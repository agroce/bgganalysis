2 player game, it was good but I definitely want to try this one again with 3 or 4 players.  I feel that each player took their own companies rather than investing in all companies.

RATING: 9
A unique spin on stock holding, area control, programmed actions and worker placement mechanisms all mixed together with an ingenious card action selection mechanism that results in a greater than its sum of its parts.

The game lasts 7 rounds, and each player is trying to score the most points by: a) colonizing a map of Africa, using potentially 4 different trading companies, whose value (shares) increase with the more area they take up on the map (tied to this is a unique and variable stock track which you want to push your player colour up on to increase your interest in that company and which also opens up abilities and benefits as extra incentive), b) improving your diamond mining, which is essentially an indivual point track you move up on and which can unlock an extra card (action) slot, c) improving your bookkeeping, which is yet another individual track you can move along and which can also unlock an extra card/action slot, but unlike the diamond track this track can be individualized with the books you need to place on it and the benefits those books pay out, and d) each gold coin is worth a point, although money is generally very tight. 

A players turn consists of programming their action cards into 3 slots (although this can be upgraded up to 5 slots) and then simultaneously revealing and choosing between a card or disk action on your turn.  Card actions can be buying more cards, pushing your colour up a share track, bookkeeping, or diamond mining and disk actions can be start player, buying cards for money, tossing cards for money, hiring helpers for the next round for money, or having majority in a category to gain movement up a share track. Your disks are very limited while the disk choices are many and your card actions once used must be distributed amongst three columns meaning you will likely not see two of those cards for several turns (this mechanism is very original and tricky). After your actions are completed you will choose ONE column of cards to add to your existing hand and then repeat the three column card programming the next round. 

The game scales very well for 2-4 players, it has a very interesting mash up of mechanisms and it feels quick, tense, and strategic an has several paths to victory. The theme is somewhat original and marginally immersive. Seems like s very expandable game.  Own the [boardgame=213293]Cooked Books[/boardgame] mini expansion.

RATING: 8.5
It has unique theme that caught my attention, stock market with familiar Euro mechanics, a bit of deckbuilding (Concordia-like), worker placement (you have 2. Some special actions spaces, majority goods/travelers spaces & buying extra action tile for next round), area control where you spend travelling points to build trading posts on the map with bonuses & open up the coin spaces of each companies to be multiplied with each score tracks (multiplier like in Orleans) & unlock special ability, fulfill requirements to advance on bookkeeping track & use diamond merchants to advance on diamond track, the last 2 tracks can unlock 2 more card spaces to play each round. Most points win. What's very unique about Mombasa is that the companies are not tied to any player, every player can have shares & expand any of the companies, the red/orange/white/black buildings are not attached to any player. It feels almost like a semi-coop game and I kinda like it. The player aid is very useful. This is a confirmed 3-hours game with full quorom of 4 players. 

Part area control, part deckbuilding, intertwined mechanisms that make the game tight & engaging. The rules a bit restrictive but the action phase is actually easy with only 5 options to choose from and limited by the cards in your slots. Very good Euro game for any player counts (2/3/4)

3 plays / 2,3,4 players

LIKE: Many options, and some possibilities for interesting combinations. The map is the best part, as it feels like a combative map without actual combat and possibly fight yourself. Good variability with the tracks. Innovative card management.

DISLIKE: Many rules that could easily be forgotten. The theme is dry. Rampant analysis paralysis can leave me feeling fatigued. The diamond and bookkeeping track on the personal boards feel disjointed.

OVERALL: This is a great, mentally crunchy game. With more players the decisions are even more tense. I didn't feel this was a stock game, but more of a combination of hand management and worker placement game. Lots of little mechanics that come together and offer room for exploration.

Really enjoyed my first play.  The combination of Euro mechanics, area control and stocks really worked for me.  This is my favourite use of stocks in a game.  Looking forward to exploring this more.  Negatives : dark theme and the book track seems inelegant.

Rock solid medium weight Euro that will stretch your mind with smart card play that needs to be well managed through a series of discard piles and draw backs. It gives the game a punch that sets it far apart. The rest of the trappings are things seen before - a bit of light deck building, some area control, bonus tiles if you're very nice, and the like. Extremely well produced and definitely a polished game. Enjoyed it very much.

Grandísimo euro, con unas decisiones muy variadas y opciones diferentes para ganar. La temática podría ser el cultivar mejillones en Marte sin desmerecer el juego xD Pero que es un euro puro y muy bueno!

There are so many things going on simultaneously in Mombasa that the game requires your full attention all the time. In most other games, you only worry about the moves until the end of the round, or until the very beginning of the next round at maximum. Normally it is your general strategy that gives you the roadmap beyond the tactical horizon and you you do not need extrapolate too deep into the future. In Mombasa however, the tactical horizon spans over two rounds at least. This is because, the actions you play this round will be next available to you in two rounds or later. So planning your actions poses a challenge, and the game is guaranteed to give many of those 'Oh s***!' moments when you realise you've messed up. You also need to have a more or less fixed strategy at the start because altering the course of the ship on the fly might prove challenging if the actions you need are not available to you at that very moment. And since the game lasts only 7 rounds, waiting 2 rounds for the actions does not sound like a winning plan.

In practice this means, that the first few plays are strictly for learning. Sure, there is player interaction in form of blocking and speculation, but most of your energy will be consumed elsewhere. After learning how to phase your actions thus getting into the "zone", the game transforms into a an interactive mix of action selection, area control, majority speculation and worker placement mechanics. A notable feature of the game is that there is no score track so players can only speculate who is winning. Almost all information is public but it is spread across such a big surface that there is little point of trying to keep track of all points except in the tightest of play groups. And still the value of shares can change either way, so the game is better played with a gut feeling.

The long learning curve and the need to plan many moves ahead send Mombasa to the heavier end of the spectrum. It is not the behemoth from your worst nightmares, but it still a beast to reckon, I would say. For gamers who fancy a challenge, this is a nice choice. For more casual gaming, do yourself a favour and look elsewhere.

Relatively tense, longer, middle-to-heavy weight Euro with plenty of moving pieces.  Pretty much all of the mechanics are familiar, and there are a few too many things going on.  This is not a point salad game, though.  Lots of paths to victory, sure, but with a 1-hour explanation/setup time, I'm not sure the fun warranted it.  The bits have some tiny, tiny icons...even if the art is great.  I already traded it away, as the super-dense rulebook won't be conducive to repeat play on the timeline I can offer.

1st play: This is a really good game. It blends a stock/ownership element with a minor deckbuilding component and there's some hand management thrown in. Teaching it is long, but once you get going the rules make sense and fit together well. Plenty to consider with each move and racing to various elements is rewarded. It seems like there are multiple viable paths to victory, and actions are very tight. Looking forward to my next play.

2nd play: I like the variability of the city tracks, they produce different powers each game, and in this play I took a totally different route. I like the idea of speculating on which companies will be worth the most at the end game and then trying to make those companies stronger. The downside to this game is that it hasn't been that long since my last play and I forgot how some of the mechanics worked. If you strip down some of the extra complexity, the game of stock predicting is fun but is done better in some other stock games. Still enjoyable to play.

This one is one of the best surprises I had this year (2017) so far. I always though I would enjoy this game, but wasn't sure it would be so much. It is a pearl of a game with so refreshing mechanics well used here. Everything connects very well, and the theme, in spite of being pasted, is ok with the mechanics. The hand management system in this game is very interesting and it is the best feature of this complex game.

Very complex and requires careful planning for several rounds in advance. Well, ideally. I can't plan this good, but like the game. Unfortunately, with 2 players it seemed a little bland and better with 3.

I like a lot of interweaving mechanisms, the thing that you should pay attention to other players and plan your moves with that in mind. Also I like the opportunity to gain different "specialisations" because of track bonuses. Although, I don't like much aggression on the map.

multiple plays: fantastic with a bit of a kingmaker problem at the very end. love it though.

2 plays so far, at 2p and 3p. VERY much want to try a 4p. The action selection in this game is brilliant, and provides the bulk of the tension. You want to delay, delay, delay, but sometimes there are things you NEED to do NOW. In 2p the map doesn't fill up particularly full, with 3p we saw all the companies earnestly in play, but because companies get to keep 4 dollar columns safe, we had 3 $4/share companies and 1 $8/share company. It would be very interesting indeed if this protection didn't exist. But still, the game is incredible. The first time you manage to move up like 6 books in a single bookkeeping action, you'll agree with me.

This is a medium to heavy euro with some interesting mechanisms that make for a fun challenge for seasoned euro gamers.  The card play feels particularly original.  On the downside,  I did not feel immersed in a theme, but the general use of coffee, bananas, diamonds and cotton as resources to "buy" things (cards and advancement on stock tracks) felt euro-ish and within the general theme of "African ventures" enough.  I like it, though perhaps not love it.

Seems like it would play better with more than 2 players as it would encourage more competition. That said, it still works well enough with 2-player to remain interesting. Card selection can be difficult at times as you wrestle with trying to out-maneuver your opponent, get what you want, and try to consider what cards you have left, where they'll be discarded, and which stack you'll be reclaiming.

Really fun game. I'm not sure how it will stand the test of time, but right now its going strong. When I moved to the variable setup instead of the recommended beginner setup I think it greatly improved the game. The beginner setup leads to "obvious" strategies that force you to play the strategy or be left behind doing your own thing. While part of the game is identifying the likely-to-be-popular strategies the variable setup makes it less obvious what people will value highly.

Leading off with a super-solid 8 after a single 3P play. Setup for new players was prohibitively discouraging, but we could all tell from the rules that there was something good. Closest analog for me would probably be Russian Railroads: many paths, initially opaque, missing its mechanic theme (share-holding). I liked RR, and seem to love this. Obvious potential for AP and botches with the multi-turn planning. Looking very forward to more plays.

After a long two hour read through comprehensive rules set, started to play.  Both opponents AP prone and the game took over three hours.  Much too long.  The game was cleverly put together.  The card drafting from the board is the latest development of the payment mechanic first introduced in Dirk Henn's Show Manager.  The shifting of the map ownership by the four powers worked much better than I expected, being quite fluid, but not too painful as the double city coin fields could not be overwritten.  The coins giving value to the cities.  The board and the cities had some similarities to the corals in Reef Encounter.  The card hand management was clever and inspired as were the increase in hand limit mechanism.  I bought little so on the least couple of rounds failed to fill my five slots.  But all the systems seemed fine tuned and well balanced.  Even my promotion to 8 shares in the explorer section only yielded an extra point when weighing up the alternatives.  There seems plenty to explore about the game, which I hope to do with less AP prone opponents.

One of the best eurogames released in 2015. A medium-heavy game with a great deal of interaction, playing in a reasonable amount of time, is a rare gem: Mombasa delivers on many levels with a great story arc, shared incentives and the need to plan no matter what you do.

There is a lot of stuff going on: players take actions mixing (simultaneous secret) card programming and worker placement, aiming at stock acquisition in companies but also trying to improve their personal boards (to unlock additional card slots and score points).

Alexander Pfister scores another hit after Broom Service. It's a designer I will be watching closely.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Area majority: check, stocks: check, multiple paths to victory: check, asymmetric powers: check. Its my opinion that this is Alexander Pfisters best work. The mechanics fit together like the teeth of various cogs. There is a lot to play with here and I've enjoyed every play. I know some people thing that there is a company in the game that is overpowered but that might be group think. For me and my group we've seen other companies and other strategies win.

Some very interesting twist on mechanics - books that have requirements but can be skipped in groups, action spaces that need showing majorities, limited cards you can get back each turn, variable share tracks that increase in value through expansion, buying new cards only with the same kind of good.

RATING: 9
Yes, the theme will be an issue for some people and won't attract people to the game. But, hey, unlike most euro games, you actually think about the theme even as you disapprovingly move through some of its abstraction.  Setting aside the theme, the mechanisms are mixed together into quite the system. The game requires strategic planning on multiple levels including the hand-building aspect and the importance of generating points efficiently. Each round also provides a good amount of tactical decisions and interaction between the players is more than simply blocking an action space. This is not a game where you can ignore what your opponents are doing. There is a stock aspect to the game, but its much weaker than a more traditional stock game. There's lots of little important moments in the game and it'll take a number of plays to truly see the various paths through the game. This will play significantly better at 3 or 4 players. It's quite good.

There's at least one issue that needs a bit more play to before my opinion is more fully fleshed out. The board play and investment tracks might lean a bit too far towards the first mover. As players attempt to catch up on an investment track, benefits flow to any player higher up the track, too. As players attempt to catch up on expanding the coverage of trade depots (I think that's what they're called from memory), those players may need to expand more resources. The former incentivizes investment in competing companies. The latter incentivizes investment in the same company. Might update after a few more plays.

The book tokens are way too small.

A few cute mechanisms drive an action-drafting-ish "stock" game. The stock portion isn't very interesting - all you are doing is committing further to a particular neutral color being valuable by the end of the game. The cute mechanisms are cute, but don't provide many interesting decisions, just typical Euro efficiency and synergy bonuses. The simultaneous action selection also adds a chaos factor that was annoying.

The cute mechanisms make this a 6 - but when the novelty wears off, I'm pretty sure this will be a 4.

I wish I have bought this game sooner, rules seemed very convoluted that I dismissed it at first glance of rulebook. However, every aspect of the game is actually tied together very well and quite easy to grasp before you are halfway through the game. 

This game is heavy, the hand management is so unique that it's a puzzle in itself, unlike any game I have played before. Bookkeeping track is also another mini puzzle itself to handle. I like the stocks aspect as well, different incentives to expand different companies and also the balance between expanding a company or acquiring more stocks for it. Love this game, player interaction is pretty good for a Euro. Lastly, the game doesn't feel long at all cause I'm engrossed throughout the game.

Euro mechanism mecca. They throw everything but the kitchen sink at this game and it somehow works really well. There's worker placement, there's a sort of deck building, there are stock tracks, there's a sort of area control thing as well. Very solid game that is unlikely to disappoint a fan of mid- to midheavy euros.

I had tempered expectations for Mombasa and I will need more plays. The stock manipulation aspect of the game seems to work and I like the planning and build up. Still, it also feels like there may be a bit too much swing and king-making late in the game within the territories of Africa.

Themeless mish-mash of mechanics that has an unpleasant, and thus utterly unnecessary, theme.  Definitely better at 3-4 players.  Lots to crunch on but that is largely driven by all the mechanics piled onto one another.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
All of Alexander Pfister's games have been good so far, but this is his masterpiece (so far).  What a neat take on a stock game, with a really cool hand management mechanism.  Is this the best Euro game from 2015?  It could be...

RATING: 7
July 2016 - I have played this four times now and enjoy the heck out of it.  Everything matters, how you place your cards, what you do and the timing that goes with it.  It all ties together very well and there is a bit of theme here, too.  I'm now of the belief that you really need to see how the game is going to get your points.  Long term mixed with short term but a mixed bag of gaining points is the way to go (and you can do that in a variety of ways, leading to the creativity I like in a game).

This game pleases me.

I passed on this game at Essen, but wanted to play it. I couldn't ever find a spot at a demo table but I am still eager to at least try it. 

Update: I ended up getting this game in a trade. It is a really fun and interesting game. On one hand, it is just a bunch of Euro mechanics stuffed together, but on the other hand it has several unique twists. The card play and discard mechanism is great and leads to meaty timing decisions. The timing of the worker placement, card buying, and expansion really adds tension as well. Finally, I really enjoyed the "light" stock element. It made the company expansion area majority game much more tolerable because players are free to cross invest. I also really liked the fact that I could buy cards with shares. This reminded me of Concordia and added some mystery to end game scoring.

Overall a really enjoyable game. I'm glad I picked this one up as a medium heavy game.

// Almost but not quite point salad. There are several
elements going on at the same time--area control, worker
placement, drafting, hand management--but each one is 
light enough and integrates well enough with the rest of 
the game that it feels like it all fits together into a

Mind blowing game!

It seems very complicated, but in the 2nd turn of the game you'll be like "oooh, that's the way it works!!! Oh I get it now".... and from then on, the game speed increases a lot.

This game doesn't innovate with new mechanics, but you'll feel that you're being presented to something that you've never have seen before. That's because it mixes a lot of clever mechanics, all of them inter-related... and at the end, everything makes sense (mechanics wise).

So many different strategies, so many hard decisions. A challenging game, that has a big learning curve (at least, if you want to play it well).

The theme seems dry, but you'll focus on the mechanics rather than the theme itself. 

This is a lock! A game to play and to keep!

RATING: 7
Not bad, very well designed, but punishing with little opportunity to catch up.  Which is fine.  But you have to have too many things lined up and ready to fire at the same time, and when they don't you kinda blow up your turn (and the next one... and the game).

Should be big among the Euro crowd, definitely a game I will never be good at though.

I think I would've enjoyed this more, but on first play I just didn't get the books track.  Not understanding how that worked bothered me the entire game.  Have to get more plays in to see if this changes but not sure if I'll get there... feels pretty themeless.

RATING: 9
Una delicia de juego... dura siete turnos. En cada turno, el jugador escoge jugar una serie de cartas, que le van a permitir hacer acciones (aumentar en un track, comprar cartas, explorar, o colocar trabajadores). 
En el juego hay cuatro "empresas" y a cada una de ellas corresponde un track. Cuando avanzas por ese track vas ganando "acciones" de dicha empresa. Con la acción de explorar, se van consiguiendo cosas y despejando una zona con "casitas" de dicha empresa, que van desvelando monedas, que al final de la partida serán el valor de cada acción conseguida de esa empresa (multiplicadores).
Cada jugador posee además un tablero para los diamantes y los libros... cada uno de esos items, se refleja en un track que también otorgará puntos al final de la partida.
Lo más llamativo es la planificación que requiere de las cartas a utilizar y cómo utilizarlas, porque al final de cada turno, cada carta pasa a una pila de descartes diferente después de que el jugador haya escogido una de las pilas para añadir a su mano. Es un método original y que aporta mucho quebradero de cabeza al juego.
Muy, muy interesante, pero sólo para jugones. A la altura de Troyes o Bruxelles. Una joyita, vamos.

Not really worker-placement, not really area-control, and not really share-buying, but elements of all three combined into a tasty strategy game with plenty of paths to victory.

I have mixed feelings about this one.  While it was one of the better new games at bgg con from 2015, it still didn't entirely wow me.   I think it's a solid euro, with a number of conflicting goals with little time to accomplish them all.   The problem is that the card restrictions are incredibly severe, to the point where it is very difficult to get an engine going because it takes so long for cards to come back to your hand.   That leaves me wanting more in this game, and feeling a little unsatisfied by the end.

So we'll rate it a 7 for now, and see how a few more plays go.

There's a lot going on here - action planning at the start of each round supplemented by worker placement actions; expansion on the board needing to be matched by increasing your share holding and both deck building to increase the options you have (and their power) and hand management as it takes time to recycle cards you've used ... another aspect needing forward planning. And three very different ways of scoring points - six if you count the different flavours of company, and seven if you count cash ... which is less important than the others but not irrelevant. While there's a lot going on it meshes well together - though the bookkeeping track may be just a bit too clever for its own good - and it all rattled along at a pretty good pace, even though it was our first play and we're generally a slow group. Very impressed and looking forward to playing more.

RATING: 7
A classic "so much to do but not enough time to do it" type of game, where there are many ways to score points, but no way to get everything accomplished that you wish to accomplish. So, you must of course choose what to focus on, as not every path to riches will be as efficient as others.

Mombasa is also a game of timing, as the discard mechanism makes you cycle your hand of cards in an interesting way. In order to pull off a power move, it'll take some planning, and due to the game mechanism, you won't just be able to repeat that power move over and over, so you'll need to find useful things to do as you build toward those mega-turns.

Quite a bit to digest overall, but looking forward to trying different strategies in future games!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.75
Certainly some interesting and novel mechanisms here, such as the simultaneous action selection with cards going to discard piles above your player board.  I also enjoyed the investing and spreading of colonies.

It felt though like there was too much extraneous bits going on which deterred from the core elements.  The diamond track was slightly annoying, providing an extra unnecessary step to VP.  Likewise the book track just seemed like work and the steps involved mind numbing.  

There's some good stuff here but it's not for me.  No excitement or drama.  Too much cruft and extra layers for the sake of it, definitely a post-Agricola Euro with the philosophy that more is more.

I fell in love with the design of this game as I was playing it. Everything ties together so seamlessly, and for all it's supposed complexity, it makes so much sense and there's very little in doubt once you start playing. The discard piles, and building of future hands ties it all together in a wonderful elegant package. This game will probably always stay in my collection. Top notch.

Initial thoughts based on run-through. Rule book was done with a very close attention to detail, Thank You for that. The implementation of the stock market is brilliant and isn't a make or break for a winning strategy though, I imagine, if one pursed it hard enough it can be. Will give a better assessment after a few plays.

6/8/2017 (MASTERPIECE #6 of 10) Mombassa is a certified gem. I really like the Book/gem tracks and the pushing of the different stocks is just fun. The game will cause AP in even the best most efficient players for that very reason ...they want to be efficient. The best players will comb though all their option right down to, where am I going to slot this card for a later turn. Beautiful in design, Mezmerizing in gameplay, and deep in strategy Mombassa will be the main course for many a game night. Again, if If I did a top 10 for rule books this would for sure be in the top 5. Well done.  

Pfister is on a roll and is one of the reasons there is so much buzz in the board gaming hobby as people scramble to get this game. Mombassa is currently OOP as of this writing and  his follow up of Great Western Trails puts him right up there with the top game designers. What he does for a trifecta is anyones guess but is exciting to anticipate.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very difficult to rate. There is a lot of interaction on the board, but I found the way the shares worked and the board back and forth to be fairly undramatic and unthematic. It feels to me more like an efficiency game than anything else, as I can tell there are ways to run an efficient engine in this game, and just playing and thinking about it enough will unlock its secrets. Those kinds of games always bother me a little.

That said, it deserves additional play. The hand management decisions are tough and interesting, and the dance between forced cooperation and competition is good.

Mombasa is a game that I wasn't looking forward to playing based on how it was advertised on BGG--1 hour of rules, complex Euro with multiple mechanics, 2-3 hour play time, AP prone. Ugh.

However, having played it, I'd say it is better than I thought :) Although they are not direct parallels, I want to compare it to something like Imperial 2030, a game I like a lot. I can dig the stock element, I enjoyed the action selection bit. The only knock on the game is that there seems to be just a bit too much thrown in. I'd rather have a rondel than the card pile selection thing. I'd rather not have the inkwell/contract track.  There's an elegance and simplicity to Imperial 2030, and I missed that feeling when playing this game. It's like buying a car with bells and whistles that you don't want. But having said that, I'd happily play it again. If Imperial 2030 isn't in my bag :)

In the design team's rush to put together a game with a half dozen game mechanisms they latched onto the theme of African colonization.  say what?  If someone was really interested in Africa they could have done a game about competing kingdoms in Africa's pre-colonial 'golden age' or done a contemporary/futuristic game about developmental augmentation (tech, env, social, music, etc).   This game scrapes the bottom of the age of discovery and treads over some of the most egregious exploitation.   It's all too bad, and thumbs down.

Solid shared ownership and hand management game. I found the main mechanisms interesting but not novel by a long shot, and the game felt too contrived and not very elegant. I could list 10 mechanisms here, I feel half should have been removed during development. Things like the various bonus tiles, the duplicate diamond/book tracks, and the 4 share tracks with different bonus each, the whole felt like an exercise in layering. The end result is an AP prone and long game. And don't get me started about the tiny book chits that are unreadable across the board... Solid but not exciting, I'd rather play Imperial or a real stock game.

I would play it again if I had no other choice, but will not seek it.

This is another "points salad" where all possible mechanisms and ideas are stolen from other games and pasted together. Also, I dislike games that contain a very big map at the centre but most of the action takes place elsewhere in very small spots.

Said all of this, Mombasa is a beautifully engineered artefact that actually works. None of the mechanisms has any sense (like the weird book-keeping tasks) of elegance (like the clunky deck-building part that is not deck-building), but it is very entertaining. I suspect that, given the very limited scope of each sub-game, I will get tired of Mombasa before reaching a good comprehension of the game, thus, not being able to enjoy all the replayability-enhancing qualities of the design.

When I see a game like this, I suspect the designer took this development strategy:

- Ok, we have this game with a map and some cards, but it is so random that most of the time you can do nothing at all with the cards. Any ideas?
- Well... we can add parallel and independent sub-games where to spend your resources in a different combination of patterns. So you always get something to do.
- You are hired.

You know those games where you can't do everything you wanna do? Yeah, this is one of those. Seems solid on 1st play. Only real concern is not that companies may not be balanced (I don't really care, since players are free to choose what companies they invest in), but that the engine snowballing is extreme. It seems to me that the win condition could be rewritten "the first player to unlock all 5 card slots wins". I don't see any alternative to that. Anyway, looking forward to trying again.

I really wanted to love this. I'm a huge fan of Imperial and this shares a fair amount of it's "DNA". Unfortunately, it's been contaminated with a point salad that short circuits some of the interesting parts of the game. Not that I hate point salads, it's just that it's inclusion means that the whole is less than the sum of it's parts. I'd only recommend playing this at 4 players. At 3, the game is too spacious and not worth the high play time, though I can't see this returning to the table terribly often. If I'm playing a game this long at this player count, why am I not playing Brass or Imperial, which are superior in every way?

Euro durillo. A explotar África! Temática más pegada que los juegos del Feld. Al principio abruma, pero con un par de rondas, pillas más o menos las mecánicas... eso sí, es difícil hacerlo bien. Aquí creo que es más rentable centrarse en un par de cosas que intentar abarcar un poco de todo. Me gustan algunos juegos durillos, pero éste me resultó un poco coñazo y estaba deseando que acabara la partida. Más que una diversión, para mí fue como un trabajo. 'Bombasa' pa la 'cabesa'!

One playthrough (so I shouldn't really rate it, but here we are) however everyone really enjoyed it - far more than we expected.

Very decent euro. Card hand management and a small element of worker placement. This is a game which rewards a little bit of thought as to your play process and getting efficiency out of your 3 (or 4-5) cards.

Looking forward to playing again soon.

On reprend l'histoire des noirs, mais en Afrique, cette fois. Et on change un peu les rôles.  Nous serons des négociants européens en pleine période de colonisation et nous allons tenter de nous enrichir un maximum en développant nos comptoirs commerciaux. On est dans un pur jeu de gestion. Avec une mécanique de gestion de carte assez maligne, nous allons étendre nos comptoirs entre Mombasa et le Caire, récupérer des parts des compagnies les plus intéressantes, exploiter les mines de diamants. Bref, faire fortune. Et le plus riche sera le gagnant. Heureusement, le jeu ne met pas en avant l'exploitation du peuple africain (et le précise même dans les règles, il se contente de se placer sur une période historique qui s'est vraiment passé, sans parti pris). Cela reste un très bon jeu dans sa catégorie qui ravira ceux qui aiment se casser les neurones.

RATING: 4
TL;DR much too long for the decision involved no long term strategy, no way to be creative, just grinding VPs for 2-2h30. Theme is non-existent. Whatever type of game you are looking for there are much better option IMO.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Rules may look a bit daunting but it is actually pretty straightforward. During  a game turn:
- Each player secretly choose 3 (later 4-5) action cards from his own deck.
- Then all cards are revealed at once
- Finally players take turn resolving their cards OR using one of their 2 tokens to choose a special action.

There is a deck-building element as you can purchase better action cards for your deck. Unfortunately with only 7 turns in the game those cards will only be used, roughly, twice or less.

There is also a workers placement mechanic, but combined with the simultaneous secret selection of action cards it gives odd results, as depending on the cards selected around the table some actions might be more or less contested. And with seven turns it doesn't even out enough.

All individual actions are quick and simple to execute, except the bookkeeping action, which is a kind of solo puzzle which put a heavy drag on play and feels much too long compared to the other actions.

From a strategic perspective, the problem is how companies shares increase/decrease. The more players investing on a single company the more each share of that company will give VPs. So other players should rather forget about other companies and jump on the train. This kills most long term planing. Moreover they are not actually "shares" as each player get full value for his investment regardless of the number of other players investment.

Money = VP, and many actions are of the type spend x VP to gain y VP. Which add to the impression that he game is a dry, and very long, bookkeeping exercise.

Overall it is hard to plan even two turns ahead, it feels more a matter of grinding VPs as the opportunities arise. That would be OK for a shorter game but with 4 players the game clocks at 2-2h30 (thanks to the odd bookkeeping phase) which is much too long for the decisions involved. Considering the length of the game, 7 turns feels too short to balance the chaos of simultaneous actions selection.

It feels like Dr Frankenstein's creature, a mash-up of mechanisms that doesn't work so well together nor support the theme. Disappointment and frustration.
Rated 4 following BGG guideline, but maybe a 3 as the desire to play again is so low.

 Maybe better with 2.

After several plays I like it, but I'm not sure why. This is the type of game I usually make fun of due to all the different things going on that seemingly have no connection. For some reason it holds together for me though. I certainly understand the criticisms, and am a bit surprised by all the awards. I dunno...is this a game I'll be able to get people to play in the future? Teaching it is a bitch. Hmmmm.

RATING: 8
Worker placement meets deck building in an economic game in which you really need to carefully plan your every move. The order in which you play your actions (both intra-turn and across different turns) is crucial. The crux of the game is to invest in succesful African companies. During the first rounds the 4 companies can grow together, but once the entire African continent has been taken, the growth of company A is always at the expense of company B, C or D. The points salad can also be fed from advancement on a diamond track and a bookkeeping track. Playing on these tracks further opens the possibility to use 4 or 5 cards from your hand instead of only 3 each turn.

I had high hopes for this game and it hasn't hit that mark yet. The game feels like the kitchen sink of game design. There's an area control aspect, there's a stock market, there's card play, there's a worker placement area, etc. While it kind of comes together to make a single game it still all feels separate. It's in the same boat at Trajan after my play through.

About the theme: Yes, it's centered around the very bleak theme of colonization in Africa and the exploitation of that area of the world. Other than the flavor text in the rules, the map and some of the African themed images, it's theme-less. It's just another thing dragging down the rating of what was a highly hyped game.


[18 April 2017] - 8 (2 plays)
Was able to get another run through of this game in at a weekend meetup group. We played with 3 players that had some experience with the game and it went smooth. Much smoother than I remember my first play. The decisions are tough (Do I want to claim the bonus diamond track trader now? Will it still be open by my next turn?) and there aren't enough rounds to really avoid being aggressive. This last game, we ended up battling over region control between the players as we tried to jockey for the best stock positions. The theme is still kind of a downer and probably makes what is otherwise a fantastic set of mechanisms a non-starter for a lot of people.

Weighty worker placement-based Euro centered around a mind-numbing pre-deterministic hand management/action selection mechanic. Players invest in stocks of neutral chartered companies then influence stock value via area control, with significant investment returning mechanical bonuses to personal economy/progress in secondary markets. Much thinking. (November 2015)

Everything you do effects everything else. Incredible interactions, brilliant mechanisms. I played last night and the afternoon before and my mind keeps wandering back to it. It's been years since a game has given this lasting an impression. I'm under the Mombasa spell.

edit: Has any designer had a better year than Pfister in 2015? Isle of Skye, Broom Service, Oh My Goods! and to top it all the jewel Mombasa. 

After four plays this game is absolutely brilliant. Fast, fun, deep and as always with Pfister, the magic moment, 'the big reveal'. This seems to be a part of all Pfister's designs, the moment when you realize if your plan comes together or if you're going to be scrambling to patch up the mess you've made...

Mombasa appears to give you lots of interesting choices.  Which railway do you invest in, which do you build out.  There are a lot of games with this buy-stock or make-stock-more-valuable type of choice.  This one uses a cool card mechanic to make this happen.   You pick 3 cards from your hand, put them face down and everyone reveals...those are your actions.   And those cards will be out of play for future rounds until you recycle them.  There are some games with that mechanic too...like Dungeon Lords.  But it all goes together well.  My only concern is there is the "everyone else is doing that, i have to too".  The end result is that one railway gets built out heavily (Mombasa) and bought into by everyone.  Another one (Cairo) doesn't see any action the entire game.  More plays needed, but this is my only negative reaction.

The variety of actions and mechanisms in Mombasa work together smoothly to create a very satisfying game experience. It offers opportunities to build up for big, exciting moves, and provides multiple paths to score well. The game is fun, and not as complex to play as it might seem. However, it takes a long time to teach, due to the large number of mechanisms included. Time to teach and length of play will limit the number of times it gets played. Also, it looks like all games will focus on exploring, with players looking for chances to also advance the other areas when able, so it might begin to feel repetitive. That is why I rate it 8 and not higher, but it is an excellent game.

Mombasa is a complex Euro strategy game, in the tradition of recent games such as Rococo, Madeira, and Marco Polo.  If you like those games you will love Mombasa.

At heart this is a card drafting game, similar to Rococo in that you have a deck of cards which you add to during the game, and from which you take three cards into each round which determine which actions you take (you can take more than three later in the game if you open up new card slots).   And added in there is some Worker Placement which you access with your tokens for more actions.   

The game is reasonably simple (a lot simpler than Madeira for example) in that the cards only really serve 5 actions.  Once you understand these actions you are away.    The beauty is in the way these actions all inter-twine in a style you see on games such as Madeira or Bora Bora.

The Victory Points you get in the game accrue from the two points tracks on your player board and then from your shareholdings in the four railways which expand and/or contract during the game on the communal player board.  

So what’s so good about it?  

-The systems intertwine so seamlessly and effortlessly that it makes me gasp at the sheer brilliance of the elegant design.  
 
- The interactivity is high, not only in the fight for the Worker Placement spaces on the board but also for the limited cards available to purchase.  And then most significantly in the fight for the railways on the shared board:  you can expand a railway which you have a high shareholding into areas held by other railways in which you don’t hold shares and push them back, thus devaluing their share price whilst increasing the share price of your favoured rail company.  These network expansion ‘battles’ become significant in the late game.

- The paths to victory are not scripted:  you don’t have to specialise in one thing or another.  You can do a bit of everything and still compete.  The points tracks generally grow in a linear fashion.  This means that you don’t have that slightly frustrating feeling which you get in games where, when you follow one path, the benefits grow exponentially so thatyou are stuck doing that for the whole game:  that does not happen here.

- The card play is so clever as the limitations on bringing cards back into your hand are determined by where they are positioned amongst the three card slots.  This forces you to think a turn or two ahead and gives the brain a wonderful workout.

- The decision-making tree is full of really interesting options.  Nothing is bad, but trying to determine what is most optimal is very rewarding: the game just feels great to play.


That’s it really:  the game just feels great to play.  It is undoubtedly heavy, but not heavy in rules as the rules are fairly intuitive, just heavy in the complexity of the decisions you will take.  This and Marco Polo are my top Euro strategy games for 2015, and I think this one may just take the pole position.


Total brilliance in a game.

Another home-run by Pfister. Incredible decision making opportunities. Lots of different victory paths to explore. Interaction with your opponents. A very tough hand management system that takes a few plays to master. My biggest complaint is that because anyone can alter the share values of companies, someone can come in near the end and devalue the companies you've heavily invested in all game, which comes across as a bit meaner than necessary.

2016-01-04 : Medium-heavy game that has this quality I came to appreciate a lot in games : the layout and graphics of the board are the rules of the game. Our first 4-player game ended in a nail-biter with 1 point separating first and second place, both using entirely different strategies. This is most promising. Needs another game to solidify the initial good impression.
2016-01-30 : Second game with another group and another nail-biter - there are a lot of paths to victory in this game and a lot of ways to mess each other up. Timing is critical and you must plan 1 or even 2 turns ahead. A keeper.
2016-02-12 : 3rd game and three new paths to victory were explored - all were deemed viable - and the playtime was under 2 hours. This seals it, I'm upgrading this one from an 8 to a 10
2016-02-16 : Played a 2-player game - I've now played it with all player counts and the gameplay is virtually identical with all player counts. 
2017-01-01 : Rating lowered to 8 - my desire to play this one again has dropped.

Mombasa is a strange, but decent game. I say this because it's somewhat of a Frankenstein's monster of mechanisms, with a theme of the exploitation and colonization of Africa. That said, the mechanisms are less fiddly than you would imagine despite all of the things going on, and it does feel strangely thematic for a euro game.

A major aspect of the game are the four companies and the shares that can be invested into these companies. You would be wrong if you thought this was going to be a re-themed train game because there are many differences. For example, there are no auctions of shares and companies can kick each other out of regions which lower their value of their shares. In addition, there are 8 unique company tracks that dictate a variety of things (such as special actions/benefits/share structure/capital investment/etc) and 4 of these tracks are randomly assigned to the different companies. When companies take over areas on the board, not only do they increase their value, but they provide the player expanding the company various benefits that tie in with other aspects of the game. Like train games though, the company and shares mean that temporary alliances/parasitic relationships can form throughout the game.

The above sounds interesting in it's own right, but then you have a variety of other things going on in the game. In the action phase, players will secretively and simultaneously choose 3 cards (maybe up to 5 over the course of the game) which will allow them to perform actions in addition to the few standard worker placement pawns each player has available. At the end of the round players will move the 3 (to 5) cards to 3 (to 5) distinct discard piles and before doing so, will add one of the discard piles to their hand of cards. It's almost like playing multiple hands of Concordia simultaneously. If that sounds tough, consider that face-up cards require careful planning to allow players to take majority action spaces and fulfill book keeping requirements. The order in which you execute these actions can also be particularly important.  

If any of the above sounded interesting, you should definitely check this game out.

RATING: 9
One of my favorites of 2015. 

It has an interesting resource management system that recycles cards to reuse. 

I have been unimpressed with the book track, I have yet to see someone use it effectively. It seems slightly worse than the diamonds for getting an extra action and considerably worse if you're trying to max it out.

I really like the different stock tracks. Some do seems to get used far far less though. I like that they change cities and are double sided. I have hopes that there will be more in the future.

Mombasa is one of my favorites.  I love that the players are the main drivers of the game state, each game becoming its own little meta as certain tracks/companies evolve differently than others.  Lots and lots of room for creative game-play while still feeling the tightness and tension because your decisions matter.

A helpful tip - while the game itself isn't terribly difficult to get your arms around, the “bookkeeping” track can be unnecessarily confusing at first, so we leave it out completely when introducing Mombasa to new players for their first game.

The basis of the game is action card programming. You program 3 a turn with the ultimate goal of a) getting shares of stock in African companies and b) operating these companies in such a way that increases their endgame value by claiming spots on the board. Companies can "fight" and push each other out of spaces so their values fluctuate all game which makes the stock gathering aspect a little murky.

The trick of the programming is that at the end of your turn, the cards you programmed go into 3 different piles with previously used cards.  Before that happens, you may pick up ONE of these piles and put back into your hand. So you have to think about a) what cards you want to play for actions and b) which pile to put them in when you're done so that c) you return the  cards you want for next and future turns. 

Therein lies the fun and the frustration. This is a game for people who like the focus of a game to be on solitaire engine building. Your biggest opponent is yourself, not the other players. Can you program your cards such that you use and return them effectively and chain powerful turns in the 7 rounds of the game? It’s pretty brain burning for sure. 

That’s not to say the game is without player interaction, but it’s secondary to the solitaire programming puzzle you face each turn. The game gets very interactive with how you use companies on the board to push other companies off the board. You work on your stuff in your garage and then every now and then you take your car out and drive on somebody's lawn, muck it up, then go back into your garage for more work. 

Whether or not the programming is fun is a matter of taste, for sure, but my concern is that the game is not as open as it appears. That is, the diamond track seems far superior to the ridiculously complicated book track. I still can’t believe that you only get the reward of the book you land on and not the ones you also jump over – all that work for such little benefit? Since book points allow you to take coins instead of a book – and money is so damn tight -- I (and my group) don’t see how that’s simply not the superior path to take every game.  

I'll be curious to see if we all end up eschewing the book track for coins and what the staying power of this one is or not.

TL;DR This theme makes me sick, and is one of the worse designer board games thematically I have ever seen, second only to Labyrinth: The War on Terror.

You can be the bad guy in historical board games, that's ok if done right. You do terrible things as the player character in Puerto Rico, but it's not seen as offensive. Why?

For one, Puerto Rico was centuries ago, while Mombasa takes place only a century before now. Imperialism is a relatively recent thing, and its consequences are still directly felt today. But the truly unforgivable piece is that Mombasa also pretends that the horrible conquest and exploitation of the African continent by European powers never happened; instead, you are just simple traders expanding your networks. This rose-colored view of history is so wildly wrong it's disgusting.

Puerto Rico, in my opinion, in addition to being a phenomenal game mechanically, achieves balance. It implicitly acknowledges the evils that went down (allowing the player to fill in the blanks) without making it so explicit and directly involved with the game so as to be off-putting.

But the piece de resistance? The game's called Mombasa (a major Kenyan city), and instead of being about the Kenyan Crown Colony, the board is all of Africa, with Mombasa being merely one starting location. They couldn't even get an appropriate title; they couldn't even get the right geographic scale.

Jól sikerült darab. Elsőre soknak tűnik a szabály, de minden elég egyértelmű játék közben, és aránylag könnyedén játszható. A kártyafelhasználós rész nagyon izgalmas és egyedi egyértelműen ez a játék legérdekesebb része. A részvenyezésért nem vagyok oda, és érzésem szerint itt eleve az a leggyengébb pont. Olyan játék, ami nem rövid mégis a végén úgy érzed, hogy nagyon kellett volna még egy forduló, mert pont most épült fel az engine-ed. Hármasban próbáltuk, de érzésem szerint négyen lehet a legjobb, mert így nem annyira indultak el a cégek. Korrekt darab, szívesen játszanék még vele.
---
Több játék után valahogy egyre kevésbé tetszett. Nagyon lélektelen, nagyon összefércelt valami. Ráadásul ez a részvényesdi simán haza tudja vágni bárki játékát, önhibáján kívül is, ami annyira nem illik a játék komolyságához szerintem.

A lot of great ideas in this one.  So many things to consider every step of the way.  I am eager to play more to see how the shuffled company tracks change up the game.  So far, we've stuck to the suggested setup.

Tricky and interesting.  The card play is difficult to plan and challenging.  Having those bonuses on the cards and round the tracks always provides something to aim for.  

Game requires considerable thought.  Like it

I believe many comments make Mombasa seem a heavier game than it actually is. It is pretty straight-forward, really. What it does, however, is force players to plan ahead a little as the card retrieval mechanism easily punishes shooting from the hip.

Then again, going in with a plan set in stone likely isn't going to accomplish much, either, as the actions of the other players have a huge impact on the relative merits of the different ways to score. This is likely Mombasa's biggest strength, and saves it from just being a game about moving up a number of tracks.

MOMBASA enthält Elemente aus unterschiedlichen Spielegattungen, die fein gedacht und homogen zu einer beweglichen Komposition ineinander fliessen: ein Atemhauch von Deckbau und Kartenmanagement, WP, mäanderndes Area Control, Mehrheitenspiel, Optimierung, Wettlauf auf den Kompanieleisten, eine Aktiengeschäftsidee, Interaktion. Im Zentrum steht die Ausdehnung von vier Handelskompanien über ganz Afrika, auf die jeder Spieler Zugrifff hat. Daraus ergeben sich frühe Fragen, deren Antworten man durchaus dem Spielverlauf anpassen muss: Auf welche Handelskompanie setze ich? Auf eine? Auf mehrere? Gehe ich mit anderen mit? Gehe ich dagegen? Was tun? Abwarten. Schauen. Flexibel reagieren. Mitlaufen im heißen Windschatten. Oder selbst Voranpreschen. Karten wegschnappen. Es gibt viel zu tun und man kann -wie so oft- nicht alles machen. MOMBASA ist ein abendfüllendes Kontinentalereignis. Die Investitionsleisten sind doppelseitig, wodurch sich immer eine andere Kombi zu Beginn des Spiels ergibt. Die kleine Varianz ist der König Afrikas. Und zur analogen Unterhaltung klingt im Hintergrund Vinyl aus den 70ern, die Belle Epoque afrikanischer Musik: Afrobeat Classics aus Nigeria, Highlife aus Ghana, Congolese Funk, Psychedelic Swahili Rumba oder senegalesischer Mbalax geben den Soundtrack zum Spieleglück und schmücken musikalisch den Raum um MOMBASA. Den moralinsauren Zeigefinger zum "dunklen Kapitel der Kolonialzeit" hat der Sieger des Autorenwettbewerbs 2011 des Hippodice Spielclubs nicht verdient und den ursprünglich eisenbahnspielaffinen Namen "Afrika 1830" gekostet. Komisch, dass die Kolonisten in PUERTO RICO die Mahner überlebt haben. MOMBASA ist ein Afro-Euro der Oberklasse, ein Gamers Game par excellence. Rumble in the Game Jungle. Es hat in mir einen Liebhaber gefunden. Die Fan-Expansion kann beginnen.

I enjoy the card selection in this game and the way you retrieve your cards. Very clever mechanic

You don't have too many actions in this game but each action requires a lot of thought. You have to plan out your future hands and what cards you have available to yourself

The different companies all have their own unique scoring as well as special ability and even the starting locations have different resources next to them.

Both the diamond and book tracks seem viable and offer bonuses. A lot of strategy and several ways to score in this game. Also I always enjoy spending coins throughout the game but which are also your VP at the end

Really want to try this one out more to explore different strategies.

Only played this game once. It's quite interesting and you do need to plan everything as perfectly as possible as you get points from few different areas and you need to do pretty good in all or most of them, in order to win the game. Maybe, if I would play it a couple more times, I would find it to be more enjoyable. It has a pretty nice complexity.

Outstanding game. 

Haven't enjoyed a new Euro game for a long time, but this one is special. Your brain is occupied by meaningful strategic and tactical decisions, not by rules overhead. Rules easy to grasp and play is super smooth and straightforward. Decisions to make are interesting and planning is required.  Theme shines through well enough for me.

Multiple paths to victory, no runaway leader problem, good balance, and smooth gameplay. Replayability seems high with rotating company abilities, card draft order, starting tiles, book draft order, etc., yet the game is not luck-dependent  Interesting card recovery mechanic adds a great element.  
 I'm totally on board with this and thinking it will become a new classic.

Read my review in the forum for more details

Really wanting to play more games soon.

The mechanic of action selection/hand management is fun but requires some planning.  Diamond track and book track can both be rewarding but I can't help thinking that streamlining some of this out of the game would have made it more interesting by allowing you to focus on more important parts.  Getting the bonus' from the books is neat.  The Pith helmets seem overpowered.  More interesting spaces on the tracks to actually place workers in lieu of diamond and book tracks would be a great way to balance out and streamline this game.

Wow. Heavy game, but also one that is NOT a burden to learn! It's very much a points crafter, everything you do gets you points somehow but each action requires well thought out plays because of the way your cards cycle. What you play now, will affect what you can play two turns from now. There's a lot going on here, but the design is tight. I enjoy that there is also player interactivity/screwage through the Expand action, which is a bit like an area control game. I definitely want to revisit this game a few more times.

Complaints about the theme are a strange beast. I felt like it was completely tacked on like a Feld game.

Opinion: loved the mechanic of card selection and how actions are resolved. You have to decide what to do this turn and where to allocate those actions as the cards used will not be ready for another use until you select your "rest" pile, this is amazing.
Regarding the actions, select what you are going to do and do them once a time, checking what otehrs are going to do.
Expand the Company you see more profitable, invest in that Company, go for cards, develop your diamonds or books... many paths to get victory point without being a victory point salad. Everything is very well conected

RATING: 8.6
What makes Mombasa so great is the dynamic nature of the game state. It's very easy to be in the "lead" one moment and be in last the next as players are constantly assessing the board state and pushing back on the "leader". Knowing when to keep things close to your chest, when to diversify your investments in the four companies and when to start to expand one company at the expense of the other four is paramount to the game. This means that every game is different and various strategies are necessary for success. Furthermore, the mechanics are interesting and ingenious. Significant advanced planning is needed to manage the various card discard piles, a mechanic I have not seen utilized in any other game. My only critiques of the game are that the theme doesn't attract new players to the game and the book track is unnecessarily complicated and very difficult to pull off, making it feel like a bit of an afterthought relative to other strategies.

I enjoyed this, there is a lot going on but it seems to work. There's a slight element of working with the other players in terms of increasing the value of each of the four companies, so you have to be careful not to get shut out in the cold working on one of them on your own.

I like the card mechanism and how known things got combined to form something cool, but there are also a few things I dislike.

- new cards are expensive and yet see the light of day maybe 2 times only.
- the book track just doesn't add anything, nor is it a good path to victory.
- you pretty much do the same all the time (it's a very slow game and there isn't happening much).

It's a decent game, but I just like others more.

An excellent, innovative action selection mechanic as you build and cycle through your deck. The core of the game is spent speculating and influencing share prices as you look to maximise your investments, and the variable company setup adds replayability. The diamond/bookeeping tracks provide interesting alternative paths to boost your wealth, but it's impossible to focus on everything over just seven short rounds, leading to plenty of tough decisions.

Definitely an eurogamer's dream of a game but maybe too complex for his own sake. The key here is to plan ahead in an extreme way and -while the game is rich, fun and replayable- it can burn out even the most expert gamer. Many mechanics are unnecesary and -like many other euros nowadays- it could had been improved just streamlining it.

RATING: 7.75
Mombasa is a great gamer's game, with several scoring opportunities, and all actions are basically under a player's control, with the exception being cards to purchase in the market.

Players plan actions, and then execute them to advance on the Diamond track, Bookkeeping track, or one of four company tracks, or alternately to reserve a bonus or purchase a new card from the market.

Players must weight the opportunity costs of advancing/not advancing vs. other actions at every turn- and the potential benefits are easier to see than the costs of opportunities not selected.

This is obviously a terrific game, so I am hazarding a rating after the first play, but will feel free to adjust it further with additional plays.

Lots of options to try and get a high score. I have played 4+ games and am still unsure of what a good / optimal strategy is. I like it when a game challenges my brain, and this one does.
People who like to play more based on intuition can still manage through a game, since decisions almost always amount to choosing whether to buy a card, get a bonus, develop a company or get more shares.
I like the art too!

RATING: 9.5
While there is a lot going on, the rules are not complicated. You play 3 cards and then do actions relating to whatever you have (including two tokens you place on the board) until you are out of actions. After 7 rounds, the game is over.

It is the actual planning that makes the game so interesting. Before you pass, you pick up one of your "resting stacks" above your player board. These are separate stacks of cards used on previous turn(s). Then you move your cards from the current round on top of their respective resting stack. So the order you re-aquire your cards is a bit staggered and the value of the cards vary by game (elements of the board are double-sided and can be mixed and matched randomly each game). I have never been as delightfully bewildered and in love with a game as this one.

Essentially a share acquisition and company value game with a couple of alternative ways of scoring. The base mechanics are worker placement and deckbuilding. A lot of things going on.

Wow. I just finished 3 games of this over the course of 9 hours. I will write more when I'm more coherent. This and Great Western Trail are the greatest board game duo I've ever seen. These games are clearly cut from the same cloth but extremely different. The replay-ability of this is fairly high. Definitely best at 3 or 4, and would strongly recommend not playing at 2. It's a brain burner with a decent amount of player interaction. Much more than GWT, but also more AP prone. Less streamlined but arguably deeper or maybe more complex. Which one will stay at 10 in the future? Time will tell.

Initial rating, one 2p play so far.

I like the deck-building element. I wish the game can shorten one round slightly, and get one or two more rounds to compose a "big hand".

I imagine the game will be different with 3-4p. The competition on the map will be more severe, and the stock holding will be more complex and few political elements, that may be good.

The amount of forward planning needed always takes people by surprise, and everyone who has played it in my group loves it.  This is the '9' rating game on my list most likely to be upgraded to '10' with time.

Mombasa is very fun, heavy game with dank game mechanics. The play requires players to be able to effectively plan sequences of several actions in order to score lots of points. There are several game mechanics smashed together into a delicious game design composition: area control, company stock investment, hand management, and worker placement(action drafting). It is a bit of a points salad, but there is strong player interaction here--a lot of tension, in your face. I am looking forward to playing Mombasa more. It made me think hard, which I enjoy. I like the way it has a simplified version of investing and owning shares of different companies trading with colonized Africa. There are several ways to score points in Mombasa and it is challenging to try to solve the mental puzzle of which actions to choose in order to finish on top at the end of the game. I also love it that there are so many options of things to do on your turn, and meanwhile, the game isn't coercing me on a particular path like Terra Mystica does. Highly recommended game, but tough to teach and learn as a newcomer.

One of the best euros i've ever played. Clever design, multiple ways to strategize, lots of way to victory. Mombasa has clearly gives the satisfaction of playing heavy well-deserved resource and hand management. For a first game, complex rules of the game may overwhelm newcomers but when it is played, even the most complex ones has become meaningful.

"The exploitation of the African continent and its people[s] is not explicitly depicted…”

And that’s from Mombasa’s rulebook overview, the confounding moral of which appears to be that it’s acceptable to reward gamers for economically exploiting a continent and its peoples—as Mombasa proceeds to—so long as they’re only doing so “implicitly.” Which doesn’t really make any sense at all, unless the victor is here defined along the lines of “the player with the highest score (most money earned) is the winner, thereby establishing him or herself as the most reprehensibly ‘successful’ of despicable colonial interlopers.” I’ll take last place, thanks very much.

I’ve resisted weighing in on Mombasa’s thematic premise—or, more specifically, on the grotesquely ahistorical theme-park dilution of its subject matter, as well as the mind-boggling, and contradictory, disconnect between the rulebook’s high-minded but tacked-on introduction (clumsily cobbled together, I would guess, at the last minute) and the grubbily depraved thematic ambitions of a gamer’s profit-driven alter ego—because, alas, to speak up against a game’s ugly, retrograde thematic *angle* and VP-allocation logic is to invite piñata treatment within these forums.

Generally speaking, most of the people who agree with you remain silent, whereas those more than eager to vociferously weigh in will often aggressively deride you for being either a “politically correct” milquetoast or else an insufferably over-serious grump. Mombasa, Puerto Rico (with its anonymous slaves we mustn’t ever speak of or allude to), doesn’t matter: these are the twinned tropes used to smother “party pooper” dissent time and again. One’s views ultimately don’t stand a chance against the snide, driving hostility of the exasperated eye-rollers.

But I can’t in good conscience any longer suppress my abhorrence of Mombasa’s underlying thematic perspective. I stress “perspective” because it is not the game’s historical, geopolitical context in and of itself that I oppose (a designer is of course welcome to set a game whenever and wherever he wishes), but rather the bizarre pro-profiteering *angle* of Mombasa’s first-person viewpoint within its inherently dicey thematic context.

And here is where Mombasa trespasses so egregiously. The question is not merely where and when does a round of a particular game unfold, but rather: “Who are we here?” “What does the character we embody stand for?” “What do we seek to gain?” “What does that gain actually translate into in real-world terms?” “How, and for what real-world behavior, has a game’s designer chosen to *reward* strategic astuteness?” On that count, the creators of Mombasa ought to be ashamed that they’ve linked the gamer’s celebratory fist-pump and victory point aspirations to something as unambiguously toxic as (by the manual intro’s own admission) the rapacious and systematic plundering of a continent’s natural resources, and the hoarily paternalistic denigration of its peoples. Period.

If your game-winning, VP-accumulating strategy overlaps historically with indefensible colonial subjugation, then no, you don’t get yourself off the hook with “Relax, it’s just a fun board game!—a harmless, apolitical economic simulation that could have been set on Neptune for all I care. You need to take a chill pill.” And if as a designer you enable that, then no, you don’t get to hide behind a too-little-too-late exculpatory passage slapped onto a rulebook. Because if you actually stand by that intro, then you don’t design this game in the first place.

Mombasa’s perhaps well-intentioned, but actually quite creepy, box cover unwittingly ends up skewering the whole enterprise. The woman with a basket on her head, approaching the gamer (that’s you, with pith helmet at your elbow and quill rapidly tallying up that which you’ve snatched via despoilment, and for which you will subsequently be rewarded with victory points), is, yes, depicted with the utmost dignity. SHE is regally handsome and proud. SHE exudes a soulful independence. Meanwhile, there YOU are, looking out through the dim sockets of a corroded conscience.

I would so much rather be that woman in the middle ground. I, as a gamer, want only to benefit when *she* benefits. I want my clever strategy to pan out in *her* favor. Or, come to think of it, I want to *be* her. But we’re not that woman at all (she’s really only a plywood prop of an extra in the end, a dash of indigenous atmosphere). No, WE are the avaricious imperialist looking straight through and past her humanity, entirely disregarding her innate dignity as we quickly calculate how we might benefit from the contents of her basket.

And *that* is who you are in Mombasa, dear gamer. Contemptible. A petty tool of empire. A curdled soul. A sordid money-grubber. At best, a xenophobic twit. I am so disappointed in Alexander Pfister, whose flourishing oeuvre I otherwise have tremendous respect for. Wonderful designer and, from what I can tell, a wonderful man. But we really need our wonderful, gifted, and inspired game designers (and artists) to be repelled by such noxiousness, and to refuse to associate themselves with the morally bankrupt calculus of colonial mercantilism. To, instead, unequivocally condemn it by designing games in which the protagonist you represent is not out to propagate a crudely violative economic ideology, but rather to subvert said ideology, to undermine it, to rise above it—and to then be rewarded for doing so along the scoring track.

Indeed, what we need is for a thematic outlier like Spirit Island—in which designer R. Eric Reuss has bravely said enough is enough, I’m going to upend and lance the offhand, passive chauvinism and endemic amnesia of conventional settler-oriented board game narratives—to herald a shift toward a more enlightened, nuanced, and inclusive norm. For every Mombasa, we need ten Spirit Islands. For every Puerto Rico, we need ten more. We also need more and more board game geeks (my favorite people on the planet! emphatically good and sweet and sensitive and hyper-intelligent individuals!) to refuse to don that pith helmet—to reject collective, casual complicity in all of the above.

+

Lastly, and just for the record:

That an earlier thread on this subject was labeled “off topic” and then summarily shuttered sets a lamentable precedent. Off topic? Hardly. This stuff matters. The designer and publisher made a specific decision here, for which they should at least in theory be held accountable or, to begin with, made answerable to. Where better to articulate one’s legitimate objections to a game predicated on the ghastly premise of colonial profit than within that game’s ostensibly democratic forum?

Such debates might absolutely arise around the game table, after all, and so why shouldn’t similar discussions be given space to unfold here as well? Open Mombasa’s box and you are immediately confronted by its theme. If it’s in the box, then it’s fair game and relevant as can be. And unless admin is going to likewise proceed to shut down every thread in which a game’s theme is *praised* (off topic!), such slapdash and ham-handed “regulation” of the forums veers uncomfortably close to jittery censorship.

Here’s to inconvenient, uncomfortable relevance.

And here’s to Spirit Island, a game which I would respectfully suggest that the uber-talented Alexander Pfister study in great detail. You’re better than Mombasa, Alexander. I know you are. And I’m not referring to gameplay mechanisms.

If you agree with me, please say so. Thumbs just aren’t enough! Otherwise my unpopular viewpoint is about to get roundly pummeled."

Really cool, clever game. I'm very enamored with all of the recent hand-building games (Lewis and Clark, Concordia, Food Chain Magnate), this one probably being my favorite. The whole three stacks system gives it an extra dimension of decision-making and long term planning. And all of the mechanics feel well integrated. I love how the bookkeeping track requires careful planning to do really well on, and I like how many ways there are to advance the diamond track, and how that might pull you in the direction of one company over another. And the variability of which company ends up with which bonuses is really cool. I could keep going, I really like basically everything about this game.

RATING: 8
Mombasa ambitiously combines a number of Euro game mechanics into a cohesive whole while still introducing new ideas (particularly in hand management and deciding what cards to play on future turns and how to retrieve them for later use). The game's only significant issue is that with fewer players, it becomes less a mix of strategic planning and tactical maneuvering and more a brutal game of optimizing with random hidden information; but at its ideal player count, Mombasa is a unique game full of interesting actions to perform and decisions to make.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (July 2016)

In my mind, R&R Games only makes family/party games. They published my beloved Time´s Up (a Top Ten game for me) and Hanabi (which I also like). In their mission statement they say “our mission is to produce high-quality family board games so that we can play around all the time.” so it was strange to find a game of theirs that is, MOST definitely, not familiar. To be fair, they have also published Qin and Coal Baron but I haven’t played neither one of them so I don’t know if they are familiar games. Not that I’m complaining, I was (pleasantly) surprised when I played Mombasa and it is, arguably, the best game I have played in this year (I will do my favorite games of 2015 geeklist soon, and I’m pretty sure Mombasa will be among the best of the year).

Mombasa is a medium weight game in which you buy shares and manipulate the market to earn the most money. There is some area control as well.

The theme is boring for me, but the gameplay is excellent! In any case you don´t feel the theme through the game.

The game components are very well done. The game art is ok as well.

The rules of the game aren’t very complex, but there are many of them. You can explain them under 22 minutes. Playtime is around 3 hours.

Mombasa offers very tense and hard decisions. The planning phase is similar to Trickerion (another game I love). Each turn you need to choose (at least) 3 cards from your hand, but you won´t get back all three cards each turn, at most you will get one of them (along with other cards), so it is very interesting to plan ahead which cards you want to recover and when. Timing is very important. These cards are the available actions you can do in each turn and deciding which cards to choose isn’t obvious, in fact it is just the opposite. The game has very interesting decisions (which card to play?, where to play that card?, should I buy more cards?, should I expand the company? If so, which one?, should I advance in a particular company?, should I advance the diamond track? should I advance the bookkeeper track?, which book tile to take?) and you have very few resources and action spaces, so you can’t do all of them, although you want to. It is an exquisite pain and I love it! It seems there are multiple paths to victory.

The gameplay is deep and tense, a mistake can cost you the game.

There is plenty of player interaction. A player can undo your move and thus destroy the value of your shares, there are also temporal alliances to preserve the price of the shares. Analyzing and predicting you opponents’ moves is critical.

Mombasa has a high replay value. After you are familiar with the game, the companies´ track and the companies themselves will mix to form new available options. 

There is some luck in the way the cards appear and with the book tiles, but I feel luck can be controlled, so it doesn’t bother me in the least.

Bottom line, Mombasa is a very good Euro game and a keeper for me. I really like it and I can’t wait to play it again. It is not a family game but a gamer´s game and I was surprised by this because R&R Games forte are party games (or so I thought). Perhaps it can get an upgraded rating from me with more plays.

Finally got this to the table.  Plays 4 players well with the simultaneous action selection.  The task assignment system is pretty neat as is the stock mechanic.  It is a little on the meaner side as the game goes on - but even when displacing buildings the prior owner will get a new benefit when the building is replaced and it is just as easy to reclaim as it is to displace (this give and take in fact is a central game element). All in all a well-designed strategy game.

Only one play so far, but I was very impressed. Definitely need to play this again soon. 

The game just keeps getting better. Two players is good, but 4 players is amazing! 

After another 4 player game, I really am loving how difficult it is to figure out the best choices to make. The fact that the company values can be so volatile near the end of the game makes focusing on one company a little risky. At the same time, you want to invest in one company to get the company bonuses! Great game!

A year away from Mombasa had me questioning my love for it, but it was obvious halfway through my most recent play that this game has solidified a spot in my hall of fame games category. Excellent!

Takes a couple plays to break through the strategy and mechanisms, but once you're there Mombasa is awesome. Unlike Catan or Condordia, Mombasa allows players to pivot quickly if their immediate strategy is compromised. Having four companies to invest in (no matter the # of players) accommodates multiple playing styles and strategies, but without the feeling of being boxed in or out of options. 

After five plays, I'm seeing that the final score is always much closer than I think it'll be and the player that lays low and bides their time is often the winner. 

Overall, if you don't mind slogging through a dense rule book and getting past the brain-hurting planning phases, it's a high-reward game.

老實說混和機制只要調配得好，也不失成為一款經典的遊戲。Mombasa 對我來說就是這樣的一項作品，策略遊戲擔心的就是單一路線過於強大，而導致遊戲發展必須單調，Mombasa 很巧妙的安排各種路線的均一強弱，讓玩家玩過之後仍會意猶未盡的想嘗試走其他路線的可能性，當然，遊戲的目的還是賺得最多的分數。
以多種機制及路線的遊戲節奏來說，適度的掌握一兩種路線，遠比每種路線都參一腳會來得有效率，這是許多德式桌遊相同的特色，但是路線一旦跟其他人重疊，難免會發生棄車保帥的情形，這也是工人放置的窠臼，但Mombasa提供其他機制的選擇，讓遊戲變得發展性更高，在遊戲結束前誰都無法預測勝利屬於哪一家，隨時都有翻盤的機會。
我很喜歡這個遊戲，除了因為機制豐富路線多，最重要的是Mombasa 蒙巴薩不難，即使是第一次玩也能很快知道自己要做甚麼，也不太會有被海放的情形，上手門檻低而成就感高。感覺現在的遊戲越來越偏向這樣的設計趨勢，這也不啻是玩家的福音。

I played this once and taught it three times. The standout feature of Mombasa is the action selection mechanism. Each player begins the game with an identical deck of action cards. The first phase of each of the 7 rounds is planning, during which players choose 3 cards from their hand to use that round. It sounds simple, however, this action selection mechanism brings such delightful agony to your decisions because the cards you choose influence several key options:

1) Obviously, they determine which actions you can do.

2) Certain actions depend on which other cards you selected that round, and worse they depend on the order you perform your actions, so selection and sequencing are both important.

3) There are three discard piles for your action cards and you get to claim only one of these piles back each round. Therefore cards that work well together necessarily come back to you in a staggered fashion. Managing which cards end up on which discard pile is crucial to future planning.

4) You can unlock 1 or 2 additional slots to play action cards. The ability to use more action cards each round has benefits but also drawbacks. With extra slots you also have extra discard piles which widens the gap between the rate at which you play cards and the rate at which you reclaim them. 

[center][ImageID=2518984 medium][/center]

That mechanism alone makes this game fun and challenging to play, however everything else built around it has been polished to perfection. The other highlight for me is the potential for both positive and negative interaction in the expansion of the mining companies. Since players are free to invest in whichever companies they want, you may find your interests partially aligned with some of your opponents. This is nothing revolutionary in games with stock ownership, but the situation seems especially fluid in this game since companies' stock value depends on the number of trading posts they have on the map and this can swing quickly when company A places trading posts which at the same time remove trading posts belonging to company B.

Player turns are typically fast, and due to overlapping interests and a handful of limited action spots on the board you are generally interested in what other players are up to. There appear to be several areas to score points, but the win won't go to a player who mindlessly commits to one path, it will go to the player who remains flexible, is opportunistic, and savvy with her investments. I expect this to jump up to a 9 rating after a few more plays.

More complicated than I expected. Rules-wise its on a level with Terra Mystica. The first moves have players fumbling around, learning the ropes. Finding a way through the three principal point generators - investing in shares (tracks) and promoting them, gem dealing, order completion - is not easy and needs a strategy. Doing a little bit of everything is a sure way to lose. Concentrating on two of the four investment tracks is probably a good choice with pushing one of them massively, co-investing in another promising track. So is focusing on either gems or orders while tactically exploiting opportunities. 

A tough competitive game with three players, potentially mean with four. For a euro, the interaction on the map is surprisingly confrontational. While requiring non-neglectable effort to get into it, Mombasa is definitely worth it. Compared to the similarly complicated What's-Your-Game or Giochix games, I'm more confident that there's real depth, not just a full host of rules hiding shallow or irrelevant decision making behind lots of intertwined systems. How to build the deck of cards, preparing the redraw piles, planning the turn - each small decision can bring a definitive advantage or break a move. Planning ahead is not only rewarded but necessary.

A game that is focused on efficient use of an action-programming mechanism in combination with pushing up certain tracks.  There is a nice blend of area control and market speculation combined with a couple other tracks (mining, accounting/book).  Very solid game that doesn't overstay its welcome.  I can see how some might say the game ends just when you've finally got your efficient engine humming, but it is a game that leaves me with the feeling of wanting to get it back to the table again soon.  Also seems unique compared to other games in my collection, so it's a keeper.  Wish it could handle more than 4 players.

I’ve played this game 3 times, which is enough for me to know that I never want to play it again. Three times is not enough! you might say. Maybe not, but it’s 9 or 10 hours of my life that I’m not getting back.

This game sits at an awkward place. On the one hand its theme is the commercial exploitation of pre-colonial Africa. It therefore ventures, the uncomfortable throat-clearing in the rules excepted, without comment into a morally boggy wasteland. On the other hand, the theme - and particularly its setting in Africa - is almost entirely irrelevant, so it’s not obvious why this theme, rather than any other, was pasted on to its compendium of mechanics. 

Its link with Africa is not just tenuous, but absent - except that the board depicts an imaginary pre-colonial continent resembling Africa. It could have been a game about hamburger chains or automobile insurance. Bananas, coffee and cotton, the three commodities that are used as card art, have nothing to do with the game - any more than art depicting Brazilwood, tobacco and puma skins and a map of South America would have justified calling this game “São Luís”. 

So what is the reason for setting it in Africa? I can’t even offer the “scramble for Africa”, because there’s no hint of competition between the British, French, Germans and other European powers for overseas territory. And frankly, the scramble for Africa was driven by ideology more than by the lure of lucre, so even the competing companies make little historical sense.

Not only is the pre-colonial trading company theme pasted uncertainly over the mechanisms, but it is not clear to me what the player incarnates in this game. The 4 chartered companies are independent of the players, or rather, the players can invest in any or all of them. But the player is not merely a stock-holder, since you make decisions about when and where the company will expand - and whether, in that expansion, it will conflict with other companies. But more fundamentally, the player’s decisions, where choices sometimes influence later choices but sometimes stand alone, comprise a strange hotchpotch and fail to identify a consistent actor:

. Buy resources - which apparently places you at the helm of a company, but no, because the resource you buy might later be used to further the interests of any of the companies, might even be used in a way that has nothing to do with any of the companies;

. Increase your investment in one of the companies - which clearly makes you an investor;

. Cause one of the companies to expand its influence in Africa - in this case you are obviously, but only temporarily, the board of governors of one of the companies;

. Do something that can’t be explained thematically involving what the game calls bookkeeping, but might conceivably have been more thematically relevant if it were relabelled warehouse operations, or shipping clerk, or operations management, or even European Settlement Board. As “bookkeeper” your point of view is perhaps that of an accountant working for a shareholder, but it is not clear how this activity relates to the theme.   

. Do something involving diamonds that seems completely unrelated to the theme, and for which the actor is apparently some random individual interacting with a diamond merchant;

. Do something that allows you to collect a variety of things or do a variety of stuff, in few or none of which activities the actor is identified.

The inconsistent point of view prohibits me from getting any emotional contact with the game. I’m just sitting at the table collecting points in a variety of ways, some of which are related to one another. That distance strongly limits my engagement - and confuses me.

But worse is to come - my sense, admittedly after only three laborious games, is that this is largely a multi-player solitaire. The interaction between players is as solid as mist. Yes, you can buy a card I had my eye on, and yes, you can reduce the cost of shares of a company that I have invested in, but I seem to be able to do very little to interact with your strategy and counter it. I’m solving a set of scarcely-interlocking puzzles, and so are you, and who does it best? 

It may be simply that I don’t understand the game yet, but the very idea of a strategy seems a little far-fetched. Instead, I have a set of possible benefits to strive for on various different areas of the board, and you may help or hinder me, but I can probably largely discount that in my earnest attempt to add up possible points.

The game turns around deck building. The deck you play determines how other mechanics play out - the most intriguing of which is an ingenious stock market that drives and is driven by a subsidiary struggle for area control, the least convincing of which is a play-and-move trek into dusty hinterlands (the diamonds track), and somewhere between those is a build-first, move-later-if-you-have-the-right-cards (bookkeeping) track.

The deck building mechanic is fiendishly complicated, in that you slowly set up not one but three discard piles, one of which you take into your hand at the end of each round. The complication comes in planning your play so that the discards in one of those piles come available to you at exactly the right moment, two or three rounds later, when the board configuration is just so - you hope.

The investment mechanic is nicely thought out and executed. The more you invest, the closer you are to winning the game, but only if your company’s shares are worth something. The worth of the shares comes as a stock of pieces is evacuated to invade spaces on the board, but the worth may go back down if those pieces are returned to stock as another company moves into those same spaces on the board. A variety of bonuses come to you as you increase your investment, but I felt that this was a bell (or perhaps a whistle) that didn’t add much to the flavour of the game.

So what’s it like to play?

To be fair, I think it’s too early for me to say. I think anyone’s first few games of Mombasa will feel like a ramble in Kenya’s Aberdare mountains in heavy fog. Constant confusion, struggling through rugged vegetation, stumbling over tussocks and into bogs, lack of sense of direction, and no destination in sight. Gradually the fog will lift, but even at the end of the game, you’ll probably lack much clarity about how you might have played it better. Though unlike a stumble through the Aberdares, you probably won’t encounter elephants.

Even so, this is definitely not a game for the casual gamer. 

I have given this game away to friends who enjoy it. Because, yes, other people I've played it with do indeed enjoy it. The complications of the game draw them in rather than putting them off. But if they offer to play it with me, I will try to persuade them to bring Imperial to the table instead.

I didn't like any of the various parts that make up this game except maybe for the artwork.  The discarding of cards into three stacks for future use seemed clumsy with the results being frustrating.  I was also not crazy about the area-control mechanism in the central part of the board.  Overall, the exercise of acquiring different cards and combining them to useful and efficient actions later in the game was just not inspiring.

I'd play this game again if others really wanted to but I really have no desire to attempt another play again.  In fairness, the game instruction for my one play wasn't absorbed well by my brain but again, I really saw nothing that gave me the desire to try again.  GWT by this designer is much better by far.

Some may think the theme is questionable, but it is accurate if nothing else. I guess I'm just a horrible person, as I totally get into the investor aspect of this, playing the different companies off of one another and using their power to further my aims. Awesome action programming and selection game. The bonus markers in this one have some cool interactions with the timing of majorities. The different company tracks with variable powers are excellent. The bookkeeping aspect is excellent. The card display and building future hands mechanic is excellent. This game is excellent.

Essen 15 after the show musthave 

Boy . Am I glad I got this. The  bonus actions majority plays coupled with the purchasing and the bookmarket offer great choices.

I am totally lost on the theme however but because there were so many options available it wasn't a problem.

In most games I am able to start to play efficient after a couple of rounds. I am not sure I will be able to do that with this game.  It is a snowballing game and when you catch up speed the game ends. 

That is fine with me. In the first couple of rounds it is easier to predict in which things you can get majority.  
Probably my main concern is that everybody needs to understand that being a startplayer is really important. 
Myself and the player to my left understood it despite me clearly adding that to the explantion of the game.

So in the end it came as no surprise that we came in first and second. And because he was on my left . He won.

I really liked the exploration phase.  The valuation of shares is utterly brilliant.

Excellent game! It's definitely heavy since you can plan ahead a lot but ruleswise it's fairly average (and rules are well written). Replayability seems good since there are many paths to follow and other players' actions will force you to adapt to new strategies. Good amount of euro-interaction, nothing mean. 
I did not like that the book tiles were so small. Furthermore, Mombasa can take a long time to finish - first rounds go rather quick but near the end you have more actions and cards to choose from and this can cause AP.

Uh. It's a well-developed, well-made complex eurogame with interesting mechanism elements interacting in an interesting way. Also, it has lots of ideas that I like, especially the central mechanism of using and reusing the cards. However, I found this mechanism hard (for me) to master in itself, so probably I would have enjoyed the original advanced family game it was developed from more. 
Simply put, there is just too much going on and to focus on, and I just felt I can't. Maybe it's because I'm getting older, and probably I would do better in subsequent plays, but it's just not fun to find out how you've screwn up something again and again during the game - which is also a rather long game for what it offers. Also unlike in good Knizia and Kramer games where you feel you would need one action more in each round, here I just felt I would need 3 action more each round, which is not necessarily bad but once again felt painful. Also right now it seems hoarding movement cards for the last round is something maybe a bit too strong but after one play I can't tell.
All in all, I like lots of stuff in this game and I certainly didn't hate what I was doing but my brain burned, well, more like melted down and this didn't feel fun enough in the end. So while I think complexity addicts are going to love this game, I just felt I would have enjoyed the original complexity of the Africa 1830 prototype way more.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS:

Excellent game after first blush - enjoyed it quite a bit. There's quite a few interesting interacting mechanics and being aware of building a future deck so to speak can be a daunting task. This is definitely a stock game but pursues it in a different manner than many games. Area majority is used to determine the value of the stock as it is uncovered and placed on the board where one takes bonus actions and the quantity is determined by pushing your marker along a column this can be done in several different ways but also vies with other options such as purchasing additional action cards which may also increase your stock by one. Looking forward to playing this one more.

Very good Eurogame with neat mechanics and VP Collectors. Playing smart is one of the most important things in this game. You have to make clever use of your actions like in other games, but have a close look to opponents actions as well to decide if you cooperate or compete with them. In this way its close to Terra Mystica for me and so it gets one of my favorites. You like easy to learn complex economy games? Buy it!

Quello che però non capisco è il perchè sia stato reso (secondo me) inutilmente complicato da mille paletti, regolette, limitazioni: penso che sarebbe un eccellente gioco con una variante meno complessa. Così com'è, è adatto solamente a giocatori esperti, ma che sono costretti a giocare regolamento alla mano per i mille dubbi che emergono giocando.

I immediately liked this game even before playing it.  It is a stock game with a resource management component and worker placement.  You try and purchase various resources and cards in the market that provide actions or stock.  The actions can advance you on various stock tracks and each track provides a special ability.  Lastly there is a "book" track and a diamond track.  Lastly there is a map of Africa where you are trying to deploy trading posts that expand the value of each stock.  At the end of the game you score points for each money you have leftover and the stock.  

This game is great and may actually crack my top ten.  It is definitely in my top twenty.

I'm having a bit of a love/hate thing with [b][thing=172386][/thing][/b].  Make no mistake, it's a solid Euro.  Except that the two-player game seems to come down to who has the most diamonds.  I like that it's an economic Euro.  Except it's not.  It's an action selection game with some deck-building.  Or a deck-building game with some action selection.  With special powers.  Sure you buy shares in companies and the companies divide up Africa for exploitation, but as valuable as those companies and their shares may get, they also give players special powers.  Which is cool, but thematically not thematic at all.  When I'm playing, it doesn't bother me that, for example, the Mombasa Company allows me to trash a card for a profit.  But when I think about it (like now), it makes no thematic sense at all.  And it bugs me.

Almost a great game, but for me it didn't work. Specifically, players can target your territory with devastating effects on your score. Yes, smart players will target the leader, but that just did not happen. The guy in last place decided to go for all exploration on the last two turns, and I happened to be the target. Otherwise, it was a cool game with interesting mechanics concerning the different colonial companies.

First impressions:
-Rulebook feels a bit verbose.  Hesitant to teach and play this since it felt like there were a lot of little rules I may miss.  
-Lots of moving parts that interact in different ways so this will take a little play time to get a good feel for how the game works.  May not be obvious at first what you need to do to win.
-Need to be able to plan a round or two in advance.
-Quite a bit of interactivity between players.
-Unsure of longevity.

The game felt much simpler and straightforward about 3/4 of the way through my first game.  The actual flow of the game is simple, but the rulebook made it feel much more overwhelming than it actually was.  

I feel like this is a game that won't be good for people that can only play sporadically.  There's a lot of interconnected mechanisms that will make it difficult to play well, if you're not fairly familiar with the game.  Just enough tiny little rules that will make this a little annoying to try to recall them all after some time away from the game.  

I'm a little picky when it comes to medium-heavy strategy games.  They tend to be games that benefit from frequent repeated plays.  I typically don't enjoy the first play of heavier games very much since it's more about getting a feel for the game's rules and how the mechanisms interact than learning the strategy of the game.  So, I like to keep only a handful in my collection at a time since I hate relearning games after an extended stretch away from them.  Rather be playing something new at that point.  I'm unsure after my first few plays if this is a keeper.  The first play was just ok, as to be expected with this type of game.  2nd game was very enjoyable to play, but I don't think it's a top medium-heavy game for me yet.  I have a feeling it may start to be a bit too samey after 10-15 plays.  I prefer to get more plays out of a game, especially ones that require more thinking to play - due to strategy or rules.

Update Feb 2017: I had a good time during my first handful of plays, but I just can't make myself play this anymore.    I've even gone as far as pulling it off the shelf to play, started to open it, and changed my mind.  Back on the shelf it went.  Not the kind of medium-heavy game I'm looking for.

Mombasa ... Mombasa ... Mombasa, where to start. Even though I only played this twice last year this game is right up there with my favourites. It's a beast of many faces, easy to learn, yet hard to have even the slightest clue what you are actually planning to do in two rounds time, and then when you get there you realise you no longer want to do it! 

I don't play a lot of stock manipulation games but I guess this could fall into that category although it is definitely way on the euro side on the scale of stock games. The game play seems to be an amalgamation of just about every game ever invented before with the dastardly topping of each player having 3 active card slots (which increases up to 5 if you are mental enough to open them up ... beware this leads to prolonged umming and ahhing at the start of each turn and may annoy gamers in your immediate vicinity) that then subsequently at the end of the round will transfer to 3 separate discard piles (or up to 5 if you ignored my earlier warning), of which you only return 1 to your hand each turn before the cards you just used are transferred. Genius!

Yes it's genius, genius that you will be cursing at the start of every one of the games 7 rounds. Just as the cards align so you can carry out your masterplan, they dissolve and spread in the ether requiring logistical and strategical planning far beyond my realm to get them all back to where I want them by anywhere useful in the timeline of the game. Bugger!

I won't go into the rules and complete round gameplay but it is an extremely satisfying experience, some parts more than others. That is if you are an accountant. If you aren't, avoid the book keeping track. The temptation here is to constantly keep trying to move up, whereas from my couple of plays I have realised the game rewards you for using broad strokes, a bit like Kandinsky's early work formed from a long period of development and maturation, try and move up the track a fair way in one go, collect books of a similar ilk and there is a reason you can pay 2 coins to ignore a book. Use it. But this is all obvious advice doing it in game is delightful and rewarding (literally you get a reward from the last book you land on as opposed to the diamond track) but again I can only presume this as, as I mentioned, it requires logistical and strategical planning far beyond my realm.

We did play one rule wrongly, but for some reason I can't imagine playing the game correctly would be better. We played you can only place on the goods/exploration worker placement majority spots if you alone have the majority, not as in the rules, if you are tied for the majority. This for me gave a delightful aspect of the game where you were often facing off with another player seeing who would pull out and use their ... say, banana's, first giving the other the majority. This gave another tension to the game that avoided what would be just a straight rush to these spots if it was just a matter of whom amoungst the tied players was first in turn order.

Brilliant game. Highly enjoyable. Not as heavy as many have led you to believe. Try it, would possibly be my game of the year if I had had a chance to play it more.

Keeper.

(4/17) 9. A really thinky, really great economic game with a really unique card refresh mechanism.  There's so much going on here with the worker placement, action selection, card buying, "tech tree" in the form of moving along the different company tracks...not to mention the quasi area control of the African continent itself.  Really, really enjoyed my first play and excited to try it out again.

(10/17) Drop to 8.  This is probably purely because I haven't had a chance to play it in a while, but now that I have my own copy I'm looking forward to getting this back to the table and having this number rise again.

Mombasa is an excellent game. If you are looking for a heavy game that rewards multiple plays this is a keeper. However, my group prefers lighter and shorter games.

Pros:
-Multiple mechanisms that work cohesively
-Clever hand building 
-Multiple strategies

Cons:
-A tad fiddly (pieces are small)
-Component quality is average
-Overwhelming with choices  
-Long (3 hrs)

This is one of those games where there is inherent satisfaction is pursuing different strategies. I appreciate that the player interaction is not solely "I'm earlier in the turn order, so I'll block you from the action you need." The rulebook is one of the best I've read for a game of this complexity.

Hmmm...not really sure how I feel about it yet. It's definitely a point salad. The mechanics mesh together quite well. Like Vital Lacerda games--it feels like it ends before you get your engine is in full throttle. My initial impression is positive based on the solid design, great components and bold theme. I could see this rating going up after a few more plays.

Preliminary rating. I obsessed over the puzzle aspect of the book track in my first two games to the detriment of paying attention to what my opponents were doing. My next play should help to solidify my rating.

In general, it does seem that the book track is underpowered. I had to grind to get 40 points from it, while getting 40 in diamonds. I also did fairly well in a company track (54 points, while my opponents had only a few points). However, I still lost because my friend got 120 from a single company. Hence, if you are going for a diamond/bookkeeping win you need to just go along for the ride in the dominant company, getting at least a few shares. Alternatively, you can try to keep the company values balanced by lowering that company's value. This doesn't seem as feasible as just going along for the ride, except perhaps in a 4-player game, in which multiple players can use exploring points to gang up on that company.

Incidentally, in that game the Mombasa track had the perk of +1/+2 exploring points, plus Mombasa has the worker placement slot for maximum explorers, so they really worked well together. I should have realized that track would be dominant and failed to do so.

The multiple discard pile mechanic is new and innovative and I expect to see it used to greater effect in a more high speed, less brain burning game in the future.

A couple plays in, and I still really like this game but I do think it is at risk of mistaking complexity for depth. Long setup and long rules explanation don't help me get this to the table often.

Great card management via a very smart system. Lots of stuff that I like. First game took 3 hours, that is the only big minus so far. We should bring that back to 2 hours.

The synergy in this game between your actions, where you move on the board, the stock-markets and your goals is pretty special. There seems to be a lot of different ways to go about this game. You can take risks in the markets and earn bonus actions and money. You can try to work the diamond mines or go all in on books. Without a doubt hand-management is very important -- you discard your action cards to your personal stacks and then choose one of those stacks to go back into your hand. Seems like a brain-burner but it all comes together so nicely.

I really liked this one! It's only one play but I liked everything about it... the way you play the cards to different slots, than you do the actions in the order you want and can be done... then you pick up one of the piles of previous played action cards to be available for you next round...

this is a really strategic game, you can plan 2, 3 or even 4 rounds ahead... the decision on where to place the cards is crucial and it's a fantastic mechanism that forces the players to make some hard choices!

The art of the game is pretty great too and the quality of the components is excellent...

It's all praises for this one, glad to own it and it will be played again soon!

Mombasa is an interesting point-salad horizontal euro - it's not heavy, but it seems like a good gateway into heavy euros.  I really like the look of the game.  The graphic design is intuitive and easy to understand.  The game offers opportunities to interact both positively and negatively.  It reminds of Zhanguo with some of that games rough edges smoothed away into a blander, more mundane, more mainstream package. (The theme here is actually offensive, but it's not in your face when you're playing the game.  While playing I didn't feel like the game had anything to do with Africa.)

Some really cool mechanics here, but ... there are to many and some of them empty of meaning. 
The game seems artificially complex, like someone added a lot of stuff to an elegant simple design and removed the fun and strategy.
Mombasa creates the illusion of several paths to victory, in fact while you are entertained with your solitaire forced planning, your decisions seem to decrease in value as the game progresses, and you realize everything is worth 1 point.

Hard to rate because (1) I found it fascinating on my one playthrough--the card-management dynamics in particular present some unusual challenges; (2) despite the weak nod to historical context in the rulebook, basically there's no way of getting around the fact that this is a game about making money from the colonial exploitation of Africa--I don't enjoy becoming a colonialist diamond tycoon or coffee and banana producer; (3) the bookkeeping track is really opaque to new players.

I'm hoping Pfister revises this someday and changes the theme/setting. I'm glad he moved on to the rather more graspable Great Western Trail, on the far more palatable theme of the development of the American West.... uh... hang on a moment.... :S

With this game, I've reached the zeitgeist of how many or few arbitrary mechanisms I can stand in a game just for complexity's sake. Everything works, but it throws away even the thinnest of thematic ties in favor of being very calculable. The amount of planning to even be able to do rudimentary actions like purchasing in a subsequent round are exhausting unless you enjoy calculation for calculation's sake. I enjoy heavy euros, but this one makes me feel like I'm spinning my wheels the entire game.

Another mediocre game from Alexander Pfister. I'm beginning to think that this designer just isn't for me. All Mombasa is, is an action selection game using cards where you can't ever do as much as you'd like to do. There's some interest in customizing your hand of cards and the piles you create, but otherwise you're just going up on various tracks to try and score points. That's it. The theme could have literally been anything.

There are four companies on the board, and players try to acquire shares, diamonds or books. The prime mechanic is deck building, where your played cards are shifted into an upper row, and you recover one column from the upper row. You can gain more cards to play by advancing a certain distance on diamonds or books. Other mechanics include advancing the companies to get shares, or diamonds, and there is a tactical element as well. There is also a worker placement mechanic where each player has 2 workers and you place them on the board to give you benefits. 

I do enjoy the game since there is a lot to think about. You want to have shares in the right company, and not be alone, otherwise the company will suffer. You want to advance along the diamond and book tracks, and you want to use the benefits of the share track. My rating will likely rise after more plays. I am enjoying the plays so far and hope to play at least a few more times. There is tension in there are cards you don't want opponents to get, but you have to balance off what you want to do.

First impressions: Point salad done well and original "deck building".
Love these mechanisms:
- recovery of cards. This is what makes the game heavier than expected. For me comparable to Trajan style, you need to solve a puzzle to perform the actions you want in an efficient way.
- deck-building. Different to other deck-building games, old strategy of engine building through trimming your deck does not work, since you run out of cards easily once you get new card slots (actions, which you need to work hard for).
- Interaction between players. Competition for actions, majorities and map control.
- I expect that with more plays more combo opportunities through sinergy of different company bonus will appear.

Meh:
- Although I think this game rewards long term thinking, I feel that the way to reach your goals is too opaque (hopefully it will become clearer with more plays)
- highly AP prone, due to the puzzling actions.

After more plays and with random tracks this game is really fun and tense

Great game, a lot of choices to make - either invest in one of the company from the begining or wait until one will be developed by someone else. Also invest in diamonds or in bookkeeping to get another spot to play more cards .. Different variations of marker tracking with different additional actions increases game replayability.
In one word - awsome game, there is no wining tactic really - not that I spoted in 4 games I played. There were all very different between eachother.

Need another play to decide how much of this game is just the luck of the starting tile and how well it matches the other starting tiles and stock tracks.

The art is just average, except the splendid box cover. The rest of the components are fine, but my copy came with quite a few trade posts that have different odd shapes.

It's a serious eurogame that combines many mechanics: action selection, deck building, a bit of majorities, area control, set collection, etc. You are supposed to combo all of them to get the best results. The mechanism that stands out is the retrieval of the action cards by groups. It's one of those games where you want to do many, many more things than you actually can.

It's not a slow game, but the first turns are lilely to be slower, until people gets a clear view of what their goals for thegame will be. Anyways, it's never going to be a fast game. Randomness is a factor, because although you can anticipate some of the actions of the other players, it's difficult to know what cards are they going to play (they might "steal" the majorities you want), or even what cards will they buy.

I have liked it, but not loved, as I expected. The reason for that is that up to now, the winning strategies are those who focus in a single company, and that was precisely what I expected to avoid with this game.

RATING: 8
Amazingly fascinating. 

Very complex and thinky, but so well polished that everything runs smoothly all the time: The only sources of points are money, shares, and player board tracks but how you gain and improve those is an entirely different matter. Similarly, there are lots of options to choose from on a round but actually taking the actions is very simple: just spend a token or some of your 3-5 cards. And the maintenance overhead between rounds is extremely low.

Massive amount of constant planning: Timing within a round is crucial, so you need to calculate nearly all of your actions for the round in advance. At the same time, you always need to plan for 1-2 future rounds because of both the devious hand management scheme and the book track engine.

The engine building puzzle is really impressive: How to buy, trash, and cycle cards while trying to get the cards to match your book track, and at the same time also trying to benefit from company track bonuses, company expansion, and share price manipulation.

So, it is very thinky and long but runs smoothly and does not feel that long with three players. Probably not suitable for four players though, unless they are very experienced with the game.

Rispetto alla maggior parte degli amici, il gioco non mi ha rapito. Si tratta di un tipico german di questo periodo, materiali e grafica standard e gioco che ha nella fase azionaria la principale originalità. A parte questo il gioco mi ricorda un Feld per la distribuzione esagerata di punti. La mancanza di aderenza con l'ambientazione, la poca possibilità di capire chi stia vincendo e l'alta aspettativa probabilmente sono gli aspetti che hanno fatto si che il gioco mi scivolasse via abbastanza indifferente.

RATING: 5
This one is perhaps a more mature design without the immediate appeal of most of Pfister's games. The shareholding aspect feels very influenced by Arkadia, but the assorted Euro frippery that surrounds it is rather fiddly and doesn't really add a lot. I would have liked to see something much more focussed on the central mechanic.

An excellent economy game. Presenting the players with a lot of meaningful choice and a lovely degree of brain-burn that is thrilling but not exhausting. Right up there with the likes of Archipelago, Brass, Automobile or Indonesia. For me this game really lived up to its hype.

I thought I was doing better in this game than I actually was doing, which might be a credit to the design of the game, right? I was having so much fun, I didn't even bother to see how bad I was doing! This game of area control, hand management, tile placement, market speculation has a lot of mechanics and could tempt people into groan-inducing AP. But thanks to an uncluttered board and a flawless rule book, Mombasa is more fun than you thought colonialism would be! Thematically, does the card drafting and other mechanics feel atmospheric and real to the experience? Maybe not, but it was such a slick-designed game, I never even noticed! Definitely one of the favorites I've played this year!

I love it.  It's a wonderful heavy Euro.  I will compare it to my other favorite Eurogame - Trajan.  It's just as complex - maybe even having a little more moving parts. It's just as great.  Trajan is more tactical every turn.  Mombasa has a little more long-term goal planning.  I love the way you can set your deck up for future turns.  it kinda reminds me of the mancala feature of Trajan. And as for the people giving this a 1-rating based on the theme.....why would you get the game if you knew what the theme was and that you would find it offensive?

Waaaaah! Awesome game once again! I really like how everything works seamlessly! Fantastic game again by Eggert. I love the games they select for their catalogue (a few minor bumps along the road). Mombasa is currently a highlight out of Essen 2015. I can't even imagine how much work went into this project. Beautiful game design.

I like how functional everything is. Beautiful game and can't wait to play again!

Very enjoyable. Action track and re-using one of three discard piles is brilliant. Many interesting decisions to make, and turns go fast. Works well with two, managed to get three companies going, though the third one just barely. 

Book track takes a while to learn properly. Had first three player game and it was more intense than with two.  There always seems to be a battle to rent the diamond merchant card.  You absolutely need to work on your diamond and book tracks to win.

My wife is picky and she enjoyed this more than snowdonia, myrmes, orleans, trajan, gold west, shipyard, rococo. We actually finished the game in one sitting.

Update: not interested in further plays. Bookkeeping track really unpleasant, fiddly, unneccessary. Needs more than two players as well, and that rarely happens. We enjoy Pfister's port royale more. Update: also sold port royal. Pfisfer is overated.  Played  all his games, owned all his games, sold all his games.

I knew already at the rules explanation when I tried this in Essen that it was my kind of game. One full game with four players confirms my first impression.

I've played this a few more times now and it's still a really good game. The randomised setup makes a great variation in gameplay, but it may also unbalance the game slightly.

Mombasa is a hand management game in which you a number of cards at the same time into different piles, and you retrieve a pile of played cards each turn for future play. You can also buy new cards and trash cards--it felt a little like a multifaceted Concordia or Rococo. The board play is pretty interesting as well; you're expanding four competing companies into Africa to gain various bonuses, as well as using a number of worker placement actions. These bonuses advance you on tracks that open up new card piles and provide lots of end-game points. Finally, you can also advance up each company's stock track, which open up extra worker placement spots or provide extra workers, and also grant end-game multipliers based on how well that company has expanded. Despite the many disparate elements, the game actually ties together very well, though there is a little of order-of-operations trickiness to work through. I was really impressed by this game, as it just provides a multitude of different options yet all flows together very well. This could become a new favorite.

A brilliantly simple game yet it seems to have some depth between trying out a couple different tracks or investing in companies. I'm not sure how deep the game is, but it does present you with a swath of options to choose from. 2 player seemed to play fine although I feel like this is probably much more interesting with 3-4 players.

Update: Much better with 4 players although 2 is still quite fun. I keep hearing the bookkeeping track is weak, but I'm unsure of it. I feel like if you really want to make it far, you need to buy either a lot of the same/similar A/B tiles or pay extra book points and get a bunch of C tiles. C seems to be the easiest to achieve surprisingly.

When I first started to play the game it seemed like it would have a great mix of mechanisms that would really be up my alley.  I went for a strategy where I tried to really maximize my card power and action selecting ability while focusing heavily on the 'stock' aspect of the game.  Another player did the same.  2 other players focused soley on the player board tracks.  One for diamond the other for books.  Each maximized their respective board and largely ignored the main market and area control board.  They both tied for the lead, 20+ points ahead of the players that focused on the stocks and card action ability.  I feel this makes the game have really only 1 avenue to win.  Interesting card play, unpleasant game.

RATING: 6
Rating based on 1 3-player game, which is clearly NOT the ideal number to play this game with. If 2 players find eachother in expanding a company, there's nothing you can do and if you end up with worthless shares, you will 100% lose. 
However I can see the quality of this game, but I believe 4 will be the only good number to play this game with.

Edit 29/11/2015: played a second game with 4 players. Still not convinced of this game. If you're (one of)the player(s) missing out on the track from whom the company is expanded like hell, you're sure to lose. I knew that it was pointless to try and boost a company on my own from previous game, so I bought almost every card with a share of that company on. But even with a maximized diamond-track I was till 30 points behind the player who had 9 shares of the Cairo-company who was worth 11 gold/share. It's simply impossible to compensate. Therefore I lowered my rating by 1 (7 -> 6)

I really enjoyed this game. I especially enjoyed the card system and planning for the retrieval of the cards each round. Very interesting and clever. 

Medium-heavy game probably best with 4p since I played 3p and found it would likely be better with a 4th to maybe keep things even. hard to say. Need to play it a few more times. I am liking what I played and look forward to playing it more.

This is a stock market game, where there are four companies working to harvest africa of it's natural resources. Players buy stocks and the value of those stocks depends on how well those companies are doing on the board at any given moment. Unlike many of these types of games, who has which stocks is public knowledge which means you are always gauging how much your actions help you vs how much they help your opponents. Players also have two valuable tracks on their player boards, but for the most part focusing on those means you don't have the time to invest into the companies that you'd want. There are multiple paths to victory, and every decision you make is meaningful, from the order of your actions down to which of your three discard piles you send each card to.

Thank goodness I played before I bought!  This game is not terrible, but like everyone says, there are just too many mechanics mixed up in one game.  Buying cards and/or stocks with bananas seems stupid.  Expand your empire and gain books?  I get majority if I happen to flip over more bananas than you?  It all seems so stupid.  The card management aspect is this game's only redeeming quality.

Trajan is much better on all accounts.  Play Trajan instead!

First play was with 2 players, and we really enjoyed it. Second play was with 3 players, and it blew the first play away. Adding a 3rd or 4th player makes it a much different game with more tension and dynamic gameplay. As I said, my friend and I both had a great time with 2 players, but neither he nor I would want to play it again with fewer than 3 just because of how much better it played. Super solid game, and it feels entirely different than anything else I've ever played.

Played once, hope to play again.  Certainly seems like a game that is embarrassed by its central mechanic, and so has dressed it self up in several auxiliary systems that are clunky and considerably less entertaining..

Slow deck building, set collection, hand menagment, some stock market, all mixed into this beautiful game. Number of rules may be overwhelming at first but after only few turns you can handle what is going on. I just hope there is as much replayability as it seems to keep it as interesting as it is.

21.11.2017 - after 11 plays with various player counts

I love this game. Mombasa & GWT easily made Alexander Pfister my favorite designer of all time.
This is a very thight game. It has a heap of different mechanics (worker placement, card drafting, area controll, variable setup elements, advance planning, etc.) but the combination of these is perfect. Plus there are some new one: the bookkeeping is phantastic, and the way you develop / play / recycle your deck is VERY-VERY clever. 
But the tried and true mechanics from other games also got a facelift here with some small modifications: 
- all worker placement has an important tempo element, but here it is even more relevant: is it worth to get that bonus for a certain commodity majority while risking a card that could be very valuable for you (but for other players, too)? Should you attack first, so that you get controll over territories which makes the conquering of these territories for your opponent more costly? Of course, but doing so you ALWAYS forfeit other possibilities which could bite you back later on.
The card drafting / advance planning part is very clever. Basically a part of your turn is defined by the innitially three cards you play in your planning phase. But it does matter, in which columns you play these cards, and of course it matters, when and in what combination you play them. And adding new cards to your hand from the available options makes you more flexible, but the options are aplenty, and it is difficult to decide between them. It is a puzzle in itself to figure out what and how you would like to do in your next turn, and when you succeed, it is a very rewarding feeling. 
Also, the modular powers makes every game different and already at the beginning you have to decide, which starting tile you choose based on these powers' place and the layout of the initial card selection plus the bookkeeping tiles. 
Did I mention the bookkeeping? It is maybe the most difficult part of the game, but it could be very rewarding if after careful planning in one go you advence 10 steps in the bookkeeping track!
In one respect the game reminds me of Imperial. You DON'T controll the chartered companies themselves, you controll enterpreneurs whose only purpose is maximizing their profit. This means that at the beginning of a game there is always jockeying for position and this could generate a lot of tension, too.
WONDERFUL-WONDERFUL DESIGN, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!

This was my surprise hit of 2015. I love the shared company area control. Since no one actually owns a company, the game never feels terribly cutthroat and there is always opportunity to grow. Cards can be used for a plethora of different actions, such as buying new cards, expanding company territory, increasing stocks, digging for diamonds, or collecting books. There is no one winning strategy here, but rather, a good strategy will emerge from everyone's combined efforts. It's basically a point salad, but the value of each action is ever-changing. This is stock-holding at its finest. I hope an expansion adds more company boards.

[u]The Positive:[/u]
(+) The art is not 'great', but it sure is very functional. It supports in understanding the game. Moreover, the components are of good quality (except an unfortunate misprint of some 1$-coins in which some are smaller than others)

(+) The game rules are very structured and limited. This elegant rule set makes the game easy to explain and understand.

(+) Notwithstanding the limited and easy rules make the game easily accessible, this game offers a huge amount of stuff to wrap your head around. Due to the intertwined mechanisms, there are often many ways to try to get things done, but they all require a very precise execution. The action system with the card piles effectivily forces players to rethink their strategies constantly as they have to split a winning combination of action cards after just one use. This makes that players are constantly planning many *many* turns ahead.

(+) The game feels really balanced as it will challenge each and every player no matter what path to victory they try to follow. I feel all important strategies to score many points are hard to pull off and even more so if they reap benefits along the way. This also means the game will keep all players down: no runaway leader problem here. [i]For example: You would like to aquire many shares of a company and pump up its value? Good idea! This strategy alone might score you about 100 points when executed really well and will earn you significant benefits along the way. All you need to do is -> First get lots of shares. You will need good-cards for that. Getting these cards requires other goods-cards you won't be able to use to buy the shares you want. So you will have to prioritize (unless of course you snatch away the right actionspot on the board with a worker in order to obtain extra shares without spending the good-cards in your action display, which you really should ;) ). If you overcame this problem, you are faced with the next one: Yay, you have interesting goods and you have built up your shares but... Now you need exploration cards in order to get those trading posts out! Good luck with that! Similar examples could be given for the game making life hard on players who try to get their bookkeeping track up, but when executed really well this path will also reward them in a variety of ways.[/i]

(+) Many different (very challenging!) paths to victory. Along the way, due to its intertwined mechanisms, the game will seduce you with really nice opportunities to stray from your path. Sometimes you should follow up on these, other times they should be avoided. It would take quite some insight into this game in order to assess correctly which is which.

(+) Thanks to the fact that all four companies come with 2 different sets of abilities and the order in which the companies can be placed around the game board, the game can get set up in many different ways, ensuring a high replayability.

(+) Due to the 'controlled' way the action card deck gets shuffled and put together, the game 'grows' in an interesting and correct way. 

(+) Little to no luck dependence (only in distributing the starting tiles, in a minor extent (can be mitigated by clever placement) the drawing of book tiles and the order by which the action cards become available for sale (but this shouldn't lead to significant imbalances as the draw deck gets composed in a controlled way during set-up)). 

(+) Player interaction sure is present. You prioritize your actions by assessing what the others will probably first go after. Doing so incorrectly could have serious consequences for your greater plan. Furthermore there is direct player interaction during exploration, increasing the value of a company while decreasing the value of others. This mainly happens in the second half of the game.

[u]The Negative:[/u]
(-) This game really deceives first time players. Based on its cover, its name and learning the rules, when going in, most will think of this as a medium weight game. Soon they will realise they are in for a mind crushing experience in which one critical mistake in their planning (which must in detail span so many turns ahead!) might cost them *tons* of points. Although the rules are very accessible, the game in itself sure isn't. Know with whom you start this adventure!

(-) Downtime/Analysis Paralysis can be a big issue in Mombasa. As stated, this game is really hard. Many, many times, players will have to rethink about ways to get things done, and often they can only start doing so when the player going before them completed their action. Some players will say the game doesn't flow smoothly and can kind of drag.

(-) As much as I admire the fact that the game is balanced in a way which denies players to re-use winning combination of action cards, on the other hand, this can at times feel a little annoying. Another example: When after much hard work, you opened up an extra action slot, soon you realize you don't have enough cards to utilize all those slots and you realize that using extra slots will dilute your deck even more.

(-) 7 Rounds is so little. You get so few actions to get so many things done. In most games, I see this 'tightness' as an advantage, but in Mombasa, I get the feeling the game would have benefited from at least one extra round or so. The very limited amount of actions makes a rather unforgiving game even more unforgiving and it also means you can get very little use of the action cards you buy. Most will only get used once, twice or three times... On the other hand, the seven round in Mombasa give players just enough time to reach the end of the bookkeeping or diamond track and doing some crutial actions elsewhere on the gameboard. 7 Rounds is acceptable but (too?) tight.

[u]Conclusion:[/u]
So, here you have it: A wolf in sheep's clothing. Mombasa, underneath its trite title and ordinary cover sleeps one monster of a game! If you're not in for some hard and sometimes unforgiving mind crunching work, you better let it sleep. However, if you and your gaming group are in for a serious challenge and are willing to commit a considerable amount of (waiting) time, Mombasa will reward you with some ingenious deck-splitting mechanisms, many good/bad opportunities for challenging paths to go after and a balanced gameplay in which you can be sure the game will give a delightfully/frustratingly (depening on your mood) hard time for everybody around the table, no exeptions!

[u]Tips:[/u]
(*) The most straight-forward strategy is probably the diamond trail. Obtaining some diamond merchants will quickly boost your diamond score. However, this strategy will reap the least benefits along the way and the max of 60 points it delivers will be destinctly unsufficiant to win the game. It will complement other strategies, but won't get you to victory when your sole focus lies there
(*) One of the harderst paths is the bookkeeping track, effectively melting your brain with impossible puzzles. However, you will get income along the way if you play your cards (books?) right and this strategy complements nicely with some other strategies (as doing it right means you will also have had to invest to a certain extent in goods and exploration actions).
(*) I think it is quite impossible to do well on the share tracks of all 4 companies. I would advise against it, after all you will want at least one company to kick out of Africa when your massive exploration turn kicks into action! Better focus on one or two company tracks - and it better be the right ones! (try to build up a good stock of good cards which match the 'max'-bonus of the company you're going after).
(*) Money, so easy to spend, but so hard to aquire... Use it thoughtfully and sparingly.
(*) There are some main paths to scoring many points, but in my experience it is better to combine 2 of them, rather than focussing solely on one path or going for everything.

Reminds me of the bid cards in Bremerhaven, being able to buy new cards to help in bidding. In here, from the description, it appears one is able to buy new cards to add to their current set of action cards, instead of values in bremerhaven here it is actions. But I could be wrong. Interested. Same time frame as Bremerhaven as well.

The sum is less than its parts! Many - by itself very interesting - layers that don't fit well together and thematically make little sense. One of the very few examples of a game made worse by the - intense - editing process: the original game '1830' was an, admittedly unpolished, gem; a fun 60 minute middle tier game. 1000 hours of editing later, 'Mombasa' is well polished, but no longer a gem. Now dramatically prone to AP and tediously long due to the bonus actions and, worse, the book(keeping). Thats like doing ones taxes while at the dentist and listening to Justin Bieber. Other changes like the rewards from countries and the diamonds are nice, but small in comparison.

I'm now certain Essen 2015 was a weak year, so this ist still the 2nd best game of the fair! (I consider only 7 Wonders:the duels to be better)

So many options and ways to approach the game, but the rules are deceptively simple. I say deceptively because the game setup swallows a good chunk of the rules. Once you get going it's all smooth sailing though. Push the diamond mines, keep up with the tricky bookkeeping, explore and conquer. Which do you first though? There's cards and shares to buy, but there's a wonderful mechanism that tempts you to hold off spending before your opponent does. Very clever stuff.

This is the economic, exploration, worker placement, family game I've been looking for. We're rather enjoying exploring and bringing it to the table again and again. Probably plays best with three - competition and speed of play makes this the sweet spot early on - but with four experienced players we can get through this in two hours (about an hour less than with inexperienced players).

The mechanisms of this game are great!  Love how you build/explore regions to raise the stock price, which then becomes area control with competing stocks.  Bonus powers for hitting certain stock shares.  Each card goes to its own discard pile and you can only take 1 pile back.  The bookkeeping track itself is very interesting with the move as far forward as you can by having the matching resources in your hand.  And there is a cool diamond!  Overall, there are a lot of different things to do, but they come together flawlessly.  Jenn loved it too!

There are a lot of interesting things going on in Mombasa, but I don't enjoy the overall implementation as much as I expected. The way cards cycle encourages planning, though it is difficult to line things up and fully plan everything out. The company tracks can really influence how much you want to invest in which company and change the values of the cards. It feels a little harder to play than I really want it to. In particular the book track is not something you have to focus on, but if you do, it's extremely unforgiving of mistakes. In addition, I didn't expect the stocks in this game to bother me, but I just don't find them compelling. It's still a fun game, but I don't want to play it nearly as much as other games.

RATING: 7
Excellent stock acquisition game with some deck-building and area control thrown in.  I really like how the mechanisms all integrate.  It isn't easy to figure out on one play, so more plays are needed, but it certainly isn't a mind-blowingly heavy game.  Everything makes sense and is easy to understand.  It also played much faster than I thought it would, but there are only so many actions that you can do with the cards at your disposal.

Another play of this has bumped it up in my opinion.  So many twists to this fine game.  It's excellent.

And now that I've played it a few times, it's been bumped back down.  There are a couple of things that I don't particularly care for - the fact that you can totally ignore the bookkeeping track and still win easily, for example.  This went from a promising game to tradeable after just 4 plays.

Mombasa's tricky hand management system strikes a chord in me. Throughout the game, I'll constantly make mental notes about which cards I need for the next round, which columns to play cards into, and so on. All that matters is managing my own little bookkeeping puzzle, and I have a deep sense of satisfaction (unhealthy, even) when that ink pot glides over several books at once. 

However, Mombasa is really a shareholding game at heart. In fact, it's very possible to ignore bookkeeping altogether and still win. The reverse doesn't apply – you can't expect a victory if you've stayed away from the shares. It feels as if the designer envisioned two separate, great games, but melded them together and smothered one in the process.

That said, the shareholding system holds up well, and it's refreshing to have a Euro which focuses on shareholding as opposed to moving up tracks or gaining majorities. The game in itself isn't too heavy, nor does it pull you in several directions at once – just remember to play the shares, dabble in either diamonds or books, and you will realise that your options are actually fairly constrained. But a minor drawback is that Mombasa runs a little too long for what it offers – expect a playing time of roughly 150 minutes for a 4P game.

It's actually a fairly solid economic game, with the chance to invest into different companies adding a nice touch. It takes around half of the first game to get into it, but with two games on record I gotta say I'm slowly growing fond of it.

Mombasa is a fantastic game and one of my favorites ever. I really love the decisions behind what cards you are going to play each round and which column you are going to play them in. Then there are the actions, where you have to carefully decide when to use your card abilities and if waiting will cost you a card or bonus spot that you really need. Despite the complexity of the game, it really is a fairly streamlined experience with only a few rules exceptions. The game is quite fiddly and prone to analysis paralysis at times, but it doesn't ruin the experience for me. My main issues with the game are: 1) it can be a long game, and 2) certain strategies just aren't as powerful as others. I think the last point is remedied considerably by the Cooked Books mini-expansion. This should be included with the game in my opinion and it makes focusing on the book track a more viable, and indeed powerful, strategy. If you like heavier Euro-style games, this is one of the best.

“Until the lions have their own historians, the history of the hunt will always glorify the hunter.”

Intellectual juggling at its finest:
"(deep breath) you play 3 cards that you will have to discard in 3 different piles and you will pick up only one of those piles, so you have to plan ahead on what you will discard where. Plus you have to pay attention to the order on which you play things because some of the actions go in combinations with your cards but only if you haven't played them. Plus you have to watch out if the company of which you have stocks are doing well in covering different regions of Africa, and oh my gosh!"
I mean, if you like medium-heavy eurogames you can't go wrong with this. I have only 2 caviets with this: first is that it is more strategic than it is tactical, but even if i'm a more tactical person myself, i love it; second is that it may be that it only works well with 4 people due to its area control nature.

Excellent game, best I've played recently. Lots of awesome things in this. The SAS in choosing the cards keeps things moving along more quickly. There's a real challenge in managing your cards, because you have to decide which stack to play them in, as you can only recover a single stack at a time. You also have some planning and control over your book track as you can decide how to line up requirements in order to move more quickly along it. The various companies add a really cool area control aspect to the board, plus you have a stock element where you can take advantage of another player's investment in a given company. Acquiring new cards has a nice purchasing mechanism, as newer cards cost more and you need to use up some of your cards. The real challenge is the timing, as once you've used the cards for purchasing, you can't use them for collecting bonuses. There's so much going on, yet it all comes together in a nice package that it's not terribly hard to understand what you need to do, yet you're competing with your opponents. The interaction comes in the timing and on how the companies are on the board; you definitely spend a minute once the cards are revealed in order to decide the order in which you're going to take the actions that you previously selected.

2 plays (both slightly wrong!)

It's a cool mix of things:
- deck-building(ish) like Rococo, with a twist: there are 3(-5) different discard piles; each turn, you will reclaim cards from only one of them
- action selection: use cards to select 3(-5) actions each turn; you will activate them one at a time (in turn order) to expand on the board, advance on personal tracks (for endgame VP and/or immediate bonuses), etc.
- worker placement: to get a few key actions available on the board
- area/share majority: as you spread a company's influence on the board, you get more shares in that company; these will be worth varying VP depending on how much the company has expanded
You really have to plan at least a turn or two in advance, and you have to get the timing just right: don't get yourself 5 actions if you can't manage to get 5 (good) cards into your hand every turn! consider turn order, and don't count on doing something someone will take before you! 

The various game systems integrate very well with one another, with the possible exception of the diamond track (which seems a bit tacked on). Brilliant!

I enjoy Alexander Pfister's other games, but this one falls flat for me. This is an area control with deck building/hand management mechanic. I usually like deck building/hand management games, but this hand management mechanic I just found frustrating (maybe it is just very unforgiving?). It is also frustrating that in the last round almost all progress made on the stock price could be reversed. The one thing I did like was how the book track worked, where you are trying to lay down combos in order to jump over more books.

Very hard to rate game. 
Everything is functional with a good heaviness relatively easy ruleset. Really feels like a Feld without the point salad. Mechanics are mishmashed together without coherence with a thin theme. It still comes out has a very good game with a good mix a tactic and strategy. At only 7 turns, it doesn't overstay its welcome either.
I'd like to play again to get it right as this game really needs a learning game, but I wouldn't want to buy this or play it very often. It would quickly feel samey.

Another complex efficiency puzzle from the more-is-better school of point-salad game design. 

I was primarily interested because much of the scoring derives from a sort of stock market. Players can advance down four tracks, each of which grants some combination of shares, money and bonuses/extra action spaces at different points. Share values are determined by moving the houses associated with the track out onto the board using exploration; doing so earns some combination of money, advancement along the share tracks, diamonds and book points.

(What are diamonds and book points? Never mind; I won't start with mine symbols, action discs and max. bonuses either. More, more, more, [i]more[/i].)

But it turns out to be a small share game tacked onto a complex, solitary efficiency puzzle. The card and book mechanisms very strongly encourage careful future planning, and there are just so many possible actions that it can be paralysing. Which is to say, if you enjoy that sort of thing (fans of Kanban, say, but who prefer less interaction), it's right up your alley.

I really like the mechanic of having to choose which discard pile you get to put into your hand for the next round of action selections.  So you have to plan which pile your place your action cards in so that the best cards for you are put into the correct discard pile and can be retrieved quickly.

Euro with a lot of moving pieces. There are interesting decisions to be made, and I enjoyed my play of it, but there is a bit of a disconnect in the mechanisms. Also, there is a bit too much "take that" in a sense that one group of players can push out others on the board. Not a huge deal breaker, but does knock it down a peg. Also, the goods feel a bit too samey. Wish there was more differentiation. Still a good heavy euro that I could see going up to a 7 to 7.5 with more plays.

EDIT: So far it is staying between a 6 and a 7 for me. The game is interesting, but it can be really brutal if someone goes after you. You really need to "follow along with the pack but pretend you're not in the lead" to do well since if people think you're winning they can stomp down on you hard. It isn't a bad game but not something I'd want to play over and over.

I've never had such a hard time learning a game and yet enjoyed it so much.  Our first play was brain melting and delicious all at the same time.  A superb design that plays remarkably well with just two.  I can't wait to play this one again.

Though it would be hard to get to the table, I see this game having multiple strategies while you are still meddling with each other. The various setups and order in which cards are available greatly increase replayability so this might actually be a Euro worth owning. One point that worries me is the 'point salad' as I find it usually detracts me from any theme or tension the Euro might possess. I happen to be more fond of engine-building type of Euros combined with a (secret) combo you pull off just to snatch that victory, compared to 'grab a little here, grab a little there and oh the game is over can someone take out the calculator' tension arc these games usually bring.

For the various strategies, interested enough to play it some time.

My pick for game of the year 2015.  The action selection mechanic with the multiple discard piles is quite innovative and one of the most clever mechanics I have seen in any game.  

This game could be a 10 to me if not for some of the luck related to how the books come out, making that strategy seem too risky.  If it falls into place just right, the book track is extremely powerful - more powerful than any other strategy, but that's the problem, you simply don't know how the books are going to come out, and early investment into books that eventually stalls out can leave you feeling like you'd rather have taken the $$ instead.  Nonetheless, the book track is much more solid than some would lead on based upon a lot of the criticism I have encountered for that particular track.  I think it has some flaws, but it is much better overall than most seem to give it credit for, and you ignore it at your peril if someone else is poised to capitalize on it.

Nonetheless, Mombasa makes its way solidly into my top 10 of all time, and it ranks as my #1 Pfister game (yup, ahead of Great Western Trail, which I think is another great game).

RATING: 7.5
tl;dr: very good indeed

Let's get this out of the way: I screwed up majorly. I had this whole strategy which would probably give me the victory. Too bad that I realized too late there was no way to actually execute this at all since there were only two rounds left. The result was that my strategy was just a huge unintentional kingmaker move.
That being said: this is indeed a very solid gamers game. I've played a few good games from this year's Spiel crop, but this one certainly ranks among the best, especially among the heavier ones. If you want one of those good heavier strategy euros, make sure to check this out.

A mechanism buffet. The hand management system is far more interesting than in execution than I thought it would be. With only seven rounds in the game, planning on how to deal with this is crucial: where you are going to place your cards? which cards you are going to buy? when you are going to go for the fourth action card slot?

When I read it in the rules, I kind of shrugged, but it's actually pretty great. Believe it or not, it's what keeps this game from being multiplayer solitaire. You really need to try to anticipate what your opponents are going to do, and then react to their decisions on stock track, the area control portion, and the worker placement field. It's the most effective example of indirect interaction I've ever seen in a Euro in that I feel like my opponents' decisions really, really matter.

The biggest gameplay issues are the diamond and bookkeeping tracks. The stock tracks are integrated nicely, but the diamond track and the bookkeeping track are tacked on. The diamond track is at least pretty straightforward to score with, but bookkeeping feels really convoluted.

Worth mentioning that the theme is really clumsy, and I'm curious as to why Pfister went down this dark and challenging road only to have the game end up a mechanical exercise in point scoring. I have no problem with dark and problematic themes, but is there any functional reason why this game had to be about African colonialism and exploitation and not... like... literally anything else? The mechanism-forward euro-heads clearly don't care about this, but it's got kind a Puerto Rico attitude toward its material in spite of its half-hearted acknowledgment in the rules.

Lots to think about! A very good euro. As typical with euros both attractiveness and theme leave a lot to be desired, but this game is so good, it doesn't really matter that much.

I love how many things you have to consider when placing your cards. What do I need? In which rest pile do I want this card to go into? In which order shall I do my actions to benefit the most? If I don't do that special action now, will someone else block me from it? Ahhhh, gaming goodness.

I don't really have a pony in this race, but full disclosure: I am a friend of the English edition publisher and helped demo the game over four days during the Essen Spiel 2015. That said, despite four straight days of nothing but Mombasa, I haven't tired of the game. On the contrary, the intensive Mombasa immersion allowed me to see some of this game's subtle depth ... there's a lot here and experienced/skilled players will definitely have an edge. On a more general note, I just love that everything in Mombasa fits together well and works cohesively. This one is challenging enough for true gamers, but rather than being a sprawling point salad affair as is becoming so popular in the current design meta, all the elements in Mombasa (which has a little deck-building, a little hand management and a little work placement going on) seem tightly interwoven. It feels like a balanced, tight, polished design. A refreshing offering given all the under-developed, under-playtested Kickstarter games now on the market!

Rating after one play at Essen. Heavier Euro. Cards you have played return to your hand with a delay of a turn, and you can pick up only one of three (later more) discard piles, so you have to think ahead. I am not sure how often I would play this, it is probably a bit too heavy for my taste.

RATING: 8.5
What an outstandingly beautiful design! The game combines several known mechanics but doesn't stop there. It adds new layers also, most prominently the action slots in contrast to the resting slots. This feature will give you the most wonderful kind of a brainburn. Let'S take a look what else makes this game so brilliant. 

- You get to quarrel with finding the right balance between your private scoring grounds vs. the common scoring grounds.
- It's got the tiniest bit of deckbuilding. Think Concordia with obtaining just some more cards during the course of the game and trashing even less instead of amassing huge decks of cards
- It's got the slightest notion of worker placement in shape of the bonus markers. 
- Area control (direct confrontation)
- Imperial-like share holder and scoring system (Hey, another company is coming along nicely on the company track. Why not get involved there?)
- you can do actions focussed on a specific use, but in order to do so you'll have to split up your card resources and thus you won't be able to do another focussed action like that any time soon. So think twice about how powerful you wish for an action to be or if you want to split it up more evenly during followingrounds
- The game already enables you to pursue different strategies. Long-term replayability and flexibility is given with different track companies to combine. 
- You know that games sometimes seem to be dominated by any given mechanic, i.e. Dominion and deckbuilding, which is fine. But here all the mechanics come together and none of them seem to dominate. They exist and correlate in perfect harmony, everything fits right in where it belongs. 
- The game enhances both long-term strategies and tactical decisions
- Timing when to activate your additional action slots is crucial (more isn't always better) 

It truly is an amazing game

Solid classic euro. Paste on theme, a lot of thinking through.

Pros: Although I usually do not enjoy a heavy mix of different mechanisms, in this game it all "clicks" very well and you have some clear and tough options to choose from. 

Cons: No real theme. 

Surprisingly enough, I found this game refreshing as it reminded me that even pure euros can be very enjoyable, despite the complete absense of meaningful theme.

Great heavy euro game. It combines many elements together and works with minimal downtime between turns. There are many paths to victory, and many times the path to victory depends on what your opponents will be doing. There is interaction between players but at a higher level. It is innovative. In many games, you build a deck, here you build a flow of actions. It is a very interesting concept.

RATING: 5.5
When you sit down to Mombasa, it's overwhelming. There's a lot of icons and six tracks, and a card market and extra action spots and it is more than you can process. Once you learn the game though, it's really not that bad.

The game is essentially a stock market game. Four of the six tracks you can advance on are just flat out companies that you're investing in. The farther up you go on those tracks the more shares you earn in that company. There's also some bonuses you get along those tracks. But the value of those shares are determined by board presence. Well... kinda. As you put more houses on the board, it reveals spaces on the company's board, some of which have coins, and it's those coins that determine the share values. The other two tracks are simply alternate ways to get points, but also can open up extra card slots for you to use.

The way the game works is that you play a card to each card slot face down and then simultaneously reveal the cards. Then, in turn order, your trigger one type of cards to do an action. After the round, you pick up one of the piles above your board, bringing it back into your available hand of cards that you can play in the next round. Then you shift the cards you played this round from below your board to above your board. So you want to think about which cards you're playing as they'll be unavailable until you pick them up in a future turn. And which pile you put them in is important, as how many cards are in that pile, and what those cards in that pile can do, and whether you need them back now or later, will influence how quickly things will cycle back to your hand.

There are three types of cards, three different types of goods (which vary in stength), exploration cards (which also vary in strength) and specials (which mostly advance you on the two non-stock tracks). And the late game cards you can buy will often have a share on them... so you might buy the card for the share more than whatever else it might do for you.

When you trigger goods cards, you can either spend those goods to buy another card, or spend those goods to advance on some combination of the stock tracks or both (but only ever buying a single card).

Exploring allows you to put more buildings for a company on the board, possibly knocking off other companies buildings (perhaps covering up one of their coin icons and devaluing their shares). Exploring also gets you some bonus thing usually.

You also have two wooden bits that can be placed in some extra action spots. There's often a race to get to the best actions and/or start player.

For all the complications, like the book track which isn't worth explaining, the game really is a pretty straightforward stock market game.

In my first play the other two players ganged up to push the red company and I got left out. There was some concern that the game might not work with three so well because of this. But I suspect that might not be true. The player who won ended up going all the way up that track, getting nine shares, and bought another 4 shares of it from cards. So the 11 coins that were revealed for red translated into 143 points for him (more than my total score as second place player) . The third place player who had been pushing red hard as well only scored 44 points, while I, who had largely ignored it, scored 22 points. If the third place player hadn't been pushing a stock where he was a minority shareholder, I think the game would have been a lot more competitive. So I'm going to chalk this initial blowout to bad play rather than the game being broken with three. Like any stock market game, if you're not valuing things correctly, you can make the game wonky.

[thing=172386][/thing] is a game filled with options and rich in paths for players. While the set up can be hassle, preparation of the components beforehand can help a lot in this.

Explaining the game, even with its complexity, gave us less trouble than the other designer work, [thing=193738][/thing]. Also, when comparing both, the play had a more lively pace and we understood the gears of the mechanisms faster. [thing=172386][/thing] has a fine replay level, coming from the semi-random draw of cards as well as the set up of the companies.

The limited number of rounds pressure players in making efficient plans, trying to the get to most of all actions. This is increased with the addition of the best mechanic in the game: the way used cards form draw piles for the future, which brings forth the necessity of forming the draw piles in the best way possible, in order to use them with a greater effect and timming. The way it works is very organic and neat, truly giving much to think.

Overall, [thing=172386][/thing] is a game that mixes several mechanics - hand management, simultaneous action, deck building, worker placement, etc - which usually scares people, as coupled with its many possibilities, could become bloated, harder to learn and teach and too heavy, pushing the fun out and dragging the gameplay to a sluggish pace. Yet, nothing of this happens in a worrisome level. The flow is fast, quite dynamic and clever. When compared with [thing=193738][/thing], [thing=172386][/thing] is a little less fun (likely due to the theme), drier and more mechanical, yet it seems to be more well-round and tighter, even with both demanding long term planning. Recommended!

Played the game at a gaming evening. Explanation of the rules took forever, but the game flowed really well.  I had the idea that each player had a shot for victory with different strategies and ideas. 
I had a huge last turn, completing ten books in one turn, but was not able to snatch the victory. To set this up was to much of an investment apparently. Also, I really enjoyed the interaction with other players. The way the ownership of the stocks and the value of the stocks of the different companies work is interesting and creates the opportunity for difficult decision making.

I've found both of Pfister's recent big games - Mombasa and Great Western Trail - quite difficult to enjoy. I enjoyed this less than GWT. 

Both appear to suffer from rulesets too large, cumbersome and countrintuitive for the fun they actually support. The games themselves are a hodge podge of refried euro-tropes - tracks and tile /card markets being a favourite - with some vaguely innovative puzzle mechanisms thrown in. Mombasa has a deckbuilding mechanic which add some new considerations by eschewing the discard pile in favour of a more complicated (and less random) setup. But its not obvious that the friction this presents is actually fun. The stock dimension is also flat, value being modulated via a simple area control game.

Mombasa is a solid, complex Euro by Pfister who is at the peak of his creative powers. The game spots many interlocking mechanisms that some how doesn't feel like a hodge podge of ideas mashed together. The game flows really well and the mechanisms while complex, feel really intuitive. I particular enjoyed the action selection mechanism with the cool down period. This card selection also has a spatial component to it as recycling cards depends on the stack which the cards are played. As only one stack can be reclaimed at the end of each round, distribution of the cards is paramount if one intends to chain together a series of actions and card powers in future rounds.

Overall the game is tight, tense and filled with angst. While the player interaction is high, it never feels frustrating. This is a sign of a good design: a game that has a high amount of interaction but players can still plan and execute their long-term strategies without having being bogged down too much by player choices. For that to happen, the game needs alternative paths to acquire resources. Mombasa does that really well. I really love games like Mombasa where players are given different methods of securing victory. Everybody is free to choose their own paths and usually, the most efficient person will win. I can see several ways the game can be won and specialization is not optional.

That said, there are a few negatives. First, the bookkeeping track is needlessly complicated. The icons on the books are numerous and not always intuitive. Worse, the bookeeper feels like the weakest track compared to the gem track or working to gain shares in the companies. Time will tell.  This is one area that could have benefited from further streamlining. I also felt that the game replayability can be enhanced by a modular map. The printed resources on the regions never change as is the company that is attached to the sides of the map. As a result, I can see that play may feel scripted ( For example, I will always know where to find the two gems regions on the map and how to attack that region). Then again, I have the luxury of a large library of games. Minor complaints for an excellent game.

JOGAÇO!!! Quero jogar de novo para confirmar, mas tem potencial de ser o meu TOP 1! Talvez seus únicos problemas sejam o tempo longo de: setup, explicação e tempo de jogo, mas de resto o jogo é maravilhoso e gostoso de se jogar. E apesar de ser extenso de se entender a princípio, não é difícil, as ações fluem muito bem, um mérito total para a iconografia, uma das melhores, comparável a 7 Wonders. Incrível como um jogo cheio de detalhes como esse consegue fazer com q jogadores o entendam logo de cara. O tema tb casa muito bem, as mecânicas, quantidade de possibilidades de ações, a pontuação apertada, ... Enfim, tudo faz dele um queima-mufa de primeira linha, mas muito divertido e inteligente. Inclusive pelo seu diferencial, a ótima sacada de ter companhias de comércio independentes dos jogadores, criando inúmeras possibilidades de estratégias e caminhos para a vitória, junto com a mecânica de ter que escolher as cartas com base no uso, um ar de "solução de design elegante, inteligente e original" q é uma deliciosa dificuldade extra no jogo. E no final, apesar do jogo a princípio parecer até mesmo espartano visualmente, depois do tabuleiro cheio de feitorias fica lindo. É Pfister no auge, mirando bem alto e acertando mais uma vez.

I was hoping for a share game with a euro game tacked on.  It ended up being a soulless modern euro game with a share game tacked on.  

For me this is a steaming pile of garbage.  It shaves off the best bits of a train game and adds in the worst bits of a modern euro game.  All players can be equally invested in good companies, there is no meaningful route building or blocking as everything can be undone, and lastly the personal bonuses for building can often far outweigh building in a colour you have shares in for points. On top of that this game has a miserable amount of player interaction for something with a train game base. It's limited to the usual Euro style action / resource denial. The shares and building are less interactive than ticket to ride (a non-train game with a train theme). The game also goes full point salad mode including points for tripping over. There are TWO tracks to boost for points that are completely unrelated to the core game on top of many other avenues to pick up points (cards, building, taking books, shares, selling cards, etc...). The final nail in the coffin is that the game is won by the player who best manages a solo puzzle that none of the other players can interact with - the whole hand and discard pile management thing. So even the minimal amount of interaction is worthless.  /Puke

Clunky action pawn mechanic that feels tacked on and unneeded in light of the interesting card selection mechanic for actions. Why have to actively "claim" Most Hats or Most Bananas with a secondary action pawn that is so completely disassociated from the card selection mechanic when those Most Of benefits could have simply been claimed at the beginning of the action phase according to who had the Most Of showing in their tableau? Super frustrating disconnection having two completely different ways of taking actions on your turn. 

Far too many ways to accrue points. No theme whatsoever even though it has a contentious setting. No interaction whatsoever. You will sit quietly, not talking to each other for 2 hours, staring at your tableau, cards, and the board trying to minmax every turn.  

I love "heavy euros" like Kanban, Panamax, and The Gallerist yet Mombasa is inelegant, extremely clunky, and ultimately boring in comparison to all of them.

Good solid euro that I will play anytime I'm in the mood for a medium-heavy euro. A lot of the same feel as Great Western Trail but I prefer GWT. The most memorable mechanic was the multiple discard piles mechanic which is genius. However, it is a bit too much of a point-salad for my taste as I tend to prefer streamlined scoring systems with convoluted ways to achieve the scoring. The biggest downside is that this would probably not be my go-to game when faced with multiple choices of heavy euros.

This game is great. It seems a little dry before you dive in, but the mechanics carry it to greatness. The management of your 3 card decks is unique and genius. The competition on the board over different areas is a nice refresher when it comes to Euro games. Deciding how to use your turns to upgrade your gem track, board position, or deck is amazing. 

It's a great game, highly recommend everyone at least try it out to see some very clever mechanics all come together to make a great Euro. It has terrible Shelf-appeal though. Took me 3 times of being offered to play it before I said yes, and I'm glad I did.

good but very unforgiving game. love the advanced planning. if you fuck up, it screws you for at least one additional round and there are only 6 rounds in the game. very well-designed and tight.

One of the best Euros to come out in years. An interesting mix of forward planning, action drafting and shared incentives; the turn angst in this game is palpable!  ONLY WITH 4 PLAYERS

This is another long-ish game with mechanisms that I tend to like, but I already have a lot of those that I'm trying to play more to better understand. I don't want to add yet another game to master to my list.

I really like this one. It is a longer euro. I love how all the elements come together. I prefer 3 player game or even 4 player. With just two players it just feel weird... My wife won't play this one so it doesn't hit the table that often.

RATING: 8.4
Excellent game though my least favourite to teach. That is in part due to the nature of the highly interwoven mechanisms involved and simply that it has a lot going on. I have played now at all player counts and although it is best at 3/4, it plays surprisingly well at 2. The game has a good progression to it and feels quite dramatic as it reaches the end. Look forward to more plays.

The best way to describe this game is "What would happen if Stefan Feld designed an 18xx game?". It's a game of many interlocking puzzles, but there are no Victory Points to be found here. The only thing that matters is how much money you have at the end  and the majority of that money is going to come from the stock market. The game follows the basic structure of investing in a company, taking control of its expansion and the leveraging that expansion into big end-game profits.

The weird Feldian part is that the stock acquisition is completely abstracted through a deck building mechanic, with cards purchased by playing sets of goods cards. The played goods cards are then sent to 3 or more different discard piles. At the end of the turn, you get to return ONE of these discard piles to your hand, creating yet another puzzle. Deciding which discard pile to send each good, in order to maximize the speed in which you get them back is a real brain burn. Accompanying that is the use of several mini-games, meant to reward the player for time spent plotting out a big combo turn. In that sense, it feels a lot like Macao or Trajan.

Unlike Macao or Trajan though, there isn't quite enough time to synch up the three mini-games of stock acquisition, diamond mining and book keeping. It seems like yo have to pick two and go hard at them, otherwise the game ends before you can do much of anything and since everyone is investing in the same companies as you are, doing a little in each arena won't be very productive. Go big, or go home.

All in all, I found Mombasa to be extremely easy to teach, despite all of these disparate mini-games going on. It is surprisingly brisk, making it almost a filler game in the right crowd, despite the depth of thinking required. Of course, this also means AP could be thick in some groups, which I suppose is the reason it is often mentioned in conversations about Euros, even though mechanically it's not that intense.

I'm bitterly disappointed. I adore Alexander, but this is unfortunately an uninteresting mishmash of barely related mechanisms that are bordering on completely abstract puzzles that keep score groupings narrow until a Mexican stand-off in the last round to see who can set the final values. All of the important decisions aren't interesting decisions, but worse than that, they aren't meaningful decisions & ultimately yet again, it forms another game that plays far too long for something utterly unrewarding.

A solid hodgepodge of mechanisms with an interesting twist on hand management. Good variety and just the right weight - it's on the hevier side, but without going overboard. Still, there's something in Alexander Pfister's designs that just doesn't grab me, I'm not the biggest fan of his style. His games are overstuffed with all these little ideas and mechanisms that work together, but are ultimately "artificial", dry and forced.

Wow. This game is a lot of fun, very hard to master. I'm not sure what the best strategy is or even if there is one. I get the sense you just need to woosa the ADD, pick a damn strategy, and focus. But damn that's hard.

It just makes you want to keep playing. Solid game.

Soldi game, with complex rules, that plays quite well and with a nice sensation of "are we already at the last turn?". There's a lot to do and not enough time to do it; it seems your engine starts just two turns before the end.
It's quite original in its action recycling mechanic; the rest is similar to any other german but with interesting choices anyways.
Besides being long (without giving much of the feeling of being long) the main drawback is the lenghty setup (reminiscent of Feld).
Anyways, a good german.

I'm not sure what I was expecting with this game. It languished on the shelf for a while, largely forgotten about due to its bland cover and four player maximum (my game group nights have been growing). It was about to go up for auction when I walked my wife to try it out with me.

I had read the rules a month or so back and generally understood the game, but upon opening the box, I did not feel confident explaining it. I did my best, but still committed the ultimate sin a board game explainer can commit: reading directly from the rule book while teaching. My wife took this very well and in two rounds we both understood the game well enough, with some rule mistakes here and there.

It's not like  pat games I've played before. It has some elements of those games and some that I haven't seen and it combines those in interesting ways for a game that's innovative while feeling similar. The card play is pretty unique [i]to me[/i], where you have slots you play cards to, and those correspond to separate discard piles. Before you discard at the end of your turn, you can pick up [i]one[/i] of the discard piles and now you have those cards. Picking the correct column to play to is an interesting decision.

The other wrinkle is the stock system that rewards both diversification and specialization. I've played both ways and can say that both strategies seem valid.

About my only concern now is longevity. I can look at this game and say that it has a shelf life and it's in the 10-20 play region. However, I so rarely play games that much, so this is barely even a downside.

If you have any interest in euro games and stocks didn't already chase you off, give this one a shot.

Recommended.

It may turn into a "recipe" game after repeated plays, but for the present time there is great replay factor!  A three or four player game enables the share value of the trading companies to vary within the game, reducing the possibility of a predictable outcome (i.e. in the last round the exploration cards can re-arrange the value of each company).  Great tension and build up as the game progresses...I like this game a lot!  One complaint is that if you don't plan well, the last round can be kind of anti-climatic.  So, play the "long game"!  Let's hope expansions are on the horizon to keep this game "fresh"!

The excitement and angst slowly builds and the last round is cathartic.

Economic stock holding simulation involving the colonization of Africa. Programmed actions from similar sets of cards with some deck building. Additionally, there are interesting worker placement actions to further manage diamond mining, plantation commodities, exploration and expansion, investment and bookkeeping...bookkeeping?

After Trajan, this was my next foray into euros.  All other games I played that were not euros paled in comparison to this game.  These two games were when I discovered that I am really only into medium-heavy euros. (Nov 2015)

Diverse Internetbeiträge über die Komplexität und den schweren Einstieg von Mombasa haben mich eine lange Zeit vom Spielen abgeschreckt. Allerdings muss ich sagen, dass die Regeln weitaus werniger komplex sind als vorher angenommen. Mich hat das Spiel extrem gefesselt. Die strategischen Möglichkeiten sind mit die Besten, die ich bisher kennengelernt habe.

Too many mechanisms that add up to nothing. The gameplay itself is clunky and convoluted. Ultimately, its just not very fun. 

This is a complex game, but the complexity is not the real issue. Each player progresses along several different, uncorrelated game tracks. It is not so much a worker placement game, but more of a collection of half a dozen loosely connected mini-games. 

This opinion seems to be in the minority, but we found Mombasa to be disappointing and overrated.

Heavy euro with some deckbuilding weird & awesome mechanics, I have a great time every time I play this game.

Problems: The bookeeping track it´s useless and the Mombasa/exploration combo seems biased.

I hope to solve the first problem with the mini promo expansion (that I havent played) and the second problem seems to be no problem with experiencied player who knows that Mombasa stocks are usually fueled by explorations actions.

Game mechanics work well together to give a relatively interactive game. The artwork is ok and game components are high quality. Setting up and keeping the game can be a bit of the hassle due to the many game components involved. The theme felt rather pasted on, in particular the book-keeping and diamond track, which detracts a little from the share acquiring and share price manipulating parts.

Me gustó mucho más que su hermano "Great Western trail" los comparo por ser del mismo autor y muy cercanos en el tiempo.

Me gusta mucho el uso de las cartas y las buenas sensaciones que deja, eso sí, hay una estrategia loser que admite el propio autor.

Very good game. Very impressed! Its a deck-building, worker-placement, stockholding/commodity speculation game which is really quite good.  Played basic setup and advanced setup; they are all very good and would definitely recommend this game!

Adjusted value down by 1 -- for the simple reason there is too much to teach or explain to newbies or new players.

Elsőre kifejezetten tetszett, pedig a szabálymagyarázatnál volt azért pár nehéz pillanat. Menet közben viszont összeáll a dolog és még ha nehéz is igazán jól játszani, élvezetes az összkép. Az elmondások alapján kicsit szárazabbnak gondoltam - valóban nincs benne túl sok tematika, ettől függetlenül szórakoztató a dolog és keményebb euróként nem is éri el az agysistergős szintet. A kártyamechanizmus nagyon ötletes, várom a következő játékot vele.

In my first game, in the last move of the game, I could influence other scores by a total difference of 30 points among each other (with scores around 120-140 points). I don't think that this is something that should be possible in the last move, even if I engineered myself in that position.

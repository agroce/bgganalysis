Very abstract and I'm not keen on abstracts but.... from a slow start this game continues to grow on me. The master version add some elements of strategy to what is a very intense tactical game. I think it's ideally suited for a PBW type environment - try boitejeaux.net

Got in trade (La Isla) from montag66 5/22/15.

Played for the first time with 4 players and was ahead in the first 2 phases, but then on phase 3 got denied a few spots and ended up in last.  Fun game!

A quick tactical puzzle game.  The player interaction is largely figuring out how to piggy-back onto your opponents's builds.  Action cards create interesting choices and can be very powerful.

RATING: 7
Very good for 2-4 players, strategic, and a bit dry on theme, but still fun in my opinion.  Can't stand the luck of the cards though, so I use the option where everyone has their own same set of cards to minimize the randomness of the draw.

Kind of a brain burner, somehow I won by like 30 points, despite being confused for most of it and not spending many action points on action cards.  My three opponents all ended up right next to each other, though, so it was almost certainly some fluke that shot me ahead so far.  Not sure I like it enough to play again--sadly, having played Tikal and now Torres, I don't think I like the action point system all that much.  It leads to a lot of paralysis and ultimately, you still only have one optimal move which, given enough time, you could figure out.  Maybe with a timer or something to prevent that from happening--otherwise I would just get frustrated, feeling rushed and forced to make ANY move.

I don't play many abstract games, but I love Kramer's Java. I picked up Torres on that basis, and I like it a lot. The card-play takes the edge off the abstract chess-like positioning of pawns, and the stacking of pieces is delightfully tactile. It's simple to learn but there is real strategy here. 

Traded away for Friese's Landlord which I think was a good trade. I don't play many abstract games and this one wasn't getting to the table much.

Torres is one of those classic abstracts that gained fame during the early days of modern boardgaming era, and I guess was fairly popular at its time. However, today it is highly unlikely to see anyone playing it. Another rare feat to see today are the beautifully sculpted plastic tower pieces (excluding those ridiculous kickstarter exclusives).

Personally I like how the game starts to develop, i.e., grow upwards from the board level. This is visually pleasing and creates a clear dramatic arc to the game. The game is a pure abstract but the growing towers help to bring it closer to earth. Typical to its time of release, the rules are rather simple but leave a lot of room for different situations to arise during a game. I reckon that Torres would not survive the competition today but I find it complete and solid.

Super game.  I've only played it with two, but would imagine it would be just as good (if different) with 3...and maybe a bit crowded with 4.  I found this lighter than I thought it would be.  I was expecting something almost as heavy as Chess, but though this resembles that in a few small ways, it's actually much easier to play reasonably well.  Yes, it is a bit dry and the theme is a mite tacked on, but despite that, it's not heavy and is fun to play.  Tactically and strategically, there lots to think about.  You can plan several turns ahead and the plan may or may not prove actionable.  I like the rule were each player gets identical cards at the start.  That means that you have to use them very carefully and gives no-one an advantage with a random draw.  The mechanics of how you place and move pieces and where you can place towers is well done and the action cards and Master Cards add a lot.  Add to that, the great art work and this would be one to get for most people.  Altough it's slightly mathematical (nothing more than basic times tables), it's a great game to play with a partner who likes games, but isn't a died-in-the- wool hard-core gamer....and I think it would work as a family game to play with teenager, too.  That's a lot of positives for the game, so it deserves a high rating.

A neat little game that is almost as fun to look at as it is to play.  The gameplay requires devious thinking, as your high-scoring towers can easily be nullified by encroachment from other players.  I'd like to play this one some more!

Torres is a simple, short, somewhat abstract game. The castle pieces, knights, and action card are extremely well done. My only issue is that I wish the scoring pieces and spaces were larger on the game board. Aside from that, my one game of Torres was a  4-player game and I definitely wouldn't mind playing it again!

My favorite aspect of Torres is the 5 action points per turn. You can place a castle piece on board, add or move a knight, pick up an action card (selecting 1 out of 3), play 1 action card that was picked up in a previous round, or gain a victory point. I can see how Torres can perpetuate analysis paralysis, but with only 5 action points to work with, I can't see it getting out of hand.

I was fortunate enough to have the rules explained to me, so I don't really know the difference between the regular rules vs. the master rules. Of note though, you get one master card at the beginning of the game that lets you score additional points if you fulfill the requirements (for example, each knight on the outer perimeter of the game space earns x points). However, some of the requirements are extremely difficult to complete (such as the all the knights next to each other one - must have been lost in translation). 

In a 4-player game, there could be an issue with turn order. After each year, the king is moved by the player with the least number of points, who also becomes the player who starts first. And it seems like the player that is last has the biggest advantage since he/she can base their strategy on what everyone else has done. Wait, that doesn't really make sense - will have to work on this part some more, but what I'm trying to say is that maybe the turn order for all players should be set. 

Tracked on family game list (grooven).

RATING: 8
Very thin theme. Almost an abstract strategy game but still very good. The master version is particularly thought provoking as you have all of the cards available to you. Keeping track of what cards your opponents still have in their hands goes a long way toward doing well in this version of the game. It is however much better than the basic version where you randomly draw the cards since some cards are more powerful than others.

Cool towers, build the gameboard as you go, action points, Kramer.  Again, how can I NOT love this game?

When played with the "advanced" rule of having all special cards in hand, this game is BRILLIANT.  Plenty of resource optimization, with opportunities for strategy and planning.  With a touch of "take that!" as well.

Get it.

Lets be clear, Torres is very lightly themed.  The theme of knights rebuilding towers to please their King fits what happens on the board, but is quite forgettable.  Torres plays like a multi-player abstract, with a touch of chaos added by the action cards.

Like any good abstract, Torres gives you lots to think about - in three dimensions too - at the expense of very few rules. As in all the Kramer/Kiesling action pointers, the five points you get in Torres are just not enough to accomplish everything you need to do in your turn.

I generally play the version where each player has their own deck, and chooses from three cards each time they draw.

This is a great game.  I'm not generally a fan of abstract games, which this more or less is, but this is an exception.  It plays quick, and its game play is unique in a few ways.  Also, there is a pretty steep learning curve.  You really don't pick up on all of the strategies until you've played quite a bit (e.g. more experienced players will play knights much more defensively).

Enjoyed this, which is unusual for me as multi-player abstracts really aren't my cup of tea. I think a lot of my issues with them stem from having only one or two actions per turn which just never seem to be sufficient to do anything interesting. In this game you get 5 action turns & some special move cards which is ample to set yourself up with some nice little plays.

rather disappointed with how lifeless this one felt.  i have only played it with master rules, and i think i'd actually rather spend APs to draw cards from my own deck than automatically burn 1 card per turn.  i agree that it is a good game, but i honestly don't understand how anyone could find it to be FUN.  i'm still technically curious about it, but i'm not sure i'd even play somebody else's copy when given any other decent choices.  lots of thinking, lots of downtime, nothing really engaging or rewarding about it.

A lot of strategy in this abstractish game.  The plastic castles are pretty cool, but the game itself is kind of dry.  I have a problem with the scoring system in that there are only three major opportunities to score, and HUGE scores by the end.  Not that I really know how to improve upon the current system, but I get a bit annoyed with huge chunks of points at once.  It moves fairly quickly, however.

This is a deep, tactical and strategic game. The complaints that people have of it are very valid. You can only do two things: move knights and place towers. The cards have limited scope.

Potential brain-burner with plenty of strategy options.  Players must think several turns ahead to get the best plays in.

Terrific 3-dimensional game of stacking and scoring castle levels which you place your knights on, with an action point system for deciding your moves, placements, and drawing action cards that flesh out an even deeper game design.

Brilliant game, where you can be really mean to your opponents. A mix of the action point mechanism from Tikal, combined with the spatial building from Medina, and a 3D aspect of its own.

It's hard to explain why I like this one so much, while disliking the similar, yet thematically richer cousin, Tikal.

And yet, that's exactly the case. Maybe it's the fact that the components of Torres are much nicer. Maybe it's the fact that spending 5 points, in less available options, makes for much less AP than 10 in so many.

And then, maybe it's the fact that this one has no pretensions of being anything but a well crafted abstract strategy game. Unlike Tikal, which pretends to be the great exploration game it's not.

UPDATE [07/23/2010]: Still liking it, but after a few more plays it becomes apparent it doesn't bring much new to offer at each play. It might get a bit stagnant after a while. A good game, but without much replayability it couldn't go higher than a 7.

I prefer playing Torres as a 4-player game using the Master Rules and Master Cards.  Without the Master Rules, Torres is simply less appealing.  I would rather play Mexica for it is more streamlined and has more depth than the basic version of Torres.

What distinguishes Torres from the rest of the Mask Trilogy is the long-term planning of the Master Card scoring. The downside is that it locks you in to following a particular path, so it feels less dynamic than Java or Mexica.  However, I happen to enjoy games that feature long-term planning, so it is a non-issue for me.  I own the original edition with the Alessandra Cimatoribus artwork.  The new edition also stacks up really well.


Master Version Variant Rules:
A. Players choose the initial placement of castles.
B. Action cards start in hand.
C. Highest score = Starting player.
D. Master Card
  
I created some variants:

A surprisingly strategic game.  It is built around simple rules for placing towers and building castles, but you have to out-wit your opponents to be placed such that your pieces score maximum points from the castles on the board at the end of each round.  Luck is almost not involved at all.

RATING: 9
ActionPoints, MultiOnly

The bits are so wonderful (I have the German version, which has whimsical board art, and I prefer the warm tan of the tower pieces, even if they are squat).  And the game play itself was wonderful, although perhaps I'm just fond of action-point systems.  I like the stacking towers regardless, and you need to play the advanced version (with all 10 action cards ready in your hand).  I really have to hand it to Fawkes for emphasizing the theme though---it added an extra charming touch.  Mahvelous.
  
I keep this game around for the whimsical theme and the unique mechanics.  I don't find the game too abstract, actually---but I guess that's mostly because it involves castles, and I have a hard time thinking of anything involving castles as being abstract.  The addition of the action cards also spices up the "abstract"-ness of the game.

Rating based on one play. I enjoyed playing this game, but on the other hand it will never become a true favorite. It is a rather weird mixture of an abstract game coupled with a random card draw. I generally like drawing cards, but in this game the cards are almost a bit too powerful, they can win the game for you. We played the basic game, and I have a feeling I would enjoy the advanced game more as this reduces the randomness somewhat, but I am pretty certain it would not improve the game to the point where I would actively try to play the game. Not bad, but not excellent either.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
A bit of a classic. The rules are not well written but once we got our heads round them this turned into a great game. Maybe the action point mechanism is showing its age a little but the brutal battle for scoring, the difficult decision making, the ability to block and to sneak round blocks all made for a really fun game. Now on my wish list.

Abstract brain burners aren’t my cup of tea but, true to its title, at least Torres has those nice stackable towers that make playing it so much more attractive.

It’s still a themeless abstract though.

Initial Impressions:
------------------------
Interesting building game with a cool 3d stacking aspect to it.  The game does seem to have a ton of downtime though, since it can be a bit hard to plan your turn since so much can change that will cause you to rethink your best move.  Advanced mode is definitely the right way to play.

This, Java and Maharaja are Kramer and Keisling's gamer masterpieces, and this is the best of the bunch. Played with non min-maxers, or those who are quick at it, makes for a most enjoyable gaming experience. I love the action point system for its allowance for creativity. My preferred way to play is with all the action cards in hand.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not a bad game with 3 or 4.  The 2-player game was a let-down though.  It can easily devolve into you-do-this-and-I-do-the-mirror-image-move.  The master rules help that a little.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Game was as good as I expected it to be.  I'm finding I prefer more abstract games and this one fits the bill.  At least with two, you can plan ahead some but yet it allows you to make a killer move on your turn.  Looking to play next time with the 'everyone has the same cards' variant.  

Rating could go up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Among the better of the Action Point games from Kramer, Torres still suffers from many of the same flaws.  Namely, the game consists of more computation than is really fun.  Nevertheless, Torres delivers the thrill of a wicked move with an exceedingly convenient action card rarely seen outside the likes of Magic the Gathering.  It also has the good sense to end much more quickly than its brethren.

A multi-player abstract that is pretty good.  It is an optimization game.  Almost anything you do can help your opponents so there are lots of tough decision.  The master cards and rules add some randomness (but nice variety) to the game.

One of the first games that initiated the move from Magic: The Gathering to the broader landscape of board games for me. Unlikely I'll ever trade this one away.

I liked this one right of the bat. It's a mathy puzzler; Totally abstract and themeless but I do find it visually appealing, which can't be said of many games from that 'era'.

I don't like the basic variant where you draw action cards randomly. Actions quite differ in usability and luck of the draw doesn't fit a game of this kind.

The play is somewhat abstract, but with enough theme and bells/whistles to make it interesting.  In terms of area control, this is a nice one, as it forces competition and tight finishes.  The vertical aspect really adds a lot, and it's competitive without being cutthroat.  We're looking forward to the master rules now that we've played the basic game a few times.  Recommended.

Excellent abstract game featuring the signature Kramer & Kiesling "action-point allowance," with a nice hand management mechanic thrown on top. I'm not usually a huge fan of "3-D" spatial abstract games, but this one I thought was really tense and thought provoking. You really have to be aggressive about scoring, though, which was a huge turn off for my husband. The game is also a little dry, and since we both prefer a few of Kramer/Kiesling's other similar designs to this (Tikal, Java, Bison), we sold it off.

This game is a fantastic strategy game. I had fun learning the tactics and strategies of this game with my wife as the complexity, yet continuous fun, made itself known.

I now prefer using the Master rules as it eliminates the chance of someone getting two or more of the powerful "move out any door" cards while another gets stuck with three of the "jumping" cards. You are also better informed on defense, knowing what cards your opponent has already played.

Outstanding game. Probably the best abstract strategy game I have ever played.

Tight resource management, which I like.  A little abstract for my liking.  Downtime was not much a problem.  Have only played with 2 players, though.  Very quick plays.

After a handful of plays it doesn't feel like there is much tactical depth here. The action cards are critical to making the game enjoyable--which is why I prefer the master version where you start with all cards in hand. The master goal cards are also a necessity; otherwise the scoring forces boring and predictable game play. I'm also unconvinced of the latest edition change where you can keep all unplayed tower blocks for later turns.

RATING: 7
A neat little action point game that's pretty squarely on the abstract side.  Players spend actions building castles and moving their pawns in order to score points off from those castles.  The game requires a lot of tactical maneuvering, as you're trying to set yourself up for good scoring positions while thwarting others from doing the same.

While most of the game is completely devoid of luck, there is a deck of action cards each player can draw from, which grants a special one-time use ability.  This throws some surprises into peoples' moves, as they allow players to make moves that are otherwise not possible.

Overall, just a good and relatively quick game.

[floatleft][ImageID=45084][/floatleft] 
[b][thing=88][/thing][/b] - My wife and I had the opportunity to learn this game yesterday.  I consider myself something of a [person=7]Wolfgang Kramer[/person] fan, and his collaboration with [person=42]Michael Kiesling[/person] on [thing=37734][/thing] produced one of my favorite games ever, so needless to say I was optimistic.  The game, however, was simply okay.  

[i]Torres[/i] is an interesting spatial puzzle in which players want to have knights in their colors on highest floors of the largest buildings in order to win favor with the King.  This is achieved by spending action points to expand the buildings and to move the knights.  The whole system was fine, and I think it worked well to achieve its goal.  However, this type of spatial puzzle simply doesn't resonate with me, and I therefore found it wholly innocuous.  Moreover, the point-scoring system (building points= knight height x surface area) is the sort that would likely be easy for many, but which doesn't come naturally to me (I frequently needed to stop and think about whether an action point was better spent moving this knight up or expanding that other knight's castle), so the game was less fluid and tense than it might have been for other people.  Still, [i]Torres[/i] is another game that seems to fall in a gaming middle-ground that I have increasingly less room for.  Perhaps I've been spoiled by the longer, more robust Euros that have been released recently, but putting something like [i]Torres[/i] side-to-side with something like [i]Troyes[/i], I can't help but wonder why anyone would bother with the former (aside from perhaps time constraints).  

At the end of the day, [i]Torres[/i] is a clean, simple, light-middleweight Euro that is executed well, but that has little to recommend it in a crowded market.

Based on 1 play with 2 players: Only played the simple version so far, but I enjoyed it! Has that great "too many things to do, not enough points to do them." angst. Simple rules, but gives players a good amount to think about on each turn. The scoring is a bit mathy, but at least it's clear what to do to get more points. This game is pretty abstract, but also manages to feel very unique. There's something viscerally satisfying about building up towers and watching them grow. I can't wait to try again with the master rules! I really suspect that this game's rating is going to go up with more plays.

New Edition (not Bobby Brown):  The new version isn't as ugly as I first made it out to be.  Once you start playing it, the playing area is quite pretty.  The scoring track could have used some color, and the cards could have used some English text.

Old Edition:  This game is beautiful.  I love the look of it, and wonder why it needed to be updated.  This is the most pure and tactical of the Kramer action point games.  Tikal is better because it lives well within it's theme, where as here the theme is pretty irrelevant.

This one took some time for me to like. First 5 or so games I was schooled by more skilled players and it took time to grow with this game, because it has some crucial moves that can swing the game. I've played Torres many times now and can say its a great abstract game that is visually appealing. I love the tension as to when to play the cards in hand, and that's probably my favorite part. This can induce some AP, and the downtime can be a bit long, but it's worth it. It's not a hard game to learn it's just difficult to it just takes experience to learn the nuances the game has. Classic abstract and a great game with 2-4 players.

Rated 8 after one online play, so my rating might change based on a face-to-face play.
 
I've always been a big fan of Tikal. I love the playground for spending action points to do what you want, while also playing a game that leaves you wanting to do one thing more. I traded for Torres hoping it would be equally engaging while offering something different.

After one play, I'm impressed. The need to "level up" with the stacks of castles is pretty cool, and I'm sure I haven't even scratched the surface regarding how to maximize movement and the action cards.

I played a two player game, and I suspect that three or four is more enjoyable. Otherwise, it seems like a very straightforward game of giving and taking away from the opponent.

We have only played the basic game, with 2 players, and all of our games so far have been close.  This is an excellent game, that provides interesting choices on each turn.

RATING: 5.5
Much better with four players than three as the board becomes crowded and squabbling is more frequent.  The two player game however is a vicious and angaging duel.  Nasty, deep, and intrigueing.  Excellent game.

The known card decks in the master game move the basic game from a relatively shallow and uninvasive game with significant luck elements to a perfect information brawl with minor run-away leader problems.

Only one play, but I really liked it. I'm not really a fan of Java or Tikal, but I would play this again right now. Lighter than the other two, I think, and the strategy a bit less abstract. Maybe I just grasped this one more quickly, but it seemed much more accessible.

Post-second play: Love this game. I think I know why I prefer this over the others in the K&K AP series, which is that there's no taking points away from other people. I can only think of one thing you can do to take points away from someone else, and that takes a special action card. Otherwise, you can only work to increase your own score, which I really like. But, I don't think this is any more accessible than the others in the series. It's just that I'd played the other ones which prepared me for this.

I enjoy each of the action point games in this series (if you include Torres with Tikal, Mexica and Java).  Torres is the most unique of Kramer and Kiesling's AP games. The charges of no theme are ridiculous to me.  Maybe I just enjoy using my imagination more during games...but I have no problem feeling that I'm commanding a crew of knights building towers for the aging king.

I have not played using the Master Cards, and they seem like a turn-off to me.  Maybe after a while they will be more appealing, since I still feel that I have a lot of Torres yet to discover.  At this time, my preferred variation of play is to give each player their deck of cards and allow them to pay 1 AP to draw 3, keeping one.

RATING: 6
Much more straight forward and fast playing than the mask themed AP games but still plenty of interesting things to consider. Not as much of an area majority game because the scoring has nothing to do with the other player's placements in the game, which felt a bit odd to me in that it is impossible to directly interfere with the value of other player's pieces by your own placements, but still interesting. I really liked the action cards a lot, as they allow for some interesting alterations to the board. The game is very customizable too, so if one likes the basic idea of the game but feels that it needs a tweak that is easily accomplished within the system. In my plays so far the "you start with all of your action cards" variant worked best. I have also played the "personal deck, pay 1 to draw 3, choose one" and the standard "pay 1 to draw 1" and I felt that the latter two restricted the action card use too much (because there just aren't enough points to use) and because the cards are what make this stand out for me I didn't like the game as much that way. I think the "start with all the cards" might be too generous though...I'm considering a middle ground where each player chooses, say, 3 cards to begin with, and can buy more cards (of their choice) for 1 AP per card, that seems like it would be a good middle ground. I still don't even know how I feel about the Master cards in theory... 

Overall, a good game that I enjoy playing but it's not as deep as the other AP games. I like what the action cards add to the AP framework, and the speed of the game (1 hour solid) is a real plus but it still doesn't grab me as much as the Mask trilogy. The non-majority based scoring system irks me to a large degree though...just not as tense. This is the game that is most clearly based on the original concept for this game, Terra Turrium.

With the Master Scoring Card and a hand of ten Special Move Cards, Torres is definitely a heavy game.  It is one of the heavier euros I've played (Die Macher, Roads and Boats, and Antiquity are certainly heavier), yet the ruleset is small.  The vertical build of the board is a nice change of pace, and Torres works well for two, three, or four players.

This is a nice little game. It is unlikely to become a favourite because it is too prone to drawn out AP with an aweful lot of downtime. Mind you my one game so far was 4 player with one of the slowest gamers I know and that's saying something cos I'm pretty slow myself. Also it is a little too abstract. On top of that the game tends to reward somewhat negative play - blocking opponents a lot. This isn't extreme but I did find the game occassionally frustrating. May drop to a 6.
Despite all this I actually liked it well enough and I would definitely give it another shot to grow on me.

Abstract game. Reading about this game, left me thinking it was a great game. But now that I have it I'm not so sure. The gameplay is fun, but it doesn't really pay off to build your own towers, since being a parasite is much more efficient.

Maybe if you play it with 3+ players this doesn't happen as often. Or maybe we should just use the special cards instead.

Traded this for Race for the Galaxy in a Mathtrade.

RATING: 4
I'm not sure what to make of Torres. It features the familiar AP-mechanism Kramer and Kiesling introduced into the world of games. But it feels a bit artificial in this game. Numerous actions are restricted to make the game more difficult and gamey, while the background story is rather weak to say the least. (It doesn't have the power of Tikal & the gang, for example.) Also it becomes physically harder and harder to place knights and the like once the board begins to fill up. I can understand why this game ranks amongst the worst selling SdJ winners of all time. But at the same time I can't say why I feel indifferent about this game. Perhaps it needs more time to grow on me...?

[b]Update[/b] I never bothered to find out if that would be the case, and sold this game on without much regret.

[b]Update 2[/b] After many years I played this game again, and I think I know what is causing my lukewarm reaction: apart from the action points, there is no extra mechanism to compete against the other players. Tikal, Java, and Mexica all use majorities in one form or the other. Not so in Torres, where it's blatant min-maxing and perhaps an occasional annoying interjection to prevent someone from scoring too readily, i.e., creating a larger ΔVP. A second aspect which gets on my nerves, although in a somewhat smaller amount, is that because larger amounts of VPs are created and added together, the dynamic range of the scores become annoying to deal with. Finally, someone who is behind in scoring opportunities will find it hard going against those in the lead: those folks can easily draw neat action cards thus cashing in on their lead by exchanging it for powerful flexibility later on. All in all a game in need of further refinement—which happened, fortunately, in the excellent Mask trilogy which remains a collection of timeless quality games, even at the time of writing this comment (late 2015).

This one really surprised me.  After reading the rules, I was having serious doubts about the game.  It seemed excessively complicated, and many of the rules struck me as finicky or tacked on.  It was a bit of a toughie to explain to my opponent, as well.  

But by the end of the first game, everything had clicked and the rules were fully understood by both players.  Once that had happened, a shift took place and the game no longer seemed complicated at all, and was suddenly rather simple and elegant.  You can accomplish quite a bit with five action points, and it's supremely satisfying to use a card to pull off a particularly clever move.  

Very fun and interesting game, and my score will very likely increase with repeated plays.

ONE YEAR LATER:  Indeed, my score [i]has[/i] increased with repeated plays.  Some aspects of the game still seem cobbled together and inelegant, but I find the actual turn-to-turn experience highly satisfying.  The process of building and climbing is fun on a very fundamental level, as is the delight of sneakily benefiting from an opponents' work.

This is a case where playing online can be a detriment.  I really find it hard to visualize the 3D board, even if it's not, strictly speaking, necessary.  So this one I'm considering a preliminary rating until I play it in person.

In Torres, players are playing a positioning game to try and get your knights on the tallest points of castles that have the largest areas.  But castles can't touch and you only get a few action points per turn.  To help you along the way, you have a deck of cards that you can select one at a time.

This is really an abstract game (what theme?) with an action point system.  It's not too tough, but may not be right for everyone.

Production: Superb production, with hefty, plastic towers that make sturdy stacks and whose heights are easy to calculate.  The artwork around the board is attractive and interesting, without being distracting.  Once the game is in full swing, it is a beautiful sight to behold.  I would prefer if the score track didn't go so high (and we had to lap it), and that it didn't zig-zag around the board.  It makes it difficult to move the scoring pawns.

Play: The game is very elegant for an action point game.  I find that each turn is an exciting, interesting challenge to increase one's position, to out-maneuver one's opponents, and to plan ahead for the coming turns.  Lots of opportunity for clever play, blocking, and usurping.  Despite the lack of luck, seems to always play out differently. (3+2+5) (9 plays)

Although maligned as an abstract I enjoy the small castle pieces and it does feel like I'm building one. This game is best played with a long term strategy in mind. The first round you play to set up and then reap rewards in rounds 2 and 3. We always play with a Master Rule, occasionally two, but that gets chaotic. We also play that each player gets a deck of action cards, instead of the base game rule of buying one. You need to correctly use your action cards to get a competitive advantage in the gameplay. Tight, fun and relatively fast to play, once you get a couple of games under your belt.

Torres is an abstract game of resource management and tactical pawn movement. Players are attempting to build up castles and position their knights to score the most points each turn. Players have a limited supply of knights and action cards that allow special actions to be taken. Efficient use of pieces and cards, along with a thoughtful awareness of future possibilities, is the heart of this game.

For an abstract, I like this game very much. It's a bit too "mathy" for me, but that's not a deal-breaker. The action cards really add a necessary element of surprise and tactical thought. The artwork on the mapboard is really nice. I wonder if anyone ever made a high-quality wooden version of this game...

I find some of the action point costs and legalities of passing through existing castles a bit confusing and there's a tiny bit too much downtime for my liking (a symptom of any game with large quatinties of action points per turn), but overall a good spatial minimaxer game.

A different game that is great to admire and discuss when finished.

Very tight game, there are not many opportunities to score points and you must keep an eye on your opponent(s) and keep up with what they are doing.

This is a fun and engaging game for small groups. It is unconventional, but that is why it shines. The abstractness of its core concepts may make it unpalatable to casual gamers or newcomers to the hobby. But for those capable of thinking outside the box, it provides a highly enjoyable experience.

I should like this one by all accounts, but find it strangely boring and uncompelling. The action point system feels artificial and the game is all about what you cannot do, rather than what you can do.

Dry and numbingly slow abstract game where players spend action points to move their knights around a board, build levels, climb those levels to try and cash in when the scoring occurs.  I'll admit it's clever, but they left the fun out.  Also, once a player has a lead, it's very easy to defend it.

I want to like this more than I do, but it's a little too much work to find the best combination of actions each turn, and scoring is very tedious.  I think I'd like it better as a play-by-web game.  The tower pieces are fun to play with, though.

I've played this once, but had problems with a couple of the rules, so I need to replay it before rating it.  My intitial reaction is that neither the theme or the gameplay seem as fun as other similar titles by these designers, and the rules seem less intuitive, so I'm not sure how often this will get played.

I have enjoyed very much my first game of Torres when I played. I purchased Torres at the 2005 WBC. The WBC at Lancaster, PA was a good life experience and my first ever.

I am happy that I found this little gem of a game at a good price compared to what it was selling for back home when I purchased it. 

Torres is an interesting Abstract Strategy game. One of the few Abstract Strategy  games which I enjoy playing.

I could be considered to be in the game line as Java, Mexica and Tikal in my opinion.

TRADED.

RATING: 6.5
Interesting. Runs a bit long. Also, the third round of the 4-player game is relatively static. There is still some "execute the strategy you planned out last round" sorts of things to do, but I think that it hurts the pacing of the game.

The 2-player game seems to be biased heavily towards the second player.

I'm starting to find the huge amount of downtime in this game to be frustrating, especially since it's often difficult to plan during it. 3-player seems to be the best number of players.

A beautiful game with good gameplay, I found it difficult to teach new players, as concepts involving where castle pieces can be added were always hard to explain and understand. The 'master' game should always be played, as it effectively grants extra AP while reducing luck of card draw. This game grew old for me, with every game sort of feeling the same.

Game is elegant, gameplay is fast and rules are simple BUT the scoring is headache. At the 3rd scoring, we had to have a calculator because everyone thought that other players counted wrongly. Scoring wouldn't be a problem otherwise but because all the castles must be scored at same time and the counting can be like 33+24+17+8+19+28 per one player at the 3rd scoring.

Many players say that Tikal's scoring is terrible, I think it's nothing beside this (though there can be AP problem with Tikal...). 
I think there should be a pocket calculator included in the box (I placed one to my box after first play).

Own it but have only played online. As the game progresses, the AP gets a little daunting. I tend to want to calculate out the current score in order to decide what to do. My rating may drop a little over time. Definitely use the "all cards in hand" variant if you don't like the luck element.

One play with three, and enjoyed it quite a bit.  My experience with the K/K Action Points saga is this and having played through Java alone, and I am quite impressed with the quality of the designs.

Torres clearly has miles of depth when all the manners of blocking are explored - we barely scratched the surface of the possibilities.  It does feel a little too short though, and since knights lock in their scoring positions (their scores can only go up if they stay put, unlike in say Java where positional points can be diminished by other players' moves) the moves seemed perhaps a tad calculable and overly clear.

Lovely accessible medium-weight abstract.  I've only played once (a 2-hour three player game) though we pored over each player's possible moves and their repercussions, so I feel like I know the game pretty well already.
  
It occurs to me that this feels like Carcassonne in 3d - you're building castles unavoidably collaboratively, but vying for primacy on each construction.

The action cards (one-use-only super powers) make it much harder to shut the door completely on the opposition, making for some great, desperate, unpredictable take-over moments (at least, I suspect, until you've played enough to know how to nail everything down, always).

Two minutes to set up, ten minutes to teach the rules and give some examples, yet I suspect it will yield a life-time of rewarding play.

Outstanding abstract strategy game of three dimensional castle placement, capture and control.

[10+ plays]It's hard to put my finger on why I like this game.  I don't much like abstracts, but this one looks very cool and the cards add a lot of ways to be creative.  Who can you afford to work cooperatively with? How can you build your castles for efficient movement later on? How can you set up the right situation to make use of a powerful card? Do you push for less large scores or try to score many small ones? How can you best benefit from the king bonus now and in the future?  There's just a lot going on in a relatively short play time.  I guess this game sort of fills the "abstract" roll in my collection and I enjoy it for that.

RATING: 9
[Spatial, Building, Action Points, Medieval, Knights, The Princess Bride, Wesley vs Inigo, Hello you killed my father prepare to die!] {2P:9.5, 3P:10, 4P:9.5} Torres is a game about rebuilding the defensive towers of a shattered kingdom. The King decrees that whichever of his children commands the knights that guard the highest towers at the end of three days will have demonstrated the greatest ability and will be named successor to his throne. Wonderful story and theming, with an even more wonderful game behind it. Torres is my favorite of the Kramer/Kiesling four-title Action Point Series. This is perhaps because Torres is the purest and cleanest of the four. Players essentially do only two things - play knights (either adding them or moving them around in the kingdom) or build towers. The action cards allow variations on the two primary moves above. Otherwise, the game is pure strategic (towers) and tactical (knights) brilliance. The execution of the game in three dimensions gives it a distinction not found in most German games. Excellent, plays in a much shorter period than Java, Tikal and Mexica. It's not a deep as Java, but is around the same weight as Tikal and is deeper than Mexica. I'd class it as a light-heavyweight, perhaps a bit more with the Master Cards in play. Playing what we call "Grandmaster Torres" 4P with all Action Cards in hand, free placement of starting foundations and with a new Master Card at the beginning of every day is NOT for the faint of heart, but is the best way to play the game if you have a group that finds this kind of outwit-outplay-outthink kind of game fun (and can process and play at a good pace). Love the whimsical Cimatoribus artwork in the original, but holding off to see the Vohwinkel art and redesigned bits in the new edition before purchasing a personal copy. (By the way, can someone tell me what the SdJ jury had for dinner when they gave Torres the prize in 2000? Can someone feed them the same thing every year?) ***UPDATE: Bit the bullet and purchased the original with the art by Alessandra Cimatoribus. I decided that while I think Vohwnikel is a pretty good artist, there's no way he can top the original art. And how much better can the components be anyway? If the new version is significantly better, I won't feel bad playing a friend's copy. I hope that the reprint brings a whole new audience to Torres, as it is perhaps the best game ever to be awarded the Spiel des Jahres. ***UPDATE: Ok, let's call it a renaissance. Playing Torres online at www.boiteajeux.com has allowed me to try the individual draw deck variant a bit more. It's very different, forcing one to decide between drawing cards (and therefore providing more options in the future) or prioritizing board play and drawing cards opportunistically. I don't think this is adding a huge amount of luck to the game, and there's a change of timing that's interesting and, for me, ultimately more challenging than the breezy, artistic all-cards-in-hand variant that's my Torres bread and butter. And hey, the new RGG/Amigo reprint is workmanlike. I like it much less than Alessandra's vision of dark fantasy, but it doesn't do the game an injustice. Grab it now.

I have only played this medium length and intensity game with 3 players and I think it would play better with 4.  I like the action point mechanic and the turns move much faster than in some other action points games (Tikal).  The rule breaking card mechanic is a nice touch as well.  This game is sort of middle of the road, not interesting or different enough to play all often but not bad enough that I don't want to play it when somebody else mentions it.

A szokásos Kramer szinvonal. Egyszerű szabályok (az akciópontoktól nem tud elszakadni :) ), gyors játékmenet, egy gyakorlatilag absztrakt játék. 
A játékban várakat építunk. amikbe lovagokat teszünk. Három időpillanatban kapunk pontot a játékban azok után a várak után, ahol van lovagunk. Számít a vár alapterülete és a torony magassága is. Ezen felül van még egy király is a játékban, ami kicsit fel tudja zavarni az esetlegesen kialakuló állóvizet.

Szívesen játszanék még vele annak ellenére, hogy az absztakt játékok nem az erősségeim.

Great castle building game, bordering on the abstract. The basic rules with random card draws stress the luck factor too much, IMO. Best planning doesn't help if the opponent draws the right card.

Be prepared to do a lot of waiting for your turn.  The stackable towers and the little pawns were well-designed and add a nice aesthetic, and I think this game utilizes the action point system very well.  I also like the way each turn (usually) involves precisely one special move, which are laid out on cards in front of you.  Still the same, it takes too long to play and requires too much deliberation!

Captivating. Playing this game is a lot of work but, compared with other demanding games, it's not dry. At least, not for me. I believe this has to do with the fact that there are many player interaction opportunities (screw your neighbor, races, traps, ...).

Torres is a very aesthetically pleasing 3D abstract and definitely a highly interesting game of strategy. It's pretty much an abstract but the use of the Action cards and the Master end-game objective bring it to a rather different level to more traditional abstracts. Certainly one of K&K's best.  This is a great use of the Action Point system, a system that K&K very much popularized. Some of the rules regarding movement through castles is a bit difficult to wrap one's head around, but otherwise it's a pretty easy game to teach to new players. Good times!

Another interesting Kramer offering.  Torres is both an abstract AP game, and area control.  The interesting element in this game is both the action cards, how they allow one to break rules, and the third dimension.  Games like this often have one only thinking on a two-dimensional plain whilst Torres provides a need to calculate and manipulate heights as well.  I find Torres plays better with three and four.  Two is ok, but can lead to isolation-  players have to be aggressive.

A classic. Quite a clever abstract with a thin theme for the components- which are nice enough. As abstracts go, this is one of the better & more interesting.

Quite interesting, if themeless.

RATING: 7
The action point system doesn't run out of control here, as five points offers a pretty limited set of actions on each turn.  The power cards make things interesting without feeling too chaotic.

There is an unfortunate potential to get locked out of victory fairly early in the game.  Certain regions of the board quickly turn into major point factories; players who fail to establish themselves in those regions will quickly fall behind, and there's no mechanism for punishing the leader(s).  This defect leads me to downgrade Torres to a 7; I'm less inclined to play Torres now that I realize every game will play out this way.

Obtained at a Tuesday Morning...played this game once a few years ago.  After a couple two-player games I am very excited about playing Torres, in spite of a negative initial impression some years ago.

After several plays with differing number of players, I'm convinced that Torres is a very special game indeed!  It is elegant and beautiful, and its mathematical scoring is balanced by the strategy and tactics of its board play, while the cards add a bit of random seasoning to this excellent stew.  I traded away my original copy but came to my senses and acquired my 2nd copy via Geek Trade.

On the surface, this is pretty simple; but the rules for moving through castles can be truly mind-bending. Full of difficult decisions, and you have to keep a close eye on other players to make sure no-one gets too secure in a big castle.

I like both the concept of this game and the play. Using the advanced rule of keeping one's own cards and choosing from the top three minimizes the randomness, without making it completely deterministic, which keeps the play moving. Brilliant concept; excellent game. Best of the action point games.

Torres is an area-majority game where the areas are defined during the game. A lot of different moves are possible each round, and the way each player expands his powerbase in a region will differ slightly. Every round you spend 5 action points to position yourself on the board as efficiently as you can. Clever play can mean that players expend a different amount of action points to get the same amount of victory points from an area. The goal of the game is to get as much points from the different areas as possible while making sure that your opponents wastes as many action points as possible.

The game has some long term strategy (where and how to build your castles to block other players and at the same time create incentives for the other players to give you points by helping to increase your castles), but most of the game is tactical in its nature. Reacting to changes in the board, trying to fend off attacks by your opponents and at the same time finding weak spot in your opponents defenses.

Every move is an exercise in efficiency, and sometimes you know a move that you need to do, but if the timing is wrong you could play right into your opponents hands, and net them more points for less effort. If you get to a top spot in a key castle but you have to spend a lot of action points to get there and then even more to keep your position, it might be better to settle for second place in several castles.

Lots of creative and clever moves can be made using the special cards, and if you are not careful a knight can seemingly come from nowhere and steal a top place from right under your nose.

You can't make it on your own in this game. If you don't try to create incentives for another player to help you build, your castles will not get enough points. Expand your castle in such a way so your opponents can't help but go over there and help you build it.

Don't build too much. Oftentimes the person that spent less time building castles, and more time trying to position a few key knights will win the game. Use your blocks to remove shortcuts to the upper floors of a castle, or put a few blocks in strategic places so you can usurp someone elses castle, or - if it is scoring time - expand the base of castles where you are a few levels above the other players.

In my opinion, the king bonus is there to make the players fight over different parts of the board throughout the game instead of just focusing on building on huge castle. In my games this worked up to a point when players realized that often you can get the bonus while mostly focusing on the skyscraper. And if you missed the bonus on one round it wasn't that big of a deal. 
Now the master cards changes that, at least in our games. All of a sudden there is a viable alternative to just racing for the skyscraper, and the board topology changes depending on the master card we play. This to me is a big positive and I wouldn't want to play without the master cards now. Some of the master cards are easier to accomplish than others, and some are more fun to play, but they all change the pattern of castle building on the board. 

I really like the variant where you have all your cards open in front of you at the start of the game, and you flip them over as you use them. But in practice we almost always play the advanced rules with private (but identical) draw piles because it dramatically reduced the time it took AP players to do their turn. Besides, the added excitement you get from making a move that is either game-winning or devastatingly bad depending on what cards your opponent has, is a big positive for many players that otherwise might have felt that the game is too much of an abstract. It doesn't add an unacceptable amount of luck and creates another source of anguish because you have to give up movement on the board to buy cards, but you can't win the game without buying at least some cards. I'm happy to play either way.

I really like it with 4 players, and that's how I almost exclusively play it. It might be a good idea to limit the playing field with three players, and I would play another game if you only had 2 players.

Gametime varies depending on what master card we play, and from game to game. A quick game could go as fast as 30min, and a long game where we have really messed things up for each other could take somewhere around 70min. This estimate of course goes out the window if you're playing for the first time and have a few AP prone players. Last time I played this with new players I think we clocked in at the 2.5h mark.

One of the best abstracts out there. Problem is that I dont enjoy abstracts as muchs as other kind of games, but anyway this is a superb game and I enjoy it way more than other abstract games like Tigris and Euphrats. It is a tremendous two players game but I also like this one a lot with three or four players. Use always the master variant to reduce luck draws and be ready for a fantastic abstract experience, that you will enjoy even if abstracts are not your cup of tea.

This game has a wonderful nostalgia factor to it for me.  I used to play it with my dad at a coffee shop up north on Sundays. This is such a wonderful game, and the fact that you can play the Master Card variant not only vastly reduces the amount of luck to almost zero (first player selected randomly), but it also provides a different approach to one's strategy every play.  I couldn't recommend this game enough!

I don't normally like classical abstracts, and Torres is a game that feels very much like a classical abstract (by which I mean a two-player, luckless, themeless positional game).  However, the uncertainty of the cards, the multiplayer nature, and the wonderful three-dimensional gameplay are enough that, while playing Torres, I don't feel like I'm playing something excrutiating like Chess. ;)  It's a deeper game than its predecessor Tikal, although drier and less thematic.  I recommend the version where each player has his own deck, and chooses from three cards each time he draws.

A cleverly executed game about stacking your pieces up higher and higher and trying to get your knights (colored blocks) or whatever higher than the other guys to get bigger multiplyers.

Two or three plays online. I was surprised at how much I disliked this one. The standard game is a little wobbly because the cards aren't balanced, and the master variant has no uncertainty or unknown element while being a fairly simplistic game where points can be counted and chains of events can be mapped out, which in my experience leads to dry, stressful game play followed by a kingmaker argument. Beyond all that, I just don't find the underlying system particularly interesting, and so the game feels more like a chore than fun.

RATING: 7
2 or 4 player.

Alterations/House rules: We play with the 10 cards on the table, in front of each player and easily seen by all. They cost no action points to use, and only one per turn. We don't use the 'master cards', and all unused blocks are rolled over into the remaining stacks, even across game 'years'. (The PDF file from Rio Grande puts limits on the height of stacks not found in the supplied rules; the designers feel limits, as well as forfeiting leftovers between phases (years), is the best for 2-player and not 4-player games.)

The way I ordered the cards for use became a ‘game idea’ for me. I tried to force their use at certain points in the competition. I ran into what gamers have dubbed “multi-player chaos” very early in the second phase, thus the requirement to keep plans fluid. 

I was a little surprised at how cemented in place we all became in the third phase. One could occasionally move, but new beginnings were not to be found. One just needs to follow a rough script or outline that makes each phase, possibly each turn, a lone opportunity to be in a certain place or be left behind. It’ll be a title I’ll pull when I can find a group of pros, or I’ll settle for the 2-player.

The game was refreshingly different, and it made me wonder about how I could push things faster as a way to better optimize the tools I held. How circuitous can I make it, and how much can I count on others to perform in a predictable fashion.

This game took 15 minutes to explain and two hours to play.

RATING: 3
For whatever reason, the Kiesling and Kramer action point games make me frustrated and annoyed. I like a challenge, and I like games that playfully thwart me-- maybe that's the difference? There's nothing mischievous about the obstacles here. It's just a brute shortage; there aren't enough action points to do things you might want to do. Under those circumstances it's not fun to do the things I *can* do.

That's my theory, anyway. I just know I hated this.

Another action points game where you are trying to vie for the best position in castles built by you and your opponents. The higher you are in a big castle the greater the reward. Very abstract but, also a real killer when trying to get the best move in. Score track is rubbish! We always play the optional card set rule which allows each player to hold a full set of cards and play one each turn rather than the random pick up rule. Recommended!

This might very well be my most played game (if we include games prior to my logging, as well as online games -- I've put in my time in on yucata such that I might be one of the players there with the most plays there!) as I find this to be such a rich abstract that suits multiple players in a very engaging and creative manner. As the unofficial member of the Mask Trilogy, it fits in perfectly as yet another K&K "creative sandbox" action-point type game (e.g., you have longer individual turns in which you have a lot of creative possibilities that you can play with). The special action cards help increase the creative range (potentially allowing you to get in on point-scoring action that others did not foresee!). Furthermore, there simply aren't that many games that utilize 3-dimensional "tile" placement in such a meaningful and visually stunning manner (you really feel as if you were building castle, because you are). The only downside, and its not a critique of the game, is that if you play with players who "lock up" when presented with large decision forks (because they must run through every possibility in their head, or simply shut down due to being overwhelmed) and go into "analysis paralysis," the overall experience might become one that is less pleasant - but I repeat that this is not a critique of the game! This is my favorite game, bar none.

After playing a full four player game, I've raised my rating from a 9 to a 10.  This is just a fantastic brain burner that keeps scores close and rewards different styles of play.

The way scoring works is quite interesting and the cards make for a lot of interesting plays and even some subterfuge.  Seeing who has used which cards makes you play differently and block as necessary so people don't take over your towers.  It feels great to make a good play and it's easy to see what moves will benefit you to what extent.

Considering too the Master cards that are available that we haven't played yet, I think this is a game I'll keep bringing to game nights.  The AP of certain players can make the downtime a bit irritating but it gives you time to think about your ideal move.  It's a game that takes longer than I think it should, but doesn't overstay its welcome.  Good with both 3 and 4 players and an interesting yet abstract theme.

In particular, I like the closeness of the scoring.  It's tough to fall extremely behind in this game.  The cards can help you make some surprisingly strong moves and you can always hop on other people's established castles.

The only thing keeping this from a 10 is playing with people who take far too long to analyze their decisions.  I play pretty quickly even for this type of game, so the downtime is a bit of a turn off.

A nice, fairly abstract application of the Action Point mechanic, Torres is an attractive, reasonably simple but clearly deep 2-4 game of castle building and worker placement.

The workers are knights- and they are shaped like thimbles, but on the whole the Ravensberger edition has nice artwork, if slightly childish, and appears to fit in a smaller box, which is not a bad thing.

I like the game play, and I think it's decent enough, but it isn't thrilling, just involving and challenging enough to entertain.  The theme of this set seeems thinner than the mask trilogy of games.

I'll start this at a 6.75 on a 1st play, and let it grow on me.  It seems a good- not great- game, but it's solid enough, and I think I'll grow to like it more with plays.

This is a good, semi-cooperative game in that you often build on the same castle.  It has a lot of "Game Theory" involved in how much you help, and when you break free to try to win.  

It is also a good game for the younger family members, as it can be simplified.  A bonus is it helps to learn about area and volume.  (Some might consider the educational aspect a down side.)

The down side, as a pure information strategy game, there is little luck and very little you can do against an accomplished player.  

I have kept this as a lighter filler game, and something to play with the kids.

It's taken several years to buy and get to the table, but no wonder this design has had staying power for the last ten years. Another Kramer & Kiesling classic euro, with action points, and a visually and dynamically changing board. Area control with a "king of the hill" mechanic for scoring--the level/height of your knight is multiplied by the surface area of your castle. Well, it's really not "your" castle, as other players' knights can show up and feed off your efforts like parasites. The decision tree (or range of actions possible) is logical and not extensive, compared to Tikal (another Kramer design), so makes for quick play at slightly over an hour.

However, I think the game is ideally suited for four, as there was not enough tension with three players. The result of our first game was two people battled over a castle, while the third had a free reign and built his own super castle. There is not enough action points to fight off one player, while holding the third in check. There are action cards that can be bought, which may alter the play significantly, so those cannot be ignored.

Update (07/30/11): Played with the Master cards for the first time, and the advanced rules. The Master cards, along with having access to all 11 action cards, opens up the game to a totally new level, adding a welcome freshness to the design. The basic rules are pretty good, but there is a random element due to having to use one of your action points to search through your action cards and draw one for later use.

OK game, there's certainly strategy there, but there isn't enough of a "take-that" element (i.e., once someone gets ahead, it's hard to catch up).  At best you can latch onto his huge towers and get almost-but-not-as-many points as him.  AP players drag the game down.  Ultimately it seems like it's all about hand-management (i.e., when to play which card).  And so, it drags on too long for what it is.

게임 자체는 나쁘지 않지만 AP 를 이용한 시스템은
이제 유행에 뒤쳐진 것 같다. 

같은 AP 를 이용하는 Tikal 보다 재미가 떨어지는 것은
부인할 수 없다. 

머리를 어느정도 써야 하는 전략게임이긴 하지만,
대부분의 플레이어가 해야하는 행동이 비슷한 점은
마이너스 요소.

컴포넌트나 게임 보드는 상당한 퀄리티.

Neutral - on occasion

More abstract than [thing=54][/thing], but building towers is more fun than digging temple in Tikal. I slightly avoid games with lots of card effects, but Torres has only a few. Overall, these two(Torres/Tikal) share some similarities in many aspects, and I prefer Tikal more.

My favorite part in any game is just a touch of chaos and this game does that very well as long as you keep the draw cards rule in it.  Without that rule I would give it a 7.  Efficiency is key in any way possible,  using your own blocks or an opponents to get your knights up high and score the big points.

The first time I played this, I didn't like it that much, however the 2nd time was pretty fun.  It's an interesting game with decent strategy and a bit of luck.  It also has a take that kind of element that I didn't realize at first.  The rules are not too bad to learn and the helper cheat sheet is very handy.  Some of the actions can be a bit confusing on when to play them, however after a game play or two, they will become apparent.  Especially when you see an opponenet use them to their fullest power.  The game is worth a game play and to be considered in playing from your collection of games.

Torres is a nice logical progression for the classic Kramer AP mechanic.  Unfortunately, it's way too mathy and often bogs down into serious AP (the other kind) grinding the game to a painful procession.  The cards were also a bit too chaotic in that some were really good, some not so much, and a few ridiculously awesome.  In the game I played I actually could've won in the final move, but instead chose to quickly execute my turn in hopes of speeding it along.  I guess multiplication tables aren't my strong suit in regards to longterm logistical planning...

Very interesting game. I liked it quite a bit and would like to play it again. Essentially you are trying to build castles that occupy the as much surface area as possible and get your knights as many levels up on those castles. I like action point games for the most part and this one is definitely one of my favorites. There are three scoring rounds, one after your first 4 turns and 1 more each after every third turn after that. Each of your knights scores are calculated by multiplying the surface area (the number of squares the castle covers) by the number of levels your knight is above the ground. Enjoyable level of player interaction (at least in my game). Cool game and fun!

I wanted this, like so many other games, but held off because I thought it would be a really heavy game, like Tigris & Euphrates (which I've had for 4 years and haven't played), but after reading the rules for Torres and testing it out, I like it, it isn't a brain fryer.  Have only 3 real games under my belt, but I can see the potential, and I relieved that my 8 and 12 year old kiddies can play it quite well. 08/08***My 12 year old loves this game, wants to take it on vacation with us...box too big for that!

Best of the Kramer action point games I've tried (haven't tried Mexica).  This simpler sibling of Java & Tikal is stripped down to basics and in my opinion plays better because of it.  However, variety can be added through the official variants regarding the use of action cards and through the use of the "Master" scoring cards so it seems unlikely that this games "simplicity" will lead to a lack of replayability.  While the game itself is arguably more abstract than its brethren, it does not suffer much because of it and the 3D plastic castle pieces are actually more evocative than the tiles of the other games.

RATING: 7
initial rating 

Another good AP game from the Master but I am somewhat disappointed as I was expecting a little more. After playing many of Kramer's games including the other AP games Tikal, Java and Mexica this seems to lack a little depth and long term planning (I could say theme too but that was no surprise and not disappointing). Now I'm not saying there is NO depth and NO planning as there certainly is but the other games mentioned have more of it IMHO, you still chart a bit of course and you still have some interesting decisions to make nonetheless. On the plus side it does play faster than Tikal and suffers less from AP. Maybe further playings will open up more paths but it seems there are certain optimal ones here. 

It also feels quite restrictive in certain areas ie. bringing and moving Knights on the board and also screwing with the other players. You can certainly interfere with their growth plans but then they can't do shit about it once it happens which surprised me, there was no such card for this action. There are also times where even with the cards you may not have any really great moves to make which surprised me too. I did like the card play aspect as I felt it would of added to Tikal and at least it let you break down certain barriers and pull off some nice moves. 

Everyone playing/starting with the same cards is a must I would say, why add a luck element when it doesn't need one. Comes in as almost a middle weight really that only takes about an hour to play so it makes a great weeknight game. After seeing what the master cards might add I need to try that...

This was a quick and light game with just my wife and I playing. It's not too deep and not at all confrontational so it might be good for introducing friends and family to gaming.

Update: We played it with three players, this time using the "Master Version" of the rules. The game became deeper, but still light enough for our friend to enjoy it (he's not a gamer). If we play this more, I think my rating will go up.

Another update: I've now played this game several more times with four players and I really like it.

I hope my enjoyment of the game doesn't decline when I lose.  Update2: I lost Game 5 by 1 point because I scored first and someone else later tied me.

RATING: 8
This doesn't come out too often but I enjoy it every time!  K&K at their best with this being an unofficial member of their trilogy of action point system of games (Java, Tikal, and Mexica).

In a 4 player game each player only has 13 turns over the course of the game!  But each turn you have a base of 5 action points to use... each AP could be used to score at least (because of leap frog rule on score track it could be more) 1 victory point so if you end up with less than 65 VP's at game end you've played really badly :)

I've only played the "masters" rules variant once as I'm usually teaching this classic to new players so only use the variant where each player has their own separate shuffled face down deck of action cards to draw from (I find using strict "base" game rules of shuffling all action cards together into a common deck to draw from can be unbalanced and random).

A true classic in board game design.

Let's start with how cool it is to build a three-dimensional structure and wind up with a totally unique landscape at the end of each game. In addition, the design is outstanding - the action point menu gives you precise control, and the cards can *really* mix things up. 

Oh, if you get the chance, grab the older edition with the absolutely gorgeous Alessandra Cimatoribus art.

I found it very similar to Tikal (At the time I played it I had no idea both games were from the same designer) really nice components and as Tikal it has a complete strategic mode variant (with all cards in hand) which I really love. You have so many decisions to make with so little action points, it’s great. I think it is more strategic than Tikal but the theme is a lot worse, at this time I have played only 2 times but I’m concerned about the replay value of the game, it doesn’t seem to be very high. In conclusion I think Torres is a very good game, but I prefer play Tikal over Torres.

Nowadays, I almost never have the compulsion to play Torres, in fact I (almost always) oppose my friends when they try to bring it to the table, due to this I almost never play it. 

I know the game has a lot of depth, its components are great and according to my tastes I should love it, but for some reason I don’t want to play it, I know it is an irrational bias but it´s there :shake:. Playing it is no longer fun.

Usually I'm not one for abstract thinkers - partly because my brain can only plot so far ahead and partly because I like a little bit of story with my games - but I rather enjoy Torres. The card draws add just a wee bit of randomness and help make it less chess-like, and the cool bits and 3-dimensional aspect certainly add a lot of character. My friends are all on the same level of think-iness, so it makes for a fun game. Now, if I had to play a Torres Grandmaster, that would be a different matter. (By the by, I know there is an actual story attached to the game, but it's just... silly.)

This is a great strategic game. To minimize the effect of luck, we play the game so that when taking an action card, you lift three cards, pick one of them and put the rest of the cards on top or under the deck. I enjoy this most as a two player game and don't want to play it any other way.

Solid game rewarding efficiency, timing and clever play.  Each game I have played has been better than the last.  I have yet to try the master rules variant.  The game lasts only an hour but is chock-full of interesting decisions.  I can see how some people might think the game is a little dry though.

Not much wrong with this game, just surprisingly not to my tastes. You've got a few options on your turn for building up castles and placing your knights higher and higher on top of them. You score points for the height of your knight times the base area of the castle. It all works fine, just doesn't engage me.

This game is exactly why Kramer and Kiesling need to design more games together. Like many of their other designs this one has an element of area majority, but with a 3D twist. The players construct the areas as towers whose maximum height must not exceed the number of spaces the castle is spread over. 

There are also action cards which are probably the best implemented action cards I've ever seen. They provide important ways to break the normal rules and are incredibly important to game play. I often feel that action cards are tacked onto games to make them more random and less analytical, but it's exactly the opposite here. The existence of these cards changes the way you play the game because you know your opponents might be able to break the normal rules in very specific ways. This means you must remember which cards they've played and which cards they may be able to use so that you can try to block them.

The game is easy to learn but has such immense depth of play and longevity, I highly recommend it!

By far the best of the action point games from Kramer & Kiesling. The basic game is a lottery that's not worth playing, only play the advanced game. No randomness, but will still play differently every time thanks to the master scoring card and the butterfly effect from early action card plays.

Haven't played many of the variants, or even used the Master Cards yet.  Downtime or A/P really isn't an issue when I've played, so this is a quick, meaty game that always satisfies.  I've found it difficult to catch the leader in the last round, but that could probably be remedied with more experience.

A fairly light abstract game in comparison to its siblings (Java, Mexica, Tikal). If people are complaining about analysis-paralysis, then they have not played Java.

I actually like this one quite a bit, each turn plays fairly quick, there's quite a bit of depth to it and the pieces look really good. Some of the rules are tricky, but I think the game works really well overall.

"Overall, Torres is super! It's a bit on the meatier side, so it won't hit the table as much as some of my shorter games, but it's a solid entry in that area. It has all the things I generally like in a game: a sense of accomplishment after the game ends, a cool type of building, and fairly non-aggressive gameplay. They're all good aspects for a game, even if the theme is a smidge generic (to be fair, this is a fairly old game, so, not totally its fault). It would be nice if the pieces were a bit bigger and had heavier bases (to prevent them getting knocked over as much), but that's not the worst thing in the world, just a bit annoying. If you're looking for a solid, strategic game and you've got 3 - 4 people in your group, Torres is pretty great! I'd recommend checking it out."

fiddly Knight movement rules ruin this nice game for me a bit.

I enjoy this game almost as much as Tigris & Euphrates. One of the best "abstracts" I have played. The third dimension brings a totally different feel to the game though.

I played this with two players, which makes for a different game.  It's a simple concept made complex by the gameplay specifics, which I don't really like as much as a complex concept delivered in straightforward terms, like Caylus.

This isn't to say I didn't enjoy it.  I thought it was a fun little game.  The three dimensional aspect is fresh as is the action point system (for me).  However, once I played through a game I felt as if there wasn't much more depth than checkers or some of the spatial relationship puzzles I used to play as a kid.  I'd like to try it again with more people, but I don't think I'll be compelled to multiple replays.

I like it but didn't really enjoy the feeling of back and forth while trying to build a bigger/higher castle.

I still enjoy the occasional game of Torres though.

I don't know if I'd recommend this game to my friends but I really love it. My favorite aspect is that if you play with a full open hand from the start there is absolutely no luck in the game. It is all about skill and out maneuvering your opponents. So, I really love the challenge. I think the complexity level is rated lower than it should be if you're really looking to master this game. The game seems simple at first but there are so many sneaky little moves that it takes a long time to learn all the possibilities. Even though I've played it a ton and am a very highly ranked player online, there are still moves from others that surprise me. If you are looking for a easy to learn, difficult to master strategy game, this is it!

Card randomness can be frustrating, you might get something that's usable in every game or something only for a particular situation. Don't play with the completely random draw, always use the "personal decks for each player" rule.
Despite being a calculation-heavy K&K action point game it can be fun and plays quick, usually a lot quicker than its siblings Tikal, Java and Mexica, and doesn't drag forever even with multiple AP prone players.
The master rules are intriguing, but the game is still much (or even more) about calculating and optimizing your moves and action points. Doesn't hit the table often. Sold.

Although I really like this game, the feeling that I'm constantly trying to decipher a puzzle on my turn, while being mostly unable to limit my opponent's opportunities, keeps me from rating it higher. [b]7.5[/b]

UPDATE: My earlier criticism has turned around after a few more games. The puzzle solving aspect now seems more welcome as I learn more ways to cut off my opponent's growth while defending my own. Plenty of room for very clever play. I must say that I far prefer the perfect information variant where all your action cards are at your disposal from the beginning of the game. [b]7.5->8.5[/b]

I thought I would love Torres, but it wasn't so great. It's not a bad game, but not very good either. Very dry and abstract + you really need to think your movements.

RATING: N/A
Hard to find (Even Online)

Torres is an abstract game of resource management and tactical pawn movement. Players are attempting to build up castles and position their knights to score the most points each turn. Players have a limited supply of knights and action cards that allow special actions to be taken. Efficient use of pieces and cards, along with a thoughtful awareness of future possibilities, is the heart of this game.

The game is not bad. There is some strategy but it's far from exciting. The master cards are totally unbalanced, don't play with them. Some action cards are pretty useless.

RATING: 9
This is a truly wonderful spatial game that has an almost equal mixture of strategy and tactics.  It plays very well with any number of players, although it is surprisingly different as you move through the scale.

While any of the variants offers a very high replayability factor, the fact that there are so many of them (including several that I have not tried yet, and several that can be found in the game's forum by Fawkes) makes this a game that you can probably play for a lifetime.  I just want to play it a bit more, including some face-to-face, to confirm it.

It would be interesting to see a small expansion that included variant Action and Master cards, plus possibly a larger board for a different 4-player experience.

UPDATE: This is the very definition of a 10 for me. I will play it any time, in any variation (except possibly the single draw deck variant, although I might be convinced). So, a 10 it is.

UPDATE: Huh. My last comments notwithstanding, I now think I was a little hasty bumping Torres up to a 10. I can't quite put my finger on why I've cooled on it, but I think it may have to do with the dominance of the "two tower lock" - both creating one and cracking them when you get the chance.

Back to a 9 for now.

Update: after a few plays, she started to like it. We agree that the game will be more fun with more players. Haven't tried the master version yet. But will try soon.

Not for the spacially challenged. I don't have that problem, so this game is great for me

I prefer the newer version; sue me (I have the newer version). The old terra cotta looking towers just looked completely fake to me.

I liked this game a lot.  It was simple in its rules, but allowed for a lot of (sometimes too much) thinking for each turn.  Games where you lay down things always amaze me, since I look at them at the end and think, "wow, this suddenly looks cool..."

A nice game of action point optimization and has interesting dynamics with more players involved. Building on your position, and butting into the other castles and other players' plans drive the game.  Ingenious moves to block and overcome blocks make this game satisfying.  However, it does take a long time to play through (the 60 minutes listed on the box is nothing like accurate, more like 2-3 hours) and the repetitiveness begins to wear before the game is officially over.  It comes out once in a while, but not more often than that.

An abstract game where you have cards that allow you to place castle pieces.  You are trying to build them up and move knights onto them to score the most points.  A clever strategic game.  It is deeper than it looks on the surface.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A great action point game.  I prefer this to Tikal, as it seems to move along a bit quicker, even if it has a slightly drier theme.  The artwork on the original is great.  I haven't compared it to the reprint yet.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I was told since I am a fan of Tikal and games like it that Torres would be something I would like and I was told correctly. Maybe action points just click for me plus I like most any game with a 3D element that you can build up.

Entertaining, family-friendly puzzle game with very appealing components and a light theme.  Strong use of the cards is recommended to get the most out of the game.  Scales well from 2 - 4.

RATING: 7.5
One of my few abstracts.  This game is all about stacking towers and scoring victory points.  One of the best things about this game is the way the towers look on the board at the end.  It creates a very beautiful castle formation that is unique each time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Good abstract strategy game, though it is more a tactic game than a strategic. It is good fun as well if you like 3D games with a load of interaction. Tactics come in handy since the game board changes continiously during the game and each time you have to maximze your outcome. The various special cards make long time strategies hard to establish since other players can interrupt your buildings in ways that you cant plan for. 
Rules are easy and set up quick, replayability high since no game will look like another. 

Better with full rules where you play with all special cards at hand (or face up) since it removes the randomness of the game you get by drawing from a pile.

Zunächst bekommt jeder Spieler vier Stapel mit je zwei Stockwerken als Vorrat. Außerdem warten sechs Ritter darauf, in einen Turmbau geschickt zu werden. 
Wer am Zug ist, kann fünf Punkte verbrauchen. Damit stockt man Etagen in den Burgen auf, bringt Ritter ins Spiel, lässt eine Figur von Burg zu Burg wandern oder auch um eine Ebene höher klettern. Und darauf kommt es an. Die Punkte, die jeder Ritter einheimst, errechnen sich aus der Grundfläche der Burg mal der Zahl der erklommenen Stockwerke.

Очень давно приглядывался к этой игре, и вот она побывала в моих руках.
Море положительных впечатлений получаешь от одного только внешнего вида игры. Прямо у тебя на столе растут башни нового замка.
В этой игре есть и стратегия, и тактика. Можно даже некоторую политику вести (если уметь договариваться). Можно попытаться подло захватить то, что отстроили соперники.

We've enjoyed this game a lot. I don't usually like games with "wild" cards , but they work well here since everyone has the same set to manage. It's great fun to be able to "steal" someone's castle from them. I love the challenge of trying to build up a castle while denying access to your opponents. This is a game that works well with more players.

[b]Update:[/b]  Having played this for over a year now, it's not a regular item, but one that everyone in the group enjoys.  We definitely prefer the new version to the old just for looks.  A lot of fun, even though it does lead to AP now and then.

[b]2015-05-09 9.1[/b] from 8.5 after masters rules
[b]2015-11-19 9.8[/b]* from 9.1:
Definitely one of my favourite games as it is unlike any others. It is a simple building game but everyone's building can be scored by each others' strategically placed knights. You not only used your knights to score, but to also block others from getting on a higher level than you. The masters rule takes away the randomness and gives a challenging big-points scoring condition for end game. You'd think the funky pattern is impossible but often players can manage to find a way to meet that demanding criteria. Such an awesome game. 9+ because of building but -0.2 from 10 for the little bit of scoring additions each round.

One of the most enjoyable abstract strategies in my book, because of the many different paths you can take, it offers more variety than the other major players in this genre. On top of that you can form the game to your style of play, allowing more or less luck in there, and opposed to many abstracts it supports 2-3-4 players well.

Haven't had a desire to play this one too much. I think it takes too much brain power and isn't that "fun". For a little more/less effort (familiarization etc) I'd rather play chess.

Game in a Nutshell: Score points in this masked abstract by spending action points to be as high as you can get on the broadest based castles.

Played as: 4 player

Pros: Simple premise that should make for fast moving games of good interesting choices where managing your knights, building out versus (and in conjunction with) up, on top of controlling your area makes each action point critical.

Cons: Should be fast and will be fast might not line up always. The game would be great at 30 minutes and can be mind-numbing past an hour. The action cards are nice but it's a luck element that can't be planned for or mitigated against; just draw and hope for the best.

Other: It's hard to say what it is that causes little to click in the game that would excite people to crave this... as is, it's both brilliant and fun but sorta a yawn.

Best Use: A quick strategic-puzzle game to be avoided when AP-prone people are around.

I shouldn't like the game. It has some things I don't like, such as many action points to spend in a turn and a 'theme' so barely there it might as well be abstract. 

But I do like it. I think it's clever and it's highly interactive in the way that players sponge off each other. It looks like the game is wide open, but really it's not too overwhelming because you only have 5 action points each turn, and you don't want to do anything that will set up your opponents too well, so that narrows the range of options down to something quite manageable. I don't love it enough to want to play it often, but I hope to get a few more games in from time to time.

Only played "basic" version. Lots of strategy and tactics and interesting decisions to choose from. No randomness (except for card-draw action) which leads to analysis paralysis with the wrong player; otherwise this should play fairly fast. From the sound of it, "advanced" version is even better, would like to try it.

"The Master's Rules for Turn Order, Master Bonus Scoring, and especially the Action Cards make the game sing .. Having those 10 action cards available removes all elements of chance from the game, and is completely deterministic .. Great great game at all player counts, but best played with players at a similar skill level."

RATING: 4
I really liked Torres the first time I played, and maybe I should try it again with 4 players. But at other player counts it's been so unsatisfying that I can't really imagine it being that much better at any number. Moves seem obvious, a constant tit-for-tat, particularly with just two players. With more, there's a little bit more going on with blocking, but this game is also prone to serious analysis paralysis, which makes every additional player the potential cause of serious downtime. At this point, my interest in playing this again has diminished to near zero.

The castles are cool, but you get those in Arkadia, a considerably better game.

I really expected to like this more than I did. Torres is a fine enough abstract game, but it's definitely not one of my favorites. I like it a lot more than Santorini, which looks very similar, but is a lot more simplified. I guess the overall flow of the game just feels a tad restrictive to me. You can only score certain things after each round, and there are only enough cards to where you want to play one on each of your turns, or else you'll miss out. When it comes to abstracts, I still think Indigo and Hive are the best ones out there.

Sometimes you play a game that is so simple and elegant that you wonder why nobody thought of it before. You simply build castles and try to get your knights in as high positions in it as possible. Your score is simply the area times the height of your knight. The addition of a King that offers extra points and cards that offer extra abilities give just enough uncertainty. The good-looking castles that rise from the board literally offer an extra dimension to Torres.

Torres is an interesting game that has a lot of difficult decisions to make. The scoring system is very interesting, and the movement rules are very cool.

My big problem with Torres is the action point system.  In theory, it should work really well.  The different options you have on your turn really make for all the difficult decisions.  The problem is that it takes every player, not just those prone to analysis paralysis, a real long time to make their move.  Because there is very little hidden information, each player has a lot of information to analyze.  This makes the game really drag, as it has a lot of down time between turns.  This makes the game basically unplayable for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Excellent. I keep calling Torres my Eurogames "Love at first sight". So few action points to do so much! This game is so perfectly designed, and each time you play you feel you are learning new things about the game.
Replayability value is low, even though, I love this game.

Supposedly this was designed to accomodate six players, but it was published for four. You would need two sets and make a board that is one row and one column bigger.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great little game in which players must balance building towers and moving their Knights into them to score points (based on the height and surface area of the towers).  All kinds of blocking maneuvers and player interaction; but limited action points and tower supplies each turn that must be spent wisely!  Would love it more if the math/scoring aspect didn't scare people off... :-P
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Right up my street, but doesn't work with two. If the two are evenly matched, then turn order becomes crucial, and since there's no catch-up mechanism, you have a huge advantage if you go second. I'd go as far as to say it's broken with two!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Almost free-form abstract game in which players spend action points each round to both claim castles and expand them. Extremely well-designed, with surprising moves possible thanks to the slew of special action cards that one gets, this appeals to more than just those who typically like abstract strategy games. Probably the best action point allowance game...

Every turn you have a certain amount of towers you can bring out and cards that you can play.  Scoring happens three times during the game and depends on where your knights are sitting.

RATING: 6
(I own the older edition of the game)
Torres is an action point allocation game without luck (when using advanced rules). There is a paper thin theme but you can call this one abstract. It's all about using your resources (knights, cards) better and more efficiently than opponents. Might be best when played with 3 players but 4 is okay as well. Personally I don't like to play this type of games with just 2 players. The game gets naturally more crowded with four and in last phase there will less room for manouvers. The game is goodish but there is nothing special in it.

Torres is one of those games that can take a looong time with AP-prone players... 

The game is a bit too abstract and a bit dry. Mechanically it works rather well but I don't have too much motivation to get it at table.

RATING: 10
Torres has Tikal as an obvious foundation, but it tackles all of its flaws. It uses the same basic mechanism (using up points in different ways for scoring at evaluations during the game) but this time the (limited) turns are reasonably short (no analysis paralysis), the movements are way more flexible (especially when the towers get higher... three dimensions are always nice) and the players can annoy each other a bit more. A luck element can be implemented here as well (playing without random card draws does alter the pace of the game!). As for the strategy, there isn't much brain burning - the tastiest bits of the board become clear relatively soon, so that the play gets cutthroat just afterwards. The downside of it is that turning the tables after a quicker player has reached the biggest castle is not that easy.

Torres is an absolute treat - several ways to move forward (especially at the beginning), not just area but volume control (!) and frequent difficult decisions within a tight (temporal and spatial) frame absent in the mask trilogy make this fairly complex game the best of the Kramer-Kiesling output in the wake of El Grande.

Astrattone dalla profondità incredibile, ormai un classico che ha nella grafica il suo punto debole. Componenti e meccancihe invece sono molto belle. Offre molte possibilità di esser giocato, soprattutto per quanto riguarda la gestione delle carte (A pesca, tutte in mano, mazzi divisi ecc.)

RATING: 4.5
Torres is about as non-abstract as abstract strategy games go, and full kudos to the designers for doing their best to shoehorn in a theme, albeit a hardly original one. The Master version is definitely the way to go, as the basic game has very little lifespan. Lots of bean-counting is a bit of a bore.

Anyway, it's entertaining and short, no doubt. But it's not the game I need on my shelf.

I like the back and forth nature of this game.  Scales well from 2-4 players.  The rules could have been a little clearer, but they aren't that bad.

It's a really fun game with loads of options per turn that plays fairly quickly.

RATING: 7
A very interesting concept and play mechanism with building castle upward and outward. (Scoring depends upon height and expanse of a castle.) The number of turns and scoring phases had us a little confused. I am still not sure we are doing it right, but the game was fun. The limit of only action card per turn feels too rigid. We are considering allowing 2 cards per turn as a house rule and then see how the game plays. I feel that expanding this action card play option can really add to the "spice" of the game. Serious gamers will take this one very seriously. Down time between your turns can be more than you might think. Still a solid "7" in my book.

Wonderful abstract game using action point, and cards with neat powers.  I like the fact that you don't have enough turns to use all your cards but each power is useful in it's time and place.  This one can take a couple of plays to get a feel, but it's certainly worth it!

Fun but the most AP-prone game I own. With the wrong players it can be 15 minutes before you go again. The cards are great but just add to the gameplay time.

I like this one but not when I'm feeling anxious about getting several games into an evening. Feels like more work than the endgame is worth. Very mathy.

RATING: 7
Not one of my favourites as it's very abstract, thinly themed, suffers 'newbie' syndrome, and the importance of seating order and the advantage of going last in the last round where you don't have to protect anything is too high. Despite its problems and the uneven pace of the game over the 60 minutes it takes, it does take a certain skill to play well and so it provides a decent challenge. But I confess to preferring more theme, being happy to leave abstracts to the 2 player games.

Strategy tends to be building up your starting castle as much as possible, then attempt to gain points from the work others do on theirs. At the same time, attempt to score the King Bonus while keeping others from doing the same. In a two player game, some of the action cards are less useful, so it is a bit random as to whether drawing one will help.

You never have enough moves! A good sign, since your decisions are so important in each turn. You need to build up the castles on the board and try to get your player pieces to the top of those castles. But as everyone is doing the same, you get blocked and many people migrate to the larger castles. A great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
 A wonderful game featuring tactics/strategy and 3 dimensional spatial skills.  Some say the theme is thin at best, but you are actually building castles.  True, the rules governing the movements of your six knights make it an abstract strategy game, but the building aspect of the game is fun and looks quite impressive as the game progresses.  There is some number crunching in the game (multiplication and addition) as well as some basic geometry that might be a put off for some, but I actually like this aspect of the game.  The game is best with 3 or 4 players and is a bit too open for 2 and hence lacks a bit of tension for a 2 player game.  However, the game lends itslef extremely well to variants which make the game quite fun for a 2 player.  See "Fawkes Variants" for some ideas.  I particular like his idea of placing poker chips on the board in 3 square L-shape groups that serve as mudholes on which castles cannot be built. The included Master objective cards add considerable variety.  With all these options available, I cannot see the game ever becoming scripted.
If I have to give it a negative, I would have to say the spaces on the scoring track are annoyingly small.  The solution would have been for the track to simply be 0 to 99 and players keep track of how many times they wrap around.

Simple rules, very abstract and brainy gameplay. It's not a game everybody will enjoy, but with the right group of gamers, it can be a very tense and rewarding experience. It's prone to AP so it can't be played with everybody, but I think that's the price to pay when you want to play games of this type. The 3D aspect of the game, the unique gameplay, the quality components and the multiple variants out of the box make it very worthwhile.

Spiel des Jahres... this game?!
A friend gave me a piece of advice before the game: don't play this. At that moment I realized one thing: listen to your friends!

The game is quite analytical, making it hell to play with AP-prone players (I am prone to AP, as was couple of others too in this game, ~2,5h it took). There are so many options and no random choices. Also the number of action cards (10) takes its toll of the playing time.

The components are quite ok. I don't like them but they're informative and clear, so at least I don't have to say anything bad about it. 

Oh and by the way, that king character seems a bit useless in my opinion. Ok, it localizes the play and gives the focal point for the eye, but oh god it's just stupid way of benefiting the last player more than he/she should be helped.

Let me give you a piece of advice: Don't try this game at home!

Really a 9 rating for 2 players and an 8 for 3 or 4 players.  Once you start drawing all 10 action cards over the course of the game, the luck factor seems much less than at first.

One play (4P). Played the master version w/ all action cards and a master scoring card - I think it would lose something w/o these. As it is, really cool game, different from pretty much everything else I've played. Very tight board space w/ 4. I didn't realize quite how static it would become by phase 2 and ended up squandering my 7 pt card as well as the opportunity to score the master points. Lots of tactical "moves" to be discovered that certainly reward replay.

I really like this game. It plays like a multidimensional version of Go in a way. This game uses action points well, though I think it could have done a littler better job creating tension. There are hard decisions, but it’s not disastrous if you make the wrong one. The two player game is just as fun as the four player, which is quite rare. The Master cards add a nice twist when you want a change from the normal game, but nothing great.

Where have you been all my life? I know I've held you in my hand, why didn't I take you home? Three games on Yucata and I can tell I love you, Torres!

Three-dimensional abstract, with cards that allow for unexpected moves. The beauty is that scoring each building is a product of surface and height (and you can't increase height beyond the surface area). This means you can't simply take the action that gives you the most points each turn. Going from 1x1 to 2x2 isn't much, but if you don't do that, you'll never get to 8x8. Then you have to consider two costs: the number of actions, and the number of blocks are both limiting what you can do. And with every block you place, every knight you move away, you create opportunities for your opponents, but if all you do is piggyback them, you'll always be behind. And how many actions can you spend just to block the other players?

There's a beautiful catch-up mechanism too: a king pawn gives a bonus to everyone on the correct level in his castle. Every player can potentially get the bonus, but the player with the lowest score decides where the king goes, so he or she should have an easier time getting it. This means the other players will have to adapt, and maybe abandon their building/climbing engine to do something on the other side of the board, giving the players with lower scores a chance to catch up.

I love games where your decisions are based on future potential of yourself and others, and not simply on a numeric value of points per action or something similar.

The rules are very simple, and yet in every game I play I'm completely surprised by what my opponents are pulling off. I'm generally happy with the moves I make, think I'm picking the right one out of all the possibilities, but I've yet to win a game, so I'm still missing a lot of potentially better plays.

Torres is a tight game, with a great balance between freedom and constriction, between building something and blocking opponents, with simple rules and non-obvious decisions. I can't think of many multiplayer games with Torres's level of player interaction. One of the best games I've ever played.

This is one of the top zero-luck strategy games and one of my all-time favorites. The action point system is genious and allows only the player who uses his limited actions most effectively to win. Much more tactical than Tikal and without the luck factor of that game. Tough choices on every turn. Strongly recommended for those who like abastract strategy.

This is an abstract game where players use an action points budget to build and position their meeples on assemblages of beautiful plastic castle-piece stacks. It's very tactical, as you are rewarded in victory points for having your guy at the highest point of the structures. I love how players can try to steal each other's buildings or set off on their own and start something new, or both.

First 4 player game. Except for needing to understand the cards on the initial outing, play is reasonably fast. Lots of room for strategy and tactics. 1st round scoring is relatively unimportant so onboard development may be the inital priority. An 8 rating is a bit generous but I did find myself thinking about the game some hours later, which is a good thing. It is possible that a weak player could really skew the outcome and thereby give the appearance of a lesser game.

[b]Quick View:[/b] Torres is a fun puzzle game.  It's an action point game that gives off the same vibe as Tikal, Java and Mexica.  It is one of the simplest however.  Less prone to analysis paralysis of Tikal and Java.  Torres is much more of a tactical game where players simultaneously seek to expand their own options while block opponents.  It's very puzzle like and abstract.  It involves much geometrical thinking.

[b]Review:[/b]Supposedly the kingdom has been destroyed by dueling wizards and the king needs his sons to rebuild it.  That's Torres' theme and it is a reminder that not all themes are created equal.  From a game play standpoint players have a stock of knights and towers.  Each turn players can spend 5 action points to expand castles and place knights on the board.  After a set number of turns there is a scoring round with a total of three scroing rounds in the game.  A knight in a castle scores points based on the product of how high he is and the area of the castle.

Castles can't be any taller than their area so the game is about expanding castles outward and upward and getting knights as high up as possible.  Blocking is another important aspect of the game.  Knights block each others' movement and limit castle expansion.  So not only are players expanding castles, they are expanding them in such a way to limit each others' access to them.  This makes for a great deal of interaction.

There is a certain amount of puzzling out moves every turn.  Things can change drastically from one turn to the next, so often players will spend the first part of their turn thinking things through.  The puzzle part of the game is probably one of the best things about it.  The game is played with special action cards which keep the game from being too dry.  The ability to move through tunnels for only one action point makes movement options more interesting as the game progresses.  Additionally there is a set of "Master" cards and accompanying rules to play an advanced variant of the game so it's like it comes with a free expansion.  And I haven't even mentioned the king!

January 2017: Played the master version with all the variants (players have all ten action cards, players play eight tower tiles anywhere to start the game), and played with gamers who knew how to defend huge castles. Awesome, tense game! Raised rating from 5 to 8!

April 2006: Note that I don't like area influence games to begin with. Strict building rules make it hard to attack an opponent who has managed to build a huge castle.

UDAPTE: You should tell beginners beforehand the tactic you must prevent opponents from doing to prevent runaway leaders (you should all know what tactic I'm talking about).

The more I play this game, the less I like it. All you're doing is simply getting to the top of all the castles, preferably the bigger ones. There are no other strategies.

Fun, clear goals, yet very tough to see how to accomplish them.  I'd definitely play this again, but only on a very sturdy table.  Every move gives you hundreds, perhaps thousands, of choices to make, and there are very few 'obvious' moves that are clearly better than all possible alternative combinations.  The vast number of strategies to weigh, with possible counter-moves by your opponents, gives Torres great depth with a reasonably simple set of rules.  The right amount of player interaction, and a variant that can eliminate all luck for those so inclined.  Wonderful game!

A very good game based on the Action-point system used in many other games designed by these two men. You advance upwards too, and after some turns the board is full 3d and stunning! As usual in these kind of games, so much to do, but your hands are tight (only 5 AP), so expect painful decisions!
I like these guys:)

I originally imagined each piece would have a tetris-like shape, so the building is less interesting than I hoped.  The moving about is OK, but it is hard to block anyone.  Can be prone to terrible analysis paralysis.

The building mechanic is interesting and I like the scoring mechanisms here.  That said, the game just doesn't grab me or seem "fun" when I'm playing it.

I have not played Torres in a long time. I have to see how this holds up against modern games. Since you have quite some action points during your turn, this should really feel different with all the modern "Your turn - do one action!" games. Since I love spatial elements in games, I should still enjoy Torres today.

An abstract game with lovely components and I enjoy the 3D aspect of this game, even though I mostly have played it online in 2D recently.  I do find it quite a brain-burner, but I enjoy it when I play it.  Definitely suffers from analysis paralysis, though in trying to optimise your 5 actions points per turn and play your cards effectively.  Not a lot of luck, despite the cards.

Played with two and went very well.  A lot of room to expand, rating will most likely go up with more players.  Will make space and positions much more scarce (and fun).  UPDATE: Have played with more, rating stays the same.  Too much analysis paralysis between turns to make this an 6 or a 7, but still ok.  I also like the way that the designers made different levels of play with cards, goals, and such.  It makes the game grow with the experience of those playing.

At first I thought it was great - an elegant design. Now I think - it's as much calculatory work as chess, but without the interesting dynamic interplay of pieces and action - just lots of number-crunching and imagining different positions for slight edges in points. 

It's OK with all the amusement and interactivity of El Grande. Torres - I'd rather play chess.

Some of the random-draw cards in this game are too powerful (e.g. the "Teleport" card).  If you don't get into the right place at the right time, you can be in big trouble.  Getting in with the king is sometimes not as useful as building the tallest tower in the largest castle.

Torres is great! It's hugely satisfying to see the progressive build up of the board; it gives a nice constructive feeling. There are many strategies  revolving around the different action cards, and since everyone starts with the same choices, it's interesting to see how the game develops. Brilliant plays near the end of the game come from everyone, even those who claim they are not good at strategy. 

One of the best parts of the game is that despite the richness of gameplay and fun factor, it finishes in just one hour. Largely so that you can play again!

Definitely plays better with the optional rule that allows each player to have all of their action cards at the beginning of the game (rather than drawing them during play for 1 AP). The red "Master" cards are a nice addition, but the effort needed to satisfy most of the cards seems to outweigh the point values.

Options are limited enough on your turn to keep this moving at a decent pace, but varied enough to keep it interesting. I do miss a real theme though - even if it is a thin one like Tikal and Java. Cards keep things unpredictable. Gets an extra point for making the most of 3D.

Easy rules.  Relatively quick to play.  Tactics rule the day and a host of choices to be made.

Even though is abstract, I don't find it dry and it is really quite lovely at the end of the game with all these castles cluttering up the board.  It starts taking on more theme as the game progresses and your fat little knights are running around the growing castles trying to outmaneuvre each other.

Good with both 2, 3 & 4 - although things become a lot more crowded in a 4er where you can't help but get in each others way (which I happen to like).

RATING: 6
Pieces and board looked neat (1st ed.). The gameplay is abstract, but I have a soft spot for anything requiring even a bit of 3D spacial thinking. You can block people and mess up their plans, there's an dramaturgy to the game (beginning, middle, end structure) and it's relatively short. Looks vulnerable to AP prone people, though. Thematically less interesting than Tikal, but with more interaction, which is nice. 

Played 2nd time with friends. One of the most friendly thinky games - the objectives are clear, the pieces look great, it's very tactical with people blocking your paths so it evens the playing field. What you're looking at is however an interactive, but silent experience (well you can talk during the game, but the theme itself does not give you a lot to go on). Negative side is that it's very AP prone by design and can get bogged down if people overanalyse their moves (though it's mostly quite clear what you can do, problem being that the player before you changed the situation).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
One of the games Kramer is famous for, and as bereft of real theme as Knizia's Through the Desert. The game rewards long deep thought to an extent.

The basics of strategy in Torres are: adding a piece to the base gives you points equal to your height. Raising a knight gives you points equal to the castle's base. Like any other game, how many points can you gain from your limited supply of actions? For the most part, this is not too challenging. There is usually nothing you can do in one round to end up with more than a relatively obvious move. However, you may be able to plan several moves in advance to cut out an action to gain the same number of points, which leaves you an action free to do something else. 

The game can be enjoyed on the light thinker level, or on the deep thinker planning level. If you like that sort of thing.

More on the puzzle/abstract side. I usually get bored by playing games like this, but this one is very engaging. Five actions a turn can be so much fun to plan and perform. The action cards losens up the system a bit and that creates tension.
And building those towers with actual 3-dimensional pieces makes the game look sweet.

[2 plays] I really have a deep affinity for Kramer's action point style of games. This was one of the last of his big guns in that genre that I tried and I really loved it. More comments after a second play, but I'll sum up by saying that the recent big box version is just beautiful as well as a heck of a fun game to play.

A pretty looking Kramer Action Point game. This one has players using action points to place knights and towers and move them around for scoring. Scoring is remniscent of Java (height x surface area) and there are action cards to 'break' the rules of the game and allows for some nasty plays.

Plays fairly quickly but doesn't have the theme or charm of tikal and even Mexica. The new RGG edition has ugly gray tower pieces.

Csak most sikerült megismerkednem a 2000-es év játékával a Torressel. A játékosok célja minél nagyobb alapterületű és minél magasabb várak építése, ahová jelölőiket próbálják minél magasabb szintre juttatni. A pontozás rendkívül egyszerű alapterület x azon magasság, ahol a jelölőnk áll. Egy toronyért egyszer kaphatunk pontot. A játékban mozgathatjuk jelölőinket és kártyákat használhatunk, amik különböző extra képességeket adnak, az alap akcióinkhoz képest. A játék meglepően gyors, könnyen megérhető a szabálya, de nem túl könnyű játszani. Valószínűleg minden játékosszámmal jól működik. Hogy ne csak dicsérjek pár negatívum. A játékban három pontozási rész van és úgy érzem ha nem is túlságosan, de benne van a játékban a vezető egyre jobban vezet problémája. Tehát nehéz fordítani jó játékosok esetén. Továbbá eléggé egyértelmű, hogy kivárni kell és a másik hibáját kihasználni. Nehéz újat alkotni benne, főleg olyat, amit az ellenfél ne tudna valamilyen szinten kihasználni. Tehát nekem nem tűnik túl sokutasnak a győzelem. Ettől függetlenül tetszett a játék, meg is érdemelte valószínűleg az év játéka címet akkoriban. 6-ost adok csak rá, de ez egy erős hatos.

Doesn't hit the table much any more, but it still remains one of my favorite games.  Builds up to be an intense tactical ditty, with just enough theme to make this abstract something really fun.  This is one of the first games where I really started appreciating the whole concept of "too many things that you would like to do, not enough ways to do them".

UPDATE: Even if I only get this out once or twice a year, I still get a kick out of it, what a fantastic game.

Full disclosure -- I thought I wouldn't like this game.  Surprise!  It was fun.  It's got the action points going and there's no conflict at all, but there's still creative ways to have fun and score points.  Board looks beautiful afterward as well.  I have enjoyed the plays but not enough to feel the need to keep it around.

I dislike the language-independent cards and icons. (Would it kill them to print three or four different decks with words on them in different languages? I'd pay an extra couple of bucks per game for that--as long as they kept the font large.) Some of the cards have a few extra things you need to look up.

I played a 2-player game and enjoyed it. I can see where players could take forever analyzing their options and cause the game to drag. (Timed turns might be a good option.) With two players, it seemed difficult to block the opponent from taking advantage of your castles--a player seems able to defend only one of them from cherry-picking.

But I just don't find I want to play it all that often any more.

I've played this several times both f2f and online with all numbers of players and this is an incredible area-control game.  There are many ways to interfere with your opponents' plans, the cards give you a chance to surprise your opponents when they try to interfere with your plans, and the scoring makes sure there are no ties.  I haven't decided which version of card-draw I like best:  all cards in hand or draw 3-choose 2.  Both are excellent; it just depends on my mood.

I like all four AP-games by Kramer & Kiesling, but this one is my favourite. Some find it too dry, I think of it as a very elegant game without excess chrome (which I always dislike). Haven't played with the master cards yet, but the advanced version where everybody gets his own set of action cards (but you still have to pay for them) is entertaining enough.
When played with quick players, this should never last any longer than 60-90 minutes. Unfortunately, most of my regular fellow gamers are prone to AP, so I don't play this as often as I would like.

How can you not like a game that is all about building castles and having your knights sneak unexpectedly into your opponents' castles?  It's certainly a fun little strategy game that brings to mind "Tikal" (and with good cause, seeing as it was designed by the same guys and produced by the same company).  It has less luck than "Tikal", although the theme is definitely weaker in "Torres" and the physical game less visually appealing.  The plastic castle-building pieces are certainly top-notch, but the rest of the bits are fairly average for a Euro-style game.  I really need to find some plastic knights somewhere to replace those wooden tokens!  This is a great pick if you're looking for a fairly simple yet strategic multi-player game, but for a game that employs this sort of action-point mechanic, I would more often pull out "Tikal".  And the optional advanced cards are "take it or leave it", although they certainly alter the game.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 6.5/10

RATING: 7
A 3D tile placement game where players score for having knights on castles: specifically, each castle the player has knights on scores the surface area of the castle times the height of that player's knight knight furthest off the ground. There is additional scoring from the king and from scoring cards.

It's pleasant, though as an action point game it does have all the possibilities for analysis paralysis that usually implies. There is also surprisingly strong interaction because castles are not owned. If you build yourself an enormous palace, the bastards you're playing will be more than pleased to move in.

In practice, I tend to find the game is generally less satisfying than it could be. Lack of exclusive ownership makes it very difficult to build without creating opportunities for other players, but at the same time there isn't really scope for emergent alliances or similar because players don't want to expand castles where they don't have an advantage. There's just a lot of tedious defensive posturing.

RATING: 7
[RGG 2000 edition] {Building, Kingdom; action-point, area-control, pattern-building} {7 basic, 7 card variant, 7 master variant} Torres is an outstanding game. The action-point system is intuitive and effective that players can understand most of the rules from the summary card. Theoretically, there are only 3 paths of scoring in the basic games; however, the system makes it agonizing to decide how to maximize scores; usually a player wants to do more than 5 action points in a turn. Therefore, Torres is vulnerable to analyze-paralysis and not all players can manage it well.

Torres is a no luck game and is unforgiving. It's not easy to catch up when a player is lagging behind after he made several bad moves.  Torres encourages an aggressive play. It is confrontational; players have to consistently compete for space and position.

I usually played with the variants to have better control - each player has his own set of action cards and he can select 1 from the top 3 cards. 

The Master variant provides another way to play the game. However, I don't think it adds much depth to the game. It's not easy to score those high-score Master cards because the pattern can be easily blocked by other sensitive players.

Another example of why hidden special action cards make otherwise boring games awesome (see Evo and Agricola).

Fairly interesting game, but the game suffers from the "run away leader" design and seems to cause a lot of analysis paralysis in some gamers. Also, it seems that in a 3-player game whoever the lowest player "picks on" will lose the game. Should only be played with 4.

Bit like Stephenson's Rocket: very tactical and could be very satisfying when played by skilled players.

Abstract game about getting your dudes on the most scoring spots. Buying action cards can throw a wrench into plans but that's it. Your opponents decide the difficulty but I wonder where the FUN is.

Somehow reminded me of Acquire seeing the blocks of castle grow. But no stock investments, hostile takeovers etc. Thus less interaction.

The king giving extras reminded me of El Grande, Maharaja: induces an element about maneuvring around this king to maximize your point grabbing. But El Grande has a very cool area controlling aspect, Maharaja looks nice and is family friendly.

In the end, a gamers game that is just too dry and will never get played because there are so many other better games. Pass.

I only have three games of this under my belt, but I can definitely see how this could be more dynamic with 3-4 than with two (at least, my two 3-player games were much less "follow-the-leader" than my one 2-player).  A bit on the dry side, and I would usually choose Tikal over this just for the theme (although, beyond the action point system, the two games have nothing in common), but for what it is, Torres is perfect.  It is the right length - never feels to short/long - and the cards add a nice layer of strategy.  We always play with all cards in hand, mainly to remove the luck factor involved in drawing them (although I can understand the reasons people cite for playing with the normal rule - valuing the cards a bit more since you paid for them, and adding a bit of press-your-luck-ness).

This is a fun action-point game, along the lines of Tikal.  The master rules, in which all of the players have all of their action cards available from the beginning, allow the players to plan ahead a bit more and they eliminate a lot of the "bad draw" aspect of the game.  Since knights can move through castles, some very dynamic and unforeseen maneuvers can take place which makes the game very exciting and unique.  I think this one may move up in my ratings as I play it more.

Torres looks like a children's toy but the 3D element is fully-used, both in gameplay and scoring.  In fact, this is the most successful implementation of the third dimension I've ever seen.  Very deep, very different, very enjoyable.

RATING: 5
This is an OK game, but not the most fascinating.  I think you really shouldn't play with pre-assigned cards, it makes the game less interesting (fewer choices to make) and reduces the risk in a game that should have more risk (the most exciting moment of playing is when I was close to winning but couldn't quite win directly.  So I paid to get two cards and thought of an ingenius way to use them to win).

This is an excellent 2-player game that scales up to 4 players nicely.  The array of options in this game is staggering.  The different strategies that you can employ for using your 5 Action points each turn makes the game extremely interesting and engaging.  Luck plays a very small role in this game, and can be essentially eliminated through a rules variant suggested in the instructions.  Finally, it's very nice that the game comes with an "expansion" by including a set of Master Cards to use once you've played the game a lot.Purchased: July 30, 2005

Interesting and tough game. At the start I had a very difficult time finding any valuable plays, and it seemed that anything I did would just set up an opponent rather than myself.

Not sure why I keep coming back to this one.  The cards seem tacked on but also essential for some tactical shots.  I like this game.  It's best with four.  Good for kids.  Something draws me too it.  

Try to get in on the work that other players did.  Spend your actions to help yourself and get more out of their work than they get out of yours.  

Don't play with the master variant thing.  Just the cards in hand.  Or maybe no cards atall.

2 player is brutal.  I have one guy we play with and have tied 3 times.

  Very good concept. The game changes because the King gets moved around by the player with the lowest score. So, there is a chance for that low player to win, even if he is down by a lot in the first round. I like the action cards, and you almost can't have the same strategy each round, because the King changes castles each round. Very good, could get rated higher with more plays.

Action point mechanism is one of our favorites, but this game left us a little dry. Tikal and Java are much better in our book. Still, the game is tight and close, but the optimization is often rather clear cut and can be easily observed. This is less the case for Java and Tikal. Recommended for people who like action point mechanism.

Még valamikor a hobbim kialakulásának elején olvastam előszőr a játékról, a Tikallal való találkozás után.Itt is van akciópont szerinti mozgás és valóban köthető valamilyen mértékben a maszk-trilógiához, de számomra mégis más, nagyon más. Szeretem az egyszerű szabályok nyújtotta mélységét,a játék designt, szeretek egy parti végén ránézni a táblára. Igen intenzív játékélményt nyújt, folyamatos számolással, És mivel a játék közepétől nem 2-t kell 8-al összeadni, hanem 113-at 27-el esetleg kivonni 12 és hozzáadni még 3-at és aztán ezt hasonlóan megnézni a többi játékosra is, szóval minden játéknál átvillan a fejemen, hogy "de jó is lett volna ha adtak volna számológépet is ehhez a játékhoz!!!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Jump straight to the master rules- the basic and intermediate rules are hogwash. Torres provides a pleasant analytical experience for 2-4 players (more players will mean a bit of downtime between turns however). The key is timing the use of your cards, as well as having a presence in all major castles. The kings bonus is an interesting element and the master cards provide variety from game to game. At 90 minutes Torres is just about the right length for this type of game, unlike the vaguely similar Tikal which is a bit long for its own good. Those averse to abstract games beware however, as there's little theme or chrome to be found here.

After a single 4-player game:
Interesting mechanics, but I'm beginning to think I don't like Action Point games.  I felt a combination of overwhelmed with the decision tree and confused at what I was even trying to do...  I'm sure I'd conquer this with more playings, but I think I'd rather play something else.  

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
When I think of games like this, which are primarily abstract, I think of games that reward lengthy planning.  With the action cards, though, it's impossible to make lengthy plans, and nearly impossible to plan a move that will span two turns.  As such, I feel limited in the choices I can make, and feel like the downtime between turns is useless, as you can only do what is your best course of action when it becomes your turn.  I'm not too fond of games like that; I always feel like I'm playing a futile game of catch-up.

Torres is an abstract game of resource management and tactical pawn movement. Players are attempting to build up castles and position their knights to score the most points each turn. Players have a limited supply of knights and action cards that allow special actions to be taken. Efficient use of pieces and cards, along with a thoughtful awareness of future possibilities, is the heart of this game.

Torres is considered by many to be an informal member of the Mask Trilogy.

RATING: 8
Interesting game. A little bit dry, but that doesn't bother me any. Lots of strategic decisions, and I really like that scoring intervals are regular and predictable (unlike the other action point games I've played). The only thing that lost this points is that so far I've only played the "regular" game, and since many cards are only situationally useful, the luck of the draw plays too big a role. I think I'll only play the master game from now on, and this could rise to a 9 or maybe even a 10 with that.

Cons.: in 4 players too much changes when your turn is back
Pros.: all the rest. Interesting, in different ways, in 2,3 or 4 players. Loads and loads of possibilities even with so few pieces. Rules seem difficult at first but if well explained they are easy. You can be creative.

Could be prone to analysis paralysis , right, but i don't care, i like to burn my brain here and wait for the smell of other burning brains. 

Many difficult decisions, backstabbing, surprises, fun fun fun !

Ravensburger English Edition 2001.  Components are in very good condition.  The box has a just very slightly mashed corner and slight whitening on the others.

Have the Rio Grande small green box version.  Have played this twice now.  I like it lots for an abstract.  Like the bits and our first few games have been great.  Have not expanded to the Master cards yet, but will do so down the road.

Good game! Has a risk of AP, since there's a lot of mathematics involved. I like the added card system as well.

Great abstract game with a one-upmanship mechanic, but the abstractness and the action-point system means it is prone to being too thinky for my preference.

I can see why this game won the SdJ.  A lot of fun, trying to figure out how to score the maximum number of points, using your action points wisely, moving knights, building towers.  A fun game that looks great on the table.  Everyone at game night came by to see what we were playing and commenting on how fun it looked, and they were right!

Players compete to rebuild the towers of a kingdom and score points by controlling the highest positions of these towers.  Each turn players have only 5 action points to use for building towers, positioning knights, and choosing valuable power cards.   There is a nice balance of strategy, fun, and player interaction in this Spiel des Jahres winner (2000).

a tenatative 7 at this time...it could go up. have not played at this stage but could be a bit too dry a game for our group allbeit the game mechanic seems well thought out and artwork is aesthetically sound.
220203 - first play! after close to 2 years of owning this game it was played as a 3 plyr and was very enjoyable. bumped it to 8!
..in fact upon reflection, i rate torres a 9. I'd most certainly always want to play a game..there's a lot more tension it seems than similar action point games like mexica...

Played several times (with 2 to 4 players). A very good game with so few action points and so many things to do with them. The scoring system is clever, the action cards are powerful, but not always easy to put in use, and the game (which can be surprisingly short if players avoid analysis-paralysis) stays tense till the end.

No particular complaints that I can remember (as it was a while ago that I played), but it's sat on my shelf ever since and I haven't felt the urge to play again, so there I didn't find anything particularly inspiring in it either.

I love this and kicked everyones ass ( well a bit of a stretch I admit but I did win more than not in the beginning)... now it rarely gets played... damn. A chess like game in the sense that it is beneficial to be able to see several moves in the future. For some reason I was able to do that and I was able to plan and carry out moves that gained me victory often. Now the competition is much greater. Really like this game.

This is my first AS board game. I love it! I was also surprised to find out that my wife does as well. I introduced the game recently to a group of non-gamers (myself included at the moment). Everyone made enough of an investment to really become interested in the game. Afterwards, we were all discussing how much we enjoyed the dynamic between action cards, knight placement, and building. My first impression is that this game could be played with quite a few different strategies.

The artwork on the game board sets the aesthetic tone for this game. The knights are all wooden cones. The action cards and player aid cards are well designed, and convey meaning almost instantly. My only complaint is the plastic castle pieces, which seem a bit cheap compared to the rest of the pieces.

This is the game that has sold me on GASBG's.

While action points are never good for the AP prone... this game still moves pretty quickly and has a lot of interesting decisions.  Its also fulfilling to watch the castles take shape and make some clever moves with your knights.  However while I enjoy the brain exercise of this game I'm not entirely sure how fun it is... mostly thanks to the mathiness of the scoring I suspect.  Still, a strong member of my abstract Euro B-Team.

Torres is a game I appreciate but ultimately did not enjoy.  What really hurts it in my eyes is the lack of actions I can take to interfere and screw with my opponents (especially the leader).  When someone has managed to claim a sizeable territory as well as the highest tower, there is really not much I can do to take that position away from him.

The cards which allow you to break the rules are mostly useful with a couple of exceptions (notably the one that let you jump over another piece).  The fact that they give you such an advantage only made it even more obvious that one of your action points each turn must be allocated to drawing them in order for you to play it next time.

Repetitive and dull, there is very little room for any kind of subtle or clever maneuvers with your knights.  Honestly, I'd rather be playing Through the Desert, a much better tactical abstract in many ways.

Deserving of it's "Game of the Year 2000" win, this game hurts my brain, but in a good way.  Absolutely must play with the variant that you have all the actions cards in your hand at the start of the game; it adds a ton to the game.

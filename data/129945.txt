This game wasn't exactly deep, but it didn't need to be.  The first time that I got it to the table, we had 6 people, a little alcohol and it generated a lot of noise and laughter as people cheered on their horses.  After we finished, a lot of people from other tables commented afterwards about how much fun we seemed to be having and, in the end, isn't that the most important thing?

RATING: 7
This game does make you feel like you are at a horse track, betting on horses, and hoping your horse will win.  As such, this game deserves major praise for being quite thematic, and in a frothy family game sort of way, this game is fun.  What is going to happen?!  Roll the dice, again and again, to see what happens! Which numbered horse will win?!  Roll the dice and find out!  

In the final analysis, a person will likely find this game fun if that person likes betting on races (or loves rolling dice and moving pieces on a board accordingly.)  As for me, betting on races provides, at most, a modicum of fun, so gotta give it a 6.

I was pleasantly surpise on how much fun this game is to play.  I like the way the "race cards" changes things up and the purse for the winner(s).  It made each of the 4 heats/races feel different.  

(plays nice with 2p)

RATING: 6
I prefer a similar game, Long Shot, to this game with the same theme. 

The locked-in nature of betting is less fun than being able to bet mid-race. The fun factor of Long Shot is missing in that this game lacks some of the horse attributes and other things that make that remain a factor mid-race. However, I do like how the race card sets up advantages and disadvantages at the beginning in some ways. 

The races are so short that one cannot get too invested in each race. 

But mostly I dislike the board setup for bets. It's fiddly, and one cannot see the numbers once covered by a first chit. If we had player guides to know what numbers were where, and the ability to record what bids we made (so we don't forget) it would work better. I couldn't remember which horse I bet three on mid-race, or what the payout number was...

While I finally have my copy of TurfMaster, I wanted a quick and fun horse racing game that I could easily play with non-gamers (parents) and HomeStretch fit the bill quite nicely.

It's not something I would recommend anyone go rush out and buy, but given that I could not find a single copy of Long Shot anywhere (the game I wanted), I settled on HS instead.  While it has proven to be quite a hit with my dad (the luckiest gambler in the world, apparently), I still miss the absolute zaniness of Long Shot in comparison.  However, it's not quite fair to compare HS to Long Shot if only because the designer was going for something a little different and in that respect, I believe he achieved it.

This is a simple game of betting, although it lands pretty soft blows instead of horribly punishing you for a bad bet.  You never actually lose any money - if you fail a bet, you simply don't gain anything - and each horse will pay out not only its own place, but the places below it, so there's lots of opportunities to make some bank.  There's also the great idea of paying out owners based on their shares in the horses (so a little math is required here, but nothing too difficult).

In terms of player agency, you simply roll two dice on your turn and the number that comes up is the horse that moves - you can either have it move two spaces (of 10) and pass the dice, or have it move one space and roll again (with your second roll moving two spaces).  Given that there's only ten spaces around the track and no tactical lane changing or anything like that, races go by quick and you will play a series of 4 in 45 minutes or less.  One bonus is that there is no paper money in this game - your money is your VP score around the point track.

Only real issue with this game is once you have a good points leader established, it is very difficult to catch up with them unless they can't follow-up their future bets.  Although there is a catch-up mechanism in that trailing players can hedge more bets on a single horse, it still requires luck to pan out to have that horse payout.

Still, this is a light game that is meant to be enjoyed in a light-hearted fashion so people who need to win their games at any cost need not apply.  This is entirely about simply enjoying the company you're with and yelling at your horses to GET OUT OF THE GATE!#$!$!

I don't tend to like racing games.  I don't always love bidding games either.  I had the honor of playing this game with Frank DiLorenzo enthusiastically, wonderfully playing the announcer, and I've kind of been afraid to play it since, thinking it won't be nearly as fun without someone suited to that role.  But boy, it was a blast!   Try it out.

INITIAL IMPRESSION

horse racing game that has a different bidding mechanic as you are invested in some horses along with your bets each round.

However that's not enough to draw me in and is overall extremely push your luck with not enough ways to mitigate it to your favor

Simply the same as real horse race, players can bid on the horse allotment. Every race is totally different, because horses have various running abilities on each race. It is a almost real horse race game. When the race has begun, everybody starts shouting and fully concentrates to the race. HomeStretch is my favorite horse race game.

HomeStretch is a really fun horse racing game where players not only bet on the horses, but also have a stake in them, pushing their luck and hoping they not only win their bets, but win the race with their horse.  I really like how everyone has their own meta-game going on.  Betting on your own horse and having it win the race nets you a lot of money, but it's not always easy to pull off.  Spreading your bets around actually can work in your favor sometimes, especially if you're behind in the game.  Helping another player to let their horse win if you bet tons of money on it, can surprisingly boost your bank.  All in all, lots of fun and a lot more going for it than a basic "bet on the horses to win" game.

Honestly got this game as an add-on to an order and was really surprised just how fun this was. Basically you buy a share of a horse, roll some dice and see where the horses end up. You can also wager before each race. The game ends after 3 races and the player with the most money wins. So simple yet alot of fun cheering for your horses and you roll and they go around the track.

I haven't played a lot of racing games, but this is my favorite so far. The handicaps add exciting chaos but because you can see them ahead of time, you can make your bets match. Owning horses before the race ensures everybody is invested. Executing four complete races makes for much more interesting tension that is lacking in single-race games like Long Shot that can leave players out of the running if they get too far behind.

Frank DiLorenzo designed this !! Awesome feel to this betting, d6-rolling, horse racing game WHICH ISN'T A ROLL AND MOVE GAME !! Brilliant! Yet another great game from R&R Games. Warning: this isn't a race-to-win game, but rather a horse betting and owning economic game. HOWEVER, players sure do hoot and holler during the race. I've seen young female horse lovers really get into this game!

Fun and tense with 2 players as well. Good scaling from 2 to 6 players. Family Game! Game Group Game! Beer-N-Pretzels Game!

Take time to nail down the betting rules because players falling behind are able to catch up through the added permissible multipliers.

HomeStretch is a simple horse racing/betting game with a roll-and-move mechanism. Odds are put on each horse (numbered 2-12) based on the probability of rolling that number. Certain tracks give bonuses or impairments to different horses. Players draft shares of the horses before the game. After a race, there is a payout to the shareholders of the winner and to players whose win/place/show bets were accurate. It’s a very simple but appealing game system which will work quite well as a family game, or a beer-and-pretzels cheer-fest.

Not that hilariours/fun as Long Shot, but still very enjoyable and fun to play for the nice playing time of 45 minutes. The races during the game can be exciting though. But if you play this, you'll have to except that you'll need some (calculated) luck to win!

RATING: 6.5
1 play, 2er.

Fun game, although 4 races may be one too many? Hard to tell after just 1 game, though. Probably better with more players (although it works pretty well with 2). Also, I wonder if the purse payment should rules should be modified (so you always split the purse by total shares in game, rather than just what players own)? 

The game works well and races can be surprisingly close, thanks to the handicapping system. It's a nice blend of racing and betting, although it sure seems a bit over-produced: a simple 10-space track might actually make game play a little easier!

Rules questions:
- with 2, does the phantom 3rd player earn money for their horses' performance? 
- with 2, does the phantom player draft another horse or two after the first race?
- for betting: does the limit on number of chips placeable on each spot apply only to your own chits, or the total number of chits on that spot?

--- Rules ---
Setup:
- for 2-4 players, use the blue horses; for 5+, add red deck
- place scoring markers on $50K space
- players draft 5 horses, paying costs indicated after done
- randomly choose 2 purple and 2 green race cards (green on top)

Races (x 4):
1. Handicaps. Reveal top race card, place handicap markers (X, +2, +4, and +6 markers) near the horses shown.

2. Place Bets. 
- In score order, high-to-low; except that any player may place bet earlier if they want.
- Place your betting chips (1, 2, 3, 3, 4) face down on the betting table (shows spaces for horses 2-12, each with spots for win/place/show)
- May place up to x chips per spot; x = your rank (score)

3. Race: Reveal top race card
- Starting player = poorest, then clockwise.
- Roll 2d6. Either move that horse 2 spaces and pass the dice OR move it 1 space and roll again (moving that one 2 spaces).
- If you roll a horse that's already finished, move the horse furthest back (if tied, you choose which): instead of 1 or 2 spaces, distance = (die roll - horse number), max 3
- If a horse crosses finish line, place it on betting chart
- Race ends after 3 horses finish

4. Payouts
- Purse (shown on race card): pay to owners of winning horses; each horse card counts as one share
- Bets: 
... winning horses pay to betting chips on the horses' finishing place or lower 
... payout = multiple of betting chip and number on betting chart

After 1st Race Only: 2nd Chance Draft
- Reveal n cards
- In reverse score order (poorest first), may take a face up card (pay cost on card), top card of deck (cost + $3), or pass
- Replenish face up cards, then repeat x 1

End of Game
- After 4 races, player with the most money wins
- Multiple tie breakers

RATING: 6
HomeStretch has some good ideas and has genuinely managed to make a horse race out of a couple of d6, 11 horses, and a short track.  But passing cards around to pick out the horses you'll own doesn't work well, and placing all half dozen of your betting chips on a single turn doesn't work very well either.  Each race takes too long for a whole game to include 4 races.  Still, I have the feeling that with a little bit of tweaking there might be a fun game in here.

Fast-moving horse owning / betting game. Works well with 2, looking forward to playing with more - I'm not expecting play time to increase significantly.

In our first game, it took a few reads to understand the bet payment rules. Is "win / place / show" an American concept, or were we just disadvantaged because neither of us had ever visited a bookies?

Not my kind of game, it's just an effort in rolling dice.  Theres a few little things that I can see that people find enjoyable but over all it's clunky and random.

Enjoyed this quite a bit.  I like games where you can just chuck dice and cheer for a winner.  Like Camel Up, there is no negative to your bettering, which I don't really like.  Unlike Camel Up though, you get ownership over your horses as you purchase stock in them.  Fun, mostly mindless, racing.

I think there is some strategy to it in terms of what horses you buy and how you spread bets. There is also the opportunity for temporary alliances if players bet on the same horses and have common interests. There is some control over horse movement, but handicaps will have a big impact on this. However, despite all this, it is very dice dependent on how well you go. I like the mechanic where horses in last place can get a boost  - sort of simulating a late sprint for the line. Quite thematic.

Now, this is a fast dice fest, or should I say feast. I can see that there's a slight possibility for the game to drag on forever, but it's a slight chance. The game itself doesn't really take a lot of skill to play but still manages to give thata feeling that I'm really pushing my luck here.

From the Reviews: A a cute little game, easy if you want it to be and hard if you want it to be. I like that. I plays with 2 and up to 7 so it also has a group/family aspect to it. 

"Dice don’t have a very good reputation in gaming these days, primarily because a lot of us grew mighty sick of them due to our childhood exposure to designs like Monopoly and Risk. But I think that true dice games, where the gameplay revolves around judging probabilities and pressing your luck, are far too rare a commodity."

It is amazing how someones comment can change an opinion of something.

RATING: 5.5
I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Nice dice-rolling game, easy to play and to carry around. As far as component are concerned, Pickomino presents itself pretty well with good quality wooden dice and very thick plastic tiles. I don't like the artwork instead. It's kinda dull, typical of some older German art-style. 

Gameplay-wise there's not much to tell. It's a very simple dice rolling game and it works good enough for that. Just I think that there's a lot of competition in this genre  at this point and Pickomino, while still being a good filler game, does tend to drag itself out too much. Therefore I would rather play one of its competitors.

Pickomino is a good portable game, even a classic in some ways, but at the same time it's nothing special. A decent way to spend a couple of minutes, waiting for other tables to finish up their games.

Nice components and game idea, but a game of Pickomino - or Heck Meck as our German version is called - is often interfered by lucky or unwanted die rolls. Bad die rolls and you loose a stone. One of you opponents roll the number of your top stone and you loose another one, while it took hard effort to gain it.

A little bit of a brainless game, but occasionally a bit fun.

This game is decent with kids but in relation to all other games I've rated it's really not interesting mechanically. It's basically a push-your-luck dice rolling game and outside of deciding which dice to keep and which to reroll you can choose whether to get a numbered tile from the board or steal one from another player with the purpose of collecting victory points. And that's all the interaction there is to this game. I mentioned it's decent with kids because the mechanics are very simple, you count a lot, and as an adult you can choose not to steal tiles which skews the game somewhat in favor of the child. So with children I would rate it 7 but with adults I'd go with a 2.

A minor Knizia. Dice rolling, press-your-luck with mathematically calculable elements. Mechanically solid (as you'd expect from Knizia) but just not that interesting. If you want a simple dice game, "Can't Stop" and "Liar's Dice" are much more exciting.

{3 plays, many players}  I enjoyed this maybe more than I should've.  Simple press-your-luck dice rolling affair from Knizia that, played with gamers, perhaps takes too long.  Didn't bother me, though, for now.  And the dominoes are nice.

[initial rating: 7 ... many plays later] Wow.  I actually dislike this game now.  Enough to knock it down 3 full points!  For one thing, it just goes on tooooo looooong, especially for what's supposed to be a light dice game.  For another, I've played enough games now to see that when one player just gets lucky - and this tends to happen more often than not - the game is just no fun for everyone else.  There's just not enough you can actually do to counter that, other than try to target that player's top tile... often to the detriment of your own game.  The penalty for zonking needs to be there for the tension, but it's harshest on the trailing players, makes your bad luck feel even worse, and causes most games to end not "up," with someone, say, building to something or pressing their luck for an amazing comback, but rather in "decline," with players losing their earlier gains.  A somewhat negative finish.  Feh.

As a filler game, it's not terrible.  It has the problem of other dice push your luck games, where it can be difficult to get even the minimum number that you need.  I've only played with 5, and that seemed like too many - too much down time for what seems like it should be a quicker game.  Fairly simple to learn, though filled with your standard Knizia trademarks (convoluted scoring, mathiness, complete disconnect with the supposed theme).

Great 2 player game. With more players it becomes less strategic, and you don't have as much control protecting your tiles. A push your luck with some real decisions.  Good for playing with kids, they can grasp the idea very quickly.  The tiles are very nice and don't wear out.

A [i]very[/i] light game.  Light enough that I'm considering moving all of my previously-weighed "light" games up to "light medium."  For the most part a "push your luck" game, trying to get the higher numbers, or later in the game trying to roll an exact number so you can steal a tile from an opponent.

There is some strategy involved.  Take a lower number after grabbing a high one, to protect the latter.  The game really becomes evil if all of the low numbers are exhausted early, and people fail to earn the higher tiles in the later rounds.  Tactically speaking, it does require some simple addition, as you try to figure out the best way to roll a particular number.  Obviously, luck plays an extremely large factor.

A fun, end of the evening game.  I'll gladly play if someone suggests (and brings) it, but I'm not sure that it is compelling enough for me to purchase.

I've changed my mind about this game.  Oh, it can still be brutal, and it almost always fosters a runaway leader.  Those issues aside, it has been a great title for non-gamers.  I created a home-made copy while staying at a cousin's house, and suddenly we were playing it every night.  I've taken it on campouts with scouts, and it received a ton of interest.  This is a must-have for any collection, even if the game play isn't perfect.

Roll a fist full of dice
Apply glaringly obvious logic rules to dice selection
Apply basic probability to decide whether to roll again
Repeat.

Perhaps for children to learn basic addition and some probability this is a worthwhile exercise. To believe for a second that this is a meaningful or fun adult game is pure farse. An utter luck fest. Having said that this game is not broken, it's just absolute shite.

Probably one of the best Yahtzee style dice games. I do think the game kind of drags on too much though. Can probably be remedied by ignoring the rule that "if you have a failed roll and the returned tile is the highest, you don't flip that tile."

I find it interesting how the luck kind of balances out over the course of the game. Many of the players who get lucky during the early game end up losing many tiles as their luck "runs out".

PushYourLuck, MultiOnly

A simple die-rolling gambling game with a similar feeling to that of Can't Stop.  Being able to snatch won tiles from your opponents is annoying, but you have to match the number on their visible tile exactly---and since all your won tiles are in one stack, snatching is harder but nice when you can do it.

A fun little twist on the old Yahtzee-style dice-rolling game.  I like the mix of luck with the dice and a slight feeling of strategy as you choose the optimal dice to save.  The push-your-luck feel is just enough to keep my family coming back for more.  The components are great and the art is cute, so it is an attractive filler game for all the family.  And it really helps keep your mental math skills sharp.  With 4 or less players I think this one is a gem.  With more players the downtime between turns might get unbearable.

The downside to the game is the fact that there are turns where luck will just absolutely hose one player.  If you are never able to roll a worm, you lose.  If you are annoyed by games that are heavily influenced by luck then you should run screaming from this dice game.  There are strategic decisions, but even the best strategy can't counteract bad luck.  Still, we've found that every game is slightly different, and a player who failed miserably the first game could never fail in a second game.

The two strikes every dice game has against them from the start are downtime and luck.  So for a dice game to be good, it has to try and minimize both of these, yet keep the game fun.  Let me say this; Pickomino is a fun game.  The downtime isn't so bad because turns are short, but this also means the luck factor can creep it's ugly head in.  That being said, the strategic choices and probability at play here are rather nice.  I have seen people blow the game by making the incorrect strategic moves given their current score and dice totals, and for a dice game that is pretty cool.  I enjoy the way the probability unfolds in this game, and I have to say I find it more enjoyable than my previous favourite dice game, "Can't Stop".  As always, the fewer the players, the less downtime will be a factor.

(KIDS) This game is simple and pretty good, but requires everyone to just throw dice and move on.  Otherwise, the game can drag on too long.

A great game to have in the collection since it should appeal to just about anyone, grandmothers included, and plays up to 8 people. The tiles are of a great bakelite-like plastic and look almost indestructible. Great game to bring with you on a picknic, to the beach or whatnot.

As fast to learn as it’s to play, the light-hearted Pickomino is one of the best starters/finishers for your gaming sessions: even casual and non gamers will likely love it. To tell the truth, I’ve yet to find someone who utterly dislikes this fun filler. [i](November 2011)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - A long time favorite of mine and the groups i play with, Pickomino is ever since one of the go-to games when we feel like playing fillers or look for games that inexperienced new guys can join and enjoy quickly.

Since it never lets us down, during my Fall 2015 rating revise I raised my rating from 7 to a more solid 8.

The game is about a 6.5, but these factors kick it up one-half of a point: Great to play with a group that has at least one 'card bender' in it - gotta love the indestructible components! It's also a great addition to the "games that can be played outdoor" collection.

Apr 2011:  After hearing about everyone playing this on Facebook, I was interested to give it a try.  It's certainly a fun little diversion.  I can see how it could drag on with more players though as you sit there waiting for a turn.   2 player seemed fine, 3 might be ok, 4 would probably be a bore.

Not a ton of strategy here, and it's all about the rolls, but there are a few situations where you make push-your-luck decisions.  Initial rating a 6, but it may rise.   I prefer Sushizock to this one right now.

Dice games are supposed to be fun, with lots of laughing and shouting and collective expressions of joy and commiseration when someone rolls exceptionally well or poorly. Pickomino takes all the elements of that fun dice game I just described, removes all the joy and the laughter and the fun, and becomes instead a dry activity of throwing numbered cubes in order to collect domino tiles. Risk is not rewarded. Temperance and moderation wins the day. No thank you.

Press your luck dice game marred by excessive game length as everyone steals tiles from everyone else.  Fun for the first 15 minutes, unfortunately the game goes on for another 30.

Yuck. My first game of this was enjoyable, but the already-apparent flaws became all the more glaring the second time around.

A silly dice game which is probably more fun to play than Yathzee. On the other hand Yathzee at some point ends; this game can end in an endless tug of war which overstays the simplicity of the title by far. I'd be in favour of a variant where the game ends with just one time remaining. Saves on a lot of irritating dice rolls which have more to do with luck than with whatever little planning is involved in the beginning. I don't feel the need to play this again soon; I'd rather do Roll Through The Ages instead.

[b]Update[/b] There is no skill in rolling what you need at the right time; downgraded to its current rate where it will stay indefinitely. I am not going to play this again, ever.

My rating applies only to the two player game.  With two, the game is a lot of fun, although maybe a bit repetative.  But with  many more than 2, it just drags too much.  Part of the problem is that, with more than 2, there is a much better chance of tiles being stolen, and that really slows down the game.

Any game with this much dice-rolling might seem to be random, but there are some solid choices to be made here.  I think this might be "push your luck" at its simplest and I actually enjoy it, which for me is saying a lot.  The attack your neighbor element is not overly powerful, so it's hard for anyone's feelings to be hurt for long.

Great fun, but I slightly favor Sushizock im Gockelwock over this one.

RATING: 3
Production: Simple, wooden dice; simple, sturdy dominoe-like tiles.  Play: At moments an entertaining press-your-luck game, but each roll has fewer dice and more restrictions, and there are fewer tiles to capture as the game progresses, so there is less and less incentive to keep going when one can already capture a tile.  Also, the minimum sum necessary to capture a tile continues to rise, thus making the first few rolls somewhat arbitrary, as players attempt to meet the minimum.  This game lacks the fun how-shall-I-combine-the-dice element of Yahtzee and Knights.  (2+0+1) (2 plays)

I like light dice games (Exxtra, Um Krone und Kragen, Knights), but I didn't think this on was much fun.  Too many people scoring nothing at all, combined with the problem of losing things you have won (in more than one way), without a way to creatively trash talk made for a frustrating game.

Una mica decepcionant. Knizia va fer un refregit d'aquest, el Sushi Bar que té la Sònia, que m'agrada més que aquest perquè: és més ràpid, i pots "robar" a qui vulguis.
En aquest les partides s'allarguen molt més, i al ser un push-your-luck pot cansar si la partida s'allarga. A més, els daus marquen a qui has de robar. Encara que tu intentis treure un número per robar a algú, els daus decidiran. No hi ha control.

I tried to give it a chance and played it with different groups for maybe six times, but I never got over the strong feeling that it would probably be more fun to stick a fork in my stomach than to play this game.

This is a nice little "push your luck" dice game which can be played in 10 to 15 minutes. It is nothing I would want to play very often, but it is fun if played sporadically and with the right group of people. You can screw other players by stealing their tiles, but in order to do so, you have to roll the right values with your dice. You can also try to make some tactical decision to save your precious tiles and there is some risk management in the selection of the dice to set apart. So it's not a mindless dice throwing exercise but it's also no rocket science. It's just a neat filler. If you are not sure if you would like it, you should try the free PnP game [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/6955/reiner-knizias-decathlon]Decathlon[/url] by the same author. If you like that, you'll probably also enjoy Pickomino.

Another "push your luck" dice game from Knizia.  Players roll 8 dice (numbered 1-5, plus a worm symbol) and freeze one previously unfrozen roll result.  The idea is to match the total of a "worm tile" on offer on the BBQ, in order to claim it.  If you match exactly another player's top worm tile, you may take that instead.  Crapping out means a tile is returned to the BBQ and the worms on offer reduces by 1.  Just the right amount of thought required ("hmm, to take the 28 off Roger, I will save the two 4's now....").  Lots of fun, with lovely chunky tiles.

The probability calculations when locking dice are very interesting and wonderfully tense. But the endgame is not guaranteed to be tense: if someone has a stack of tiles and someone else has hardly any, you can know who will win before it happens, especially if tiles of larger values that could help have burned away. More aggressive stealing throughout the game seems to be necessary to prevent that kind of ending.

Having now tried this a few times with the Extrawurm expansion, I find that it's a lot more fun and would raise it by a point to a [BGCOLOR=#00FFFF][b]7[/b][/BGCOLOR] (with the expansion). Initially I thought it would extend the game even more but that has not proven to be the case so far. Games are fast and furious and a whole lot more interesting. 

-------------Original rating 18/10/15 Score:6
[b]Rating based on - 25+ plays, 2 player[/b]
I got this as a present from my other half because I was talking about it so much. A lot of people here on the Geek recommend it for camping, travel, pubs etc. I don't get it. Maybe the drinking element influenced the rating?  It was OK, and there are definitely fun moments, but certainly nothing to write home about. Sometimes it can also go on a little too long and overstay its welcome - i.e. you think its a quick filler but then you've been playing 45 mins and it's still not over! The best thing about the game is those solid lovely cool tiles. The white dice are poor. They get really filthy after a while even though we always wash our hands before playing games. I see there is an expansion out this year. Might be willing to give that a try and see if it will inject more fun into this game but only if I happen to spot it cheap and I need to pad out an order. I'd rather play Alles Käse or Geistesblitz/Geistesblitz 2.0

I really enjoy this game, and the kids like it too.  At least they like it for one play.  After that it gets a little old.  The problem is that, like Yahtzee, you are really just taking turns playing a solitaire game.  This game has some player interaction, but not a lot.  And there is nothing to do but watch as the other players roll their dice.  Still, I do enjoy the game.

I played Heckmeck with 6 players the first time I played it and I felt it suck then primarily because I could take a short nap between my turn and the other players' turn. However, when I played it with just me and one other person the game played better. There is less lull time between turns and the game went very fast--as filler games should. Finally, there was less stealing, which is good for gamers who get possessive of their worms.

 For around 10 bucks you could not go wrong.

Also, a nice small present to "non-gamers"...

RATING: 7
Surprisingly engaging. It's not easy to know which die (dice) to set aside. I love how the status changes from one minute to another. You feel that you are falling behind, and all of sudden you are back in the lead, either because you have stolen from other players or because other players have failed.

This is a game for children and adults to play together.  A lot of dice rolling.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It maybe plays a little long with higher player counts, but it's such a charming little game. The Doris-Matthäus-drawn worms on their chunky tiles help, but otherwise it's just a great, thematic (ever hear the term "pecking order") little Knizia game. Also a great 'educational' game for sums and probability. This despite having some of the worst-written rules ever. Also has a cute, if slightly clunky, app version I've played dozens of times.

Update: The expansion added some fun back into this for my eldest, though even then he rarely seems to request it. My youngest isn't ready to play it, so I'll wait, but otherwise I think it would be heading out the door. I still like it, but if it never gets to the table...

Eight word review:
Slightly boring light dice game. Rather play Tokyo.

Played 5 times. Rating history: 6|5|5|5|6

Decent dice game, but so many other out there, that nothing about this one makes it stand out as a purchase. Yahtzee rates about the same for me and it's free.

RATING: 7
A really fast game with 2.  With 3 the playing time doubled.  I want to try it with 7 players would definitely be a party game, but wonder how long a game would last.  Since one of my children only likes dice games this at least gives another game option, and there is some strategy along with the luck.  A cute theme.  In fact there is more strategy than I originally thought that changes throughout the game.

[Dice rolling, Set collection] Stripped-down Reiner dice game. Players collect sets of dice rolls to claim numbered tiles from a common pool or from other players. The rhythm of the game has a player rolling several times on his turn, instead of the more familiar "roll once or twice and pass the dice" system that provides a better cadence (cf. Clash of the Gladiators, Bluff). It's this lack of a good, steady rhythm of dice rolling around the table that tanks Heckmeck as a light filler game. It might have a bit of value as a 2P game, but considering the options out there, why bother?

Para pasar el rato entre dos partidas de un juego de verdad.
No obstante, por ser muy sencillo, con dados y gusanitos y fichas de domino y tal, puede ser un buen introductorio para para niños en el vicio. De hecho, en nuestro club se utiliza para eso, aunque de vez en cuando no quita para que los "mayores" juguemos una partida de desfogue.

No jogo nos somos galinhas lutando para comer o maior número possível de minhas. Estranho mas é o tema do jogo. A mecânica é de rolagem de dados para tentar obter o maior número possível e assim poder pegar uma das peças na mesa. Quando maior o valor que você conseguir mais chance de pegar uma peça com mais minhocas. O ponto alto do jogo fica na hora de decidir pegar uma peça da mesa, de outro jogador ou rolar os dados novamente para tentar pegar uma peças mais valiosa mas correndo o risco de perder as que adquiriu anteriormente. Legalzinho.

easy to learn and teach, dice rolling push your luck game (similar to 10,000 if you ever played that, but this is better). Beer and chips anyone? Gets a bit boring for the other players who wait for their turn. It seems that 4 or less is a good number of players. Also experienced players rarely loose their lead dispite the rest of the table trying to bash the leader. Can take 40 minutes which is a bit too long for what it is.

Pickomino is a cute game and a solid dice game for kids. Dice games are always going to have a healthy dose of luck, but Pickomino might have just a little too much for my liking. Can't Stop is similar to this one and a lot more appealing to adults and children alike. For adults, Pickomino is a little too fluffy. But yeah- nice game for the kids though and easier for them then Can't Stop.

Good for what it is: a simple dice game.  All about probability and pushing your luck.  The components are really cool... about a dozen domino-sized plastic pieces with numbers and "worms" on them and 8 special 6-sided dice.  A great "take anywhere, play with anybody game".  I suspect it would be more interesting if you were playing for .25 cents per point!

I like this game for some reason and so does everyone who plays it that is not uber euro-gamer.  Die rolls are random so the outcome is pretty much all luck.  Strategy points: if you can steal worms, do it.  If you can get some worms from the the barbie take them.  Conservative play generally wins the day if the dice are rolling.  Dice tower useful for kids.

This beautifully designed game is only getting an 7/10 for grade 1&2 children learning addition because the score often gets wildly imbalanced.  This tends upset children on the losing side... and it often becomes obvious that they are going to lose long before the end of the game.

For a better game for the grade 1&2 demographic, look at Rat-a-tat Cat.  If you love Liars Dice (Perudo) & Lost Cities, you'll love Rat-a-Tat Cat.

[Original comment] A great family game. We play it often, with 7-8 players. It is simply a push-your-luck dice game, with a twist. Easy for all ages to play together.

May 2009 -- We play this now and then, especially since our granddaughter enjoys it (one of the few games she plays with us). It's enough fun to keep us interested, and certainly not a brain challenge.

October 2011 -- For a very simple game, this one is fun, especially when we don't want to play a challenging brain-burner. It's an excellent way to introduce new game players to our game days.

2013-November:  We still enjoy playing this occasionally.

Five plays. Players try to put together high totals so as to take dominoes from the display or from the other players, but the rules governing exactly how you go about doing this can actually create some tricky dilemmas. 

I used to rate this a bit higher, but the game is not necessarily a quick in-and-out filler; if players are rolling poorly then things can really drag out as they try to snag the last couple of tiles. I recommend the variant in which tiles returned to the display are turned over if they are the highest.

I prefer [thing=37400][/thing].

This is a really fun and original dice game, which gets a lot of play in my lunchtime group, where we are always looking to steal worms off other players... 3 is the absolute best number of players for this, and a game with 3 play in 20 minutes or less... 4 is ok, but more than that it just becomes far too slow.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Although very high on the luck scale, the game is amusing. There are a few decisions to be made, predominately centering on which dice to save on each roll, and whether you should continue to roll or be satisfied with the total you’ve already accumulated. While causing some occasional angst, these decisions aren’t terribly taxing, and the consequences generally are not dire. The main decision: push your luck or not. 

So, the final assessment is that Pickomino is a game that is an amusing filler and one that should be a pleasant diversion. It should also prove popular with folks outside a regular gaming group, as the rules are easy to learn, the game plays relatively quickly (so long as you don’t play with 7 players!), and the result is rather satisfying. Pickomino isn’t going to be a classic that will be around 30 years from now, but it will be enjoyed no matter how long its life span may be.

Finom, meleg a grillgilisztám
A könnyen tanítható, egyszerű szabályokkal bíró, de mégis szórakoztató társasok között böngészve már korábban is szemet szúrt ez a játék, amelyet később használtan meg is vásároltam. Úgy érzem megérte a pénzkiadást és nem pénzkidobás lett belőle.
A játékban kakasként/tyúkként az éves nyári baromfipartin próbáljuk lecsempészni tányérkánkra a grillről a gilisztákat.
A tipikus „meddig van bátorságod elmenni” alapon körödben a nyolc darab 6-oldalú kockát (1-5 és egy gilinyó oldal) eldobod és újradobsz, amíg megszerzel valami finomságot vagy éppen dobásodat elbukva vársz a következő lehetőségre.
Ha időben megállsz a dobás értékének megfelelő gyűrűsférget magad helyezed le (ha többet is megszereztél, akkor az előtted lévő legfelsőre rakod le). A többi játékosnak később lehetősége van, hogy pontos dobással megszerezze a legfelsőt a te „tányérodról”. Bukás esetében (a kidobott kockák csak olyan számot mutatnak, amilyen kockákat már korábban félretettél vagy nem sikerül gilinyót dobnod) a legértékesebb giliszta megszökik, kidobásra kerül a játékból, tovább csökkentve a lehetőségeidet.
A szabályok könnyen elsajátíthatóak, kis taktika is vihető a játékba, bár a kockadobás és merészséged fog dönteni. Kellemes kikapcsolódás, bár több fővel azért a játékidő sem rövid. Tökéletes partijáték, ha leöntöd sörrel, sincs gond.

RATING: 7
This is a fun little press your luck game, and I have a soft spot in my heart for those. The components are very nice, probably boosting the price a little higher than is worth it for a game so light. If you are interested in theme at all, you won't find it here either. Nevertheless, it can be played with 2-7, is easy to teach, and is pretty fun. Would be at home in most any game collection as a filler, but most people won't suggest you build a game night around it.

A light dice game where one attempts to roll the highest total.  Players may re roll as often as they want, and must select a dice # which they have not selected previously.  Further, at least one worm is needed in order to obtain a tile.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A pretty darn good dice game that allows for some player interaction when you steal your opponents' tiles. Clever. Moves quickly and has a good timing mechanism to keep the game from lasting too long. This is probably a third place in the category for me, behind Ra Dice and Can't Stop. 

A great time-waster as a solitaire game on Facebook, too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
This one is a pretty fun press your luck game. Where it falters for me is the end game, which can be especially cruel for the players having bad luck with the dice rolls, and it really is very luck driven. Still I don't mind so much since it usually plays rather quickly. And the tiles are just fantastic.

RATING: 7
Another yahtzee variant. But a rather nice one.
There is no real theme here, but the mechanics are very sound. Especially the possibility of stealing the topmost tile from an opponent if you reach the exact tile number.

It plays quickly. Wouldn't recommend 5 players for any kind of yahtzee game because of increased downtime though. 

Also due to the stealing mechanic the game taunts you to push your luck constantly wich leads to funny or exciting rolls.

Good one.

First played this on Feb 15th, 2007.  This is a good quick push your luck dice game.  If you're looking for something that doesn't require a lot of thought to play and be a game to "relax" at, this is it.  There is a tiny bit of strategy with decisions to go or stay, however most of it is luck of the dice roll.  Worth a play every now and then to mix things up.

Pickomino is a press-your-luck, take-that dice game.  Every once and a while you can choose what course of action to take (what tile to steal from an opponent, whether to go high or fall back low), but more often than not your dice will make that choice for you.  Not rollong a single worm all round can be excrutiating.  Don't be surprised when halfway thru the game you have no tiles due to steals or multiple bonk-outs.  This is a game of 99% luck; don't let anyone tell you otherwise...

At first it seems surprisingly playable (though extremely simple), but after a few games it becomes awfully boring.

Don't play it with 6 people or more.  Lots of downtime and the game is too looong (more opportunities to steal others' tiles).  It might be annoying also with 5.  2-4 players is the optimal number.

Great little dice game that is very easy to learn and teach.  Very good for teaching quick addition and number grouping skills.

I initially made a junk version out of scraps from my [GameID=28452] build:

Build information can be found [b][url=http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/46525/item/1116925#item1116925]here[/url][/b].

The kids really like this as you get to roll a lot of dice. I think having the 5/diamond die face instead of just a diamond helps a bit with the adding.  Was very happy to see my oldest, in our first game, decide to take a two and stop rolling instead of a group of threes as she was then able to steal my top card.

Pickomino is a good family game, but I never liked it very much. I found the game to be repetitive, boring and with lots of uncontrollable luck. The decisions are obvious. It can be fun with the right crowd, but my desire to play it is very low. 

The rules are dead easy and can be explained under 3 minutes. Its playtime is way too much for what it offers.

(I don't own this and don't know if there's a 2P variant.)

The chickens that are [i]on[/i] the box are not [i]in[/i] the box. The BBQ worms are cute but really completely irrelevant. The "...omino" pieces aren't playable tiles they're just the trophy counters. This is a simple "push your luck" set-collecting dice game where the theme really feels pointless to me. (Whereas often unconnected themes in games still feel pleasant to me.) Adding the trophy element to an old standard dice game is a twist, but not enough to grab my attention.

After 1 play: Naaaah.

However the group seems to love the dice games, and with a little dash of push-your-luck involved, it usually means we can squeak out a few games before we move on to something bigger for game night; and have a great deal of fun doing so.

Push your luck dice game with a confrontational element. There is some potential for dumb play. But with a bit thinking this game comes down to the luckiest roll respectively the luck that others can't steal your worms. There are better dice games around. I like Hoppladi-Hopplada from the same publisher better.

RATING: 8
(July 2008) The big problem with this is the downtime between turns.  There's nothing really to do while other people are going except watch what tiles you could potentially steal (which doesn't take much effort) or cheer on your opponents.  Still, it's light and hits the spot when you want to roll a bunch of dice.

Traded away.

UPDATE - November 2011.  I'm sure I was playing by the incorrect rules before, and also playing with too many players.  With 3 the game is a blast, though I would be very hesitant to play with more.  Up from 5 to 8.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
My rating has nothing to do with the fact that I didn't win the game (shaddup!). Rather, I found the Yahtzee mechanism too repetitive (up to six rerolls) and the game too long.

[Update] With 3 players, this game is better (less downtime), but not by much.

Love this quirky dice game.  Components are nice, just solid dominoes and wooden dice.  The game can drag on if you play with standard rules, I'd use the express rules where you burn the top worm on ANY turn where a worm isn't earned either from the grill or stealing.

RATING: 4
Better than Yahtzee. Less pushing your luck than simply rolling and seeing what you can get. Target numbers become more specific as tiles are distributed, but the decisions don't become a lot more interesting, and this is also where the game begins to drag with several players as the game clock is completely unmoved by tile stealing.

2014-02-13 - All right family dice roller. Don't play with too many people - faster the better.

2016-05-23 - 7->6 - I reconsidered my rating. The game is OK but I'm not as eager to play it again as other titles I rated with 7. And I just prefer games that are not as light as this one.

Light dice game, a.k.a. Heckmeck am Bratwurmeck or Regenwormen. Pretty straigthforward: roll dice and decide which to put aside.

Far too much luck involved in rolling the die. There's a little bit of probability crunching in deciding what to keep, and that keeps it from being entirely random. For instance, you could realize that if you roll all singles, you shouldn't take the top roll, contrary to what you might expect. But there's still so little strategy to this and so, so much luck. Played with 5.

RATING: 2
The goal is not to get the highest amount of worms, it's to be the only player to get worms. In a 7 player game, I think only 2-3 players ended up with 1 tile. The concept is interesting but the game is so hard because it's so easy to lose the tiles you have.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Heckmeck is a fun push-your-luck dicefest.  Whenever I got a little tired over the great classic Can't Stop, this really hits the sweet spot in the "filler dice games" genre.  I much prefer this over Lucky Loop and Exxtra.  With a large group, I'll go with Diamant.  And you just gotta get the "Heckmeck" version b/c it sounds better to say than 'Pickomino'... ;D   (If you think this is too long, you can play with the variant where the top domino is discarded every time someone "craps out".)

RATING: 5
Fun, random dice rolling filler.  If you like rolling dice in a quick 15 minute game, this is it...:-)  The basic concept is that you are rolling 8 dice, separating them according to the numbers rolled, and deciding to keep only one set of numbers.  You keep rolling until you can either take a tile from the "barbecue grill" because the sum of the dice is equal to or greater than that tile  (numbers range sequentially from 21 - 35 or so), steal a specific tile from another player by rolling that specific number, or bust by failing to roll a required number which then requires you to return one of your own tiles face down to the grill!  Each tile has a different amount of worms on the tile which is tallied at the end to determine the victor.  The D6 has the numbers 1 through 5 and also one face with worms showing (each worm is worth 5 points).  You are not eligible to win a tile unless your dice collection includes at least one worm die.

Another push-your-luck dicing game. While it's not Can't Stop, it certainly is fun. Bizarrely, for such a short game it always seems too long. I always wish there were less tiles. The variant making it faster by turning over more tiles is our preferred way to play for the above reasons.

Fun, though, and we probably always want to play this at least twice, especially when I feel I've screwed it in the early go. Which is always the case. And then I screw it in the 3rd go, which annoys me to the point that I have reduce the rating here by 1.

YMMV.

Filler based on "push your luck" with dice. Repetitive. Boring. Lasts too much.

RATING: 7
This is an interesting game. It is heavily luck-based, relying on dice rolling and guts to collect the tiles.

We find the cadence of the game quite enjoyable, however. You can generally score a bunch of tiles early on in the game, and one person can get way ahead. Once the lower half of the tiles are gone, however, the game can quickly shift as the higher point tiles go unclaimed and your stack of tiles is steadily whittled away. You never really know who is winning until the end.

The dice rolling is also a blast. The requirement that you have at least one worm in your hand really spices things up.

The game is definitely more chaotic and lively with more players. There are way more opportunities to steal worm tiles. This is a very social game.

The whole family had to play this hundred of times in the first months after we got it. My son was thrilled about it and for now is no. 1 in his top and I might say we enjoy it too.
At first it might look bland but after playing a while it really catches you. The risk/luck balance is addictive and I might say that is very educative for kids, teaching them when to risk and how to face loses.
Overall a huge success for us.

RATING: 8
Light push your luck filler.  Definitely have grown to appreciate it the more I play it.  

Nice components for playing outside while hanging out.  That's the kind of atmosphere this game was made for.  

Love that you can steal other people's tiles.  Gives you a few more options to consider on your turn.  Stop now and take the lesser value worm?  Do I push my luck to go for the higher value worms on the grill?  Or do I try to hit an exact # to steal my opponent's tile?  What are the odds for both?  You can play this very light without considering the odds on each play (which would make this game feel a bit mindless).  Or you can dig in a little deeper and calculate the probabilities of your rolls.  You still won't be doing any heavy mental work, but at least you'll feel like your decisions are playing a small part in the outcome of the game.

2-7p, 20m.  Reiner Knizia's fix of Farkel or Cosmic Wimpout.  He simplified the rules and scoring, but maintained the press-your-luck feeling of those old classics.

Fun light dicegame.  Very engaging.  Has a few nice twists. It is a very balanced game, but it can go on a bit long if there is a lot of tile snatching. Only problem that I have found is that ultimatly there is no way to counteract bad ill-timed dice rolls. Too much luck involved. Oh yeah, don't believe the box. Never play this with more than 4 people! Otherwise it gets painfully dull between turns.

One of my favourite fillers at the moment. It provides some tough, push-your luck decisions about dice probabilities. The ability to steal tiles adds a small "take that" element, which generates a bit of trash talk but without it distracting too much from the pace and levity of the game. The best thing about Pickomino is that it plays fast and most newbies learn it quickly enough to understand and enjoy their first game.

RATING: 6.5
A very simple game which entertains at all levels: young, old, family or gamer. The only downside is with more than 4 players the downtime between turns makes it drag a bit whilst you wait for all the other players to take their turn.

An absolutely superb push-your-luck/stitch-up-your-fellow-gamers game.  Very simple rules, lots of dice rolling, but enough decision making to keep it interesting.  Okay, the final winner is a bit arbitrary but play this with the right people and you'll have a great laugh getting there!

RATING: 9
Pickomino is a 'Push-Your-Luck' game with an almost anti-Yahtzee set of mechanics.

Bakelite tiles (think Mahjonng) in the same shape as Rummikub tiles lend the game a classy look and feel.

This is better than Can't Stop and Diamant (Incan Gold) and should be in every family/gamer's collection.

A classic that has long evaded my table because of my fear of dice. However, Heckmeck has forced me to reevaluate dice games, the game utilizes dice as they should be used - ie. as a push your look medium. It's a good filler that is a short and a fairly sweet, brainless chicken out thing.

Light game of rolling dice, pushing your luck and possible player screwing.  There's no safe winner until the very end, as you may have a big pile of worms and see it stolen one by one by your fellow worm-eaters.

I'm not big on "press your luck". This game has some elements that make it bit more fun/interesting, but not enough to make me a huge fan.

完全就是個骰運加上賭博的遊戲
感覺普普
規則:
*將數字板塊由小至大依序排好，隨機起始
*從起始開始，每個人的回合都擲骰，每次要固定一個數字的所有骰不重擲，且該數字之前不能固定過，隨時可以停住不繼續擲，如果擲出數字都已固定過就要吐牌。
>拿牌 至少一蟲骰才能拿牌，點數總和，蟲算作5分，可拿場上同等於或低於你得分的一張牌，放到自己的得分堆最上面，如果其他玩家最上面那個分數跟你點數一樣也可拿
>吐牌 沒辦法拿牌或是沒辦法合法停止時，將得分堆最上面的那張牌繳回，並將場上數字最大的牌翻面，如果該玩家什麼牌都沒有就翻牌即可
*當中央區無數字板塊時結束，牌上蟲總和最高的玩家即為獲勝玩家。

Vastly underrated!

I heard the Doctor in an interview talk about beeing proud about pickomino's dice mechanism and that made me check it out. 

Fantastic in it's simplicity! I find Knizia's abstract way of making games outdated when it comes to more heavy games, but unmatched when it comes down to simpler games like Lost cities, Battle line, Alles Tomate (great, GREAT memory game destroyed by it's childish theme) and now Pickomino).

I really apreciate that a players turn can't drag on for ever. I also own "Can't Stop" that falls in the push your luck category, but I get easily bored during other players turn because I get the feeling they will never stop rolling. 

The stealling action is the mechanism that gives this game the depth it needs to avoid the children only barrier.

Just perfect!

... along with Hive, my only portable game with components that can't be destroyed by food and beverages!

Great filler/pub/drinking game.

Remember if you overshoot your roll, you can take lowest available from display-you don't have to exact it-but simply achieve/best it. I missed this first go around.(Pg 4, 2nd para.)

To steal from another player-roll must be exact.

I played with 7 ("Trek in the Park"), not the first I'd pick with 7, but if it what you got- it isn't horrible. And so easy to teach.

Having played this game and also Yahtzee lately I have to admit, that I like this game! There aren't many decisions in this game and it's only a dicefest. Still it has more direct confrontation than Yahtzee and therefore is better fun. I have definetly to raise my vote. I even decided to get this game on my own as this is ideal to be played with my nephews. Good job Reiner.
Update: I raised my vote again, because even it is an ultralight game, it is definitely much fun. B&P

Surprisingly fun considering you are only rolling dice.  Depends on the crowd.  I think it's best with 3 or 4.  2 seems pointless (but, in fairness I haven't tried) and 5 or more you have to wait too long for your turn.  Also, with a larger crowd it's less of you being lucky with your roles and more of the others being unlucky with theirs.  Which brings up the question, you do prefer doing well yourself, or see your opponents fail?

Played iOS app.

Press your luck game to keep rolling to get tile values, however each number can be selected once and one must have the worms in their total.  Interesting concept with the worms and which dice to select and when to grab a tile to protect previous tiles.

This game was too swingy for me with losing tiles due to misthrows or stealing.  It was very frustrating.

After a comment about Dairyman being similar to Pickomino, my interest in this old design was triggered, especially noticing it forces multiplication and adding die rolls to determine your target score to claim a 'omino' .  I was hoping this tense die roller would be engaging practice in certain math skills my boys are doing at school.

Sadly we haven't finished one game as per written rules: my 8yo finds it boring and my 6yo hates losing an 'omino' when failing a die roll or having one taken off him. I guess that is why the box is marked for 8 plus as emotional maturity may be common at the age.

So at the moment I love the inherent qualities of the design (to test sorting out the tiles in increasing numbers, multiplying, adding and discriminating pip values), but I can't see it getting played at the moment.......unless I get the expansion to make it more toy like and to allow friend benefits to ease the pain.

RATING: 3
The game is over-priced ($25) and over-produced for what it is. Cosmic Wimpout is a much better choice for this type of game. Oh hell, just grab a pair of dice and play craps. (It requires more thought.)

It has been many years since I had last played this game, and when I played it last, I was actually falling asleep during the game. With this second try, I didn't nod off, but the game was annoying enough we quit after the first two rounds. The idea here is you roll some dice, and then take tiles either from the center or from each other. The game seems to go on forever as player after player pillages each other's tiles rather than making the game progress by taking something from the center. Terrible game.

Plays a lot like Can't Stop although the probabilities are much easier to calculate on the fly. This lets the game be played on two completely different levels, the rapid silly social game and a deeper math game of taking tiles, protecting tiles, and stealing tiles. Rated as a 6 for either style of play, especially when more than 2 are involved. Plays seems to need a transition from early boldness to later conservative play. A fun dice game that I'd really want to play with only 3 or 4 players.

A gift from Reiner Knizia himself! Cheltenham Science Festival 2012.

Players take it in turns to roll dice. A player must keep all of one number and re-roll the rest on each roll. They can choose to trade the dice in for a set of worms when-ever the total of the dice is high enough - or they can press their luck and risk going bust.
The principles are simple but like the best Knizia games there is some thought to what you should do. Fun, easy to learn, quick, but sufficiently interesting not to bore regular players.

Over produced filler with a downside that need to be fixed - plays too long for what it is (suggest that the variant rule - returned tiles are also flipped over to speed game play).  Also, need near perfect rolls to even have a chance at the higher tiles.  As a result, rare is the meaningful decision - so game has too little "press your" and too much "luck" for a true "press-your-luck" variant.  Game's merits are size (very portable), easy to play with kids (especially if variant is used to minimize time), looks interesting on the table, so will be kept around as a filler for occasional play.

Neat little dice game from a really good company. I like the small box and the nice solid bits. As dice games go it's okay - I enjoy the extra angst that goes with the stealing element. It's a game to bring out with the young kids, and this is where it shines. With kids the game is educational (arithmetic and calculating odds), and the enjoyment the kids get rubs off on the adults - much more than if playing with just adults. Seems about right with three or four players - more than this and you'll be waiting a while between turns. One problem is that fairly often a game just becomes a runaway affair and as such can be rather boring. This can be mitigated somewhat by taking outrageous risks and watching the glee/disbelief on the kids faces when they do or don't payoff. I don't think much of the English name. I rate it about a "4" with adults - as I said - great with kids.

Great dice filler - certainly luck driven but there is some choices available to the player with mild tactical play available.

Very fun game suitable for kids but not to detract from a fun experience for big 'uns too, with push-your-luck AND screw your opponent.  It's kinda To Court the King without the gamery element, or a little like Can't Stop with a take-that option.

This is a great end-of night option which just ain't about the winning, but is a great loud-sledging-banter-dice-rollin fest.

At 20 minutes, playing up to 7 and with the ability of having young players I reckon it deserves a slot in any collection.

While [i]Pickomino[/i] brings [i]Sushizock im Gockelwok[/i] to mind, the two are distinctly different from one another.  Yes, they both have custom dice and custom dominoes.  And they both involve rolling the dice to determine which dominoes are gained and lost.  They're even similar in duration.  

In some cases, this might mean that it would be redundant to own both, but that's not the case here.  If you enjoy one enough to purchase it, then it's quite likely that the other would be a good purchase as well.

I've found that over time I sometimes prefer [i]Pickomino[/i], and sometimes [i]Sushizock[/i].  Very glad to own both.

RATING: 4
We played this late in the night as a session closer and boy I didn't expect that much chicken impersonations. Definitely a game to bring to a bar. The basic dice rolling has a twist (you must set aside a whole set of same numbered dice) which makes an interesting risk taking proposition, but the most original feature is the weird dramaturgy of the game. The game starts with people building up their pile of worms until suddenly the market is saturated and the whole thing crashes and then in all the debris somebody floats to the surface and wins. Interesting definitely (I tried some strategy in structure of worm pile building and it paid out - protect a high value tile with one or two low value ones before trying for another high one).

Kniza does his usual twist on a push your luck dice game. This time, players lay out great looking bakelite tiles with numbers from 21-36 as well as worm symbols on them. Each turn, a player rolls 8 dice and sets aside one set of die value. This is repeated until the player goes bust or stops. Players who stop can choose to take a worm from the BBQ or off someone else.

When all the tiles have been flipped over (by people going bust) or taken, the game ends and the player with the most worm symbol wins! Fun, light and silly but offers players interesting decisions.

I really didn't expect to like this as much as I do after the first couple of plays.  It was purchased mainly as a potential game for the assisted living folks but it will be getting some table time at home also.  My husband wanted to play again immediately after our first play and that's always a good sign!  This is a great little push your luck game.

Better than Yahtzee. When I'm in the mood for a super light dice fest, this is the go-to game! Simple rules, fast play - it's a great filler game, or if you don't play "some" games as fillers between "other" games (like me), then it's just great if you're in the mood for a light-hearted dice fest.

A szabálymagyarázat és a játék is rendkívül gyorsan lemegy. Könnyed, egyszerű, mégis némi döntést igényel a kockadobáson kívül. Jól működik ketten is és akár heten is játszható. Aranyos a története is. Bármikor elővehető, jó átvezető, levezető játék.
8 kockával dobunk és kukacokat szerzünk a grillsütőről. Figyelni kell, hogyan csoportosítjuk a kockáink, mert ha rosszul döntünk és szerencsétlenek is vagyunk, mennek vissza megszerzett kukacaink a grillre.

Random, push your luck dice game.  Even as a filler it fails, as the games can go on far longer than expected. It seems that overall the decisions are obvious.  Roll well and win, roll poorly and lose.  The downtime is obnoxious, but it is perfect for sitting on the toilet while waiting your turn.

I'd like to play this again and with a more than just two players to make a more fair assessment, but this seemed more like a press-your-luck where if you press it too much, you can really stand to lose a lot of ground. I'm not sure that it's as good as other press-your-luck games out there.

RATING: 6
Much preferable to Yahtzee (includes press-your-luck and stealing elements as well as competition for tiles), but I'd never play it with more than three players and sometimes even a two-player game overstays its welcome.  

Very nice bits, highly portable, kids like it, and it's good addition practice for them.

[Zoch 'Heckmeck am Bratwurmeck' 2005 edition] {Animal, kid; dice-collection; optimal 4p} Pickomino is a nice dicefest filler. It's quite fun and provides some decisions. It also has nice player interaction, in which players can attempt to steal the 'worms' from other players. It's dynamic enough that it's not easy to predict the winner until very late game. Though it's fun, it's too long for 5 or more players.

The tiles are very sturdy but the graphic is dull. The dice are not durable and easily get dirty after a few games.

[Comparison] 'Easy come, Easy Go' is a better and more streamlined dice game from Knizia. It's much faster and more interactive and with simpler decisions. Nevertheless, both games are very suitable for children.

I giocatori sono delle accanite galline ruspanti che cercano di accaparrarsi quanti più vermi possibile fra quelli rappresentati sulle tessere: i vermi sono infatti il loro piatto preferito! La lotta è senza esclusione di colpi e si svolge con molteplici lanci di dadi: a ogni turno si cerca di conquistare una delle tessere raggiungendone il valore. Vince chi colleziona il maggior numero di vermi tra le tessere vinte.

Elenco elementi di gioco:
16 Tessere con valori da 21 a 36
8 Dadi numerati da 1 a 5 più il simbolo del verme che vale 5
1 Libretto delle regole.

[gameid=15818] is a game of pushing your luck, rolling dice and hoping to get the best food. Chickens compete over fried worms to have with their dinner.

It is easy to learn, easy to play and fun to experience, but it is a dice game. Played with kids it can be fun, but also a hard experience, if someone steal your fried worms under your nose.

A decent game with the right crowd.

The design of Pickomino is so simple, and so charming, that it's the THEME that disappoints.  There almost isn't any.  Players roll dice Yahtzee-style to hit the best domino they can.  It begs for an immersive board, a backstory, maybe some coins, or cubes, or SOMETHING to keep players engaged while they wait for their turn.  As it stands, Pickomino is a boxed mechanism.  It's a decent filler for three, but no more.

In all honesty,  had it not been for the quality production,  this entry would likely find itself mired in mediocrity. It is not often that chrome can carry a meager design on it's back - but that is just what these components do.

The game has merit,  but in reality,  it's success lies more in it's wise cosmetic enhancements,  than it does in the game design itself.

People call it a 'push your luck' game, but you don't get a lot of opportunities to actually push your luck. You HAVE to reach a certain minimum to score at all. You HAVE to roll a worm somewhere or your six 5's are worthless. And you CAN'T take a number more than once. More often than not, you are simply trying to play to all of these requirements. Much less often than are, you have the requirements met and few enough restrictions that you actually can push your luck. The Bottom Line: O.k. Even fun at times, but not much substance.

Fun little press-your-luck type of dice game.  You roll until you can take worms off the grill or steal them from the other players.  Plays fast and easy.

RATING: 4
Really nice components, but I'm not really interested in playing this push-your-luck game again any time soon.  Maybe it feels too much like Yahtzee, or something.

Traded.

Update: Played a few more times recently.  Seems like the kind of game you could enjoy while having a meal or a conversation.  Only the active player needs to focus on the game, while the rest can be doing something else.  Maybe it's a side game for a longer tactical game?

RATING: 6.5
Roll dice, setting some aside, trying to hit a target so you can collect a scoring tile of the value or lower. Each turn all the dice of one value must be set aside and you can't already have some of this value. Plenty of scope for tragic failures here.

You can steal a tile from the top of an opponent's pile if you roll the exact number shown, but can pick up tiles from the common pool by rolling higher or equal. Failures cause you to return a scoring tile and remove one from the board

This game plays longer but gives at least the illusion of more control that Suchizock which is its close cousin/competitor. Good to keep both for a rotation.

Big random swings when played with 2, can be quite tense. With 3, a really great filler to pad gaps between games, or while wrangling kids.

Played a couple of times with the wife - once wrong (we were not turning over the top domino when someone crapped out so the game was interminable) and once right.  The Right time made it a very fun game.  I/we are fans of push-your-luck dice rolling.  I think the kids will like this one.

Easy , simple, very luck based and light. You can calculate odds of rolling a set of numbers, but the game ends up being very luck based. However, it can be fun with the right people. It is interesting how the theme is related to the game. Nothing whatsoever to do with it.

Nevertheless, another Knizia game that is a good filler. Won't pull it out all of the time, but won't turn it down either.

Played this game with 6 and it was a little tedious. 

It gets a 0.5 upgrade because my gf likes it a lot.

Bumped it another 0.5 on 12/19/10...

RATING: 4
Even as a mindless, beer & pretzels dice game, I find it rather lacking. It's push your luck only in the most restricted sense: your turn will end between 3-6 throws of the dice, and more often than not you won't get anything. The "stealing" mechanic works OK and gives you something to roll towards rather than just aiming for high numbers, but the fact that the likelihood of getting a combo higher than around 27-35 is slim to none means that most of those nifty little dominoes function mainly as a game-clock rather than scoring opportunities.

With other push your luck designs that have survived through the years, there's always the *opportunity* to push yourself super far, which is usually the draw of the game (cf. Farkle and it's ilk). With Pickomino, however, that simply isn't the case, and the game suffers from it. You could absolutely do better than this.

I like push your luck games, and this is definately one of the better ones.  The game adds a little extra flavor, since you are not always trying for the highest number.  Sometimes the best option is try grabing a tile from someone else.

I played several times at WBC 2005, but never with more than 3 players.  Since failing to roll has little effect when you don't have a tile, I wonder if a few people going bust earily can cause the game to end too quickly?

Reiner Knizia push-your-luck dice game where you collect and steal dominos. There's a decent amount of choices each turn. The chicken / worm theme is of course pasted-on, but it makes for a light theme that's easily palatable to young players. The components - the custom wooden dice and bakelite domino tiles are fantastic. You may want to add a dice cup. Makes for a satisfying 30 minute filler to scratch that dice itch.

Yatzee for Eurogamers. Or Candyland for Geeks who are swayed by really great components (and I am one of those!) I'm not a heavy-game-snob (or maybe I am)... I do think "light" can be fun-- but there should be some tension in the choices even (or especially) in light filler. Here, the decisions to be made are extremely obvious and the "press your luck" element is not very pressing.If you are going to be rewarded for taking risk, it should have some bearing on the outcome (think Formula De.) But if that "reward" can capriciously be taken back on the next turn it just isn't fun. Having said all that, the game is beautiful. The tiles look and feel great and the box is small and cute. If it were the only game around I'd play it, especially with young children (old enough to do the math) or people who only do light games (Aunt Bessy anyone.) But with other filler choices, I'd skip. It would get a 3.5 if the game didn't look so dang nice. I'm a sucker for aesthetics.

My cousin turned this into a drinking game (of course ;-) but even without the take-a-shot-if-you-fumble-the-dice rule it's a good party game. If there are a lot of people playing, though, there can be a lot of downtime between turns and depending on your crowd, folks might lose interest. Probably best with 3 to 5 who like push-your-luck betting and aren't given to AP.

There are a lot of interesting things going on in this game, from the way that players go bust, to the way that they take tiles, to the way that the game has a built-in timer to prevent it from lasting longer than its welcome.  That being said, though, I would probably prefer to play this with fewer players, just to keep the time between turns down, since there's virtually nothing you can do while other people are playing their turn.

Interestingly, I find that this game shares some similarities with Risk Express, especially in the way that players who aren't leading are better off trying to take something from someone else than taking something from the middle of the table.  At least in Heckmeck the game ends before it gets too too tiresome.

One of Allison and my favorite dice games.  No score pads necessary here (yay!)--just count up your stack of dominoes at the end.

This is "fast-paced" only if it's your turn to roll the dice.  Otherwise you've got nothing to do but heckle the active player.  This might be fine if there are only three or four other players, but in a game for seven it long outlasted its welcome.

I love quick dice games. But i'dd suggest Sushizock im Gockelwok (or 'Geharrewar in de sushi-bar' as its called in the netherlands).
Pickomino is more press-your-luck based and a little slower to play due to more dice being rolled. It also has limited options compared to Sushizock. Both a fun and easy to learn tho.

Played several times on BSW (with 2 to 5 players). There is more in this game that it seems at first, but I am still unsure about how I should rate it (which must explain why I have changed its rating so often). The downtime and sheer luck are the main issues, and there are better push-your-luck dice games (Can't Stop, Exxtra) on both accounts. However, it is not too bad with few players.

Nice and fast dice rolling game, kind of reminds me of Farkle. We appreciate the solid worm tiles and it is fun to roll so many dice when playing with kids or in public. It is also kind of a group game as the favoured tiles with four worms quickly get discharged if someone pushed his luck too hard. Stealing worm tiles from other players makes the game quite competitive. Too much downtime for my liking if played with five or more players but still works as a light party game. Kind of a classic for me, but nothing really special as the core mechanism is not new at all and the theme is kind of dull.

Very luck heavy, even for a dice game.  Still fun, and the components are ideal for playing outdoors.

Reminds me a little bit of Can't Stop, but with more interaction between players. Luck is a big factor.

Fun dice game. Slightly brain-burny when you're deciding which combination of dice you need to hit which number.

Great quicky game that anyone can learn to play in seconds.  Very popular with younger players and teaches them simple strategy choices in order to get the most helpings from the barbecue.

Easy, Yahtzee-Style dice game where you are playing as birds trying to get the best worms. Your dice have to match the numbers of the worms in the center of the table so you can take them, or you can steal one from your opponents but only if you roll at least one worm and are able to put aside different sided dice every time you roll.
Good as a filler or after some heavy games.

Not a bad little game with the kids, although my youngest (age 5) can become a little emotional because of cruel and dramatic swings of luck.

Not so stellar press-your-luck game.  Great with 1st and 2nd graders for teaching risk management and addition skills.

What an odd, dice-festy game. A few push-your-luck elements, and vaguely familiar of Cosmic Wimpout, but with some additional tweaks. Expect to spend a lot of turns simply passing dice to the person on your left, or having someone else steal a tile you finally got after 4 wasted turns. I'd play again, with booze, and it would fill the beer n' pretzel niche well.

This is a good filler, and (small) party game, but mainly a great family game. At its core it's a push your luck dice game, and a Yahtzee variant, but with some neat twists. Such as the take-that element of stealing scoring tiles from each other, or burning the worms on the grill. This is another winner in Zoch Verlag's chicken series.

Simple "push your luck" game, too long for what it is. With 2 players Sushizock is better, but with larger groups it can be a very good gateway game. Only one big flaw: a risk of stalling when players keep stealing the same tile over and over.

A push your luck dice rolling game that is only slightly less dull than Can't Stop.  At first I thought it was very similar to To Court the King, however, upon reflection, besides the fact that you have to set aside at least a die after each roll, they aren't at all alike.  I guess I did found a tiny amount of strategy in the value vs. the number of dice to keep, but not enough to keep my interest in the long run.

You roll some dice to try to get take some numbers tiles that also have a different amount of worms pictured on them. The higest numbers tiles also has the largest amount of worms on them, and the worms is your points at the end of the game. 

Most of the time it obvious what you should do. The only fun thing in the game is to try to roll for high numbers, but each time during the game that a player is unsuccessful in getting tile, the highest mumber tile is removed from the game. So the longer you play the less existing the game gets, until the excitement level reach zero and the game finally ends.

Why all the Pickomino hate?  It's a FRICKIN' DICE GAME, of course there's going to be luck!  I didn't think much of it at first, but after a few plays some nuances came to the fold.  Like stopping at a particular time when I can easily press on just to snake an opponents' top tile, or choosing a particular number to do said snakeage.

Though it's possible simply to be die-hosed on your turn, there are actually some subtle strategies which can help your success.  The decisions are sometimes surprisingly agonizing.  Due to its brevity, I find myself returning to this game more than I'd have predicted.  It does get old quickly, however, if I play it several times consecutively.

After 1 Play: The bits are really nice, but they are sadly the best part of the game.  It is basically a mix of 80% chance and 10% each of basic probability and push-your-luck.

A simple game of rolling dice and pushing your luck. Feels even luckier than many other dice games and the scores are very swingy, but it's easy to teach and people tend to enjoy themselves while playing (not to mention that kids will practice some basic arithmetic when they play along).

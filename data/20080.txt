RATING: 8
Great fun!  The theme is great.  You have to plan your aqueducts and know when to stop pushing for a longer one.  If you get it right you feel a little like Archimedes.  The fact that YOU are in almost total control of your architectural-destiny helps that feeling along.

The art work is some of the most attractive in board-gaming.

The actions that you take are very simple, the only time that you have to take a decision is if you "see" more than one Master Builder. It depends very much on the initial setup of the Master Builders.

RATING: 3
Thinly disguised abstract* with many of the same Pipemania-style pathlaying mechanics (including player elimination) as enjoyable lightweights Tsuro and Indigo. However, unlike those two, this one takes an hour and is stodgy as all hell. Avoid.

* We're workers building aqueducts in Rome, but they don't have to actually go to any cities or make any sense, and we can only build sections based on plans held by GIGANTIC architects standing in cardinal compass directions.

Ελαφρύ και γρήγορο παιχνίδι τοποθέτησης πλακιδίων (tile placement) στο κοινό ταμπλό. Υποτίθεται πως φτιάχνουμε αγωγούς υδροδότησης στην αρχαία Ρώμη :what: αλλά στην πράξη το theme είναι τελείως επιδερμικό. Κάθε παίκτης ξεκινάει με 3-4 εργάτες και τοποθετεί ένα πλακάκι κάθε γύρα φτιάχνοντας έτσι αυλάκια για το νερό. 

Όταν κάποια στιγμή το αυλάκι βρει τοίχο, σκοράρεις πόντους ίσους με το μέγεθος του και αφαιρείς τον εργάτη σου. Μόλις σκοράρουν όλοι οι εργάτες το παιχνίδι τελειώνει και μετράμε τους πόντους. Το παιχνίδι μοιάζει σαν συνδυασμός του Carcassonne με το Tsuro. 

Το πρόβλημα του παιχνιδιού έγκειται στον βασικό μηχανισμό του με τους αρχιτέκτονες που μετακινούνται στις άκρες του ταμπλό. Αυτοί είναι που καθορίζουν τι είδους tile μπορείς να προσθέσεις στο αυλάκι σου. Το θέμα είναι πως δεν έχεις καθόλου έλεγχο πάνω τους, αφού αυτοί απλά προχωράνε κυκλικά. Ειδικά στα 4 άτομα το παιχνίδι καταντά πολύ χαοτικό και ουσιαστικά δεν έχεις επιλογές, το παιχνίδι παίζει στον αυτόματο πιλότο. Boring. :snore:

Διάρκεια παιχνιδιού λιγότερο από 1 ώρα. Τα components είναι καλής ποιότητας αλλά το κουτί μου φάνηκε αχρείαστα μεγάλο. :yuk:

An interesting concept with the builders going round the edge of the board, but the game did not grip me. The scoring system sucks though, having only one possibility of scoring each number is very restrictive and too much luck oriented. Getting rid of this completely would for me make the game far better.

{1 play, 4 players} I got completely hosed in my one play, and yet I liked it.  Like Emerald or Daytona 500, there's a lot of tactical puzzle-solving - what's my best move v. trying not to set up opponents for good moves - but unlike those other two games, you can do a little (more) advanced planning here.  There's also kind of a mini chicken game with the Traumfabrik-like scoring, which I enjoy.  And if you think I'm mentioning too many other games here, remember that I really like those other games, as well.  So assuming my opinion doesn't change with subsequent play, I put Aqua Romana in good company.

First play was a 7+ in terms of enjoyment but I'm trying to look ahead with my ratings based on replay and such.  Manageable box size.  Beautiful board and bits, really the sort of thing that would invite people to ask what you're playing - especially the oversized wooden upright master builders.  The game itself goes by quickly, and felt a bit funny to me at first having no possessions other than what simple stuff sits on the board.  Played decent with 2P, although I think 3P might be the sweet spot.  Doesn't seem like there's a ton of control, but there is still some opportunity for clever play.  Not a blockbuster or possibly worth the shelf space, but I think it's a fine game.

RATING: 6
Pretty fun game of building aqueducts and cutting people off with tiles, and has a bit of a novel mechanic in the wooden builder bits that march around the border of the board. Truth be told, though, I'm getting a little tired of tile-laying games. 'It's like a more confrontational Metro' was an exact and telling comment made during our game.

Take popular game ingredients and an appealing setting. Then add water. What you get is one hell of a pipe-laying game, and one that caught all of us by surprise.

I always wondered what makes me like Metro so much, despite the absence of meaningful forward planning, the fact that in the space of a single turn people's chances to win can be annihilated by take-that tiles from all opponents (that they just happened to draw), and the reality that the mechanism rewards negative play. It all should add up to a giant turkey, yet it has long been a welcome hit. But recently the endless row of similar looking sessions has got the better of me, and I have gone off it. And now we uncorked the Roman waterways. I suspect it will do to Metro what Metro did to Linie 1: make it sit there and gather shelf-dust.

And it's the introduction of architects which restrict the availability of tiles to the workers that has done the trick. Timely forward planning and positive constructive play are back with a vengeance, and even after a few plays it is obvious that there is a lot more under the bonnet of Aqua Romana than Metro could ever hope to offer. Yes, the "take-that" moves can still be made, but this time you know it happens because someone has been really clever, rather than just drawn the right tile when it mattered. Much more rewarding !  

The little used scoring system, in which the player matching the aquaduct-length score already claimed gets the lowest still available score instead, adds yet more spice and considerations to the mix, and that element alone has triggered some great tile plays.

Good use of bonus tiles and bonus architects are vitally important, and so is keeping an eye on which lengths are still available to score (btw, at times literally hidden by a row of architects for players on the wrong side of the board), and how great the risk is that someone will cut you off at an already claimed length en-route, Since they are the engine behind all tile placements on the board, keeping the architects where they benefit you more, or won't benefit others is crucial. Town planning indeed.

I have witnessed a session in which a seemingly lost aqueduct not only escaped beyond the rival worker in control of a seemingly hopelessly untakable blocking space, but managed to block the rival worker off at the same time, reducing it to a score of 1. It was in a planned series of 8(!) moves that first took the only available architect away stopping progress along that space, then was followed by the sacrifice of another aqueduct to gain a bonus architect, which was then brought in at the threatened location and was used to start a tile-loop that saw the threatened worker not only make a mini-loop, but return with a vengeance. Only when it was too late did it dawn on the other player what was happening. by which time the only one (!) turn in which it could have been stopped had passed. It swung the game and deservedly so.

If a game enables players to plan those sort of sequences after a few games than there must be lot more under the bonnet. Works great with 2 and 3, but a 4 player game is quite crowded and tips towards uncontrollable. Looking forward to its next outings, with any number of players though. Great fun, for families and strategic gamers alike, and an impressive design from a relative newcomer to the scene. Hope there is more in the pipeline.

Abstract tile laying game with a pasted on Roman theme. There are some interesting game mechanics in play here and they make for some tough decisions throughout the game. However these decisions are few as most choices you will have are very obvious. Furthermore the board seems awfully crowded with four players and games are over in a heartbeat. Maybe it will work better with three which seems to be the sweetspot. With four players I was not very impressed. Due to the low complexity and quick playing time it is very suitable as a family game though. All the rules translations included in the game are just awfull and break the game one way or another. The only rules to be trusted are the German ones.

Too light of a game for me. I traded it away.

Halfway between Carcassonne and Alhambra, Aqua Romana is one of those games that happen to have a theme by chance, since they would work as pure abstracts too, as it’s their rules and not their theme what drives them: nonetheless, as unthematic as it is, at least Aqua Romana isn’t as anoying as most such games are, mainly thanks to it being easy and light enough to be drunk in just one gulp.

[b]Update[/b] - I haven’t played Aqua Romana for a long time and I’m not seeing me doing it for an even longer time: so during my Fall 2015 rating revise I rounded down my rating from 6,5 to 6.

A convoluted and chaotic tile-laying game that feels more like work than fun.  It feels like a more strategic version of Metro or Tsuro.  There are hefty restrictions on the type of tile (if any) you can play.  Depending on what your opponents do, the game can be very chaotic, but you still need to think several moves ahead to keep your options open and to try to stay out of your own way in addition to competing with your opponents (especially at the start).  Player pawns move and build tiles on the center of the board, and in order to build tiles, these prawns must be able to "see" one of the master builder figures (which each representing a different type of tile) that parade clockwise around the perimeter of the board.  Having only one matter builder in sight can be detrimental since you're forced to build that tile, even if it's a bad tile for you.

A somewhat strange and beefed up version of Metro!  

Players try to create convoluted networks of canals... the longer the canal, the more points it scores.  The catch is that your tile placements are limited by a common pool of engineers that rotate around the edge of the board, dictating what type of tiles can be moved in what locations.  You're always looking at which engineers you need to utilize before someone else uses them and moves them, as well as how to plan ahead for future engineer locations.  Overall, it gives a good semblance of control with a little chaos to mix things up a bit.

Overall, I thought it was alright, and would probably play it over the very similar Metro.

Great clever game this of making the longest aquaduct possible using the master builders to place the tiles shown. Beware your sneaky opponents cutting off your aquaduct early. It will usually be your own fault too as you can see exactly which master builders they can use on their go. 3 Plays.

RATING: 6.5
Metro with a twist or two thrown in.  Try to make snaky routes for points.  The longer the better, but when you score, you take up the scoring space for that number, and so if someone else comes along and scores the same amount, they go down to the next available score space.  So it rewards ending routes early.  Also, your tile choices are constrained by little architect guys moving around the board, and so you can only build pieces shown by the architect currently facing your row.  Short and reasonably fun.  Easy to learn.  Big box, though, for what it is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A tough one to judge. You are trying to make the longest routes by placing tiles like Metro or Tsuro. There is a greater feeling of being in control of your own fate and less direct oppurtunities to screw your opponent than Metro. The master builders mechanism is interesting but they do seem to gather where noone can use them so the endgame seems to involve players having no choice over their moves. A decent game but I think the Metro comparison is unavoidable and Metro just feels more exciting.

RATING: 5
Another "make your route as long as possible" game. This time you have three routes going at a time. The unique thing about this game is that there are builders on the outside of the board, each builder representing a specific tile type. To extend a route, you must pick from a builder that currently is standing on the outside of the board in the existing square's row or column. Then you take a tile corresponding that builder, build it, and rotate the builder. So there's a bit of look-ahead to see what builders will be available, and considering that all players are utilizing the same builders, so the builder you're planning on using might get used by someone else, thus rotating him and making him unavailable to you anymore. I'm not really sure why this one didn't do much for me. From reading my own notes, it sounds ok even to me, but I guess that's the problem--it was just ok.

I'd say this is a "gamers's version" of Metro, or the after Metro - "Next step" game.  It has some interesting movement mechanics and scoring system.  Both make for close games, but require some thinking.

RATING: 4
First of all, make sure you have the correct edition of the rules: my (german) edition has several omissions concerning play with 2 players and the connection of 2 aquaducts. Then remains an average game with a lot of mechanisms which incur a strong sense of déjà vu, but which in total are still somewhat surprising. The fact that you have to be quite tactical in deciding when and where to end your aquaducts (because of limited availability of pedestals) lends this game a somewhat fiendish aspect which is not immediately apparent upon reading the rules. What I did not expect was that the game is better with 2 than with 3 or 4. With increasing player number the room to manoeuvre in becomes smaller and smaller, and it becomes very easy for other players to hem in a sorry victim who can then go and do something else. With 2 players that isn't an issue, because you can use those 'blocked' players to fill the lower pedestals, while still getting a shot at the high ones. Or, in other words, there are no excluding Nash equilibria to worry about. Still, the game does not 'sparkle'; it is in fact a somewhat dull affair although the complete absence of any randomness whatsoever means that you can plan to your heart's content. It is simply not that fun to be planning about long blue lines. And in the end, I concluded that there wasn't anything to keep me coming back to, and therefore I sold off the game with some effort.

Tile Placement
Aqua Romana is a tile laying game for 2 to 4 players. During his turn a player can extend an aqueduct, close an aqueduct and earn points for closed aqueducts.
To extend an aqueduct, the player chooses a worker and the corresponding architect, play the corresponding tile, move the workers forward and move the architect ahead.

Nice little positional game. Kind of like an advanced version of Metro. The cross referencing of engineers and diggers add some thoughtful layers of complexity to standard track-tile-laying skills.
I'm not convinced there's as much control as it seems, but there are some clever over-arching strategies for maximising your opportunities.

An interesting take on the connection games. But where Metro, Tsuro and the like suffer from too much randomness, this one suffers from too much player chaos and too little control. You just cannot do the things you want, which seems a pity, since there are some clever ideas in here, most notably the scoring system that sometimes forces you to cut your losses and score early. All in all, an interesting game with some rather substantial flaws.

Players are trying to build the longest and most convoluted segments of aqueducts on a gridded game board (think Metro).  On a turn, a player uses a worker piece on the board to "spot" a boss along the row/column the worker is situated on.  The boss indicates which piece can be constructed by that worker, and once used, advances one space around the perimeter of the board (thus lining up with other workers).  Aqueducts grow gradually and eventually terminate, triggering scoring, one point per tile entered along the path.  Scoring is in diminishing Traumfrabrik fashion -   once claimed it cannot be used again and you must take the next available lowest.  Highest total score wins.  Okay game - they main decision appears to be whether you volunarily score a canal before it's ended to take a score position first.  The rest seems to play itself.  Huge box too - I'd rather stick with Metro/Iron Horse.

Played in Essen 05, a cross between Metro and Drunter und Druber, enjoyed it, good game. *** Played at home, added .5 to my rating. It works well, within its own limits. The bonus points at the game end seem tacked on, and make wonder if they are needed. Our game finished in a 3way tie. I want to play this more with fewer players, there are things to explore here. Do you go for one long channel, or keep your workers going evenly?

Comparisons to Metro are relevant, except that I find this to be a greater challenge than the predecessor.  The architects moving around the board are a task to master as they alone provide the building opportunities.  This is certainly less random than the tile drawing in Metro and while it gives you some control over your fate, it is also a way by which you can screw thy neighbor.  And well it should be.  Played the 2 player and I think the game probably shines more like that.

In spite of the errors in the English rules, which meant we played it wrong for the first couple of games, this is a very good game. It's obviously going to be compared to metro but differs mainly in the mechanism for choosing a tile - a tile can only be used with the relevant master builder in line.

Aqua Romana is an attempt to build a more strategic game on the basic framework laid by previous titles such as Metro or Tsuro - with mixed success. While the game is certainly more strategic that doesn't necessarily make it better. Even though there are no random factors involved, the game is quite chaotic at higher player counts and thus renders much of the careful strategizing moot. The race for the limited spaces on the scoring pedestal isn't without merit but doesn't really suffice to keep the game afloat by itself.

A solid game for people who like planning a few steps ahead. In fact you can't win if don't do that - you'll get stuck in a place where there's no possible move and you will be forced to watch other players gaining more and more points.

It's not a gem and I wasn't excited in any way while playing it. But it's one of those games that leave you wanting to play once more and check whether you can beat your previous score.

Roman aqueducts, baby, Roman aqueducts.  Was this the year for aqueduct games?  Aquaducts and Vikings.  A more thoughtful Metro is how I would summarize this.

Közepes játéknak minősíteném. Párat játszottunk vele, de nagyon nem keltette fel az érdeklődésünket. Vízvezetékeket építünk az ókori Rómában, de csak ott tudunk és olyan vízvezetéket építeni, ahol a mester az oldalvonalnál áll. Márpedig a vízvezeték szerelőket a többiek is léptetik, így nehéz tervezni, sőt ha magunknak nem tudunk lépni, de az ellenfélnek igen, akkor kötelező lépni neki. Szóval van benne egy-két szokatlan ötlet, de nekem nem jött be. Igazából nem is értem az év játéka díjra való jelölését. Arról nem is beszélve, hogy sokkal kisebb dobozban, sokkal kevesebb pénzért kellene árulni, mert bőven meg lehetne kevesebből is oldani.

Appears quite random, Metro style but there is a fine act of balancing your acts of when to shut down an aqueduct and when to keep building on due to way scoring works. 

The crosses will also often run out and therefore these become very strong in the end game as the builders all of a sudden become wilds.

Played once, won't play again for the same reasons I won't play Metro or Tsuro again unless there's nothing else to do.

After a handful of plays, I have to give the game a 6.  Lots to think about, but I find that the endgame is lacking.

Once the game gets down to only two players, it seems to bog down to "I can't see a Master Builder, so I'm going to screw with my opponent"... and the Master Builders end up getting lined up in a row so no player has any line-of-sight, and no one wants to give in.

The comparison to Metro is obvious, but I like this game better.  In Metro, you draw tiles and place your best of two - with zillions of permutations creating crazy runs.  This is much more straightforward.  There is just a single path or two running through the center of the edge of the tile.  The very clever innovation is the way tiles are drawn - based on the movement of pieces on the perimeter of the board which dictate what can be built and where.  This adds an interesting planning element to the game as you try to anticipate where these pieces will be, when they'll get there, and attempt to position your tile placements to take best advantage.

Aqua Romana takes the basic idea from [gameid=559] or [gameid=1597]. On a square grid players lay tiles to advance their aqueducts until they hit a border, are cut off or voluntarily ended. Contrary to its inspirations, the tiles are not drawn randomly. They come in four different forms and only can be laid to continue an aqueduct if the dedicated aqueduct worker has a line of sight to a builder of the respective type. The builders move along the border when they are used.

The result is an interesting multiplayer abstract with the usual problem of this type of game. If players move jointly against another player, he'll stand no chance. Nonetheless, the simple rules open up rewarding decisions and more depth than the predecessors.

A nasty-ish type tile-laying game. It feels like playing Carcassonne with only the roads, although the masterbuilders give the illusion of some control to the game. 

The biggest WTF?!? for me in this game was the controlling of other player's pawns. If a player doesn't plan well enough to have a valid move on his turn, he/she almost always get to kill another player's pawn. Talk about rewarding poor play!

I was told that this is a "thinking man's Metro" and that seems a fitting moniker for this quirky tile-laying game.  But, I'd probably prefer calling it a "thinking man's Tsuro".  It's more enjoyable than Metro/Tsuro because it's a longer middleweight game.

RATING: 5
One seeks to extend their aqueducts as long as possible on the board (a la Metro).  However, extending aquaducts are limited to master builders which are in line of sight of the engineers.  There are 4 different types of master builders which build different types of "track" and one that is a joker (wild).  The other catch in scoring and extending one's aqueducts is that except for two 7s and two 3s, track length scoring can only be had by one engineer.  Therefore, if some other engineer scored an 8 length aqueduct first, another 8 length aqueduct can score 7 at best (the engineer is placed on the next available spot below 8).

Yeah, Romans seems to have had to fill their gardens with weird-inefficient-entangled-disconnected, in order to supply water.

It's small-abstract tile laying game. You can screw others not only by blocking their routes, but also by getting into score track. To extend your route you should use going-round builders, and they should be at right angle from your worker. It is interesting concept, but irrelevant to theme, and makes things chaotic.

One play, enjoyed it. The system seems to work, need to play more. The game seems optimal for four players only. I played with three: then there is an unequal space on the board distribution and fewer build masters for the one player who doesn't have someone sitting on the opposite side of the board. With two you play two colours, which I find suboptimal usually.

RATING: 1.5
For all the potential, I hoped the aquaducts at the end would be in neat, criss-crossing lines rather than a set of spoiling tile placements which for me ruined the sole game I played & made me feel like a "bit" in a bad game of "Tron". For all how it looks, I'd rather play Tsuro & have a laugh than re-visit this.

Not bad. A step more complicated than Metro, it's not just placing tiles - the game takes a lot more forward planning than that. Still, with four players it's pretty much total chaos, and with two it gets boring. Three might be - once again - the sweet spot. However, I'm not too eager to try it out.

Indifferent.

Sixty minutes of "mine is longer than yours", which I could just as easily play by standing in the mens' room for an hour.  Awkward, inelegant and painfully abstract (if Rome needs fresh water, why do all these aqueducts have dead ends?).

It looks like I played with the wrong rules ("the wrong rules" being the ones that, you know, come with the game).  I originally rated this game a 4, but since I apparently didn't play it correctly, I won't rate it at all.

A delightful geometric tile-layer which goes to great pains to provide different challenges for different numbers of players.

Aqua Romana bears close resemblance to Metro and Tsuro. Players take turns laying tiles into a regular grid, extending canals. Paths that exit the board or are blocked are scored - the sum of all your canals is your total. The game is interesting because your available tiles are dictated by specialists that move around the edge of the board.

Aqua Romana looks pretty, and is very easy to teach and learn. There is plenty of scope for "take that" play and aggression. Four experienced players should finish in around 30 minutes.

RATING: 5
Difficult game to rate. Path/tile-laying games make up a pleasant game category in which there are several nice designs (Carcassonne being the dominant title). Among equals Aqua Romana feels abstract, constrained, chaotic and not very (wait for it...) elegant. That being said I must say that I vastly prefer the 2 player game over the 4 player game (still have to try 3 player). With 4 players all the ugly characteristics mentioned are brought out in full daylight and I would rate that no more than a 3. The two player game with less players and a more interesting setup makes for a much more pleasant experience and is something I'd rate 6. Still, in spite of all the water your supposed to be transport in Aqua Romana, it's very dry (Pun, eh? Funnneee!) and there are several other games I'd rather be playing.

RATING: 7
Excellent tile laying game, good quality large board and components. Unusual master builder mechanic that adds strategic depth and a certain amount of uncontrollability as to where you can take your aqueducts. The limited scoring spaces are a nice touch and forces players to go for the long ones.

It's basically a bit more advanced version of Metro.  There's much more strategy than Metro, but Metro is more fun.  There's more options than Metro, but less ways to screw your neighbor.  This is quite girlfriend/wife-friendly, played well with 3.  Quite a fast paced game.  There's a tad of that push-your-luck element to it which is nice.

I picked up Aqua Romana quite a while ago and played it a couple of times.  It's more of a puzzle game that is abstracted from it's theme.  It's like a kind of 'pipe dream' game, where players attempt to create the longest string of tiles based on their starting positions and what is avaialable on their turn.

It feels very programmed, and as such, I feel the game would have been better if it were re-themed to something along the lines of circuitry or so.  The theme just doesn't really fit with the flow of gameplay.  [i](Whaddya mean I can't build a straight line of pipe?  I'm building an aqueduct here!!)[/i]

Anyways, it's a fair game for what it is but it could easily be traded away.  A close comparison would be Metro, although the titles are different in execution, the goals are similar.

I've enjoyed Streetcar and Metro, both which are similar route laying games. Both of those depend on the tile draw to determine how you build. 
Aqua Romana relies on managing the builder locations which determines the tile you can use to build and extend the aqueduct. This provides a much different effect which made this game a worthwhile addition to a tile laying genre.
Like the scoring mechanism that the first to complete gets the number, late comers get moved down the scoring chart.

Prefer Aqua Romana with fewer players (seems to be a solid 2 player game), and Metro/streetcar with more players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Chaotic and random.  Not necessarily things I like in a game, but the presentation (board art, tiles, and builders) make this much more enjoyable.  Prefer the new Cable Car game to Aqua Romana.

Edit: I need to get this one to the table again.  Somehow I missed the rule that you may voluntarily stop your own aquaduct to score points.  This will make a big difference and should affect rating.

Like an advanced 'Metro'. Extend your aquaducts & block your opponents. Which ones you extend & how depends on the master builders around the perimeter of the board. Limited spaces on the score track means it's important to know when to score your aquaduct. Mis-time this & you may find your supposed points score is actually less. Clever fun.

I went into this game hoping for a more advanced version of Tsuro. I got exactly what I wanted so I'm fairly pleased with my overall experience. There still isn't a whole lot going on in the game. The way master builders move and new ones come out seems a little odd, as the outer track of the board can get too crowded or workers will sometimes use the same master builder many turns in a row.
Overall: The game delivered everything I had hoped, but perhaps not enough to really impress me. Will play occasionally if suggested.

RATING: 7
The citizens of the early Roman empire lack a substantial part of life: drinking water. Experienced architects and their workers take up the challenge and build the monumental Roman water system: the aqueducts.

It's not always easy, since the architects need to oversee many building sites at one time. Therefore, not all water pipes can be completed. Plan ahead such that your workers build the longest aqueducts to earn the most fame at the end. During his turn a player can extend an aqueduct with tile laying, close an aqueduct and earn points for closed aqueducts. To extend an aqueduct, the player chooses a worker and the corresponding architect, play the corresponding tile, move the workers forward and move the architect ahead. An aqueduct is closed when it ends at the side of the gameboard or a non-fitting neighboring tile. A closed aqueduct yields 1 point for every tile it is long. If an aqueduct crosses a tile for the second time, it yields two points. The game ends when no tile can be played for an entire round. Winner is the player with the most points.

This looks complecated, but is really simple and light.  Recommended.

Aqua Romana -- Played once; three-player.

This is the kind of game Rich grasps innately.  

In our first play, Eric and I knew that Rich would be particularly good at this sort of optimization game, so we [i]should[/i] have made an early effort to hem in at least some of Rich's expansion possibilities. Alas, we both left him far too much room uncontested. I did make a comeback in the last quarter or so, and very nearly tied Rich. He earned the win, however, due to his uncanny ability to position the master builders such that they either
a) were available only to him; 
b) were of no use to me; 
c) were detrimental to me; or
d) were detrimental to me [i]while simultaneously being my only choice![/i]

Ah, a game from the time when tile laying was cool. We played a rule wrong, so, my impression might not be the proper one. Basically you try to lay down your routes and block others, while there's some opaque mechanic governing how it all happens. While not something really outstanding (like Indigo), it's still ok. 

EDIT: fell down down the ranks as it's kinda mediocre, really. Worth one last play if it ever will happen.

Aqua Romana uses many tropes of standard route-building/tile-laying games.

If you like Aquadukt, Santiago, or Metro, you might like this pipe-building game too.  It feels a bit like Factory Fun combined with a drunken version of Waterworks.  I suppose that sounds like an insult, but it isn't necessarily.  The game was short.  It seems better and to have less constant conflict than Metro.  I think the game probably only plays well with either two or four players as three players might really pin one player in a difficult corner.

An interesting game in concept, reminding me very much of Metro. This adds in other aspects such as master builders and specific tile selection accordingly.

A road (or as in this case: aqueduct) building game with an interesting mechanic, unique scoring system and quality components. There is no luck in this game and everything revolves around tactical planning. There are decisions to be made and analysis paralysis to be avoided but I want my games to be fun and this game just isn't any fun. And I want my games to create stories, yet this game creates none (unless you consider "and then I dug a ditch left, and then I dug right, and then..." etc). The theme itself seems to be plucked out of thin air as well since the game is quite abstract, neither is "Who can dig a longest ditch?" the most thrilling theme I've ever heard of. Not a bad game by any stretch but certainly not for those who want to have fun and socialize as they play.

Wow, this game surprised me.  I figured that this would be another Metro/Linnie 1 clone, but no.  This is certainly its own dawg.  

Many fun little choices.  Outside of the beautiful components there is a fantastic game here.  You don't randomly draw tiles, you move around a number of architects building pointless canals based on the blueprints you can see, move and manipulate.  

There is also a very important component to the mechanics in this game.  Knowing when to bail out.  If someone scores a space then you get pushed back to the next open space if you tie.  When you score you also get another blueprint dude, which means the timing is essential in getting what you need.

This is a blast.  This game is pro-smoking as they secretly put cigarettes in the artwork.

We play two players & both my wife & I quite like it without being overly enthusiastic. Components & Board are high quality & the gameplay requires some planning ahead. The game plays quickly & can be over in 30mins. Possibly too much blocking for my wifes taste.

Played only once with 2 players. It's a cute game with lots of chaos. Some good ideas in a network building mechanics.

I have different feelings about this game. I like it enough to play it now and then but I just don't feel the urge to chose it. I mean I survive if someone else pick it for playing it but I doubt if I'll ever pick it myself. So it's not that I don't like the game it's more like it doesn't interest me very much. 
About its playability, I tend to do well in those abstract moves but I also think that it's more like a simple adjustment to the game than a strategy itself. This is mostly a tactical game.
The bits are decent although I don't like the wooden workers. I mean, they are decent and all but I find them awkward. "Reading" what's happening on the board is not an easy task and it's difficult to understand where to go.

I like it better with two players because the sense of control is heavier and more present.

It's not just water; it's ROMAN water!!  How... exciting?  It's a decent game, though, and quite cleverly designed.  (Yet I feel that the ancient Romans were much more efficient with their aqueduct construction than I was.)  My initial impressions are probably slightly skewed since my only experience with the games so far has been with 2 players, and I feel it would be much better as a 3- or 4-player game.  So while I wasn't blown away by the game, I did find it to be interesting and fairly fun, and do really appreciate the clever manner in which the simple design elements have been brought together.  Typical of Queen Games, the production value is top notch, with everything from the huge, nicely illustrated board to the big, chunky, wooden master builders feeling larger than life.  One thing that IS much too large (and as anyone with limited shelf space can appreciate, it drives me crazy) is the game box, which is about twice as thick as it needs to be.  Another thing that might really help this game to shine is a "shares" system, similar to that used by Cable Car.  I feel like I could put one together fairly easily by making a deck of cards and a score track, and introducing some different-coloured meeples, so I'll have to get on that.  If anything, I think it could really improve the 2-player experience.  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 6/10

Please get a proper translation before attempting to play this game!  As of June 2006, the official Queen Games translation into English will lead you seriously, game-breakingly astray, whereas the unofficial one by Charlie Paull does actually have the correct rules for making this a playable and enjoyable game.  (Most importantly, the extra tile you get to place when a master builder rounds a corner may *not* be placed in a square into which any player's aquaduct could be extended, either to extend it or block it.  Second most importantly, if you don't have a legal move to extend an aquaduct, your play is not to extend another player's aquaduct but to move a master builder.)  With the proper rules this is an enjoyable, not terribly heavy or lengthy game for four, and I haven't tried it yet for three or two.  It's nice to see the designer of "M" back with another, even greater success.

Upon reading the rules it sounded like it had great potential. In practice, it didn't work well at all. When you can place a tile, the decision tree feels too small, and when you can't place a tile, the decision tree feels too big.

For a game that has absolutely no luck this can be pretty chaotic.  So much depends on what the other players choose to do.  There is some strategy here but it is a very, very tactical game.  The bits are lovely and the game was fun.  The English translation of the rules is absolutely terrible.  Several phrases were nearly incomprehensible.  This is a good game but there are many others like it (Metro, Streetcar, even Tsuro) and it's not quite unique enough to make it truly stand out.

I like the mechanics of this game though for some people it takes them a long time to pick up the simple 3 step sequence that most goes consist of (maybe its just my parents age!) Again my kids can play it and I have been beaten by them, sometimes quite badly. We downloaded some rules as we weren't sure about other players aquaducts blocking your view of a master builder; in the end we decided that other players meeples blocked your view but not their aquaducts. It seems to work quite well. The scoring system is nice and sneaky as is the way your carefully constructed plans can be undone. This is a system that could be appleid elsewhere- I don't have many games so maybe it has?

Workers building dozens of aqueducts at a marketplace right in the middle of a Roman town, most of them leading nowhere, by staring on maps on the backs of architects that wander around half a mile away? Why are the architects ten times bigger than the workers? Where's the water coming from? Why isnt the whole town flooded already?

Utter nonsense. The mechanics are bearable though.

An oddly fiddly mechanism for allowing you to choose which tile you pick (though it seemed to actually be pretty easy to manage throughout the game) combined with a push your luck aspect of how high you try and score versus waiting too long to 'crash' them and losing out on points as the scoring spots were already taken made for a mildly diverting, if largely unmemorable game.

Not bad, but it failed to really engage me.  There's clearly more scope for planning than we indulged in, given that it was our first game.  My rating might go up if subsequent games show that planning makes the game more interesting, but it will go down if the planning just leads to analysis paralysis or planning to screw the other players (which latter unfortunately seems all too likely).

This game is in the same vein as Tsuro, Linie 1, Streetcar and metro where you build tracks around a common board hoping to link up certain objectives and score points based on connections. In the case of Aqua Romona, players are angling to build aqueducts around Rome and score points based primarily on length of the aqueducts rather than connections (such as metro or Streetcar).

The twist in the game comes from the limitation of tile placements per round that is dependent on the location of the master builders that stand around the board. This mechanic does increase the strategic element of the game. I found myself thinking about two moves ahead or even delaying certain actions to deprive my opponent the chance to engage a specific master builder. While this increases the complexity of the game, it also lengthens it. With more players, it may be much harder to control the positions of the master builders. I think the scoring track also provides another strategic element since one has to decide when to terminate a track to score points based on a first-come-first-serve scoring track. However, I am not too thrilled at this scoring mechanism. The rulebook is also a mess and the translation is of poor quality.

I am currently neutral toward the game. I like it more than metro, but not enough to land in my "to play" pile. However, this is judged primarily on a 2-player games I have played.

Metro without the screwage?  That's what I heard, but I think this game has more screwage than Metro.  Since the resources are so limited, a little screwage in this game can go a long way.  It has an interesting system, and the master architect placement is really important.  The route placement and builder arrangement certainly needs to be more dictated by the future locations of the architects than it was in my first game.  Like I said, it is interesting, and I would like to try it again sometime, but my initial impression, based on one play, is that this game has limited options.  In some games limited options narrow your focus.  In this game it seems to take away your control.

The citizens of the early Roman empire lack a substantial part of life: drinking water.

Experienced architects and their workers take up the challenge and build the monumental Roman water system: the aqueducts.

It's not always easy, since the architects need to oversee many building sites at one time. Therefore, not all water pipes can be completed.

Plan ahead such that your workers build the longest aqueducts to earn the most fame at the end.

Aqua Romana is a tile laying game for 2 to 4 players. During his turn a player can extend an aqueduct, close an aqueduct and earn points for closed aqueducts.

To extend an aqueduct, the player chooses a worker and the corresponding architect, play the corresponding tile, move the workers forward and move the architect ahead.

An aqueduct is closed when it ends at the side of the gameboard or a non-fitting neighboring tile.

A closed aqueduct yields 1 point for every tile it is long. If an aqueduct crosses a tile for the second time, it yields two points.

The game ends when no tile can be played for an entire round. Winner is the player with the most points.

This idea has been done better before (Metro), and I didn't really care all that much for the idea the first time.  Of the "create the longest maze of connected routes using straight lines, curves, and other pieces where lots of routes interconnect and screw everyone up games", I'd rank Metro first, Aqua Romana second, and Streetcar a distant third.

I noticed I have the BGG most plays for this game so I should write more about it.

I'm a big fan because of the simplicity of the system and the surprising depth that it offers.
I love: Selecting 12 pilots and seeing them improve over time
I love: Selecting my target based on the recon I have performed, and the abilities/stress of my available pilots.
I love: Choosing pilots and aircraft that I think will match the mission (and not be too shaken: Thunder I'm looking at you!)
I love: Loading out my planes with missiles and trying not to put too many eggs in one basket
I love: Running the mission, trying to deal with surprises as they happen
I love: Making "FOX ONE: WHOOOSH" noises as I fire missiles at bandits
I love: The strategic impact of every mission that affects the rest of the campaign in subtle ways.
I love: The variety of campaigns and planes available (with the *highly recommended* Carrier expansion - seriously the game feels incomplete without it)

Awesome game and always a joy to play.

HL II is a streamlined version of Hornet Leader, with quite a bit of the air-to-air combat sub-system removed, but with additions to the running of campaigns with more feedback from the results of missions to the ongoing campaign. It's an excellent solitaire game.

The PDF & Vassal format allows an affordable 'impulse buy' over the web that delivers excellent value for money. I use Vassal to play the game and use the PDFs for reference. 

With all the expansions and after playing a 3-mission Iraq 91 'skirmish' and a 15 mission Atlantic 1980 'war' I'm upgrading the rating from 9 to 10. The squadron management and pilot promotions, as well as the feedback of mission success in a long campaign really add to the experience.

And don't forget the free trial game on www.dvg.com

This is rated 10 for nostalgia, but loses a point as now it's essentially been replaced in my top ten by Hornet Leader: Carrier Air Operations.

A very fun solitaire game, I recommend it.
A lot of interesting decisions, unlike B-17 and other solo games.
Brilliant!

A gestional air wargame who plays as a card driven. After just one test game, I'm greatly impressed from the high tension of the combat phase. One of the best solitaire wargames I've ever played.

Update after 4 plays: my interest is still growing. A great solitaire wargame indeed!

Update after 8 plays: Played the full Libyan Campaign, with great satisfaction! My 12yo son started an Iraqi Campaign on himself. Definitely a solid game, thanks Dan!

Update after one full campaign: it's playable also as a coop game!

Played through the downloadable Vassal demo and thought that this was a very nice solo system.  If you're handy at making print and play games or enjoy playing boardgames via Vassal, then the $15 really is a no-brainer.  However, my print and play skills are horrid and if I HAVE to play a game on the PC, I prefer full-fledged PC games with AI's or human opponents. 

 Decision Games has placed this game and Corsair Leader into its pledge system for $30 a piece, so I think I'm going to hold out for the published  version.  (I have no experience with Decision Games pledge system so I have no idea if I'm in for a long wait or not.  Unfortunately, it looks like I probably am.

Another good solo game. Lots of randomness and thinking involved.  Getting the expansions will give this some variety.  Playing Vassal but would love to print this and play but don't know how to do it.

Fun, simple solitaire game.  It's not a simulation by any stretch of the imagination, but gives lots a thematic enjoyment.  I play this every time I can.

Hornet Leader is back with this new edition available in PDF and VASSAL format. It's overall simpler than his predecessor, for example the air-to-air side display has been removed, streamlining the air combat a lot.

RATING: 5
I enjoyed the ruleset, but I found fighting with VASSAL a little too much; maybe it would work better if I had a multiple monitor system or one of those 30" displays - there was just way too much scrolling. So I'm guessing probably a 6 for the game itself (it didn't have the variety that Thunderbolt-Apache Leader does), but I have to knock it a point personally because of unpleasant interface.

This is really a great solitaire game.  I have the vassal version which is ideal for me since I'm on the computer often, I can just pop open the file and run through a couple of missions.  Its a system actually with all the follow on games which are really modules.

You really feel like a squadron commander with the mission planning.  The combat itself is abstracted out, which is fine with me.  Plenty of decision making here with payload and pilot choices as well as direction and targeting at initial contact.  The enemy is handled well and their are plenty of random events thanks to the cards to give spice to your missions.

The price is great, I can easily add modules for a small price (compared to most board games) if I want or stick with my existing theatre's.  The replay of those is pretty good with 3 levels of gaming for each of the 3 wars depicted in this game.  For the comprable board game price I can probably choose 3 of the potential expansions which would give me plenty of new missions and wars with new planes and weapons for virtually endless replay value.

This was a lot of fun at first, but it quickly became stale.  The decisions seem obvious and it starts to feel scripted.

Very good solo game! Although it could be a simple and quick Video game - There is something more about moving chits and rolling dice that adds to the experience.

For someone who doesn't know anything about aerial combat (except knowledge gained from Top Gun) this feels like a realistic simulation of aerial battles and bombing runs.  You plan the mission carefully then you swoop in unload your payload and dart away while trying not to get shot down.  Perhaps I loose a little more expensive military equipment on my missions than would be lost in real life, but I assume that will improve as I command more missions.  Lots of fun and intense action.  The rule book could use a few more clarifications... 2007/11/05

RATING: 1
Lotta fun....assembling the dice.  Then I realized there wasn't much of a game here.  Movement just seems so strange that it's difficult to feel like you're in control.  I love looking at the dice, so it has some value....

RATING: 7
I purchased this randomly because it was touted as having an innovative game mechanic.  It did require a furious bout of assembling and then sat on my shelves for awhile as it all seemed pretty confusing and uninviting at first.  Eventually I finally read all the rules(duh) and started playing.  After a few games of deciphering the meanings of the color coded effects the game became a breeze.  I have played it now a few times with gamers, non-gamers and my eight year old and we have all enjoyed it. The game presents an interesting array of interacting elements. Your choice of which pieces to play and when doesn't feel superficial as all dice (opponents and your own) interact differently in defensive and offensive capacities.  Then when you add the dexterity component(marbles) it does make for an innovative and fun game. The fact that these games can be found for a few dollars makes it a no brainer.  Only downside is once they are constructed they will take up a good bit of space. 

Update:Probably went a little over board with original rating, as I don't "always want to play".  Taking it down one notch.

It's a wargame, except all your units are eight-sided dice.  The first version of Diceland is one of the best - solid gameplay, either one-on-one or multiplayer mayhem.

RATING: 7
Unique game with unique mechanics, and rarely boring.  The DWS set is fun and has quite a lot of variety in special powers even on one die, which can make games far more chaotic.  I might trade this particular set, though, as I like the later expansions better---they are more consistent in play, and better for team-building.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
One of the most original game idea and design I've seen. Paper dice are fighting characters, and can be rolled to be in a good position to harm enemies. Once on the table can roll on their sides to have a limited mobility.
What sucks is that I have to glue together the dice. Once done, I need a safe place to store them. Card dice are fragile. Not interested in playing it again

I love the concept, but had problems with its implementation.  I read about Diceland:Space, and decided that the rules/theme fixes were just what the doctor ordered!  So much fun to hurl those dice!

RATING: 4
I was disappointed with this.  It's an interesting idea for a game and it looks nice, but the rules were a a bit complex and vague and the gameplay didn't hold our interest.  Now I have to figure out where to store all those paper dice...

Very cool original game.  Some dexterity, but also some nice strategy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I really like the concept and implementation. What I haven't figured out: how to throw the stupid things :). I should really pull these out again soon.

This is part wargame, part dexterity game: you throw your units onto the field, and they start at whatever level they end up on. You can maneuver them around, either to "heal" them up to a higher level or just aim their weapons in a different direction. An eliminated unit spends a turn recuperating, then is ready to rejoin the battle. Fun stuff, although a little bulky to store and transport.

Definitely the weirdest "wargame" I've ever played, if it can be called that.  Interesting, but I'm not sure if I really like it.  I wonder if I should have bought Diceland: Space instead.

Storing the dice without crushing them is a complete pain in the butt.

An absolute stroke of brilliance that led to other expansions with different themes.  I first picked this one up at Origins 2002 and have worked my way through three replacement sets.  Finally figured out that using Scotch tape when making the dice added a lot of life to them.  Grab a friend and throw some dice!

RATING: 6
Better than I was expecting.  The dexterity element is minimal, although I suppose if you're REALLY precise you can significantly improve your chances.  Mainly it's a light wargame, with some CCG elements-- you really need to know your "deck" well to do well.  Still, it's maybe a little too wargamey for my tastes.  But at least it's short.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Rating based on 5 playings.  Very solid bang for the buck factor.  Quality, strength, and appearance of dice is impressive.  Game is non-collectible too, so all the units are in the box right from the start.

RATING: 5
Super-nice idea: dice that are also miniatures, coming into play by being rolled or thrown and taking shots from where they land, based on what side comes up. Unfortunately not the best set: everyone's fairly equal and hitting people comes down to luck. Space is probably a much better set.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A wonderful mix of dexterity, luck, and tactics.
The Space sets are great, too, but I still prefer the character-based sets, and this started it all.

I finally got a Horus promo die!  Sure his attacks are pitiful and he's expensive compared to the tiny fighters from the Space sets, but I had to have the full set.  Plus, yellow immunity rules!

A little bit of strategy, a little bit of blind luck, a little bit of finesse, and a little bit of violently hurling folded-cardstock dice onto the table.  It's the craziest idea yet from James Ernest.  But unlike his other crazy ideas, this one's fun to play.

I think Diceland is James Earnest&#039;s masterpiece.  (He did spend some years on it.)  So far, anyways.  The Infinite Space expansion has more variety, but the original DWS is pretty nifty too.

This is an utterly unique game that earns points with me for the cleverness of its design alone.  The way in which the orientations of the dice change based on a combination of random actions and deliberate choices is very interesting.  The actual combat itself, however, seemed less satisfying.  Ultimately, this might be a very clever set of mechanics that fails to coalesce into a game I really enjoy.

Nifty mechanic and game system that reminds me of a free Cheap Ass game that simply used 8-sdied dice. Not sure which came first...Anyway, this is fun to play when you have an empty table available a a few minutes between games.

RATING: 6
Can&#039;t say I&#039;m totally on board with this yet (seems too random) but still willing to play. I don&#039;t know what the strategy is with Dvonn either, so I have to be willing to look for it here too. Prefer Light Speed though. Anyway, the answer to where to keep the dice is in an empty 5-lb Twizzlers box; you don&#039;t spend money on storage for your Cheapass games.

James Ernest is a genius, and this is his greatest work.  This game borrows less from CCG's than miniature games in general, where units tend to have point costs to balance their power.  Rather, the game this comes closest to is marbles.  Games will be over in 10 minutes, and much of that time will be spent agonizing over which die to throw into a deadly crossfire, straining to ping an opponent's die off its strongest side, and keeping track of the score because the bodies pile up fast.  May be hard to find players among the regular board game crowd, as the game is just so different from anything else.  As others have said better, it's ahead of its time.

I loved this game from the making of the dice to the tossing of the finsihed product. Reading back thru the orgins of this game in "Chief Herman's Holiday Fun Pack" CAG030 I can see where they started with this game and the places it can be taken. If doen right CheapAss will have a potent game that can reap the benifits of thier Button Man Series as well as the unique Cheap Ass Genius.

I suspect that given a blank die template and some time this will become a creative gamers playground of new ideas and opertunity.

RATING: 6.7
Unbelievable design of combining dexterity and strategy sides of dice. Paper dice sound to be fragile, but they are not. The production and playtesting quality is highly appreciated. Nice graphics, durable and sturdy dice.It's less a luck-driven game once you are familar with your diceland army. Most of the time, the face value being thrown is less important than the choice of dice or action. The only trouble to me is to locate a suitable playing area for this game at my home. 
This edition is for introduction. I do plan to get another edition with army building element.

James Ernest once again defines the word "qwirky" with Diceland: Deep White Sea. The game consists of semi-collectible (that is, the basic game consists of a fixed set, but other expansion sets are available) octahedral stiff paper dice, about 2" per edge. These dice have comic-book style artwork and game information printed on each side, and each die represents a character. The basic goal is to be the first person to reach 50 points, which are earned by "killing" your opponent's characters. Each turn, you may throw a new character into the arena (if you have any available to throw), have one of your characters use his or her action or power, or have one of your characters move. Movement is done by rolling the dice (in the same sense that a wheel rolls, rather than the usual definition). If you throw a new character, he or she may immediately use his or her power, which may be an attack, or a special action which allows you to (as James Ernest loves doing) become a Turn Hog.

Amusing diversion that relies on jumbo (jumbotic?) war dice.

Micro Mutants remains the iconic, tip-top example of a dexterity-based killfest, so it's not clear why gamers would bother with second-tier substitutes - including Diceland.

I've only played it a couple of times so far, so take my rating with a grain of salt.  I'm amazed at the innovativeness of the design of this game and it plays far better and more compellingly than I thought it would.  I'm a lousy shot, though, when it comes to hitting dice with other dice.  Must practice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After 1 Play: Only one play, which is clearly not enough to really get the feel of this game.  I like games that try to do new and different things, and this one certainly fits that criteria.  The other game that is quite similar is Clout, but after a couple plays of that one I think this is the better game.

I've played this twice with two players now. 

The theme is good, but it takes too long because there is too much upkeep: both of my 2 player games took around 1:40 and we didn't even have time to finish. 

In the game's defense, the time didn't feel like almost two hours. 

Perhaps the game would be better and even faster with more players... (the upkeep tasks could be divided better)

For now, though, I don't see it displacing Ghost Stories as my top co-op.

RATING: 7.5
This is the premier cooperative deck builder on the market.  Marvel Legendary is way too uneven in its difficulty to make a good pure coop, and while Thunderstone Advance has released an expansion with a coop variant, Thunderstone is just not built to be a coop.  The Star Trek Deck Building Game was the top coop DBG for a while, but it's been kicked to the curb by Shadowrift, which has better replayability.

+Highly thematic game with an RPG-like feel.  You develop your deck like you would develop a character sheet.
+Innovative town deck that represents the village you are trying to protect and provides players with helpful bonuses.
+Several different monster groups with different flavors make for excellent replayability.
+Very good opportunities for player interaction and planning.

-Some minor balance issues (some player cards are clearly better than others).
-Scaling could be better.  The two-player game is rather easy, but there are lots of ways to adjust the game to add more difficulty.
-The rulebook is somewhat lacking, particularly in diagrams.
-The bridge-sized cards are kind of annoying.  I wish they were standard playing card size.

Good deckbuilder.  Played it once and thought it was very similar to other deckbuilders out there.  Our group liked it but we tend to gravitate to games with miniatures.

Changes in 2nd edition appear to have smoothed some of the balance issues and unquestionably made the game clearer in terms of rules and more streamlined during play. Glad to see such a great core game has gotten a worthy upgrade. Will probably change review up or down after more plays

RATING: 8
Great game. It'll keep your focus at all times since there's so much happening. The tension of refreshing the town, the monsters activating and causing havoc. It encourages you to be vocal with your fellow heroes to win. There's a lot to keep track of but you get the hang of it by the third round. The rulebook could have been clearer but the forums helped to shed light on any doubts.

RATING: 8
With seven plays in the first edition, the game reveals its strengths and flaws. While the co-operation is the most meaningful and interesting I've seen, there are several balance issues and pretty major "bugs".

Perhaps the second edition solves many of the problems. It would be nice if the game played the way I want it to play. Walls are a mess of rules and weird costs. Rifts are stupidly easy. Heroism is far too powerful. This game badly needs a proper re-design. If that happens, this game is an easy 9/10, because when it's great, it's a thrill of various players performing meaningful cooperative roles.

I must say that I was skeptical at first, seeing the box and looking superficially at the cards, but I was wrong. It's a brilliant little game, very tense, with great mechanics and even if the rules are not well written, I enjoyed the game so much that I decided to overlook all its flaws. Will play again and soon.

A co-op deckbuilder where you play as heroes defending a village from monsters attacking from a dark dimension (the shadowrift).  

This game has much going for it -- decent design, decent artwork, decent components, scales well with more players, good gameplay, somewhat difficult to win...

The gameplay is pretty intuitive.  There's a lot going on in a turn, which makes the game somewhat fiddly until you get finally get it.  (Keep the "Order of Play" card handy!)

The first edition rules were terrible -- hopefully further reprints have corrected this matter.

Bottom line though, the game is fun and pretty thematic.  I DO feel like I'm killing monsters and protecting a town.  I like this, and would rarely turn down a game.

One of the best co-op games, and certainly *The best* deck-building game as of 2012 -- handily beating out Thunderstone Advance for both co-op and theme, and leagues better than Marvel Legendary or any other tedious competitive/semi-co-op deck-builder.  We play with designer's suggested rules clarifications, plus cards straight to discard once used, with no 'taking back' or changes of plan once they are spent.  Would LOVE to see this get more buzz, and expansions!  :)

Cute game. Cooperative which makes it ideal when you want to have an easy *no-backstabs* kinda night, plays up to 6. The more players though, the longer the game takes and the lower the difficulty is, which can be a problem you have to address. All in all, it will definitely have its table time, just not that often..

It's nice that it is a cooperative deck builder and the communal deck being built with the villagers is a new idea that I like, however, I never felt any pressure/urgency to do anything or felt that we were close to losing.  Plus the draw another card ability on some of the cards seem to chain really easily, making pulling off big combos easy, but unfulfilling. The game was fiddly with constantly having to cycle cards, move cards, move chips and so on.  Decent game but not one I would back.

I was initially unimpressed with the game's art, components, and rule set, which seemed amateurish and messy. The whole package had all of the markings of "bad Kickstarter project" written all over it. 

What a pleasant surprise! The game is thematic, tense, deeply cooperative, and best of all, fun! The card combos are satisfying, and teamwork is necessary: often it means one poor player has to taking more of the wounds to allow the other player with the more efficient deck to handle the bulk of the combat/walls. 

Can't wait for the expansion!

Shadowrift doesn't hit the same high with me as Thunderstone, but it is an enjoyable game.  High randomness creates large swings in difficulty, but it is manageable.  Poor card quality makes shuffling more difficult than it should be.  Price is too high for what you get.

RATING: 8
I really like the mechanics of playing this game, but it's just too easy. The Explore card is the culprit - we've tried a few variants for it, but there just doesn't seem to be a good fix. Churning the monster deck, even at a much reduced level (one gold to kick a monster three slots down) is just too strong. I think the next step is to eliminate the Explore from the game entirely, and allow each player to replace it in their initial deck with one 3-cost card from the display.
---
Once you figure out the churn-n-burn strategy (basically, doing a lot of Explores and spending the coin to burn through the monster deck to get to the Shadowrifts), I think the game is probably a bit too easy. I think you'll probably want to house rule the Explore card at some point; I'm thinking of making it spend a coin to move the to card of the monster deck 4 slots down, instead of to the bottom. That way you can maybe put off some of the nasty monsters at a price, but you won't be able to rip through the monster deck the way you can now - especially at larger player counts.
---
Rating is for 2nd Edition, which has numerous small-ish but fairly critical improvements. Get the one important piece of errata, on hunting when the target isn't found.

Enjoyed this quite a bit. Can be very difficult until you get a few basic tips & tricks (Seal is super-important even if you want to go the Wall route to victory). Gives you a ton of options and very limited resources to accomplish them; you will always want to do way more than you are allowed, which is fun. Choices about resource acquisition, deck management, and when to fight are tough. Without any real deck-stacking rules it can be a bit lucky; sometimes you'll get super-dangerous monsters early and be in a lot of trouble, and sometimes the rifts will come out early or late, which can be a big deal. But the game does give you enough tools to adapt to swings, so it seems more interesting than just chaotic. Sometimes you'll lose and it's not really your fault, but all co-ops experience this to some degree. The interesting ones, anyway.

I like this with slightly larger numbers of players - 4 seems good, and you could probably play up to 6 without too much pain, since the action phase at the end is fairly simultaneous. Since the cards seem designed around setting up multi-player combos, playing with just 2 felt a little bit thin to me, but it worked fine. I probably wouldn't bother solo.

Anyway, this was a pleasant surprise. I played it at BGG.con and then subsequently on a borrowed copy, but now I'm looking forward to getting a copy myself.

An excellent Deck Building Co-op game. Very neat in the way it works. Builds up the tension and pressure on the players every turn. Makes for an exciting game with plenty of decisions to be made. Do I get these wounds out of my hand or do I make a better attack or should I buy more useful cards to make my deck better or maybe you should try and buy more villagers so you don't get your town overrun with corpses. 2 Plays

3 Player - 1 Play, 1 Win

RATING: 6
We play it two players and we love that we get to do cool things and that while we are on the same team, we actually act as individuals.

However, the game, as written, has two major flaws.

One, the titular shadowrifts. First up, going for a shadowrift victory is boring. The game has no endgame with a shadowrift victory. It's a huge struggle in the midgame and then, boom, sudden victory when the final shadowrift shows up and gets sealed right away, or, you lose to corpses. However, going for a wall victory can also be ruined when all the shadowrifts show up and get sealed. It gives a feeling of, oops I won. That is not a fun victory.

Now we play Shadowrift without the shadowrifts and I would rate it higher that way.

The other problem is that this is a rich get richer game. Killing monsters makes you more powerful making it easier to kill more monsters making you even more powerful...Also building walls brings you closer to victory while at the same time both making it less likely to lose to corpses and hindering the monsters. Resulting in, somewhere in the mid game, being far from the ending, but already knowing that you're going to win.

To note, even with those two major flaws, I still play this game, so hopefully that gives an idea of how much I appreciate the rest of it.

I love co-op games, so you need to know that from the start.  But I think this one is especially good.  It's fun and engaging, so times moves quickly when you play, and it's thematic.  I agree with those who say this is the game that Thunderstone wanted to be in terms of marrying Dominion to a proper theme.  With 2p, it does seem best to play against the Demons or the Glacien or Storm Lords.

Co-op Dominion that kicked our asses!  Really enjoyed this one on the first two plays.  My favorite aspect is how the players kind of settle into roles, such as figher/healer/support, naturally over the course of the first couple rounds as the strategry forms.  It also seems that there is enough variance in the initial card setup and how each player decides to play that each game will have its own flavor.

It seems like there's something wrong with this game, I just can't figure out exactly what since I've only tried it solo twice.  It's such a great idea, though, and has great potential in my opinion.  The rulebook is fucking horrible though.  It actually makes things worse by using different phrases for key game concepts, and tries to be too cute.  Please, the first directive for any game is to explain the rules clearly.

And up to 5 plays within 24 hours of owning it.  That is VERY rare, but this is a very fun game.  

My favorite part of the design is the way that the town you are defending is represented by an additional deck which evolves as the game goes on.  It could become a giant pile of bodies, or be full of cards that help power you up!

Another great mechanic is that the omnipresent "doom cards" that every co-op uses has cards of varying powers, but has a built in mechanic so that more powerful cards take longer to come out.  This gives a smoothness to the game lacking in most co-ops.

Many interesting choices, and more cooperation than I've seen in games before.  The fact that all players act simultaneously is genius.  I'm really impressed with this design, and I hope co-op designers look at it for the future.  A co-op that does nearly everything right in a genre I thought was doomed.

Update: This one burned hot and fast, but it petered out for us pretty quickly.  Ultimately differently plays of the game are just too similar.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It's fun and has some interesting ideas in it (I love the villager's deck) but it's unbalanced and too random with the difficulty. The shadowrifts and event cards go into the deck at random so this can make the game either very easy or very difficult. Also each scenario pretty much requires the recommended cards in order to be successful. The maker of the game should have playtested this more

I like co-ops because they feel like a puzzle.  Most devolve into one or two players telling everyone else what to do, which makes me realize that puzzles are better as solitary enjoyments.  This game encourages full player collusion, and yet I haven't had the same experience of player domination as in a game of Pandemic.  

This is because the game is also a deck-builder, and it's enough of a challenge managing your own deck mix without trying to track everyone else's deck.  I could make a few suggestions to my fellow players, but ultimately they have a better handle on what's going on in their decks.  

I also happen to like deck-builders as a genre, especially when player decks start to diverge and develop unique identities.  In this game, these deck IDs take the shape of RPG adventurers.  There could be some tightening up on this concept, but overall, I really like it.

I'm not a fan of co-ops in general, in part because of the nature of such games, and in part because there's always the person who wants to run the show. That aside, Shadwowrift felt like little more than a cooperative version of [i]Thunderstone[/i]. Not a bad game, just not for me.

RATING: 7
What I really like about this game is you are deck-building, but that's not the only focus. You take wounds (useless cards in your deck) which hurt the consistency of your deck, but you can recover from wounds without needing specific cards to allow you to get rid of them. It's also a co-op, which allows different players to take a different focus with their deck to optimize the team's effectiveness against whatever monsters/scenario you are playing. I would definitely play this again. I'm not yet sold on picking it up, however.

I like the cooperative aspect of this deck builder.  In the past, I've gotten quite excited about this one, but my interest has waned a bit with time.  That happens with me, though, so I'll re-rate if my opinion changes.  One potential con, which is a boon for replayability, is that we don't tend to buy a ton of the available cards.  This is potentially because, if we wasted resources doing this (assuming we don't have a handful of wounds), we'd probably die.  Maybe we're playing wrong...

It's alright, but honestly, it's pretty bogged down by weird nitpicky rules things that you wouldn't know unless you spend time on BGG reading the FAQ or whatever. Playing it more frequently would help with that, but it's just sort of annoying.

It's an alright game, but it really doesn't grab me.

Could force me to re assess which are my favorite deckbuilders...
First assessment though is a mixed bag.
+ : the villagers add an interesting interactive element & do reinforce tactical/light strategic thinking. Loot cards help with building a (simple) double engine : adding semi-permanent effects to the table on top of the usual engine coming from card buys.
- : all of this & the mechanics to spawn monsters might tend to lenghten the game quite significantly.

A highly thematic deckbuilder that adds some cool new things to the genre. I really like the town deck which you build up as a group and in which you have to protect the villagers. It works thematically and adds a nice element to the game.

I love the variability of the game. The different villains all have different special abilities and effects. That combined with the variable card market amkes each game feel different.

The art on the cards is great (at least on the 2nd edition I have) and the quality is also excellent. I really can't find any negatives about the game.

A co-op deck-builder in which you try to save a town from a hoard of attacking monsters. Aside from being tired of co-ops and deck-builders in general, I kinda liked it. It definitely had some neat ideas, but it was also a little too busy.

However, it is in serious need of a redesign. Just some basic principles like having card faces of different types be different colors or having non-microscopic numbers on the icons would do wonders for the playability. Some cards allow you to immediately draw a new card, and it would have been easy to have a big icon in the corner to indicate that, instead of text buried in the middle.

A deckbuilder where you make choices about how to play your hand?! Stunning! The variety is good but not great, though the unique twist to each monster deck is welcome. The difficulty balancing is suspect, but it's pretty easily malleable--though I doubt the same could be said for walls. Sealing rifts seems 100% the way to go.

Shadowrift is a purely cooperative deckbuilding game with excellent thematic flavor. There are a lot of moving parts, but it never gets bogged down in rules questions, and players really do need to work together to puzzle out the solution to the problems they face.

These problems come in the form of various beasties who set out to destroy the town and its inhabitants. Very often, players will not be able to kill every monster and so will have to choose which consequence will be the least harmful. Choosing to add cards to the deck is not really the "engine-building" experience it is in games like Dominion, and an approach of "little of this, little of that" can work just as well as a clean, streamlined deck. 

The cards are printed on very thick and glossy stock, which is about as nice as you can get for a small publisher like this (face it, they aren't going to be a linen finish.) The graphic design is functional, but dated, hearkening more towards MS Paint than Photoshop. The illustrations vary from excellent to tolerable, but nothing is glaringly bad. The boring graphic design and the variance in the artwork doesn't really do a good job of creating a cohesive feel. Fortunately, the gameplay generally makes up for this.

This is one of the most enjoyable co-op experiences I have had. I wish this game got more attention, as I feel the designer and publisher really did everything they could to put out a quality product. It's really a success everywhere except graphically. While Rune Age offers some very fun co-op scenarios, having Shadowrift  be wholly devoted to co-op really deepens the experience.

Co-op Defend the Village from Monsters!
Multiple decks builder:
- your (each hero's) deck, buying more goods & spells from the central shop.
- the village's deck, paying to get good new citizens and trying to kick bad invading citizens out.
- the monster's deck, with a set of areas they go through that trigger various monsters behaviours...
Seal the Rifts, or build enough walls to keep the village safe, before all citizens are killed, or you are killed, or a lethal monster makes it to the last area.

Seems like a great concept with plenty of variety. But be warned the rules are totally inadequate to play out of the box and my group resorted to watching BGG videos to get started.

This is my group's favorite coop game, and I'd have to agree. The deck building is done very well and scratches an itch no other coop does for me. Some of the enemies haven't been properly balanced to play well with all numbers of players, which sucks the fun out of the game the first time you run into the problem. Once you know what enemies to play depending on your player count, everything works great.

Also, the card stock is a little flimsy. We've played the game maybe 8 times and the cards are already getting pretty chipped up on the sides.

Great game but a little chaotic. We played with the first edition. Maybe the best thematic DBG I had play. The mechanic of micro deck building for the village is awesome. Juego con mucho potencial pero cuya presentación está un poco desorganizada. Creo que la segunda edición mejoró muchos aspectos. Llegó un punto en el juego en que los monstruos salían a atacar en manadas y rápidamente y sin embargo terminamos ganando el juego sin saber exactamente cómo lo logramos.

Gives Valley of the Kings a run for its money as the best deckbuilder in my opinion. Hands down the best co-operative deckbuilder, and I'd be tempted to say "best co-operative game" had I not also played T.I.M.E. Stories and 7th Continent.

The second edition has fantastic production values, and a couple expansions out already, which makes it even more excellent and adds massively to replayability. 

Since I backed the 2nd-ed game, my 1st edition copy is now up for trade, but that's the only reason.

i hate deckbuilders and this one is way to hard. This game makes ghost stories seem like a cake walk. There is also too much randomness on success or fail. you can have a game where the rift all show up within the first 10 cards of the game making it an auto loss. There needs to be a setup that seperates them in the enemy deck. Also to close a rift you need a seal and another magic card. I can tell you its all luck closing the rift, Ive had more events where i drew the seal without another magic than with one. Horrible mechanism. 

the dumbest rule by far is taking a wound whenever you attack. Wounds get cluttered so fast its impossible to build a deck. I played a game without this mechanism and we still lost imagine how bad it is with taking wounds. 

the game also does not scale properly, its easier with more players because the only "scaling" mechanism is adding 1 power per player. 

lastly, one of the worst rule books EVER ... I suggest to watch runthroughs because it is impossible to play correctly reading these rules

This is a game I'm particularly happy to be able to work on (2nd Edition). I reckon this is a really smart and innovative deck building game. One that uses the concept of decks and hands in some of the most innovative and thematic ways I've seen. Firstly, you each are building decks that shape your character (to what you could imagine was a fighter, or wizard or thief, or whatever!) and it makes a lot of sense thematically and mechanically, because having players with different decks really makes the party work better as a whole. Second, the Town deck, and the way that works is thematic and interesting mechanically: the travellers, infiltrators and corpses that get added to that deck work perfectly. And third, the 6 different monster groups that attack the town work with the other mechanics in really interesting ways. Such as the way the Necromancers take advantage of corpses within your town. Because of all those things it is also a really slick co-op game, the simultaneous play is great, and it genuinely feels like you are a team.

First version, a pleasant (and decent) solo -2 handed- experience, very thematic as well. played it 3 times now (Drow - Demons - Necromancers) and won every scenario rather easily (I missed the hunting rule totally!!! so there is no chance that my victories are legal). It scales very well also and I love how different its time looks based on the scenario BUT I will wait until I play every scenario and couple of random ones to give my final verdict. Huge plus is the small box (the smallest I have ever seen for a card game of its size) which makes it easy to carry and play on vacation. Love the (1st version) artwork too!
Initial rating 8.0 (December 2015).

A surprisingly good co-op deckbuilding game. We played it accompanied by the designer. Aside from being rather long (which I expect could be tweaked), it was fun and engaging the entire time.

This game is really great.  Just grabbed the second edition on sale no less and it delivered fantastically.   I did my homework on this game beforehand and what I can tell is everything I heard the game needed was addressed in this second edition.     

For me this delivered at a greater level than Thunderstone Advance.  The theme was great, the art was really cool, and the gameplay was tense... it conveys danger from monsters which felt great.  New fan.  hoping to catch some of the expansions soon ????.

Haven Town is facing total annihilation at the hands (and teeth) of a horde of monsters from beyond the Shadowrift.

You the heroes must band together to drive them back. To do this, you will need powerful spells, skills, attacks and loot. When the game begins, you are a basic hero; you can explore and fight. Lucky for you, this is a deckbuilding game! You can buy new cards to add to your deck - cards which will define you as an adventurer and complement the strengths of your fellow heroes.

It's a village defense deck building game with interesting mechanics that could be reused in other game. The game seems to have more depth than other defense deck building game, but I am really not sure about the theme.

Also seems very cooperative , so not sure how it would feel in a solitaire game. While in cooperative game, there could be quarterbacking. Seems to have a lot of similarities with dominion for the action system.

RATING: 7
While initially concerned by Tom Vasel describing this game as fiddly and while I agree with Mr. Anderson that this game is not to be played solo, I have found that designating different people to refresh town, travelling villagers, monster power etc. has made this game not too fiddly. 

The deck building is not as strong as say Dominion as you will gain a lot of heroism cards over the course of the game just by killing stuff, however I feel like at least in the early game there are still "roles" that you can specialize in (fighter, "mage", etc.), as for example most spells have greater effect if you discard other spells for magic (later in the game specialization is less important because heroism is basically almighty). 

I really enjoy that every time a monster advances something bad happens to the group. One of my issues with Legendary was that most of the time there was little penalty for having villains escape let alone advance through town, and this game fixes that.

This game seems on the easy side (currently 8 wins and 2 losses). This makes it a bit boring to play with my genius roommate, but with inexperienced gamers it is fun to watch everyone freak out as we almost die only to pull off a last minute victory when the last Shadowrift shows up. Will definitely try some of the harder variants people have come up with soon.

EDIT: My opinion of this game has waned a bit over time as this game seems to try to do too much but falls flat in certain regards. As I said before the deckbuilding isn't that strong, all the card refreshing and the simultaneous turns makes this game not very accessible to beginners  while its decisions feel restrictive to veterans, and there is a lot of luck that can't be mitigated.

Other random thoughts: The different enemy factions feel reasonably different. Priest is overpowered when playing with 2-3 people. Rulebook needs some work. Cards have a nice waxy finish to them but come stuck together, and after 10 plays their edges are getting pretty beat up. Box insert is basically nonexistent but I really like the compactness due to having to move my games back and forth between college and my house.

this game is not innovative by itself, but mixes lots of deckbuilding games from these days in an interesting mixture; this game is like if you take Thunderstone and Ascention in a blender at high set! 

The game art could be better, but is ok, the concept of the game is great; a deckbuilding were all players co-op to battle a common enemy, be zombies, dragons, etc and moving to close the shadowrift (portals to a evil dimension) 

the game itself feels chaotic during game and since there is no super-win some could be limited to support options while others take the glory. 

If you are a RPG gamer, mostly dungeon crawler, this would be a great addition to your game collection.

I think I like cooperative deck building better than competitive deck building.  There is a richer choice of actions than in a traditional co-op, and you feel more like a team as you play off each others cards and actions.  Fairly intuitive if you have any familiarity with role playing games.

Fantasy themes aren't my favorite, but this one is well implemented.

This is a fantastic cooperative deck-builder with a very strong theme and good decisions.  I particularly like how all of the cards make thematic sense.  Once you know it, it plays smoothly and it's fun how you work together at all times as "turns" aren't really a concept.  The only problem is that the game seems a bit too easy, at least with 2 players.

"Very thematic deck management co-op. As a deckbuilder, it is unusual in that your deck does not get stronger and stronger. It just focuses on certain activities. 3p felt difficult, but our strategy was probably weak. Solo felt like a long slog, without a lot of tension. Hopefully further plays will be better. "

What I like:
- Theme and mechanisms work really well together
- Three currencies
- Small(ish) box
- Turnless simultaneous play gives flexibility

What I don't like:
- Monsters have a lot of hit points; no attack can do more than 3
- One action feels a bit restrictive, but not terrible
- Cards seem like they will show wear quickly
- Turnless simultaneous play can be confusing

I want to like this game more than I do after just one play 3p and one solo variant play. There are so many things to like. The daunting relentless onslaught of monsters with tons of hit points was off-putting. But I'm definitely willing to give it more chances before giving up on it. 

I would put the weight around 2.5, so near the BGG-voted weight. My first 3p game took 70 minutes after setup.

All of the individual pieces are reasonable, but it's quite a strange mashup that failed to grab me. As with many deckbuilders other than Dominion, the correct way to play your turn is usually clear  (up to the point where you're deciding what to buy), and that's a shame.

Shadowrift is a fully cooperative deckbuilding game in which players are trying to seal the rifts before the town is overrun with monsters and all of the villagers die.  Each turn, new monsters may come out depending on how much income the game has, and they traverse across a track, activating different abilities on each spot.  If they make it all the way across the track, the game's income increases, which causes monsters to come out faster.  Mixed in with the monsters are Shadowrift cards, which can be shut down if players buy Seal cards and allow the players to win the game.  On the player turns, they are trying to buy cards to kill the monsters as well as Seals to shut down the rifts.  Players can also interact with the townspeople, which is kind of like a communally-controlled deck that can be built as well.  However, monsters can kill the townspeople, replacing them with corpses, and if all corpses are flipped in a hand the players lose.  I'm not a huge cooperative fan anyway, but I thought this one was worse than most.  It is incredibly susceptible to the "alpha player" problem, as nothing mitigates it and in fact, the lack of a player turn order and the necessity of players to specialize in specific ways in fact encourages it.  I particularly didn't like the lack of a player order, as that just made everything really chaotic as everyone attempted to talk over one another.

Fun game!  Challenging scenarios each plays differently.  My group is always wanting me to bring it to the table.  A lot of card piles on the table (made my own paper board) made it a little confusing at first.  But once you get the hang of it (doesn't take long) I'm sure you will enjoy.

Biggest downsides is there seems to be quite a bit of shuffling between the various decks.  And game play can get a bit length (1.5 hrs at max)

Good lord is this game hard!  We struggled through two 2-p games, and after both, we were both fairly convinced that winning would have a lot to do with luck...perhaps almost a bit too much to do with luck, as a matter of fact.  
That said, it IS fun, but purely in a masochistic way.  I love a challenge, and Shadowrift delivers.  Great idea with the town/villagers deck.  

Update:  Ah, okay, we really beefed a rule.  Easier on the replay, but what's odd is that it didn't every really feel like our town was in much danger.  It really was just a matter of cycling the monster deck and closing Shadowrifts.  So, my first complaint when we were doing it wrong was that it was too hard...now, it is almost too easy.  HATE the fact that the cards pretty much require sleeves.  No excuse for cardstock that thin in a deckbuilder...they demand constant reshuffling.  Give me linen or give me death.

At first I thought it was a great beginning, thinking that this might be what Pathfinder Card Game was supposed to be for me.  However in the end the game just got extremely fiddle, with 10 monsters out and trying to determine what each one did at various stages.  Just got to bogged down.  Lack of player order also felt a bit of a free-for-all.  Would play again, but only if someone really insisted on it.

Very solid deckbuilder.  The art and layout of the cards could use some work, but hopefully the 2nd edition will take care of that.  Also, the rulebook leaves a fair amount to be desired, though again the 2nd edition may fix this.

As for game play, we played with 2 players and lost, but we enjoyed every minute of it.  We learned enough that next play through we may not win, but we will play better until we finally do win.

Interesting co-op deck builder. Counter-intuitively, victory tends to come from economic engines going into overdrive rather than anything relating to monster-slaying. Defeat is similarly anti-climactic, with a single bad shuffle of a deck that requires constant tending pulling down the curtain on your game abruptly. Enough choices, tension, not a lot of great combos, usually the board will only reveal a couple of obviously superlative cards or combos, but nothing is all that interesting. You don't have that long to think anyway with the Ghost Stories style hordes kicking down your door.

Fun. Balance feels iffy though.

An interesting deckbuilder, most reminiscent of Thunderstone, but cooperative, which adds some new thinking to the game.  The monsters and cards to buy seem to have nice variety, but it does seem to lack ways of removing the initial cards from your deck.

RATING: 6.5
Cooperative deckbuilder. Such a cool premise. There are definitely some things about this game I would change, like maybe some of the cards are priced a bit too high for what they do. Spending 5 might, and 3 gold on a card that just deals one extra melee damage, is pretty crazy when you can build a wall for the same price. In all the games I've played so far, I rarely bought any cards, other than Seals and Gold, and since Gold doesn't go into your hand, the deckbuilding aspect was a bit lacking. Still awesome to work together, I love that aspect, and the theme is integrated very well. Could probably use some tweaking to make it great.

If the target is not present, the monster will Hunt.
In 2nd Edition, using Frenzy will also prevent you from taking a Wound in that battle.
If you could manage to pay for it, you could have several frenzies out and use one wound for each of them.
Each Shadowrift in the power area adds 1 to the power collected each turn.
When paying using a Might, the Might card goes directly back to the Might stack rather than staying in play until Cleanup.

Yai, we are finally playing it. The first game is still in the pipe, but I think I can already rate.

I had to explain the rules to my boyfriend while he was really tired. xD 
Nevertheless, as soon as we played he understood easily the structure etc. Very convenient was the card including every phase of one round. 

We had one or two things to look up again, but played mostly fluent. 

Still the attack of the Fire Dragons is ongoing and to save the village I need to go. See you adventurers. ^_^

Edit: As recommended I watched radhos run through and checked BGG beforehand.

This comment only applies to the 2-player experience as that is how my wife and I play all our games.

A very thematic deck-building adventure, with an emphasis on adventure. In an interesting twist, the deck-building around your "character" is somewhat limited (you may only purchase 4-5 cards and can't thin your deck). That said, this is a virtue rather than weakness of the design as the purchase of only a few cards can truly differentiate your character. Through the acquisition of these cards, the game allows you to select you own character development path. You might choose to be a damage-dealing barbarian, a sneaky coin-gathering rogue, a spell-slinging mage, or a damage-controlling healer. Notice that I use the word character rather than deck as the deck-building mechanisms do truly make you feel like you are building a character and not some amalgamation of random loot, loosely thematic abilities, etc. Another very interesting design element is the town deck, which is actually where a greater part of the deck-building can take place as you recruit defenders and helpers (while eliminating unwelcome folks like vagrants and heretics). Truly, this game is a masterclass in thematic integration as the mechanisms and theme blend seamlessly.

Given this glowing praise, you might ask why I gave the game a 7. Well, from what I've gathered so far (I may change my mind as I continue to get more plays under my belt), the game has some pacing issues. This is a long game and you never truly feel like a story arch develops (with a build up, climactic epic battle, and eventual win or defeat). What I've found is that it is a slog-- a battle of attrition that can get downright tedious. The result is that you can often tell that you are going to win/lose with 30 minutes remaining. This might relate to the win conditions, which don't involve beating a big baddy but rather waiting it out until you have the right resources in place or card draws from the monster deck. Perhaps expansions address this. At present, this is only a decent game with the potential to be amazing if it could deliver consistently interesting and challenging experiences that are appropriately paced.

Update: the last few games have been very intense, well paced (plenty of highs and lows), and close. I think our first few plays may have been outliers. This is quickly becoming one of my favorite deck-builders.

RATING: 8
Yes, it has a terrible rulebook.  Gameplay seems like it will be very fun.  Hard to tell this early as the first couple of games are spent getting the hang of all the corner cases that spring up and aren't covered by the rules.
Update: After getting the hang of the rules, it turns out that this is a very fun co-operative deckbuilder in the style of Dominion.  It does seem to be a bit more difficult than other co-ops I have (other than the Drow).  I'm disappointed that the expansion seems to be focused on making the game even harder.

RATING: 3
A cooperative Thunderstone, that somehow manages to be more cludgy and far less fulfilling than the game it borrowed from.

For a coop that clearly wanted to tell a story, none of it made it to the final product.

I quite liked this game immediately after my first, disheartening play but the dearth of content has me concerned.

This game really plays like cooperative Thunderstone.  It is a deckbuilder where all players are working together to attack and kill monsters that progress across a 3-space track.  We do this by buying skills, loot, spells, and actions into our deck and enlisting the help of the villagers.

This game is HARD.  Perhaps it was some combination of choosing a really difficult scenario and perfect storm of events but my first game of this we lost on the 4th or 5th turn having only seen 3 of the monsters enter the game.  We played the pre-defined demon scenario and I think I identified some problems.  For example both my friend and I (we played just 2 player which might have also contributed to the difficulty) bought a few of the travelers into the town early when what I'm thinking we should have done was bolster our personal arsenals early to prepare for the inevitable onslaught of monsters.

I'm really excited to play this again, especially since I did get such a small taste the first time.  My partner was a little too browbeaten to shuffle up and try again right away though.  Like I said, I'm concerned that for a deck builder there's not a whole lot of content in this initial offering.  But I'm sure there will be expansions for me to buy in the near future to increase variety and replayability if I still enjoy it, and the high difficulty level definitely ups the replay value as well.

I like this concept very much, and for the most part, I'm quite pleased with the game. However, in my opinion (for what it's worth), the "everyone goes whenever he wants" means of turn order is simply too chaotic, and can get messy and downright confusing at times (especially for those of us with learning disabilities.) The game would benefit greatly from an organized "this player makes all of his moves, then this player makes all of her moves," type system.

Still, an excellent game, and well worth thinking about. Finally a new way to do cooperative games that works quite well and is compelling to boot. Not at all like playing multi-player solitaire.

Excellent variety of abilities in the different cards; they offer great thematic and mechanical variety. Interesting to have the "town" that you interact with. Gameplay is, for the most part, very intuitive. Downsides are that there's not a lot of actual deckbuilding, the art on the monsters is too dark for the small size, and some mechanics are wonky. Despite those, it's a lot of fun to play. Any co-op fan who likes deckbuilding should check it out.

This is the most thematic deckbuilder I've ever played.  I love how the town deck and villagers work to make a thematic experience that lacks from other deckbuilders like Dominion, Thunderstone, and Legendary.  

The rulebook is a disaster, but Rahdo's video and BGG did a great job teaching the rules so I never have to even look at the rulebook.  

I do wish there were more hero cards, because I can see that getting dry quickly.  But, I love how the monster decks play so differently and that helps with replayability.

I do have some mechanical complaints.  This game does seem to kind of lack the usual ramp-up and climax of other coop games.  The loss condition of having no villagers in town is thematic, but creates a weird loss condition that can be come out of nowhere and be very luck dependent.  The winning condition is also a little wonky because there is no final battle.  Getting a wall victory means you are just fending off monsters and trying to build up your economic engine with heroism.  Getting a seal victory can feel pretty arbitrary as well.

I'm worried that the game will be too easy and slow with 2 players.  I think it would be great with 4, but haven't had an opportunity to try that yet.  Initial rating is 7.5, but I could easily see it go up to 8.5 or down to 6.

UPDATE: After a few more plays, my rating has gone down.  The game really does not scale well and now in 2017 there are more options for fantasy-themed cooperative deckbuilders that fill the niche previously occupied by Shadowrift.  Primarily Harry Potter: Hogwarts Battle and Aeon's End.  While I do really like the town deck mechanism in Shadowrift, the rest of the mechanisms feel clunky or dated.

RATING: 7
A solid cooperative deck-building game that plays fairly quickly once players grok the flow. Still, it seems players figure out pretty quickly whether they are making good progress or things are spiraling out of control, which lessens the tension a bit. The theme/flavor of the game is just OK ... everything is functional but the art is just OK and the experience is hardly immersive. In a nutshell, Shadowrift is good but not great.

Reviews touted it one of the ultimate coop deckbuilders, so it triggered two buzzwords with me right away and I had to get it. Not totally sure about this one, it has lots of thematic stuff going for it and I like the design and flow, but will need to play it more often to see if it holds up to compareable games like Runeage or Shadowrun: Crossfire or even the oldie Thunderstone Advance. In the end I picked SR:CF and Thunderstone more often than this, so I traded it.

Played Kickstarter edition once and didn't want a second play.

ShadowRift was touted as a cooperative fantasy deckbuilder. As I love deckbuilders and cooperative games, kickstarting the second edition was an easy choice.

We played one game over several days while my husband was on paternity leave. I found it, not bad exactly, but aggressively mediocre. The recommended cards for a first play was somewhat boring with lots of simple attacks and no obvious combos. Improving my deck was slow and there were no deck thinners. The game seemed to outstay its welcome, had no obvious 'ramp up', and finished somewhat anticlimatically - either when we'd sealed the second shadowrift or built the last wall. The Archfiends expansion, which we didn't use, adds a boss battle at the end, but this apparently lengthens the game further.

We subsequently played the new Arkham Horror LCG (once) and it was a much more entertaining experience. We have better games. I couldn't see Shadowrift improving with repeat plays as deckbuilders always have slow ramp-up. The game also seemed to lack interesting decisions and involved doing the same thing over-and-over. Onto the sale pile...

Cooperative, Dominion-like deck builder with unique elements. Buy loot or spells or get help from good villagers. Its a race to seal the gates or build walls to shutoff the flow of rampaging egg-laying, nasty archfiends and lava swimmers. We lose if we run out of villagers.

One of the first cooperative deck-builders! A bit fiddly but if each person playing takes a duty in the monster/village prep stage that issue is mitigated. Need to play more as the satisfaction of sealing the gates through the power of teamwork satisfies an itch that I have for a good high-fiving cooperative experience.

I don't think it's possible to figure out how to play this game for the first time using only the rulebook.   Youtube videos helped.  The rulebook makes sense now that I know how to play, but it's missing a lot of clarifying information that you expect in rulebooks.  We figured out how to play it after some bumps and mistakes.  I might even be playing it correctly now.  Maybe.

It seems fun so far now that we (maybe) know what we are doing but the frustration level in getting things up and running is high.

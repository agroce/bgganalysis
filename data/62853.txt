The only reason I didn't rate this as ONE is for the theme and the original idea. I really liked the idea of realtime boxing but the execution fails miserably.

First of all, the rules are way too complicated for a 15min game. 

Two, the rules are badly written. 

Three, boxing is a tactical sport. In the rink, you do not just flail your hands around madly. In Jab you can just throw cards at the opponent and end the round in 5 seconds. If your opponent stopped to think about countering, clinching or what ever combos that might allow him to reach health tokens from you, you've won for certain.

Four, all the cards have too similar visual appearance for the game to be playable in the way it was meant to. You cannot tell the difference between two cards at one swift glance which would be crucial for making combos and counter moves.

Broken.

+ Great match between the mechanics and theme.
- The skill difference between practiced players and new players is too much to overcome.


Why it's previously owned:
Not everyone enjoys games based on speed, and this one is particularly unfriendly to those that are just learning the game.  A game that scares off new people is certainly difficult to justify keeping around.  This was a part of the trade for Dragon Valley.

I am really glad I decided to buy this game.  After every play I feel as if there is a lot of room for improvement.  For the short play time the intensity can't be beat.  I'm starting to think that changing up my play style after each round would be wise.  If my opponent has a fixed play style, fast/slow, counters/haymakers then there is a good response, but a chameleon is much harder to pin down.

Subtleties abound in this unique filler. The more you play, the more coordinated you get, which means that an experienced player will beat a newbie every time. Play is fast and furious (some might say too much so), although there is a Ding card (the "I choose to end the round card") which carries a penalty for a super-fast player. Repeated play should create a mind/body fusion of sorts, but a game is over too quickly and I got bored with the whole thing.

Not sure how much replayability it will have (probably on the order of 10 - 15 games) but the first play was fun.  It's not at all deep, but trying to manage all the different things going on in real time is tough.  I won 3 rounds to 2 but was close to be KO'd through a lot of the game.  Definitely a fun 2-player game and I wonder how well it would play with more than 2 if you had more than 1 set.

This game will probably stay ranked as a 7 but I hope to see it receive a fair amount of play as a light, fun game.

Listen carefully and you can hear the theme.... "Dum da daaaaa -- dum daa daaaaaahhhhh.. dum da dum da dum-dee-dum-dum.. dum da dum da dumdumdumdum daaa-daaaaa!!"

ROCKY 4 MEETS Mike Tyson's Punch Out.   This is an innovative speed game that combines elements of nertz, hali gali, and other such games to make for an interesting 2 player experience.
 
It has a bunch of rules that sound pretty straightforward, but when you're playing quickly in real time it's very easy to forget what you're supposed to be doing.   That makes for a pretty chaotic and bumpy first game.   I think that once both players are well familiar with the rules though this could become a frantic game requiring quick decisions.    So, we'll rate it a 7 for now.

July 2011:  RATING CHANGE!  Yes!  After more plays I like it even more.  There is a give-and-take that changes as your health does.  You turn from worrying about points, to worrying about health, and then back again.   The TKO vs KO distinction is well done.

Rating it an 8.    Word of warning though:  this game involves lots of slapping down and bending of cards.   Cards WILL get destroyed playing this game because, well, you're boxing.     

Just a warning for the OCD types who freak out and can't sleep properly when a card in one of your games gets bent.  You can always buy a second copy to keep unbent.

I played this one at Fallcon 2009.  The designer was there and he was promoting this game he designed.

The game is real-time because both players play simultaneously, which I think is a real problem with the game.  Basically, the player that can draw and play his cards the fastest will win the game every time, little strategy required.

I'm not really huge on speed/reaction games, but this one overall is pretty doable since it's less about pure speed, and more about seeing patterns to react to.

The difficulty here is actually pretty high, as there are several patterns to be watching for at all times, and the game state is constantly changing since cards get played pretty frantically.

Overall, it's a pretty cool take on the theme and is well implemented.  I just don't know who the heck I'd play it with, as most non-gamers I know would be overwhelmed by it, and I don't do any two-player sessions with gamers really.

If I were rating this purely from a what do I think if the design perspective, I would rate this at least a nine, maybe a ten. It is pure brilliance and so far removed from anything else out there that I don't see how he made the mental leap in order to design the thing.

Now, I'm no boxer, but this game gives me the impression that, minus the pain of getting repeatedly punched in the face, I now know what it means to step into the ring.

I love how you play the cards singlehandedly from your two decks, one card at a time, giving you the impression that you are swinging punches at the other boxer. I love how you need to pay attention to offence and defence. I love how hearing counterpunch, combo, combo, stagger, all in short order, makes you, the player, stagger , confused, as you look at the piles to witness it, giving the opponent the opportunity to continue to lay into you. You are, in essence, punch drunk.

Mechanically, this is the only speed pattern matching game I know if where there is so much going on. Where you can block and with what cards, haymakers, combos, counterpunches, those six stacks form many different patterns and being successful requires a passing glance at all of them as well as your life total.

Speaking of life totals, there are two ways to win at this game, you can go for combos, or you can go for the knockout, and a player who ignores their life total may be in for a shock when they hit the mat.

However, the game rewards a combination of experience and talent that makes it difficult to introduce new players. A first time player against someone who has played even three games is at a huge disadvantage, and unless they have a lot of talent for these types of games (speed pattern matching games), I can't see them even being competitive. It's hard to want to play a second game when you don't even feel competitive in the first.

This is what keeps me from getting the game to the table. If I knew someone who was really into it, this would be a keeper, because it really is genius design, but as it is it remains a game that I would suggest that everyone who can play it (there is a physical element that could prevent some), try it. If only to see proof of how much game design space there is still untapped, and to see a beautiful pairing of mechanics and theme, and in the hope that they are a match for it, because if they are, this is the type of game you could play for years and keep getting better.

This is an awesome simulation. The rules are simple, but it takes a while to get your head around all of the options. I'm not sure that a power strategy, ie going for the knockout, can work. You really need to be a technical fighter. Blocking and going for combos is key. I think it should also be played with a timer.

Rated 8 after two quick back-to-back plays with a good buddy. If I try to think of games that are most unique in my collection, I think of Space Alert, Galxy Trucker... maybe Dominant Species... I dunno. It's really hard to find a unique game when there's been such an explosion of options.

Jab is unique. It's not a pure speed card game; it really is a back and forth of card play between two people, and I'll be damned, it kinda feels like boxing.

Of course, with two plays, we bumbled through the different types of punches, but already this strikes me as a lot of fun. One mild concern I have is that an experienced person will likely crush a newbie. That might be balanced out by disproportionate health at the start, but it could still be an issue. 

I need to try this with my wife. If she likes this, it could be pure solid gold. 

Update: Traded away in a math trade along with 10 Days in Africa and Ubongo Duel for Bootleggers. Well, the wife didn't like it. So much for pure solid gold! The shame of it is that I think this is a very solid design that accomplishes exactly what it intends. The only problem is that it is a two-player-only game, and I'm either gaming with my wife or gaming in a group. I just didn't see this getting much play.

RATING: 7
The real time mechanic lends itself to a lot of fun options.  We held several "boxing tournaments" and each fight played out differently.  Some players went all in on offense and big combos (but found themselves exhausted early), other matches fighters played the counter puncher sitting back waiting to counter and land their own big blow, and some of the very best matches were much more methodical and not chaotic at all with each player timing every strike against a tactically sound defense blocking each shot.  You need to be on your A-game when it comes to fast thinking and speed processing.  It can get a bit TOO messy and chaotic at times when the action ramps up though and be prepared for these cards and possibly some knuckles to take some damage.

I've playtested Jab in its prototype format. Jab is a great way to get an adrenaline rush in a short game.

One day I hope to play this enough to be able to get to the sweet science. In the first few games merely slapping down your cards as quickly as possible seems to be a winning strategy, which is unfortunate, since this style of play would more aptly be called, "JAB: Realtime Hissyfit".

Players represent boxers, trying to win by either knocking out their opponent, or scoring a points decision over several rounds.  Clever, real time game where players are playing punch cards from their left and right hand decks (fists) onto their opponent's head or body stacks.  Punches will accumulate points, while punches in certain combinations ramp up the points.  Punches can be blocked by colour/punch matching, filtering out the high scoring punches at the end of the round.  Boxers can also be hurt via counter punching, or by staggering your opponent (a haymaker punch, followed up by a matching colour) - and hurt your opponent enough and you may get a knockout.  Fun game, initially bewildering as you try to follow the action in real time - there are literally about six things to track, which is almost impossible to do effectively.  Wonderfully themed, and felt a bit like a ramped up Toppo.  Worth a look.

It's a live action game in that you both are playing cards simultaneously trying to create combos before your opponent does the same to you.

Cute concept, nice design. The game is really fun at first because of the real time aspect. However, the novelty wears off pretty soon, and what remains is anything but meaty. In fact, none of my plays ever went far beyond the first round. Everybody I showed it to seemed quite pleased by the real time aspect, but not taken in enough by the game play to finish even a single play. The gimmick seems to wear off after two rounds max. 

Still, I think it is an easy, short and crisp party game for two people (plus audience) whose mechanics mimic the theme. It might even be cool to play a championship with more players. Might be nice as a filler.

So many cards you need to pay attention to as the piles constantly change. Does give a feel of some kind of boxing though, blocking punches, focussing your own, looking for combos etc. Great fun but my wife has decided that she'll probably never be as good as me at it which means that bouts tend to be a little one-sided.

received as door prize @ bgg.con.  Finally played it.  Ehhhh... beyond being a 2-player only game (which is a big negative for me) it seems too complex for what it is - a "Speed" variant.  It seemed very clever until we actually started playing.  Then, it just wasn't that fun at all, and I think I would rather just play speed in the future during the rare times i want to play a combative 2 player real time card game.

I would always avoid the Ding! tile in this game. It's thematically broken and makes no sense. If you use all your cards before your opponent does you gas out and take the punches for the rest of the round, that's what it means to me. You should play at least a couple of games without the combo and counter cards untill you, more or less, understand how to play the game. Once you can handle all the stuff it is a lot of fun!! And the theme makes a lot of sense!! As in real life boxing you will find different kinds of boxers, some just have a lot of knockout power and will put you to sleep if you don't defend properly. Others just mind the combos and defend a little and win every round by a lot of points. I've seen many different fights, most of them exciting and we even do match-ups when two fighters are similar. My brother, for instance, can knock you out in one round pretty easily and we all want to see him fighting the most skilled fighters.

Tons of fun.  Best between two players of equal skill, as an experience player will generally crush a newcomer.  This game also requires you to be in the mood for it, so not something you're necessarily going to want to play every day.  

But it's quick, tense, highly competitive, gets the adrenaline going.  A couple of successful haymakers really makes you panic.

A great fun game like Blink but much more to think about and of course a great theme which REALLY comes out well.  Yes if one player is weaker they will have a tough time, there are many ways to handicap the stronger player however. Have played twice so far and we are playing VERY slow, lots to track if you want the points, will take practice to get better, imagine that! Of course you can play fast neglecting points to try and win that way too, depends on what your opponent is doing. 

I don't see the strategy here per se, just lots to track which is tough especially if things are moving fast, you kind of have to play to the cards as they come up, though you can try to hold some back if opponent is not watching. Definitely some Novelty feel here, but I think we'll still want to play months from now just because it is very quick to setup and also play so suitable for weeknight, also you'll want to challenge your Brother, other friends, etc though at some point if you wait too long to do that they won't stand a chance....Luck of the draw is there but I think your skill at tracking info and overall co-ordination is more important, its also mostly for fun IMO but can certainly be played competitively . Very well written rules and very well thought out, good job Artisans and good price point & nice THICK cards nice job MM.   

========

Sounds really Novel and really FUN, like a more thinky version of "Speed" (Blink) which I also like. Should be nice tension here, probably a must have for me, have not read rules yet to see how much luck affects an outcome.

Fun real time game. You need to be quick playing and recognizing cards and I like that a lot. Also I (somewhat) like the theme and it fits perfectly with the game mechanisms. As the game is very fast in nature, it is very easy to cheat (intentional or unintentionally) and you will crush less experienced gamers (not necessarily a bad thing). Still it has lots of uncontrollable luck but as it plays so fast I don’t mind. 

My Jab games felt samey so I think it has limited replayability thus it is a good game to play from time to time. I want to play it soon gain to review my opinion of the game.

I played it another couple of times and all my previous opinions are still valid.

This time I read the game manual and it makes the game to look complex, but in reality it is very simple. You can explain it under 6 minutes.

JAB: Realtime Boxing is an unique game, but I have decided to sell it. The reason is that I’m culling my game collection of the ok to good games in order to play the best games. It pains me a bit selling it, but I already made my mind

Extremely well designed -- and as they claim, a game unlike anything you've played before.  There are a number of strategies to utilize and they all seem equally balanced in my experience.  The quick game play allows for multiple fights to be had...over and over and over.  Well done!  For $13, grab a couple of these...you never know when you might need to host a fight night tournament.

Fast, Furious, Fun.

Should I throw a jab?  At his head or his body?  NO, wait, maybe I should counter with it instead... no, I'll go for the comb-- oof!  A Haymaker right in the kisser!

This light, super quick filler game is great for 2 player fun with some slight dexterity in the mix.  

If anyone has ever played the card game I only know as "Spit,"
then you know what you're in for.... only the boxing theme suits the gameplay perfectly, making this game more fun than Spit ever was, in my opinion.  

In Jab, you must be quick on the draw, but also smart in your placement.  It's all about speed with intent!  I love how fast this game moves compared to most other games that require you to think about what you're going to do.  It plays simultaneously, which is cool, and the game itself looks vibrant.  My only small gripe here is that the cards will ware out quickly due tothe nature of the gameplay, but i don't really think sleeving the cards is a good option either...  no solution here expect to buy another copy once yours wares out enough... at least its cheap!  You can't really go wrong with this one if you desire a game that is going to deliver the three F's.

In my demo, I was quite confused.  There are a significant number of moving parts in this game, and I think it will take a while to figure them out.  Definitely not a "2 minute explanation" game, which is unfortunate for a speed game.  I want to like it, though.  We'll see.

Really fun.  Indeed it is realtime, and there's more going on than you can possibly keep track of simultaneously.  So your strategy is important, and keeping track of your opponent's is as well.  This is a much sharper design than you'd think.  Give it a look.

I don't care for boxing at all.  In fact, I really dislike boxing and all types of hand to hand combat.

However, JAB stands out as a very unique game that integrates a little bit of tactics into what is essentially a speed game.  I enjoy speed games of all types, so this is an extremely welcome development.

Once you start playing it is interesting how tricky the game play actually is.  It is near impossible to focus on everything at once and something is bound to escape your attention.  It seems that there are a lot of options as far as how to play and where to focus.

The only negative is very minor - it seems to me that we are starting to enter an age when small publishers are so conscious and connected to the BGG community that their presence actually becomes a little invasive, preventing or stifling discussion or critique of their games.  While I appreciate the availability of the game designer, publisher and others involved, I feel like it's starting to become a little too much.

When I can find someone else who appreciates it, I really enjoy this quick filler.

I very much enjoy real-time games. Jab! is no exception. It plays quickly (each round is just a few minutes), but balances thought with speed. You can play slowly, within reason, and defeat an opponent who just plays quickly. There's enough to think and worry about that you can only focus on so much at once.

RATING: 7
Game in a Nutshell: Speed-style boxing card game of sending blows, throwing down combos, blocking and counter-punches to be the first to win three rounds or get a knock-out.

Played as: 2 player game only

Pros: One of the most thematic games I've ever played. It really feels like I've gone a few rounds in the ring by the time the game's over. It's amazing to me that with so many things to recognize and react to, the game basically requires you to focus, thus developing a "style" similar to real boxers; brawler, defensive, big hitter, sly tactician, etc. It's fun for me to see those styles go toe to toe and make the adjustments necessary in order to have the upper edge.

Cons: "Boxing" is not the most relaxing theme to get absorbed into. Not only does it get my heart-rate up and the adrenaline flowing, but it can actually feel demoralizing to lose by knockout. That makes it a tough game to want to play at any given time, and one I would hesitate to recommend to others.

Other: In my gaming circles through life, it seems that 'speed' style games have always had a certain draw to females (whom usually excel at them). I haven't played with a lot of females, but this game might be the exception... it's more of a "guys" speed game.

Best Use: For solving sibling rivalries in a more civilized manor.

It's a "simple" game, yet there's a lot going on. A heck of a lot, to be honest: You have to track, in real time, several different victory point paths, both offensive and defensive.

A really fabulous game design. Reminds me a little bit of [i]Brawl[/i], but with a better theme and a lot more to think about. Kind of overwhelming at first: tracking six piles of cards for punches/blocked punches, eyeing combos and counter-punches, trying to land devastating haymakers, all in turnless real time! Great, great stuff.

Having the health tokens double as round-winner tokens was an ingenious idea. The double-edged possibility of ending a round early with the Ding! token adds an interesting dimension to the game. My younger, more agile and quicker witted opponent continue to trounce me, twice by knockout (I've only managed to win a round or two), but I still love it and hope to play many more times. [4 plays]

So much going on here.  Another realtimer (like Icehouse) that is almost more sport than boardgame.  

The learning curve is appropriate, with skill in the game clearly learned, and the ability for different styles to emerge amongst different players.  

For example, despite trying to compete for style points, I don't think I've ever won a round on points, so had to switch to power and have acheived a couple of knockouts!

I hope I can bring the other gamers I play with along for the ride, because playing Jab regularly promises to be very rewarding.

The rules seem needlessly complicated for such a quick game, and the random ordering of the punch cards must make it hard to plan any tactics.  The game is likely to be won by a player who is quick at thinking and reacting.  I'm not, so I'm never going to do well at this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I generally do not like games where I have react quickly, I am not very quick.  This game not only does this, but it makes it quite confusing with all of the different piles of cards you have to watch, which is 7, plus, you have to watch your hand as well.  Too much for me, no thanks.

Probably about as close as you can get to a boxing game in a card game. I like it and will keep it in my collection, because it is so different than any other game I have. There are not many "speed" games in this hobby and this is one I can pull out with my wife and probably my daughters in a few years too.

RATING: 6.75
It's a card game where you draw from 2 decks and place them in "real time" in 6 spots. It's a very simple game with a smart design, about pattern awareness and quickness of reaction. It's an abstract core game, but the theme is well implemented.

It is played in 5 rounds; they are very brief and intense, but they feel repetitive, because you basically do the same. The accounting and setup time take at least twice the time you devote to play it. It should last 1 or 3 rounds maximum, but then the KO mechanism would not work as well.

RATING: 5.5
Perhaps just a little too tactical and scoring-heavy for its own good (although it can't be denied that the 'select one pile of three' scoring method is spot-on), JAB ultimately lacks the fun and loudness of 7-card Slugfest.

Having said this, if you can find a fellow gamer prepared to take it every bit as seriously, it might just be the greatest 2P game ever invented. A really brave effort at producing something altogether different.

Couldn't even finish one game cos wife really doesn't like the real-timeness of the game.

Excellent 2-Player Dexterity Boxing-Themed Card Game in Real Time. Jab packs quite a punch with brevity and strategy, without too much complexity.

Warning: Playing Jab may result in loud random shrieks, racing heartbeets, boisterous laughter, and sometimes blood from handslaps.

The learning curve wasn't too bad; best thing is to take your time and forget about winning until you can find your playing style. My main hurdle was the boxing jargon.

We sleeved this one.

A clever game and you can take real-time quite literally, you actually simulate the punches, blocks, haymakers but slamming the cards down on your opponents various body parts (represented by cards of course). An unusual filler, makes up what it lacks in depth with novelty for sure.

Playtester. JAB is a very unique 2-player head-to-head boxing game where you throw punches in real-time by playing cards to your opponent's body piles with your left and right hands. It's loud, it's raucous, it's intense, and it's surprisingly strategic. Do you sit back and wait for your opponent to set you up for a big haymaker? Do you go on the offensive and just try to land as many blows as you can? Do you play defensively and secure the counterpunches? Do you try to set yourself up for the combos? Do you clinch in an effort to regain some much-needed health? Every time your opponent changes strategy, you've got to adapt.

The art's gorgeous, too. This game's got 4 thumbs up from me.

I didn't think I would like this game because I don't like being put in a position to make quick decision. After a few plays and starting to get familiar with the rule. I started enjoying it quite a bit, same for my son. Even though he lost quite a lot but he keeps wanting to try.

This is actually a very smart game and it is actually not as fast as some people thinking. There are a lot to consider during the game instead of blindly putting cards everywhere. 

I think the term "real-time" turns away many people but I think people should give it a shot. You will get familiar with the rules after a couple of plays and the fun will start. I think it is a great filler.

Fun, quick, refreshing game! The designer put a few systems in place to make sure that playing a more paced and strategic game can be competitive, so its not all speed -- but at the same time, it's still fast paced, frantic, and fun, because the person who plays optimally faster will win. Kinda like Galaxy Trucker, where there's a lot to pay attention to and think about, but definitely rewards quicker play.

I'm not really a fan of dexterity/speed games overall, and the rules are a little messy -- but I can't think of a better way to translate boxing into a card game. Unique.

I feel kind of bad giving this a 5.5.  It is actually successful design, but one that I just didn't get any enjoyment from.  I thought it was very clever, and I'm sure that two players that are into quick play real time sports games are going to love this.  

In general I'm not a huge fan of games that are strictly set collection and while there certainly is a pattern recognition thing going on as well ultimately is all you are doing is matching.  You try to match cards for blocks, match cards for combos, match colors for haymakers, match colors for counter punches, etc.  It's like Set meets Contract Rummy with a fully integrated theme.  If I liked either of those two games or were into the theme in any way I suspect I'd enjoy this.

Two-player competitive speed-pattern analysis.  This game is basically speed with a boxing theme, but I like the little ways how the theme is implemented in this game (example: using your left and right hands to play left and right punch cards respectively).  Some of the patterns are a bit counterintuitive and there's a lot to keep track of, but this might be a feature rather than a flaw.  I think I like this game more than a 6, but I'm not sure.

Real time game where you have to make decisions. In opposite to Brawl both players have the same deck. You don`t need to learn the deck, you must lern the game. You could try to play in the same way. You have 2 different victory conditions (by points or by knockdown). Strong theme. Fast. 

Overall nice alternative to Brawl. Both are real time games where you fight, but there are completly different games.

Actually this one's a pretty neat boxing simulation radiating all the flavor from a heavyweight brawl. Waiting for the right moment vs. an all-out offense, tactical boxing and aiming for round wins vs. pursuing a knockout victory.

Jab is a game that is designed to overwhelm you.  You're playing cards from two decks, your left hand and right, to three piles on your opponent.  You're trying to pay attention to the combo cards, so that if you've got the specified combination played on your opponent you can claim a combo card.  You're also trying to pay attention so that you can play a haymaker punch and then follow it up by playing any other punch matching the same color on top of it.  And you're paying attention so that if you have any two cards played on your opponent of the same color as the counter punch, you can claim the counter punch.  And of course, you're trying to pay attention if the opponent is threatening to do any of those things to you... if he is then you can "block" the punch by playing a matching punch, or in the case of a haymaker by playing any punch.  And at the end of the round, you should know which two piles you've played the most high number cards to.  And you're trying to do all this in a speed competition. Needless to say, you're going to lose track of something.  Or more likely lose track of everything.

It's a quick game.  There's some strategy going on, but it's a little undercut by the real-time speed competition.  It's not a bad game, and if you devote some time to getting good at it, it'd probably be a lot of fun.

I don't like real-time games, but was hoping this one would be different. There definitely is more going on here, and I'd even go as far as to call it an excellent simulation of boxing - but as a game, I didn't find it to be particularly fun.

The biggest problem I encountered was an unfortunate combination of randomness and perfect information of the current game state. During one round, I just could not draw the cards I needed, and it made me wonder how significant the card order is relative to player skill.

The ending of another round is perhaps more instructive. My opponent and I were each down to 4 cards - one in each hand, and the last one in each pile. Those cards were all perfect counters for each other, and since blocking is more powerful than attacking, the "best move" for each of us was to wait for the other to go. So we did. And then waited some more. Eventually I decided to just go as fast as I could and take the Ding in the hopes that my opponent would be caught off guard - and it made a mess of the table.

Real time is the domain of video games for a reason, and while this is a valiant effort, unless you're vehemently opposed to video games, there's no reason to play this over any number of boxing video games.

Wow! This game is incredible. The game requires quick-thinking and quick-reaction time, so it may not be for everyone. The design is rock-solid and innovative, and may be the finest pairing of theme and mechanisms I've encountered.

I like the game, too bad my wife hates it and she is the one I play most two-player games with.

A real-time game that has plenty of strategy. Being quick is important, but skilled play will definitely win out over pure speed.

No need to read the rules if the opponent knows how to play. The numerous VC options are a useful design lesson. Yet again a game uses basic stuff in a new way: a -1 modifier becomes more fateful when it applies to one die, and less so applied to one die of two or more. Clever, and there are other similar features often involving player choice. And its quick to play. There are a few rules problems, maybe cause by losses in translation, and layout could have been better ["Supply" is hard to find].  Nice physical production, and you need Yu-Gi-Oh-size deck protectors for the cards [see Miscellaneous Card Game Accessory], plus a countertray, all of which fits in the box. And it costs less than usual. Credible game of the year nominee.

and so i gave it an "8". The major problem is that its a one-and-a-half player game, where the butler or family dog can happily play the Republicans whilst you mow the lawn.

Wargame with very easy and simple mechanics. Can be played with a beguinner in the hobby or no-wargamer in 2:30-3:30 hours.
Both players must alocate their human and material resources. The Nationalist must attack and the republican need to defend to the last with good opportunities to strike back.
The cards are used to managed the reinforcements and the resources OR to spend in battle for DRMs.
Tough decisions for both sides.

In my opinion simulates well the conflict of Spanish civil war in friendly and easily way.

Playing time: around 3-4 hours

Only played through once while learning the rules.
Made a couple of mistakes (as you do), but this game is very enjoyable and strategic. Unfortunately like every war game since the dawn of time is heavy with dice based combat, but the cards are very useful and is very historically accurate.
Warning, this game is very long! not for the faint of heart.

RATING: 6
A well produced game, bulging with historical flavour.  I like the counter and card artwork.  The map, by contrast, looks rather plain, though it's entirely functional.  

While the rules are straightforward, there are clever systems to limit the number of battles (attacks must be led by a general) and to simulate the impact of tanks and aircraft.  

The combat system presents the players with some interesting decisions about what to deploy and when.  It also faithfully represents the attritional nature of battles in this war. However, it does feel rather long-winded.

I think that tactically there is quite a lot of variation in the game, but I do wonder whether there are real strategic decisions.  A strategy of defense in depth with few attacks seems the only one open to the Republican.  The Nationalist at least has some options for the main thrust of his attack.  Still, this is quite a fun game.

This is a great game that requires a good combination of tactical and strategic planning, and it is always hard to guess what your opponent will do next.  Espana 1936 is played on a knife edge, and requires tough decisions to be made throughout the game.  Only the play time will keep this one from hitting the table very often.  Wasitfun: Yes.

Milsims special 3/09. Interested in giving this a go. The Europa game 'For whom the bell tolls' is about 50 times longer playing time.

Played 30/9/09. Very quick playing and a range of tough decisions. Kind of a 'Paths of Glory' lite game. The vibes are good and further sessions planned. Rating based on initial playthru.

Despite being crushed into submission by the fascist horde by turn 5 of my second game, it still seems like a fun way to pass the time and learn about the era. Resisted the urge to send the bombers to Guernica...

RATING: 8
Tentative rating based upon first play.  Rating will probably go up.  

Beautiful components depicting the various factions involved in the conflict.  Interesting but simple rules and game mechanics that make an innovative system different from many other wargames.  Simple enough that there will be crossover appeal for people not used to wargames, and easy enough that it can be explained without having to read through the rules. Rulebook is simple that it might be a euro rather than a wargame.  If you aren't careful, you are going to accidently learn some history here.

There are clarifications and Faq's posted here.  

The first play left me looking forward to playing this again.  Looks like a game that I will have to pick up.

What a brilliant game this is. I reckon 3 to 4 hours to play, simple rules (very well translated), with the accent on lots of strategic problems and opportunities. Attacks are limited by the number of generals; which gives a good historical level of activity. Aircraft and tanks neatly rolled into the game (with lovely counters). Cards used for events only. Easy sequence means the Nationalists move first (so can grasp opportunities) and the Republicans second (so they can shore up the front).

I hope it is available outside Spain because it as good as anything Martin Wallace does (and that's high praise from me) and just as accessible.

It looks a million dollars.

Nice production values and interesting topic (made all the more interesting by watching Pan's Labyrinth). Not sure about the balance yet. In my one game there was no see-sawing at all. The Fascists started with greater numbers, gained a greater number of reinforcements and never lost a battle. Others claim this is finely balanced so I probably had some very bad luck or am a rubbish general.

No soy muy amante de los wargames pero la verdad este que lo he jugado dos veces me parece bastante divertido. Instrucciones bien escritas, me encantan los componentes y me gustan mucho las cartas, me parece que los eventos que reflejan están muy bien traídos. El único pero que le veo es que hay demasiado azar para resolver batallas y que jugar con el Republicano es difícil y tienes que aceptar un papel defensivo cosa que a veces no es fácil de asumir. En general muy buen juego para iniciarte en el lado oscuro.

1. Design - solid euro-style components, beautiful counters, easy to read cards, solid board. A+
2. Mechanics - core of the game is in control of areas - they determine supply, movement and combat possibilities. Rules are OK, but some clarifications was needed. FAQ is very useful, especially in naval matters.
3. Play - lots of fun, tension and climax. Balance is achieved when we play with naval rules. Without this, nationalists are in better position.

RATING: 7
Decent light wargame covering the Spanish Civil War. The rules are simple, the combat interesting, and the playing time short.

Regular play has exposed a few issues, namely that a few of the events are clearly more strategically significant than others, such as when General Mola is removed, War Academy is played, and so on. It's also possible that those cards are never played, along with large chunks of your air force & armor getting buried. This can tilt the game more heavily than I would like. I may have to play with the historical variant in the future.

Also, the rulebook is a bit aggravating, as it is written in a conversational style that I don't feel works well for wargames because it's hard to reference, and small but important rules end up in odd places.

I recommend playing without the naval rules since they increase playing time, and will require the FAQ by your side to muddle through.

RATING: 6
Simple wargame with two players taking on the Nationalists or Republicans during the Spanish Civil War.  Players alternate moving their units, then drop in air support and generals to indicate where the fighting will be this turn.  Combat is simple 5/6's hit, with generals, tanks, aircraft and cards adding die rolls and modifiers to the combat.  Events are played near the end of each turn to add some flavour into what is a fairly generic game.  Victory is assessed based on the number of objective cities controlled, although each side has auto-victory triggers.  Nice design, which has been very well developed.  Very nice components too - all in all, a great introductory wargame themed on a neglected wargaming subject.

Very well done game.  Attractive, fun, easy to play and reasonably accurate.  The game is demanding, if you are not careful you can waste a lot of resources without accomplishing much.  I have not played enough to know for sure, but it does seem that both players have multiple viable strategies.  I am looking forward to finding out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very impressed. Each side plays differently and must strike a delicate balance in their strategy. Lots of things that can be explored here and the "free" movement keeps the game dynamic and fluid. The combat is not as clean as it could be, and event cards can be a little swingy, but overall, it's a winner.

Update: On second thought, the replayability may not be as high as I thought. There are numerous tactical variations but the broad strategies are inherently fixed.

I played this game a couple of times, and found it to be interesting. Asymmetrical sides contribute alot to the play, and the subject matter is fascinating. This conflict is woefully neglected in the wargaming circles. Unfortunately, I ultimately ended up trading this one away. While full of novel and well thought out mechanisms, I didn't like all the potential modifiers to combat. There were simply too many things going on. I was yearning for a simpler experience, with a little bit less chaos. 

I like the idea that aircraft and tanks modify the combat totals, by supporting the efforts of infantry. Smashing idea!! Kudos to all for this one, just not my cup of tea. 

Eliminated in the great game purge of 05/30/2010.

More interesting than entertaining, a solid design but not especially compelling. Can be a bit of a grind. Some critical interactions (such as the relationship between contested and enemy boxes on movement) are kind of buried in the rules, while other important concepts are inferred rather than made explicit. In this the game is a bit like a Columbia design, which "reads simple" but plays with more complexity, leading to rules-flipping and head scratching as you try to confirm that, yes, the rules mean what they suggest. Add a point if you're attracted to the subject (which I am not, especially, glad to fill in a bit of knowledge about this era, though). Doubt I will play it again.

I was impressed with how fun this is and how everything works well. Very slick, a great gateway wargame, there is a euro feel to it, but not in a bad way.

Not a bad game, but feels like a game system with only one scenario. The spanish version first came out without naval rules, and then introduced them as an expansion. As I was used to play the game without naval rules, so I found them a bit cumbersome.

The artwork is a bit spartan, but this is actually good because it fits the theme.

RATING: 7
My one play of this was left me undecided. The setup was more laborious and time consuming than I prefer in my games. I think the fan-created setup aids are pretty much required and only mitigate it somewhat.

The actual gameplay was very fluid with few real rules lookups.

I liked the way the "card assisted play" worked in practice, it make for nice tense decisions with the usual paralysis of units that CDGs give.

I always have my doubts about fixed setup games. How much fun they'll be after 5 or 10 or 20 plays. Whether they become too scripted. I guess since I've only played this once in the almost two years I've owned it that's a silly and academic question.

In practice, the counters are a bit hard to tell apart. Some slightly better iconography would have been nice. This is especially painful during setup but comes up at other points as well.

After one play I can't yet say whether it was "interest enough" to warrant keeping. It sure is a nicely made game, though.

I own the English version.  The game is fun and plays quickly.  The rules are quite short and reasonably clear.   You can teach this game in 15 minutes.   The combat system is innovate and fun, but dicey.  It isn't a card driven game, but the cards are a critical.  The events on the cards are mostly reinforcements, so the trade off is usually reinforcements vs the ability to affect a battle.  This war had so much going on politically, I would like to have seen more of that in the card play.  Still, this is an approachable and fun game, playable in one sitting, and covering a very interesting conflict.

A brilliant design with enormous subtly to unusual elements like the counter mix (though it may seem uniform at first glance) and counter strength.  

The combat system somehow manages to make extended battles of attrition interesting and tense (there are definitely some WWI design elements to be stolen from this game).  

There are certain fiddly bits -- tracking movement and replacements on the board is a little helter skelter.  But, Mr. Catalan has finally provided the gaming world with a design worthy of this fascinating conflict.

One game only, in which I played as Nationalist. Borrows a lot of mechanisms from War at Sea/Victory in the Pacific but has a strong flavour of its own.

Asymmetrical wargame in which the Republican player is on the defensive and must be careful and patient, while the Nationalist player has the strategic initiative but the tougher victory conditions.

Easier to play as Nationalist for inexperienced players - I doubt Chris as the frustrated Republican will rate as highly!

I looked forward to playing this game for some 3 and when I finally got it to the table it turned out to a serious disappointment. [i]España 1936[/i] [i][b]isn't[/b][/i] a bad game as such: the components are nice; the systems are logical; playing the game is a real challenge. It's just that, well, it compares poorly to games like [thing=62227][i]Labyrinth[/i][/thing] or [thing=12333][i]Twilight Struggle[/i][/thing] (and no doubt other CDGs otherwise more similar to [i]España 1936[/i].

Why? Generally because it makes relatively poor use of the cards. First: the classic IGO-UGO play gives a lot of player downtime, as opposed to the more interactive CDG system of alternating cardplays. Second: the events- mostly to do with recruiting more units, are lacklustre compared to those of more classic CDGs: they don't give much colour and they generate little or no tension.

The rulebook is also not very good. It's no stinker for sure but it is poorly structured overall, and it lacks both an index and a detailed table of contents. It reminds me of FFG's rulebooks as FFG would like to think they are. 

There was a time when a game like [i]España 1936[/i] would've been notable for its strengths. Now those strengths just don't match up to the competition. I guess my Spanish Civil War game of choice is still to be found then. :shake:

This game is a lot of fun. The rules are a bit confusing, especially the naval ones (which IMHO is totally fun and definitely value added!).

I really like how the game handles the escalation of the war by letting you build larger and larger combat units. The card for reinforcements is also a great idea. The combat modifier aspect of the card is okay - I think maybe I used one or two during the course of the game, because who would use a combat modifier when the reinforcement is so much more critical?

You have to be a little careful as the Nationalist player, because if you commit EVERYTHING to the front line and the Republicans create a hole at the end of a turn, and have that offensive card and you dont have a reinforcement to plug the hole, um, it is all over (probably the only thing I dont like about the game is the fact that units move unlimited - which is okay except when combined with a hole in the line and no response capability).

Overall a great system that I can see being used for many a conflict where infantry was the dominant aspect of the fight and the 'combined arms' stuff was really secondary if at all.

Temporary rating, based on one play. So many rules are unclear and we got so many situations that where completely left out of the rules that we'll need to play again once they are clarified.  Advanced naval rules are a mess.  Not a huge fan of the combat resolution either.  The cards are very good.  Some are overpowered IMHO but the cards are the part of the game I liked the most.  Movement mechanic is unrealistic(you can move across the country if you have control of the right regions) but I must admit it adds to the tension alot.  I'll choose Path of Glory and Shifting Sands over this game anytime though, but I'm ready to give it another go when we find our answers to the rules questions and I'm confident the rating will go up at that time.

Very good game which captures the historical feel of the conflict without getting bogged down in too much chrome. Lots of decision-making as well as strategic and tactical options. Some aspects of the war perhaps over-simplified, but in the end allows a faster, more enjoyable game. Among the best and most interesting CDGs I've played recently.

A really fun grand strategy game on the Spanish Civil War that provides just enough uncertainty and tough choices through card play to keep things interesting.  I also enjoy the battle system, which is a refreshing and fun way to resolve the individual battles.  By making each battle involve a few deployment choices and a several die rolls, this system provides several interesting mini-game opportunities within the larger strategic game.

I haven't been able to sink my teeth into this one yet, and thanks to Juan and his rigged dice I got slaughtered in my playtest of this at GenCon. But it was absolutely fun none the less. I am not truly a wargamer, but because of the theme and the design of this one it definitely has some great appeal.

Juan, I want a rematch when I have actually had a chance to read through the rules!

RATING: 6.5
A wargame that is admirably streamlined in its ruleset but unfortunately has so little chrome that it seems to lack any of the historical specificity that leads people to play wargames in the first place.  The variety of units appears clever but the distinctions between the different troops are fairly trivial.  Similarly, the card decks would appear to offer some opportunity for historical flavor but they are mostly bland reinforcements and vary little between the factions.  The combat system also seems a little clunky and slow.  The most interesting aspect of the game is movement which offers some interesting mechanics and forces one to make tough decisions about how thin to spread one's lines in the pursuit of objectives.  Overall a decent game that could have been better.

RATING: 8
Strategic level point-to-pont simulation of the Spanish Civil War.  The graphics are very nice as to the usual Euroish colors and ease of play. Each card is really a piece of art by itself.  The complexity is low enough to make it an introductory wargame without sacrificing the game's value as a simulation...All factions are involved from Anarchists, Fascists, Communists, Monarchists, Arabs, Germans to Italians.  I would like to know if this game take into account of the Catholic church in the war too.  I would like to read Anthony Beevor's "Battle of Spain" after I play to know more about the history of it. 

The first struggle revolves around two ideological, though the two are not necessarily on the exact opposite, Nazis vs. Communists in the land of Spain that devastated the civilians and the whole country. When the war dusted, there were a total of 500,000 casualties.  

The war was slightly favouring the Nationalist in my view.  They have more men while most of the units are Communist and Anachist militia, with a -1 drm in combat up against the +1 drm Army of Africa units and regular Nationalist Army.

Like other Euros, the game seems to be simple in terms of the rules complexity but there in fact lies a lot of subtleties in the game. Movement and combat systems, while familiar among the Eurogamers, might not be so friendly to those wargamers accustomed to the traditional wargaming axioms. Combat units don't have movement factor. Theoratically they can fly like plane on the map as long as they don't enter a contested "Box", a city composed of 2 circles which house two sides' units; or an enemy-controlled box with enemy unit or control marker. Each side can only stack up to 4 troops, whereas generals,tanks and planes support units don't count. 

Combat can only take place when you have a general in the city. The Nationalists have more generals most of the time. Assignment of planes is conducted as part of the movement by moving them from the player's mat to any one city on the map. The planes are always removed from the map back to the mat at the end of the combat.  The assignment of planes to bomb the cities recalls my remote impression about this war, of that continuous bombing in many propaganda black-and-white film-noir.   

Espana 1936 contains card but it is not a Card-driven game ("CDG"). It is a Cards-assisted game (CAG, like the Four Lost Battles). They are used to influence the battle by either adding bonus dices or penalty dieroll modifiers. Since a score of hits require 5 or 6, they do give a lot of influences to the combat outcome. The use of a card removes it, i.e. they cannot be used later in the game. Practically, it means that you lose the event for winning a local battle, if you ever win one. Many units, especially the Republicans, are brought in by the card events during the Event phase (which takes place after the combat and upkeep phases). 

In combat, the no. of dices to attack or defend depends on the strength of the troop and the support units. For example, a troop with a 2-strength and a 1-strength plan get a total of 3 dices. The troops, generals, tanks and planes may have drm from -1 to +2. Combat takes place with individual troop attack, not combining the strength altogether. The attacker get to choose the defending troop each time. So depending on one's style and situation, you may choose to attack the higher strength troop for its importance, or you may choose to attack a weaker unit first to reduce the no. of troops your enemy has. A troop can only attack once but an enemy troop can be attacked more than one time, as long as it can survive the battle with steps remaining. Troop unit has four steps generally, with strength of 5-3-2-1.  There is a player aid card where you put your troops onto the 4 combat boxes, similar to the one used in GMT's Grand Illusion, although the concept of "reserve" is not applicable here.     

Replacement comes in every odd turn. Both sides calculate the no. of objective cities in control plus the no. of contested cities. This is the no. of replacement points. So losing an objective city cost you both the men and the replacement capability. It becomes especially costly to the side that is starting to loose the war. Each replacement point can either "reinforce" a unit on the map one step or bring in a new unit into any one friendly controlled city. To reinforce a unit on map, it is simply done so by flipping to its higher strength side or upgrading to the next higher step troop counter (i.e. from 2 to 3 strength troop). One replacemen point can bring in a new unit. The year of war determines the no. of troop strength that each replacement point can bring in or reinforce. Generally, as the war goes on, both sides can bring in more powerful troop and reinforce higer strength unit, e.g. replacement point can reinforce a 3-strength unit only starting from turn 7. Added with the above mentioned movement rules, it feels like playing "GO" somewhat when you place your units under the rule restrictions.

Overall, I quite like the game "light" approach to the battle.  This approach succeeds to simulate what would have been a complex "war" among so many factions and parties.  It can be completed in an afternoon (10 turns in total) quite easily between 2 experineced players.  However, I think the Nationalist player is favoured in the game and it would be a hard fought battle to turn once the Republican goes downhill.  The Republican stays on the defensive most of the time while the Nationalist has the initiative all the time.  Game balance might be an issue to some.  Of course, my view may change when I have more plays of the game. Perhaps I can really figure out the advantages that the Republican player can have.  Finally, I quite like the box cover art.  A work of art, reflecting the very Spanish cubic deep lined sculptured view of the world, Socialistic style.

I've always had a fascination with the Spanish Civil War, in part because it was such an overtly political/ideological conflict. 

This game beautifully captures the cat and mouse nature of the struggle, forcing you to carefully plan where you're going to place your planes and generals each turn. Then it kicks it up a notch with the events phase - although you can use your cards to help you in combat, the events are all so good that you want to conserve them as much as possible. It's, again, a lovely piece of design. Great game.

Strategic strightforward simulation of the spanish civil war. Interesting combat resolution system (each combat has several rounds using different units) that allow some kind of bluffing when it comes to decide the order of the rounds and the tanks and aircraft support. The event cards should be used always as event cards, but you have the option to use them in case of big needs during the combat. There are different victory conditions according the historical situation of each side. The art work is simple but nice. The game recreates the major events of the period but also give room for some "what if" events and allow players to try different options than the pure historical ones.

04/25/09 Played once, using the basic rules. I found the production values high (mounted board, well done rule book, nice art work on the counters, good play aids, etc.). I had never played a game concerning the Spanish Civil War yet had wanted to for a long time. But all the games I'd read about previously were poorly done and/or took forever to play. I enjoyed the game and look forward to playing it again.
11/20/10 Played again with basic rules. Both outings indicate to me the game is slightly biased towards the Nationalists, mainly due to them getting to move first each turn. Plus they have slightly better infantry. The Republican tanks & planes are better, but since they only come in via event card play you may or may not see them.

When I see it for the first time, i think it's a little boy's game, with its colours, and relatively simply counters and cards. But when I played it, i discovered a world of interaction. All the time I moved counters and/or played cards, maybe attacking or defending.
Historically some events are questionable, but a fun game at the end.

I want to try this one soon!

EDIT: Finally tried it and liked it a lot. Lessons learned in our first game:
-As republican, you really need to cover your back. I would say it's mandatory to leave units behind the frontlines in order to stop any national breakthrough. This is the way I mange to win in our first game on turn 3.
-Defenders can always manage to hold a place by just having one more unit than the attacker (it does not matter how good or bad they are)
-As National you really need to think what to do about Toledo. Should you defend it on the first turn or not? I didn't last time and I don't know how that would have turn out in the end...

Purchased this game on a whim in a ding and dents section of an online retailer.  Interested in this subject for some time, but had never purchased a game on the Spanish Civil War.  Wow, what a great surprise!  Found the game components to be very nice, rules laid out well and an interesting map.  A background of the SCW may be helpful to understand why the designer laid out the movement order the way he did.  Historically the Nationalist were forcing the Republicans to react to their offenses.  Therefore they move first and have the ability to tie up the Republican forces.  The Republicans can counter some moves if they keep a reserve.  The Republicans have the advantage with a stronger navy that can have a small impact in the game. Card play can impact the game and not all cards come into play so each game is different.  I found the game to be very balanced, and the combat system has its own little charms.  A real gem of a game.  Some of the Naval rules are a bit unclear, but I used the same interpretations for the ground or air rules and that fixed the question.

After 2 plays (without the naval rules) I must say that this is a truly splendid game on an largely overlooked subject.  Asymmetrical play and a variety of available strategies ensure that no two games are predictably the same.  I'll be interested to see what difference the naval rules make . . . 

Update: total 4 plays, last one with naval rules.  Still love the game but do not think the naval rules add anything to game play, especially when considering the rule overhead - I'll stick to play without the naval element in future games.

This is a fairly simple, partly card controlled wargame about the Spanish Civil War. For about 1/3 of the game we needed about 3.5 hours (which was much longer than what should be expected). The combat system is very simple: Each unit has strength points from 1 to 5, each point = 1d6. For example, 3 units, each with three power points -> 9d6, hit at 5 and 6, then apply optional or mandatory dice roll modifiers. Add some air and tank support, and finished. Even Axis & Allies, which was has been considered as the next step after Risk has a more sophisticated combat system. Hm. Well. Maybe not quite, but you get the idea.

The nationalists are significantly stronger than the Republicans, but the victory conditions are correspondingly asymmetrical. The movement rules are simple, but sometimes a bit unintuitive. Thus, a huge stack can be blocked by a single enemy unit for as long as it is there -> no big deal, just kind of thematically odd. The Air Force is based offboard (mechanically solved very easily). Supply rules are a bit strange as well: Two adjacent units always supply each other. Out of supply units do not suffer losses.

Overall, the feeling has something of a Columbia block game. Although there is no Fog of War (although apparently there is a variant in which the stacks remain stacked so as to create an element of uncertainty), but the d6-fighting system without Combat Result Table as well as the simple strength scoring system are very similar. Espana 1936 seems quite ordinary and common, but it has a strength that distinguishes it: It is exciting from the outset! I haven't been bored for a second, which may well be owed to the dynamic victory conditions. If I was a game designer, that would be an aspect that I'd examine with quite some interested.

The visual appear of Espana is a bit un-sexy, when for example compared with GMT (and their games are also no highlights graphic design art, if one looks beyond the wargame area), but still seems acceptable. Ingenious combat resolution board on which active, supporting and fatigued units are placed spatially separated. On the bad side, there's the game board irself. The small boxes are overflowing with counters, it would still loads of space in functionless gaps between.

Very enjoyable on the whole, about in the league with No Surrender!

Very easy to learn with lots of dice rolling, you can be fooled into thinking this as just a light beer & pretzels kind of game.  But in this game, looks are deceiving!  There's lot of tactical & strategic thinking neccessary; and good game play can turn around some very bad luck (and visa versa).

I love playing the historical variant with the naval rules.  You would think playing the cards in order would result in a more limited game, but what I love about this game, is that you can try different strategies and come about with different results.

"Today, with the Red Army captive and disarmed, our
victorious troops have achieved their final military objectives. The war is over." - Francisco Franco, April 1, 1939

Beautiful game with nice components.  To me it seems the Nationalists have a much easier time, while the Republicans can not afford to make mistakes and must hope and pray for the right cards to come up for them.  If the balance evens out with more plays I'll rate it higher, but even as it is, it is an enjoyable game that makes me keep wanting to see the Republicans eek out a victory under "normal" circumstances.

This is a great war game, and a very entertaining two player experience. The way the game is setup, there is always a ton of tension.

 les côtés positifs :  
* qualité du matériel et des graphismes
* le thème (pas si fréquent)
* la fluidité (prise en main facile, rapidité d'explication à un tiers, rapidité des parties...)
* je trouve ce jeu vraiment très sympa, il est à mon avis idéal pour lancer quelqu'un dans le "jeu d'histoire"
* chacune des phases est relativement simple (même si j'ai pour l'instant encore quelques imprécisions sur certains points )
* la diversité des conditions de victoire est intéressante
* le système de combat est amusant (certains reprocheront sans doute l'importance des résultats des dés)
* chaque joueur a de nombreuses décisions à prendre, mais le nombre limité de généraux fait que l'on doit bien choisir (on a envie de faire plein de choses... mais c'est impossible...) - les menaces sont nombreuses, les opportunités d'attaque également- C'est un peu frustrant mais assez réaliste je pense
* le choix de l'utilisation des cartes est également un dilemne intéressant (je les utilise pour mes renforts?, pour un malus au combat adverse? , un bonus pour mes propres troupes?, je les garde pour plus tard... )
* retournements de situations possibles (cartes, hasard...) : cela peut aussi être un défaut pour certains...
* pas mal d'options (dont les règles navales, pas testées ici mais qui doivent doubler encore l'intérêt du jeu)
* prix raisonnable...

 mais le jeu n'est pas exempt de défauts
 
* le fonds de carte (le seul reproche à faire en ce qui me concerne au niveau esthétique...)
* le nombre un peu trop réduit à mon goût de secteurs (ce qui limite un peu les choix de déplacements, d'attaque)
* uniformité cités objectifs (en terme de points de renfort, de valeurs de défense etc...)
* uniformité des coûts de déplacement d'un secteur à l'autre (j'aurais préféré un système légèrement plus fin (style Raid on St Nazaire...)
*... et surtout : le manque de scénarios (2 seulement)

... mais au total : un bon achat quand-même pour les joueurs qui veulent s'éloigner des "simulations prises de tête"

Devir makes good games. I can take or leave the art, but the game is a fun one which takes a little figuring out, mechanics-wise, but is fundamentally pretty simple and full of good ideas. We didn't try the naval game. 

It seems to play pretty historically. Although I played at a distinct disadvantage thanks to the cards (5 Nationalist generals vs my 2 Republican ones) and so could not choose many battles, I held out for a good while, although not long enough for World War II to start (not that that would have necessarily helped the Republicans anyway!).

Seems like a good game. Dug into Spanish Civil War games a while ago, and I kind of like the idea of having one. But this one has been picked up by Phalanx... hmmm!

Bought at Essen 2008

Edit: 16-01-2009, what a brilliant first play! So different from the two other CDG's I know (1960 and TS). There goes so much agony into deciding to play a card NOW for the Bonus or Penalty or hold it until the Events,. which comes waaayyy later. Holding it for the Event is somtimes so obvious, because it's a strong card, yet, since the game could be over by then... you're forced/doubtful to take it now for either B or P, since it could be the last thing you can do!

I'm proud to announce my '38 scenario win as the Republican player! It was a hard fought, lucky, but strategically sound offensive, with all the cards played and available at the right time and the right place. The Republic won with 7-5 cities (none contested) after a devastating breakthrough at Huesca!

Very interactive, it really plays fast & it oozes more history than the average CDG.

The 110 numbered event cards (55 for each player) are divided into two 1936/37 decks & two 1938/39 decks (one for each player as in "Paths of Glory"); if one wants to play a "historical" game, then the cards are drawn in numerical order (as in the historical variant for "Blue vs. Grey"). We simply divided up the cards into four decks - one for each year. That way events won't happen the year before they actually happened, but there's still an element of surprise.

We've also played with the naval expansion which is included with the English edition. Only two extra pages of rules & it adds a lot to the game - feels like a "natural" expansion. Wargame veterans should play with these rules from the start.

Thumbs up! My nicest boardgaming surprise of this year so far.

ESPAÑA 1936 is a game of historical simulation that recreates the facts occurred during the Spanish Civil War (1936-39).

It is played on a board depicting Spain and divided in connected zones, with counters at operational level. It has cards to develop the events of the war and to modify decisive battles. It does not have any CRT, and the combats are simple but real for the conflict. The turn and the combats are alternative, which creates a great interaction between the players. Thought for beginners and experts alike.

Spectacular, gorgeous, involving piece of conflict.  Antonio has crafted that rare gem: a labour of love and dedication which is an excellent experience for the player as well as for the designer.  Beautiful art, wonderful historicity.

I wanted to like this game and It didn't dissapoint. It felt different then anything else and I like the way combat worked. The dice lead to some exciting moments.

Looks like the game has a lot of legs. We didn't even look at the Navel rules yet. Great game.

A great wargame for begginers and a nice and quick to learn game for more experts. 
Can be used to teach how the war actually was if you just use the historical events in the cronological order.

Nice simple, slick wargame playable in an evening.  The Republicans are just trying to hold on, while the militarily superior nationalists are trying to isolate them and exploit a breakthrough.  The thematic flavor is excellently implemented, as diverse military traits like leadership, air and armored support, and even quality of troops are seamlessly integrated into the design in an easy-to-follow and understand fashion.  Admirable design.

My first card driven war game, I enjoy this alot though it seems hard for the republic to win (which I guess is pretty historically accurate *shrugs*) not sure about the naval additional rules, they seem to add little to teh game and un-neccessarily complicate play, not a huge history buff afore playing I have started some small reading into the period because of this game, the use of generals and support units i like alot, a good, solid game I will play alot assuming I can find willing opponants (I always seem to end up playing the nationalists, though intend to teach it to a very right wing freind)

A solid CDG game on the Spanish Civil War which overflowed into WWII.  This one is a notch easier than most GMT CDG games but has plenty of tension and fun for a wargame.  The naval rules however are riddled with ommisions and confusion as well as lacking good examples of the many situations that can come up.  The FAQ has cleared up many of the questions to include the naval rules.  Don't miss getting this gem.

Wargame ligero muy bueno, con cierta tensión y estrategia, que plantea cierto reto (sobretodo para el jugador republicano). Entra bien para no acostumbrados a juegos. Es un juego muy pensado, trabajado y estudiado, dado que se ajusta a la "realidad" y lógica de los sucesos en los que pretende instruir (y lo consigue). Pormenores: algunas reglas o situaciones (menores, pues no impide su juego normal) quedan dudosas, y su duración en partidas regañadas. Juego perfecto, divertido, para todos y "made in Spain", igual que su autor Antonio Catalán. Con la expansión La Armada para un juego avanzado con los barcos, más aviones y nuevas cartas. Con fundas tamaño magic 63x88mm.

A decent game, but the mechanics does not really suit me - too abstract for my liking. Sold it.

One play.  In our first game, we didn't understand the "8 contiguous boxes" victory condition (thought it had to do with 8 contiguous spaces not having markers rather than the spaces with your markers occupying fewer than 8 contiguous spaces).

It's a fun, quick-playing game.  It's asymmetrical and the Republican seems to have to make an ordered retreat like the Confederates in A House Divided or the Russians in The Caucasus Campaign.  Card-play is interesting.  We'll probably switch sides for one more play of the basic game and then look at the advanced game.

El juego es interesante y sencillo. Si se juega con la expansión de La Armada, aunque el aspecto aeronaval enriquece el juego, los combates no están bien resueltos; se dan situaciones surrealistas como acorazados hundiendo submarinos y derribando aviones con facilidad. Deberían cambiarse las reglas de combate aeronaval.

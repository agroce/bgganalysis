Love Letter Premium offers more or less the same experience with the original. A few extra characters add more variety to the mix while allowing greater player numbers without affecting the gameplay too much. Having more players is nice but it also means that you must sit idle for longer periods of time. After all the interesting part of the game takes place on your turn. Anyways, the game is fast flowing enough to warrant longer wait with the possibility of player elimination.

Loved the original Love Letter! Played all the time. I bought this because I was excited to be able to play with more than 4 people. We played with 8 and it felt like the game just went on FOREVER... I thought it would be a good opener since Love Letter was always so quick, but no one wanted to play anything else after this. I can't bring myself to play with a group again when there are much better large group games out there that everyone will enjoy.

This is a beautifully produced version of Love Letter, but should NOT be played with more than the original 2-4 player count. Once you add those extra characters no real deduction is possible and the game just starts giving out points willy nilly to get it over with.

Love Letter gets bigger in several ways.  Most obviously, the cards in this edition are bigger.  The larger artwork is nice, though it comes at some expense to ease of shuffling.  Then there are ten new characters, all with new abilities.  None are exactly game changing, but they do add a little variety.  Necessarily, three of those characters bring the possibility of scoring without winning the round because LLP plays with up to eight and the game really would drag otherwise.  It may drag all the same and, in my view Love Letter should be played fast or not at all.  If I didn't already own the basic set, I would probably buy this one for the nice production, added variety and the ability to accommodate a fifth player (but, seriously, no more).

// This is actually pretty amazing for twenty bucks. Not 
only does being able to play up to 8 people make this a 
much better family-night kind of game, but the production
value is pretty solid, making this a really strong choice
over vanilla Love Letter. It was kind of weird that they
didn't include fully transparent sleeves for the player
reference cards, but perhaps those weren't intended to be
sleeved at all? If that's the case, I'm not sure why it
included extra sleeves. (Very minor complaint.)

Best for 6 players. 15 minutes to learn. 1 minute to setup. 30 minutes to play a 6 players game.

This premium edition is a surprise improvement. My wife and I are completely satisfied by the very high quality of the components. I especially adore the love letter sleeves making the deck in the table looks like a stack of secret love letters. I always wanted this game to support more than 4 players and with the extension it now supports up to 8. The rules have became little bit confusing but it is still a very simple and fun game. Truly awesome improvement!

La versión para 8 jugadores de Love Letter. Las nuevas cartas son un poquito no tan buenas como las del juego original ya que en algunas ocasiones las cartas que permiten ganar fichas de afecto adicionales las dan de una manera muy fácil. Es complicado empezar a aprender este juego con muchos jugadores ya que son muchas cartas por aprender. Es mejor empezar con 4 jugadores el juego base y después pasar a las cartas nuevas.

Nice large, thick cards with sleeves. Components are great. The added characters are all interesting and work well. There are other ways now to gain affection tokens, which is interesting. With more players the game length increases, making the game less of a filler and more of a social gathering type game. Sort of along the lines of Citadels. It's not a main attraction and it's not a filler.

Love Letter with MOAR cards and MOAR players. What's not to like? 

Well, the play time goes up quite a bit with the new cards added, but this could just be remembering what they do and how the number spread changes. 

I love adding in a couple of cards when we're playing with 4/5/6 players, and then adding the whole extra deck when played with 7/8 to balance out the time though.

In general, I really like Love Letter (and most of its variants) but this has a few features that don't make it a "go-to" version of Love Letter for me:
* The cards aren't that great - I wouldn't use them without the sleeves and they are harder to shuffle
* Bigger size makes it less transportable

A good filler game. Not terribly deep, but that's a good thing in this game. Small, quick, portable, can be played anywhere with anyone. The light bluffing and card counting elements are fun when you need to kill a few minutes. Just don't try to fill an evening with it.

As for the 'premium' elements, I really like most of them. I don't think the game is quite quick enough to support a full 8 players though, but it can be okay if you just play to win a round versus the official 'x hearts to win the game' rule. But mixing in some of the variant roles into the base game adds a lot of variety.

Not a fan of the new Constable card, though. I get that he's in the game to help speed up the 8 player 'official' win, but he just feels cheap. There's not much way to counter a played Constable. If you knock them out, they get a heart; if you let them win the round, they get a heart. It's a win-win for whoever draws that card.

The ultimate filler game.  Can be taught in 3 minutes and all the nuances can be picked up after 2, 20-minute games.  My gaming group had several laugh-out-loud moments with tactical mistakes and successful backstabs. Very recommended.

Update: This game has received so much table time.  The fun factor just never dies down.

Update 2: Now that I have the Premium edition, I'll have to provide another update once I have a few games in with the new roles.  I'm worried the pace of the game is going to slow down to a crawl, but we'll see.

Update 3: Ok, I've played quite a bit with the extra cards in 5P games.  The game does slow down, but it's extremely enjoyable and the new characters add a surprising amount of depth and variety.  However, if you're looking for a quick game, do not play with more than 4P.

Classic Love Letter 2-4 players is wonderful. 
The bigger cards and sleeves are great! 
The 5-8 player addition is very hard. Interesting new take but highly recommend to play with folks who play Love letter frequently as it adds quite a few new characters with new abilities, which lead to a lot of people sitting around waiting as people read the cheat sheet card.

The 4 player game is great still, ie nothing has changed. The card quality and components are AMAZING! This game breaks down the orb higher player counts for me. When you play with 8 people it takes the fast paced nature of the game that makes love letter appealing, and makes it long and drawn out. It’s not horrible but I think it’s better with fewer players.

A nice upgrade to Love Letter, with some seriously chunky sleeved cards. New roles are provided to extend the player count up to 8. I've found that the game can drag with higher numbers of people though - information is spread too thinly round the table and it takes too long to reach your turn. You can still play old-style Love Letter with 2-4, but if you want to use the new roles I'd recommend 5-6.

This is a premium version of the great game "Love Letter."  I already own two other versions.  This one has big rigid cards with sleeves and a velvety box and heart shaped tokens.  It also has a bunch of other cards, but you only use them in large groups of people, which we don't have.  For that reason it's exactly the same as the usual love letters for me...perhaps with sleeves.

My comments on the original Love Letter:

[i]
Love Letter is a quick and simple role selection game that is really all about bluffing with a dash of deduction. The comparisons to Citadels are really inevitable. 

The component quality is not good, as the cards tend to show wear far too easily. In a game that relies on hidden information, this is a Bad Thing. Additionally, it comes in a drawstring bag, rather than a box. This would be annoying for any game in terms of putting it on your shelf, but it is an especially stupid way to store cards. 

In many ways, as mentioned, this game plays like a stripped-down version of Citadels. No money to deal with, no buildings or bonuses to keep track of. It simply awards you points for guessing your opponents' choices correctly. This is honestly a good improvement as Citadels can drag with more players. Unfortunately, Love Letter only supports 2-4 players, which are the same player counts when Citadels it at its best. 

Ultimately, I think it's a toss-up as to which one is better. I like the ability to support higher player counts that Citadels has, but the stripped-down simplicity of Love Letter is also appealing. There is room in a collection for both, but owning one already may significantly de-prioritize picking up the other.[/i]

Did they answer all my concerns with this edition or what? Better component quality, more player support, sensible storage. No-brainer to upgrade to this new edition.

While not as good as the vanilla Love Letter, the Premium version is still a very good filler with new roles and improved material.  The addition of new cards greatly reduce the deduction aspect (thoughts such as : "He might have played that because he has this card in his hand").  The overall feeling is a game that feels much more random.  With a total of 32 cards, the games last twice as long, which is a problem since player elimination is the heart of the gameplay.

Only online play at boardgamearena.com - Takes the simple and fast Love Letter and stretches it close to / beyond its limits. With almost thirty cards, the waiting time for players getting kicked out of the round early gets too long. A few of the new cards are very/too strong, especially the one that gives a player a token when he's kicked out of the round. That's almost like an auto-win card. Others make it very easy to kick a specific player out of the game or are a crapshoot.

There's still fun to be had and hilarious plays will happen. But now it's even more a social activity to pass the time while people focus on talking, drinking or something else.

Love Letter turned out to be a huge surprise for me. I had expected a drippy game, full of people making hearts with their hands and the suffocating stink of nosegays, but it isn’t. It’s a simple and entertaining card game of memory and deduction, with a lot of decisions to make – OK, minor decisions, but decisions nevertheless. 

Verdict: lots of laughter and chatter. 

Who on Earth thought it would be a good idea to take this perfectly solid “last man standing” party game and paste on a theme that if it were comprehensible would make no sense at all, and then go one worse and call it “Love Letter”?

This version plays exactly like the 4 player, it just takes a LOT longer if you play for hearts. The addition of the new characters in nice. Def a WOW on the large cards and the quality. The inclusion of customized sleeves is excellent. I've played with both 7 and 8 players and each round takes between 10 and 15 minutes. I still use this set for 4 players games because the cards and sleeves are so much nicer.

Love Letter Premium takes the familiar Love Letter game and enhances it in two different ways. First, the cards are supersized and much thicker than normal, the hearts that players claim are large and wooden, and the hard-sided box has a magnetic closure.

Second, the game now plays with up to eight players thanks to the inclusion of an additional set of cards, such as the Assassin (0) which eliminates an opponent if that opponent forces you to reveal it and the Sycophant (4) who must be the target of a played card until it's covered on the next turn. The rules for Love Letter Premium dictate which cards to use depending on the player count.

RATING: 5
The new cards have some interesting ideas, but besides the fact that in my limited sample size it seems like the cards that give you affection tokens even if you don't win the round can be really powerful, I think doubling the size of the deck just adds to much bloat. makes the proportion of rounds that end with the deck running out too low, which devalues having higher numbered cards, it makes card counting a lot more difficult, and it makes the game too long for what it is.

RATING: 4
Some new cards are very good (assassin, jester, constable, bishop), and the possibility of gain more token in one game is interesting.
But the good cards are only 4 and the game cost 30 euros without shipping.
The other cards are not good at all, the cardinal is just a way to certainly kill the second player you choose, the baroness, the sycophant and the count are useless, and the dowager queen sucks (every time you have it with the princess, and it often happens, you just have to kill yourself).
And the game is too big, not handy to transport, just to make you pay it more. 
My vote would be different if they would make an expansion same price and same size of the original, even if some cards are not good, if you play just with the good ones the game is very good. But again, if i add just 5 cards to the original i practically payed more than 6 euros for each new card, and it's not worth it.

This is a beautiful version of Love Letter, with a nice magnet box, large cards and heart tokens, great thematic sleeves, and of course, new roles to play up to 8. The game doesn't play all that much longer with more players due to the new powers which can win tokens to up to 4 players in one round. Some roles seem a tiny bit unbalanced with less players, certainly wouldn't recommend playing the new roles with a play count of 4.

Simple and plays quick. There is some opportunity for little mind games or misleading plays but overall just a high variance game of deduction.

Took a nice, fast little game and turned it into a long winded snoozer.  Additional roles ok, except a few that, when in the discard pile, will score at the end of the round.  I really don't like the fact your random draw can get you a quarter of the win, with little other players can do to affect it.  And it goes on way too long: with such a large deck, will you ever get to the end of the stack to decide by high card?  And the cost seems exhorbinant.

Fun and quick to play, Love Letter is a game of deception and luck, trying to guess your enemy's cards our playing the right card at the right time to save yourself is an excellent feeling. With this edition the biggest plus is that you can now play with up to 8 players, nobody is left out on the fun.
It's easy to learn and once you get the hang of it it's the perfect game to start the night and warm up for the more hardcore games.

RATING: 7.5
Extending the Love Letter to more players and growing the deck much bigger with more roles does the game both: good and bad. The good: possible to play it with more than 4 players, new interesting roles. Bad: longer playtime for such a simple filler and in case of more players there is some downtime also. So end result for me is that those are two a bit different games - one is a small fast filler, while other is a bigger, longer and more evolved game. Neither excludes the other for me.

RATING: 7
(1 play)  This is a great player elimination card game.  I was thrown off at first, thinking it would be just a little revamp of Love Letter.  This is a REALLY different game, event though it seems so similar.  We go from a short game for two couples to a room full of people stabbing each other in the back for over an hour.  It's very fun, but don't expect that elegant and quick little deduction game.  Expect a long game of TAKE THAT with a meta game that goes along with it.

Expands Love Letter with a few new roles which are cool, but are only for some reason to be used with 5+ players. But I've never really wanted to play Love Letter with so many players and increase the downtime by so much. But the components are nice and the premium edition nails that part.

I rated this lower than the regular Love Letter as it plays much slower once you add the extra 16 cards for player counts greater than 4. I do love the extra abilities that the new cards bring but I find the computation time and downtime increases as a result. This will most likely improve once players get to know the card abilities in order to deduce better.

The additional roles make for a more interesting game (more things to keep track of and do), but at the same time makes it more chaotic.  I actually liked that at first, until I realized each round also takes a lot longer.  Once I was about to win, I got killed each round early (that's just how love letter goes), and ended up sitting for long rounds time after time.  Good strategy on their part, but not very enjoyable.  I prefer the shorter/lighter game as a true filler, but this was ok if you are looking for something to play for an hour or so.

I'm a total sucker for quality components. I hate vanilla love letter with a burning passion but between the new roles and super high quality version of the components I figured this was worth owning. 

The drawback to this version is the game tends to drag taking it from 5-15 minutes to 30-45 minutes and it cracks start to become more pronounced at that point. I'll still bring it out as a filler but I won't be making space in my plastic tub for it.

tl;dr: mostly a cash grab

How to squeeze more money from a best seller? Create a version with bigger cards (for no reason) that are also three times as thick as normal cards (for no reason), add sleeves (with custom backs of course) and over sized wooden tokens, in a box with fake felt finish. Who's going to buy that? Many people. But you know what? This concept can be improved upon: add an expansion with new characters not available anywhere else. Haha, now everyone who has the base game who wants to play the expansion is forced to buy this over produced, over priced package!
OK, so much for my thoughts on the components of this thing. What's the expansion like, you ask? Well, it doubles the amount of cards and roles. There's some really cool ones, like the assassin, a 0, that knocks out the Guard if he asks the Assassin what role he is. There's also a card that I think is a bit overpowered (the Counselor, is almost guaranteed to give you a point).
In the end though I did feel like this expansion takes away much of the charm and cleanliness of the original. Therefore I will not be getting this. I already own the original.

I often wonder why some decisions are made - in several areas of life, but, in this case, particularly with games.

And now is the case with [thing=196326][/thing]. I'm sure that many avid players clamored by a party version (i.e: more players) of Love Letter. And considering the amount of copies the game has sold, cranking more versions of Love Letter became a market on itself.

Yet, from my point of view, I can't see why anyone would want a longer, more drawn out, with waaaaaaaaaay more downtime (specially if you are eliminated early) and much more bash the leader - as there is more players to do this. It is baffling.

[thing=196326][/thing] did tried to even things out, bringing some interesting new characters, like the Bishop, the Constable and the Jester, that can bring more points for a round - which is the hope for the game actually ending around the same time as a regular Love Letter game, still, they usually don't, as they use chance to work.

So, what you do get is a more chaotic game, with less chance for Guards to hit, some unexpected effects (specially more ties when using the Baron), that takes around 45 to 1 hour (not the 20-30 minutes mentioned in the game's page, which can happen, but more often than not is a lie), in which downtime is increased and the person herself play less. 

Lover Letter is a gem - it basically started the whole micro-game world (there were others before it, but none as ubiquitous, played and well known). Now it was, in [thing=196326][/thing], turned into a bloated mess. If I can't see why someone would want a game like this, I can see why it was made: money. I will do my part and say: stay away and be happy.

If you want to play Love Letter with 8 players this is not a completely shitty way to do it. However Love Letter, like Coup, is pretty uninteresting and uneventful with too many players.

The new cards also seem to be the worst kind of cards. There's some very interesting and unique cards like the Jester or Assassin but mostly the cards are either boring variations of already existing cards (Cardinal, Baroness, Dowager Queen, Bishop) or uninteresting (Sychophant, Count).

Love Letter however gets away with this bullshit scott free because it's one of the easiest games to setup, teach and play and the 8 player version, as bad as it is, fits more players easily. The cards on the premium edition are also extremely eye pleasing and enjoyably bulky. It's a game that demands attention with its huge cards and magnetic flip top box with felt compartments inside.

Also you can play the regular old 4 player version if you just remove the new cards or if feeling adventurous add the Assassin and/or Jester only.

I have yet to tire of this game and it has seen several hundreds of plays. This is destined to become a staple classic in gaming. So eloquent and refined yet always somewhat tactical. I love that a micro game can offer such depth and replay-ability. I WILL get the expansion eventually. Everyone should own this game, its a good gateway game, game night starter, filler. By now, I'm sure everyone has heard of this game.

As for the Premium edition, it really makes the is game even better, but is best with 5.

[b]Multiple sessions, ranging from 2p to 4p, base game[/b]:

Enjoyable filler with excellent components (great art, thick cards, durable sleeves albeit somewhat bit short, magnetic box) that's quick to learn and play. Player elimination isn't a problem seeing that rounds can end in a matter of minutes. Not much strategy (it's usually down to the luck of the draw) but you can occasionally bluff to help mitigate the randomness. While it plays alright at 2p I really wouldn't recommend it. Theme is pretty much irrelevant - maybe YOU are the card, being passed from character to character.

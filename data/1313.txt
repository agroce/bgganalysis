Very enjoyable 18XX game with a few new twists.  The 5 Share companies provide several decsiions who's timing can really affect game play.

Three playings, far apart in time.  Theres a lot to like here - 5 and 10 share corporations, national/government rails, destination runs, etc.  Some things make it harder to think through - hex based trains, national/government rail formations, etc.  I don't have a good handle on how this game "works" unlike 18EU, 1830 and 1870, but given more playing with a little less temporal displacement I'm sure I could.

Finally got to play this. We screwed up rules and had to rewind things several times which made the play irritating but I like the game. Completely underestimated the Belge and the north which, I think, threw me out of it by the 2nd or 3rd OR. The north is very powerful and green ticks don't upgrade which make tokens in the north and early placement critical. The 5-share/10-share mechanic was interesting but nothing especially exciting. I think once it's played more than once, it should be a quick game with some interesting decisions.

1826 is very much a game in the 1829 school meaning that it is almost purely focused on operations over stocks. While flipping stocks for financing is sometimes necessary, as it is in all 18XX games, for the most part this is a game of buying into corporations and trying to make them run as efficiently as possible.

There are a few interesting elements here:

First, companies start out with 5 shares, and can then convert to 10 after they have reached their destination. This pairs with immediate financing (i.e.: companies hold their own extra shares and as they are bought the money goes directly into their treasury vs. full capitalization when 50/60% of the shares have been sold) and creates some interesting space. Converting companies over costs immediate income but generates cash.

Second, there are two potential state railways that will swallow companies that are left without trains. The state railways are somewhat restrictive in that they must buy/sell trains to other companies at face, but they can also end up with a pretty wide swath of railheads depending on how many companies are folded into them. On occasion these can catch people unaware, but moreso the manipulation of these, and folding a company in at the right time create decision space.

Third, the trains themselves. They start out hex-based, but they convert over to city count based in the late game. The three permanent train types are 10 hex, 2(city)D(ouble)/3D/4D/5 (depending on how many have been sold and whether the last train type has come out) and permanent 3D. As the board features tighter distances in the north and much longer ones in the south, it is actually quite important to make sure that the right company gets the right train for the end game. Some companies desperately need the late-game city count trains, where others are perfectly fine with the big hex count ones.

Downsides? Not a lot. The Belgian state railway has been discussed as a powerhouse, and there's no question that it's an early game beast, as it has access to a lot of tightly packed cities that can make real use of the early hex-based trains. The designer obviously realized its power though, as it starts out as a 10 share company, and one of its shares is granted by a private, so it is up to the players to try and keep one person from monopolizing it as much as possible.

Aside from this, interesting title. I like the blend of elements in this one and see it coming out when our group is in the mood for ops over shenanigans. Those looking for a different-type of 18XX game to round out their collection should check this out. A bit on the longer side because of the 12,000F bank.

Based on one playing (it is a long game), this is my favourite 18xx. The French setting helps in this, but the play is absorbing and the presentation is very attractive  There is a useful, probably esential FAQ on the Blackwater Station site.

I like it but it is very restrictive... constantly had to remind myself that I couldn&#039;t sell trains amongst my companies.  Also the 5 share/10 share company thing made it very interesting but the one train limit for 5 share companies once the first 6H train is bought is hard to work around.  Needs more play to determine good strategy.  I think I prefer 1870 though because I enjoy the stock manipulation aspects not present in this game.

RATING: 8
A very strong, tough 18XX variant. The force merger mechanics that can take place twice in the game forces the players to plan well ahead of time and to attempt to not get caught without trains. Both mergers can be quite merciless as it is very possible to get caught and not get anything for the railroad you were running.
A few additional wrinkles in the form of H trains (runs a certain amount of hexes, not cities) and the E train (the more trains, the more cities they can reach, at double the income BUT only until the TGV comes out) means that it offers a quite unique experience.
Worth playing, but not for the timid/first time player. Can be quite brutal.

After 1 playing (and *right* after 1856): We did misplay in not having companies lay 2 yellow tiles on first turn, this would greatly help the beginning game.  There does not appear to be much benefit to starting further south and the game appeared to lack tension.  It may have been some group-think affecting the game (hold off on 10 share formation to keep the 5 shares as long as possible).  No tiles or tokens needed to be placed by any player (4 player game) during last 4 ORs, as final routes had been established.  Will try again, but there are better 18xx's out there.

2nd game revealed the potential token war; however, I felt like I was going through the motions.  Myself with 1 other player from game 1 joined with 2 new 1826 players (experienced 18xx-ers) and finished the game in 4.5 hours.  Tight game for top 3 players, but it seemed to lack something.  Probably has to do with the inability to have train swapping until near the late game.  Majority of strategy seem to arise out of the BORG and when / if / how to form it.  Lots of positioning for the Borg, but it is not as powerful as the 1856 borg...

This just wasn't for me.   I think a lot of my bad experience was that it's for experienced players and I was a complete newb jumping in a game of very experienced hard core 18XX sharks.   They gave me the barest minimal instruction and we started. My companyies were just chum for the sharks. Just think of trying to figure out what is going on while at the same time being dismembered. Just a bad experience all around.

There's nothing about an 18xx game that provides me any form of enjoyment, and so the prospect of spending another three hours(at minimum) per session at least half a dozen more times just to progress past the conscious incompetence stage is unappealing. The strategies and tactics of this genre will forever remain opaque to me.

Two unusual features stand out:
- Except the dominant Belgian railroad all other companies start out as minor and can be transformed to major companies once they reach their destination.
- The first four train types are measured in hex fields they can travel, not cities. The last two train types are odd variations on the double income from every major city type. It needs a bit getting used to and it happened more than once that the best track plans were getting ruined by one hex too much.
Among its other characteristics are two potential mergers, incremental capitalization, loans and unusual private companies that cannot be bought by major companies. A game for the experienced 18xx player. As with 18EU I'm not decided yet if I might like them or if my less positive gut feeling from the initial thrashings I got is right.

RATING: 8
A 18xx game about getting the right trains to the right companies in the endgame, with a hint of grabbing as much free money in the form of bank loans as possible. The maneuvering around the government companies is often interesting as well.

What isn't interesting is that in my experience it's basically impossible to do well without getting to run two companies in the endgame, and in a 4p game somebody is often left out. It's not just a share density question, but the absolute necessity for getting to double up on trains.

I'm not a fan of the hex-trains due to general fiddliness, even if they do serve a design purpose here.

I had fun playing it.  My rating could go up.  There is a higher degree of complexity in this game than any other 18xx I have played.  We figured it out mechanically.  But I surely didn't make any nuanced choices about the systems, trying to time my early corporations so they would be eligible for nationalization, or even how to exploit the various end game train types.

This game really demands a full understanding of all the rules, and I for one have to experience them before I can internalize them.  So chalk the first game up to learning.  But this one is complex enough that it is going to chew me up a few times before I get it right.

Good 18xx game, set in Belgium and France, with a few twists like hex trains, 5/10 shares, destination routes and nationalisation threats (unlike 1835 where you want to be part of the Prussian). Medium length - plays in about 6 hours.

I like the hex trains and also the end game in which you just double the value of 3 cities.

Intriguing twists in the standard 18xx repertoire: I liked the hex trains, and I thought the idea of the E train gaining range as the electric network develops was cool. However form phase 10H to TGV everything went so fast, that the E trains never got to run as something else than 5 trains.

All in all a very nice 18xx

A longer playing train game.  Played with two and it worked quite well.  Mainly centered about good track building and train management.  I really appreciated train ranges determined by a hex range rather than the standard 18xx number of cities.  I also liked how there were two nationalization periods, and the five/ten share availability.  Good game, and one of the largest range of simulated time in a train game: about 1826 to the 1970s.

France and Belgium:
A good iteration to the 18xx genre, but a little lacking in the stock market manipulation.  This is a timing style game where companies may be swollowed up by national companies at two different times during the game.  There is not a big threat of bankruptcy, but there is much screwage that can be done by timing the nationalization properly.

the initial auction has the outdated 1830 system (can buy the first private in the line)

the "hex trains" (trains run a certain amount of hexes, not stops) make certain places on the map (mainly the north and to a lesser extent the southeast) more important than others to the point that certain companies would never be competetive

my overall impression was that 1826 shows the fact that it was Hecht's first attempt at an 18xx as a designer, and i think it's an unfinished product--needs a few fixes

One to collect, but not to play.  Play is too restrictive on the finance side as compared to most 1830 variants, and doesn't have the engineering complexity of the better 1829 variants.

Lots of interesting choices.  The one problem is that the Alsace private is a real dog, so the private auction becomes an exercise in avoiding being forced to purchase it.  This, along with 18West and 18EU, is one of my favorite David Hecht designs.

18GL is basically the same game on a different map.

RATING: 7.75
Another great 18XX game. This is the first one I played that had the "H" trains.  WHich means if it is a 2H train it can go out two hexes from its starting hex. (TOuch three hexes total for income).

Different but still fun. 

It can be a bit routine though on what trains are started and when they well be started. I guess that is normal for 18XX titles but this seem/feels more than normal.

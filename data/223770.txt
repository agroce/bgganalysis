Initial rating based on one play of 2 rounds. 
Interesting game, felt like a strange mix of no thanks, pit, acquire and 6 nimmt

RATING: 7
First game we played with seven, and it seemed like there was just barely enough decision making to make the game interesting.  I suspect it might play best at 5, and not be too good at 3.  Overall, Startups a very simple, reasonably pleasant and interactive card game.

Works well with 3-5, 6 players makes the game too luck based. It is a fun little oink game that plays quickly and has beautiful graphic design.

It works but it's a bit dry and simple. It needs a bit more  unpredictability, like a real stock market.

Very simple game that has the most strategic options of any of the Oink games in my collection. Still a lot of luck but not a bad filler for most situations.

A clever little card game that gives some tough choices despite the game's simplicity. Players are vying for control of the various companies in the game, with the simple goal of having the most cards in each company they decide to play cards of.

At the end of the game, if you have more shares of a company than anyone else, anyone else with shares of that company must pay you. On the flip side, if you play cards where you don't end up the majority shareholder, you end up paying. Most money wins.

A pretty tense game of hand management, and a neat, but simple system of drawing/playing cards. I'll have to play more, as players really had no sense of what constituted good play in the first game (and I still don't really know!).

Heard about this on Board Game Blitz. Stock trading game to get a lot of stock in good companies. Has some mechanics about having to give points to other players, if they have controlling interest in the companies.

RATING: 7.5
Components: lovely components in a tiny box
Complex: easy to learn
Weight: light
Players: would say 5
Length: less than 30 mins
Mechanics: hand management
Decisions: enough, what to play, where to draw, where to invest
Opinion: here we have a very interesting economic game playable in less than 30 mins.
We could say that it's the standard game where you draw shares and play shares, in the end the one with the majority will earn something.... so far, it's standard. But here we have the anti monopoly rules, making it impossible for you to take shares from that company you are the CEO.
The best part is the end of the game, you have 3 cards on hand that would be played too, and all companies will be evaluated. Instead of receiving money for each share you have, only the CEO receives something, and it's the difference between his shares and the ones in player hands (if the CEO has 3, and you have 2...you have to play 1 chip), therefore you have to be the CEO in companies...but companies where other players have invested too, other way you will receive nothing.
Love this concept, you have to own lot of shares, be CEO in companies, but hide your movements, and don't be the lonely owner of the company

A fun and interesting stock accumulation game. Good clean graphic design. Strategy is somewhat limited by card draw and hidden information.

I got my butt kicked the first time we played this. I would love to play again to find out how to get better at it (although I think I did have a sucky hand). I like the mechanisms a lot, they aren't too exotic, but still feel fresh.

RATING: 5
山札から引くか場札から引くかはほぼほぼ最適解が明らかであり、手札から場に出すか場札として捨てるかも同様に明らかである。プレイヤーの選択として意思を込められる部分が少なく手応えがない。多人数のプレイだと自分の場に出す利点がほとんどないので手札の配り運と引き運によって勝敗が決まるように思う。

I quite like this. It is a simple stock ownership game with a nice twist that makes things very interesting. The early game is boring and could have been designed out, but it doesn't last long.

"Overall, I'm quite fond of Startups. I've played it a bunch, it's never been bad, and I've always had fun with it. It's a very simple concept for a game that remains interesting throughout the entire round, which I appreciate. There are just enough unknown things to make the game interesting, but you consistently have a lot of influence over your own hand, allowing you to have a bit of strategy. Sure, you might get unlucky one round, but the game is fast enough that you can just shuffle the cards, redeal the coins, and try again. I'd recommend giving it a whirl if you're looking for a nice, simple card game that supports a wide variety of player counts."

The stock/shares element is chrome over what's essentially a set-collecting game.  It might have been a byproduct of playing with 6, but it feels like once you start to get momentum and a sense of strategy in the round, it's already over.  Will be curious to see if it plays better with fewer players...

Played this twice yesterday from a friend who came back from Japan.  I would not be surprised if this becomes popular once it arrives to Europe and North America.  Very simple game with understandable mechanics but enough meaty decisions to make.

New Oink game! It has a lot in common with the predecessor game [thing=176458][/thing]. I like dthis one better. I think it is easier to understand and the colors are really nice and quirky. I will have to play a few more times to get better at it. One of the better Oink games IMO.

RATING: 3
I didn't feel it worked well with 3 players (BGG community says 4 is best; box says 2-7). The concept is fine and I was intrigued to start, but soon the restrictions kicked in and it ended up more an exercise in frustration than enticing the other players to make mistakes on your behalf, which is really what the game is about. Perhaps 4 or 5 players would work better; perhaps not. The game description states that you "have to be lucky" -- well, there you go.

RATING: 6
This was an interesting little game. Every card you keep and play has large impact on the overall state of the game, making every decision tense and interesting. It feels rather like Arboretum in this regard. 

The main downside I had in my play was that we had so few turns to actually effect our hands. But I think we were playing it as the max player count. I suspect this game may be really shine at around 4, and if I ever get to play it at that I may adjust my rating if the experience is what I hope. As is this was a fun game I'd gladly play again, but nothing so amazing that I'm rushing to play it again or spending much time thinking about how to play better.

Startups is a rudimentary stock game with leeching aspects woven between a thinly-veiled guise of set-collection. It is interesting how, with such a simple rule set, a cutthroat and player-driven meta-game develops. This game is heavy on player interaction since you ~will~ be constantly prowling your opponents' company shares if you want to stand a chance of making a profit. The open shares paired with blind removal of cards during setup contribute marvelously to the tension: claimed and available shares are easily discernible, to an extent, but the question is, are you seeing only what your opponents want you to see? Will your hidden hand "portfolio" actually pay off in the long run? The anti-monopoly tokens throw a wrench into all of this, which can reward/punish the smart/poor timing of card play.

For such a light game, each decision you make feels pleasantly weighty. I will concede, however, that my only major qualm is that the randomness starts to get out of hand at higher player counts, and try as you must, your plans will often be waylaid, or else you simply get lucky. Fortunately, the snappy length mitigates any risk of gameplay dragging on. At three or four players, the strategic nature of this game really shines, but I still find it fun with more players.

(+) Simple ruleset that allows for engrossing gameplay.
(+) Tension and player interaction abounds.
(+) A compact game that plays, comfortably, up to seven players. It must be commended for that.

(-) Luck of the draw begins to govern the game strongly at higher player counts. Not a surprise given you only ever have three cards in your hand.
(-) Rounds can end too abruptly sometimes. Again, more prevalent with higher player count.
(-) Longevity is in question, but in the end, fillers aren't made for that. Notable that I find it hard to fault many aspects of this game.

small package, accessible graphic design, few rules, easily replayable, quick, filler for medium-large group. the market doesn't really fill up as often as i expected which leads to a game of everyone hoping to topdeck a great card blind from the draw pile. needs to see more 4-player play, i think. great potential!

After the excellent Deep Sea Adventure and the interesting Troll, Oink Games does it again. Startups is another small game with a simple ruleset that offers original and interesting gameplay in a short time. And the graphic design is just beautiful. Straight on to my wishlist!

Excellent little filler with a lot of interaction and agonising decisions. For example putting shares on your tableau too early can be costly as you might not be able to get the shares in the marketplace after that. Also hoarding shares of companies can leave you a majority shareholder without any minority shareholders. Good stuff.

My only grievance is with the card quality. It's poor and need to be sleeved making it difficult to fit everything in the box.

Backed on Kickstarter. Can't wait to play--sounds great.

[updated] 

Just got mine and opened up the box. Wow! The components are gorgeous: thick tokens, great wooden bits, beautiful dice, and a huge, appropriately thick and beautifully-illustrated board that lies completely flat. (Highly durable box, too!) In short, I found everything to be absolutely first-rate, and I much appreciated the very classy thank-you for Kickstarter supporters and the lovely autograph on the cover.

Don Lloyd deserves a tip of the hat (a 500-gallon cowboy hat) for such a fine production. I really look forward to playing (which might be a little while before I can get to it, unfortunately). I also really look forward to checking out the Outlaw expansion, co-designed by up-and-coming designer Paul Incao. Congratulations all around! 

[updated]

Played Dark Horse at SaltCon, taught by the designer Don Lloyd himself. Very interesting game with a fair bit of depth and tough decisions to make. There is a lot to absorb at first, but as with all deeper games it requires one game just to learn how it all works. Lots to think about, very clever use of dice and components, and a good deal of fun to be had. It's a very well tested and thoughtful design, and I'm very impressed all around. And the Salty Troll custom expansion card for SaltCon was an unexpected and welcome bonus! :)

Basically a Wild West variant of Kingsburg. Not much here, really. There's little incentive built into the game to go with any of the thematic Wild West aspects over just going full euro-style for a win. Not a bad game but it tries too hard.

Just the right balance of strategy, luck, and player interaction. Very good components, a detailed rulebook, an excellent designer instructional video, and great user support. One of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. Highly recommend it. Originally rated this game as an "8", but after more plays, it's become a "9".

I had a lot of fun with this. It's basically Settlers meets Kingsburg. I thought the special powers were a little unbalanced (perhaps not playtested enough?) but I loved the city-building and train-building mechanics, and thought the game was competitive and challenging enough to warrant multiple plays.

Very enjoyable, like Stone Age but with vastly more replayability due to all the choices. Not a complex game other than having so many choices -- each action is itself simple. The dice manipulations to claim certain actions are unlike any of my other board games and fun.

High quality components. The colored wooden dice are large and chunky and feel great to roll.

Not a fan of the instruction manual.

A western-themed mixture of Kingsburg and Settlers of Catan but without any trading element.  I'm not a fan of either or those games, and I'm certainly not a fan of this one. 

What I found notable was how mind-bogglingly fiddly some rules were.  Tracks that connect at different points of a city hex don't count as connected?  Cities can only be built on hexes whose sides contain at least one track, while towns can be built if a track touches just a point?  Die modifiers cannot be used to reach the 3, 4, 5, 10, and 11 spaces, but they can be used for the other spaces, except if you're the Cowboy, who can modify to reach space 10, and excepting the Anvil because it doesn't count as a dice modifier?  

If you're gonna have rules like this, there's gotta be a payoff.  There's simply not one here.

While the gameplay appears to be designed for 'quick play' the end game drags on because there's little incentive for all but the winning player to end it.

A great, fast, roll some dice and take quick actions, get some resources, convert, score and race to the finish VPs game.  Some tweaks before the final cut made it much easier to flip, twist, and alter dice to achieve your objectives.  The final Kickstarted game is gorgeous, and can stand on any shelf with other professionally produced games, Rio Grande gamess watch out.  The thing I like about this game is that my wife, her friends, and my other medium gaming friends like it. Its not Agricola but its not suppose to be, and once people grasp it, it clips by at a nice pace, with decisions just interesting enough to be delicious, but not so taxing you cant have a beer and a conversation. Overall one of the best self produced games around in gameplay and appearance.

The rulebook is pretty terrible. It's poorly organized and filled with ambiguities, awkward wording, redundancies and (really) bad grammar. If you can find someone to teach you the game, you'll be far better off.

That being said, after you play a couple rounds, the game does move along quickly enough. It's a dice-roller with some interaction elements and resource management.

One complaint I have about the actual game (rulebook issues aside) is the numerous odd little rules--and rule exceptions--to remember... and they don't necessarily all make thematic sense.

Another more major complaint is that though the game offers you opportunities to make decent plans and strategies (like a more standard eurogame), luck will nonetheless determine the winner much of the time since it's such a low-scoring game. (A score of more than 25 would be pretty high... and there are often 6 points at stake based solely on who gets the lucky die roll to finish their final city first. Six more for me and six less for you is a swing of 12 points!)

Due to the extreme luck of this one, I'm actually wondering if it might be best as a solo game. However, I don't do any solo boardgaming, so I won't be trying that.

RATING: 2
NOTE: I am not a fan of dicey euros, generally.  Some of them can overcome the handicap, but most of the time they are flat at best.  Having said that - Wow, did I hate this.  Technically, it is a game, so I can't give it a rating of one.  But it rubbed me the wrong way in every way imaginable.  I can live with unclear rules and seemingly unbalanced special powers (at least for the Tracker).  I can even live with fairly high degrees of luck, though here the luck levels were off the charts.  But any game where rolling the wrong die or drawing the wrong card means you can't continue is just awful - this happened a lot.  I know there are cards and things you can take when this happens, but that doesn't make you feel any better when you waste turns and can't make progress toward your plans.  Spending two and a half hours watching the game play itself while I tried to coax it toward things I wanted was an exercise in pain management (30-90 minutes is on the box, but I don't believe it).  The only positive thing I can say is I thought the city tokens were quite cool.  Oh, and the designer is very friendly an approachable.  Your mileage may vary with the game.

RATING: 8
It's similar to settlers of Catan, except that the location of hexes that generate a resource are fixed and there is no robber. You roll two dice and the value of the dice allows you to choose an action (collect resources, build a building, etc.), similar to Kingsburg.  This allows blocking.  Enjoyable for newbies and veterans alike.

Don't buy/trade for this: too many "exclusive kickstarter' things that can't now be obtained and expansions that should have been part of the initial (retail) offer.

As you can't polish a turd, this is more money-spinner rather than game - but not with MY money!

Entertaining experience, I played a playtest/focus group game and it was gratifying to see our comments had some effects on the final version.

The role cards along with your starting resources help frame your strategy; mixed feeling about that. I wonder if you can change tack and still prevail. A IP/Gold strategy seems to be easily undone by many events and perceived leader bashing while a fortunate diverse mix of resources can only be slowed.

Overall a fun game when people play fast. Hint: moving up in the turn order is very important.

variable player powers IMO makes this game better. interesting mix of worker/die placement and resource/set collection building from catan. I give it 9 after one play because I believe this is the game you break ice with or the one you can get them hooked on after catan/stone age/alien frontiers/kingsburg. I also think the western theme fits this title well and the fluff for the characters is pretty cool.

card board crack is good.

RATING: 7.5
Kingsburg-like dice placement for action space selection.  Reasonably balanced actions with some tension.  Centered around a hex board with Catan-like building rules and three similar resources.  Scoring is different and there are more cards/ways to earn points.  Feels very similar to Catan.  Hope the expansion continues to differentiate this game from its influences as the farther it gets from them the better.

Played once, 4p.  Pretty decent alternative to Settlers.  Uses a mashup of Settlers mechanics and Puerto Rico role selection (kinda).  There are some unnecessarily fiddly rules, though - like, how the Sheriff works for example.  Also, while I liked the role cards (all players get a slightly different special abilities), I'm not sure they are necessary either.

Absolutely didn't enjoy this game. For whatever reason it just kept me disconnected and seemed too long to get any real traction in the game -and even as that traction started, the game ended. I was really frustrated throughout it and then was just annoyed at the end....

I definitely like Kingsburg & Alien Frontiers better than this. The theme was bleh on it and none of us felt like we were in a western theme or taking 'western' actions. Only have the 2 dice pretty much each turn made for a pretty painfully slow game.

I have great respect for this game. It's beautifully thematic, and I know a lot of people who've loved it. It just wasn't for us. It took me 45-60 minutes to explain the game because there are a lot of little rules that players need to know. Yet, when you start to play, it's actually a very light game with a lot of luck involved. We prefer games that are easy to explain but with a lot of depth when you start to play (like Le Havre).

Don, the creator of the game, was gracious enough to walk us through his game Dark Horse.  Interesting roll selection similar to kingsburg, but with an added exploration mechanic as well.

I enjoyed the game, though I think others in my game group enjoyed it more than I did.

I got a little burned by my initial placement at the beginning.  After a little exploration it became clear that I had no ore on my portion of the map and that really messed with any strategy I had going.

That being said, I'd play this game in again in a heartbeat.

Decent, a solid "7". We found most players (all 4 playing for the first time) got struck with AP more often than not. Dice rolls with way too high of a chance for LESSTHAN6* rolls  and too many of those options requiring exact dice numbers and/or only being able to be occupied by a single player in a turn almost always limited if not outright eliminated options more than anything. I personally went THREE turns where I couldn't even build and that sucked. It seemed to be very much an exercise of too much to have to do to progress/win, and way too little chances to actually DO any of it.

Character cards seemed unbalanced (some got to use them a LOT more than others). Didn't see or play anywhere near the amount of event/action cards than we probably should have, had we been more familiar with the game (players tended to mostly avoid selecting card options, not knowing the consequences of playing the cards options).

I'm intrigued enough to give it another try if others are playing, but not enough where if I was picking the game that I'd suggest it.

dice rolling / worker placement in a different enough way to separate itself from the inevitable kingsburg/alien frontiers comparisons.  

end game scoring seems to suffer from a bit of min/maxing, but i think this might go away with a few more plays.  i like the ways that characters work and the many uses for dice.  rail access can be a bit of a bottleneck that everyone should be aware of going into the game.

--- Preliminary thoughts ---
Kingsburg, but instead of raising buildings and fighting monsters, you expand over a map [hexes] with resources.

I just have a bunch of ideas about the game that will probably be wrong. Need playing time!
-> Multiple paths to victory? 
-> Great components!
-> The game is a bit long and advances too slow?
-> Replayability is in question [as it happens with Kingsburg until the expansion]. Gotta check the expansion 
-> "Kickstarter hype"? in BGG until dust settles up.

None of these possible issues seem too serious and I like the genres. Nonetheless, it is very difficult to find at present time.

Rating can improve unless I confirm all the above.

Full disclosure: I am part of the Knight Works development team. I was only involved with the game at the tail end of the project and took on the role of assisting with last minute creative development, game editing and game balancing. 

Unlike most dice euros which are primarily focused on worker placement with resource collection, players leverage their dice to perform actions which help to move them further along towards two possible game end conditions (one which is based on building out a certain number cities and towns within a player's established and opponent sought after territory map and the other being a victory point race). Add to this some fun and thematic card play options and this game really has something for every type of gamer.

Dark Horse in my opinion has just the right number of decisions and paths to victory. Since there are two game end conditions you never know when the game will end which creates tension and a good narrative arc to the game. The typical dice randomness in many games is kept in check by leveraging unique die modifier mechanics integrated with interesting card play abilities. In my opinion the theme is integrated well with the unique asymmetrical character roles. 

The optimal gameplay experience is had when players are best utilizing their unique character abilities to build an engine leading towards one of the two paths to victory. This may take a few games to figure out....but to dumb it down...some players should pursue building all their cities and towns and maximizing build/terriory points while others should focus on collecting gold, influence points and ultimately victory points. You may want to play your first game without the character abilities.

The Outlaw Promo expansion which will be included in the box for all Kickstarters and preorder customers is something I co-designed with Don Lloyd. It consists of a set of mechanics developed with future developement of the game in mind....a hint of additional levels of interaction that will be added to the game in the planned expansion already in the works. The Outlaw will be more heavily intergrated into this expansion than it currently is in the basegame.

This game is kind of a mess. I am writing and rating this now a while after I've played, so my memory is a little fuzzy, but it needed to be done. I do remember that Sheriff is underpowered by quite a bit compared to Mayor. Action selection is pretty lackluster and the building mechanics seem like they were thought up by Ben Wyatt of Parks and Rec, just put whatever in there from whatever game and see if it works. In fact, I feel like this is what Cones of Dunshire would actually play like if it were a real game.

A bit confusing at first, especially since the rulebook doesn't clearly define when to do certain actions. Teaching Dark Horse is a beast, since there are so many stipulations and restrictions to cover. Still, I like that no matter what I roll I can usually take a useful action, at least until I'm trying to end the game but can't roll a build action. 

Overall,sometimes the end game can drag on, or you'll get a crappy setup and someone else will get an overpowered card, but the game is pretty smart for an independent design and I'm still looking forward to more plays.

It's almost but not really a game of Catan meets Castles of Burgundy with a wild west theme. While I find that I really don't like Catan, Dark Horse is actually pretty fun. The exploration bit can be a little irritating at times, but the dice rolling and action buying aspect creates some player interaction that is amazing.

Unfortunately, this type of game can tend towards a competitive solitaire if you let it. If you want more player interaction though, you can definitely achieve it.

Once I added in the expansions, the game really kicked up several notches for me. If you're going to get the game, get the big box Rebels and Rogues expansion. It's very, very much worth it!

It's not often that I don't like a train game, but this is one of those rare exceptions that proves the rule.  In hindsight, it is not unreasonable to think this might not be a favorite.  After all, I am not a fan of longish dice games in general.  I really do not like Kingsburg, to which this has some great similarities.

The first problem we had is that we never felt like we had all that many options.  Even when we were able to manipulate rolls, we still felt as though things we too constrained.  We just couldn't do what we wanted to do and using what we were given was generally tedious (and annoying).  Because of this, the game seemed to develop really slowly.  That just added to the tedium for us.

This may be related to the general slowness of the game, but the entire map portion of the game seemed almost completely superfluous.  That's not a good thing for someone who loves train games.  At any rate, we were thankful when the game finally ended.  I'm glad a passed (barely) on the Kickstarter for this one.  [11/22/2012]

The rulebook isn't that straight forward and you need to be very careful of the dice symbols.  For our first game, we were playing the Pioneer and had too many cards being used (which requires a natural 1 and another die).  We also didn't resolve the Dealer option correctly where you place your die on the spot and then move it after the placement of the Dealer.  The game shipped with a correction included, which is never a good sign.

Really like this game.  Easy to teach.  Super quick turns.  Minimal AP and I love the theme.  I feel that the worker placement and developing and placing of your cities / towns really give this game a great feel.  The only issue I have with this game is I feel there is not enough action cards in the game.  I feel when I use the pioneer action too often I will draw two event cards that will force me to reshuffle the whole deck.  I don't like this rule it's seems unnecessary.  I will be "House Ruling" this and just choosing the first Event Card and placing the second one in the discard pile.

Played for the first time tonight from special kickstarter edition handmade from the designer.  I plan to write a full review, but in the meantime I will tell you that it is a very interesting game.  Dice placement, and city building.  Has a little Carson City feel, but has unique Characters with Abilities and Attributes for each player.  Also cards that you can draw that create gamewide Events, and or specific actions for that player.  Anyway need a few more plays and rule clarifications, but definetly one to pick up.  A lot of thought and effort have been put into this game, and I feel it should be supported!

I've just played it twice so far, but "Settlers of Kingsburg" is fun so far. The rules have a few holes, and some of iconography on the board could be improved, but overall I'm happy with my Kickstarter purchase.

Players roll dice, then assign those dice onto various spots on the board that provide benefits. This is where the Kingsburg comparison comes in, as you can split your dice, combine them and so on to reach higher spots, etc. There are dice modifiers and re-roll tokens, so there are lots of ways of using the dice. One of my favourite bits of this part is that certain spots require exact rolls, which means you may need to reroll to get a 5, rather than being able to automatically turn a 4 or 6 into it. This does up the luck factor though, so some won't like that. Individual role cards and a deck of event/action cards provides lots of variability as well.

Mixed in with this Kingsburg dice rolling / placement is a Catan like building of cities on the board. Cities and rails give you access to resource squares, which you build towns on, then produce resources for you when you place dice on the Produce action. This is where most of your points come from, as you gain points for each town connected by rail to your cities.

I should mention that the production values are top notch here, nice thick cardboard, and the wooden cities are simply brilliant.

Laying your network of rail in the Old west with tile laying, worker placement, and resource management. Each player has a special identity and dice rolling determines your actions.  This game seems well balanced, encourages fast play and has similarities with Catan and Alien Frontiers.  My wife loves Catan so I might need to reconsider this one.

A worker placement game with theme.  Real theme!   This is what hit me as I first played it.  Placed in the American West during the mid-1800s, your goal is to build the most successful territory.  Build towns, cities and rail-lines.  Use the natural resources to the best of your ability.  Be efficient--as most worker placement games demand from you.

This game contains cards that add an element of theme which accord special abilities and transports you into a deeper mindset of a frontier settler.  Many roles and their abilities can be played with, each with it's own personality.  Fun stuff.  The text on the cards even bring a rose to your cheeks.  It's hard to not smile at the thematic text.

A simple game, it trips you up at first because of the number of options you have every turn.  Read the instructions and take it slow.  If you need help, there are a number of great videos on BGG to help you through some of the questionable rules you may wonder about.  You'll soon catch on and intuitively make decisions without trying to remember each phase or element of the game.

My personal favorite is Richard Ham's.  His BGG name is rahdo and the link to his video is here:

The components are superb.  Good card stock for the cards and bits, and they are coated in some type of wax or silicon that feels fantastic.  I love the artwork.

It's designer, Mr. Don Lloyd, has been planning for an expansion next year (2013) that will add more theme and allowing for a deeper element of decision-making.

I'm looking forward to it.  This game is solidly designed, is a good family game, and has a unique feel to it that I don't have with other worker-placement games.  

Come on, pilgrim!  Pull on yer boots an' ride down yonder to Dark Horse!  :)

I now divide my life into two parts:

Part 1: The days of yore, before I played Dark Horse.  Butterflies would tickle my nose, strangers would deliver candied delicacies, and every morning would start with a twinkle, flash, and smile.

Part 2: I play Dark Horse, then I spend the rest of my life with one hand in a garbage disposal - the other on the power switch - trying to distract myself from the wretched DH memories.  Will I shred my limbs, or won't I?    On...or off? Only I can decide.

What I have learned, unfortunately, is that once you play a game it can never be unplayed.

Takes what I did not care for in Alien Frontiers and works similar mechanics with much more finesse.
Using the jail as a similar "Raider's Outpost" and lose dice instead of resources... brilliant!
Trying to trade for it, and all the expansions...can not wait till I get an actual copy I can play solo and make new fans of DH, with my game groups!

This might be a 10, if I can get a copy and introduce it to my different game groups... stay tuned!

I am now an official playtester for Knight Works games!!

UPDATE- Dec with prototype expansion.
With the expansion material it is the best dice-worker placement out there.
You get so much extra "stuff" in Rebels and Rouges that it boggles the mind. 
It should be full game not an expansion, but lucky for us it is and live on KS (as of 12/13).

This is based on a couple of learning plays. I can see how the mechanisms click together. It's a nicely themed dice placement and resource management game. I went whole hog on this and have a bunch of expansions that I haven't even touched yet. Scratches the same itch as Kingsburg, with quite a bit more depth. The western theme is a huge plus, as is the fact that the game's designer (Don Lloyd) is an incredibly nice man. Looking forward to more expansions (to hopefully play eventually, heh). The solitaire rules and the 2 player scaling makes this game playable from 1-5. Recommended!

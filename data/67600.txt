Purchased from ding/dent stock at local store.  2nd edition is better--cleaner map with corrections included.  Haven't finished first game yet, but field of fire mechanism is good and overall mechanism feels pretty nimble.  Doesn't feel too bogged down, which is good, because your units will be once they hit the beach!

RATING: 8.5
Impressive diceless solitaire system. A great game. But be warned: the first time you try to decipher japanese fire will take you lots of time. And it will even get more complicated. The game adds details with almost every turn. You have to keep a lot of ifs and thens in mind. But, after you play the first scenario over and over again you gain speed and it becomes fast, at least most of the time. We're not talking about winning here :-)
The second scenario, which expands the first adds more rules. The third scenario expands the first and second. This will give you the whole landing and battle for the island.

It is complicated, but it is one of the best solitaire games out there. I have never encountered a better game about island landings in the pacific theater of World War II.

This is my first D-day game i have played and it surely didnt disappoint me. After 2 plays with most rules learned this game flows quite easily and provides quite many nail biting moments.

Great game, will have to get other D-day games too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Almost as good as the first game in the series. 
(see my comment for D-Day at Omaha Beach)
The fact that the core rules are exactly the same is a great plus on my book.
The close combat rules are definitely an improvement and the disembarking process of the marines is really interesting.
I just think that Tarawa is a little more luck-dependent than Omaha. 

John Butterfield is really the king of solitaire designs.

EDIT after 10 plays: 

I am a serial player of D-Day Omaha and my victory rate there is around 40%.

At Tarawa, after 10 games of the 2-day campaign, my win rate is still 0%. And I don't feel that I'm getting more proficient with the system and closer to a victory with every play (like it happened with the Omaha game). I've learned a lot and I believe I'm approaching advance and combat in an intelligent way, but victory always seems just too far. 

My difficulty is that the victory conditions are just too harsh: Securing all the positions in [b]four[/b] of the island zones is close to impossible, IMO. Not having to secure all positions that project FoF over these positions, like someone suggested, would certainly help. But I am of the opinion that the problem is the sheer number of positions you have to control. 4 of the island zones is too much. 

In my last game I have secured, by game end, all positions at zones B, D, E, most positions at F and a couple at A and C. If you looked at the general situation of the battlefield, the Marines were well positioned, with various 3 and some 4-step units, tanks, artillery and 4 support engineering units, while the Japanese were scattered, mostly disrupted and only a few with depth markers. In my opinion, total obliteration of the defensive forces was just a matter of time. 

But, instead of achieving a tactical victory, it was a loss. That is too harsh, IMO.

I tend to agree with fellow gamers that it would be really nice to see some basic rules proposed by the game's developers that allowed for a 30-40% victory rate (it was a really hard historical engagement after all!).

A few modifications to Tarawa's rules that might make it winnable would be:

- Securing all positions in 3 (instead of 4) island zones, the majority in 1 and at least 1 position in the other 2.
- Securing means occupying it with a unit or garrison, with no japanese unit projecting FoF on it (rather than having to occupy even empty positions that project fire on them).
- You can Attack and CC Japanese positions in the same turn.
- Automatic death of the Japanese Admiral at T16.
- HQ destruction on amphibious landing is impossible. You only check for drift.

I'll try these modifications and see what happens.

Wonderfully immersive solitaire system, following the footsteps of D-Day at Omaha Beach. The core system is the same and the new additions (Japanese actions, Close Combat) are easy to understand and fun to play. Newcomers may take some practice to get use to the system, but it's really worth the effort. This game will spend many happy weekends and evenings on my table.

D-day at Omaha Beach is one of my favourite games of all time. This game is not nearly as good. The map is smaller, busier, with some poor colour choices and tiny symbols. It's frankly not very well made. The rules contain more ambiguities and some vital processes are poorly explained. The victory conditions are nearly unobtainable - much harder than DDaOB. I'm also still undecided about some of the new game mechanics (e.g. Close Combat). Edit: after playing the game a dozen times I've come to the conclusion that luck is much too important in this game - much more so than in its sister games. If you want to play this system in the Pacific setting, choose DDaP instead.

Finally, after weeks of waiting on my shelf I managed to play a game of D-Day at Tarawa and it was strange.

First I felt overwhelmed: it felt like I didn't read the rules at all. I had to check almost everything I did because I didn't want to miss any rule.
Once the game was running it was pretty smooth.

It is far away from easy but so much fun that it is ok that you get beat down every second. Hopefully that gets better. Hopefully it's not all the luck of the draw.

Just win my first "First Waves" scenario. Game is very tense, challenging, narrative with real historical flavor, just as its predecessor in this series.
It also looks more difficult than Omaha at first view 
and a little more complex: it is easier to overlook the new rules or to forget some parameters during the play.
Clearly not the good title to start the series but a must have for any Omaha enthusiam.

Great addition to D-day at Omaha Beach. The game is addictive, just like it's predecessor. Luck does, however, play a more important role for the landings than in D-day at Omaha beach. The game can almost be lost after 4 turns, which is not the case for D-day at Omaha Beach.

I'm not exactly sure how to conclude my feelings for this one. On one hand, I find the gameplay absolutely compelling in terms of the decisions I have on my turn. On the other, I find managing the AI more work than I'd like, though manageable with repeated plays.

The big hangup is how it's tuned. I'm all for a challenge, but this one seems tuned to a level of relentless difficulty that I'm not sure good play can mitigate without some extremely rare luck. I want a game where I can point to my good play as affecting the outcome, but here the game can come crashing down on you with some extremely unfortunate circumstances no matter how well you play. Random hidden units, random events, random movements and actions. It's all so random without feeling like you can learn from your 10-15 hour investment and come back with a different approach. Next time will just be randomly difficult in a different way. 

My gut feel is that the game is not quite what I want it to be. I want less of a guessing game and more of a learning experience. I'm objective enough to consider I may be missing something. Perhaps I'll learn something from the forums that informs me and energizes me about playing it again.  

UPDATE: Criticisms such as mine have been heard and there are new official rules (see Files). I've yet to try them but intend to as I very much liked the game's promise. 

Also: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1651639/japanese-tanks-designers-intent

Reminders:

If any position hexes in a Japanese position group are occupied by Japanese units, the position is considered occupied when determining which action the position conducts during the Japanese Action Phase. Therefore a Japanese position group with only one of its three position hexes occupied by a Japanese unit is not eligible to conduct the Reinforce or Muster action.

A position group that is completely unoccupied by Japanese units receives a unit and depth marker in just one unoccupied position hex when eligible to perform the Reinforce action. 

A position group that is completely unoccupied by Japanese units receives a unit (and no depth marker) in every unoccupied position hex in the group when eligible to perform the Muster action.

Tank units always perform tank actions, even if in a position group with other units. In this situation, the tank unit performs a multiple fire action and the other unit performs a separate fire action with machine guns. The unit in the westernmost position performs its action first.

A great challenge. 
Intricate rules take some getting used to - four games in and I'm still making significant oversights. Yet, a well thought out game that's achievable (I hope) and I do enjoy the card system over dice - to my small mind it seems that the card system is more predestined than the more luckier roll of a dice.
500 million Americans can only be grateful that I wasn't overseeing the invasion

It's a darned good thing the 2nd Marine Division was better at their job on Nov 20,1943 than I am playing this game. So far after 8 or 9 plays I haven't won yet.  But I keep coming back over and over. The game is immersive and feels true to its subject. The system makes the AI behave as the Japanese forces should act. Despite superior numbers and weaponry, the Americans are forced into a short range slugging match.  Each decision I make often has epic consequences. My only real complaint is the counters are poorly cut and not as well made as say Dan Verssen counters. I wish the map was mounted. This game is so good it made me want to read about the actual event. And it made me automatically want the next in the series D-Day at Peleliu (due out sometime in next few weeks).

Man, this game is tough. I've always enjoyed my games though, even the ones that lost horribly. Fortunately the ones that have gone badly don't need to be played right to the end. I went for Tarawa over Omaha as I wanted something that represented a complete battle - Omaha is obviously just one beach from a larger battle formed of five beaches.

Edit: I changed my rating from 7 to 9 as a result of the changes the game designer made to the rules to make the game a little less arbitrary and a little more winnable. With these changes it is a fabulously tense battle!

I think I prefer this game to it's predecessor as there are more options available and there is only the need to resolve one firecard. I prefer the landing Phase too in Tawara. 

But anyway, the map is flawed as the position icons aren't printed on the hex outline but on the center of the hex, a place that is always hidden under a stack of counters... Who came up with that idea?

For the design effort that went into this it is a clear 10. The implementation of the AI is first class. It is the best solitaire AI ever made up to now.

1. Ended on turn 5 by my wife dropping tomatoes on the map.
2. Ended turn 10: 5 VP
3. Ended turn 10: 10 VP, 1 HQ lost...

Excellent but tough game. Generally takes multiple sittings to play through the full scenario unless you have a completely free Saturday or Sunday. 

Very impressed with how the AI emulates so many facets of the flow of battle. More than once I thought I was making progress only to have defenders reinforce or redeploy and completely throw a wrench in the works. It's largely dictated by the luck of the draw, but that variability also contributes to the replay value. It also provides a bit of welcome tension to game play.

Played through the 10 turn scenario once and the full scenario twice and have yet to win, although I was only two positions shy of securing victory my last time through.

Would definitely recommend downloading the flip book available in the files section for this. It's well laid out and streamlines play.

I played my first game and I liked it. It flows well, the cards do a good job of managing random outcomes (LVT arriving to the beach, events, close combat, Japanese and American results). The rules are fairly intuitive and the major items are summarized on the player aid. My minor gripe is that position color and fields of fire are sometime difficult to make out: you have to move the pieces to see the position and some of the position colors look similar. I called it quits after my first session because I was starting to have a headache. But I wouldn't mind playing again.

Cadillac design forced onto a Yugo body frame by Decision Games - this should have been a gem, but is marred by the typical DG exasperating (read cheap) production (missing components, misaligned counters on back, poor die cut, b&w play aids, no outlines around positions, etc.).

Otherwise, a good color rule book with examples and some interesting tweaks from Omaha Beach (close combat being the most noteworthy). Even if familiar with Omaha Beach, still read the entire rule book - this is a complex solo system that will play more smoothly once some experience is gained. There are some key rules here that will spoil the session if not implemented properly. 

Initial play impressions are good - Butterfield is indeed the solo master. The game tells a very thematic narrative (with an abundance of luck).

Update: rating lowered as the game is futile.

Second entry in the D-Day series. 2nd edition is a must as it corrects the flawed map of the first printing.

Another winner.

Tentative rating after one introductory game.  I like the fact that the mechanics are different than other games.  I found the board to be hard to read if you are color blind.  I had a hard time getting into the game.  I would randomly reduce units based on the Japanes fire card, but I did not feel like I was in a battle since many of the units did nothing turn after turn.  I prefer Omaha Beach.  I did not feel the new mechanics enhanced the game and I did not find this scenario as interesting.

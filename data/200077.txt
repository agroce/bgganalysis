Fun, simple, little pocket sized game.  Ideal to take on a trip and for something quick to play.  Over very soon sometimes and little time/room for establishing a real strategy.  Limited by a bit of bad luck (or good luck for your opponent) in the card draw early on can pretty much seal the result of the game unless you're very lucky later.

Mint Works is an excellent, little, worker placement game that's very easy to pick up both figuratively and literally. The rules are simple, yet really scratch that gamer itch unlike some other pocket sized games which lack enough gameplay to feel like a full fledged game. I've played this with many different non-gamers, and they all caught on quickly and loved it. It is now my go-to game when teaching worker placement to noobs.... ahem...  I mean, non-gamers.

The only thing I would have liked to see different is for the theme to gel more throughout the locations. I get what they were trying to achieve here, but I would have liked to see the locations be more 'mint' themed... They are definitely more "worker" themed, as the locations are things like a factory, mine, workshop... It just all comes in a mint tin, and I sort of expected it to be more mint/candy themed... but that's a really small detail.

Other games, like the stick-o-game series, try to do what Mint Works actually achieves - and that's to give you a big box game feel in a pocket sized container.  In magician terms: Mint Works packs small and plays big. This is a game I tend to bring with me all the time, ready to bring to the table when having coffee with friends or waiting for dinner to arrive at a restaurant. Most of my small sized games go into a large bin, out of sight, until I feel like digging through it. Mint Works stays on the table or always within reach.

Inarguably perfect game.

• Component quality is stellar, especially for a pocket game? Linen card stock with heavy gloss to protect it from sandwiches and drink spills! Durable wooden pieces. Just nice.

• Graphic design was A+. As a designer myself, I heartily approve of simple, clean, and effective design. There's nothing wrong with using open graphics from game-icons.net either :)

• Game box is A++++. A custom mint freaking tin you can carry in your pocket. And it's more resistant to bending than an Altoids tin.

• This game is beyond perfect for getting your nongamer friends to try games. Easy to learn, easy to teach, easy to master.

• It's an extremely comfy 2player worker-placement game and extends to 4players for when you have company.

• Advanced action cards add a huge amount of variance to such a small and basic game. This is the real kind of forethought that designers need to be putting into their games.

• The solo cards also give you something to do when you're alone and bored while you wait somewhere.

GO BUY THIS GAME. RIGHT NOW.

Great streamlined worker placement game. Is the mint tin packaging a gimmick? Maybe. But it works. I'm really impressed at how much fun this game manages to be while being so streamlined and small.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Pretty good. Solid, small, easy to teach, etc.

I haven't played it much so far, but I do have a few concerns:

1) Because the number of slots on the 'purchase' card doesn't change with the number of players, once you go past three players, the ability to get buildings quickly becomes a matter of seating order. If you're last in line, then tough luck to you this round, and if you aren't getting buildings, you ain't gonna get points.
2) Because the game is so short, getting the 'best' cards is of critical importance, which means that being earlier in the turn order is of critical importance. But this can mean that you end up benefiting simply by having the person next to you spending a mint to get first place. Now you're second, and you didn't do anything for it.
3) Because the game is so short, there's not much mitigation for what order the cards came out of and how that maps to who gets them.

Basically, winning is going to be pretty random. Now, granted, while others are buying, you're earning money, so that you'll be able to buy more next time. If you know you're not going to get anything this round, you may as well grab the first place marker and start saving up money. But you can't spend many rounds saving money if you want to win.

That said, most of this can be mitigated by simply playing to a higher target number. If the game is longer, there will be less random effect impacting the result. Or, alternately, just play a lot more rounds and keep tally. (Or, like me, don't care too much about who wins and loses.) But I would like to see alternate paths to victory than buying buildings and, in particular, a more useful income-generation strategy. So I'd look forward to an expansion that added more worker placement cards and suggested a higher target score and/or alternate win conditions.

For the moment, though, I might suggest tossing the card for buying plans, draw as many plans as players, and putting your mints directly on the plan card to purchase them (or simply tossing them back in the tin). And then tune the target score to whatever you find fun for yourself, rather than sticking solid to the number suggested by the game.

Print and play version (backed Kickstarter).  What a fun little game in such a small package.  Have played about 10 games or so and it's cool there are different strategies to win.  I didn't feel like one card would win it for you by default.  You really have to play the best of what is showing.  I've had a great game where it was a race of the Assembler versus the Vault, fast paced the whole time.  Love that this doesn't take up much space, played on the table at the pub, worked fantastic.  8.5 rating for now leaving room for this to go up if I continue to enjoy it or down if it grows stale.

Usually, the cheap and small games turn out, at best, to be, "impressive given that it's cheap and small!" Which is to say, something that would fall apart if larger and more costly. While I can't picture what a deluxe version of this would look like, or why you'd make one, I think it's a surprisingly complete and enjoyable game, and really a flag-bearer for how small Kickstarter type games should go. Very happy to play, and not just because it fits in my pocket.

Very cool little worker placement game.
The buildings have nice, powerful abilities. Design is great too.

2p game impressions:
The game ends real fast, so we decided to go up to 10 stars which I think made the game more fun.

This is a small game so as expected it can get samey after a while but I think these kinds of games are not meant to be played every day anyways (for travel, holiday, restaurant etc. :) ) so it's fine by me.

Our last game of the evening, 3 player. This is a tight worker placement game that plays super fast. I think our game was over in 15 minutes with Brian winning a tie breaker over Brett. Buy Plan cards into your hand and then play them out using your mints (workers). The Plan cards have all sorts of unique abilities. This one is a definite keeper. One, it has some awesome solitaire potential (with multiple AI opponents) and I think Flo will enjoy it quite a bit. Just don't eat your workers!

This has replaced Onirim as my go-to solitaire game. It's a really engaging solo experience, but doesn't come with the play time that often deters me from solo gaming. Looking forward to playing it against a human opponent - but really enjoying it as a solo experience so far! The whole package of the game, its packaging and its theme sits perfectly on the right side of "cute" - very well judged and well implemented. Glad I backed the kickstarter.

This game packs a lot into this mint tin. Since the mint tin is still very tiny, however, the game is still feather-light. It's still a decent filler engine-builder: build buildings to get abilities to get points (and build more buildings). Not mind-blowing by any means, but a nice choice to take with you on a picnic or to carry in your pocket for a day out.

A good game for the price and what they've done with such a small package. If you're just looking for a super light, cheap, worker placement game, this fits the bill.

However, on its own merits just as a game, it was pretty ho hum, and nothing really exciting or novel is going on. Just very straight forward and bland worker placment. A game I'd play if someone else wanted to, or if for some reason I needed to cram a game into 15 minutes (which I don't really need, as almost all my game playing is on designated game nights), but not something I'm itching to play more of.

Kickstarted.

Participated in the testing of the solo rules. Plays exceptionally well as a solo and 2P, but haven't tried it with more. Games are quick, usually 10 minutes, and exciting. It's a race, so you're doing everything you can to amass mints so you can buy properties for victory points. 

The only "complaint", as it were, is that in a 2P version, the 7 points for victory happen almost one turn too quickly. As my wife noted, she's just starting to get "the good cards" up and running and then it's over. We've adapted house rules for 2P only with 10 VP is the goal. This allows for one or two more turns at most, but gives the satisfaction of finally using that expensive "good" card. 

That said, this is a solid, well-designed game. It's even more enjoyable having seen it grow out of the 2015 Mint Tin Challenge into a full-bore, successful Kickstarter campaign. Even as a PnP, this is a go-to filler for us and one that we've enjoyed introducing to others.

RATING: 9.5
Minimalistic game. It is awesome how good the game is considering it fits into 9x6x2 cm "mint" tin. This is the most effective simplified worker placement game I have seen so far. I would say it is the best gateway worker placement game - ideal for learning new (non gaming) people to play.
It is not a big game with pretty board and components, it's purpose is to stay in your pocket to be ready when you have spare 10 minutes to play.

What I like:
- this is the best pocket game I have seen so far. You can take it everywhere, play time varies between 5-15 minutes depending to the player count.
- game mechanics are clear, elegant and very easy to grasp. This is my new best gateway game to introduce board games to the new people.
- Visual part of the game is very good. Mint tokens look like real mints, starting player token is also pretty. Cards are manufactured with the great quality, the artwork is minimalistic but very functional. 
- Although the best gaming experience is with 3 (or 4) players, there is also very interesting solo game introducing four clever AI characters (some of them are very tough to beat). 

What I dislike:
- Because everything must fit in a tiny box, there is no room for sleeves. I decided not to sleeve this game, but as I am true sleever, I am not very comfortable playing unsleeved cards. Also I don't think there is a room for future expansion (maybe after tossing rule book or increase the size of the box)
- my minor gripe is to put all mints back into the tin after the game. as there is on place for any kind of bag, you have to put them all individually. yeah, i don´t have any bigger complaints :)
- because there is "only" 21 building types, the game can be a bit repetitive after bigger number of games played in a row. Again, this is understandable as this game is not meant to be deep experience. This is not meant to be a game for regular play, but to bring it out in special occasions (little time for longer game, traveling etc.) - NOTE: after cca 150 games played, I am still far from being tired from this, so repetitiveness is maybe not there much)
- there is potentially a bigger luck element, also starting position is quite important (in 3 and 4 player games). I don't mind either as the games are so quick and casual, that if you lost badly one because of the bad luck or because you start last, you never suffer for a long time and you can always play another one.

WOW! I was blown away at this little pocket game. For fitting inside a container the size of an Altoids box, this game offers interesting decisions, is quick, and lots of fun. It's difficult to rate a game like this, because if I am to rate it alongside my favorite full-sized games, this one doesn't quite compete. However, this game was designed to be a "pull out and play a quick round while waiting for your food" kind of game, which I think executes flawlessly. For that reason, I give it an 8. For a pocket-sized game you can literally carry with you anywhere, I cannot recommend this game highly enough. Plays excellent at all player counts, and is easy to teach!

I loved the idea of having a really portable modern boardgame.
When someone asks what the hobby is like I can take this out of the pocket and just play instead of explaining.
Neat theme as well.
This is a really easy to learn/teach game and it is very light both in weight and gameplay!
Great kickstarter game.

Fantastic little game, surprisingly deep for such a small footprint. We have played for several hours now and it is very well balanced, with the stronger cards having a high investment that can cripple your production if bought at the wrong time, and the weaker cards often synergising cleverly together. No 2 games played the same, and we were often within a point of eachother when the game ended.

Backed through Kickstarter and I couldn't fault the developer, they delivered a high quality game several months early. My only small criticism is in the physical design, as the instruction booklet and player aid are slightly too big to easily get in and out of the tin, causing some wear and tear to their corners.

Overall, a strong recommendation.

RATING: 7
Very solid micro-game in the worker placement genre.   It almost has the dirty art deco look of Fallout.  Wish it went just a little further in that direction.   Don't really understand the mint theme at all, apart from the packaging.   The game is minimal, fast, competitive, and it achieves everything that it aims to, as far as I can tell.  My only concern is that games will feel very samey quite quickly, even with a couple of the action spaces swapping out.

RATING: 5
I can appreciate micro games (though the sheer glut of them lately is a bit much), but they never have enough depth to take them beyond novelty. Mint Works, does work, and the packaging could not of been better, but the experience is fairly flat. Some of the long term combo cards never really get going since the game stops before they can develop, causing winning strategies to be largely the same, pushing one to just grab the highest scoring cards when they are dealt.

Regardless, it delivers a decent game in brilliant packaging, and for the price, I wouldn't begrudge anyone from buying it.

2017-03-08: Really nice small footprint game.
Feels a lot like a 'real' worker placement but of course not as convoluted and with very simple mechanics/point-conversion.
Sorely lacks variation though. Would be great otherwise!

Initial rating = 7 (very, VERY close to an 8 but would need more variation in setup/buildings to achieve that)

For a 'microgame' this is surprisingly very good.  You wouldn't think there is much here, but it does work well as a super short worker placement game.

It works better at smaller player counts, 1-3.  At 4, we ran out of mints fairly early due to the Crowdfunder being in play.  In addition, with 4 it felt like there should be more game than there is.

The order of the plan cards coming out changes how each game will play out and you need to jump on those card combos when they become available.

The AI mode works very well, and the 4 different AI players all work very well and are sufficiently different.

Only complaint is that the tin is about a millimeter or so too small, so I did the recommendation of trimming the rule book and reference card corners and then everything fit in well.

Jópofa, szépen kivitelezett kis filler, amiben azért nagy újdonság nincs. Nekem talán jobban tetszene, ha egy icipicit hosszabb lenne, és jobban ki tudna bontakozni, talán túlzásnak érzem a 3+ pontos kártyákat úgy, hogy szumma hetet kell csak összegyűjteni. De persze értem a logikát, hogy ez egy extrém rövid játék akar lenni, de így nekem kicsit kevéske., ahhoz képest, mint ami lehetne benne a mechanikák alapján.

Components: good quality on a small box. Rules and player aid too big for the box
Complex: easy to learn and teach
Weight: light, could be medium
Players: 1 to 3
Length: less than 20 mins
Mechanics: workers placement, what do you expect?
Decisions: where place to put my workers, should I expend more, which plan to get....
Opinion: great game in a small box, you can take it with you to everywhere. In a Mint box you have an excellent game.
You have to build the city, for doing so you have some workers that should be placed in some of the places available. Each space require different number of workers, and you have to plan wisely where to put them. What it is important to know is that workers placed are not recovered by the end of the round. And a round lasts while all players do something.
This is really a fast game with enough depth to keep you in during the 20 minutes a game can last, and have enough interaction and things to do.
What you can do... earn more workers (remember that workers used are lost at the end of the round), get a plan to be built later, build that plan.... and get 7 points or more to win the game.
It seems that it has become a game that will be with me wherever I go. As already said, with a length of less than 20 mins, and an explanation of 5, and with the size of the box you have an amazing game

This is perfect for what it is, which is a game you want to play when waiting around for other people, when sitting at a restaurant table waiting for your food, or for when you are bored in a hotel room and want something to play solo that is easy to transport. It's not a brain burner, although there are some interesting decisions to make. It's a good game that I'm glad to own, but I will rarely suggest pulling off the shelf except in certain situations.

This is one of those games which is the perfect length. It ends quite early and leaves you wishing it lasted a turn or two longer. That's a good thing. This plays decently solo, although it's not one of my favourites. However, it's a winner with my 11 year old daughter as a 2-player game. As a short, engaging game which doesn't take 10 or 15 minutes to set up and shuffle (this takes about 1 minute to set up!), it quite literally does what it says on the tin. I'm glad I backed this.

A few recommended tweaks: added a few tiddlywinks to the game to represent 5 mints; they often run out and there isn't much room in the tin for more.  Also I used a round corner punch to knock out the corners of the rulebook/plan summary sheet so they would fit better in the tin.

Compact game that comes in a container that looks like a container of Altoid-type mints. The pieces look like mints. They're workers/money that you place to claim and build buildings as well as generating more money and performing other actions that might come out during the game. Buildings give you powers and/or points. As soon as someone has 7 points, the one with the most points wins. Fillerish, but fun.

Played it once. I have a feeling we didn't start that good. I was the 4th player and the first round everyone took the "produce mints" card. I took the buy a building. It was the start so I din' thought on the first player. Player 1 took this one again so the next round everyone took the "produce mints" option again. Due to that the only only option for me was taking the first player cards. 3 rounds with almost nothing gave me such a big disadvantage that the game was already lost for me. Next time I will try to play it with the "produce mints" for 2-3 players although we lay with 4.
Nice little game to start the evening

For what it is, a super light worker placement you can fit in your pocket its fantastic. It's easy to setup, explain and get playing quickly, its fun and the components are fantastic. Games sometimes feel too fast as playing only to 7 doesn't really allow for much build up of your "city" and there is no real late game because it ends early. But this is resolved with a few house rules, mainly just playing to a higher score total and decreasing the value of multiplicative scoring cards. That said, when playing with new players the low score goal allows for playing a few games quickly to learn, and a game ending really quickly makes it less scary and you don't get so punished for a game losing move in a sense because the game ends soon after and you can move on to the next one! Haven't tried the single player so cant comment on that.

Most of the time the game comes down to 1 money you need to buy the plan that fits all your needs and blocking your opponents efficiently. Great game that plays in 10 minutes. Recommend it as a quick game to play outside or waiting for the meal at a restaurant.

Neat little (and I do mean LITTLE) worker placement game. I think it would be hard to manage a deeper game in such a small tin, but I do feel like Mint Works doesn't offer a ton of variety in your choices. I would like to see another mint-tin-sized expansion for the game, just to offer more cards, mints, and choices.

That said, Mint Works reminds me of the Great Heartland Hauling Company in terms of design elegance and compact design. Well done!

- The game seems to lack meaningful decisions. In a 2 player game, player order seems to determine what cards you get and hence wins you the game. Playing Mint Works with more players might change my opinion so the game is still in my want to play list.

{Loc: NO} Amazing mini implementation of a worker placement game. It's easy and simple to teach, its footprint is minimal and it's fun to play. Its playtime is too short for my liking though, I would like to see a longer version of it as rounds of this tend to be over in 5 to 10 minutes.

A nice little worker placement game that literally fits in a mint tin.
Although it plays quickly and works well it just feels slightly unsatisfying; I know, I'm hard man the please!
The Lotto action can win or lose the game, but I can live with that too; we houserule that it's first to a slightly bigger number of points to reduce the luck element.
Can carry it in virtually any bag or pocket, so it's a winner for pub nights.

Kickstarter (12$! Must have) & PnP (this review is based on the PnP version) 

Super fast (ca. 13 minutes) & super fun worker placement. 

Perfect Game for traveling &  "to go"  situations. 
A game we (me + fiancée) have been waiting for!

Also testing the solitary variant which works fantastic!

It is as short as advertised and the limited number of spots means that determining which action to do in what order is fairly important (as well as blocking off other people), but it feels kind of soulless due to how samey the buildings are (set collection, mint income, and/or points), I don't like the randomness of the lottery space, and I am really worried about replayability. Sure there are different action spots available each game and the order of the plans will change, but I think the general feel of try to get more mints either through spots/buildings that give you more mints, and then convert to trying to building buildings that give you a lot of points will still feel really similar from game to game.

EDIT: Not a huge change in feeling from game to game, but different enough that I bumped it up a rating. Also, the different puzzles for the different solo AIs and how changing one action can really affect them has allowed for me to play the solo mode over 20 times now.

EDIT 2: Back down to a 5. It feels like you do the same thing the start of each game, and topdecking seems too luckbased. It seems like the game half the time boils fown to  whoever has first player before the last round, as they can then choose whichever of the newly revealed cards gets the most points. Also, I found out some of the "advanced" actions were really not thought out solo, as in bad enough that I later found out the designer had errata'd to say not to play with them for solo.

(3/17) 6. A perfectly decent worker placement game that would definitely, definitely suffer if it weren't so incredibly tiny and incredibly quick.

This is the tiniest worker placement game I have played to date and it works well. It works as an introductory game to worker placement, as a game you can bring with you practically anywhere and as a filler. But its limited scope does mean it becomes an afterthought in my collection. Good for an occasional game, but not likely to be my first choice in anything.

Extremely portable.  Fast and fairly simple.  Some depth, but also some luck and not as many meaningful decisions as I would like, even considering its size.  Maybe a good choice for a light travel game or intro game, but probably won't be played otherwise.

I'm completely in love with this game. Backed it on kickstarter. Received it just a few weeks ago and have played it easily more than a dozen times. A very smart worker placement and engine building game but it's so very easy to learn and teach too. Very low barrier to entry but has some good depth to it. A perfect 2 player game and it doesn't take long to play. It's a staple in my purse now. Have played it on trains, on planes and when lazying around in bed on the weekend. If Five24Labs ever comes with a bigger more content version of it, I'll get it in a heartbeat. Highly recommended both for gamers and those who are new to the hobby.

A game in a mint tin! On the surface the game plays quickly and is fun. Underneath though there are some issues which arise particularly with the 4 player game where the first player has a distinct advantage. You can get the first player marker BUT at that time you don't know which cards will be revealed to buy - so it's a big gamble.
It works far better as a two or three player game.

Really awesome little game!
Easy to learn and play, everytime a great challenge.
Outstanding replayability, we play nearly everyday at lunch since one year and never got bored!
The best upgrade it could get is a 5 - 6 players update.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A great little filler game. You can teach it in a couple of minutes and it's a great way of introducing the worker placement mechanic to a less dedicated gamer. It could do with a little expansion to add more variety to the action spaces and a few more buildings and in rare situations, it's possible for the mints to run out with 4 players. But this is great to have around in a pinch and you can take it almost anywhere in its tiny tin.

PS. Use a rounded corner cutter to avoid scrunching up the corners of the rulebook.

"Tiny worker placement game. It is a very clever, minimalist design that packs a lot of game into a tiny box. I like its depth and replayability, but dislike blocking worker placement, and with 3p there is too much kingmaking."

What I like:
- Love the tiny package with high-quality components
- There appear to be multiple paths to victory
- Gameplay is smooth, and seems easy to teach and learn
- 4 different solo AI opponents are included
- Plays very quickly (2p learning games 10-15 minutes)

What I don't like:
- It is somewhat more cutthroat than I would prefer
- The rulebook is tiny--small print is barely legible in dim light
- I don't find the solo mode compelling, but it was good to learn the game
- The rules fit snugly in the tin (yay!) but require some effort and potential damage to remove (boo!)

I think this will appeal to people who enjoy Sail to India, although the mechanisms are quite different. I think I'll always play with Temp Agency to loosen up the board. I doubt I'll include Crowdfunder with 3p or 4p, as it feels king-makey. Recycler and Swap Meet feel pretty useless so far. 

At 2p, this is an 8 for me. At 3p, it's a 6. 

I have mostly lost interest in worker placement, but for $10 and with the tiny box, I had to get this. I'm very impressed that the kickstarter delivered 3 months *early*.

RATING: 5.5
Based on one play: You play your tokens on cards that let you take buildings or build them and then based on those buildings you create a little engine that gives you more tokens to play and points. It is really simple, maybe too simple as there is not much going on and few options when playing. Turn order also determines what you get to play on as spaces are limited. Cute box and components but game play is a little too basic for me.

What a fun little filler. This is worker placement stripped to the bone. But we play to  12. Playing to 7 is so short that only one player gets to achieve part of their strategy. Playing to 10 gives a little bit of back & forth - playing to 12 seems to be the outer edge where both players get some skin in the game. Playing to more than 15 seems to break the game because it's possible to build an engine that swamps the resources. It's a small game that is oversimplified and overpowered specifically to be a drag-race where things happen fast and one player dives across the finish line first.

I liked this worker placement game. A decent amount of game in such a small package and duration. I feel like you can get blocked so quickly, and it's very hard to catch back up if you ever go completely broke. Gaining cards that get you income is a significant benefit and it really sucks if your opponents take them before you ever have a chance.

Only played solo on Tabletopia.  The game ends at 7 stars!?  Too short to build any kind of engine and you don't see enough plans to really be able to customize what engine you want to build.  If the deed plans don't come out, the deed actions are pointless, reducing your options further.  I also simply don't like the idea of "worker placement" where you generate more workers mid-round.  Yes, it's micro, but you spend more time moving mints around than actually making interesting choices.

This is a light, pure worker placement game that is very good to teach people the mechanic and for a "quick hit" game, say, over lunch at the office or something. However, if you're looking for a deep, crunchy game with lots of strategy, look elsewhere. The choices are mostly obvious, but the game is so short that who cares?

RATING: N/A
Played once - 24 Feb 2017

A worker-placement game that fits in the backpocket of my jeans. A pluspoint even before it hits the table.

Set-up:
Played this for the first time with my fiancee after lunch in the restaurant. The 'game board' consists of 9 cards plus a deck of cards. Some space is also required for your neighbourhood, which is essentially your tableau. You won't have a problem playing this at most restaurants, bars, coffee shops. Unless, it's a tiny table.

Game Mechanics:
What can I say? Worker placement is a tried and tested mechanic, beloved by many, myself included. The game starts with four worker placement spots up for grabs and can be expanded up to 6 spots over the course of the game. The game provides strategical choices with the purchase of deed cards that can be subsequently built into your neighbourhood. These buildings in your tableau provide both ongoing effects and end-game scoring points (first to 7 stars triggers the end-game). There are 3 deeds up for grabs each turn, and you are constantly tweaking your tactics by assessing what's available.

Experience: 
I went for the obvious choice of obtaining buildings that gave me better income over time. While I was patiently building up my engine, my fiancee proceeded to get a few seemingly disparate choices of building. Needless to say, I was rather confident of my chances of winning. However, in the last few rounds, my fiancee managed to pull together a coherent strategy of combo-ing buildings that gave more stars for other buildings of the same kind. I lost, but it was a close and tense fight. 7 - 6 was the final score. 

We had to go after a round, but I can't wait to table this again at perhaps another restaurant/coffee shop table. Eager to see what other combos and strategies would be viable for this short yet tight worker placement game.

Interesting filler for the small group (2 to 3 players) that plays in 20 minutes. 
Mint works is designed as a light simulation of worker placement games. As such I bought it for solo play, hoping to get light version of Loyang and similar games. Unfortunately, solo AIs are unbalanced and they are not properly playtested so they have problems with some cards - it seems that mathematics for solo version was not done right. Intellectual challenge that solo game of this kind should offer is just under the desired border. This is a game that needed just a little bit more polish to be really good, but unfortunately it missed this goal. Still, it's worth having it as a filler.

Fantastic little portable game. It's kind of an elemental, almost "pure" worker placement game; your workers are also your main resource, and you spend/place them to buy and build buildings in pursuit of victory points.

It's great as an icebreaker/opener, and simple enough to use to introduce non-hobby gamers to worker placement ideas, but it's also complex enough to be a genuinely interesting game for a core gamer. This is one of the games I keep in my portable-gaming box to bring anywhere that I suspect I might get to play a board game.

Although this game gets the attention for its small package, I think what sells me even more is how SHORT the game is. It really is a 10 minute game. This will allow me to still get in a game on evenings where the wife and I are busy and wouldn't have time otherwise. Being able to take it and play on a small bar table, for example, just makes it that much more valuable. The game itself is a basic but well-balanced worker placement engine builder. I like the point cut off at 7--it helps keep the game very short, it prevents the engine from going into overdrive (something I also like about Agricola), and it ensures that some plan cards don't ever make it out into play, which helps it a variable experience. Speaking of variability, there are 4 optional locations which can be added in. I wish there were maybe 4 more than that, really that would be my only request. Adding in 4 solo AIs was brilliant; it reminded me of Fleet's AIs. They might be a bit easy--I am 4-0 against them, just barely beating Mort on the last one. Time will tell. Have not played with more than 2, would be fun!

Definitely the smallest game (literally) I have ever played.  It is nice it doesn't take up much shelf space and can be played immediately, a decent amount of depth too for such a small simple game.  Perhaps the only thing that prevents it from achieving a 9 for me is that I feel like they intentionally miniaturized this game as a selling/gimmick point.  Some things don't even fit in the tin properly and are hard to get in and out of the tin.

Great little worker placement. Easy to learn. The rulebook looks like it was designed to be much bigger and then shrunk. Shows the example setups, but they are too small to actually discern what they are in some cases. For two it ended almost too quickly, in only around 10 turns, making it around 5 minutes.

So glad I got to try this at GenCon 2016. Certainly this doesn't match up against a complex Euro-WP game for consuming an evening in strategic thought, but the rating is for what it is - a perfect quick game to start or end a game night, or to get in a full game experience with a small amount of down time (thanks to its portability). This is incredibly well distilled and the strategy for each round we tried was completely different based upon the starting plans. A worker action that seemed pointless in game 1, was crucial in game 2. Can't wait to get the kickstarter version in hand.

Pocket-sized worker placement game is what the box says, and that about sums it up. Not a lot of depth here and the turns are usually very predictable. Very little strategic options because every turn the optimal choice is pretty apparent. Useful for killing the time when you're on a train or an airplane or something, but this game is little more than a gimmick.

[I]tl;dr Paperback is truly a novel approach to deckbuilding, mashing up Dominion-style play with a word game.[/I]

[b]Read the full review [url=http://getonboard.games/2018/01/23/paperback-a-novel-approach-to-deckbuilding/]here[/url].[/b]

You are an aspiring writer…one who will stop at nothing to create the next best-seller! Welcome to Paperback, a light deck-builder cutely mashed up with a word game. Is this truly “A novel approach to deckbuilding” as the box claims?

Word gamers should love this game. It’s fun to draw your hand of cards, groan at your terrible options, and try somehow to scrape a good word out of a T, M, J, wild, and O. (Mote? Mojo? Tomb? The possibilities are endless). This is a fun and entertaining way to work your brain – if you’re a word nerd like myself, you will find yourself really relishing the challenge. 

But that’s not all you’re doing…many cards also have special powers, which activate if you can place the card at a certain place in the word, or next to another letter. These special powers are where the strategy of the game come into play. As you build words, you will be buying more cards, and these will shape which direction your strategy will grow.

Paperback was well-received by my game group, and I’ve ended up playing it about a dozen times with different groups. It’s an interesting theme to apply to a deckbuilder. However…It worked pretty decently as a very light word-building game, but that balance was disrupted whenever someone with knowledge of deck-builders came in and cleaned the crock of all the word-lovers. I would’ve loved to see a revision of this game, where harder/longer word creation was rewarded more highly.

Review based on single play. Paperback is a really unique deckbuilder. It feels like a much better, more enjoyable version of scrabble. However, one of the people in the group I was playing with was very AP-prone and well, it slowed the game down to the point that one of the players handed me the win just to end the game. I would play this game again, but I'd be careful about who I play it with. I don't recommend it for those who would feel too tempted to find the "best possible word." The game does have a mechanic that allows players, if they're stuck, to ask others for help. However, if there's no 'ideal' word, it's still very possible for the player to remain stuck. Also, due to the nature of this game as being  very dependent on people being good at coming up with words, it's just not playable with a lot of people. I think when it's releasted, Hardback, by incorporating more deckbuilding elements, might a address some of these issues.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Downtime is a problem. Dubious words are not dealt with by the rules (and looking up in a dictionary only prolongs things). Trying to find a long word (which is potentially obscure) is an integral part of most word-games; there is commonly a push-your-luck element. Not in this game.

There are many things which make a deck-builder satisfying, but I would suggest that one of the most significant factors is speed of play. Typically in deck builders turns are taken extremely quickly. This gives the game a satisfying pace which is unusual amongst other turn-based games. Paperback breaks this mould because so much thought is needed for each turn. This is the first deck-builder I've encountered which induces analysis paralysis!

Kickstarter designers should not cut corners on playtesting - it is essential! I'm sure a traditional publishing route would demand it. That said, Paperback is one of the better Kickstarter projects I have played and the concept is ingenious. I will enjoy the occasional game I'm sure. And I can always look lovingly at the beautiful box and artwork.

I only have a few plays in, so things may change. I like the concept here, but the issue I'm having so far is the duration. You can get stuck in a rut trying to get above 5 cards if you lack cards that provide an additional draw (and this can happen). That in turn slows the entire game down - unable to score above 7, unable to get longer words, etc. But anyhow, I like the challenge of it and it is quite different than other word games. So alright in several ways, but not a favorite.

THE GRAIN OF SALT: I generally don't like word games.

*****

A very light combo of Dominion and Quiddler, NOT Scrabble! As a deck-builder, it's extremely generic. What gives it life is the copy of Quiddler that's been attached to it; and it is a fair bit better than Quiddler, but far worse than Dominion. The themeing is absolutely pasted on; but I do love the paperback novels' flavour text!

I have no idea why people think this is such a great game.....

RATING: 8
"Dominion + Scrabble." I have yet to try this game out on anyone who didn't like it. Whether they are familiar with Dominion and/or Scrabble or not, they are intrigued by the idea of a deckbuilding word game, and even players who aren't extremely fond of word games enjoy it. While there can be a little bit of AP when you have a bunch of letters with bonuses and you're struggling to think of the perfect word that will use them all in the optimal order, it usually moves pretty quickly, and a good player can score well even without coming up with the killer word every time.

5/27/16 - Takes the place of Scrabble for me, any day. Just less intense and much more fun than any other word game I've ever played. Enjoy it immensely. 

11/11/15 - Came in the mail two days ago, broke it out last night and loved it. A fun and easy to understand and pick up game with a lot of replayability. If you like word games, this is an entirely new word game that will blow you out of the water. Was so impressed with it. My hat's off to Fowers for this gem. 

The designer was able to get another print run out, and looks like it will be the KS edition, too. Sounds excellent to me. Hopefully will find this in my mailbox sometime near the end of the month of October 2015. (10/9/15)

Word game + deck builder = interesting gaming experience. 
The rules are simple. You deck build to get more cards into your hand in order to make words worth more points to be able to buy more cards. Even has a good coop mode. Just be warned that AP players will start to get bogged down in later rounds as they try to form the best words possible. Only played it 2-player but have to believe there would be quite a bit of down time with more players especially if those players are AP prone. But that could just give you more time to come up with a better word as well.

Truth be told, I actually ignored this on kickstarter... I thought it was another gimmicky deck-builder where they try to force the mechanism in every genre. But this game is really good.

If I had to describe Paperback in one word, I would say it is impressive. It highlights a designer/publisher that understands word games, deck building games, and the component quality that gamers like. As far as word games go, the game allows for a great deal of creativity. Much of this creativity stems from the deck-building combinations that we all grown to love (Adding cards, changing value of cards, replacing cards, etc). But furthermore, the game doesn't slow down like dominion can with too many estate cards and/or curse cards; simply put, the use of fame cards (VP = wilds) is genius and always give you a decision to make. And the component quality... wow; everything is sleevable, the box holds sleeved cards perfectly, and the box has a small footprint on your shelf.

Overall, I was really impressed with this game. If I had to nitpick, I would say the game is very AP-prone. Now, personally, I find AP almost a prerequisite to a great game and find the issue of AP largely the result of a slow player. But like dominion, you draw your hand at the end of your turn... which means you are always engaged in the game.

Excellent game. Very brain-burning feel. I absolutely suck at this game but love to play it.

This is a mixture of Scrabble and Dominion. Who likes deckbuildung games and word-puzzling will like this game too. It is easy to learn and the special abilities in the cards are interesting. Disadvantage that you need a relative big space for playing (e.g. we usually play it on the carpet).

This game is an excellent gateway game, combining deck-building (only known to people in the hobby), and word games (familiar to nearly everyone outside the hobby). There are multiple ways to enhance the game offered in the rulebook, but even the baseline rule set offers a solid play experience. Being driven almost entirely by theme, I'm not going to be staying up nights excited about my next session of Paperback, but it's a game with great utility in any collection, and I can play it with "normies" without wanting to smash my head through the table.

Initial Impression: Perhaps it was too late in the evening and we were all tired, but I wasn't as impressed with Paperback as I had hoped I would be. I understand that merely printing cards with letters on them is, by nature, uninspiring but I found the presentation to be a bit drab overall. The gameplay was casual and I felt almost no tension. This would be a good game for gateway gamers and those who really love word games. I think my preference would still be to play BuyWord as my go-to word game but I can see the appeal of this one. To be perfectly honest, I think I need to play it again to form a better opinion.

If you grew up liking Scrabble, but would rather play a game with modern mechanisms, this is a good to great game. The number of variants out of the box is well worth the price and it simply works as a deck builder. Like other Fowers games, the rule book could be organized better (it's good to learn the game from an initial read, but not good to reference rules as you play). One of my issues is that the end game can drag on if one of the players doesn't want to grab a particular book and/or can't draw the right combination of cards.

I don't like this game for two reasons. One, I am not a fan of word games. I know that's unfair and if that's the case I shouldn't have bought it. The second reason is that I really like deck builders but this one is not a very well designed deck builder, in my opinion.

I like a deck builder to give me some control over my hand and to not make it impossible to cull unless I happen to find a card I can afford that will do the job and draw that card at the exact right moment. Paperback, for me, fails at both of these. At the end of your turn, you have to discard everything. This wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that my word game skill are so bad that I often end up discarding most of my hand of good cards, unused. This makes if very hard and extremely luck driven to pull off the good combos I have built my deck to do. And, the culling is also very difficult and timing sensitive.

Overall, if you don't like word games, a lot, don't buy Paperback. As a deck builder, it is mediocre at best. I will say that I have had people request it since my first play, but since I opt to sit out and just watch, it doesn't actually make it to the table.

Takes two mechanics I generally dislike (deck building and word games) and mashes them together. Eh. I can see why others would like this but just not for me. Also, the game is very susceptible to AP and there didn’t appear to be a great power arch to the game. While it became possible to make longer words later in the game, in practice it was difficult and often felt restrictive and just sucked some of the fun out.

Deck building meets word making in a splendid package. What I really like about Paperback is that each kind of player (word master or strategy gamer) each have a chance to win. I'm no wordsmith, but I can base a strategy around the available cards. Solo also works really well. One thing though, I would only ever play this with 2 (or solo) going forward as my game with 4 really dragged.

haha 69. 
if you like dominion and scrabble, then you'll probably like settlers of catan. you'll also probably like paperback.
It's literally dominion but your deck is letters. and you make words with the letters. like 'fuck' and 'piss' and 'planes'. although the game seems a little unrealistic. if writers got paid 5 cents for every 'g' they used in a novel, then we'd have a lot more writers.
it's a cleverly designed game, that is fun and quick. there's potential for profanity so keep that in mind for small children. is it worth it? again i dunno, i didn't buy it, stop asking me.

Basically, mix a card game with scrabble and this is what you get. Works as a solo game if you like that. Does take some table space, but not much.

This is a great travel game for two people or more if you have a small flat area to play on.

I really enjoy word games and Dominion.  This combines the two and I was, frankly, blown away by this.  I imagine once I get my own copy and play this more, my rating could go up.  Unlike Scrabble, you do not have to worry about board placement but because it is a deck builder, building an efficient deck is key.

Not as good as some other deck building games, like Dominion, but earns its keep with its Scrabble like feel.  Paperback allows deck building to mix into age groups it would normally not have gone as it works just fine with both old and young(teen) players.

The ending of the game seems to come abruptly sometimes.  There also seems to be a run-away leader problem if you truly care about who the winner is.

Despite being a mix of a deck builder and Scrabble, I am amazed at how easily almost anybody can find words among their drawn cards.

Unfair rating (in fact for me it's really a '2' as I'll never play this again) - based on the fact I loath word games (being dyslexic doesn't help) and rate Dominion a '3'

A game that is a cross between Dominion and Scrabble isn't going to be one I enjoy ... but I can see why others who like wordgames will love it.

[Oddly enough I like codenames, either I'm inconsistent or it's the spelling aspect that kills scrabble and similar word games for me, rather than the words bit]

RATING: 6.5
This game is based on Dominion, which I don't like very much. I was therefore surprised to find, when I played it with my family, that it is quite fun. It's simple and easy to play. It's a great choice when playing with people who enjoy classic word games (like Boggle or Scrabble) but don't have much experience with more complicated boardgaming. 

It has all the strategic fun of a deckbuilding game. Players must decide between cashing in quickly on cheap victory cards or trying to build a powerful engine that can consistently purchase the most expensive ones. In addition to these standard deckbuilding elements, it adds the really fun puzzle of finding the best possible words. I love this. It's exactly the element of engagement that I didn't find in Dominion.

So why only a 7 for Paperback? Because the game, while fun, is also very poorly balanced. Not only are certain cards grossly overpowered (the R that grants +3 cards next turn is a prime offender), but the whole design is just a bit off. There are tons of really expensive and exotic letters--X's, Z's, Q's, and the like--which you can theoretically add to your deck if you generate enough money. But no sane player would ever buy one of these expensive letters. They are incredibly underpowered and their presence in your deck will only make it impossible for you to form long words. I think the game balance needs to be substantially redone so people actually have an incentive to buy unusual letters. Were that done, I could really endorse this game. As is, it feels like the designers didn't quite understand their own game. It's a deckbuilding game in which good players will always ignore what should be the most interesting and fun cards. That's too bad.

Another issue is that the decision to make all victory cards serve as wild cards (good for any letter) makes word formation just a little bit too easy. I'm not sure what the best way around this is, because if wild cards were dead weight (as in Dominion), this game would become way too difficult. But a middle ground might be best. Maybe allow victory cards to count as wilds, but only allow players to use a maximum of 2 per turn.

A third balance issue is that the player who goes first has a significant competitive advantage. The designers should have included something to compensate for this.

My family tends to play this almost cooperatively, where we help each other out in spotting the best words. I recommend this mode, since Paperback is not really robust or balanced enough to make a real competitive game.

The more I play them, the more I realize I just don't like word games. This is probably one the best I've played, simply because unlike in games like Scrabble, you don't have to wait until your turn to plan your move. 

But I still always get frustrated when trying to come up with a word: I get crippled with AP working and reworking my letters to get a good word, then I start feeling guilty that I'm keeping the other players waiting, and then I get annoyed at myself for having picking a stupid, low-scoring word because I was so rushed. Since this basically describes every one of my turns in this and other word games, I can't give it a glowing recommendation. I still like this enough to play occasionally.

As word games go, this is among the very best. The bounty rule helps avoid the Scrabble issue of 15-minute turn lengths. It never feels very competitive, either, since players are each playing their own game (so to speak). This is a nice game to play over tea and crumpets.

CONS:
- The deck-building is not very deep.
- Some cards are definitely easier to generate profit with than others.

Based on 1 play with 4p and a partial demo game at 2p:

Demo'd this at PAX but only had time for a couple of hands and just bought it on the spot. I like deckbuilders, I like word games. Kind of a natural fit.

If you too are a part of the niche audience for this game you will probably like it. It's about as straightforward as deckbuilders get but the word element makes it unique and enjoyable. The community card aspect is a neat wrinkle in the deckbuilding formula, and asking for help in finding a word is a really nice addition to the word game genre (this is an optional rule, but there's no real reason not to use it).

The only thing I don't really like about this is that since it's a deckbuilder you often end up with the exact same hand as previous rounds, so people tend to end up spelling the exact same words on multiple rounds which is kind of lame. Not a big deal, but still lame.

In our second game of this (and first full game) we played without realizing it had so many expansions mixed in so we accidentally played with attack cards which all of us ended up disliking. It just felt like they slowed the game down without being a really interesting way of interacting. Will definitely mix these out again in the future.

Not a game-changer by any means, but all in all a solid title.

Quite literally the best word game I've played (and with a wife who's a big fan of word games, I've played quite a bit).  The deckbuilding aspect really makes this game.  It keeps it fast, and limits the analysis paralysis due to the number of wild cards and limited options (whereas with something like scrabble building words might be easy, but finding optimal placement definitely causes me to suffer from AP).

It's also the only word game I can play that I feel like I have an actual chance of beating my wife.  So it's got that going for it, which is nice.

Can be a bit of a brain-burner, and prone to AP if players aren't working out solutions on their own turns. On the other hand, it's an attractive, fun, well-themed game that attracts players who love word-based games but wouldn't normally enjoy deck-building.

RATING: 8
A challenging and fun card game.  The rules are easy enough to learn and teach.  The difficulty comes form the word building which is easy enough in the beginning, but if you get too greedy with buying more words without thinking about what you are going to do with them you can have some rough turns especially if the common card is a game mechanic and not a vowel.  It does take a great deal of work to get the higher letter count as you have to set your deck up with cards that increase your next hand size, cards with multiple letters, and/or some luck getting a workable hand. I do think setting a timer might be needed giving players 3-5 minutes on their turn plus the time of other players to make are word.

The one and only word game in my collection. I enjoy the deck building mechanic. Unfortunately, the deck building doesn't have much of a roll in the game.

Really not happy with this crappy barebones version of the PnP. 
I paid for PnP and got beta testing crap. 
No instructions for printing beyond total number of types of cards - which don't match anything on the cards themselves, eg. Fame cards have themes, and VP but no mention of Fame on them. 
Plus the rulebook talks about player powers and attack cards, which aren't in the PnP file at all. Way to screw up what seems to be an otherwise nice game.
Plus I'm forced to deal with this PnP version because I have tried multiple times to order a retail copy and can't due to between print runs, etc.

July 2017 - Got a retail copy. Production quality is not the best - cards have some bad cuts, the box shows light through the corners, and other imperfections in the cards. Seriously not impressed.

Superb word game that is unlike any other word game I have ever played.  Please note that you do *not* have to like deck building games to enjoy this game!  I played Dominion a few times and did not care for it -- to me it just seemed like a lot of pointless card shuffling.  However in Paperback, at least to me, it feels like there is much more of a point and strategy to building your deck.  This feels like deck building with a *purpose*.  If you enjoy word games, you *need* to try this game out!

You are a paperback author trying to finish novels for your editor. Complete Westerns, Science Fiction, Romance or even the rare Best-Seller. Live the dream — and maybe pay the bills.
Word-building meets deck-building in the unique game Paperback. Players start with a deck of letter cards and wild cards. Each hand they form words, and purchase more powerful letters based on how well their word scored. Most letters have abilities that activate when they are used in a word, such as drawing more cards or double letter score. Players buy wilds to gain victory points. Variant included for cooperative play.

My wife's favorite game right now (she's a Scrabble maven, so this is hardly surprising). Even when she helps me -- without the bonus points for doing so via the wooden cubes -- she kicks my butt by a wide margin. I enjoy the game because it's a Dominion clone and therefore feel like there are some gamey aspects to it, but I suspect I'll be able to count on one hand the number of wins I'll have over her when all is said and done.

Update: While this playing with my friends -- not my wife -- who are of equal ability when it comes to their vocabulary, this is has been a far more enjoyable game. And of course I'd think that; who likes getting soul-crushing defeated every time they play a particular game?

I'm not very good at word games, but the deck-building mechanism gives me a chance to win against people who are better at them.  It has gone over very well with everyone I've played it with so far.  I prefer to play in larger groups as there's a bit more time to think before it's your turn.

In a word game in my own language, Greek, I can beat almost anyone. Language is my passion and my job. Paperback wouldn't be that easy even if it was in my mother tongue. It's not a word game. It's mainly a deck builder and a damn unique one. Brilliant idea, brilliant excecution.

Really nice artwork and a unique concept: plays like a combination of Quiddler and Dominion. I'm not sure if it was just the one game I played though but it seemed slow and difficult to progress to high scoring words, which meant it got a little boring after a while. I might give it another go.

Fun little game that would have been easier if the common words were actual vowels.  The first two common cards were the reversal and spacebar,  which made our first game a bit more difficult. I suggest trying (at least your first game) without these two cards.  Didn't play with any of the 'expansions', but will probably include them minus the attack cards for the next game.  Took about 45min for a 2p game.

Great game. Compact, easy to learn. Each game is variable but there are some words and letter sets which players will maybe lean towards each time you play. I really like the CH combo and will grab it any time I can. Especially fun for those who like word type games and are not so interested in typical board games which for them tend to be "bored" games.

You're bound to enjoy this one if you like word games. However, there seems to be little incentive to purchase high-value letter cards when similarly priced fame (victory point) cards are available. The fame cards are wild, so, unlike the victory point cards in Dominion, these have some use other than just clogging up your hand.

One of the better "light" word games I've played, if you can parse the ropey rules and excuse the halfway-theming of the card art (the victory-point cards are novels, but they could only come up with a few fake novels - lame!).  Some of the variant rules just seem silly, and the 'attack' cards seem way overpowered.  I do recommend the variant where a 'theme' card establishes a chance to win bonus points for making words that you can argue relate to the theme.

You are a paperback author trying to finish novels for your editor. Complete Westerns, Science Fiction, Romance or even the rare Best-Seller. Live the dream — and maybe pay the bills.

Word-building meets deck-building in the unique game Paperback. Players start with a deck of letter cards and wild cards. Each hand they form words, and purchase more powerful letters based on how well their word scored. Most letters have abilities that activate when they are used in a word, such as drawing more cards or double letter score. Players buy wilds to gain victory points. Variant included for cooperative play.

An interesting, familiar feeling deck building game.  Players must make words from their hand of letter cards, and the letters used gives the player buying power to add more letters to their deck.  Sooner or later, that buying power will translate into Duchies, Provinces, and the like, devaluing the deck, but injecting victory points.  Very Dominion like, but the mental challenge of making words make it feel quite fresh.  Some of the cards are quite dull, and the lack of contrast make them difficult to read the special powers.  Still, fine game.

I don't particularly like word games, so my relatively low rating for this game reflects my tastes more than any problems with the game.   Paperback achieves its aim quite well, in fact.   I would say that perhaps it is too easy (and boring) to pursue wild card strategies, but that's not a proven fact, just a hunch.   The art for the victory point cards is very cool, but the letter art did not seem to go well with the look of the rest of the game.   Not a big deal.

This truly is Scrabble, the deck-building game. Turns are more interesting than Scrabble, because it is usually easier to make a word from your hand. The challenge is finding a word that makes best use of the special actions on the cards in your hand.

Uses the deck-building mechanism to obtain more cards with letters on them with hopes of obtaining more and more letters to make longer and longer words with the goal of buying “book” cards to obtain victory points.  I love the deck-building mechanic as its quick to teach new players and quickly get them into the game.  Dominion is one of my favorite games (I rate it a 10), but if there is any game out there that makes the deck-building mechanic look dry and boring, it is this game.  

Thus far, this is the ONLY game I’ve ever asked to be excused from during play: after about 20 minutes of this (and no end in sight), I had to jump tables to another game that was starting up.  The downtime between turns was excruciating as players stare at the letters on their cards and try to come up with a word that uses the most cards they have for the most amount of points.  This game is more prone to Analysis Paralysis than I have ever seen in any game.  A game of Dominion lasts 25 minutes on average (some real professionals can play it in under 10 minutes), but this game lists itself as a 45 minute game; most of that time is spent on players staring at their cards in silence.  

The game may be a deck-builder (which I love) in its most simplest form, but it is just so boring and unengaging and lasts WAY too long for what it is.   
(oh, and it has a very home-made/kickstarter’ish look to it, but that’s beside the point.)

If you like word games, you'll enjoy this.

I don't really like word games and thought it was okay.  I have a really hard time visualizing letter combinations, especially when I know one exists.  This game taxes my brain in an unrewarding way. 

Deckbuilding and spelling mesh together seemlessly though, and this game does a really good job of showcasing that.  

Even if you have a modest vocabulary, you can do well in this game, which I see as a strong plus as that's usually not the case with word games.

One of the most effective uses of the deckbuilding mechanic, as it really seems to flow in this game. Fires Scrabble a million times over. After playing this, I booted Trains out of my collection to make room, and I'm not looking back. And all the variants included in the rules make perfect sense and alter the game nicely. Wonderfully designed game, and in a compact box too! The only detractions are that people with better vocabularies will win most times if they play right, plus AP-prone players will slow the game to a crawl as they try to optimize their word choices. In other words, the people you play this with matter.

The perfect word game. AP is almost inherent to word games, but since each player is only working with their own letters, it goes so much faster than Scrabble/Upwords/etc. Lovely design, the deckbuilding aspect is nicely balanced, the book-publishing theme is thin, but appropriate to the art style and whimsically fun.

Paperback is a Dominion-esque deckbuilder where you play cards of letters (and letter combos) and make words on your turn. The cards you use to make a word each turn have a money value on them and can be used to purchase new cards that have letters with special abilities or letter combos (e.g., TE) or VP cards a la Provinces and Duchies. Every turn there's a common letter available to all players to use.

I liked it because I like word games, especially word jumbles (love Boggle), and it was fun to make my word puzzles each turn. There are bonuses for making the first 7,8,9,10 letter words and I didn’t get any of them (though I still won). However, I'm not sure about player counts for this one b/c it's easy to get locked up in AP as you try to create a word with ALL your letters and not settle for anything less. We played with 3P and any more seems like downtime would start to get annoying. Still, I'd happily play again.

First off - when Captain Analysis Paralysis decides to play, you NEED to house rule a timer. Doesn't seem to be a problem with most people...just a certain select few...keep one handy just in case. Play is simple - deck building via spelling words with the cards on hand. Person with most fame at end of the game wins. However, does play quite long due to sheer number of cards in each fame stack (you have to deplete a fame stack to end the game...but if you have other players intent on obtaining better playing cards before focussing on fame cards, it can take a while to deplete said stacks). Nice production, pretty cards. I enjoy word games, so also enjoyed this but it's too drawn out if you have players who take too long to play.

Paperback is both a word game and a deck-building game.  Usually the marriage of two different board game genres leaves a lot to be desired, but Paperback somehow manages to improve on both.

The frequency of wild cards make the game easier than Scrabble, but opens options to make longer, trickier words.  The mechanic broadens play for new players, while still leaving depth for experienced players.

The wilds also serve as victory points ("fame points" in game).  In some deck-building games out there the victory cards are dead draws.  In Paperback, while they don't give you any points toward buying new cards, they're still needed to fill in words and serve as vowels.

This game stands as the best I've bought all year.

Slightly disappointed.  I like the added complication of building a deck of letters that fit well together, but then there is not enough trashing in the game to really mold it into anything.  Unlike other deck builders it just seems more random, and if you want an efficient deck then prepare to spend many turns not buying anything or just buying one-use vowels.

It's a great game.  I like it a lot better than Scrabble and I think that has a lot to do with the fact that it is a deck-builder.  The game slowed down a bit for the boys as they really weren't in the "thinking" mood.  So spelling words for them became a real struggle.  At times, I was giving them words just to move the game along.

I like it quite a bit! More fun than similar deck builders (like Dominion) for sure.

A couple tentative negatives though:
(1) The cards are not very balanced. The +3 draw cards are insanely better than all other cards, for example. Several other cards are substantially better than others as well. This is particularly a problem in games with more than 2 players, where the cards available change constantly as many buys happen between your turns.
(2) Going first is a huge advantage. You get first crack at all the cards on the board. You also have a *much* better shot than anyone else at claiming the 7-letter and 8-letter common cards as you get the first turn with a realistic chance at each one. You also just get more turns than everyone else if the game ends on your turn. Huge, huge deal.
(3) People with analysis issues who get draw a rough hand can take forever. This game with 5 players takes quite a while.
(4) The low cost cards tend to be better letters than the high cost cards. As a result, no one buys the highest cost cards. Why spend 8-10 cents on a Q/Z/J when you can buy a wild or just spend 5 cents on an N that probably has a better ability anyways? In ~8 games I have only seen 2 purchases from the most expensive deck. Why have it at all? Several of the cards need to be re-priced into lower tiers (and several cards need to go into higher tiers, see (1))
(5) Some of the expansions are not fun. Both the dyslexic and space bar common cards were a flop in the games I tried introducing them. My group did not appreciate theme words either. Awards and Powers have more success for us

Dominion meets Scrabble. I like the concept and the art on the book titles. It's a charming game, a little fiddly to set up, and you're likely to run into AP issues with people trying to spell out the best word possible. The higher-cost letters seem, to me, overpriced and so unlikely to be used.

Update: The ratio of set-up time to game play time relegated this one to the for-sale rack.

An exciting hybrid of a word game (like Scrabble) and a strategic deck building game (like Star Realms).  It starts a little slowly, however, interest builds as the game progresses and longer and higher scoring words become possible.  The box and card designs are lovely.  Highly recommended for two players!

If you have friends in your gaming group prone to AP, stay away from this one. Turns could (and should) take about 10-20 seconds, but I've seen a single player spend about 10 minutes staring at their cards to find the best word to form.

Nice production values and the artwork is charming. The game itself meshes deck-building into a word game pretty well. If you like both of these types of mechanics, you might like this game. For us, the game dragged and didn't get more interesting as it progressed. I'd rather play Typo.

RATING: 8
This really is a fun, unique game, even though I don't generally enjoy word games. Plays quickly (except when someone gets stuck and can't make a satisfactory word).

The other word games I've played either rely too much on knowing obscure words and focusing more on board positioning (e.g., Scrabble), or are speed games (e.g., Bananagrams, Word on the Street). Since the fun part of any word game is seeing what cool words people make, this game avoids those pitfalls and hits the right spots for me.

RATING: 8
Excellent take on deck building. The way the points cards are wild is a really good twist to it: they don't help you buy new cards but at least they help you make words.
If you like Scrabble at least one bit, this is a really good pick.

I like the idea and I love deckbuilders, but it just wasn't that engaging. The actual word puzzle was very well done and interesting every turn, but that also meant that the turns took very long. It also ended too quickly with 2 players. Perhaps if it was in my mother tongue I wouldn't have to think that long during my turn. I will I try it with more people so there's more time between turns as well as possibly more turns, I think that might help it. I'm also anxious to try the cooperative mode!

I had played Dominion before and the basic underlying concept is the same. Build a deck by buying cards and occasionally trashing cards (as card rules permit) to build a lean, mean word building machine. Despite that I had a difficult go of it. Much more difficult than expected, but that's why I like it!

I'm not sure on the game because I haven't played enough of it yet, but the build quality of the box is impressive. It all fits in a small box and even includes separators for the cards, making a game that's really easy to setup and cleanup. The card quality is top notch and the whole thing feels like a premium experience.

It's ok.  The main thing it has going for it is that it's unlike any other game we own.  Scrabble + Dominion.  I don't like Scrabble, and I don't like Dominion, but this game is alright.  Several of the turns feel scripted and I find myself falling into the same words over and over again.  We added the Theme, Attack, Powers, Awards, Dyslexia and Spacebar.  We don't care for Attack or Spacebar that much.  Tried the cooperative game once.  Everything is ok.  Not my favorite game, but it fits a niche for 2 tired parents with little free time or energy who just want to sit and play something quick and simple together.

UPDATE: got rid of it.  every game felt the same.

Even though I don't know why, I always liked Scrabble and this one is just the next step. I'm unsure if the attack cards are necessary, but you can just sort them out, so...

I got the feeling that they just add even more luck to the game, not being able to form the word you had in mine, just because some jerk played a fitting attack card.

Just keep in mind that there will be some downtime. The more options you get, the more downtime.

Paperback is a clever step back from the typical 'thematic' deckbuilder (Fantasy/SciFi/Comic Book, etc) to cross the deckbuilding mechanic with the word-building mechanics of Scrabble/Boggle/Prolix.

The play is simple: draw a hand, make the best word you can, buy cards/victory points, discard and draw.

The theme here is that longer words tend to score more money, and can buy either better cards, or wild cards which add victory points but otherwise don't add buying power, or special effects.

Like most deckbuilders, you have to know when you want the shiny card that improves your deck, or to go for the points- but in this game you have to be able to come up with the words first.

I liked this game even with the 'plain jane' PNP cards, and it got better with the added art, better card quality, storage box, and variants.

I rate the PNP a 7.25, on first play I'll rate the full set a 7.5.

This is one of the best deckbuilders I've played; instead instead of painting on a theme it added meaning behind the mechanic, and only added theme after that.

Bravo- well done!

The best way to describe this game is "Scrabble: the Deckbuilding Game".  I am not usually a big fan of most word games (like Scrabble), primarily because the people I play with tend to either take way too long trying to come up with a word, or try to invent/guess words until they can find a combination of letters that is actually a word in the dictionary.  However, because there are more "wild" letters in this game, it is generally easier for everyone to come up with words.  Plus, you get the added strategy associated with the deckbuilding side of the game and the effects/powers on the cards.

Dominion meets Scrabble.

Interesting idea, though it seems that if you do not obtain/use letters that let you draw additional cards, you'll have a harder time. Like trying to scale a cliff hard time compared to the person who is able to obtain/use such cards. The rule modification to when a red card (the cheap vowels) are used, instead of being removed permanently from the game, they are put back in the bottom of the supply pile is nice.

We've always played with the optional rule of being able to help other players and scoring a "coin token" if our suggestion is ultimately used. It helps move the game along and players tend to be more interested in being THE person to come up with a cool word than being concerned about how it is also helping the opponent (so win-win in our group).

Being a word game fan I thought I would love this game, but the minimal player to player interaction killed it for me. The only time we seemed to talk to each other was to remind someone their turn was taking too long or correct a counting mistake. It would seem like there would be enough downtime for some light conversation, but if you are trying to win you just focus on your hand during the downtime to plan your next move. I also am not a huge fan of deck building games where the end is triggered by running out of certain stacks. They play out too predictably, at least in most of the groups I've played them with. I would still play it again - that's a no brainer if you're a fan of word games - but I'm not going to be beating down the door to get a copy.

I did really love how the action cards present a real advantage, preventing people who are losing/not good at word games from just becoming complacent.

While I really like deck building, word games just aren't as appealing for me. The emphasis of paper back is to create longer and longer words as the game goes on. Personally I found it quite hard to do which lead to the game stagnating as you continually make words that just aren't quite long enough. Perhaps more of a flaw with me than the game.

This is a good gateway game to help get people into board games. If someone likes dominion and/or scrabble that will likely enjoy this game. There are a lot of variants to the game (a few too many for my liking). Some of the powers that can be played with are a bit too over powered so we opt out of the "power" variant and refuse to even attempt the "attack" variant. Other than that, the bounty is a great way to include younger ones or people who struggle with words.

Smartly designed card drafter that suffers from the same issue that Scrabble does: long delays while others at the table fashion a word from the letters in their hands. More strategic and enjoyable than Scrabble but its fun may be contingent on the other players at the table.

This is one of the most interesting word games I've played. I'm not a big fan of Scrabble or Dominion, but this game's just got something special. The cute art/theme is definitely helping.

Analysis paralysis is certainly an issue. This is not a game I would play very competitively, nor one I would bring out on game night when everyone tends to rush through each game hoping to get two more in afterward. Nah, this is an open-a-bottle-of-wine-and-play-a-leisurely-game kind of thing. I don't worry so much about making the best word, and I just make conversation when someone else does. 

Update: And I don't normally play solo games, but I tried the rules for this one and it was pretty fun. (I lost :-)

Very impressed by my first play of Paperback! The distribution of wilds & common letters at the beginning makes words come easy. There's a great satisfaction that comes from playing a killer combo of cards in later rounds to score max points and/or bonuses. It played a tad long for our full table of five, but there were first-time jitters to get over as well. You wouldn't need to twist my arm at all to get me to try it again.

Paperback is the first deckbuilding game that has really impressed me and justified its place on the shelf alongside Dominion. It helps that the primary focus isn't on building one's deck but the actual word creation part of the game. It also makes the game accessible to non-gamers who might be turned off of the strategic nature of Dominion.

I don't like Scrabble much, but this game is brilliant.  There's lots of strategy in how you build your deck and some very interesting combos in the special powers.  And the game is through the distribution of the wild goal cards.  Put in a bunch of the low value ones and you'll have more time to go for the high-value combos and big scoring words.  There's more to this game than first appears.

This game is really a good game. If you like deck builders and love words its a no brainer. But I feel like it is a gamers game. The times I have played it I have always had hiccups with people thinking to much like scrabble and not enough about the deck building....making it take way to long.  There are plenty of deck builders that i could show people and they would understand, but because this is words people focus on and not think about the other game...Now if they know deck builders already and know about thinning decks and spending through there deck to reshuffle then this game is really awesome!   I love the concept though, just can't get to play it much.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (December 2014)

As usual, I didn’t know anything about the game before I bought it, so I was pleasantly surprised to see I enjoyed Paperback. Sadly I had some personal issues while playing so I was on the phone a lot of the time. Due to this I didn’t enjoy the game at its fullest but I’m keen on playing it again.

Paperback is a mix of Scrabble (a game I don’t enjoy) with Dominion (a game I love) and the end result seems to be very good. My main worry is that it seems the game can be hard to play in Spanish as we don’t have some letters (TH) and we have  different letters (LL, Ñ, CH). Also the game was very long with 4 players and had lots of downtime , I think that it is best with 2 players (as most deckbuilding games). With AP prone people, the game can take ages to finish.

Bottom line, I want to play again soon, perhaps I will need to get a Spanish version of the game. It is very novel. Fun theme for me.

As I thought the game has lots of downtime but it isn’t as big of a deal because everyone is thinking about his own word, still I find the game to be very long. 

Love the cube variant in which you ask for help to other players :D.

I suck at this game. but I think I will print the Spanish edition so I can play with my friends. I, also keen on trying it in English to see what happens.

This is Dominion and Scrabble's love child. It would make both of its parents proud too. Both competitive and cooperative forms of the game are great and there are a bunch of tiny expandable cards that are nice to play with in the base game.

Best part, if you spell horribly (like I do), you can still do well and have fun. Plus, you get to work on your vocabulary!

RATING: 8
Word-based deck builder in which you use the letter cards to make words and then, based on the card values, buy more cards -- or the wild cards that, when two piles are depleted, end the game and determine a winner based on the stars the cards have accumulated. It's not much different from other deck builders, but the word-building is a different challenge than just point accumulation, and I love the fact that some letter cards are hard to use (CH, NT) while others reward you for using them all.

PLUS: a nice twist on the deck builder
MINUS: not for those who hate spelling (or see some of the group as more literate than others)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Yay, one of the few decbuilders that does not suck!! Also one of the few where just buying the most expensive card isnt allways the best strategy. Very multiplayer solitaire though, but if you play to have fun and help eachother with the words it is an easy going good time. (Kickstarted)

2015-05-21: Initial rating as 7, but it really feels like somewhere between 7 and 8. I've played Dominion (and Scrabble) before, so I was familiar with the Deck-building mechanics. Having played Dominion and Star Realms really helped jumping right in on this and and game play seemed really smooth and simple. I played with a friend's Granddaughter (2-player game) and we only played a light round, but she picked up on it right away and was a fun challenge.

Word games are hard to design and usually pale in comparison to Scrabble (and maybe Boggle, but word search is not my thing). Few games get the balance correct of rare and common letters and provide enough flexibility in word-building. Palabra is a game I like that is able to get around this problem by allowing you to play non-word poker-like combos or matching colors. Paperback gets around it by turning victory point cards into wilds. Point cards help you to create words, but are worth nothing when buying more cards to add to your deck. This is the key design element that makes Paperback an exceptional game in the genre.

The game play is pretty much like any other deck-builder. You draw five. You use your cards to make words. You purchase letter or victory point cards based on the values on the letters you used in your word. Many cards have actions associated to them that changes the value of your word, allow you to draw more cards your next turn, or attacks your opponent, limiting them in some way on their turn. There is one common card - usually a vowel - that both players can use to help them. The common card can be claimed for points if a large enough word is created. There are 4 victory point values that can be purchased at different price points. Once two of the victory point piles are depleted or all four of the common cards have been claimed, the game ends. Victory point cards in your deck are added up. The game plays great with two players. Even though I love word games, there were only two that I had found worth keeping. Now there is a third!

Best word game out there. All options, solo, co-op and competitive, are good fun. However, early stages can get a little dull and draggy as you build up your deck of letters, hence leading to alot of repeated words and letters.

RATING: 7
A lot of fun, and casual enough of a word game that gamers and word game players can play together and have a good time, but the excessive amount of wild letters in each deck can lead to some turns where your word actually doesn't matter, and spelling Theater or The give you the same amount of points.

This is an excellent game of making words out of letters. The deck building concept works well and adds an interesting contrast to typical word games.

Now that I've played a few times, my verdict on this game is positive. I prefer it to Scrabble any day. While it rewards for vocabulary, it doesn't take itself nearly as seriously. There are no single game breakers here, either, as the triple word can ruin a game of scrabble. You can't set some one up here; you make your own decisions. I greatly prefer that to scrabble. My biggest problem with the game is that since you have the same letters in your deck, many times you will see the same words by the same people. Aside from that, this is a solid Dominion: Scrabble edition. Wonderful art and theme on the wild cards. Other letters are solely functional.

I think the theme is very unique, and the idea of combining a deckbuilder with a word game is novel and fun (in theory). When playing, I feel a little too constrained by my cards, so it seems like there is little control or room for skill. But I'd be happy to be proven wrong, which can most likely be done with more plays.

For 3-5 players, I recommend the simultaneous variant by Dave Campbell, which is included in the 2nd edition rulebook.  Here it is, somewhat rewritten by me:  [The rulebook unnecessarily says to remove attack cards, and does not say to remove unbought cards from the market.]
Paperback Simultaneous Play Variant:
1. Setup: Remove the few cards that say "trash cards from the market", and shuffle all the rest of the market cards (of all prices) together.  
2. Start the game by laying out 10 cards (replacing any cards 8 cents or higher) and then having each player draft 2 cards out of it (in horseshoe forward-then-back order).  (This makes the game get going faster, allows you to "aim for something" with your deck right from the start, and means players start with a 12 card deck (to match the six card hands).  
3. Base hand size is 6 rather than 5.  
4. Before each turn, deal 10 cards face-up to form the market (cards for purchase).  
5. Simultaneous play:  All players draw their cards for the next turn without looking at them until everyone's ready, then someone says "go" and everyone looks at their hand and races to announce their word for the round.  Remember the order in which players announced their words.  
6. Once all players have announced, players buy in the order they announced.  The market does not replenish between players' purchases, so late announcers have fewer purchase choices.  
7. If you choose to buy the common vowel, you do not take possession of it until the end of the turn, so it may still be legally used in following players' words, and buying the last common vowel doesn't end the game until all players have had their turn to purchase.  
8. If you discover that the word you announced is impossible or illegal, then you may re-announce a different word but you go to the end of the buying order, even after players who have not announced yet.  
9. After all players have had their turn to purchase, discard the unbought cards in the market, and deal 10 new cards for next turn's market.

A deck-building word game.  You slowly build your deck and make words to earn money to buy more cards.  Very simple gameplay.  Some of the cards give special bonuses or have special powers depending on how you use them, so that adds a nice flare to a word game.  Definitely seems to be something of a Scrabble-killer.  Probably deserves more attention than I think it has gotten.  That is likely because you can only buy this directly from the creator.  Worth hunting down.  Excellent game.

What a fantastic word game. I feel like this game plays better with larger groups because of the AP issue. With more people you have more time between turns to come up with a word. With 2 players, your turn could come back to you too quickly. A timer might be worth introducing if people take too long to come up with a word. Want to try the co-op version.

07-28-2015 - I hate deck builders (which may or may not be 100% true), but I really enjoy this one.  The wordsmithing element really adds a fun goal to the game, it's not just making your deck "better" than everyone else and hoping you're able to score more points in the end.  You do have to choose good letters (so in that regard it is about having a "better deck" I suppose), but it comes down to the words you can create, not hoping to get "6 attack" or "8 gold" or whatever.  Lots of fun elements to this one.  8 which might be low.

Word-building meets deck-building in the unique game Paperback. Players start with a deck of letter cards and wild cards. Each hand they form words, and purchase more powerful letters based on how well their word scored. Most letters have abilities that activate when then are used in a word, such as drawing more cards or double letter score. Players buy wilds to gain victory points. Variant included for cooperative play.

One comparison I've seen is Dominion mixed with Quiddler.  That is probably pretty close to what occurs in this interesting game. 

Paperback is an excellent mix of a spelling game and a deckbuilder.  Spelling longer words potentially grant extra points and more vowels, but doesn't guarentee victory.  There is quite a bit of Dominion type of cards involved in the game.  Certain cards grant special abilities if the letter is involved in the word being spelled.

Back during the CCG craze of 1994 my friends and I joked about "Scrabble: the CCG". I'm pleased to see that it's finally become a reality. Paperback is a deckbuilding word game, and it's very well done. The gameplay is interesting, it commits to its theme and design, and the artwork is charming. Unfortunately, it suffers the same problems as Scrabble. You have to have exactly the right players for it, and those are few. There's also a lot of downtime while another player figures out the best word they can make with the letters they have. It's rough with two players and I can't imagine how it is with four or five. (The other caveat that comes with word games, which is a subpoint of "right players" is, be careful of knowing words that aren't "real everyday words" as nothing kills such a game faster than discovering you're playing with THAT kind of whiner.)

RATING: 5
Interesting idea with the high point scoring cards allowing you easier access to create words but also starving you of money to buy other scoring cards, forcing you to get the expensive letters, and there also seems to be 2 different strategies of getting a lot of double letters/easy to use letters in order to make the 7+ letter words or just doing a normal ramping up for money strategy, while you don't necessarily want to buy all the VP cards at the end cause they make it easier to make new words. However, even with a guy with an English degree playing too, generating enough money in one turn to buy out 2 of the VP stacks seemed very difficult and made the game drag for quite a bit. Also, while if there were stagnant stacks to buy cards from I might buy a certain attack card just cause it messes with the leader's strategy especially, that often I was buying attack cards regardless of the attack cause it still generated ample money only to find out later it screwed over an opponent by locking down e.g. all of their expensive 8+ cards made it seem like just a random beat down rather than something strategic. Finally as the game goes by the greater prevalence of infrequent letters along with potentially larger hand sizes are ingredients for AP.

Nice game, feels like a deckbuilder that is a bit different, game doesn't look overly exciting, although it plays well. Can be some non-turns in this game and there isn't as much scrapping as I would like, some of the player powers also aren't great, enjoyable as a 2 player and a CO-OP, probably wouldn't play with more people due to the possible AP it provides. Like the attack cards, wouldn't play without them, have backed Hardback and the expansion for this (80 new cards), is a nice game to play occasionally.

Scrabble meets Dominion.  I really enjoy this game.  It is not recommended to put the "attack" cards in with noobs, and after trying it and turning off said noobs, I think this is a good piece of advice.  I strongly recommend playing with the cubes that allow you to help opponents for a future penny, otherwise the AP can kill the game.  Interesting concept and unique so far as I have seen.  Definitely not for everyone.

This is a perfect mix of word game and strategy game.

I don't really enjoy Scrabble because it descends into people making silly 2/3 letter words (that I've certainly never heard of ;]) for a bazillion points.

This game actually encourages you to make longer and more complex words. But it doesn't punish the less lexically able of us - providing plenty of wild cards to keep the options open.

A brilliant combination of two fantastic genres, deckbuilding and word games. While you can mechanically see a lot of similarities to dominion in the deckbuilding and victory conditions, the game itself feels very different. The word game aspect of Paperback is hard enough as it is, and the duration attack cards add another layer that makes the game's puzzle all the more challenging. 

I haven't tried out any of the variants and advanced modules / cards that come inside the same tiny base game box, but I'm excited to see how they spice up the game.

RATING: 7
Solid game with enough flexibility and variation that you don't need to be a master word game player to succeed.   Game gets a little tricky towards the end with coming up with enough money to spend to buy cards as the "offer" of cards dwindles.  Also, it feels like you need couple of plays under your belt to really get a sense of what cards and powers are valuable.  Not sure this is going to attract people who are averse to Scrabble, but it's a great alternative that's a good mash up of word and deck-building games.  Another plus is that because words are restricted to what you're holding, you have a nice chunk of time to think of your word.  This should (most of the time) allow you to play your way right away when it's your turn - helps to keep the game moving along.

I'm not a huge fan of Scrabble. (We only ever play Scrabble when my husband requests it.) Because I'm not a Scrabble fan, I had my doubts about this game. 

I did end up liking it a lot more than Scrabble for two reasons. First, it's a deck-builder, and adding deck-building to anything will almost always make me like it better. Second, some of the cards had special powers that could influence the kind of words you could make. I now wish I'd gotten the specialty tiles for Scrabble that were on Kickstarter a while ago. They might have made me like traditional Scrabble more.

Sin duda este es el mejor juego de palabras que conozco. Me gusta que sirve igual de bien en inglés que en español, además de los poderes de las letras y que te pone a pensar para crear tu palabra. La modalidad cooperativa es muy difícil y aún no hemos logrado vencerla. 

El setup me parece un poco largo porque hay que barajar todas las cartas del mercado.

Great Word Game! My wife & I are adding variants as we play.  We have played the Co-op variant together once. She really likes that. Both of us really like this for a word game.  The game can get long for us, so we have shortened it by having less fame cards to draw from & if 2 stacks of letters are used up that also ends the game.  I have also played one solo game and enjoy the challenge.

Really cool idea of mixing deck-building with a word game, but the zero interaction between players and the inability to carry cards between hands (especially when English words rely so heavily on combos) killed it for me. There's the option to add attack cards, but I'm not necessarily interested in attacking others in a game like this, just affecting them in some way.

Scrabble meets Dominion for an excellent experience. Physical version have more modes of play, but it is easier to visualize words in the app. 

'+X cards next turn' seems to be a combo too powerful, and decks cannot easily be thinned, but that does not detract from the satisfaction you feel when you score a 10-letter word or pull off a score of 30+.

The interesting concept of combining deck builder and word game, and quality components make for a decent experience. However, would personally prefer a better scraping mechanism. The lack of one means purchased letters take a long time to come back, which is fine in most deck-building game, but in this game it means using similar, if not same, words over and over again. A little bit of a bummer that.

I really want to like this game a lot.  I love the visual design, I love how it uses the familiar deck-building mechanic in a cool new way, and I love the decision of what to buy - higher points vs. cool abilities vs. more versatile letters to use.  But, I get so hung up in word games, trying so hard to make the perfect word.  I hate that my turns take so long and I'm making everyone wait because I have all the cards I need to do X and I just need to come up with the right arrangement to make it happen.  Sadly, this is same reason I refuse to play Scrabble anymore.  I'll still keep playing this because it does something really well, but I have to force myself to rush my turns and make less than optimal plays to keep the game moving, which doesn't feel great.

Got it for my wife, I watched a bunch of playthroughs. Just got it in the mail and played 2 solo matches. First one was fun but way too easy, I won and didn't need to think much at all. I played again and used a rule I found where every cube increases the cost of the card by one, I won but I had to think of every card I bought, utilize as many cards and powers I even had to think of how to distribute cubes and pulled off a win just barely. Quite a few turns I didn't buy any cards. This is the only way to play solo. 

Can't wait to play with the wife and hopefully a 3 player with my bros.

This is the game that combines Dominion and Scrabble in such a way that if you dislike one of those two individual games you might actually still enjoy this one. I'm someone who enjoy the word crafting mechanisms of Scrabble, though the board tends to bog down in that game. I was not a fan of Dominion and was pretty turned off deckbuilding as a genre before trying this game.

Here you have piles of letters you may buy, each pile are divided by cost and contain a variety of letters, some combined letters, some with special powers. But in order to buy anything you must craft a word from the cards you hold, the cards used determines how much purchase power you hold. This brings a skill to the generic draw hand of a deckbuilder, which for me improves on the mechanism. And the fact that the draw piles aren't made up of identical cards makes the game feel more dynamic to me. Lastly the game has a plethora of little additions you can throw in, like player powers, theme cards, goal cards, mechanisms that allow for co-op for those who likes that, take-that abilities if you like that, and even for players to help opponents for a reward.

I definitely think it works better with fewer players as it becomes a longer game the more players you add. Recommended.

This feels like it could have used a bit more development.  The ending for us is always abrupt in the 4th or 5th word by emptying the fame piles.  Usually the 2nd high value word triggers the end game and winner.  It could just be me where this type of deck builder (like Dominion) isn't my type of game.

Accessibly with potentially broad appeal.  Delightful art.  Mix of word game and deck-building game feels natural, but the deck-building portion is shallow.

[microbadge=1714]

[u]23-Jan-2016[/u]:  This is basically a mashup of Dominion and a word game. You start with a small, weak deck of cards. You play cards, buy cards, and repeat. The twist is that you are forming words with the cards you play. Growing up, I used to play a lot of word games, things like cryptograms, fill-ins, and whatnot. I also played a lot of Boggle as well, so word games are already interesting to me. Combine that with my most owned, and enjoyed, game mechanism, and you should have a easy win in my book. 

That's mostly true here. The basic gameplay is just that...basic. There is really nothing new and interesting here beyond the fact that you're creating words. That's fun, but only for so long. This game, for me at least, plays on the longer side...60 minutes on average. I would have really loved for it to be in that 30-40 minute range, similar to Friday. But I've also started playing with the included "modules" to help spice things up a bit. These add some much needed, interesting mechanisms to keep the solo player engaged beyond, "What word should I make this turn?"

Overall, I enjoy the game. It's straight up deckbuilding with a word game layered on top. The components are very nice. The card quality is very good. The graphic design is pleasing, which is definitely needed for a word game. And the artwork on the Fame cards is great. The extra modules included help make the gameplay more interesting. It goes a little long for the level of complexity provided, but it's still a fun time for those who enjoy word games.

This is one of those games that is quite polarizing in opinions as most word games are.  If you enjoy scrabble, boggle, word on the street, etc then this game is for you.  The dominion like deck building works well.  Its a bit long with 4 players for me.  I'm not a word game fan but the other three we played with enjoyed it because they like the vocab genre.  This game hurts my brain more then heavy euro's.  Still a good game for the right audience.

I really like this Dominion/Scrabble combo.  Now, if you don't like word games you aren't going to like this.  And, it's likely that if you play with someone really good at word games, you are going to get crushed, even if you are good at deck-builders.

After ten plays, I'm sad to say this hasn't been as wonderful as I'd hoped, but it's still a fun little word puzzler. It presents a fresh angle on the classic spelling game (Scrabble, Quiddler), essentially using deckbuilding as its method of variation. Everyone probably spells "TR**LS" or some variation thereof for the first couple turns, but you'll soon be presented with some gnarly spelling challenges. I can attest that the better speller usually wins.

While I'd choose Paperback over Scrabble any day, the game takes too long relative to alternatives like Quiddler without offering a whole lot more. Deckbuilding doesn't really present viable alternative strategies; I can say from experience that there aren't enough trashers reliably available to build a "Chapel deck" (to use Dominion parlance), and other approaches seem as unlikely to come together. I also have to agree that the Fame Cards don't slow you down very much relative to the other cards. Yes, getting a hand full of wild cards is a wasted turn, but so is the hand filled with the likes of P, CH, and X. Of course, you want to find a balance, which in the end feels more like guesswork than strategy. That's fine for a word game, as it keeps the focus on spelling, but then I'm left wondering why bother with the guesswork at all? Just give me a hand of random letters and let me see what I can do: thus Quiddler stays in our collection, while Paperback will be finding a new home.

Paperback takes the standard deck building format and adds scrabble, and works much better than it should, in fact it is one of my favourite games.

The game is a tight package including multiple ways to play, and mini expansions included in the box.

You all start with the same basic hand of cards that includes wilds and five letters. You draw five cards and use those and a common card to build the best word possible which allows you to buy better letter choices or wild cards which give victory points. Most victory points wins! 

Simple but well done. Highly recommended for fans of Deck Builders and/or word games.

My opinion is probably swayed a little as my wife loves this game!

I bought it as a 'kind-of' present for her. She loves word games and I'm pretty good with my 'wording' also. I just don't enjoy Scrabble/Boggle/Crosswords (3 she really likes) as they have too many inane 2 letter words being used. This game combines my favourite mechanic (Deck-Building) with her 'wording' love.

Great fun, very tactical, nice engine building, a little bit of 'not so mean' meanness and to top it all off, being good with words give you a slight advantage, but you can be very successful even with a poor vocabulary.

2-5 Players competitive or co-op. Have only played 2P competitive so far. We play with variant that if you can't make a word (for example, a hand with no vowels and no vowel in the common track) that you discard entire hand and get one cube. I also like the "bounty" variant in which you get  reward for helping another player. I like this better than Scrabble, as it's more "tricksy," but I can understand some people might like a "cleaner" game.

Combines the best aspects of Scrabble and Dominion into a single system. It's a little rough around the edges, but Paperback is a solid design.

Dominion meets a wild-heavy Bananagrams. For even casual word freaks (you know, the ones who have the ARSINE, RETAIN, SENIOR, and SATINE anamonics memorized), this game is way too easy, given that RSTLN and 5 wilds counts as a starting deck. A hard mode with fewer wilds and more difficult letters would be welcome.

An excellent word game - and a unique concept of word game meets deck-builder.

Apart from how well the game works mechanistically, this is the first word game I've played that has a built-in mechanic for asking for help from others at the table. Too many word games suffer when one or more players have trouble coming up with words quickly, and this is the first one I've seen that has a rule for throwing it out to the table and rewarding another player for providing a word to use. 

Not a lot of expansion options for the future of the game (other than one or two new cards off to the side), but letters with diacritical marks would at least allow for playing the game in a few other languages.

Cross Dominion with Scrabble ... and you get a lesser version of each. It's slower than Dominion (which is a downside as Dominion's pace is one of its primary selling points) due to the need to analyse your hand of 5 cards (which contain letters or letter combos) to form the best scoring words. The higher you score, the better scoring card you can buy (Dominion-style) to add to your deck, and if the bought card has a bonus effect on it for each time its played, even better. When you start scoring really high words, then start buying VP cards - these double-up as wild card letters and are an obvious improvement on being useless hand fillers. I wasn't a fan of the slow pace, nor the unspoken pressure to give in and accept a lower score just to keep the game moving. As a result, it's not a game I'll seek out, but it was at least an interesting design tangent to explore.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A very creative take on word games; There are features built into the game that keep it from getting cut throat.  I don't mind cut-throat games sometimes, but it's not appealing to me with word games.  For example, doing poorly at Scrabble makes you feel like you don't have a good vocabulary.  That's not the kind of thing I feel good being competitive about.  I'd like a word game to be less of that kind of tension, but still have some depth, and planning.  Anyway, one of those cool features is bounties.  It gives people incentive to help others. Another feature is the deck-building mechanism.  Your words don't directly score you victory points (fame).  But they give you money to buy letters, which have special abilities.  This helps move the game along, mitigating analysis paralysis.  If you can't make a big word, no problem - you can make a smaller word and benefit from a card that will give you a better set up for your next turn.  You can pull off some nice combos ala Dominion.  So there is less pressure on you to produce a big word with letters you don't like  - a problem many have with Scrabble.

"Deck Management/word game. Pretty much what you would expect EXCEPT that all the wilds and special powers make it very different from Scrabble or Boggle. Some turns can take quite a while to figure out your best possible word. Co-op mode is a nice option."

What I like:
- Excellent take on deck management
- Co-op mode included in the rules (which is also soloable)
- Focuses on easier words than something like Scrabble
- Attack cards can be omitted without problems
- Excellent card quality; excellent dividers

What I don't like:
- Can play slower/longer than would be ideal
- Odd box shape (it's small and cute, but tricky to store/transport)
- Vowels seem to be in short supply
- Might be nice to have more trashing opportunities

I have only played solo so far. My learning game took 90 minutes. As others have said, it is best played casually, to keep the pace up, and because there are no rules about challenging questionable words.

A nice twist to deck-builders, using word building. I'm not big fan of games like Scrabble and Bananagrams, but this one clicked for me and I'd play it anytime. Being able to buy your letters to add to your deck with some of them having special abilities is a big plus. 

Updating this after trying the co-op rules. I enjoy the game even more and think I prefer playing this one co-op, as it's quite challenging...even when you help your teammates out.

interesting game.. lots of potential.. quickly created two new rules:

1) all players simultaneously play their cards, making their words; when all are ready, take turns cashing in and buying;  attack cards apply against next round.. speeds up the game a lot;

2) you have to give some victory point value to the letter cards ..  maybe 1 point for every x cents in value or something like that... otherwise, there is no reason to ever buy those cards when you can buy the victory points cards and quickly end the game.

1 play - a strong word building/ deck building game. It's essentially scrabble, except that you are drafting the letters into a deck (as opposed to picking randomly from a supply). Scoring works similar to Dominion, where instead of purchasing letters (cards) from the market to add to your deck, you buy 'books' (cards) from the VP market, which serve to clog up your deck - creating the same Dominion tension of, when do I start adding VP cards to my deck?

Many people say you can like this game if you like EITHER deckbuilding or word building, but I would argue despite a love for deck building, you probably still need to enjoy creating words to fully enjoy the experience.

Paperback is a combination of the games Dominion and Quiddler.  It's a deckbuilding game where you draw a hand of letter cards and try to make the best word possible, with rarer letters being worth more money.  That money is then used to buy new letter cards (a variety of which are available for purchase) or VP cards that count as wild but don't give you any money when used.  Some cards have special text that can increase the money you get or hurt other people's turns.  The game takes a little longer than it looks, as people go through permutations to come up with the best word.  I think it's one of the more entertaining word games out there, though.

As a fan of word games and deck-builders, Paperback was something I’d been looking forward to trying. Sadly, I was pretty disappointed. In this game, players draft cards into their decks. Cards have a letter or pair of letters on them which provide money to the player when they’re played out of hand to create a word. Money is used to buy more cards and to buy victory point cards which do nothing but clog up a deck. Perhaps our circumstances were less than ideal, but the game took way too long. There were 5 of us and there were attack cards in play, but 2 hours!?! It really soured me on the game. I’m willing to go back and give it another shot with 2-3 players and see if that improves my opinion, but this session was enough for me to remove Paperback from my wishlist.

A mixture of Scrabble and Dominion, where you are trying to compose words on your tableau using letter and double-letter cards you purchase from the "letter market". Like Dominion, the key is having a balanced deck and knowing when to shift from buying letters (which allow you to form better words and get more money but give you no points) to buying novel cards which get you points but no money. Very entertaining. Wish there was a Portuguese version of this.

it was late and we were tired. Seemed a little slow but we will give this another chance. It was fun to create the words but I'm not sure I like the end game. all one needs to do is buy all the 5 star cards and then they are very close to winning... need another play to verify if this is the case.

One I had been wanting to play and, while it was enjoyable enough - and quick, like most deck builders - one player just kept making the same word over and over and walked away with the win. I always wonder whether word games should favour word-power over gamer-power and I don’t know that the balance felt right here.

Best word game ever?

RATING: 7.5
A fairly inspired twist on the familiar deckbuilding genre..."what if Daddy Dominion and Momma Scrabble had a baby?"  Well, they'd name it "Paperback."  And there's a word I'd use to describe it, but it is escaping me right now...
The art deserves some special attention, as the wild cards are beautifully illustrated to replicate the pulp magazines of the early 20th century.  
The game itself...is exactly what you'd expect.  You draw and make words with the letters in your hand, and you buy new cards to add to your deck.  The special powers on the individual cards vary from useful to the point of almost being game-breaking (draw a free 6 cent card?!?) to the painfully useless (Attack cards, which punish other players, in particular seem unnecessary).
Now, does my expectation of the game diminish the fun?  Not really.  I do enjoy it.  The powers require a little more planning, and I've yet to imagine a way the game could end with the "common cards," but the first play through was pleasant, and I'd like to play it again.  
Leisurely.  That's the word I'm looking for. This game would be best enjoyed at a languid pace on a rainy Sunday.  Take your time, make your words, maximize your score and let your friends do the same.  Then, honestly, who cares who wins? 
I guess this game takes more after its mother.

Paperback takes the brilliant idea of Dominion-style deckbuilding crossed with Scrabble-style wordbuilding and runs with it. I don't think it's perfectly executed but the basic concept is so fun (for word game fans) that it scarcely matters. I really liked that (unlike Scrabble) it incentivises long words and memorising 2-letter nonsense words is pointless.

RATING: 8
Word games are not my favourite, but this one is quite nice. Have so far only played solo, where AP doesn't matter so much, but can imagine that it could drag out multiplayer when more than one person is trying to figure out what word to spell next. Or perhaps that's just because I'm so bad at this kind of game. Still looking forward to trying it two-player with my word-game-loving partner.

Everyone says it's when Domionion meets Scrabble. I think the game is designed pretty well and took a great stance on deckbuilding. The theme is friendly for non-gamers. I just didn't think I would ever play this over Dominion. Also, the box was a weird size and shape, which made it hard to store.

Scrabble meets Dominion. A game where you draw cards, build words, and earn ducats to buy more letters, in hopes of getting the money you need to buy the books you need to earn VP.

Overall it sorta just feels like a very simple deck-building game only given some chrome by requiring you to build words. If you like scrabble and deck-builders you'll find this really engaging, but honestly, as someone who has played a fair share of deck-builders, that portion of the game is pretty uninspiring, and the scrabble portion isn't very exciting either. It gives me a vibe that makes me think of MMORPGs and casual games, where your reward for playing well is that you can play well in the future easier. Which isn't really anything. Not bad, but I don't think I'd play it again.

The best way to describe this game is "Scrabble Dominion," and it fits very well. I especially enjoy that my printing (I think the second edition? I don't actually know) came with some variant play materials in the box.

As a warning, as with any other word-making game, the actual gameplay will vary significantly based on the people you play with. If someone is throwing out words like "apropos" or "ponce" on a whim, the game will get much more difficult to do well in.

Scrabble meets Dominion, as many have said. The one snag is that there *can* be some difficulty in acceleration of powers, so a game that is clearly over may drag for multiple turns until someone is able to buy up the last Common Card, or final Fame card. Can also understand other comments that have been made re: relative player skill. Definitely favor those familiar w/ deck builders & strong linguists vs. other game players.

A fresh take on deck builders, mixing a word game in with the traditional deck builder mechanics. Combo letters, the fame cards, and more give players a decent amount to think about. Variants and optional cards are included that can add complexity to the game if desired which is a nice little bonus. Plays up to five players but is best with two or three. A good alternative to the traditional word games as well as deck builders.

This one definitely needs more plays to fully appreciate. We haven't played with attack cards (which should really be called self-attack cards), theme cards, special powers, or awards yet. Also haven't played coop yet, which I think will be ok yet perhaps not. In the competitive game, each player was focusing on their own hand. We didnt run into too much AP which was nice. The thing missing from our plays so far was tension. There just wasn't a feel of tension. Which is why I think coop might be more exciting? Anyways, more plays needed.

Interesting concept but I'm not sure it hit the mark for me.  I'm not a big word game person but I can enjoy a game of scrabble.  this game seemed for frustrating than fun.  There are just some cards like "nt"  and "ng" that are cheap but seem to clog the deck rather than help.  I haven't found a strategic angle yet to this game yet but I have hope that it exists.  Overall, at this time just okay for me and falls a little short of other more modern word games like Word Tycoon or Buyword.

Very excited to have a good word game that I enjoy playing. It's been a while since I had grown out of pretty much all of the others at this point. Looking for more, so if you have any suggestions, let me know. I really enjoy that this is a deck builder (a favorite mechanic of my wife and I). I love learning new words or coming up with a great word based on the letters I've drawn. It can be a little analysis paralysis prone if you let it. They do have a variant to get help to help with that. A must have game for people that like word games.

Very good game.  There are a couple of cards that are very overpowered compared to others (e.g. "R; take 3 extra cards next turn") but otherwise it's well balanced.  Great combination of a card game and a deck-builder, which isn't just reliant on being able to come up with clever words.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
deck building + word forming mashed together in a way that actually works.  Clever!

A few cards are overpowered if bought early (and only one person will get the chance to do so), but overall pretty well balanced.

update:  It seems that you should just about always buy victory cards when able.  As your deck grows, the extra wilds (even providing no income) are worth it, and often scores are fairly low and the low VP cards are quite efficient. That slightly reduces the strategic possibilities for the game.

i'm tired of deckbuilders, but this is still my favorite word game. i really like the strategy of buying cards for abilities, grabbing up double-letter cards, or going for the expensive wilds. this game is quite accessible to gateway gamers and is low on the chaos. i do find the "draw more next time" cards are a little extra powerful and therefore get snatched up when they're (randomly) revealed which sometimes leads to (random) imbalance in power. still, the game is short enough that it's forgivable. well, i say it's short. actually, there could be some serious AP for finding the right words if not everyone is taking this as a light game. to avoid that  you could always add an egg timer and then use the "incentive cube" variant (where opponents can offer you help in exchange for 1 cent discount later). the fact that the game comes prepackaged with variants (expansions, really) is another huge selling point that i didn't know about until i opened the box. a great, great game.

It's a completely straightforward mashup of Dominion and Scrabble.  We've played a few times, though, and it's falling flat as far as the narrative of play.  There's an early-game rush, as you buy a few letters, then easily make the 7- and 8-letter common words and exhaust the lowest pile of wild cards.  Then things sort of bog down as making longer words and scores gets a lot harder, and folks slowly grind out the next pile of wilds or manage to get lucky with +draw cards and double letters to exhaust the common cards.  The end feels really anticlimactic, unlike the obvious comparison of Dominion, where once people get their deck engines up and running, they quickly deplete the victory piles in a tense rush.  It just feels like the tension is up front and then the game outstays its welcome.  It's not bad, but it's not particularly good, either.  The artwork is nice, on the cards that have some.

Great mixture of a word game and a deckbuilder. As a pure deckbuilder it's actually pretty good mechanically, certainly one of the better ones. The word game AP problem is reduced by VP cards doubling as zero point value wild letters. So if you get a hand full of victory points you can still play something.

P&P, + backed it on Kickstarter for the European level - timed my contribution just so to take it over the 35k threshold (last stretch goal) :D.

After two plays, once with 2, once with 3, we've found it a bit too long. I agree with another commenter that the end conditions may have to be tweaked a little to avoid a drawn out game. Two empty piles of VP cards may be a bit much - we stopped after one pile was gone. 
However, the second 3 player game was also played in German while using the English cards, which may have contributed to the long playtime.

I don't think much changed between the print and play given to kickstarter backers and this final version, but it suddenly flows much better and goes much quicker.

A cross between Dominion and Scrabble that works rather well. You have some control over the letter deck you're building and what injects a dash of extra interest is that many cards have an additional ability when used in a word during a round. There are no dead scoring cards here either. So because there's a lot more thinking involved it plays at about the same pace as Scrabble, except I'd say that some turns are quite quick because you're rarely saving any special letters for future rounds. With four players we rarely have a turn where anyone is waiting more than 30 seconds because (except for a few attack cards), the game is rather a solo affair and most times you have prepared your word while others are having their turn.

I enjoyed it, but my wife says she would only want to play it with some people. Not for everyone, but I'd rather play this over dry old Scrabble with its board positioning any day. What it loses in board interaction it more than makes up for in ditching the Scrabble winning two and three letter word knowledge advantage. You can play it as cutthroat as you like - we let the kids look up a few words in the dictionary because that way it's educational for them. Only in one game have we felt the need to bring out the Codenames timer to push each other along, because usually there's been plenty of time to think out of your turn anyway. Certain slow players I wouldn't play with, but that goes for Scrabble too.

A really clever game which makes clever people feel even cleverer.  Unfortunately....for me it just over stays its welcome.  I don't quite feel the "power arch" from Dominion, and every time I've played, I've hit a point where I ponder "how can I end this game faster".

It's a great idea, I play it once in a while, but I think it's just not for me.

My wife doesn't enjoy too many games, but does seem to like word games.  I showed her the video for Paperback while the game was on Kickstarter and she expressed interest, so I backed the project.  The game arrived recently and I have had several plays with two different groups now:

Basic game, 4-players (gamers), Attack cards included - The game starts out fine, but as more players acquire Attack cards, the game really starts to drag.  When the first couple of Common Letters and 5-cost Fame Cards are gone combined with several Attack cards in play, the game can pretty much stall out. The game can only progress if players are able to spell long and/or high-value words and that becomes nearly impossible due to the Attack cards.  As a result, several rounds can go by with players just passing and that's not good.  The Attack cards may be okay with just two players, but given that there really isn't an engine to build and there isn't a great way to thin your deck, the Attack cards just kill the progress of the game.  At this point, especially with more players, I highly recommend that you REMOVE THE ATTACK CARDS from the decks.

Basic game, 2-players (with non-gamer wife), Attack cards NOT included - This was a really enjoyable experience.  My wife enjoys Lost Cities and some other word games, but nothing too gamey.  Therefore, the concept of deck-building is completely new to her, so I explained the mechanism and the considerations when selecting cards to add to her deck.  She caught on about half way through the game and seemed to enjoy it.  Removed the Attack cards was definitely the right decision.  The game felt more fun and positive overall and moved along at a good pace.  My wife enjoyed it and we played a second time.  We plan to play the basic game several more times without the Attack cards before trying any of the extra modules that came with the game.

Overall, this game delivers on the idea of a word-building deck-building game.  It works quite well, provided that the Attack cards are not used!  However, I do feel that a few of the cards are either too powerful or just under-priced given their ability.  Example: The 'R' that has the "For each card in hand, +1 card next hand" for only 5¢.  This card is incredibly powerful since you can typically use it to enable yourself to draw 9 cards on your next turn thus making it almost too easy to spell 9- and 10-letter words or words valuable enough to get the larger Fame cards.  Maybe I'm wrong, but so far I've seen this card in the hand of the winners more often than not.

The production quality of this game is quite nice.  The box is sturdy (although the packaging for the initial shipping was unbelievably bad), the cards a coated and have a nice feel to them, and the card dividers are a nice addition.  I would have liked some custom tokens rather than wooden cubes, but I guess that's okay.  Maybe I'll pimp the game out a bit later if it gets enough play.  The rules are okay, but not great as there are plenty of details not explicitly covered.  There are some consistency issues with fonts, terminology, and graphic design that's a bit annoying, but not game breaking and probably not obvious to the majority of people (I am a bit of perfectionist and seem to immediately identify all the little "bugs").  The Kickstarter price point seems fair for the game, given that it included shipping.  Overall, the game is fairly light, but it's fun and if my wife enjoys it, then it's definitely a keeper!

Play this as a word-game, and not as a strategy game, or you will probably be disappointed.

Only a few games in, but heavily prefer this to a game of Scrabble. Creating words allows you to choose and buy more letters, some which have special powers, etc. There is more than one way to win plus it also has extra cards for optional themes and even a co-op variant. So far it's been a good ride.

Acquired in trade for Formula D (As I know this one will get much more table time... and portable, so will be going on holidays with us!)

For me this is almost the perfect word game, and a great way to introduce the desk-building mechanism to word-game loving wifey. Plus, even though I'm fairly poor at wordy games, the game allows me to ask for help from others and reward them for doing so.

From now on this will be our go to deck-building type game as we have never tried (or to be honest, never wanted to... Theme!!!) something like Dominion.

For me shines best as a 2P battle or co-op.

Wifey approved.

Easily the biggest hit with everyone I've introduced it to in the past month. At least 3 people have gone out and bought it afterwards. Like most deck building games, the mechanics are very easy to explain and people seem to intuitively 'get' the idea of making words from your cards. The fact that every card has a unique letter and occasional power means this should get a lot of reply for some time. Highly recommended!

Scrabble meets deckbuilding.  You use letter cards in your hand to spell words to get money, which can be used to purchase additional letters, some with interesting bonuses.  This game is fairly simplistic and lacks a great deal of depth (though I imagine that the included expansion modules could change that), but I think it's a great introduction into the world of deckbuilding.

This is a really fun word game. It took mere minutes to set up and learn and it's very clever. A friend who isn't a fan of deck builders dove right into this game with us and loved it, so it's a nice gateway game as well.

Dominion-style deck-building game mixed with Scrabble. The cards each have one or two letters on them. In order to play, you need to create a word with what you have in your hand. More expensive cards give you more buying power later on if you can make a word with them, except the VP cards, which act as wilds and are otherwise worth nothing. As with Scrabble, there are bonuses for creating longer words. Like most deck-building games, this one plays better with fewer players. The Scrabble element exacerbates this, as there is quite a bit of downtime. No one I know really likes the game, though I would consider playing again 2p or with a timer. But the way I see it, you might as well play Scrabble if you want to play a word game.

A cool, quick-playing deck-builder with a word game attached. I don't love pure deck builders like Dominion but this game takes that basic mechanism and attaches it to a fun, quick-playing (for the most part!) word game. Maybe it should be played with a timer, if someone consistently takes too long on their turn? But if everyone just tries to keep the game moving along, it does! And unlike the other recent word game, Letter Tycoon, there is little or no change in available letters from turn to turn ... so you can actually plan from turn to turn!

Very good word game!

This is a very unique and clever game, it is pretty much Dominion mixed with Scrabble.  Players have starting decks consisting of R, S, T, L, and N as well as five wild cards.  On a turn they are drawing 5-card hands and making words with these letters.  The starting letters are worth 1 cent with the wilds worth nothing.  Players use the letters they draw to make words to buy new letters or letter combinations from the supply.  Many of the new letters also have special abilities such as drawing extra cards or double word scores much like Scrabble.

I like word games and have a decent vocabulary so I really enjoyed this game.  It does have a few rough edges though.  One problem with the game is that, especially early, by virtue of how it is played players can simply copy each other.  If you have the same or similar letters, especially using wilds, as the previous player you can play the same word as them.  As the game progresses and decks vary this becomes less of a problem though.

I also have the same problem with this as I do standard Scrabble and a lot of other word games.  The player or players with the best vocabulary invariably do better and other players can wind up not having very much fun.  The game is really best played with players who have very similar vocabularies but of course that is hard to accomplish on a whim.

Finally, I think the game needs some kind of penalty for trying to spell an incorrect word.  Probably not something as harsh as Scrabble's "miss a turn" but perhaps a point/money deduction.  This is easy enough to implement but I wish the rules included this, something that we knew was playtested and fair.

I also like the inclusion of player powers, awards, and themes to vary the game up a bit if the basic game gets stale.  All-in-all a decent amount of good game on offer here in a small package.

This game is a bit of a strain on the brain, but it's a fun kind of strain. Surprisingly you do not need to be all that great at word games to play this game. There are enough wilds and special cards and variety that a player can do quite well even without being a Scrabble master. As an author I really enjoyed the light literary sense of humor the game has about itself as well.

RATING: 8
I really get a kick out of this game. I suck at games like Scrabble but this uses the Dominion card system in a way I love. It's just fun, it's more of a solo game in that you're just trying to make words while others are also. Eventually nobody is paying attention to what the others are doing because you're focused on trying to make your own word, but I love it.

Dominion meets Scrabble in this deck-building word game.  Beyond the novel (no pun intended) idea of having to spell words in order to use the cards, there are several other interesting new ideas.  Common cards are usable by all players until one person creates a word long enough to claim it, then it belongs to that person only, and will be shuffled into their deck.  In addition, the game comes with wooden "favor" tokens usable when a player wants help building a word, that the player lending assistance can then redeem as any letter to make a longer word.  However, Scrabble players, cruciverbalists and older people will automatically have an advantage due to their development of the speech-language centres of the brain.

I like word games, and I appreciate that somebody identified that ripping off Dominion and turning it into a word game would actually work better as a game than the game it's ripping off.

Fowers included almost a dozen expansion and variant modules right in the box, including a co-op mode that's not simply "bad things happen, fix bad things" and eliminates the quarterbacking problem (unless one of you is particularly terrible at word games). It's a crazy value. If you have any interest in word games, this is the one to get.

An interesting concept, but in execution I found Paperback somewhat slow and unexpectedly frustrating.

At the beginning of the game, the players' decks were identical and had lots of freedom, so you could just toss out whatever word you wanted, unless you managed to draw all five consonants in one hand. As a result, the person to get the first common card is always the first one to random-draw his/her two-letter card. Toward the end, we found the lack of vowels and certain consonants annoying, in that the best source of vowels is two-letter cards, which force you to use them in conjunction with a fixed consonant in a specific order. So this was frustrating, and we often ended up with hands that would be great, if only they could be anagrammed freely.

To be fair, my opponent and I were mostly focused on building good words rather than rushing down the VP piles. But the former is, as mentioned above, often a frustrating task. Since word-building is the point of the game, and where a lot of the fun is expected, we were disappointed by the rigidity we experienced.

It doesn't really live up to the hype of "here's a crossbreed between two common game mechanics!!!". I want to like it, and it's probably close enough that a search for house rules may redeem it. But on its own, I think it's rather mediocre.

After some discussion, we think there are two main things that need to be addressed:
* The VP cards need to be nerfed, because right now the obvious equilibrium is just to buy out the two lowest stacks as quickly as possible. Sure, you could get cards that are actually worth points and try to save up for the bigger VP cards, but what are the odds of actually getting the right combo at the right time? It's pretty hard to get up to 11, never mind 14 cents. We suggest the VP cards should function as vowel-only wilds as a start.
* The high-end cards need to be buffed. Again, any strategy built around getting those expensive cards is going to be outscored by people greedily purchasing the lower two stacks of VP cards. Perhaps there's a strategy around trashing down to a consistent deck that plays the same one or two words each turn, but it's not really clear how you'd get there (a lot of the trash effects show up on consonants, which won't mix well with your high-end buy). Also ending the game like that is lame. I'd suggest the 6-9 cards be extended so that each one can stand for one of two "rare" consonants; maybe even one of three for the 9-cent cards.

Edit: Having played this a few more times, I think the game's better than I originally thought as long as turn length is limited. Players should be prohibited from taking  more than the occasional one- or two-minute turn. We also played with the rule that the VP wild cards could only be used for vowels. People only ran into it once or twice, but I think it did well enough in preventing an all-out rush for the VP cards. I think the important part was to break the habit of trying to use every card, even in hands where the letter distribution looks particularly promising.

My wife likes words, but I haven't found a word game she actually likes. Some of them like Bananagrams are a little boring, but she also dislikes Scrabble because I beat her (despite my much worse vocabulary) by taking advantage of bonus spaces. So, I got Paperback with the goal of finding a word game she liked. She loves co-ops and likes deckbuilders, so I had high hopes.

Our 1 play so far was mixed. I think we were too tired because it felt like a lot of work coming up with words. But I definitely like the concept. There are some flaws like how the first 2 rounds are slow and how the co-op game encourages you to sandbag. Also, the last card of the co-op game pretty much requires a one-use double words score card and if you don't draw one for 4 turns you are very likely to lose.

This is my compromise for playing word games. Deck building is interesting. Still rewards having good knowledge of words, while not making it the driving force of the game (like Scrabble).

Fun but flawed.

The gameplay is a great idea, but some of the cards are obviously unbalanced. Also, maybe it's just me and the people I play with, but the idea of spelling longer and longer words until you get to an 11-letter word to end the game is laughable. We're lucky to get a single 8-letter word in the entire game. This is due both to the limitations of the cards themselves and player vocabulary.

Got it when I saw there is a german print and play version, because my wife is russian and so she gets a chance to learn new words and work more with german words. Quite a lot of fun, very much like the deck building aspects to it. Setup is quick, play is quick, too. Mini-expansions and coop mode add ways to expand replayability and to play with people who have too much disadvantage otherwise. Slowly becoming a favorite game for my wife, because of the language training aspect.

Paperback should be a great game, but it's at the same time too short and too long. I've only played at four, so perhaps a two player game would solve this, but it feels like you get too few opportunities to play the cards you acquire and there's too much analysis paralysis between playing your word and purchasing your next card.

I am not a big fan of word games, but thought I would give it a try. I like the idea and the mechanisms, but it's just to much of a struggle for me. To be fair, I need to mention that English is not my native language and because of this, I think this game is just too difficult for me to enjoy.

Paperback tests both your verbal dexterity and your strategic planning. Much of the strategy is in purchasing letters in combinations that commonly appear together in words, but you'll also have to ensure you're making enough money to purchase higher-scoring letters and eventually points-earning fame cards. There are several competing avenues for scoring points -- forming long words, using more exotic (and expensive) letters, or building words within a certain theme.

Have the Android version, and my wife and I split between playing each other, and teaming up against the AI. The AI is pretty tough (the smartest level), and uses words we've never seen. Still really enjoy playing it, though, regardless of opponent. If we could play only one of Hardback or Paperback, we'd choose Hardback (at present), but both play differently enough that I'm very happy to be able to play them both.

RATING: 6
Edit: Sold after several plays and seeing that biggest memory of words wins, just like Scrabble.  Kind of disappointed.  Crossing fingers for Hardback.  Word Domination is the game that beat this one to a pulp.


I grew up playing Boggle and Scrabble. Don't care to play either ever again. For years I'd hoped I'd find a word game that could rekindle my interest. Had high hopes for the re-issue of Sid Sackson's Buy Word, but it just wasn't that interesting. 

Paperback is a deck builder like Dominion. When I first played Dominion I loved it.  But then I got tired of the mechanic real fast and then all I could see was the math at work. Theme? What theme?  Not that Paperback has a strong theme. No, it's a word game. It might not be an innovative deck builder, but as a word game it's truly ground breaking. The deck building part just complements the deck building mechanic.  IOW, I finally found a word game to play!

Have been playing this game non-stop with my Wife recently and it is such a quick way to get a game in and pass some time in good company. Our favorite part is coming up with the longest and most complicated words that we can think of and consistently cheering each other when we create a particularly large word.  People who enjoy words i.e. readers, scrabble players, crossword puzzlers etc. will enjoy this game.

Provisional rating, only play. Great idea, though not particularly my cup of tea. I would most enjoy the puzzle of finding the best word if there was no timer, yet I can't enjoy the puzzle knowing I'm keeping people waiting.  If all players had big hands to mull over at the same moment then it would be less of an issue, but it seemed more common that one person was agonising while the others had formed their word of 5 letters.

Where Dominion begins to feel like you're going through the motions with limited choices, Paperback adds the extra layer of coming up with the best word you can.  Really clever and engaging.  The advantage here is that you're always thinking when it's not your turn.

Love the production, great drawings, graphic design and quality.  An overall very clever pacakge.

All of that said, I can't really say I have much "fun" when I play it.  Feels more like an activity, not something I usually seek out when wanting to play games.

Homemade modified to swedish version. Also translated it to finnish but still untested.  Translation and new letter distribution seems to have been succesful.

If the concept of a word game crossed with a deck-building game is exciting to you, then you'll like this.

It left me cold, as I'm not a huge fan of either genre.  I do have a difficult time seeing who the game is aimed at.  The word gamers I know are not big deck-builder fans, and vice versa.  The whole package was rather dry, apart from the very slick novel cards.  It also has the usual balance problems that are present in many Kickstarter games, though it is less-so than most other titles of that type that I've tried.  The doubling cards, in particular, are way too powerful, and too rare to count on.

It also is quite group-dependent, as a quick playstyle is necessary to enjoying the game.  If any player takes too long, or the group spends too much time looking for the best play, then the game bogs down and becomes much less fun.  Make sure that everybody is on board for a speedier playtime, and everybody will enjoy it more.

Combining standard ("Dominion"-style) deck building with Scrabble - doesn't that sound terrible, bland, boring, or square? Well, this game does exactly that, but boy, does this turn out to be amazing. The game came out of nowhere for me. It does not get the publicity it deserves. Everything that people did not like about Dominion works beautifully here. There is interaction, there is lots of thinking and less of luck, much variety - and it even comes with expansions and a solo variant. Most importantly, this is the kind of game that even non-gamers will love. Besides worker placement, deckbuilding is arguably one of the most interesting and innovative boardgame mechanic of the last couple of years - for a reason. Now people can enjoy that with the thrill and giggles of solving word puzzles each and every turn. Plus, each of the cards provides extra challenges and rewards. All around A M A Z I N G game. Secret tip of the year. Go get it already.

This was a great implementation for a deckbuilder!  I was a little worried that AP would set in as people looked for words to build, but the option to give a cube to another player for help in building the best word and the prevalence of wild cards in the deck kept AP to a minimum. The quality of the game is also fantastic.  The cards and box are very well made, and the illustrations on the cards are lovely.

I'm not terribly into word games, but this one is just to clever to ignore. Using the deck-building mechanic to drive the game gives a nice sense of escalation as the words players create get bigger and bigger with better cards. The graphic design is great as well. Simple, but it conveys the paperback writer theme incredibly well.

Throw your copy of Scrabble in the garbage, Paperback is superior in every way. Hopefully, it's expandable so the experience can just keep growing.

This is what would happen if Scrabble and Dominion had a baby. Paperback is a good intro to deck building for someone whose only board game experience is with more "traditional" games, and a palatable option for a word game for those that normally stay clear of those. A nice opportunity to bridge the gap between players with vastly different preferences in game themes/mechanics.

While you can play this with more people, I think this one shines best as a 2 player.

A fun deckbuilder that uses words for currency to make buys for more letter cards and victory points. 

Be careful playing with people who are really into word games already as they may get caught up in trying to come up with some crazy word every turn and I don't believe that's the intent of this game, words are just supposed to be used as a component of the game. 

To explain, I have no qualms getting a tuned deck and spelling practically the same word every turn for high points to start buying up all the victory points. This seemed unheard of to people who were really into games like scrabble and boggle who seemed to have their heart set on never using the same word twice and are upset when they are defeated.

It's not a word game, it's a game that uses words.

I probably enjoy it most just with the wife, but with the right people I'm sure it could be fun with more.

A combination of deck building with a word game seems inevitable. So the question is if Paperback does a reasonable job of it. For me the answer is yes. It is a nice self contained deck builder I can bring out with my wife without worrying about multiple expansions and additional rules. The downside of the word component is the time spent building words on your turn. Still in a two player setting it was not egregious.

I love me some deck-building and this is definitely an interesting take on the mechanic.  Just be and sure to play the simultaneous variant to keep downtime to a minimum and introduce an element of interaction.  My only complaints are gameplay feels long for what it is, and player powers are unbalanced and don't bring much to the game except fiddliness.

The co-op mode is an interesting idea, but it's not much fun playing against the clock.

Mashup of a deckbuilder and a word game.  Have played 2p a couple of times (non-coop) and had fun each time.  The rulebook includes a few variants or "mini-expansions" to spice the game up a bit, they weren't too complicated so we played with them from the beginning. The coop mode was okay, but we found it to be far too easy. The box was well designed as it was designed with sleeves in mind.  I sleeved all cards with FFS05 (gray) sleeves and the divider cards with SwanPanasia 65x100mm sleeves and everything still fits with a bit of room to spare.

Great word game. The deck building is painless as players become more interested in finding the best word to play. With many wild cards, it's not too difficult to find a word in hand. People who don't like word games won't find much to like here. 

I recommend removing the attack cards so players have more time to look for words between turns or leaving the attack cards and playing the simultaneous play variant discussed in the bgg forums. I also like the no plagiarism variant to stop players from repeating the same word.

Colors are bad for colorblind but have no impact while playing the game. Colors are used only to help sort the card values that can be read in the corners easily by the colorblind.

I generally have not had success keeping deck builders around... but it is a pleasant mechanic at this point and Paperback is quite novel.  The word building is generally pretty easy, but you have some Scrabble-like turns that are enjoyable as well.  I can see this outstaying its welcome on those turns with people that are too AP prone... and some word game fans might not enjoy the deckbuilding aspect (like my new game concept averse mother) but if you like word games and deck building Paperback is definitely something you should check out.

This might be my favorite two or three player game of 2014. Love it, love it, love it, but other people I have tried to play with aren't big into word games. I lowered the score due to that, but I will continue to fight for it!

Not a fan of word games but gave this a shot on the back of the deck-building which I hoped would add enough interest. It didn't although the co-op version gave it some legs. Have to accept that word games just aren't my thing.

Marriage of Dominion (which I love) and Scrabble (which I detest).  Has the standard word-game problems: analysis paralysis, what constitutes a word, etc.  But the deck-builder implementation is deft.  Not bad.

First impression: Deck-building word game that rewards lateral thinking.  Score!  This matches the pace of [thing=36218][/thing] (provided you require people to play immediately when it's their turn, or employ a timer, and utilize the Bounty variant), with the satisfaction of a word game; however, instead of having to milk every last point out of each word, word values merely give you purchasing power.  While nonetheless important, this can give you enough wiggle room to get what you want without hurting yourself.  Also, the optional Theme cards, Player Power cards, and Award cards give the players more variety and challenges.

I can't wait to see the mobile digital version of this cracking game!

On the opposite end of a spectrum from the excellent [thing=39635][/thing], this word game uses just as much lateral thinking — no, more — but within the confines of the letters and wilds at your disposal.  You know, more like in [thing=320][/thing]; however, some of your cards have pairs of letters, and some have powers you want to employ.  …and rather than the values your words just scoring you points, instead they provide the currency you can use to buy new cards that turn.  Mechanically, it doesn't fall far from the [thing=36218][/thing] tree, but that is a really good thing:  It's a fast-paced, deckbuilding word game.

Between [thing=97690][/thing], [thing=71655][/thing], and [thing=141572][/thing], I'm becoming such a [company=12549]gabob[/company] fanboy….

A fun game for those who prefer lighter fare or simply aren't into games that are of a "take that" mentality. It's a great warm up game or gateway game.

I don't remember buying this. Likely an Amazon late-night impulse purchase. I haven't played it yet. Theme is awesome, artwork is cute.

Extremely enjoyable word game. I'm not good at and it's prone to AP, so either 2 players for VS or just coop/solo. Still very good though even with those caveats.

Great game. Gives you the feel of scrabble and makes you feel rewarded for having a large vocabulary, without giving the win automatically to the one with the best vocab. Having good skills at deckbuilding is equally, if not more, important.

Love this game. 
Each part (scrabble, deck-building) gives the other a reason for being. 
Tasteful and stylish as well.

Gefällt mir sehr gut! Ich mag Wortspiele, aber Scrabble war mir immer eine Spur zu öde. Paperback kombiniert Scrabble mit dem Deck Building von Dominion, und das funktioniert wunderbar. Manchmal zieht sich das Überlegen etwas, aber das ist bei solchen Spielen unumgänglich.

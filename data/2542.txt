It didn't work for us in a three player game, we quickly ran out of cards and after that we always could play colours that others couldn't; making it a game of pure luck. Will try again with more players.

The aspect of knowing what the other players have changes this game from a standard trick taking game to one with some very deep strategy.

The rules need to be fired into the sun.  The game is nowhere as complicated as the rules make it sound.

Fun little card game where players choose different card patterns to put down.  Like colors "battle" and cards with no competition (no like colors) are automatically won.  Nothing too intense, but good filler.

The art isn't my favorite...a bit overdone but on the other hand it does make card recognition easy. Would need another playing to firm up my rating but my feeling is that the game plays itself to some extent...

Inoffensive, but there have been so many better filler games recently that this isn't likely to see much more play.

Not a bad game a bit basic for me but easy to get into and plays well in a group. It can't really be played with 2 unless you make the second player match the first players cards. You can shorten the length of the game by simply removing cards from the 2 play decks. There's plenty of room to customise it. I would have liked to have seen a bigger variety of cards or different types of unicorn etc. but i guess they had to keep costs down. Great value for money if you have a group to play it with.

Kaartspel met leuke dynamics.  Je kan alleen je eigen kaarten winnen, maar het is zeker even interessant om goede kaarten van anderen weg te spelen.  Vergeet dat niet!!

0 = dubbele punten voor die kleur --> ik geloof dat je er zeker 2 moet hebben om te winnen

+10 per kleur waarin je de meerderheid hebt
+5 per kleur waarin je een gedeelde meerderheid hebt

RATING: 6
An interesting card game that I would lump into the trick-taking genre.  One of the few games that I have played where you know the suit (color) of cards held by opponents as well as the suit of the cards throughout the draw stack (which gets fanned out).  ** COLOR-BLIND gamers beware, the red & purple cards are very similar, and it's important to know the color of everyone's cards.  FROM OTHER USERS:  The game primarily involves preventing opponents from playing cards... is that fun or annoying??
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

If you hate a fair amount of randomness and luck, look elsewhere.  That's fine by me.  I like this game as a filler or for a quick-ish game with my mostly non-gaming family.

RATING: 3
With so much open information, the action you should take each turn is very predictable; there are very few real decisions for you to make.  Everyone "banks" the best cards they can and very few conflicts arise.  The person who draws the most 0's early in the game will always win.  Barely playable with 5, it is totally pointless with less than that because you can almost always pick a pair of a color that nobody else has.  No thanks, there are much better games out there.

Interesting trick-taking mechanic elevates the paper-thin theme to create a nice, classic-style card game.

RATING: 6
I had a chance to play this recently and enjoyed myself. I can easily see playing this a number of times, and eventually building a strategy of game play. Good stuff. Knowing the current color (suit) make-up of your opponents hands is a delightful twist to what would have normally been a run-of-the-mill trick taking type game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Clever untraditional trick-taking game from Rudiger Dorn - there are multiple tricks each round but there's no requirement to follow suit and some other twists which make this play very differently from most games - not least that the card backs tell you which suits the others are holding. It all makes for an interestingly different game but don't play with three - it's simply too easy to get low (but high scoring) cards into your score pile, making it a bit of an exercise in randomness.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Bought this mainly due to the fact I loved Herr Dorn's Traders of Genoa, as I usually avoid the small-box stuff anymore. This is certainly not earthshattering, but I found it to be a decent enough light/middle-weight entry. The key is that it's a different, novel design, not just some new slightly dressed-up trick-taking or set-collecting game like Knizia has been ramming down our throats in recent years. There are tactics to discover, and games that are this nicely colorful usually work for me :) Not one I'm dying to play every week, but good nontheless. Much better with more players (3 doesn't quite work; 4 is OK; 5 is best).

This game is a fun, light, set collecting game with a bluffing element.  I enjoyed it fine, and could even see playing it as a prelude to something heavy.  It seems like it handles five players well, which is nice.  I don't know how it works with three - but it seems like there might not be enough conflict.  I liked it, though, and may attempt to acquire it at some point.

Not sure what to say about this yet. Only played it once so perhaps what I'm going to say is wrong. However, here is the only possible strategy that I could see. Avoid any conflict with your lower cards 0-9 or 10 and attack with anything above a 9 or 10. You have to look at what people are holding to make the best play but thats it really. It is an awesome looking card game.

Good trick taking game with a twist. The back of the cards are the same colour as the suits (6 different ones) so you know what suits the other players have but not the values of them. This leads to some interesting games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Different trick taking game. Players play one to three cards face down to the table. Cards can be in any of six colours, and the backs show the colour, but not the value. When all have played or passed, the cards are flipped up and mini-tricks are played out colour vs colour. The goal is to take low value cards with high scoring symbols on them (like Mu). If you manage to take a zero, that acts as a multiplier for your other symbols. Very interesting and worth a look.

The core mechanic here is cool. Seems likely to be better with more players since the impact of chance is reduced - less possibility of lucking out and getting a lot of just the right color and being able to score it freely.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A game that resembles both a cardgame and a trick taking game. I wouldn't consider it a trick taking game, but there definately have some resemblances to it. The intrigue of the game is about managing your hand, and deciding when to go for points, and when to go for draws. Your incentive to play high cards seems muddled. Denying people points is a good move, but it comes at one less card in in your hand for you. It is a good move, but you don't get a lot of reward.

Unique card game. Different color backs let you know which creatures the other players have and allow you to choose which ones to draw. That gives the game interesting tactical decisions, but it's weird that the best option usually is to avoid battles. Very good artwork, but too little variation for my tastes, as all cards of the same creature have the same piece of illustration. Definitely better with more players, the game doesn't work well with just three.

Don't play in poor light, and don't play with just 3. It's all about setting up colour combinations to score well, and denying opponents the ability to play. Innovative and well done.

Egyik kedvenc játékszerzőm Rüdigern Dorn egyszerű kártyajátéka. A játék lényege, hogy mindenki látja, hogy milyen színű lapja van az ellenfeleknek, csak azok értékét nem látják. A kezdő játékos kiválaszt 1-3 kártyát (legfeljebb három különbözőt vagy két azonos és egy különbözőt vagy két azonost vagy két különbözőt vagy egyet)
A többi játékos által kijátszott azonos színű kártyákkal csatázik, a magasabb szám nyer. Csakhogy a magasabb számokon kisebb nyeremény van, az alacsonyabbakon, amelyekkel nehezebb nyerni, több nyeremény van. Cél, hogy a kisebb számokkal nyerjünk. Egyszerű szórakoztató játék.

A stupid simple euro card game which is not so bad compared to other stupid simple euro card game. The main problem I see to it is that there is absolutely no interest in playing any other cards configuration than 2-1. So everybody plays 2-1. A change in the combat mechanics can solve this problem. Reducing the number of cards in hand with more players is a good idea. It also allows you to exceed the 5 player limit. Having a hand limit of 5 card add more strategy since you can't have all the 6 colors in your hand.

If there was something else beside the card playing (a la Taj Mahal), then there might be something to the game, but as it stands, only a small amount of strategy.

First impression: An interesting trick-taking game with 6 suits and suits are visible from card backs. Leading player can choose to play 1-3 cards. Other players must play as many cards and they must have the same distribution in suits (eg. 1-2 or 1-1-1). Usually there is no need to play same suits that have been played. 

I liked the game as it is a very weird trick-taking game. It is too easy to get cards you want because no-one has played the suit and you know others don't have it anymore. You can only get your own cards and it makes playing quite uninteresting in some situations. Gargon isn't a game for serious gaming but it's a fun trick-taking game for 5 players.

RATING: 6.8
Top Trumps for grown-ups? Well, pretty much, although  there are enough clever twists in the rules to appeal to the strategists. Best suited to four poker players because the ability to read the other players well is a must. The semi-open draw decks and potential for card-counting encourage a hefty chunk of deep thought, so the game tends to earn more than its fair share of table time. The flipside is some fairly uninspiring card art, and what could amount to an insoluble imbalance problem if playing with inexperienced participants.

Further Thoughts: This one just won't quit! Lots and lots of strategy required here, but crucially you could never play it well with a bunch of strangers. A mysterious and enigmatic delight, upgraded from 7 to 8.

This neat card game has a lot more depth than most. The fact that you can see which "suits" are in each hand and which suits can be drawn adds a level of strategy that I have not seen in any other card game. Beautiful art work on the cards. And I love the various colors.

Don’t see the strategy. Don’t see the fun. Don’t see why you would ever want to play defensive either. Why butt heads with someone on a colour, with the potential of losing, while each other player (other than the last) gets away scot free with non-competed colours.

I’m not sure where the fun or the challenge is. Let’s take the fun factor ... peering around at other people’s colours, peering, peering, playing, simultaneous reveal; no tension, no drama, no theme. And the challenge? No card counting, decision quality is mostly guesswork, in fact your main decision is who to pus this turn, if anyone. Which makes for a why me game.

I hadn't a clear idea how to work with my cards to get many points and only after the game was over I realized the importance of some cards and figured some possible strategies. I will have to play it more to either heighten or lower the vote. I am not sure, if I will give this game a second chance to shine...

A very different sort of card game.  Not really a card game, but more of a game that uses cards to control the mechanic.

Intriguing. May be "pseudo-heavy" in that it encourages careful thought but I am not sure how much it is rewarded. Needs more plays. Definitely better with more players as there is more competition and more cunning. I think the strategy probably revolves more around knowing when to draft cards rather than the details of playing them. Not brilliant, but OK, and worth some play.

The backstory is pretty fantastic, you know magicians using monsters to get the Gargon Amulet, over time the only thing left is a card game based on it.  Cute.  Well, the game itself is cute.  There are certainly decisions to be made, but in a three player game, the best decision is always to play it safe.  I'm betting the game gets better with more people.  As someone in midplay said though, "Is this fun?" he even had a couple beers in him.  I'm not entirely sure.  Will give it a go with more players (I have played enough games to know that while I'd give this a 4.5 with three it will be much better with more).  The art looks like it should be on the side of a van.

2 plays.
It's kind of a trick-taking game. There are 6 suits 0-15 (2 0s). Lead player plays 1-3 cards face down in any combination except 3-of-a-kind (going by color, not number). Everyone else must either follow that pattern, or draw that many cards from the draw piles (the rest of the deck is divided into 2 and fanned on the table so you can see which colors are coming up; can pick from either/both fans). Then, reveal cards played. If more than 1 person played a color, each reveals the highest number - high wins and is added to the score pile, loser card is discarded. Continue until all cards are resolved. Play 2 rounds. At the end, you get points for each coin pictured on the cards (low numbers have more coins); these are doubled if you have a 0 card for that color. In addition, there is a 10VP bonus if you won the most cards of a color; if tied, each player gets 5VP. Most points at the end wins!

It's another trick-taking-card-game-with-a-twist. Probably pretty good, but there are better ones out there. Will have to play it some more, now that I know/remember the rules!

[Amigo Spiele 2001 edition] {Fantasy; trick-taking, drafting, bluffing; optimal 4p} Rudiger Dorn designed a special trick-taking game: players can know the suit composition of a hand of all players; players can play multiple cards in a trick; different players can win a card in a trick, etc. It's more tactical than other trick-taking games because players have more information about the card distribution, can draft a card and can have more choices of playing cards.  However, the game play is not as fun as other trick-taking games for me. It may be due to the longer down time and boring game play.

[Variant] The "Open Winnings Variant" is unnecessary.  It just increases down time.

Unique card game where the suits (color) are shown on the backs as well as the fronts.  It's a blind trick taking game where the winner of the trick keeps his card and all others discard theirs.  It's interesting and novel but I'd hoped for a bit more.  My biggest beef with the game is that what strategy there is seems pretty obvious - play colors that the guys to your left don't have.  It's almost always to your advantage to avoid confrontation and that means that the winner will almost always be the player who lucks into the best draw of cards.

Gargon is a card game that I hadn't ever heard of before. The deck has six suits (green, red, purple, blue, yellow, white) with cards numbered 0 - 15 in each suit (with two zeros). The backs of these cards show which color the front is, so you always know what color cards your opponents have.

The goal of the game is to get points by adding cards with coins to your collected card pile. Higher number cards have fewer coins, and lower value cards have more coins... except zeros have none.

Each round, the start player (which rotates each round), leads one, t
wo or three cards. There is a restriction that they can't lead three cards of a single color. Other players who choose to play cards have to follow the general pattern they've set. So if the start player leads a single color, every other player who plays must play a single card. If the start player plays two blues and a yellow, every other player who plays must play two cards of one color and another card of a different color. If you can't play, or choose not to, then you draw as many cards as were played. The last player in turn order cannnot play a color that hasn't already been played.

After everyone has played cards, which are played face down, you start resolving conflicts where multiple players have played the same color. Starting with one of the colors of the start player, every player with cards of that color, reveals their cards in that color. Everyone's highest card faces off against each other. Whoever has the highest card adds that card to their score pile... the other player's discard their losing cards. This is repeated for the second card of that color (if two cards of a color were played). If there's ever a situation where you play a card and no one else has a card of that color, you just add the card to your score pile.

Losing players draw a replacement from one of the two draw piles. Players who choose to draw cards instead of playing them draw from these piles as well. The piles are supposed to be slightly skewed so that you can see the color of the next couple of cards in each pile. Whenever either pile is emptied, the game ends, and that round is completed after which the game is scored.

At the end of the game, there's a contest to see who got the most cards of each color which is worth 10 points. Then you score your coins. If you managed to get a card with a value of zero, then your score in that color is doubled. If you got both zero's your score is quadrupled.

This is an interesting game. You want to find a way to play your cards when other players can't contest you... like playing 2 greens when other players only have a single green, or going in with a single blue when all the remaining players in rotation don't have a blue card. Trying to figure out what to lead and how to follow is the heart of the game and is thinkier than first appears.

Some cool ideas in this. The combination matching is neat, and the knowledge of everyone's hand colors is cool. But there's a lot of power in targeting a specific player sort of at random, and zeroes are too easy to get out.

First play - I was a little sketchy on how battles were resolved but I understood the scoring. After a few rounds it all made sense and I was able to play with some strategy as opposed to just putting cards down. I wasn't able to win any of the zero cards as the one I had was defeated early. I hung onto two "2" cards until the last round and managed to win them both. This made the difference between fifth and first place and I managed to squeak by with the win.

I'm not a great fan of simultaneous selection, and the battle mechanic seems to be mostly about avoiding conflicts rather than guessing what the other player has played.

This game whizzes by!  Knowing your opponents' suits [creature types] is a fascinating element to this game.  Also, the requirement to follow the pattern that is led sometimes allows the leader to guarantee herself some cards.  The slight downside about that is that others can feel sort of helpless when someone does that.  Of course, due to the very good pace of Gargon, it is barely frustrating when it happens, and more often serves to remind you that you could do that, too....  ;^)

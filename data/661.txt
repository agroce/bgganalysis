It's a lot like Oh Hell! but players have less control. Doesn't add enough to the genre to keep this game.

RATING: 7
My rating of "7" is coming from a guy who's not a huge fan of card games. I like this one, though, and it has all the characteristics of a classic trick taking game with a few twists. For example, there's only three suits. As well, the ominous dark shadow of Bob's hat continually looms over the game: will it bring blessing or plunge your point total into negative territory? Speaking of which, it's amazing how often players are in negative territory! The tension level in the game increases with each hand, as the number of cards increases by one with each subsequent deal. People are biting nails by the final hand!

This update of Wer Hat Mehr didn&#039;t improve the game much for me.  My rating for the original game: 4.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A trick-taking game with an easy introduction to bidding and a painless way to determine trump. The growing number of cards in people's hands make successive hands play differently. I still have no idea how to assign a value to Bob's Hat.

UPDATE: Score significantly dropped (8 -> 6). There seems to be a runaway leader problem -- once someone is so far ahead, no amount of damage will make them not win, and the only thing that can catch you up is making stupid bids. Plus, I own so many other trick-taking games that are better than this one...

Another Oh Hell variant.  It's an OK game, but runs too long and isn't as interesting Oh Hell, so really...why bother?  The points for Bob's hat unbalance things too much.

If you like trick taking card games, then you would probably enjoy this game. I recently played with a good (and brilliant) friend who had never played a trick-taking game in his life. He failed miserably (ending up with negative points) and was frustrated that he didn't grasp the strategy and thus didn't like the game. We played with my 10 yr. old who is familiar with games like Hearts. He fared much better and enojoyed the game much more. This is a fine alternative to Whist, Diminishing Bridge (Wizards) or Oh Hell, but has a slightly more chaotic feel to it.

RATING: 5
Didn't care for this one ... it's not bad, but about average for this small-box stuff I thought. The "Bob's Hat" cards (which I gather are the difference between this and Wer Hat Mehr) effecitvely add a huge random element, since the points for Bob's Hat (over which you have very little control) far outweigh the points for playing well. Combined with graphic design that is at best amateurish, Bob's Hat didn't do a lot for me. Not too bad with 3 players, but gets pretty weak with more.

This is a three-suit trick-taking game involving bidding, a trump suit that's decided randomly at the beginning of each round, and a varying value of Bob's hat (dealer chooses +/-10).  I think this game is okay, but there are many other trick-taking games I'd rather play.

100+ heartfelt plays (10x3p, 5x4p, 4x5p). Playing this after Bottle Imp, I found I preferred this a lot more (less luck, or at least, plenty of luck yet they are situations of luck that are not unavoidably hopeless which can happen in some hands of Bottle Imp).  Really fun card game with excellent mechanism for bidding goals.  Push-your-luck bidding incurs gulping feeling.  Holding breath.  I like how the escalation of cards per hand helps propel the game. I like the artwork a lot.  Miss N. won this time after time, a confounding indication of wiles over luck (or even male mental brute force). Update1. I made wooden tokens for bidding, Bob's hat value, and a 4-sided die for determining trump. Update2. I tentatively think the more we play it, the better we're gettin'--higher scores, tighter games. So I guess I'm gonna make this a 9'er. Update 3. I think a key to doing well in this game is leaping forward and playing very aggressively (multi-bids) when you are suddenly blessed in a round with a strong hand of cards. Other rounds be content with small gains and small losses. Update 4. When to play your 19? Does another player have the 20? Makes me nervous. Update 5. If you have one or none of suit X, and middling set of trump cards, bid for suit X, capture them with your trump cards. Outstanding card game.

How many Oh Hell variants does the world really need? Apparently one more. I [i]guess[/i] there's a slight difference between bidding for most cards taken in a suit (WBH) verses the number of tricks taken (Rage, Wizard, et al), but I would probably just prefer to play Wizard with the added value of the wizard/fool cards.

I am a big fan of trick taking games, but the cards of a suit,  rather than number of tricks, twist makes this really interesting.  I also really like the "+10 / -10" bonus card that the dealer has the choice to assign as good or bad every turn.

RATING: 10
Components: The fronts of the cards are beautiful and highly functional. The backs could be better differentiated between all the different types of cards; the cards could be linen-coated; and the game could come with a score pad.

Experience: This is my favorite trick-taking game, mostly because of its streamlined feel: three suits instead of four or five; trying to take the most or fewest of a color, rather than a specific number of cards or tricks. I find that the luck of the draw really evens out after ten or so rounds, leaving me with a slick, fun game about assessing my hand and reacting to unexpected plays. I would gladly play this any time.

So many trick-taking games, and many others that do more for me.  I get extremely annoyed when I get hands dealt to me that do best with "none-of-the-above" bids.  And I do get them.  A lot.  I'll *only* play this in the interest of game group harmony.

I didn't feel I had a lot of control in this game compared to other trick-taking games... or at least, the level of control was low compared to the large swings in scores. I'd like to try it again with the "one no bid" option to see if that helps.
Otherwise not much new here except for choosing the Good or Evil Bob's Hat.

Reprint of Wer Hat Mehr?. This is a nifty little trick-taking game, featuring only three suits. Players must bid before each hand begins on whether they will claim the most cards in any of the three suits, or the fewest cards at all. Bonus points are won or lost depending on whether you make your bid. Taking a 14 or 15 in a trick will earn you Bob&#039;s Hat, which is either worth +10 or -10 points. Lots to think about but not too heavy, this is a good game.

If you like trick taking games like Rook or Sticheln, this one is definitely worth checking out.  While offering little that's new, it is a very solid card game that exceeded my expectations.  This game is all about trying to meet your bid to get the most cards in none, some, or all of 3 different suites (hat types) by the end of the round.  The "Bob's Hat" cards add a little extra spice.

RATING: 4
There simply isn't enough information in the game for this to be a great trick-taking one for me. As the game goes on more cards are added giving you a bit more information but it is slow going. Add to that no variety in turn order can create a pretty harsh setup if you are playing to the right of an aggressive player. Not a bad game, but with so many other trick taking games out there it isn't one I would play again. If you like more unpredictable trick taking games, this may be a good one for you.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I suppose I would like this game a good deal more if I had some grasp of the strategy involved. It seemed like I did okay the first time I played, but this last session revealed just how ignorant I am of the finer points. Much of one's success depends on gaining control by taking at least one trick. If you cannot gain that control in some way, then it doesn't really matter how good a hand you have. The same strategies employed in traditional trick-taking games just don't seem to wash here. Luckily, I never got stuck with a -10 Bob's Hat; but by the same token, I never took the  10 Bob's Hat and kept it to the end of the hand.

First played July 23rd, 2007.  This is a quick learn (<5min), however it's a longer play.  Or at least for the four of us as it took about an hour.  I enjoyed it since it's a different variation of a trick taking game.  There is some strategy that isn't apparent at the start, however after a few hands you will get some of the ideas.  It has a good balance of luck and strategy (for what it is).  It's a good change of pace type of trick taking game that would be nice to play every once in a while to mix things up.  There are 3 suits and a no trump suit.  Trump (or no trump) is drawn from a deck of four cards by the start player.  Each player decides if he will take the most of any one suite (or more) and/or the least amount of cards starting with the dealer.  Cards are 1-20.  You play 10 rounds with 5 to 14 cards each.  Also the 14 and 15 are marked with a hat.  The last player to take a hat card, gets the bonus of   or - 10 depending on what the dealer chose.  It's can be frustraiting since you can have a 18 or 19 and think it might be good in a 5 hand round and someone has the 20.

Trick taking games are the bread and butter of my collection.  I just can't seem to get enough of them.  Let's go ahead and toss Where's Bob's Hat? in as one of my new favorites.  I really like how, as the game continues, more cards are dealt out making bids more important.  Bidding that you'll get the least tricks is worth only five points and if you miss out, big whoop...you lose five points.  However, mess up your bid in round 12, you're going to be losing 16 points.  Great trick taking game!

I quite like trick-taking games where one has to estimate what they'll take. But I don't like this one that much. You can be dealt a hand that can't win any of the bids (including fewest), but you are still stuck making a bid. There is some fun to be had, but I prefer other games of this genre, including several I didn't need to buy a special deck to play.

This game is a trick-taking game, a sort I haven't any previous experience with.  It took me some time to catch on a little, but once I did I enjoyed it more.  I didn't like having to predict which cards I might take the most of, though.  And I felt I was playing pretty blindly when it came to what cards to lead with.  More experience would lead to a better understanding of the game, but I feel no particular eagerness to play again.

As with traditional ‘Up And Down The Road’, chaotic, but fun. Being forced to make a bid on a hand with an even spread between suits, ranged from high to low, is hard. Most hands I feel like I’m flying along on a wing and a prayer, at the mercy of how the cards fall. But the game did generate decent after-the-fact moan chatter. It's too long for what it is though which limits replay.

Interesting twists to this type of trick-taking, such as the shifting bonus/penalty of Bob's hat and declaring the most CARDS you will win rather than number of tricks. But the scoring is too negative for such a chaotic game; Canyon does it better.

Nice Oh Hell, Wizard variant that is easier for new players.  Rather than bidding an exact number of tricks, the player need only bid the suit(s) that he will take the most cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Nothing really special here, just a three suit trick taking game.  The various bidding choices add some interest but the Bob's Hat mechanic is totally flawed. Due to the lack of control in this game, making your bid is very problematic. Except in unusual circumstances (and you better check your cards and think twice) a -10 risks going down 10 relative to ALL the other players while a +10 risks going down 10 relative to only ONE player; always use the +10.  Last place may use the -10 as a desperation move, but that is playing 'not to lose' instead of playing to win. The total points added to the game with that card may be a very large fraction of a given score, I'd prefer to play without it.  Essentially it's gimmick for gimmick's sake.

So many (much) better card games, this one just doesn't cut it.

RATING: 7
1 play, 4er

Feels like a simplified/twisted take on Wizard:
- only 3 suits (1-20)
- trick-taking game, random trump suit (or new trump)
- on hand x, deal (4 + x) cards per player
- there are Bob's Hats icons on the 14s and 15s; the dealer chooses whether they are worth after cards are dealt
- starting with dealer, players bid only the color suit you think you will take the most cards in (or bid you'll take the fewest cards); score points:
... failing bid = -5 pts
... making bid on color = 5 + (cards in color taken)
... making bid for fewest cards = (number of cards dealt this hand)

The 14/15 hat thing seems random at first, but you can definitely try to plan around that. And you don't have to do exact bids -- awesome!

I messed up with this game.  We rent a house once a year on the beach where my family, wifes family, and everyones kids get together for a week of fun.  At night we end up playing games.  I brought this game out for the first time too late in the evening.  They didn't quite get it not by fault of the game but rather I chose the wrong time to introduce this.  There is a really good game here but my family was underwhelmed so it never hit the table again.

A very nice Oh Hell variant, that plays excellently with just three. Much control, without the loss of interaction. Probably one of my favourite trick-taking games with three (together with Schnäppchen Jagd, Cosmic Eidex and The Bottle Imp).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
[RGG 2002 edition] {Card; trick-taking, bidding; optimal 3p} It's just an average trick-taking game. Other than the Bob's Hat, there are no game elements, when compared to other trick-taking games. The goal condition is too easy for my taste - a player needs to only predict which trump(s) he can get the most or that he gets the fewest cards, not the exact number. I like Sieben Siegel more for similar concepts. The Bob's Hat adds dynamic and fun to the game. It's more exciting if only "-10" is used.

It's getting better with 4-5 players, which players have to compete for the goals; otherwise it's too easy to achieve a goal. 

The illustration of the cards is boring and irrelevant to the theme. The illustration of the hat is better but it's not coherent with other cards. The card back of players' bidding cards is very dull! (I don't like the blue patterns.)

Bob's Hat is a bidding trick-taking game in the vein of Wizard, but a bit more silly and overall less fun.  This game tends to run way too long as well.  I will play Wizard any time over Bob's Hat.

Sold in my game auction December 2009

初心者のインストには丁度良いかもしれないが、続けてプレイしたくはどうしてもならない。シンプル過ぎるのがキズなのかも。

This game absolutely shines with three players. Always challenging and entertaining.

RATING: 8.5
Rating for the 3-player game. Rating drops a point for each player added, due to the lack of control that is induced. Still, I won't turn down a game at any number.

Not quite the same as Where's Bob's Hat, as there are no hat cards. Haven't acually played this- I was able to get a used copy of the original edition cheap on ebay, so I picked it up. Ugly, U-G-L-Y cards...

Good trick-taking game.  Each hand feels a little different, and the game gets better as it plays.

Better than the whimsical appearance would have lead me to believe. After just two plays, I could see what all the hype is about. A wild ride for trick taking card players.

A card game by Alan Moon.  No plays yet.  Given to Ben Lott.

The game seems a little counter-intuitive, what with the weird scoring and the varying number of cards per hand.  When it comes to trick-taking games, there are many, many better games out there.

This is a painfully fun game. Painful because it is often a struggle just to avoid losing points on any given hand. But fun because you get to watch your competitors going down in flames with you. :)

Trick taking with a slight difference.  Can plop on opponents which is always good.

Our group likes wizard a lot. But this stupid game? nobody.

Played once (with 4 players). A possibly interesting whist variant, but it didn't work for us.

Only played with 3. Easier to play  and learn than many trick taking games, yet lots of fun.

Owned, but my copy came all messed up.  Badly printed card backs and missing cards.  Jay said he'd send me another copy.

Juego de bazas en el que los jugadores deben apostar en que pintas tendrán mayoría y en cuales minoría.

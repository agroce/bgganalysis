Role selection, auction, and press your luck with some light pirate themes.  It's pretty solid, but you need the right group who can absorb the rules quickly and start thinking about the tactics/strategy.  Non-gamers might get how to go through the motions, but they won't pick up on what you are trying to do.

RATING: 3
Didn't really do it for me.  Took longer than it should, and while it has some decent mechanics it just gets really spiteful really quickly.  Also, if you bow out early you're just stuck waiting until everyone finishes so you can do scoring.

RATING: 6.5
+ variable player power
+ easy to setup and play (just a deck of cards some coins and the characters sheets)
+ mess with your opponents in all sort of ways possible
+ up to 8 players

- some luck in the game (the drawing and the effects of the cards and all the stealing of coins between the players throughout the game)
- usually there's player elimination in the game (whoever has the black spot loses regardless of how many coins he has), that's kind of lame.
- the game takes more time to play than it should.
- some roles are almost always better than others.
- not much control. Very chaotic.

Great little push-your-luck game or screw-your-neighbor game.

If you never like pirate games try this little beauty!!  You will love being a pirate after this game.

There are a series of cards that you play each hand rapidly on your voyage changing the various rolls you might play as power struggles dictate.

You role will give you certain sneaky skills that might when you more or less booty.

Pay the monkey... get a card...  Got a good card?  screw your neighbor!!

ARRRRGGHH!!

Simple role-selection game with a pirate theme. A lot of people say that this replaces citadels, but I would have to disagree. The hidden information element is nicely executed here though, and the push-your-luck aspect is interesting too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This was pretty fun, if totally chaotic. I won almost accidentally, when someone stole the Black Spot from me without my even realizing it. It's fun to unload bad coins onto other people, and it's amusingly annoying to have one unloaded onto you. In fact, it seems like unless you Cut & Run early you are almost guaranteed to have the Black Spot foisted onto you during the last turn. Fortunately, the game is so lighthearted that I couldn't imagine any resentment over it. I probably still prefer Citadels to this, but it's a nice variant.

In the family of chaotic role selection games, this is probably my favourite one to date. It has a clear direction (get points, avoid the black curse), a time limit (there are only so many coins in the bag), quick role selection (it is done publicly and is a minority of the actions in a round, as opposed to a majority), and take that that is universal (we will all be stealing from each other each round) and not too punishing (nobody will be losing their turn as a result of it). The cards are also enjoyable in that using them to harm others costs you end game points, a trade off which keeps people from using them excessively to harm others.

Ugh, definitely not my type of game. It’s push-your-luck and take-that all in one game with a heavy dose of planning required. That’s the killer right there for me in a game – don’t make me spend time planning and then have that all undone in an instant anyway. Way too much work and time to render that type of experience. I mean, I get it that it's just supposed to be silly and shouty, but if that's the case, give me Incan Gold where I don't have to spend nearly as much time thinking.

While the rules are a tiny bit more complicated than I'd prefer out of a filler game and there is a chance for some random luck leading to a defeat, it's got a fun combination of roll selection, bluffing, and luck-pushing elements and is certainly a game I would play again.

But the more people you play and different characters are in the game it gets really ineresiting.

I really thought I'd love this game, I was gonna buy it based on theme alone and a video review, but after a play at GenCon I'm glad I held off. The game isn't bad, but some roles are so much better than others that it'll always be the same used over and over until the end when players need to unload black spots. The powers of the monkey cards are very unbalanced.

Somewhat disappointed with my first play. Too much to keep track of -- so many of Jacque's cards flying around. And once you cut and run, you may be waiting a *long* time before the game ends. Doesn't really seem worthwhile to cut and run, either, given how many cards target the runner. And you don't have that high a chance of ending up with black spot if you stick around. Meh. Play #2 went much better (with 4 of us playing instead of 7). Took twenty minutes and with so few, a much higher chance of getting the black spot.

I really disliked this, and I'm starting to think that Smirk and Dagger Games just aren't for me. I stayed away from this game for a long time because it seemed too similar to Libertalia. In actuality, it reminded me more of Pirates vs. Dinosaurs...at least the final third of the game. All you do is draw coins, steal coins, and play cards on each other. Then you decide when you're ready to be done with the game. This game is complete garbage, and it's indicative of the worst kinds of take that games out there.

RATING: 5
A nasty take-that game of piratey treasure hoarding. I like the flow of the game and the idea of looking out for the black spot. Role selection is pretty tight and it's fun to get into the mindset of your opponents. That being said, I think the game falls apart a little with the action cards. It seems the game tries to create balance by making the way more powerful cards be worth more money if you hold on to them instead of playing them, but I don't like the wild swings of fate every time I draw from the deck. Still, this can be fun for a short time if not taken too seriously. Just not one I'll be adding to my collection.

This is the type of game I don't enjoy.  It was too long for what it was.  The mechanism for ending the game is really fiddly (You can choose to end the game on the first round).  The Jacques cards are a tad annoying, for me.

The art and components are quite good.  Other than that there is nothing positive I have to say about this game.

A game about passive-aggressive pirates who vie for high rank and lots of gold, but not the piece of gold that has moldy curses all over it. Very fun backstabbery and bidding game. Light-med weight party game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun little pirate game that has some similarities with Citadels. A lot of backstabbing and some push your luck aspect. You cannot do any deep strategy because you cannot defend yourself from the cards and roles effects, but you have to play very tactically if you want to win the game and there are enough meaningful decisions based by the roles available and the cards in your hand to keep you interested. Is not much about luck, it`s more about if the other players are giving you a hard time or leave you alone. If you have a reputation of a good board game player (in general), like me in my group, you don`t have many chances to win this game. The playing of Pirate Code cards is a little bit inelegant because the interaction between them can be very odd. The quality of components and the artwork are outstanding but I have a problem with the size of the role cards which are way too big for no reason and I cannot find any sleeves for them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A too-chaotic role selection game strapped to a take that engine. It's fun enough, but it's one of those games that just loud and confusing for the sake of being loud and confusing. It's a simple game but I felt players were constantly asking for clarifications. It was cool, but it was a little too wide open.

The Smirk & Dagger treatment adds cards to flesh it out from a filler to a more filling appetizer (or dessert).

Good push-your-luck game with bidding elements. The players are greedy pirates about to share the plunder and everybody wants to get the biggest cut. But...there are cursed coins which mean the doom of the pirate who ends the game with them. Every turn the players use their role's power to hoard more coins or steal them from the fellow pirates. Then at the end of each turn, everybody bids to get a new role. It is very enjoyable but it really shines once after a couple of games everybody gets to know the roles. At that point, strategies start to surface and the game really takes off. Loved it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a group take-that/press-your-luck style game with special roles.  Each round players will take on one of 8 different roles, each with special abilities, take coins from a bag, steal coins from other pirates, and then decide whether to continue playing or take their money and run.  The caveat is that there are 2 black spots in the bag and having one of these prevents you from being able to win at all.

This was a neat sounding game but it just doesn't work as well as I would have liked.  First of all, there are these pirate code cards and too many of them are essentially "I win" cards while others are kind of worthless.  My first game of this a player played a card that allowed him to take a coin from the bag for each player and hand them to whoever he liked.  This also drained the bag which ended the game so taking a black spot out of the bag means he gets to decide who just automatically loses.  I also don't think playing with the max of 8 is ideal.  It's just as long as with fewer players while you wait for all 8 players to take their turns but the number of rounds is a lot fewer so individually everyone gets to do less and this makes for a less interesting experience.

I think I might be done with these sort of group take-that, almost party-style games, altogether (Although I still really like Cutthroat Caverns but there is a lot more "game" there).  They just devolve into luck/king making experiences where most of the time no amount of strategy (while still there) actually makes a difference.

RATING: 8
I love games that are quick to learn, relatively short in length, and can play with a lot of players. Dread Curse is every one of those. At 30-45 minutes and up to 8 players, this can be pulled out at the end of a party or family dinner night for a lot of laughs, some frustrated fist-pounding, and a ton of fun. Rotate through a selection of ranked pirate characters, each with its own special cheat abilities, to accumulate as much wealth as you can in your treasure stash. Draw from the pile, steal from your neighbor, your friend, your spouse, your kids...all is fair game as long as you amass the largest fortune! However, get caught with one of the two cursed Black Spots in your stash, and you're done for. 

First, draw your coins as instructed on your character card. Second, steal! Steal from the Captain or from the player to your right or left. And the fun part? You have to steal...as in you can't not steal. Next, pay the monkey for a card if you want to. Then decide whether you want to cut and run. This means you don't have a Black Spot and you think you have enough treasure to get you the win once the game is over. At first I was worried this would force people to sit out of the game too much, but not so. It is a very exciting, even nerve-wracking feature of the game (do you stay or do you go?). Lastly, reconvene as a group of scallywags to determine who will be the next captain and to choose your character for the next round. 

Some of my favorite pirate cheats include the First Mate's ability to give a coin to another player (get rid of a Black Spot or a Lead Slug!), the Bosun's ability to draw a Pirate's Code card instead of a coin, and the Pilot's ability to look at two coins then choose one (find out where those Black Spots are!).  

All of this is just hitting the surface of the game. With 50 Pirate's Code cards that allow players to cheat at different phases of the game, there is almost a game within a game. See if you can steal, cheat, and bluff your way to victory! I love how the push-your-luck aspect is at the long-term, entire game level, not on a turn-by-turn basis. Overall, this is a very fun game with a very high replay value deserving of a solid 8.

With a better design (the red text is a mess and impossible to read across a table) there's a decent party type game here. The cards a bit too take-that heavy for my tastes, but this was a lot better than it looked like it was going to be.

RATING: 5
A bit too long for the amount of luck involved. There are far too many pirate's code cards and phases can take a while resolving all the ones players choose to play. These cards can be _extremely_ powerful and game-changing, and it's complete luck as to who draws them. Would be fine in a 15 minute game, but this can easily go more than an hour with a higher player count.

RATING: 6
Take that game with lots of luck. Could be fun in the right group, but I have better games to scratch that itch. You'd have to play this game on at least semi-regular basis to remember all the cards. Constantly checking what role does what is tedious in a game as light as this.

Needs templating, there are for example references to both Jacques and monkey. Timing rules of cards are unclear, and cards are generally annoying.

Some game-destroying rules/cards/abilities in this that really shouldn't have passed testing.

Given that Dread Curse is a distant relative of Citadels, my rating for Citadels - whatever it is - is too high.

The only reason Dread Curse gets a "3" rating (instead of a 2) is that players can drop out at any time - even on the first turn.

Sure, you're only supposed to quit if you think you're winning.  Trust me, though. I've definitely won if I'm allowed to bail out after only 5 minutes, regardless of who has the most points at the end.

Great art, nice concept, but didn't quite click with my group. Not sure why not.

This game is a bit disappointing. I like it for what it is, but it is less tension and more laid back than expected. I thought this would be more of a push your luck type game, instead it is not so much push your luck, but positioning yourself at the right time. It is an ok game.

Thematic quick filler. Role selection with a pirate theme. Whats not to like?

This one falls into the party game bracket, with a lot of bluffing and screwing over of everyone else. Some really clever mechanisms for determining the Captain (but also giving players information) and takes 20 to 30 minutes.

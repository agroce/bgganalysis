It's like playing Crazy Eights with three radios blaring different stations. Seriously, the card game is really simple but the music aspect did not appeal to me although I understand why it would attract some people.

RATING: 8
Pretty damn cool, when the mix hits just perfectly it's kind of a sublime marriage of analog and digital. 2v2 has enough of a game there to not be an afterthought (though it certainly isn't insanely deep) and freestyle is very fun even by itself.

Got a two player game with my wife last night. While to call it competitive is a stretch, the music is generally pleasant and you can make a few choices. Better as a party ice breaker. Established game groups need not bother . The music will eventually, or is already dated and will lose appeal eventually.

More of a toy than a game.  Freestyle is fun but the thin game modes aren't worth it.  I love the idea but I'm not sure if I will keep it once the novelty wears off.

As an object to play with, this is a really incredible thing. The way the device creates mash-ups is really great, and I've had a lot of fun toying around with it on freestyle mode.

As a game, I've played it in cooperative party mode, and the experience there is pretty meh. It's a speed reaction game of slapping down cards according to directions you're given, and the real-time nature of it means you aren't really enjoying the mash-ups being created, which is really where the enjoyment all stems from. We had more fun just creating mash-ups as a group in freestyle mode after giving the party game a go.

The head to head battles are likely the better game, although I'm only familiar with the rules, and haven't played that mode yet. Just by not being real-time, it has to be better, as you can take a moment to enjoy your creations between turns, without being hurried to do anything.

Overall, this thing is a real joy to play with, and a nice relaxing way to play with music. You can definitely stumble into things that make your ears bleed a bit, but by and large, the mash-ups are pretty consistently good!

Fun game to bring out to those who love music and creativity.  There's a cooperative and competitive game mode for up to 4 players.  The card technology and free-downloadable app in this game make the theme and gameplay allow the players to become immersed in the game right from the get-go.

RATING: 7.7
As a game, DropMix is very lackluster. As a piece of hardware that seamlessly blends disparate song track instrumentations? Ridiculously awesome. I've spent a ton of time just sitting and making mixes. It's a very satisfying experience that alters the way you approach and listen to music.

RATING: 8
The card game mechanic is very simple to learn, and doesn't have much depth...but the technological advancement is still groundbreaking.  The mixes can be a great musical product or cringe-worthy combos...but that's part of the fun.  We've played over 20 times since opening on Christmas and always play a few rounds, minimum. This technology could pave the way for many interesting advancements in combining digital and analog gaming, while still preserving the tactile feel of playing an actual board/card game.

RATING: 8.5
Strangely simple and deep, with really awesome mashups and the app's equalizer function taking it from an enjoyable 6.5 rating to an 8.5. I haven't been able to stop playing. Harmonix absolutely nailed the graphic design in both the cards and the app. Wish there were explicit rules for deckbuilding or drafting, but it's easy enough to create your own. For a 2 player clash I went with "Draw 6, split into 2 groups of 3, your opponent chooses first. Switch roles and repeat 9 more times for a total of 30 cards."

As a party game it's enjoyable but gimmicky, you aren't going to be playing it all night. But as a toy in freestyle mode my kid loves it!

The game isn't great, but as a toy it's super fun and the accompanying "game" lets adults play with it without feeling embarrassed. Great for parties, the co-op mode is actually a bit challenging once the drinks have been flowing for a bit.

While not a particularly deep game (at least at this time, they're developing it as an LCG so things may evolve), it's is insanely fun, family friendly, and almost infinitely replayable!

Fun and neat music based game. There's a freestyle mode where you can just put different parts of songs down and then game will mix them together for you (a lot of them actually sound really good together). Beyond that, there's a versus mode for 2 or 4 players as well as a party (co-op) mode for 1 - 5 players.

Very light, easy to play, and involves music. If this sounds appealing to you, then you'll probably like it.

RATING: 6
Clash Mode is a perfectly serviceable entry/party game, Party Mode is... okay. Freestyle is just a neat way to pass the time.

Creating and saving mixes, even if I'm not a fan of the original songs (to put it nicely), is the best part of this game. Nodding along to the beats, and the smile you get when one sounds great, elevates DropMix from being a forgettable mass-market game.

If you can get it for half off, take a look. If a friend owns a copy, save your money, visit them often, and enjoy the experience.

Completely blew my mind!  I got this game as an early Christmas surprise and I knew absolutely nothing about it prior...WOW!  This is an amazing experience and it's so much fun just letting my inner DJ loose!  

I absolutely love all the features and modes of play included with this game as well.  My New Year's Resolution is to get as much content for this as possible!  :)  Even if I have trouble later down the line getting what I want for it though, I am more than satisfied with what I have so far.  Even with the 60 cards available to me right now, it's still a ton of fun and has lots of light strategical play and replayability.

This game takes cards with NFC chips in them and allows you to create music mashups. It's a ton of fun and has accounted for some of the greatest parties I've ever thrown (we throw dance parties and let people be the DJ with this). It's a truly unique experience. There IS an actual 2-4 player game in there somewhere too, but we just always end up in free play because that's the best way to experience the music.

This may be slightly more of an activity than an actual game. In fact I would rate it higher as an activity, as it it really really fun, and super compelling. 
They game might be a bit meh really. I like that they included both cooperative and competitive variants, but I would rather just sit around and make music with it. These absolute geniuses should just sit back and take my money as I will probably be purchasing every single expansion regardless of how expensive they are. This thing is an absolute mesmerizing joy.

The music stuff makes it fun, but there isn't much of a game here (so far). The real time aspect of party mode means that I don't much enjoy it. Will definitely give it another try with louder speakers however so I can feel the bass that I add to the mix!

As a competitive game, it seems to be fairly weak.  Coop(party mode) is okay and has some excitement since it is timed.  As something to play around with in freestyle mode, it's pretty amazing.  So, overall, not much of a game - which is how I rated it.  As a toy, it's great!

RATING: 5
It's a fun, simple game that is perfect for the mass market audience it's aiming for.  Easy to teach, amazing technology, and some interesting decisions to be made that isn't always straightforward.  As game though, somewhat mediocre.  You're buying this game for your love of technology and music, not the in-depth gameplay.

There are three modes in this: Clash, Party, and Freestyle.

Clash is best described as "Area Control Uno" with consequences attached to it. It's a race to 21 points and you do this by placing cards in specific colored areas to score points or use white FX cards that could potentially get you more points via rule breaking effects.  The catch is that each card has a Volume Level from 1 to 3 and you can only place a card in the colored areas if your card's volume level is equal or higher.  However, it is possible to lose cards via the Dropmix button which removes all opponent cards equal to the volume level it lands on, with volume level 3 bearing the most risk.  This simple mechanic forces an interesting system where risk management plays a major role since losing cards means losing points.  It's interesting for the casual audience Dropmix tries to aim for.

Party is a real-time co-operative game where the players fulfill "audience requests" by placing the cards down.  It's essential Go Fish, only you still have the follow the rules of the board (e.g. colors and volume levels), which is a twist that works well.  You also get scored based on how fast and accurate your team is.

Finally, Freestyle is exactly what the name implies.  You simply drop cards onto the board to create mixes of music.  You can also change the beats per minute (BPM) and what musical note is played.  You can save your mix, convert it to a video file, and share it via social media sites.

This is a great alternative to the numerous boring party games like Telestrations, Cards Against Humanity, Secret Hitler, Concept, Exploding Kittens, Monikers, or other games that rely on "miscommunication" as the main theme.  At least in Dropmix, there is some thinking involving in placing cards to get a good combo going.  If you really want to get into it, you can even create a custom deck and the App will verify if your deck is legit or not, which is a nice touch.

RATING: 9
the mixes get a little samey after a while, but that will help when there are more cards added to the game. Actual gameplay and strategy are passable, but not what makes the game enjoyable - meaning that it only gets to a 9 rating because of the novelty and the technology involved. Actual gameplay is more like a 6 or a 7.

+ Ouroboros, Astro, Derby, Mirrors, Bomb, and Flawless Playlist Packs.
+ Discover Packs 1 and 2. 

First impressions: I'm rating this as an experience more than a game, but boy is it fun. I just spent about 2 hours playing it with my six year old son and he love it. The clash and party modes are definitely cool and work well but this shines in freestyle mode just mixing different beats. Can't wait to collect all the cards.

The game is simple to set up and simple to play. The rules for vs play are simple enough for anyone to pick up and play. I'm not a huge CCG fan, but the strategy for winning is deep enough that each match feels challenging. Also, the in game tutorial is really good at describing the rules. If  you're into solitaire play, it is a BLAST to mix different types of music for fun! Even adding in songs you don't is great because you never know how it will change the mix. It is one of the best examples of using technology in board games.

Dropmix is an incredible piece of tech. It's on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for. Every card you play onto the board contributes to the music mix you create with components (vocals, melodies, drums, rhythms) of different well-known songs.

It's great to mess around with as a toy in Freestyle mode, and the 1v1 Clash mode is surprisingly tactical for its simplicity. It's very approachable and instantly addictive. You will constantly hit upon mixes that set the room on fire, which you can easily save through the app. Saved mixes can be shared via links that go back to the app, or exported as videos you can post anywhere. Very cool!

Clash can be played 2v1 or 2v2, and the casual Party mode supports up to 5 players. But for the best experience I recommend 1v1 Clash. As a matter of fact, I enjoy playing Clash mode solo, against myself, just to enjoy the the build and flow of the music mix. The music that is generated is so intriguing, even people not playing the game can get a high level of enjoyment out of it.

A proper setup for this game, which includes a smartphone, the board and cards, batteries for the board (not included), and a powered speaker (also not included, but a must to best enjoy the music!) can be a handful to tote around. Reliance on audio also means you can't play this in overly noisy venues or very quiet ones, so keep that in mind when you take Dropmix to your local game-up.

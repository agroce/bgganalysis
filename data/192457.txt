Excellent game BUT don't buy it if you're looking for an easy-to-learn war game. The 4 factions have different playing styles and some of them are much harder to play. So you're gonna have to play A LOT to win with the machines, but it's worth it ;)

+ Secret Objective Cards.

Cry Havoc really is one of those game that gets better over time. I was very excited to play it when I bought the game, but the first couple of times I was actually disappointed by it. I felt like I didn't get to do enough and that was very frustrating. I simply couldn't wrap my head around it. It took me a few of plays to realize how to properly play it and how to get the most out of the 15 actions you get over the course of the game. Now I really can say that there's an insane amount of depth in this box.

There's a lot of tactics to be explored in this game and I really feel that it's really hard to master them. The concept of spending cards as resources to take actions is very simple... and yet the management of those few resources and the timing of those action is so important and key to win. You really need to learn how to set up your next big move and when to take it. You might be able to have an amazing turn and get a bunch of stuff all together, but if you didn't set up that move right and you didn't take turn order and other possibilities under consideration you might find yourself loosing your advantage just as fast as you gained it. I just love it!

This huge game-play depth is what makes the game so fascinating and it's one of the reasons why I want to come back to play Cry Havoc: I want to learn how to play it better. Right there you have therefore a great amount of replayability, which can only be enhanced by the different factions that provide different play-stiles and some extra flavor to the whole experience. The amazing production values do the rest.

At the same time I have a few minor issues with Cry Havoc. First the game takes a long time to teach, because you have to go through all the buildings and special abilities of every faction. It's not a deal breaker, but it's definitively a chore. Second, I feel like you don't get the full experience of the game with less than 4 players. I enjoy Cry Havoc much more when every faction is being played and there's that back-and-forth between them, when every player has to make sure that the others are not going to run away with the victory. Third and last, this game always leaves me wanting more. I wish there was a bigger variety of buildings and powers available for every faction... and that there were more factions to chose from, for that matter. I'm sure however that all of this extra content will eventually be added by expansions. I can't wait for that!

So, summing up, I find Cry Havoc to deserve the high praise that it has been receiving. It's a clever game with innovative mechanisms, great strategical and tactical depth and incredible production values. With a little bit of extra content I can see this game becoming really one of my favorites. Thumbs up!

RATING: 8
This is a good game. I traded it because the rules - and rulebook - prevent you from being able to play the game. Review [thread=1648276]here[/thread] 

The Battle Board is a great design. The flavour is fun. The components are top notch. The deckbuilding is useful and makes sense. 

However, there are lots of rules intepretations that follow a certain logic but really aren't intuitive. The way Trogs play in 2-3 player games, the way Battle Regions become 'locked', the strange Turn and Scoring rules, etc. 

What this means is that it's too hard to teach someone to actually just play. Then when you fight through the corner cases, winning and losing feels more procedural than it should be. It's about timing in a finnicky way, not the culmination of some grand strategic movement or tactical opening. 

I was really excited to play this game, and I think it definitely will appeal to those who are looking for the next Nexus Ops/Cyclades/Kemet/Blood Rage iteration, but for me it was just too much work.

RATING: 5
Another nice basic area occupation wargame without dice. Nice production. Nice minis and components. 

The cards with powers and building for extra firepower are all very nice touch. But nothing new. It's just presented in a different way. 

The deck building aspect also adds little to overall gaming as the amount of cards are usually Low, power combi gets regenerated quite quickly so it hits the table really fast. Making the game play shorter as these combos start to get churned up. 

Overall a good introductory game that is beautiful to look at and plays easily. 

However, to a vet wargamer. There is really very little here that entice.

RATING: 7
Rating after 1x 4-player game.  Area control, combat centric game that delivers some interesting game play - most especially the Combat, which centres around an innovative battle mechanic.  First play felt a little slow and disjointed as we all came to terms with the factions and their skills.  Playing the Trogs, I didn't fully recognise the strategy until late in the game and ended-up well behind and unable to catch-up.  The game does allow players to be smashed, with little hope of recovery, but there's a lot more for me to explore.  Great components and artwork with lots of little ambiguities that aren't all covered in the rules, which was a little frustrating.  I'm still keen to try the other factions and to adopt different strategies - time will tell if my initial assessment changes.

Excellent game, feels fast but involved.  However....the rule book is ridiculous - so many important rules not expanded on or explained.   Would have preferred the FFG style separate how to play/Rules AtoZ setup.

After 3 plays - game needs a little balancing, potentially an expansion can sort this.  Hidden goal would also be helpful to keep players who are further back on the score track interested in the game.

After almost 10 plays the game holds really well. A lot of different strategies and pact to victory. The interplay between the different skills is significant and radically changes each game. I play with the events mini expansion, they do not add much but can become important in case of close calls (although most of my games end with a significant VP difference between first and second or last).

A light war/area control game of sorts. The rules are not particularly well written and a lot of questions come up during game play that the rules never address which sums up most of Portal Games' rule books. There seem to be some balance issues with the factions themselves. Combat resolution is the really interesting part of this game but it's not enough to carry an otherwise uninteresting game. Neat idea but I'm not sure it is what the hype built it up to be. Sold in FallCon 30 auction.

Cry Havoc is an absolutely stellar area control game (probably my favorite game mechanic). The battle system is what drew me in and keeps me playing- it's entirely tactical, and requires sacrifice. 

The component quality is out of this world- no other game I own is anywhere near the level of Cry Havoc.

I won't describe the title as a must own- many people seem to dislike the previously mentioned battle system. But it is a solid title with immense replay value.

Preliminary Rating 
Some interesting design at work. Production quality is actually deceptive - looks luxurious, but the designs are a bit clumsy and cartoonish. Likewise the board is a a bit of an eyesore, especially once festooned with tokens and bits. However, the assymetry  seems well implemented - factions play in a fundamentally similar way, but with their uniqueness expressed in a few clever ways. Balance is always the question for this type of game though. The big question mark I have is the very tight number of moves. Seems like a game this constrained won't really have an ebb and flow - you kind of blob out and that's the end of the game. I wonder if more turns wouldn't add to the game?

Cry Havoc is a game that could've been designed by Eric Lang (it's reminiscent of Chaos in the Old World), but instead has spawned by the minds of three designers, two Poles and an American.
It's a hybrid design: it's ameritrash but has an eurogame's area control element.
The four factions are very different, and somewhat channel strategy without necessarily forcing it.
The combat system is ingenious and definitely a novelty, with interesting decisions and a pleasant tension between the need to play cards for actions and keeping them for the battles.
A very interesting piece of design, with a few unique features, in a genre that is becoming a bit crowded lately.

Initial Impression: I have to admit that I'm enjoying games released by Portal. This game has many things that I crave for in a game; asymmetical powers for factions, nice quality components, interesting decisions, and conflict. I particularly enjoy the "deckbuilding" and upgrade aspect of the game. Also, the battleboard was well done, with the cardplay adding a bluffing aspect and uncertainty to the battles. My niggles with the game were few. I believe that the one thing missing with the factions' asymmetry was a lack of differing victory conditions. Since the VPs were linked to crystals, in our play of the game we all used fairly similar tactics. Of course, this could simply have been our inexperience. Speaking of crystals, I found this to be the most fiddly aspect of the game. Overall, I enjoyed my play of the game and believe that I need to try out all the factions before I form a more formal opinion about the game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.75
For most of my friends, Blood Rage has overshadowed Cry Havoc because Cry Havoc is that much more brain burny.  And as I do have some people prone to AP, it does seem to come out more in Cry Havoc.  However, I personally absolutely love the asymmetry and the way things fight.  It's got meat and feels distinctly different enough from Blood Rage that they both scratch different itches for me.  I will win with the Pilgrims one of these days!

I love this game! Nice quality miniatures. I did paint mine though. There are some quirks with the rules which prove to be frustrating but once you know what you're doing the game rolls smoothly. 

This game has a little of everything. Area control, deckbuilding, variable faction powers, combat, and a smidge of worker placement. Nice quality components. Heavy box. Thick cardboard. My favorite part is the structure abilities which can affect the combat in the game which is my second favorite aspect. The combat has 0 randomness. You know exactly what's going to happen at every step of the process. Choices can be hard. 

Very much looking forward to the expansions and new factions.

I really like how crazy this game is.  Every time I think I've got one of the factions figured out, something happens in the next game to pull the rug out from under me.  Next to the COIN games, this is probably the most asymmetric game I've played.  The theme is great, lot's of fun to play, great miniatures.

I'm initially giving this a 7 because it is just so unforgiving.  Unless everyone knows what they are doing, it really easy for someone to run away with the game.  I think this game might end up at and 8, especially if there is an expansion with new races.

A game that definitely requires multiple plays to fully appreciate so take my 6 with a grain of salt. It's got 4 very different factions which I appreciate. At it's core it's an area-control/combat game in the same vein as Bloodrage. The Trogs are the easiest to play and I won with them in my one game so far. The Machines definitely seem to be the hardest so I'd be interested to see an experienced person play them and see how they do. The reason why it gets a low rating is just because the game just feels...clunky.

It's a pretty good and solid game that needs to play at least 5 times or more in order to think it through. There are a lot of tough decisions and it's very intense ! The battle system is quite unique and I would say it's the most interesting part of the game. It also has a little of deck building aspect which could make some people love or hate it. And after several gameplays, I can say it doesn't have any balance issue like many people and I first believe. It's just the matter of some factions are more difficult to play than the others and the some luck factor (events, exploration tiles...)

Overall, I enjoy it after some games. Give it a try and be patient with it then you will find yourself in the most intense battlefield that a board game can bring to your table.

I really enjoy this game, but I worry about the balance. If it's actually balanced is not the problem, but the perception by nearly everyone that it isn't is. I'm hoping the expansion will fix this a little. I also think it is only really balanced when being played 4 player.

update: 

I love it, I think it does a ton of things differently, which is what I think many people hate about it. It doesn't reward the 'one game only' experience, it rewards more the idea that you'll play this game a lot. It is a deckbuilder that totally isn't a deckbuilder. It is a dudes on a map game that totally doesn't manage to be that game. It gives you combat with no dice. It is, in that regard, truly amazing. 

On the other hand, many cards are phrased strangely, some rules are easily missed, and some structures and cards will need to be checked with errata to make sure they don't nearly mean something else entirely (which is why, I suspect, many people think the game is 'unbalanced'). I think the real big rule, that no cards or effects can effect an area that is locked in combat unless otherwise stated, is not in the rule book. But there's lots of small cards that have also been clarified (or errata'd) that you'll have to either remind yourself and remember every game, or do what I'm actually doing today which is hunting it all down, printing it out, and finding some way, and I don't know how, but some way, to attach it to the damn building because this is ridiculous. I would literally pay money at this point for just a box of reprinted cards and structures that have the errata info or the updated clarity on them. 

Also, I'm of the opinion that the game is only good 4 players. Playing the trogs as a weird 3rd party operator just never clicked for me. Mostly I think it's the fact that you have to play your own cards, but don't get the rewards? 

I've been hard on Portal after this game, maybe too hard sometimes on the forums here on BGG, but man if I don't feel bitter about all the extra work I have to do to make this game great (and to be clear, it is, really really great IMHO)

Also, I finally got the expansion to the table last night. We only got to play 1/5 rounds because of a combination of AP, questions, and faq lookups slowing us down, but I can honestly say I probably wouldn't play without it in the future. The game is overwhelming, what's one wafer thing mint on top of it all?

Good hybrid with an absolutely fantastic battle system that functions sort of like a little area control within area control.

Dig the asymmetry. Dig the deckbuilding and card play.

The game does seem like it's over a little too fast. You don't get to spread out very far and actions are extremely precious. The effects from tweaking your deck also are less impactful due to this. This is nice though because it keeps the time down so it's a tough tradeoff.

Reasons to like this game are the asymmetry and the battle system primarily.

RATING: 7.5
This is one of the better "dudes on a map" games I've played, and I've played quite a lot even though the genre doesn't particularly excite me. It's much better than Blood Rage, but not as good as Kemet.

What I like about the game is mainly the 4 asymmetric races, which all play very differently and have unique powers and playing styles. Sure, this means that you're kind of "forced" in a direction, but I don't mind as you still have lots of stuff to think about. I'm concerned that the factions don't seem totally balanced, at least at the lower player count, where the humans (if they have scouting) can be quite tough to beat; unless, of course, everybody knows this and are constantly attacking the Human player, which kind of sucks... Anyway, I do like how the Trogs are handled with less than 4 players, it actually works.

The game is quick as you only have between 12 and 15 actions (depending on whether the game is going to last 4 or 5 rounds, which you can influence in the very first round if you score lots of points). 12 actions is NOT a lot, so you need to plan carefully.

The battle system is very unique and works really well! I also like the hand management of your deck and that you're able to customize the deck by drawing cards from various stacks which all have certain benefits. The special abilities of some of the cards do seem too strong in battle I think (I'm especially thinking of Air Support), but overall it's fine.

Finally, the way scoring works is quite unique as well and makes the game stand out a little more. There aren't a ton of ways to score points (and for some of the factions even fewer), and this is usually something I like as you don't just get points for everything, but it also makes it a tight game. And, yes, the mini expansion with the bonus cards with end game points is a good idea, but it feels a little too random when one such card pops up during the final turn and awards points for certain areas which some players just so happens to control. Other than that I think it's a very good game, and I'm looking forward to try the various races.

I'm looking forward to memorable and engaging factions, a compelling narrative, rich graphics, and interesting new options in game play. What I have seen of the dice-less combat has piqued my interest, but as I am not the biggest fan of the direct combat style of games---I'll need a full immersive point of view to drive me deeper into the experience. Hope to play it perhaps at Origins before the GenCon release? Lots of interesting details coming out: interested in the decks for training, skills, and buildings;  dominance can end a game sooner? That's cool. Lots of things that sound fresh.

Clever Ameritrash game with an innovative combat mechanic. Really like the deck building combined with the area control. The different races to play are great in this game, some of the asymmetrical race powers seem awfully powerful.   Like any other combat game king making may be a factor, but I'll need to play more to come to any conclusion.

For what it is -- an asymmetrical, interactive, beer-and-pretzels game of area control and tactical maneuvering -- it hits the mark.  I can understand if people don't like it for any number of reasons, but there aren't many other games out there that can favorably compare to it, either.

I will concede, however, it does suffer from the same problem as Twilight Imperium -- there is a tendency to see rules where they aren't, primarily because of the number and complexity of different effects that occur as a result of the various player capabilities.  It's manageable at the moment, but I would be concerned if expansions started to come out for it.

For a first game - 2 player I rate this one an 8. We were still learning the rules and had no real strategy going on so I don't feel we got out of it what we could have.
However their is a huge amount of potential for this game and the components are stellar. I still had a great time so will revisit my rating after a few more plays.

RATING: 7
Almost better than Blood Rage. Great factions, cards, amazing battle system.

Update from 10 to 9: I have to admit there are some balance issues. Maybe it will disappear with experience. But if you are inexperienced and you are almost certainly going to lose as a hard faction against an easy one that's a problem. This can ruin 1st play experience. Because of this, I decrease the score to 9.

Update from 9 to 7:
Nothing special it is just declining in my eyes because of balance issues and my friends refused to play it. So I sold this game.

Placeholder rating of 7 after 2 games. I only enjoy it with 4 (which is fine) BUT I have two major problems with it and one minor, which I am hoping for the expansion to fix. Like many, I think the game needs the five rounds and do not like the shortening mechanism, and the pilgrims are fairly boring to me which causes the game to suffer for one player. Also, I would like to see some more movement options and more actions. The previews of the expansion look like they may address all of these issues at least partially. 

Can see this going up with the xpack as I LOVE the asymmetric factions, especially how the troggs are an indigenous species, and enjoy the unique battle system very much alongside the choice brought up by the dual use cards. I will likely house rule 5 card draws per turn instead of 4 and take out any negative event tokens on the track so the already limited supply of units can't be reduced that way.

Update: Sold this game off in favor of area control games that I prefer to it. There are some good qualities but I did not enjoy the game at 2 or 3 due to the troggs basically stifling interaction between your factions, but at 4 the pilgrims were a faction no one wanted to play because they were boring (my group is not a euro group)However, overall I still have to give this a "Pretty Good" rating because of how much I enjoyed exploring the different factions and trying out the battle system.

RATING: 8
I feel like there's a LOT to explore here. This is a real assymetrical game where every faction plays differently. Nothing is really obvious and the game seems to be deeper than some might have thought. Knowing all the minor rules well is required and creates paths for unusual plays, sadly a poorly written rulebook does not help and lots of questions emerged during our first game.

I like the action system very much, as I like the fact that cards can be used either to move/recruit/build or during the battle to change the outcome. You must plan ahead and decide whether you want to make your action stronger or to hold a card in order to use it when fighting. I like that every action is precious and you cannot waste them. Well, that may be stressful and I understand it won't appeal to everybody.  I like that little deckbuilding element and the whole terrain idea. I like a unique battle system where all 3 objectives are crucial; I really unappreciated the value of prisoners at first. I disagree that battles feel "scripted" and obvious(as I have seen such opinions) - we had a few that turned out to be really exciting where both players played 2-3 tactics cards and totally changed the initial result. I was afraid that due to the fact fighting the Trogs stops movement players will exclusively fight the neutral faction(I played 3p only) and not themselves. Thankfully a board is created wisely, where you can quickly get to the opposite corner of the map - well, this foreign planet, just like Earth, is not flat and it's well incorporated into the mechanics, allowing you to attack other players early.

Concerning the balance... I believe Cry Havoc IS balanced. Nevertheless it is obvious that there are races that are more intuitive and easy to play(Humans) as well as those harder, requiring knowing the game well(Machines). For some it will be a huge disadvantage that a game demands them to play a faction a few times before understanding it and having a chance to win. Those who like a steep learning curve will surely be pleased, but I can see why people who like their game "straight from the box" and obvious from the very beginning will be hugely dissapointed and frustrated. However, if you like discovering your faction and improving strategies then Cry Havoc may be a game for you. That's Chaos in the Old World's case - a game that requires a stale group of people who know the rules well and like to master the game.

It's a complicated game, there are a lot of different options to take. To enjoy it to the fullest, you need to know the capabilities of the different races. That will need at least 3 plays.

RATING: 8
Rating based on 4 games with 2-4 players. As the game is a-symmetrical, there is quite a learning curve to see what works and what doesn't for the various factions. So far, most games have resulted in landslide victories, however for various factions. So, apparently, there are no overpowered factions, but once you're ahead, it's quite hard to catch up. I like the game quite a bit, but it will not sufficient playtime and shelf space is limited, so decided to trade this away.

Very impressive components, and some clever mechanics. The result, sadly, is mediocre. A ten-turn game would be interesting, but it runs a maximum of five. (Sure, you could house-rule a longer game, but you'd have to fiddle with some of the rules. There are too many other games that don't require that to bother with this.)

With three players, the Human faction has a massive advantage due to their fast movement and ability to take over distant regions. This would likely be slowed down in a 4-player game, but not that much.

The unique combat system is a really neat idea. It would be a blast for combats with 7 or 8 units a side. Unfortunately, more than 3 units is very rare due to the limited movement and difficulty of reinforcing once a battle has been declared (you need a special card).

The rulebook deserves special mention. It's a mess. To be fair, there are not many unanswered questions, but a lot of the answers are very well hidden. Some rules are written in very faint text in sidebars. Others appear in the Clarifications section in the back. Some issues can be cleared up by reading the faction flavor text. The rules could have been a LOT better with just a little more editing.

To sum up, there's a lot of cool stuff in here, but most of it seems more appropriate for a 4-hour game, not a 2-hour game, and there's too much crammed in. A tighter focus and some streamlining would have produced a better result.

I was so nervous about this game...on paper it seemed like a perfect game, a seamless blend of tactics and strategy, a perfect balance of 4 asymmetrical races put in an interesting setting, high in flavor, lots of options, limitless replayability, short play time..........AND IT IS !!!! I cant tell you how glad i am that i bought in the hype, because "dudes on a map" is my favorite kind of game, and this one has no substitute! Its an instant favorite for me, and i can see i will be playing it a veeeeeeery long time. For those that cry "unbalanced" i say - give it time. I have played many combinations of races in a 2, or 3, or 4 player count, and the when you all understand what your goals are - its anybody's game. The game is just teeming with options, and there is always a way to win, no matter the race, no matter the situation....you just have to put yourself in a different mindset with every race you play, and THAT is what makes this game great! Some have more, some less, obvious strategies and paths to victory, but learning them is half the fun. My group and I have found that the more you are familiar with the game the more the options and strategies start to show themselves, new paths and new combos come in play with each play. Don't mistake complexity with unbalanced gameplay. This is the one that will be keeping our interest high for a long time to come, and after a short amount of time has become my go to game in this genere.

Having only played 4 times and the game seeming to lack a bit of balance i'm guessing the score could go up or maybe even down once I've played it more and added the expansion which i'm due to buy soon. First impressions are really good. It makes for a tense and interesting area control game which reminds me of the Command & Conquer video games. First-time players need to be aware of faction strengths before playing to avoid the humans running away with the game - this isn't a weakness in the design, though. For me and my collection, it fills a gap (a short-ish, light-ish, 4x-ish area control game) which i don't think will be plugged by anything else for some time yet. One of the few games which I want to reset and start again right after playing.

Asymmetry is a double-edged sword in gaming.  You need to balance it well in order to maintain competitiveness.  Mucking that up makes your game nigh unplayable, but hitting the spot makes your game an instant classic.

Did Cry Havoc muck it up?  Hard to say - I've only played it one time, but I didn't get a feeling that anything was really unbalanced.  Of course, nobody was expert enough with the game to truly say or do otherwise.  It definitely nails asymmetry well - the strengths and weaknesses of each race are apparent and you get a good touch of Ignacy's expertise all across the game (he's only been crapping out Neuroshima Hex factions for years, so I'm sure the designers appreciated his input).

The end result is a terrific Dudes on a Map game that seems over all-too-soon, but this just really means that the game doesn't overstay its welcome and you're rarin' to go again.  Taking the mechanic of scoring cards (e.g. scoring doesn't happen till someone plays that card, kinda like Twilight Struggle) coupled with area majority, players duke it out over areas of some sort of mountain (I think) to wrest control from the indigenous population and each other.

My only gripe about the game is the costly mobility.  I'm more used to Kemet-style movement where you can pick up groups and move them around.  In Cry Havoc, you have to purchase movement for each individual movement into each individual area, so don't expect to expand in all directions.  Unfortunately, this promotes a turtling strategy, even if indirectly, and I like a bit more aggression in these kinds of games.

Still, with unique powers and fancy rule-bending stuff up everyone's sleeves, the game remains interesting if lacking in a little tension.  The jury is still out to see if the Troggs (the natives) are in a crappy position all the time, but it doesn't seem like they lack a lot of opportunity - in fact, I think they should be playing scoring cards the most since they get paid the least.

Does it bring a lot to the table?  Nah.  It's nothing anyone needs to go rush out and buy, but if someone has it and puts it on the table, I'm up for it.  It's fun, not too long, and doesn't lend itself to a lot of analysis paralysis, which is ALWAYS a plus in my book.

Would play again.

Intense game. Too little room, too little time, too little resources to do everything you want - but these limitations apply to all players so it's about tilting the scales for yourself. I've played with 2 and 4 players. Very different feel with different player counts. I'm not a fan of the euro-race myself and do feel that there is something missing to get a higher rating. But that said, I do enjoy this game and feel that it deserves the 8. Looking forward for expansions.

EDIT: Rating down to 7. The scarcity started to become too frustrating. I will still play this and enjoy, but after some experience with this the feelings that the mechanics produce have become more clear. Those feelings of frustration (not wanting to use the cards during the turn because needed in battle AND not wanting to use the cards in battle to be able to use them in turn) took the enjoyment down a couple of notches.

The fighting, which I see as an important part of this game, did not make much sense to me, especially as the player, playing the grog. For a couple of reasons:
- Grog taking a prisoner?
- When someone takes the prisoner back, you don't gain from that, but they do loose points?
- You could gain control over an area... while all your guys are dead or taken prisoner?
- The kill phase should be the first phase in combat I think, instead of the last... as thematicly you can only take control over an area, if you got rid of the enemies
- The cards, which are hard to come by, play a very important role in combat... if you put it together like that the mechanic makes sense... but thematicly it doesn't to me.
- The hard to come by cards, can only be used in certain areas, while totally useless in other areas... feels very clunky.
- The deck creating mechanic is bad in this game. Some of the starting cards in your deck are just bad and there is no way to get rid of them. You have too little control over what cards you'll fill your deck with.

It is hard to explain a newbie how to win as every faction plays differently what of course is very interesting for a gamer. I won’t buy Cry Havoc but surely play it with the right group.

+ I really, really like the way combat works in this game.  It's different and refreshing. Plus I dig the card play.

Great combat resolution mechanics.  nice components but the factions seems to restrict way too much the way you play And the blue one is extremely boring to play (turtle your way in a game that beneficts exploration and battles..)

I will admit, I probably wouldn't have purchase Cry Havoc if I had not seen it on sale at a local game store, especially after loud noises eminating from BGG and other board game forums that proclaimed it to be unbalanced, overly restrictive and even broken.  So I entered the first game with some trepidation, but it was completely unecessary as after the first round, I was hooked.  I think there is a perception among board gamers that multiplayer asemetrical games are somewhat bad, like they couldn't possibly be balanced and that if I win or lose, it is the game and not by skill (or lack of) that determined the outcome.  Cry Havoc is a great game, on of the best area control/war game hybrids that I have played and is probably second only to Kemet.  I emplore you to ignore the naysayers and give it a try, as apart from some rough edges, it deserves your time and money.

N.B. - I do have a later version, which contains v1.1 on the rules.  This version omits the game shortening mechanic and relgates it to a variant, which is the correct decision in my mind as I don't think this mechanic is required or enjoyable.

[b]It looks like a fierce Ameritrash scifi game, but played like a euro influence game with a quirky but samey combat mechanic and fairly uninteresting cards. If this didn't have cool figs, and instead had wooden cubes, would this be any more popular than any other average euro influence game?

I don't know if it's so bad that anyone should hate it. It just...um...well, it's sort of a very distant cousin to El Granda. I could play it a second time, but I just can't think of any reason to do it.

RATING: 7
A wealth of great attributes in this area-control game, like the innovative multi-objective combat system, is somehow diminished by some problems. The factions feel interesting and different, but much seems to be sacrificed to achieve the asymmetry: First, the expectation of balance at all player counts is betrayed despite the efforts to include two different maps and the buffering neutral faction. Second, the steep learning curve from the increased number of unique abilities, buildings, and tokens is compounded with an already-fiddly set of interacting mechanisms and a sub-optimal rule book. The great card art and component design help bring the theme to life but one is left wishing for a nicer map on the board (and maybe more detailed minis). Overall, while other games might offer a much tighter experience (e.g., Blood Rage), this remains a strong entry in the genre with a tense and strategic delivery. Just be advised that it may take a few games for the rules and the most interesting strategic possibilities to sink in—and be prepared to incorporate house rules when any imbalances become apparent.

I like Portal Games and I like Nexus Ops (which has clearly inspired this game). So I thought I would like Cry Havoc, but after two games I´m still unsure if I shall keep it. It´s slower than Nexus and the added options do not really add much flavour.
I will try it once more to give it a chance.

Nagyon vártam, nagyon érdekelt, de nagy csalódás volt. Jónak ígérkezett ez a területfoglalós, deckbuilding mechanizmus, de valahogy a megvalósítás már nem okés.
Olyan sehonnan, sehová nem jutós a játék. Túl kevés akciód van ahhoz, hogy eljuss A-B-e. Ha egyszer sikerülne, és kiirtanak onnan, akkor a játék végig már a bázisod szomszédjában fogsz csak mászkálni, mert újra kihozni az egységeket már nem lesz elég akció. A harc is jól hangzik, de elég nyomorult. A védőnek hatalmas előnye van, a plusz embert behozó kártyák nagyságrendekkel erősebbek, mint a pakolgatósak, és egyetlen ember teljesen borítja a csata kimenetelét. Tipikusan a látszólag tervhezető, valójában tervezhetetlen mechanika. Egy 100 oldalú kockával jobban lehetne számolni, mint ezzel így. A pontozás talán a legnyomorultabb. Ha az első körben megkapod a pontozókártyát, amikor logikusan semmi értelme kitenni, akkor még egyszer fogsz vele találkozni a játék során, amikor ha nem jó a helyzet akkor ennyi, nem pontoztál a játékban. Arról nem is beszélve, hogy elviszi egy akciódat, így a pontozós körödben három helyett csak két akciód van, szóval nehéz bármikor is értelmesen kihozni belőle bármit. Pláne, hogy a harcok előtt ki kell tenni, szóval hatalmas lutri.
Mindez a támadgatás miatt még nyakonöntve egy adag "naveledkibaszok" érzéssel. Hatalmas csalódás.

RATING: 7
I was expecting to like this one, and I did!  Yes, it's pretty much the same "dudes on a map" Ameritrash formula that was established so well in the 1990s and is making a resurgence these days with games like Blood Rage and Kemet, but Cry Havoc does things differently and does them well!  Always enjoy using cards for multiple actions (movement, recruitment, etc.) but also they have text for battles and special actions as well.  Very straightforward in this regard.  Battles are also interesting, with the battle board that resolves quickly and with little mess, but creates some good tension as the play of Battle cards can definitely affect things.  The asymmetry is also very interesting and on first play can seem imbalanced in certain regards but my faith is with the designers and play testers who I'm sure considered all things.  If I have any complaints it is regarding the board art (which is very nondescript with its depiction of a space nebula or something like that) and the rulebook which feels like is missing a good deal of clarifications, but is well-written otherwise.  Cry Havoc may get lost in the sea of other popular Ameritrash games (the market is feeling a bit oversaturated these days) but it is as quality a design as the others.  So thumbs up from me so far!

Update: After my fourth game of Cry Havoc and I've decided to let it go. It's a good game with lots of interesting stuff going on as far as modern 'dudes on a map' games go. I think my biggest problem with it has nothing directly to do with the game. I think Cry Havoc is best if all players know what they're doing and can do it well. Otherwise, scores get quite disparate between each other as some player will often do far worse than others and there are not that many opportunities for catching up. And unlike some games, Cry Havoc isn't that much of a fun game to lose to. Watching yourself fall steadily behind is usually because you are in a weakened position. And by the last two rounds, players are picking on you to pick up easy points. In that I think there is a problem. It's one that can be solved by all players knowing what they should be doing (which you get from experience) but this is not a game I play often enough to get to that point, and so it leaves a rather unsatisfied feeling for those who can't pull it together.

After one player (with three players), I'm looking forward to trying each faction.  It's fairly quick and brutal, and my lack of ability to plan ahead got me crushed in the fifth and final round.  It does feel quite asymmetrical, which I like.  It feels a lot deeper than Blood Rage.

Played as Trogs in a 4-player game.  Very, very different than the other factions.  A lot of fun being the target of everyone else.

Curious about the game. But from the reviews, sounds somewhat lopsided. Also, this type of game (area control space conquest), while for some time, held my interest, it's starting to feel so old, now. Just so many titles with their own variations of pretty much the same thing- Kemet, Blood Rage, Shogun.... Also, the board is pretty ugly, in my opinion- too 'air-brushy' & featureless.

a very cool looking game with asymmetric races. sometimes I feel it might be skewed a litte to the humans, but im bot sure. There is so much to do, I love it! So here is the draw back that was pointed out to me in the SU&SD revview. There is alot to think about for making one move, meaning its very easy to have paralysis by analysis for everymove, making this game go a little slow. There are so many things you can do as well as your opponents that you try to think of all the possiblities to your actions causing your brain to explode! 

That being said, I still recommend this game, just be aware it is not a light game, and it will boil your brain.

I still very much enjoy this game and look forward to playing it some more, but there was quite a bit more downtime in my second play then there was in the first and the game got even shorter when I blew past the event marker in round 2 and shortened the game by one round.

This game doesn't bring much to a long list of similar games: Chaos in the Old World, Blood Rage, Hyperboria, and others. 
It is a clean design, for certain, but I am also not screaming to play again.

What I didn't like was that the game is short in terms of how many actions you can do, this makes some actions truly expensive at the expense of other actions where you can do more stuff. All in all I felt the game could have been better with another turn.

What I liked was the battle resolution mechanics which renders some battles - namely, the last battles since you need toys and cards to pull them off - unexpectedly fluid and narrative. I would like more of those please.

Overall, a good game but not an excellent one. Take it or leave it.

Not so fond of ecosystem-style asymmetry. I won my one game of this by just being the one player whose power wasn't kept in check by the other players'. And the deckbuilding is pretty bland.

Good mechanics, played it with 3, but I really think 4 is the best number to even out the end game a little. Because of the few actions (totally 15) there is little time to perform a lot of different attacks, so the end will decide a lot who is going to win.

As usual keeping out of trouble and attacking an already attacked player is beneficial.

When I first heard of Cry Havoc I didn't think it was a game I would like. It sounded like way more direct player conflict than I like in my games, but I thought the same thing about Blood Rage, and Cyclades, and Inis until I played them so I gave Cry Havoc a shot. 

So glad I did. The unique combat system and asymmetric player powers provide plenty to explore in this game and so far every game has played out differently, all in very fun ways. 

It's not my favorite dudes-on-a-map game, but it's up there.

Z początku zaskakująco pozytywny odbiór gry: 
+prosta, acz konkretna, nawalanka
+nowatorski i ciekawy systemem toczenia bitew
+mocno asymetryczne frakcje wymagające ogrania

Po kilku partiach wyszło na jaw wiele bolączek i niedoróbek:
- schematyczna pierwsza tura
- losowe żetony eksploracji - wyraźny podział na lepsze i gorsze, co na początku rozgrywki, choć nie kluczowe, może irytować
- wątpliwy balans frakcji (ludzie miażdżą, maszyny w ogonie)
- niemal zbędna jedna z akcji - rekrutacja. Prawie nie używana. Czyli zostaje tak naprawdę ruch i budowanie. Ewentualnie dobór karty. Dość ubogi wachlarz możliwości.
- tragiczna instrukcja

Z racji tego, pierwotną ocenę 8 zmuszony jestem zrewidować do 6. Choć to bardzo dobra gra i żałuję obecności tylu problemów.

I've been so inspired about new games lately, but I sat down to try this one. I had an amazing experience. I've already played it a second time.

The first time I played humans. It was the first time play, so I was a bit confused on what to do and how there buildings really work. But, I caught on and rode the humans to victory. All while the Grog player complained about how it was impossible for him to win.

So, second game I plated Grog and now people want to know how it is possible for Grog to lose.

I think I want to try Pilgrims next.

Your mobility is so limited, and your actions so tight, that you mostly feel stymied. Even when you can perceive an incoming threat, rarely is it the case that you feel like you have any real ability to confront it. The much-vaunted battle system, also, is too constrained--you see the same deployment patterns over and over, as the alternatives are all too often pointless. All in all, I find this game to be a very frustrating experience.

Essen 2016. Only played twice, so the quality of the game is like new!

The learning curve seems too high, so that the different factions are not balenced out well, unless you know how to play well with your faction against the other existing factions. Seem to bee great game though, if you have the time and players to learn it well enough. But i don't have them, i think. Thats why i wanna sell the game away.
I sell the game with the Promos from Essen 2016 (Cry Havoc New Orders - Mini Expansion 8 Cards with Quest for additional Goals and Points for the Final Scoring. Can't remember if these was all or other Promos might be included in the game material also).
Included in the Box comes a printed out FAQ and the four Strategie Guides for the four different factions from the game's original designer Grant Rodiek. This should be the things you should know, to play well with your faction and get better at winning with it.
Hope to get the game away to someone who might have the time and frinds to invest in this great game, that it really shines =)

*Rating After First Play - 5.5 - First of all, take anything I say in this review with a grain of salt since I've only played this game once. But I have not had an interest to replay this any time soon, which is saying a lot of a game, especially one I wanted to get my hands on the minute it was announced. 

My first play-through left me mostly unimpressed. After playing games like Cyclades, Kemet, and Blood Rage, I felt Cry havoc was severely lacking. It wasn't the worst game I played, but at the same time it didn't do anything for me. Below are my major gripes with game

First and foremost this game is not good with 3 players.  Having the Troggs be controlled in combat by the player next to you just doesn't work for me. It felt really cumbersome and annoying to give up your cards if you wanted to boost the trogs, who don't score anyway, then when it's your turn have nothing to play after wasting everything on preventing someone from claiming a region.  Not only does it gimp you, but it under-maximizes your actions on your turn, which is my next complaint.

Each player will have at most, 15 actions for the entire game. That's it. Once it feels like the game is sort of ramping up it ends. You are at the grace of your card draw to determine how you want to mobilize troops, build structures, and recruit. All this planning only for the game to abruptly end. Kemet does a great job of allowing you to do a lot as long as you're keeping others away from scoring a certain point threshold. 

Balance. Yes each race is uniquely designed and has their own "strengths" but The Human and Trogg races are the strongest hands down due to their ease of moving around the map. The Machine is decent at defense, but that is all, and the Pilgrims are simply the weakest and most boring to play. Also if you play with some one that is just a little bit experienced at the game you will lose, unless you play the Human faction. At 2 and 3 players this imbalance really bears its ugly head. The game really suffers here and is one of the major reasons I'm not in a rush to get it played again.

Aside from the major three listed above, there are a ton of minor quibbles I have with the game.

-There is simply not enough Event & exploration tokens in the game. Games will feel samey with 4 of the 6 possible events happening every game. Seriously, come on! Add like 30 of those things
- Not enough variety in cards. A lot of duplicates in each pile makes for people just aiming for those power cards for their "decks" Again, game feels stripped in this department
-Combat is actually pretty unique, but I feel most players will just go the VP route. Allowing some to get ahead will cut down the play time of the game, but then you run into a runaway leader problem, and in this game it feels almost impossible to come back.
-The rule book is simply put, a mess. Important things and mechanics are off in sidebars or out of order.
-I can see this getting old fast. Once you know the go to strategy for your faction, it won't matter what others do, hence why experienced players will trounce newbies. 

Overall I don't see myself keeping this in the long run. It sits on my shelf basically untouched. I doubt an expansion will liven it up for me either and won't be shocked to see a Second/Revised edition come out (this is Portal Games we're talking about) in the near future to fix these blemishes.

UPDATE:  I lowered my rating down to a 4. I finally decided to sell this one off. The biggest disappointment of 2016 by far. There's a reason it is constantly on sale at MM, CSI and Amazon, tons of copies that these stores want to unload.When the game was swimming around the $57.99 range, and now usually gets cut down to $30 in almost every sale since late 2016, means something. The game is below-average at best, needs a nice rules overhaul and a few expansions to be decent. Stick to Kemet, Blood Rage , Cyclades or hell even El Grande for your area control fix. Or, if you can find a copy, Nexus Ops...which I wish I kept thinking this pile of trash would replace it.

This is one of the worst dudes on a map game. No customization of your race, you have to follow strict strategic path every game and map wouldnt be changed. Low replayability. In combat your card which is chosen from randomly 2 terrain cards may change every clever step you has established. Once you get the combat mechanism, it becomes predictable and dull.

Nothing interested. Unbalanced factions, dull and repetitive strategies, predictable choices, terrible deck building mechanism (it doesnt offer any interesting choices about hand management) cool theme but rest of it is just terrible.

I don't think any game is worth a 10, nor do I think any game is worth a 1.  So this vote of 10, is to counter the rather stupid low scores that people have given the game for reasons that make no sense, such as - The look of the game, the fact that someone that knows the game will beat someone that doesn't ( this could work with any game ever made, someone with more experience has a better chance of winning ).

This is one of the weakest in terms of design and balance among the bunch of recently released "dudes-on-the-map" games. Every faction had a very specific role in the game and if someone is clueless or messed up, a certain faction will just overrun the game. Didn't enjoy it.

Need more plays, but first went well.

I really enjoy the tense decision making going on, since you are limited to three actions each round.   It makes for tough choices.  I love the asymmetric play of each faction, and they feel really different from each other.  

Lots of bluffing and guessing what you're opponent will do.  I like how the initiative turn order is up to the players.

Artwork is phenomenal, and the components are outstanding!


I'm looking forward to the next expansion: Aftermath, but I really really hope they come out with more factions for the 2nd expansion - like the dude on the cover would make a cool faction.  Cards for combat and actions is great which leads to the tough decisions.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (January 2017)

Cry Havoc is a well-regarded game but I’m not a “dudes on a map” kind of gamer so I wasn’t expecting much from it, and I was right. It is an ok game but not a game for me.

The rules are easy to grasp. You can teach the game under 18 minutes. Playtime is around 3 hours the first time but with experience you can play it faster.

It has gorgeous components and great production values. The art is also pretty cool.

I like the theme.

The factions of the game all play very different and everyone has some skills that won’t play every time, so the game has lots of replayability and that’s always welcomed. There is a bit of deckbuilding with the cards, but there is also some luck with them. Managing your deck is important. The combat system is unique and interesting, even if you lose you can do something interesting, still it gets repetitive soon. 

The player who played with the human faction, said it was very weak compared to the other ones, but as I have only played the game once I´m still not sure this is the case. All players have to gang upon the Torg player or he could win the game easily and I think I kind of dislike this, although it makes thematic sense as they are the natives. Perhaps the game´s factions are unbalanced.

I didn’t read the rules but the friend who did said it wasn’t very good.

Bottom line, I don’t like the game very much, however I don’t like the genre much. Cry Havok can be a good “dudes on a map game”, it seems it has a high replayability with the variable faction´s skills, but after all that, it isn’t a game for me. I’m not sure if the game is balanced but it seems like it is not. It is kind of boring and repetitive for me. I already sold my copy of the game. I will probably play it again if suggested but if I don’t play it ever again I won’t be sad.

I can understand the appeal of Cry Havoc, a low-randomness asymmetric dudes-on-a-map game that plays quickly and rewards control of regions.  The greatest innovation is the unique three-tiered battle system requiring allocation of forces to control, prisoners, and attrition, providing multiple objectives for players within a single battle and greatly reducing the typical zero-sum nature of encounters in such games.

I prefer Nexus Ops as a quicker and more attack-oriented game in this vein (even with the dice combat), but Cry Havoc is a quality title which offers some innovation in this genre and should play in 60-90 minutes once the players are familiar with the rules.

Cry Havoc brings together an impressive combination of several mechanics that results in a fresh, enjoyable entry in the light skirmish genre. This game has a lot to offer: asymmetrical factions, area control, deckbuilding, hand management, plenty of conflict, an innovative diceless combat system, quality miniatures, and striking artwork. Put all this together with its relatively short play time, and Cry Havoc seems to be an impressive design. I'm not sure about balance and repeat playability, but my initial impression is favorable.

Lots of fun, very smart, just long enough, super-tense. Card combat abilities are obtained in a very random way, hampering long-term strategic planning is the only major downside. Sides being overly asymmetric is another downside, but a minor one - I really only want to play the machines, for instance, which could be a problem in certain groups. Other than those, cool game, give it a try if you can.

wow massive disappointment.  It feels like it was made in the late 80s.  In itself it isn't terrible, and I don't think it is broken.  The problem is it is boring.  Five or less turns with three actions per turn means 15 actions.  That is it.  Boring, just boring.  Just as it gets interesting the game is over.  Replay-ability seems almost zero as each faction has a very specific path to victory and if a player doesn't follow the path carefully they probably won't win when playing against competent players.  Yawn is my overall reaction and this is the first game from Portal to generate a negative  reaction from me.  Oh well you can't like them all I guess.

Here is a walkthrough I prepared for this game:
https://boardgamegeek.com/video/114452/cry-havoc/how-play-quick-video-w-doron

Revised my opinion to the better after playing a 4 player game:
I'm glad to support the notion this game does NOT suffer from balance issue. You just need to know the game well, and the faction's abilities you control.
Excellent game. Played it at all player counts and 4 player seems to be the way to go.
Each faction has its unique ability that you need to embrace, while balancing with territory control and protection of the regions you control.
---->>>> On a different note, the limitation of no more than 15 actions is a bummer as by the time to feel you established yourself, the game is almost over. That being said, making the best of the situation in limited number of actions makes this a strategic game.

Definitely a keeper and instant placement in my top 10 games of all time. I think the issue of balance might 'disappear' once all players know how to use their structures well.

2016-12-28 - 8 - For me it's much better confrontational game than Kemet. For now it's my favourite "put figures on the map, fight and do some other things" game. It's not as limiting in how much you are able to do as I thought from some of the reviews.

2017-05-19 - 8->6 - I played few more times and I still prefer this one over Kemet, but I have some issues with it. At first every faction is interesting with their abilities, but after a while it seems that every army has 2-3 tricks up in their sleeve and you need to perform them again and again during the whole game. 
The game is punishing - if you make a mistake you might be technically out of the game even if there are 2-3 rounds till the end.
I guess its the depth that I'm missing - there is not much room for spectacular recovery like you could do in - lets say - El Grande or more typical area control game.

RATING: 6.5
After playing Cry Havoc I realize something: I do not enjoy highly asymmetrical games. Because, the game forces you to play in a optimal way for your faction. Which, instead of increasing replayability, actually reduces, because every game you use the same faction you will play the same way. Anyways, did not enjoyed the plays I had... Also, I do not want to play with humans anymore (played two times).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I really enjoy this. The limit on the number of actions you can take in the whole game being so small makes every decision seem vital or critical in its timing. I have yet to try the 4 player, but the 3 player game really is very enjoyable. I have played all factions and i don't agree with the belief that the humans are over powered. They are strong, and perhaps the fact they are the easiest to play means people have found them winning more than the others. A great purchase and I am looking forward to the expansion very much.

Not as good as blood rage, better than kemet and cyclades. Many think this game is unbalanced. This is only the case for players who have only played the game a handful of times or have given no effort to learning how to play the other races. This game is extremely asymmetric, very similar to Chaos in the Old World. Humans are very easy to play and win in the beginning, but pale in comparison to other races when the game is played with hardcore gamers.

Alapvetően eléggé tetszik a játék, de sajnos tipikus Portal Games kiadás olyan szempontból, hogy legalább 3-4 helyről kell összevadászni a szabályokat. Pedig a szabálykönyv elsőre jónak tűnt. Viszont rögtön az első fordulóban olyan kérdések merültek fel, amikre nem leltem választ a szabálykönyvben. A Watch It Played videó is nagyon jó, de sajnos muszáj a fórumokon, FAQ-ban további pontosítások után nézni.

Az aszimmetrikusság része szerintem nagyon jó, tényleg nagyon másképpen kell játszani a különböző csapatokkal. A kiegyensúlyozottságról nehéz nyilatkozni, annyira mások a lehetőségek, hogy legfeljebb érzetről lehet beszélni ezzel kapcsolatban, nehéz összehasonlítani a képességeket hasznosság alapján. A játékmenet viszonylag egyszerű, gyors, a 30perc/fő reális elejében, ezen biztosan lehet faragni, szerintem egy négyfős parti lemehet másfél óra alatt setup nélkül. Ez azért elég nagy előnye a játéknak, hogy egy egészen komolynak ható területfoglalós játék érzetét kelti, miközben kezelhető marad a játékidő.

Sajnos a feleségem ennyire még egy játékkal kapcsolatban sem volt elutasító, így nem marad a háztartásunkban... Mármint a Cry Havoc. :)
Az igazsághoz az is hozzátartozik, hogy valószínűleg túlzott elvárásaim voltak a játékkal kapcsolatban, ahhoz képest kicsit csalódás volt. Ettől függetlenül a harci rendszere tényleg nagyszerű, egy vesztes csatából is lehet profitálni, ha ügyesek vagyunk. Mindenféleképpen szívesen játszom még vele.

This game's mechanics are strong, and it is fun. The game, however, lacks decision making. The combat mechanic is great and innovative, but pretty quickly you realize that there are only so many outcomes that are strictly good, and the combat tricks don't really feel dynamic, more like "well you did literally the best choice, but now I am going to win anyway". Perhaps I have gotten jaded, but the game could have done one of many things better:
It doesn't end satisfyingly.
The four factions are good at different stages, but this makes it feel like you can't catch up when the blue or yellow factions are let to snowball.
The cards seem to present choices, but each is really only good at one or two things - except for the blue faction, who are actually pretty flexible.
I've seen the blue or yellow faction win every game. Faction balance is off, especially because some factions heavily rely on skills you might not even get!

After a first game with the humans against the Pilgrims:

The Pilgrims had a hard time: they were not generating enough victory points. In hindsight, this is because their obvious strategy was not followed (extract and harvest crystals in well-defended territories). The problem is that my opponent suffered a lot from this, during the whole game. Thus, this is a game where following the natural strengths of your race is crucial (this is not something which happens in even a game like Puzzle Strike so strikingly); not doing it can result in a less-than-fun game.

The humans were really easier: their runway helped send control tokens in Trog-infested zones that the Pilgrims did not dare to tread.

As a corollary: this means that the broad strategy of each race is scripted: what lies behind it? I do not know yet, but I am keen to explore. I prefer variable player powers that are more flexible (like those in Puzzle Strike).

The rule questions were all easily answered. Now, I would have preferred it if there were fewer non-obvious rule questions: there are many little corner cases that require looking at the FAQ, etc. (like whether you can move during combat tokens that "act as units" [from the Human Structures]).

The theme was not as obvious in my eyes as in a game like Keyflower (!), where many things make sense in some obvious and flavorful way: in Cry Havoc, we played many cards just for their icons, without looking much at their title, etc. The lack of strong flavor of the generic icons (which we used a lot) did not make up for the flavor of the illustration and card name (which we did not have to look at). In Keyflower, the powers make you want to look at the tile titles, which you have to look at anyway if you want to refer to the tiles during the main phase of the game.

The innovative battle system did not click so much with me: the attacker would try to control the territory (because the defender could not move in to add troops anyway after the attack), and the defender would kill units (since the cause was lost).

In conclusion (after a single game):
- some things are good (nice game material, globally solid main rules, each kind of terrain cards have the same kind of icons, which helps build a meaningful deck,…)
- some are not so good but can maybe be overcome (using some races is definitely harder—this can lose you the game right at the beginning, which is not fun—, as a consequence the races have a broad strategy which is scripted, some more subtle rule interactions require a FAQ—I am afraid not everything is there—, many powers are used for generic icons—but maybe the players can decide as a rule to read the card titles—,…)
- I still have hopes that the game is interesting and rich, but I will have to play again.

I was looking super much forward to this game but there were only three races with 3 players and there is a lot of steps just to complete 1 of the up to 5 gaming rounds. The strategy, theme, battles, quality is top notch but drawing cards from different piles is kind of not optimal when it can only be played in some regions. the game pace is slow and it takes a lot of plays to get into it as in much games. Hopefully my kids want to play it when they understand it =) so it is a keeper and can be played with just 2 players also but it might be even better with 3-4 players. For now it feels lika an 8 as a 2 playergame but I really want to play it with 4 players.

Initial Impressions: The different factions have fairly different play styles. I like the abilities you can have can be changed from game to game, although I'm not sure if they change up play style enough to add a huge amount of replayability. I also wonder how much of this game is group , in that a specific faction has to be careful to keep another in check to prevent them from running away with it similar to Chaos in the Old World (if I had to guess it isn't nearly as dependent).

I really like how the combination of hand management and 3 actions per turns makes for some really tough decisions both in choosing what cards to allocate for what action, and also needing to be very careful with timing. The deck building aspect also while not that strong is implemented pretty seamlessly.

The combat resolution is pretty cool and although I wish it was a little bit faster I think overall it is a positive. Battle cards for the most part have fairly basic effects, although more complicated ones would bog the game down.

The idea is great. I like the assymetrical factions although the balance is terrible (not a good thing in a game with just 4 factions). I like the look of the game and the deckbuilding element. But I don't like the combat system. The resolution of combat is known in 90% before combat begin, there is almost no risk. I know that these days there is a style to do a diceless combat games which look more like euro games but there is not any thrill in this style.

I think it's trying to mix too many different play mechanics, and doesn't quite do any of them in a satisfying amount/way. For instance, the deck building is weak, you may add a few cards to your deck, but not enough to make a huge  impact. It's not exactly a war game, and it's barely an area control game. I really disliked the way battles are handled with the multi-faceted battle objective board, it's just an overly complicated way of handling a situation where 'OK, I have 5 guys, you have 3. I keep mine here and you retreat'. I just didn't think the game did any one thing particularly well, and while I may try it again, I wouldn't request it, and certainly would  never buy it.

Played the game at Gencon.  Game was extremely unbalanced.  If one or more players are not at the same level as the rest, the game balance falls apart.  An experienced player could never play with less experienced players and have a balanced game.

RATING: 6
Very good for a war game, but you can definitely be picked on. Not eliminated, but with very few actions in the game, you might be forced into just defence and not doing the fun stuff that the faction specializes in. Also, ran kind of long for my taste. 3hrs for 4 players

This game was probably my favorite game of 2016.  I love the combat resolution mechanic.  The length is just about right.  The only thing I'm dinging this for is that the human faction seems out of balance.

This game is so pretty.  Production quality is magnificent.  After four plays however, it feels like a glorified game of Nexus Ops (which I prefer).  Now each play has been with a new set of gamers, so maybe if I played with people who regularly played it it might be better.  It's on my trade list but it's one I'm hesitant to trade.  I feel that three players is the only way to play.

RATING: 6
A high quality game by one of my favorite publishers. The mechanics are solid and the game plays smoothly. The combat mechanic is unique and battles are fought quickly, with the tide turning on each card played.

The main issue is in the balance of the factions. This game is asymmetry at it's purest, and experienced gamers will be able to win with any faction. This experience however, requires a significant investment in time learning the nuances of each faction. Most games will be runaway victories until groups have had time to learn and study the game.

RATING: 5
Not a massive fan of this - the asymmetrical start-up feels like it gives each player a unique role, but annoyingly, if you've made a wrong move or go against expected strategy at the start, it can be very difficult to recover. This leads to two solid hours of watching everyone else race ahead with little hope of catching them up.

My other quibble is that there are nowhere near enough Tactical Terrain Cards for the 4-player game, resulting in all the decks getting emptied very quickly.

RATING: 7.5
Good asymmetric area control/dudes on a map game with lots of battles and a bit of card draughting. 

Definitely seems to be a game that benefits from familiarity of the races and honing their specific strategy to win. 

May increase my score with multiple plays to test that train of thought.

Las facciones son asimétricas y eso plantea un reto distinto para sacar el mayor provecho de cada una de ellas. Lo malo es que no están completamente balanceadas y lo demuestra el hecho de que sacaron un FAQ para arreglar a los humanos. Las acciones son insuficientes para hacerlo divertido y las peleas son innovadoras, pero no divertidas.

I like the card system and quick action of the game. Combat system is innovative but it's very straightforward, only get's interesting when players have plenty of units and they have some terrain cards (the basic cards don't matter enough). Locking of battle regions is irritatingly restricting sometimes, Pilgrims also play out a bit boring. 
Afraid it doesn't stay interesting for many plays but so far really enjoying it. One big complaint: the rules are a total mess.

Traded for Keyflower w/expansions and upgraded resources 12/11/16.

Mary's dislike of the conflict in the game meant that it wasn't really going to be played very often.

---

Bought 10/9/16 on Amazon.

I love the asymmetry and the deckbuilding.  The trogs make this a much better 2p game than Blood Rage.  Each faction really plays different, from the defensive Euro engine building of the Pilgrims to the offensive decimation of the machines.

The combat is a little too aggressive for Mary though.  She feels "like a tyrant" when playing the Machines, and doesn't often use the more aggressive features of the factions to their full advantage.

Rated provisionally based on one play at Gen Con. Waiting for the game to come out and get more plays in before giving a final opinion, but my first impression was that it's extremely fun.

Update: dropped to a 7 for repeated balance issues in the three player game. Scouting can be removed to balance the humans, but that doesn't prevent the pilgrims from sucking, and being boring to play (which is worse).

A nice tight area control game with asynchronous factions, and player powers.  Enjoy the battle board mechanic and the option to switch things around.  Lots of bits and takes a while to set up because of this.  Good production values.  Will have to keep an eye out for other Portal games.  Happy to play it, but don't need to own it.  May rate higher with further plays.

A bad rulebook requiring a long FAQ and balance issues mar what should be an interesting game.

Update: After five plays, I'm done with this mess. Eventually, the designers may balance this thing properly, but I didn't sign on to be a Portal Games beta tester. 

I hope the person to whom I sold Cry Havoc likes it better than I did.

An excellent area control strategy game that has an elegant and concise rules system that may look complicated at first but moves at a nice clip once you’re used to it. All 4 factions play very differently but are fun to use, at first glance the Trogs (only playable with 4) may seem overpowered but they are actually pretty evenly balanced, especially when you know how to make the most of a factions strengths.

This is a great mix of mechanisms (deck building, area control, variable faction powers, deterministic combat...) and all wrapped up in a great theme with amazing art and miniatures. I'm gushing after just one play through and I think I'm going to enjoy this game for a long time to come.

Update: Still loving it. Wish the rules were clearer, but, now that I know it, it flows pretty smoothly.

Update 2: Starting to realize that this game almost never hits the table, and that I'm not really super-excited to play it. I guess I'm more of a "care bear" than I thought. And my family and friends don't get it / like it much.

Another Politrash game. So how is it different from Nexus Ops? Well, one of the players, The Trog, is very unique in that they start in the middle and control all of the encounter tokens. Also, players only have one type of unit but can build buildings into tiles. Oh, and there are different types of commands so more choices to make and most importantly a very fresh new combat system where you put troops between (dominance, capture and kill). You can actually destroy all the other troops but not take over the territory. It's wonky but I think it works fine.

Not exactly my kind of game, but has some interesting mechanisms and twists on area control. I like how combat is broken into 3 parts, so you can "lose" the battle, but still might benefit by taking a prisoner for example. The "deckbuilding" is pretty nice, and planning out what you'll play in your future turns is rewarded. The factions are very different and the game seems to have a good amount of replayability.

Not bad, but a little too samey from one game to the next. Also too short to see much combat and interaction. The replay value definitely comes from using the different factions, and you're still just expanding out and deciding how many troops you want to bring with you to each region. I think the game is fine, but I would rather play Nexus Ops if given the choice.

In deep space, players have found a planet inhabited by Trogs. In this 2-4 player game, players take on the role of Trogs, Humans, Pilgrims or Machines. Each race have their own deck of cards for moving, recuriting and building structures.  The structures that each race build are different as well.  On a turn, players can also draw more cards from a common deck, to add a card building aspect to the game. Battle resoultion is done without dice, on a board where you place your units. You have to decide whether you want your units to control the area, take prisoners, or attrition, and all three methods score differently. Players can play tactics card oout of their hand to influence where to place units before resolving battle, provided the tactics card matches the terrain. 

This is a fun game. I especially like the battle resolution. Frequently, many games rely on luck of the dice. I also like how each race has different powers and different skills, but for some reason, whoever plays the machines generally doesn't do well. I think the machines are weaker, but we might be missing something in their structures.  It will be fun exploring different races. In 2-3 player games, the Trogs aren't managed by a player, and that leads to a different playing experience.
You can do poorly in ths game if you get targeted unfairly, which frequently happens, but we aren't quite experienced enough. So it could be a very good game, but based on the weakness of the machines, and the multiplayer trageting which could be unfair, it's okay.

Okayish miniature area control war game. Some unique mechanics and nice component quality.

Pros:
- Very nice and unique combat mechanic that works well and is surprisingly deep
- Intense and pretty fast paced, players are in battle within first game round
- Good component quality
- Streamlined rules that are easy to understand
- Asymmetric powers, I like it

Cons:
- Nothing else than war and conquering here, just not my kind of game I guess
- May get heated, don't play with angry people
- Something missing, just too straightforward for me

Come molti giochi del momento ecco l'arrivo d miniature che danno un valore aggiunto a questo ennesimo gioco asimmetrico. Gioco da 4 (in meno perde molto) per la supremazia del territorio. Carino il tentativo di ambientare le fazioni  con poteri completamente differenti ma che necessitano di esperienza per essere tutti appresi. Trovo il gioco di alcune fazioni molto ripetitivo (vedi i mistici blu) e altre invece sempre al centro del gioco (i verdi). Effettivamente mi sembrano ben bilanciate ma al momento, seppur il gioco necessita di altri approfondimenti gli preferisco altri giochi di miniature come The Lord of Ice Garden, Blood Rage e Scythe.

A very tactical 2-4 player "dudes-on-a-map" skirmish game that is minimal on luck.

So far, I have found the game to be rather mediocre. Especially poor is when one player starts to get a sizable advantage, they tend to steamroll the other players for the rest of the game and the points end up being very lopsided.

It provides some interesting parts - I like how each race is encouraged along different paths but not forced to follow; I thought the battle mechanism was interesting; there are engaging decisions on whether to spend cards for actions or keep them back for battles. But it doesn't overcome the inherent flaw, it being an open-hitter. It's easy for one person to be picked on and taken out of the game (there being too few turns to climb out of the hole) but it's also easy to reach a turtle-y stalemate, where you're discouraged from hitting the leader because you're leaving yourself open to be hit by anyone else. But you have to hit the leader, so you have to expose yourself. Too open. It's trying to hit that middle-ground between the cleverness of Nexus Ops and the epic battle-games. But it fails to deliver either of the aspects that makes these games replayable - the Nexus Ops missions that drive non-turtling and who to hit, and the longer games that provide comeback and epic-ness capabilities.

Solid "dudes on a map" game, but not ultimately as good as others. I'd definitely be up for a game most of the time, but would definitely rate, Mare Nostrum, Eclipse, Forbidden Stars, Mission Red Planet, Chaos in the Old World, Cthulhu Wars and other titles first. Of course these are different games, but how many dudes on a map games can one play/ own?

A quick to battle game that has been compared to one of my favorites in the genre, Nexus Ops. I can see the similarities in theme and essence but otherwise the game plays quite differently while keeping that quick to conflict and fast action game play I like so much. You are in your face right away and with Cry Havoc the strategy really changes based on your race. Although it may seem unbalanced at times, it is just the quick nature of the game. Overall though, a lot of fun to play.

At least it's not just me.  After playing this a few more times, I decided certain things about it were not right for me.  I reluctantly brought up my opinion, and was relieved to find two others in my gaming group were harboring the same reservations.  Will probably be trading or donating this game to one of my FLGS that is starting to build a play library, as plenty of gamers out there love this game.  Sadly, I have learned it is just not for me.

I can't help but compare the game to Blood Rage. While completely different, they result in the same feelings I have. I am not excited by the game play or area control. I understand both games are well received but I am just not the target market. In the end, both games are really well designed and have interesting combat but not really my style. This one offers many different strategies depending on your faction and it has some cool cards and features to work around. I would play again if requested but I don't think I would ever request it. (same with blood rage).

RATING: 7
This is a perfectly fine dudes on the map game where players have small personal decks of cards they use to battle into areas that have point income tokens. Battles have a layer of interest, as players can assign their units into three different battle categories, that get resolved one at a time top to bottom. There's actually winning and getting points, then there's capture an opponent's guy, then there's kill the opponent's units. This also gets complicated by the further playing of action cards which can reverse the order of resolution, or move an extra guy into battle. I would say the game is competent in it's genre, but I would rather be playing [thing=127023][/thing] or [thing=15363][/thing] in it's slot.

The one big feather in this game's cap that maybe sets it apart from others in it's genre, is that I see this game working just fine with 3 players. When you play with 3, there are monsters that populate the board, not unlike the Ancients in [thing=72125][/thing]. The way that you then handle 4 players is that the 4th player takes on the role of those monsters, and has slightly different scoring processes as a result of them being everywhere at the start of the game.

Maybe the one thing that keeps this good game from being great is that it has the fairly typical trouble of each faction's asymmetry completely defining it's playstyle and also assigning them the job of keeping one other specific faction in check. The excitement of battles wears down quickly as well, as there are only two or three significant card effects that can influence the outcome, and your opportunity to play those cards is somewhat limited as you don't want to pass when you are willing, but once your pass you are out, regardless of what your opponent plays after you pass.

I love the combat mechanics with the battle board and optional card play. I don't really like how opaque the general strategies are and how it seems to be set up as a lifestyle game that you have to play lots of times with experienced players to get a good, balanced game. I need to play it another time or two before solidifying my opinion, though.

Sajnos csak egyet sikerült vele játszani, és ott is hibáztunk a játék végének kiváltását illetően. Egy területelfoglalós játékról van szó, ahol minden küzdő félnek egy kicsit más a célja, más megoldásokkal tudja a legtöbb pontot kihozni. A játék egy idegen bolygón játszódik, amit foggal-körömmel akar védelmezni az ocsmány zöld faj, az oda betolakodóktól. Minden egyes faj egyedi tulajdonságokkal és bónuszokkal bír, amit kell használni.
Fontos még megemlíteni a játékban megtalálható többféle mechanizmust, a pakliépítést, az akcióválasztást és az egyedi harcrendszert.

Pros:
1. Assymetric - Each faction available to the players have their own deck, buildings, and abilities. This makes the game extremely interest to replay.
2. Battle System - This is the best battle system I have ever played. Players "vote" on which part of the battle they want to win. The options being territory control, killing characters, or taking prisoners. Cards allow players to manipulate the results, but players need to make the decision of playing battle cards or keeping cards for actions on their turn. Great decision point in every aspect.
3. Different routes to victory - Players can choose to go full bore and spread across the map, or focus on gathering crystals, or just snag a whole lot of prisoners.
4. Not Unbalanced - Many many people like to complain that this game is unbalanced. Portal games had this in development for many years, then people play the game twice and claim it's unbalanced. It's a silly complaint and completely untrue. 

Cons:
1. Conflict to Balance - This game faces the same issue all conflict based games have. Players need to keep each other in check or one player will run away with the game. Players need to have some idea of who is has the chance to run away with the game and make sure they stop that player. If players refuse to play the board and only want to play within their area, this game will have a runaway winner.
2. Too Short - The game is too short for me. You are already faced with extremely limited turns with extremely limited amount of cards. Then after 5 rounds (maybe) and 3 turns in each the game ends. I need at least one more round.
3. Fringe Cases - There are many many times where you will need to refer back to the rule book to determine the order of operations. Order of actions and resolution of actions is extremely important. Many of the fringe cases are not addressed in the rulebook.

Overall: This is a very solid game. I enjoyed playing it a lot. I did end up trading it away as I could not get it to the table enough, but I would happily play this game if someone offered it up.

RATING: 3.7
As interesting as some of the mechanics are... I actively dislike the combat system, which is a shame as it's the single thing you'll be engaging with most all game long.   
The battle board mini-game makes fights a complete chore, and the endless use of "take that!" cards ensure that what goes into a fight has almost nothing to do with what comes out of it.
The asymmetrical player powers and play styles, however, are really cool!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.4
Fine.  Another junk-drawer design (ala kemet), where every subsystem feels borrowed and boring.  The Study in Emerald derived card play is especially dull and the half-assed sci-fi theme is frankly a little patronizing.  Still better than eating tacks.

Well, my favorite game is Blood Rage so I love a good area control game with some fighting mechanic besides dice. At first this game feels so tight that it is almost unbearable, but eventually you find yourself becoming more proficient. It's at that point, you really start to enjoy this game. I love the asymmetrical powers and the various skills. This game is solid. Basically, a different theme for a Kemet/Blood Rage kind of game. It's nice to have variety of theme and mechanics when you walk to the shelf for a tactical area control game. The trifecta is Blood Rage, Kemet, and Cry Havoc. My dice version is Nexus Ops. That should hold me over for a while.

I generally like the idea of area control games more than I actually like them.  I wanted to try this game because I'd heard so much about it.  Usually I'm disappointed by "hyped" games.  This one didn't disappoint.  I enjoyed it.

Is it as good as the hype I heard?  No, but I did like it more than I thought I would.

The variable races make for an interesting game dynamic.

I don't know, something is "missing".  It seems like you have the capability to do so much, then the game is over. We tried taking away the basic 5 turn rule and just said "first to 50".  But even that didn't seem to make the game "flow". The basis of the game is great and so is the theme, but I don't think the races are even and the pace seems off.

Hangs together decently enough, and everything is very refined, with no rough edges. The powers or nicely differentiated. Combat is very clever. Can't think of any particular flaws.

Really good game, but it has an extremely high learn curve.  The basic mechanics are simple to pick up but it will take 5-10 plays to see the depth of each faction.  Players will need to be on same skill level, if not the more experienced player should become the runaway leader.

Not enormously gripping, and the balance issues seem huge. I played for the first time as Humans against experienced players, made what I believe were a few sub-optimal decisions and still obliterated my opponents. Perhaps the game shines at different player counts?

Rulebook not as good as I would hope - there are some ambiguities or scenarios that didn't seem to be addressed.

RATING: 4
Lot of neat mechanics stuck together in a way that doesn't work.  Movement is too slow.  The board is too stack.  Small elements of luck are too hard to overcome.  There are too many incentives to turtle.  There are not enough turns to make use of asymmetric powers and buildings.  The game offers a bunch of neat ideas and then doesn't let you actually play around with them.

It might work better with 2.  With 4, it's a mess.  I don't think 3 will be much better.

Improved ranking from 7 to 8 to 9. Rules seemed flat and strange upon reading, first game was unimpressive, but this is a game that you absolutely have to play multiple times. The differences between the races are not there to provide you variety, they are core parts of the game. The variety comes from the emergent game situations when the systems and all small differences between games happen, but mostly it is about the choices of the players in how to deal with the situations. Very impressive game.

RATING: 8.5
29-10-2016. Rated after 3 plays. Cry Havoc is a dudes on the map game combined with a deck builder. In the game, you are an invading race of aliens trying to obtain special crystals. In the end, the player with most VPs wins.

With 2 or 3 players, you play one of three possible races that all have very different abilities, buildings and technologies to learn and exploit. With 4, the indigenous creatures rise up and instead of fighting every invading race they are controlled by a player.

The game takes just 4 or 5 rounds. Each round consists of 3 actions. You can move troops, recruit troops, draw 2 cards, keep 1 (also to buy new cards), buy/use technology. The game revolves around clever card play of your hand of cards. Most actions that you can take are 'powered' by spending cards from your hand. You can spend 1 or more cards to obtain movement points, recruit points and the like.  You can obtain new cards to improve your deck, but that's limited given the brevity of the game.

Combat occurs when two players simultaneously in one area. This locks the area down (no figures can move in, or out), and a fight happens at the end of the round. Combat is very cool and resolves around spending the dudes you have in an area. The dudes you have in the area can be attributed to one of three combat objectives. The first is majority, with the player who assigned most guys here winning majority forcing his enemy to move out. The second objective is capture, majority here allows you to capture an enemy model somewhere on the combat board. The last objective is killing, and each model assigned here kills an enemy model (if able). All combat objectives net you VPs.

I also like the exploration tokens, and the Trog resistance.

I really like Cry Havoc, the game is pretty (except the board!), and allows for interesting decisions on how to spend your cards, actions and mini's. The deckbuilding aspect is quite minimal, but buying new cards does make a difference. I did like the 3P game the best, but with 4 it's very interesting too. Great game. Love to play. Takes about 2H.

RATING: 6
High entry point game. I think now that I have Forbidden Stars I will sell this one as it is in all respects worse than Forbidden Stars.

Its Area Control game with deckbuilding mechanic. Each player has limited number of actions until the game ends (9-15). Its great for all those dudes that like to min-max everything.

Combat isnt awesome, its inventive but just tad uninteresting, without playing cards you can predict how it will play outbefore it even starts.

It isnt random - no dice rolling or anything, only thing random is drawing cards but you can predict what cards you will draw

Overall its solid game and a lot of tought was put into design... to much if you ask me as everything fits perfectly even to perfectly eg each faction has one correct playstyle.

For this kind of game it really is key to play with players of roughly same experience as someone who knows what he is doing will leave newbies behind.

RATING: 8
Exciting to plan out moves, battle board + cards makes for very tense battles, the tight map sets up interesting logistics puzzles.  And the light deck building is fun too. I don't play many of these conflict oriented games, this has the right amount of meat for me without dragging too long or getting too complicated. The rulebook does leave a few annoying ambiguities open, especially with how Trog's function in a 2-3 player or in a 4 player game. It's a short manual - they should have included 2 pages on the trog's alone. That said, I like how trog's DO function in the game quite a bit, especially with 2 players.

I honestly do not see what the hype was about, felt very average.Your actions are dictated by cards, and most of the time they are very restrictive. Some abilities seemed OP(Place token anywhere on the board). Literally any other Area Control like multiplayer Wargame is better. Blood rage/Kemet/Nexus OPs I believe are much better.

EDIT : Seems to be ok for 4 players. This game requires more playthroughs to understand.Probably 4 players is also a must. Hopefully the upcoming expansion will unlock its true potential.

I want to like this game, with its clever combat and unique player powers. Unfortunately, in every game I've played, the humans won in a landslide. I've heard that the game is balanced once everyone has a good understanding of the strategy, but I don't see myself ever getting to that point - I'm not going to invest that much time into a game that isn't balanced and fun as a new player.

Solid game that feels more area-control-ish than some of the other more modern area control hybrid games like Blood Rage. Somehow not as immersive thematically as I had hoped. Didn't like the asymmetrical nature of the factions as much as I would have liked. Combat is fresh but you figure out pretty quickly which combat choices are best in different situations. A lot less to delve into than originally meets the eye in that regard.

Despite these minor issues, love the game. The length of the game is probably what will get it to the table over some others. Short and sweet. Need to truly optimize your turns. Love the Trog faction. Plays great with two.

This game is awful.  To me it is like a cake that was taken out of the oven about ten minutes too early.  There are some good ideas here, but overall the game is just not done.  It is so unbalanced and so uninteresting that I am sorry that I bought into the hype of this hot mess.

RATING: 5.5
The combat mechanic is clever, but the card and board play just wasn't very interesting to me.  You seem awfully constrained by the strengths of your faction, and there isn't much you can do beyond building a few things and fighting a few times.  I'd much rather play Nexus Ops for this kind of game, or play a light Civ game like Olympos, or play Kemet for a more interesting type of light wargame.

It is very possible I just had a negative first play, and I'd definitely try it again, but I was not very impressed.

Didn't love it.  Went in with a positive attitude determined I was going to love it.  Bloodrage with player powers and a super highlighted combat system.  We played 3 players, so the Trogs faction was AI with a little play from the player to your left.  First issue was understanding your powers.  Since 1.5 players didn't really understand what to do with their faction it was difficult to get a reading how it would play out with more tension on each player.  But even aside from that, Trogs seemed to spawn at a consistent rate, with little to no variability.  Either two or three are going to come out and try to ruin your day.  After that, the battles themselves had little to no excitement since we just mainly battled Trogs.  The player to your left controls the Trogs and will just screw you over as much as they can (as they should), since they have no attachment to the Trogs faction in the slightest.  Battle's between players (far rarer) had much more pressure to make good decisions.  They had substance and consequences to choices.  If the game was all that (i.e. a 4 player game) I think it would be much more interesting.

So in conclusion I think I need to play at 4 players, but I don't think i would push for it after the 3 player experience.  We'll see what happens.

2 to 4 players are trying to control territory and obtain crystals on a planet.  Reminds me of the Avatar movie, but with up to 4 sides.  The game has a deck building mechanic as well as an area control mechanic.  The game features one of the most interesting combat mechanics I have ever seen.  Combat is deterministic although players have the option to play cards that affect combat.  In each combat, the attacker and defender each assign their units to each of the three combat objectives, control territory, kill enemy units and capture enemy units.  Majority wins for each objective.

An intriguing dudes-on-a-map game that moves along at a refreshingly brisk pace. There is lots of chrome here, but it doesn't bog the game down. The real problem is that this is a genre that typically isn't my cup of tea. And of course there is still the possibility for a kingmaker problem that feels personal because it will come in the form of an attack.

Maybe it's because I've played two other games that prominently feature miniatures (Blood Rage and Scythe) that are both significantly better games, but I find Cry Havoc just a few steps above ok.  

What it does:  packs a lot of game into a short time (it flies by, almost leaving you with a "that's it?" sense).   It also provides a quicker alternative to Nexus Ops (though, to be clear--they are different games).  The asymmetric powers of the different races play well together, providing a good sense of interlocking theme and story.

RATING: 3
Chaos in the Old World is one of the greatest games ever made, so I was incredibly excited that another completely asymmetric four-player dudes on a map game was coming out. Though there's a lot to like here, we ran into some issues.

First is the balance. This has been discussed on the forums a lot and Portal has already erratted one card to help with a specific balance issue, but it still seems like the factions aren't completely balanced. I'm not ready to say the game is completely broken, but I can say that my group would never play this enough to get to a point where the factions feel equal, if that's even possible. Playing a four-player game where half of the players don't feel like they can compete isn't very fun.

There's also the aspect of a variable number of rounds. I like this idea in general, being able to dictate the length of the game to some extent, but it seems to contribute to a runaway leader. If someone gets really far ahead the game becomes shorter, so the other players now have less time to respond and catch up. This also ties into faction balance because it seems like the weaker factions, the Machines and Pilgrims, need more time to build up.

Another issue is the number of rounds/actions. At most you will have 15 actions and you'll likely have less than that. So right away this game is all about action efficiency instead of crushing faces. I prefer the CitOW/Blood Rage method of playing until you're out of power, or the Nexus Ops/Kemet method of playing to reach a certain point threshhold. In those games you can pull off some big surprise moves to shake things up or come from behind, but in Cry Havoc you just have to work with your few actions and the cards that you drew.

The last thing is that there can be a good amount of luck with the cards. In one game, the Trog player was able to very quickly spread out and cover a huge amount of the board in the first round, but he didn't have his "Enable Scoring" card so he missed out on a lot of points. He ended up coming in second but would have won with those extra points. There are also times when you might need to do a big single action, but you just happen to have cards that only let you do a few small actions.

It's not all negative, though. While I prefer dice combat, the combat system here feels unique. And despite the possible imbalances the factions do all feel very different from one another.

Unfortunately the issues will keep me from reaching for this over any similar games. If I want a good asymmetric dudes on a map game there's CitOW. If I want cardplay and diceless combat there's Blood Rage. If I want action efficiency there's Scythe. If I want just a solid dudes on a map fight there's the classic Nexus Ops. I'll probably try this again when they release the inevitable second edition (this is Portal Games afterall), but until then I'll be fighting it out in other games.

Update: A more recent game called Assault of the Giants came out and has blown away Cry Havoc. AotG has similar asymmetry and some similar card play, but the game feels like it was much better developed. Of course, there's always Chaos in the Old World too. Between AotG and CitOW, I don't see any reason to play Cry Havoc.

This feels like Nexus Ops with different races per player. Each of the four factions offers a unique way to play the game. 

The combat resolution is one of the major draws of this game and lets the winner get something out of battles as well. While combat is fairly straightforward, I've found that there are some bluffing elements to combat as well.

The board changing depending on player count keeps the game balanced and tight. 

Shame the Troggs are only playable when there are 4 players.

RATING: 8
Great game,  But several Rules clarifications had to be looked up, slowing first game play.  Could have benefited from a few more edits, and more clarifications in the rules.  I understand the need to streamline rule books, but when a game has different factions, with different abilities and rules.  they should include a few pages at the end of rule book, that goes over details of different abilities, and token what ifs?  

Like ties for most crystals - no addressed, Trogg retreating clarifications, like What if a Trogg token is there, do you still place a nest?  These type of questions, as examples come up a lot during game play, simple clarifications that undoubtedly came up in play-testing.  Yes we can assume, and we can use logic, but why frustrate players, just address it in the rule book.  Several of these have been addressed early in the forms sections, and an errata/FAQ have been added in files, but frustrating out of the box, and having to research during game time.   

With all of that said, once clarified, the game is really fun, and has a really cool battle system.  Great minis too!

Played a couple of 2 player games so far and really enjoyed the game. The 5 rounds really fly by and the combat board adds a nice bit of tension to the battles.

Some of the terrain cards are better than others and can sway the outcome of a battle but I think it's possible to see that coming and to plan for an opponents tactics. The card limit at the start of a turn seems a bit low to actually get the game fired up, so the starting turns feel a bit limited.

I don't think it's up there with Inis and Cyclades for me but I do think it's a very good game.

Have only played this once.  I feel like it would get better the next time around.  When we played, we felt we played our roles/factions incorrectly - or the game incorrectly as we tried to win without much conflict amongst the factions.  The battle system in this game is awesome.  The concept is cool.

Update - played a second time and it did in fact get better.  Learning to play the factions correctly increases the interest in this game.  Increased rating by a full point!

This would be a decent game if you could find a consistent group of 3/4 people to play it with. However, this is a terrible pick-up game for public groups. The strategy is obtuse, in part due to the variable factions, and the fact that each faction is expected to counter another faction compounds the issue.

Has all the problems that you expect for non-symmetric war games.  The factions are not balanced, and if two players fight a bitter war, they essentially give away the game to those who don't fight.  I can't understand why people love this so much.

Some neat stuff, some bad stuff. Rules complexity does not mirror level of gameplay. Things like the variable game length seem pasted on. Too fiddly for what it offers on the tactical and strategic level. There are only so many decisions but more rules and nitpicks. You can have the same in a more streamlined setting. Not a bad game, but there are better ones out there. Dry battles kills it off for me. I wish there would have been dice to break up things.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A deeply asymmetric area control game that is focused and fast-paced with little or no margin for error. Every action is meangingful and because of that the game does play a bit unforgivingly as you learn the nuances and depth of decision analysis (be forewarned that bad decisions can leave you completely out of the game but conversely clever play can turn the tides).

Excellent use of turn order manipulation where different factions have competing rationales for going first last or in-between. Multi-use cards that force tough decisions about how to best use your cards for actions or save them for battles. A battle system with a balanced blend of determinism and bluffing to allow for clever, surprising play.

While simple to play every game leaves me analyzing my decision set and learning more and more about what I could have done to play better. An intriguing design that is a challenge to master but remains engaging and fun to explore even while losing.

Good, asymmetric, dudes-on-a-map game. Although, a given set of special powers and therefore to some extent playing-style is forced upon you from the beginning, it is not too restrictive. Better than Chaos In The Old World, but nowhere near as good as Inis, Blood Rage and Kemet.

This game is exactly what I needed. Where I found Blood Rage so unpredictable due to huge VP swings made by combos in last age and Kemet kind of simplistic and maybe even dull, Cry Havoc combines ever interesting combat mechanic (you can still manage some form of victory even when outnumbered), form of predictability but asymmetric races and interesting choices all the game through.

Some say it is unbalanced but my opinion is that there are just different learning curves. Playing time that is around two hours with new comers or thinkful players is also big hit for me. 

Components are great and you can feel the love designers and publisher put into this. Cannot recommend more!

This has become one of my top 5 games.  At first, I thought it was poorly balanced but, after more plays, I began to see the various strategies for each of the factions.  This is a simple game mechanically but very challenging strategically and tactically.  Each faction plays totally different and you must play them a few times to even begin to exploit their strengths in order to be competitive.  I love how quick it plays for a game with such strong strategic choices.  My one complaint is that I almost feel it is too short, especially if someone jumps out to a big lead.  At times, I feel like I'm just getting my machine humming and then the game ends.  Maybe that is what keeps me wanting to come back and play again.  This is one of those games that leads to post-play dissection and discussion about what could have been/be done differently to do better next time.

The rating reflects my first impressions only, there's no way to fully understand the interplay between all the factions and their abilities during the initial play (which was all about understanding the rules and the basic concepts of combat and scoring points). I've barerly scratched the surface.

There are things I already love about it, but there are also things I absolutely hate. I definitely need more plays to form a final opinion (which I guess is a good thing as it shows that the game has much to offer). I really want to give it another shot!

Good area control game.  The asymmetry is neat - each faction feels totally different from the others.  The multi-use cards are pretty awesome as well.  Combat is one of my favorite combat systems in any game, as even if you're going to lose control of an area, you can squeeze some VP's out of it anyway.  I don't know that it's better than Kemet or Blood Rage, but it's definitely worthy of some playtime ... if only I had a group willing to play it.

Rating based on one play.

I like some of the ideas in this game, such as the tactics card attainment and battle system. Pretty cool miniatures, too. I have absolutely no idea how balanced the factions are, but it's cool how different they are.

That said, this game isn't exactly my style. I see it as a perfectly fine game, but I'm just not a fan of games in which everyone has to keep everyone else constantly in check. You are very dependent on your fellow players, and if one of them has the 'screw it, I can't win, I'm just gonna attack you so you won't win either' mentality , you're screwed. It's the same reason I have a love/hate-relationship with the GoT boardgame. 

Also, I'm doubtful about how much variety there is going to be when it comes to difference in strategies within the factions themselves. The blue dudes play defensively. They don't have much reason not to. So I'm somewhat wary of that. 

Ultimately, I guess I would play again, but don't think I'd suggest it myself. For me personally, I prefer Blood Rage as a dudes-on-a-map game with card play.

I was probably the one to enjoy this game the most when we played it. I found it interesting, full of decisions to make and thematically awesome. I have however found one thing being problematic, which is that you´re kind of stuck on your end taking minimal risks until you can strike hard. Problem is, if you don't do this at the right time, the  you end up in a situation where you are exposed, so that other players punish you for trying to break the stalemate. I don't quite like this aspect, as certain races will just try to sit there and only respond to direct threats, while others really need the combat to gain points and therefore risk themselves a lot more than them. Another thing is that once the players have built enough structures on the board, it is difficult to evaluate the situation to a point where you no longer consider invading certain regions because it's just too much work to figure it out.
Othetwise neat combat system, and nice abilities. I would play it again no questions asked, but I think it requires all players to be at around the same level to really enjoy.

Állandó konfliktusokkal teli, érdekes és sztem totál egyedi harcrendszert használó területfoglalós, aszimmetrikus játék. A karakterek, illetve a hozzájuk kapott épületek tulajdonságai nagyban meghatározzák a sikerességünket, így érdemes ahhoz igazítani a stratégiánkat. Van benne potenciál, ráadásul ketten is teljesen jól működik állítólag a kétoldalas tábla miatt.

One of my favorites from the past year, I absolutely love the way the game unfolds. Each faction being very different encourages experimentation and can't wait for the expansion to hit.

good dudes on a map game. Really like the asymetric gameplay. You would think that some factions are OP'ed, but they are rather easier to play (good for beginners).

This game is an aggressive style of playing, so take it into account when playing against "bad losers" (you know... the kind that take attacks to personal :-))

Difficult to have a good tactic/strategy if you play this the first time. 
Best to play more with the same group. Must play more.

Citow style game with asymmetric factions. Best things about the game : 
* Innovative battle system 
* RTS feel with buildings
* Unique playstyles 
* Card management and light deckbuilding
* Pinning by starting battle = very tactical choices
* More battles = more points generated at location
* Terrain cards with battle ability spice up the battle   system even more
* Many tactical possibilities

What I dislike the most : 
* Too easy to play factions versus very hard to play factions
* Mechanism to shorten the game is unnecessary and feels unfair for the harder to play factions (will play without this as it is easy to ignore) 
* 3-player game : trog nests are a bit too much of a roadblock, prevents players from moving at each other maybe a bit too much. 
* factions might be strategically railroaded too much and feel more like a tactical game.

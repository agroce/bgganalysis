GAME: The Guns of Gettysburg
RANK: 1348
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Only a few learning games so far, so very tentative rating. The oft-mentioned rulebook is very dense and impenetrable; a lot of specific rules are left implied where another writer may expand on them so their intention and effect is stated explicitly. There are a lot of detailed moving parts that come together and sort of weave a game in aggregate, which feels unusual, makes it very difficult to grasp the whole of the game and is just plain unintuitive. The game is quite clever, though, and gives a sweeping sense of the battle. It feels very 19th century, it feels very linear musket warfare (yes I know there were no muskets at Gettysburg), but has a blunt brutality to the combat that a Napoleonic game may lack, as it should.

The first play was really just an introduction to the pieces and system concepts.
The second play was a full solo game down to the wire with the Confederates just failing to be able to take the last (Eastern) VP hex from the Iron Brigade.  one more hour and they would have a 50/50 chance to do it (depending on the replacement to the IB in the first attack).  Two withdrawal orders used by the Union on the 3rd, and no Attack Moves until that day, only March and Reinforcment (and Cav. withdrawal).

An excellent game that gives a real commanders sense for corps integration, gathering of assets (do I attack now with what I have or wait till later when we both have reorganised somewhat), and where (and when) to place ones Divisions.
The use of deciding Turn time is a wonderful thing to keep the pace high, and then slow it down for combat, but more importantly to model the initiative of the side with the initiative.  It lets you hurry around the other and leaves them wondering where to block, where to fall back and where to.

Wonderful.

The only drawback is that the novelty of the procedures (and the consicity of the explanations) mean it takes more input to get ones around it than most other systems.  As such it will be inclined to receive more or less play depending on a greater likelyhood of prejudice on the part of possible opponents.
People are more likely to be afraid of this one than something more familiar, and even if trying to play it their prior habits may tend to block comprehension.

The game mechanics are unique, and the board is gorgeous. There were several manufacturing defects in my copy, but the reason for the relatively low rating is the rulebook. The rule mechanics are good, but the rulebook does not make it easy to learn. The rulebook is poorly organized for finding rules in the middle of the game, which is a pain because there are a few small, short but crucial rules that are easy to miss. Our first game took over 7 hours. A better rulebook or an excellent player's aid card would make this a real gem of a game. Right now, it's a bit rough around the edges.

Guns of Gettysburg is a clever, innovative approach to the famous battle, from its victory objectives that move dependent on the relative speeds at which reinforcements arrive, to the artillery chits that add uncertainty to a luck-free combat system and cleverly model the capacities of units to effectively engage in combat.

My problems start with the rules.  Bowen Simmons' rules have always been hard to digest.  Like Doug Adams says, every word is important and what's more there is no helpful recapitulation or cross referencing. Learning this system is really hard work.  

On top of that, Simmons' combat systems have grown progressively more tortuous since the delightful minimalism of Bonaparte at Marengo.  Doubt me?  Check the two-page flow chart in the GoG files section.  More hard work.

Add to that the variable arrival of reinforcements that really can change the nature of the battle.  A first day in which the bulk of the Confederate forces did not turn up until the evening may have been an historical possibility, but made for a couple of dull, uneventful hours of play (this really isn't a three hour game). 

Production quality is lavish from the mounted board to the racks for your artillery counters and two copies of the rules.  The artwork is well done too; this is perhaps the easiest to read of Simmons' maps.

This game is amazing.  I thought it was like Napoleon's Triumph but it is even better.  There are so many groundbreaking aspects that make complete thematic sense.

RATING: 9.5
This is an aesthetically beautiful game.  A gorgeous map and blocks representing the infantry and cavalry that line up reminiscent of old maps of this battle.  The rules are concise, elegant, succinct and dense.  It will take some work to grasp certain subtleties, but nothing too onerous.  Certainly not with help from an experienced player and/or the folks at the GoG BGG forum.  The one thing that keeps it from getting a 10 is there is some assembly required when you first buy the game.  Putting the stickers on the blocks is a tedious process.  It isn't especially hard, but requires patience with detail work.  If it came ready to play out of the box, it would get a 10 from me.

RATING: 8
Interesting game that grew on my as I played it.  I'm generally not an abstract fan so it's taking some getting used to.  Also Simmons is coming from a whole different world as far as wargame design is concerned, but that's not a bad thing.  The troop arrival mechanism and the bombardment tokens are nice ways of implementing fog of war.  

My biggest gripe is that because of the design of the game boundaries, the backs of your troops are sometimes exposed to the other player as you line them up.  We handled this by sometimes rotating the blocks, sometimes putting them face down, and then finally rotating the map as the front stabilized along a different access.  Annoying,but not a huge deal.

I thought that the component quality was uniformly very good.  I didn't think twice about the slight roughness of the token holders.  The box is definitely very heavy duty.

RATING: 9
What Bowen Simmons has done with this game is twofold:

1) She has revolutionized how map movement and terrain work on a board game. Regimental combat has not been done in this way since I was playing Warhammer, and she's managed to do it without the use of tape measures and fiddly charge rules. Whether or not Warhammer was a part of her design process (and I don't believe it was according to her dev diary) she's certainly ported the strategic decisions you feel there onto a wonderfully mounted game board.

2) She's introduced the right amount of variance to where you have to make strategic decisions to limit your losses based on fluidly arising map conditions without the use of dice or wonky catch-up mechanisms. To me, this is huge. You CAN get screwed by reinforcements in this game, but if it happens you feel as if it's a condition of the battlefield that you need to overcome. You CAN get screwed by not drawing the correct artillery tokens, but you are never surprised by the sudden lack of artillery. In games where you have dice as a mechanism for your RNG, your best laid plans that were carefully thought out based on board position can be shattered due to nothing but dumb luck. 

All in all, this game is phenomenal and worth every moment spent navigating the incredibly dense rulebook.

The Guns of Gettysburg – Bowen Simmons
 
                With the release of Guns of Gettysburg: A Bowen Simmons Boardgame, Mercury Games has released what can already be considered a classic.  The first thing which is striking about this game is the presentation of the components.  Many times, the boxes of board games are flimsy and tend to collapse on themselves after time.  This box here, is a quality product which feels strong in the hands.  Also, on the edge of the box are pictures of many commanders of the army during the Battle of Gettysburg.  Next is the board of the actual game.  Like the box, it is thick and will last through many years due to the quality products used to make this game.  The pieces are a solid wood and the cardboard counters are solid.  It was the pieces which were the finishing touch for the quality product which Mercury Games has produced for the hardcore war gamer.  All in all, this game is beautiful.

                Next, was the actual gameplay itself.  Unlike the actual battle, which many other games tend to recreate, this game creates a different experience for the Battle of Gettysburg.  Historically, General John Reynolds would be the first Union Infantry corps to arrive.  However, in my first game, General John Sedgwick arrived on the field first who, in reality, arrived on the field much later.  This set up gives the players a different outlook on the battle, however, there are rules set for historical reinforcement set up.  During my first game, it was a bit disconcerting that the historical elements of the game were not present, however with the addendum of the historical reinforcements it gives the players the touch of the actual battle if they want one.  Many people say that the Battle of Gettysburg was a battle meant for General Lee to lose.  What Bowen Simmons has done is attempt to create a situation where Lee could have possibly won.  A word of warning to many.  Though the box states that the game is three hours long, the first time through will most likely be around five to six hours of gameplay (not that I’m complaining.)

                Bowen Simmons has created the dice-less system which he has used in his previous games, especially his Napoleonic games.  The system works great in the Gettysburg game with the added element of the artillery.  This system bases your movements purely on strategy and tactics without relying on the hopes of the dice.  With the artillery element added, the players have the chance to pump up their attacks and duel before the infantry assault begins.  Another one of the interesting points of the game is the arrival of the troops.  During many of the game rounds I played before writing this review, the players ran into trouble by having multiple hours with no arrival of troops.  This places a strain on the objectives the Union needs to keep in order to win.  This also makes the game interesting and can give the players an outlook of how the battle could have gone.
 
                This game works well with two players, and it is actually best with two players.  There is an option for four players, but the command structure becomes awkward with the teams and the lack of communication between the two.  The general commanding has many responsibilities when organizing the turn, however the subordinate does not have to listen making their own decisions on the field of battle.  This, I thought, was a very good showcase of the actuality of the conflict.  Don’t be fooled by the term subordinate for there are some points in the gameplay which places the subordinate in a more supreme place of power.    

                While Bowen Simmons has been highly regarded for his work with his Napoleonic games, I think he has found a good stride with his work in the American Civil War.  Simmons even states in his design notes at the back of the rulebook, that this battlefield was a bit different because of the terrain of Gettysburg.  The rules are a bit complex for even the most trained war gamer, but when things begin to move, the action becomes intense and enjoyable.  I applaud Simmons for his first trip to the world of early Modern Warfare mixed with Napoleonic tactics.  Let us hope that this is not his last venture into this genre.

RATING: 9
Initial Impression: This, more than almost any other wargame I own, is less of a simulation of the actual battle and more of a "what-if". The designer has incorporated many interesting mechanisms to the game, my favorite being the moving objectives. This is definitely a game of maneuver and positioning. I look forward to playing this game many more times so I  can become comfortable enough with the rules that they become second nature.

10 Plays: After the 4th play, the rules had sunk in and now I've moved on to learning the strategy. As a Gettysburg noob I find the toughest thing to grasp is identifying the most advantageous terrain.   My proficiency with cavalry is getting better. I'm hoping to learn how to best play the Union within the next few sessions.

Outstanding. Always want to play.

What makes this game so good:
No dice.
No event cards.
Randomness is injected by: the drawing of battle tokens; troop arrival times; and troop arrival locations.
Important decisions re. the composition of your troops; the formation of your troops; the movement of your troops; use of the terrain; when, where and with whom to attack.

The only drawback is the rule book - get over that and it is a magnificent game. IMO the rule book is too succinct and makes it hard to learn the game. All the information is there but it could have been laid out better to emphasise important concepts. The economy of words doesn't help in grasping difficult or complex situations that arise while playing.

Beautiful game if you enjoyed the battle maps (like I did).  Different than the old hex and counter games that I had played.  I enjoy that, with the fronts and the flanking, etc.  It made sense to me.  I had only played day 1 so far so my rating is based upon that and what it can be.  It's been a long time since I played a real war game and I'm glad it's this one.  Been waiting for this one a long time.

Owing Mercury Games version. Still playing - this is another masterpiece from Bowen Simmons.
Balance problems - Union has hard edge to win.
After 20 plays, some supplement is needed. Union can win, but it need some experience in play and some help with random factors, which drive dynamics of this game.
Two mentioned random factors are:
1) losses - randomization of losses is good, but it may seriously hamper Confederate staying power, which is side with initiative and must attack. Confederates have more units, where are 50% chance to stay with 2-strength unit after attack where losses are taken.
2) reinforcement track - this factor decide where combats will be fought, so every game is different, but some reinforcements configurations ease one of the sides job.
Great game, but one must consider, that randomization sometimes could be problematic.

Waiting for this one to be released.  I will purchase this even if I hear negative reviews about the game because Bowen Simmons's production quality is so high, I want to encourage other game companies to follow suit.  That being said, I dont' think Bowen has turned out a bad game yet - and this will be his third game in the evolution of his diceless combat system.

My rating of 6.5  feels very harsh, but the rating system is linear and my feelings about the game are non-linear!

First, the game design is of masterful precision, and along with the superb component quality, should make it one of the great wargames. But for me, after 4 plays, it feels too much like an intricate chess-like puzzle to be solved, and does not evoke enough of the blood and thunder I expect from a great wargame.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This wargame is a masterpiece of the genre, and I don't use that term lightly.  The game is beautiful, the components are great, and the gameplay (once mastered) is very elegant.  Most importantly, the gameplay feels like a civil war era battle.  The units move and attack in ways that feel thoroughly appropriate for the era.  In other words, the mechanics and theme seem to be in perfect balance and agreement.

This game is certainly not a light game and, though the rule book is not long it is incredibly dense -- every clause of every sentence has meaning.  Still, for those willing to make the commitment of learning this game's systems, the reward is an amazing experience.... amazing.

Back in my collection. Comments and a more permanent rating after more play. Still after six plays get rules-confused. Finding play more enjoyable though than Napoleon's Triumph, probably because I know a tiny bit more about the US Civil War (and the three-day battle at Gettysburg, specifically) than I do the Napoleonic battles and combatants. The backwards contour colouring bothers me as a geography/art major. I consider GoG a brilliant design, so we'll see where the final rating winds up.

I can't rate this game very well on the BGG scale, so I'll confine myself to a comment. This is an interesting and unique design with some elements that are brilliant. The designer appears to have accomplished their stated aims. It is a tight, tense, fun and challenging game. 

But as a depiction of an American Civil War battle, it leaves me cold. I found in this game very little of what I think of as an ACW battle. For me the game tactics are something unto themselves, with little connection to ACW tactics. Anyone with an interest in the subject should try it, however, and judge for themselves.

Like other Simmons' games, GoG can be tough to digest at first, but once it clicks, it everything seems to fall into place.  GoG is probably tougher to wrap one's head around than its predecessors.  But it is a quality game that I believe captures the spirit of Gettysburg and the Civil War battlefield quite well.  It provides a tense and exciting game experience and the two armies anxiously await reinforcements and try to outmaneuver one another on the field.

I want to like this game more than I actually do. Perhaps with time that will come. What it does offer, though, is the challenge of a maneuver-based battle, with random reinforcements, and a need to amass and manage artillery carefully to support the critical offensive and defensive actions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
What a brilliant and innovative game design!

I give this a 9 after a full day of two of us playing through most of July 1st twice, after reading the rules in their totality.

After reading the rules my head did hurt, but after pushing the blocks around for a few hours the elegance of this design really started to shine.

I love the way the entire meeting engagement at Gettysburg is managed complete with mobile (!) victory point areas depending on how slowly the Union reinforcements arrive. The General Orders and Initiative are a game within a game and the Battle Tokens and Artillery process model so many things with such simplicity that's it's a marvel to behold...all with no dice or "Random Events Tables".

This game will be a 10 rating if it continues to impress after a dozen playings. Everyone who calls themselves a wargamer MUST buy this game and savour its incredible innovative approach to this over-gamed battle.

EDIT: After a dozen plays I rate this a 10 - one of the best wargames of all time. See my review.

RATING: 8
Players take on either the Union or Confederates, and attempt to defeat the other side at the battle of Gettysburg.  Lovely, clean looking game from Bowen Simmons, with a gorgeous, function map, and quality wooden blocks representing brigades.  The game follows a very straightforward turn structure, that allows four different types of movement - withdrawal, attack, reinforcement and march.  Blocks move across areas of various shapes, designed to model the terrain crossed, and end their move in positions which have various terrain features that dictate combat.  Attacks are handled by deploying artillery resources from behind a screen, handling the uncertainty of whether an attack will come off very nicely.  Once the action gets under way, the blocks melt away very quickly through a nice reduction system.  The Confederates win if they can take and hold one of three objectives (that actually move around the battlefield if the Confederates have more forces on the board early in the game - nice!).  The Union win if they can deny victory to the Rebels.  

After two games, this appears to be a very impressive piece of work.  I love the subtle touches - the reinforcement queue entry system, the way the game board has been designed, the elegant combat/artillery resource chit system, and so on.  The rules are dense, and there is barely a wasted sentence.  Every word is important and several key concepts have to be read several times to get absorbed.  The best way to get into this game is to set it up and begin playing, re-reading and understanding as you go.  

Excellent stuff - the most important thing is ... this does feel like a Gettyburg game.  As the rules are mastered, you begin thinking about terrain, flanks, movement, objectives ... that's when you realise the designer has got it right.

Best game to emulate the uncertainty of the generals on those days. Never really know who is up on that ridge, or when your next reinforcement is getting to the battlefield, on the first day it is a mater of guess work, and then the next 2 days it comes down to a maneuver and timing battle. I think it's the best simulation of what it felt like on those days to command the 2 armies. Love it and highly recommend it to PHD Scholar to general history buff - its worth the time to learn the game.

Played this again, this time right through, It holds up well and most of my initial feelings remain. In our game the lines did settle out a bit on the second day and it becomes a game about timing and time management with the time track and the length of turns.

----------------------

I think I probably prefer this to Napoleons Triumph. It is more forgiving and feels more like its subject battle and less of an abstract. It is however longer and has a weightier rule set. 
A lot of manouvre on the first day with the Union cav positions being key, things then get bloodier in the afternoon and then again perhaps on day 2. I look forward to another game. The cannon chits can be a bit frustrating but the jockeying for position and tension of pulling the trigger is great.

RATING: 9
First impression: Map could be a bit larger. More rules than NT, but I find the rules more intuitive than NT, especially the attack procedure. 
Some mechanics seem a bit gamey and seem to have no real rationale except to steer the game into certain directions or balance things out. Like the +1 attack modifier for the confederates, the fact that all battle tokens are lost for the attacker, but not for the defender (shouldn't this be based on who won the attack instead) or the penalty of losing half your battle tokens if not attacking while under general attack order. The objectives are completely artificial, especially when they move around. They really represent morale instead of strategic objectives, as there were none in Gettysburg (the shoe factory is a lie). But of course using objectives instead of a morale track is more fun.
Someone called it a awkward masterpiece and I think that fits well.
It's still a 10 as I may have more fun with than with NT (NT is pure stress, I cannot play it too often).

The learning curve has a steep climb but worth the effort.   Every game has proven to be different from the last. The balance is tight.  After 2 learning games, Dan Winston and I have played 4 games, each taking the Union twice.  We have both won with each side.  The Confederate wins both taking late into July 3rd.  Very tense for a diceless game.

Each side plays differently too.  Learning the organization for asset matching is key.

So far we have found games take between 4.5 to 5.5 hours.

Wow. I must admit that I'm rather intimidated by this system. I've been afraid to give it a try thus far. But it will sit gathering dust if I don't. The board & pieces are splendid and look just like a ACW map when set up. But this system... very hard to get one's head around it- quite unintuitive, from my reading (of them). I'm afraid the game will be so abstract to the point where it detracts from the feeling of actually fighting the battle. But I'll need a play to really suss it out.

Love Simmons games. I like historical war-games, but no longer have the time for many-hour games with many, many charts. Simmons has a knack for clever mechanics that tweak the abstractions in typical war games. Not light, by any means, but approachable.

I like this better than Napoleon's Triumph for the added bits of randomness and the theme. (I have a soft spot for the ACW as a game subject.)

Rachel Simmons is a superlative wargame designer. Fascinating and engaging wargame. A deterministic combat system similar to the equally wonderful Napoleon's Triumph. However, introduces an resource management aspect to the game in the form of the artillery tokens.

This is a much cleaner game than Napoleon's Triumph, with some good mechanics for artillery and reinforcements. Other aspects of the period are factored into the design in some rather eloquent ways, such as the choice between pushing men forward or digging in for defense. The movement of the victory locations is perfect. That being said Simmons's rules writing is better here but still difficult to digest.

When I see media deploy the concept of a war on a table-top basis (e.g. Game of Thrones), I imagine that the characters portrayed are playing something akin a Rachel Simmons game. While this game runs a bit long (for my tastes), this seems to capture the swell and sink of a war -- the flows, and intensities which shape what can be done, what can, can't, when and where -- keeping the flow of options open. While this may never hit the table regularly for me, I can recognize the literal stroke of genius which produced this game (one might not have to read much further than the blogs Rachel keeps to gather insight into the multiple and rich design decisions therein).

Also, the positional play, when partnered with the hand management of the tokens (which might as well be cards) and the uncertainty of unit reduction make for a game of partial deduction, bluff, and bravado (see Mark Hermann's review for more on this). Again, I'm happy I played this -- there simply aren't that many games that focus this strongly on positional play that have such uncertainty.

In every sense of the word, this is perhaps the most beautiful game I've played: not only the components, but the system and the gameplay are just stunning. It doesn't attempt to simulate history as it happened, but it does an amazing job of giving a feeling of how the battle would unfold given the myriad uncertainties that surrounded it. The movement and battle system are intuitive and the moving objectives are excellent at maintaining balance. I find the game to be exquisitely complex in the sense that, while there are relatively few rules and chrome (for a wargame), the rules that are there interact with each other in extremely interesting ways. Thus the game is an challenge to play, presenting you with difficult decisions at every turn.

My only lament is that it has a long play-time and it doesn't solo well, so I don't get to play it as often as I would like. Also, while I don't find the rules to be very difficult overall, I do find it difficult to remember certain small rules, especially concerning the maintenance of your battle tray (when to discard/draw battle tokens in all the various situations); when these rules are not followed correctly, it can [i]severely[/i] disrupt the proper flow of the game.

Without a doubt a very fine wargame. Sometimes frustrating if one side or the other gets a significant influx of reinforcements early in the game. Overall though, one to own and play. If there is a problem it is that the rules need very careful reading which can make the game seem unduly difficult.

Just got it [June 2013]. Haven't figured it out yet. Looks good.

OK, I've played a test/learning game. Well only a half a game actually, just to the end of the first day. While overall the quality of the components is fine; there definitely were some issues with quality control. And some game play issues with some components. I'm sure Mercury Games will address these issues in future productions. And they were very cooperative in replacing damaged components. That being said, I really like the game. Very well crafted. I like all the different tokens (just a different type of card). Adds a nice random touch while keeping the combat dice-less/non-random. A nice combination. With the random bits, this makes for a good replayability. Each game will wind up being different. I think that this game has a very good likelihood of being one of my favorites if not my favorite.

I got to play a development version [i]with Bowen, at his house![/i]

I will buy anything he makes, so of course I kickstarted this, "but" I don't expect to like it as much as NT, simply because of [thread=973863]the style of battle[/thread], where you're dealing with a situation as it develops rather than laying out a plan at the start and seeing how your plan deforms on contact.  (And I don't like any of Mercury Games' cosmetic changes.)

UPDATE: after pushing the pieces around to get a feel for the rules, this sure [i]seems[/i] more complicated, or maybe less intuitive, than NT.  (Although maybe that's just because I'm more familiar with NT.)  Certainly [i]physically[/i] it's much more complicated than NT; there are lots of different kinds of bits which have to be arranged and stacked around the board in different piles, and even arranging the units themselves at the start of the game is more complicated.  This bleeds into the rules; e.g. to know whether you can use a Confederate corps artillery token, you have to know whether all the blocks of at least two commands in the corps have entered the map--not just become available--which may also mean checking the dead pile.

To simplify & speed the shuffling, I'm considering making a bunch of cloth bags--one for Union battle tokens, one for Union reinforcement tokens, one for Confederate battle tokens, one for Confederate reinforcement tokens, etc.--but I'm not sure whether this will get enough play to justify the effort.  Also considering making some custom trays to keep the units organized during play.  The only other game where I've had to experiment with that was EuroFront!

Rated after two plays. The rulebook is not not organized well at all and they're are too condensed. This all lends to the game having a very steep learning curve. 

Another criticism I have is about the reinforcement schedule. There's a built in mechanism to assist the Union if their reinforcements don't show up in a timely fashion, but this only works up to a point. In the first game I played, Confederate forces were very late to the battlefield and were crushed. In the second game, no Union reinforcements showed up until 6pm on the first day. It was too little, too late.

One of the best and most original games of the year. Please don't expect to open the game box, learn the systems, and play it without a problem on the day you get it. Some people can do that, no doubt, but I spent several days off and on with the rules and the forums here, took my time, and I think I have a pretty good handle on it. The most difficult concepts to visualize are the field of fire rules combined with the movement rules - once those are absorbed, the game is much less daunting.

Players who make the effort will be rewarded with a unique take on civil war battle, and Gettysburg in particular. Plenty of tension, as reinforcement arrival timetable is semi hidden and partially random from game to game. I love the objectives, which can move around the map, depending on the union reinforcement rate. It's kind of genius, really.

Really, this is a 10 game, but I gave it a 9 just because it is going to be a very difficult system to grasp for a lot of people. The rules are complete and good, but they aren't really welcoming to someone coming in to the design cold. I would rate this considerably harder to grasp than Napoleon's Triumph (also a fantastic game), simply due to the complexity that the field of fire rules add.

I knew about the other games from Simmons but never tried them.  I heard this was the best of the series, so I decided to bite the bullet (in this case, a real one from the Civil War that came with thebgame!) and try this.  What an excellent, excellent design.  Tense start to finish.  No dice, but you don't miss them.  Fascinating to see the armies dance about one another.  Amazing to see how we were looking at the actual map to plan moves, and not a hex terrain to cound movement points.  I cannot praise this highly enough.  Rating may even go up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's an interesting design, but I'm not sure it is the right battle for me. After an aborted play and then a full one, I feel like the only person who really has an interesting game is the Confederate player because depending on the reinforcement draws, the Union player is likely to end up camped out waiting for the Confederates to attack. I think it is a shame that there aren't any decisive victory conditions for the Union that can end the game early and instead you have to play the full game in order for the Union to win.

Very very good game, with a strong identity among Gettysburg's wargames (and not only). There are some inevitable abstractions, but I love the way you must focus on the actual [i]map[/i] rather than units' datas. Plus, there's a huge replay value (from the setup, where to place Bulford? to the reinforcements). 
Probably the best of the Simmons' designs, in my book; but also a step up in complexity from Napoleon's Triumph.

I finally got to play and own this long-awaited game. And it did not disappoint! My expectations were high after learning it's predecessors, Bonaparte at Marengo and the brilliant Napoleon's Triumph. It took some time and several plays to learn the rules, even if I knew the predecessors, but that was time well spent. Each game is an epic tale of the battle, hours of suspense and brain-burning.
Brilliant ways of handling the conditions on the battlefield. The random elements of when the units enter and when the artillery arrives, makes this a game of adapting and improvising. Even if the game often plays out along the same broad lines, there is enough variety to ensure a fresh and rewarding experience every time.

Lovely map. The playing pieces make the game look like the images in historical battle map books. The game seems very complicated to play.  I have set this game up then put it away un-played several times.

Fun, but didn't find a balance with our group. The normally superior strategy player struggled to do well and got very frustrated. Even with bidding handicap the North felt underpowered to do the job. That said, the map and pieces are satisfying; adding a tactile component normally not found in strategy games. Quicker than some large map games, but still and all day affair to play and easily susceptible to over-thinking/long turns. This leaves the opponent nothing to do but unable to walk away as every change is important.

It's not easy to convey how innovative and unexpected Simmons' design choices are.  As with her Napoleonic games, the bold originality of the system takes some getting used to.

For example, in most wargames, you cross hexsides and occupy hexes; in this game, you cross hexes and occupy hexsides. (Not hexes really, but you see the point.) And there's a lot that follows just from this changed understanding of movement.

The whole package fits together as a wonderful integration of terrain, unit capabilities, and fog of war.

Extremly innovative. Introduces new mechanics and principles, which is a rare experience in times of reprocessing reprocessed game principles.

The meeting engagement the game produces is very nice and I think it will take a lot of replays to build up expertise, but then the game will shine even more. Currently my most played game!

This is a brilliant design, it also happens to be the hardest game I've ever played (yes more than ASL).
I really like the way the battle unfolds, just like history where the two sides almost run into each other and the battle grows as more units enter the surrounding area.  The designer creates a somewhat random reinforcement schedule that is true to history while allowing for great re-playability.  He counters that with movable victory locations that (again) holds to history but allows for the variation of the reinforcements while keeping the integrity of the battle and tactics.

The rules appear to be straightforward but have layers and layers of meaning and intent that don't jump out at you until you try to play the way the rules read.  The diceless combat is interesting and a refreshing change from most wargames, once you get the hang of it. The map creates a very interesting movement dynamic that is not seen in any other game outside this designer.

Overall a brilliant game that needs a lot of effort and multiple plays in order to grasp all the nuances of the design. 
Unfortunately I just don't know if it's worth the work required to get through a battle.  Its so procedural and detailed that I find myself playing the system and not the battle.

[2 plays] We only played through the first day as we fumbled and tumbled our way through the learning process with this game. Definitely interested to play again soon and begin exploring more.

2nd play, same story. fumbling through rules written with far too few examples to help understand. I don't get the feeling I'm playing a game about the Civil War. I just feel frustrated that I'm struggling with a game system and shoving blocks around a beautiful map.

Sorry, at this point, it doesn't feel like there's a pay-off in terms of enjoyment vs. rule learnin'.

Bowen Simmons is a very exceptional designer. I am sure I'll love this one once I get to learn it.
The production quality is excellent, Mercury did a great job. Ignore the block sticking complaints, there is nothing to be afraid of here. Everything looks similar in quality with the designers previous efforts.

UPDATE> Rating after reading the rules, translating the most important parts in Greek, playing couple of solo games to learn and a few learning rounds with a friend. Normally it's a 10, but it gets 9 for 2 reasons:
 i. subject(indifferent-boring)
 ii. the most difficult rulebook in my board game career so far. Not exactly difficult, everything is explained but, how to put it better..... not very welcoming.

 However, the game is a true masterpiece. Maneuver, maneuver, MANEUVER all the way. Only the blue and red long wooden blocks on the light green map give it a finesse compared only to the designers previous games and literally nothing else in the market. I guess that if I play a few games perhaps it will take the perfect score it deserves.

My now favorite approach to a war game system applied to a battle where it allows any range to develop from very historical to very speculative.

A bit of a learning curve but not too bad.   Because the "locale" area, to use a Napoleon's Triumph term, has no function in this game in terms of block movement (that is, blocks do not inhabit "locales" but only the "approaches" or "positions" bordering the locales), the rules are a bit simpler than Napoleons Triumph, for me anyway.

RATING: 6
I don't care about the history of battles and have zero interest in the simulation value of these types of games. In real life, I don't believe that tactical decisions in a battle have much of an impact on the broader movement of history, and that is what I'm interested in. This is one reason why I love Twilight Struggle and 1989 as much as I do.  They give you the gestalt without worrying about the details.

So I had few expectations going into this game. I know [i]of[/i] a bunch of war games, and I've played my share of hybrids, but I'd never played any of the purer examples of the genre until this.

The game is an interesting positional dance where you're trying to outmanoeuvre rather than outgun your opponent. Attacking rarely seems worthwhile except to force a retreat.  To me the value of a game of this weight and length is largely about whether there are enough interesting decisions. Here, there are. I think. I'm not sure though, even after one play.

I understand from reading about the game afterward that my first play was about what you would expect time-wise.  It was a long game. The time on the box and on BGG is a lie. It's a long game. It's a good long game, but I'm not sure it's good enough that we'll have many opportunities to replay it. I would like to play again, but it's not going to be something I obsess about and make time to play the way I have with 18xx, the closest comparator for time to play. 

My main criticisms are that there's not much drama in the battle system. Choices and outcomes are rather constrained.  Also, the rules could have been streamlined. Granted, the game is surprisingly intuitive given the rules weight. It still could have used some editing.

[COLOR=#CC0033][b]Another masterpiece from Bowen Simmons. This feels like Gettysburg. The work that must have gone into this, to be able to capture the essence of the battle must have been substantial.  The variable reinforcement mechanism is ingenious, the permutations offer a different scenario each battle.  When I play this, I feel like either General Meade or Lee.  I can't give it a higher accolade.[/b][/COLOR]

First play - 7. We had a lot of thoughts after this first one. Mistakes were made, rules consulted, but we think we got everything right by the end. 

In Napoleon's Triumph you are always sweating about which unit you will be facing - and trying to move your own best troops into favourable positions. Here it's more the battle token tray that needs to be feared. And you can't manouver around that. You can keep track of tokens spent and so on, but it isn't as tense.

Min/maxing. After half a dozen plays of NT I got good at seeing what a position needed and could move accordingly, without too much counting. Maybe that will happen here as well, but I have to consult the tray before moving and then consider matching blocks and... More counting, less fluid. At least that's the feeling.

I like this. I want to play more. I don't know if it will become a favourite, or more of  nice piece of gaming.

It's not totally deterministic, a little luck in which arty tokens you draw. Indeed, those arty tokens are the key to the game. Heh, it's even in the title. Love this game so far, really love how it's not a slave to history but still feels like history.

I have never been more frustrated trying to learn a game, and I consider myself an adept navigator of dense rulebooks.  After an hour or so of play I still had no idea how combat worked, what I was supposed to be doing, or any of the usual things I'd want to know while playing a wargame.  A good example of play would have been very, very helpful -- I was beginning to think that my opponent was pulling some sort of elaborate prank, maybe in retaliation for dragging him into a game of High Frontier against his will.

But we finally got things to click, and once we did -- wow.  I haven't ever played anything quite like this.  I'm not going to rate it after just one play, but I was mesmerized, both by the gameplay and the visual presentation.  I haven't done a lot of ACW gaming but this just felt right in a way that other designs haven't.  Very impressed.

Bowen Simmons does it again. I feel like a fanboy saying that, but just getting the box in the mail I could already feel myself starting to gush over the design. The box artwork is period-perfect, without feeling dry and dull. It feels like Ken Burns' Gettysburg,: the Game. Simmons Games is continuing to innovate and create beautiful, elegant games with impeccable design. I am at a point where I would buy any game he made on name alone and feel relatively confident in that choice. It's rare for me to put any stock in a name alone, but once faith is earned, I won't hesitate to preach the gospel as hard as any true disciple. 

In any case, I need to find a game buddy for this one soon!

So far, I really love what he's kept from the Boneparte at Morengo and Napoleon's Triumph system, if such a thing can be said to exist and if one can call it that. It's more ephemeral and less consistent than, say, the Columbia block game system, but there is more than just an aesthetic similarity, but a real conception evolution. I don't mean evolution here in the positivist or progressive sense--that might be legitimately said if comparing Napoleon's Triumph to Boneparte at Morengo, but here I think we have more lateral change and innovation rather than what one could objectively see as improvement toward some ideal of perfection.

The use artillery as a sort of hand management wild card takes the deterministic combat and adds some chance to the equation, but chance that informs and either limits or enables player decision-making and resource allocation rather than being a random resolver for combat outcomes. I like that.

The unit positions only being on what were the approaches in the prior games, and with locales now defining a fields of fire concept (similar to, but distinct from any concept of "zone of control") is quite a departure from previous games and works better for the subject at hand. 

Varied reinforcements is an excellent simulation of "what if's", while also simulating the unknowns and uncertainties that drove the dilemmas facing the historical commanders.

Of course components are superb quality. They set the bar in my opinion for what wargames can and should look and feel like. There's been a switch to stickers for the blocks from the previous embossed blocks... that's a disappointment as I'm never glad to spend time assembling a game (plus stickers come off over time, etc). But on the plus side, they do look nice and add to the game even if you might personally prefer the old symbols. The different state flags is a great touch. The map is beautiful. Once again Simmons gives us a map that looks like a map, while having the quality of a first rate game. Feels serious, whereas a lot of wargames with higher production values seem to be tending toward the whimsical side of things (Strike of the Eagle and it's cartoonish art and map... it's gorgeous, but the style is more gamy and toy-like).

Command & control is revamped and the corps system from NT is gone. Sad, but understandable given the change in period and the specific design questions being answered. Will have to see how I feel about that later on.

The components are beautiful, but a bit too busy. This time, it didn't click for me the way Napoleon's Triumph did, the abstraction got in the way of my enjoyment and the results didn't feel right.

I bought this game after reading the rules online. The rule book is short, but the implications of the rules are both subtle and decisive.  Maneuvering to gain a slight edge in the deterministic battles is challenging and tense; the geography and possibility of the artillery can be intimidating.  The board and the rectangular blocks add a very nice feel to the game.

RATING: 10
A triumph of coding pre-mechanized battle into a tabletop game. A weird beauty in the making & breaking of formations, an aesthetic in thought that is disciplined & pure, true beauty of map & bits & tempo. It's conception of terrain is one of those true innovations that, once your mind learns to inhabit it, just makes you weep.

A masterpiece.

I struggled so much to learn this! When the time comes to return to it, I hope I can grasp it well again.

If someone could teleport the rules into my brain I'd be much more likely to play it.

I can't wait until the year 2257, when this will finally be possible.

[i]Update:[/i]

At last, I managed a partial play thanks to a run-in with a fan at a local convention. Our session covered the first third of the game (day 1 of 3), took 3.5 hours with rules explanation, and was engaging and enjoyable.

Don't assume that prior knowledge of Napoleon's Triumph will help you grasp Guns of Gettysburg - which is superficially similar - as that misstep will result in a fatal concussion.  The boards and blocks belong to the same species, but movement, combat, and other details of the two systems are radically different.

In our incomplete play, I was able to see GoG's potential, but I could also see its foibles. It's significantly longer, more fiddly, and more complex than NT, and I'm not sure that even one of those issues is acceptable, let alone all three.

My personal copy isn't even stickered yet, as I remain doubtful that I can fully understand or retain the rules without cognitive implants.  Though I'm slowly becoming convinced (maybe) that it's worth prepping my copy and removing it from the trade pile. It remains to be seen, however, whether I'll manage a full play in the next decade.

I will never play this again.  And away it goes...

Very meaty, very unique, very beautiful very thinky.  My take is that, of the myriad games on the topic, this is actually the best simulation of the battle.  Not because it will give you the historical results, but because it simulates the uncertainty that must have been going on that day.  You have very little idea of who will arrive on the battlefield at what time.  Artillery is abstracted and plays a crucial role.  It is wonderfully represented here.  As with most Simmons Games, the emphasis is on maneuver, in a way that no other game on the topic I have seen can address that aspect.  The way your troops come on the field and slowly get locked in to their positions after you commit them is extremely tense and very thematic.  Just a great and unique experience, IF you can wrap your head around it, that is.  This is not for the faint of heart, this one requires an enormous effort.

As novel and interesting a design as Napoleon's Triumph, but a bit more intuitive and objective-based. The way the uncertainty of the reinforcements is modeled really highlights the opportunistic nature of the historical battle.

It's much longer than Napoleon's Triumph though if you end up playing the full 3 day affair.

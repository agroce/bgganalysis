Fun, quickly paced pick-up-and-delivery with many different aspects: Auf Achse like purchase contracts (but for exclusive Ticket-to-Ride like routes that you build and get points completing). Rolled dice with colors for faces generally that serve as currency. 

Three phases to the game that slowly open up more delivery spots and goods to be delivered for points. Bonus points for quick delivery goods on shorter routes and vice versa. 

The game after one play seemed to move at a wonder pace until the last phase, but that could be a direct result of my trailing last place finish. I would most certainly play again. I had fun being reminded of Union Pacific/Clippers and Age of Steam, too but it is distinctly different and definitely worth a play. 

2nd play (two player; Texas map): This is growing on me. Want to find it easier to ship over farther links, but that doesn't mean the game should make it easier for me.

Making the decision to back this one on Kickstarter was a wise choice.  

Excellent and involving game play that keeps your attention, even during other player's turns.  Down time is minimized and there are meaningful decisions to be made throughout the game.  Even though the dice play a major role in your decision making, chance really doesn't drive the game...there is definite strategy involved in making LOTS of decisions.

Rolling Freight is a solid game. I especially enjoy the die rolling mechanism as you really have to carefully plan out how to use your dice each turn. Do I invest in awesome improvements now or try to get cheap contracts to build up my points and so that other players are forced to use my tracks? Tough decisions, I like those! I also really like how the boards slowly open up as the game changes phases. My only negatives would be component based as the players rail sticks are usually not a good fit for the lines you finish. Also, the Southeastern U.S. map can take along time, so be prepared. Our 4 player game took about 5 hours. Just misses out in a Top 100 spot for me.

Rolling Freight is very enjoyable.  It is very similar to Steam, which I own, but is feels quite different.  It feels lighter, and it does not make my head hurt.  I do not play it very often, but when I want a heavier game that does not make my head hurt, I turn to Rolling Freight.  It fills an odd niche in my collection, and I greatly enjoy having the game.

Too long for what it is... Analysis Paralysis may be a problem with some players since you might have to wait until it is your turn to make decisions.

...and then, the randomness that occurs. It can be mitigated, but not all of the time. 

While playing this, I was thinking, towards the end, of why I wasn't playing Age of Steam or Steam. There are interesting and innovative mechanics, but they would have shined better with less downtime and length of game.

Enjoyable game that we played with 5 players (4 new) and it took way too long.  The last half of the game dragged on forever (4 hours) as there was some AP.  I would say the sweet spot is 3 or 4.  The game itself was quite good and I liked the improvement cards and how they add additional dice and powers to players.  Also, the bonus for cargo delivery is a good design element.

I have dropped my rating by at least 1 point due to the length with 5 players.  I will give this another try with 3 or 4 next time.

It's a train game played with lots of dice... but there's a decent amount of strategy for claiming routes and setting yourself up to do long deliveries like Age of Steam.  With all of it's moving parts, there was a lot of luck and much depended on what was left after the other players, making it difficult to plan your moves even though you got to roll your dice in advance so you could plan ahead.

Anyway, our 1st play took a total of 4 hours.  With a timer, it could be decent... but you'd still have to contend with fiddlyness since certain parts of the board (like the "in demand" goods for cities) are very hard to see.

Was not crazy for this with 3 players.  THe game seemed to take too long for what it was.  With 2 on the Texas map it was excellent and I look forward to playing it again -- either with 2 on the small map or with 4 or 5 on the bigger map.

RATING: 7
Just played the Texas map for 2 players. Few minor errors while playing. Grade can go up or down (from 7 to 8), depending on how long is it the normal scenario with 4 players. I guess that with 5 players the game will be too long.

Played with 4 players and grade went up to 8. With rules, 3 hours. Maybe a bit long, but no downtimes, you constantly feel the game progress. Don't think the grade can go up much more.

Played long scenario with 3 players. Almost 3 hours. Too long although not repetitive. The expansion about disasters is a complete -1 for me; the game is about thinking the best strategies and with this card you can be entirely out of the game just because of luck... I don't see it.... Solid 8 though.

I love both train games and dice allocation games, but I'm not quite in love with this one yet. It was frustrating to only be able to deliver one good at a time and then have to wait until your next turn to do anything. I'm used to tense Euro games that really tax your ability to do things by limiting your actions. Here I constantly found myself holding two or three dice that I couldn't use, giving up the rest of my turn out of a lack of things to do. It was kind of annoying.

I also hate the two-player board. Without the C routes, the map is useless: not only are several cities inaccessible, but even the optimal routes between cities are awkward and frustrating. I think we'll play with the whole board next time.

Have not played the base game, but got to play/playtest the newest expansion map (India) with Kevin Nunn and Gene at a recent San Jac meetup.  I played against two very experienced players, so I lost, but my score was very close as I took a different strategy from the experienced guys.  Now that I see how the game works, I think this one will see the table often once I get my kickstarter copy. The rules are easy to understand and I felt like I was actually playing after about 2 turns.
 
The switching stations and extra resource dice become an advantage later, so don't ignore them if they come out in the early game.

Rolling Frieght is a pretty cool little dice-driven game, where you build routes and deliver goods, utilizing dice rolls to carry out various actions.

Due to the dice rolling, your moves are often dictated by the results of your roll, but I really didn't mind this luck factor.  The more off-putting luck factor was that contracts come out semi-randomly, and it's extremely unlikely you'll be able to string together many great routes.  You can use other peoples' routes to make deliveries, of course, but the route-building part of the game didn't feel all that satisfying.  You mostly build whatever is available and matches your dice reasonably.  However, even though the game drives you a little bit, it was still a fun exercise.

I really wouldn't recommend the 5-player game at all.  There is a fair amount of down-time with 5, and not a good kind of down-time, since you can't really plan ahead due to the actions of other players changing things so much from turn to turn.  So, it's just sitting waiting for your turn to come back around.  It also adds a lot of game length, which drags on for too long.  So, I'd really classify Rolling Freight as a 2-4 player game, and wouldn't even consider it again with 5. 

However, with the right number of players, this is a pretty fun game if you don't mind a healthy dose of luck in your train games!

RATING: 5
There are a lot of positive things happening in the game and it is differentiated enough from the age of steam family to justify its existence. It's pick up and deliver, but acquiring contracts, building routes and delivering goods are all controlled by die rolls. It is more difficult to plan ahead because of this, so the game feels very tacticaL, which I don't mind. I like the way the board expands west as the game rolls on as well. A few issues. The game well overstays its welcome at 2.5-3 hours(playing with 5). Also, there are a lot of issues with the graphics. It is absurdly easy to misread colors, miss available shipping opportunities because the goods are large enough to mostly cover the receiving city's shipping status, and there are random skips along the score track that are annoying. So its a little frustrating, but there is some good gameplay hiding in there.

Route building and delivery game using dice. It's a fine game with solid mechanics. The game just runs too long for what it is. I would only want to play this with 3, and could possibly be talked into a 4 player game, but would never play 5. Another downside are the super tiny cards. They have got to be the smallest cards I have ever seen. Would play may be once or twice a year, and definitely something I would not seek out to play.

This game seemed decent enough, with an interesting idea that passengers pay more for shorter trips, while freight earns more money for long voyages to their destinations.  

The game was let down by the first version having dice that essentially started to rub off after the very first game.  I traded it away, with a warning to the new owner about that.  I find my "train game fix" with other games.

Well, unlike Tom Vasel statement, this isn't a replace for Railways of the World. Tom seems to be a dice nut so factor that into his reviews. I prefer all the cards in RotW, including the extra ones for the Mexico map. I do dislike that US map, the eastern upper part, have the Europe map which is good. 

This game doesn't have as many dices as I was thinking due to the reviews. The game supports 5 players and most of the dice count goes to that. I don't care for the auction in RotW, wish you could merge the two games. RotW has cool railroad piece parts, RF doesn't. RF runs a bit long for what it is. 

I think I like RF less. You can expand RotW to the excellent Europe map and that England Wales map which I believe can be played with two sets of rules, more mileage out of the base set.

Those promo disaster cards in RF look lame, I don't have them.

Review based upon playtest at BGGCon.

Fun little game- think of it as a more advanced Ticket to Ride, with pick up and deliver as the key mechanism for scoring points.  You roll the dice, lay the track with those dice (using them as 'money'), and then make what runs you can.  A nice progression of spaces opening up over time makes competition for runs very tight.

I'm a little unsure of the extent to which there is any real long term planning- most of the decisions seemed to be about how to best use what dice you rolled.  Which isn't bad- if they tighten the game up, I think that APE could turn Rolling Freight into a very nice low to mid weight rail game- perfect for people looking for something a little 'heavier' than Ticket to Ride, but aren't ready for Age of Steam just yet.

A good combination of construction and delivery, with both relying on the results found on a set of dice you roll every turn.  Has enough choices to make some difficult, and does reward efficiency.   Needs more maps, though - a lot more maps.

Alien Frontiers meets Railroad Tycoon. This train game feels much different than the others. I thought the random contracts would hinder your strategy but it only adds to the tension. In other train games people can block your track with theirs. The random contracts in this game have the same effect. Well thought out, a sense of development, and there is always lots to do.  I just want the Texas map now!

Rolling Freight is a route building and cargo shipping game in which dice represent each player’s resource pool. Players spend these dice to purchase and complete rail contracts, deliver cargo, and improve their companies’ competitive abilities. Who can build the best rail network and deliver the most profitable goods?

Played 2 player texas and Western US and 5 player South Eastern US. Both small and large games work well but be pre-pared for a long game if playing with max players on SE US. For some thats a problem but I see no issue with it. Also it was 1st plays on all maps so it will get a little faster ( I think 3-3.5 hrs) for 5 players is optimal).

Everyone I've played it with so far has liked the mechanics, The dice do not create too much of a reliance on luck and even with 5 players it is possible to make a loose plan and follow it.

This should appeal to more than just the train game enthusiasts as the main event at any gathering or a casual 2 player Texas game as a filler. 

Cant wait to see what the GB maps adds.

A dice driven network building and pick up and deliver game. It involves several tactical optimization, but it it almost impossible to pursue some long term strategy. 

Improvement cards look rather imbalanced.

Way too long for a dice rolling game (almost) without any way to control the dice results (about 3 hours for a 4players game).

Materials are subpar: cards too small, with tiny fonts. Information on the board is 
partially hidden by playing pieces.

Fun train game that is best described as RRT with dice. A bit too much luck involved perhaps, both with the dice rolls and with what contracts show up? I also think the red and yellow gods score too much. I'll gladly play again and try out different strategies. This time I was the only ones building extra stations, but you need a lot of them to actually make a difference.

Overstays it's welcome a bit. Would be nice if you could shorten playtime somewhat.

It was similar to Age of Steam type delivery games which I enjoy.   However, there wasn't a lot of opportunity to capitalize on longer routes.  it was all about filling contracts and building links for points.  Delivery was of minor importance.  Also, we all had qualms about the development of this game.  The board was crowded, colors were really hard to tell apart, the rail links didn't fit well, the cards were ultra small, and the print was so small I needed a magnifying glass to read.  And my friends game was missing pieces to boot.   This game might have been great 20 years ago, but now it is just a bad imitation.

Players are railway barons, obtaining contracts to construct railways, and shipping goods over those railways.  Mechanically simple game - roll a bunch of dice and spend them on buying contracts, placing cubes on the board to construct railway links, purchasing junctions (basically dice discounts), and improvement cards (bonus abilities).  Points are scored for completing contracts, delivering goods, as well as bonuses for goods delivered at three points during the game.  The game ends when nearly every contract has been purchased, most points wins.  

A mixed bag - some really good stuff, and a lot of stuff that's not so good.  The dice are a great mechanic - it worked brilliantly in War of the Ring, and it works well here too.  The contract game is pretty much Canal Mania, and the delivery game is Steam, so the pedigree for a good game is in place.  The bad stuff is the game is way too long - at least three hours.  I enjoyed the first 90 minutes, then the alarm bells began clanging.  There is also a distinct sense of the game playing you - you cannot plan where you build your links, you have to take whatever contracts are there at the time - so there is no strategic game, it's all about short term tactical dice usage.  It appears impossible to peg back a leader - one of the biggest sins in a 3 hour game is no comeback path.  Just sit there are watch that carrot jiggling away as you desperately try to catch it.  The game board is very busy too - quite difficult to spot the yellow/grey city colours without getting up close for a good look.  Some good stuff, but a developer needed to lop the playtime in half.

Age Of Steam "The Dice Game".   With a bit of TTR scoring for building links.   At 3.5 hours for a 4-player game, I felt like it was about twice as long as it needed to be.   I'm told the other map makes for a shorter game.   The concept is well implemented.   The cards are the smallest cards you've ever seen in game, but actually it didn't matter.   My biggest complaint, other than the length, is that the city demand color rings are just too small on the map and hard to see.   The blue and the grey are too similar as well.   So, there's some minor graphic design issues, but nothing that ruins the game.   I'm definitely not a huge fan of AoS, but I enjoyed this well enough and would play again if it wasn't going to go past 2 hours.

RF acts like a large train game, with route building, "company" improvements, and cargo delivery, while not feeling heavy. Using dice as universal resources works very well.

After one trial, this one got traded off for a copy of Kingdom Builders...and without regret, too.

Rolling Freight LOOKED wonderful, but the way track routes were divided into sequential phases felt awfully forced.  Basically, the track pieces within each phase got randomized, but you always knew which phase of the game included which chunks of track.

When I asked why this was so on the game's Geekpage forum, I was hoping there was some actual railroading history behind the way bits of track appeared in the general order in which they did.

Instead, I was told that the track pieces were forced into their various phases "to allow route-building strategies to grow."

In other words, you could completely randomize the order in which track-building contracts became available, but doing so would take all the strategy out of the game and turn it into a simple contest of tactics: figuring out which of the available options was your best bet while having no idea what track-building options might turn up in future turns.

Now throw in the memory contest--who can remember which contracts have been drawn and which ones you could still hope to see come out.

Bleah.  I hate games that rely heavily on memory, so randomizing the track-building contracts wasn't an option for me.  And leaving the game as written made it way too samey-samey.

The end result: not much of a game there.  It was far prettier than it was fun.

[b][FirstPlayOn22ndApril2014][/b] At last, I get to play this game. This game has been on my buylist ever since Vasel and Ryan spoke about it.

This is a simple train game, pretty standard actually where you are trying to deliver cargo as well as build tracks. What unique about this game is all are done using coloured dice. Think of Alien Frontiers, but instead of the standard pips, you get coloured sided dice (some have two colours on a side and some goes to four with upgraded dice). Every action, requires dice.

I like how different cargo type rewards you different points depending on how short or long the routes you use (Red and yellow emphasize on short routes while grey and blue are for long routes). Each city only accept one good, and when it does, it's closed. This forces you to open new city and forming new route to allow more cargo types and what it receives. Delivering cargo uses dice, and when you use other player's track, you need to use two dice. Delivering along longer routes will definitely cost you a lot of dice (you start with six dice), and sometimes it's impossible for you to deliver with just your starting dice. This is where you switching stations comes in. Switching stations give you discounts on the amount of dice you need to use. Each player have a switching stations track on their player board, and it cost you dice to upgrade the track. The higher you are on the track, the more discounts you get, but the price for your next upgrade on the track will also cost more.

For route building, you need to own a contract that shows which route you get to build. You can have at most three contract at a time. The point scoring is very standard, where longer routes bag more points, but the score will be slightly lowered if you have two or three contracts in your possession whenever you score a contract. In a way, being greedy, or aiming to fulfill many contracts at a time will reward you slightly lower points. 

The game is good, but it feels longer that it needs to be. Our three-player game (all were new), took us almost two-hours. Although you re-roll your dice when you're done with your turn (so that you can decide what to do on other players turn), when the turn comes to you, there's always a bit of AP involve. 

One complain that I have is the awful small cards. It's impossible to sleeve. 

I'd love to own this, but will not go all out to pre-order it at my FLGS. I will get it if my FLGS choose to bring this in on their own.

Overall, it was a fun experience and I'd like to try it again to tweak my strategy.  I'm not great at calculating optimization, though, so am worried that I may never win this one.  That being said, there may be enough interaction via the building of tracks, etc. to balance that out.

Good quality.  Spray dice w clear coat - ideally prior to first use.   Cardboard stockpile tokens seems like a bit of an afterthought --though they're functional.

Kind of a TTR where you roll for colors instead of collecting cards - but more fun than that.  Plays w 2 in about 90 mins.

I don't finde adding dice to generally make anything more "fun."  It's like a hand management game where you draw a new hand every time - play Dominion instead.

Very cool railroad laying + freight business game that's a lot less luck-based than it first appears. I like how you can modify your odds and the many different ways you can use the die. It's also a fresh take on the railroad genre, with mechanisms that might draw beginners who maybe think Steam is too daunting.

Railways of the World with dice. RotW is my favorite rail game. This appears to be played in smaller amount of time with smaller footprint. I like the dice mechanic. Wish the dice were better quality. I can see this getting more plays than RotW. Also would be a good gateway to RotW.

I didn't enjoy this game. It gave us analysis paralysis. The graphics weren't functional. I like railroad games, but this one doesn't measure up. I was disappointed in this one. Fiddly set up, fiddly game play. The game board is very busy too - quite difficult to spot the yellow/grey city colors without getting up close for a good look. It could be a very good game, but as it is now I'm reluctant to play it again.

An excellent dice-driven train game with interesting strategy. The dice are not so unfair as to hose your turns on a bad roll, and similarly the actions requiring dice are not so strict as to deny you actions on a bad roll. I'm eager to play this again.

RATING: 6
All in all, the game reminds me of Age of Steam, where you build up systems of train links and then deliver goods over them for points.  However, it's much less complicated than that, since there are no auctions, no shares/loans, and no income track.  To a certain extent, the number of dice you have is equal to the number of links that you can traverse, except that opponent's links cost 2 dice rather than 1.  

This is a game with lots of dice-rolling, which is something I generally dislike, but at least there are special ability cards which reduce a player's vulnerability to bad rolls.  I especially like the card which allows you to set 2 regular dice (presumably to 2-coloured sides) before rolling the rest.

I think the best strategy is to build long contiguous networks.  Like in Ticket To Ride, even without delivering on contracts (tickets), you can get lots of points just by building long links.  But you can get bonus points by using your network to deliver goods over long distances, so it's good to make a connected network of links if possible.  Of course, delivering a red or yellow good over a single link is worth a bunch of points, so it's worth building a link near those goods if it's possible to deliver them, although that's a competing goal to building connected long-haul networks for blue or grey goods.

One rule that is very important to remember is that you can only deliver one cube per turn, unlike Age of Steam which allows 2 cubes to be delivered in the "move goods" phase.

RATING: 7
Not bad, although I'd almost certainly rather be playing Age of Steam. The dice are an interesting wrinkle, and there are various mechanisms to lessen their impact. A highly tactical game. Presentation is kind of uneven... the board looks great but important information can be easy to overlook. And those tiny cards don't help.

Complexity is around the same level as Steam/Railways, but this game seems to require more time for analysis, which contributes to this game playing a bit longer than I would desire. Perhaps this will improve with more plays. I like the removal of demand from cities mechanism and getting points for building routes. The biggest issue I have with this game is difficulty in seeing what cities demand without abundant lighting. Removed 1/2 point until I have played enough to recommend.

2014-02-28 - This is a great route building/goods delivery game. The rules are simple and easy to learn and the game plays relatively quickly once you know it. It's deceptively simple, though, because initial turns can feel kind of random and uninteresting. It isn't until you start really thinking about deliveries (and bonuses for long deliveries) that things get really interesting.

2017-07-03 - I think this is a decent game, but we just never really wanted to play it again. I'm beginning to think that pick up and deliver is just not for me. Lowering my rating.

Ok game. The resource mechanisms work, but it is a little fiddly with all the tokens on the board. Would benefit from some sort of secret goal cards, so you have something to work on when you dont really know what to aim for in dry periods. Not a lot of downtime, but it felt a little long anyway, mostly because the pressure was a lot lower than other train games. Who would have thought I would miss debt this much!

I liked:
-"Improvements".  This allows for interesting and different strategies.
-The strategic balance between "fast" and "slow" goods.
-The historical angle worked into the design.
-The "non-functional" part of the graphic design, like the coffee rings, the pipe, etc.

Neutral on:
-Train games.  Dice games.  I don't hate such games, but I don't seek them out either.

Didn't like:
-Length.  More and more I realize 3-4 hour games are just not my ideal game length.  The point of diminishing returns for me starts around 2 hours.  Part of it is, I like to experiment with strategy in a game, and if my experiment is clearly a failure after 2 hours, I don't like having to watch the failure crash and burn for another 2 hours.
-The rules (or at least the way I was taught) say to roll the dice at the end of your turn and plan before your next.  But then invariably all my calculations were wasted when the contracts & resources I planned for were taken by the time it got back to me.  I started enjoying the game a lot more once I started planning only once it got back to me.  And rolling and sorting the dice takes about 5 seconds so you really could do that at the beginning of your turn and it makes things less frustrating.
-I've realized I don't enjoy "route finding games" (like Auf Achse and this).  
-The "resource demand" graphic design just felt fiddly and it was hard to see who wanted what, etc esp. as the board became crowded with saturated markers.  Then trying to remember which route you did and whose track you went over to give everyone credit just felt fiddly too.

I can see why some people would like this game, but there are some big problems I experienced.

1. Having to sort out the right cards for a certain player count by actually looking at every single one is ludicrous. There must be a better way.

2. #1 is made even worse by the unbelievably small size of the cards. The card size really makes the game much more difficult to play and seems like a terrible idea. Seeing that this game was kickstarted I guess that it was done to cut costs, but it's just dumb.

3. The game is simply too long for the amount of decisions and luck involved. If I could play this in 45 minutes I would probably rate it at least 3 points higher, but anywhere over an hour is excessive. Our first game took nearly two hours, which was excruciating.

Hopeful 6. Clever idea and the dice randomness isn't an issue as there are tools to mitigate it, but the lack of useful contracts and improvements on your turn can be too much of a screwage. The opening draft can have too big an impact on the game as well, which wouldn't be a problem if the game was 45-60 min shorter. If it goes much quicker with subsequent plays it could be a keeper, but it's not really for the serious train gamer.

A lot of good things: dice mechanism is great, the goods delivery with different kind of goods is great and I like the mechanism how the new links comes into play. The BIGGEST downside is the playing time... which is too long. The graphics could be better as well. So, this is not going to be keeper to me, because Age of Steam do these things better.

Played once, 4p.  Clearly influence heavily by Alan Moon and Martin Wallace, specifically by the Santa Fe family and the Age of Steam family.  Disappointed.  This game has several of my favorite mechanisms - route building and goods delivery.  However, your choice of new routes is limited on any given turn, your ability to build is determined by a roll of the dice, and good delivery is as exciting or as profitable as you'd like.  My biggest complain after the game was, there is no catch up mechanism.  The two players in front just charged to larger and larger leads, and the rest lagged further behind.  It seems like it would be easy to introduce some kind of advantage for being behind in points, but I'm not sure it would help.  Also, note that this is based on a single game.

RATING: 6
After five plays or so, the game continues to drag a bit longer than desired and one die seems overpowered. I like the game, but no longer feel the need to own. 

FIRST IMPRESSIONS:

First impressions were positive for me although the game felt a little bit long (of course, my game group tends to be more AP prone, so that was too be expected - our first game with 4 players took us 3 hours).  Dice weren't overly restrictive but did play a role at times in determining your actions.  I do think there is a fair bit of significant long term planning that can be done in this game despite the dice...:-)  Improvements can help modify dice results or give greater opportunity to roll what you need.  The shipping reminded me a bit of Age of Steam where you want to make long deliveries but in this case you can't go through a city more than once.  There were times in the game where people took time to count the links and different options to figure out the best options for deliveries of goods.  With a couple maps and the Kickstarter special, there should be a fair bit of replayability out of the box.  Rules were simple and well laid out in the rule book.  Be sure to build links where they will be used.  If you build out in the middle of nowhere by yourself, you will likely fail as you need others and their track to make longer and more valuable deliveries.  

This game does not allow you to build links where-ever you wish.  It is similar to Canal Mania in some ways in that there are preset routes which you purchase with your dice, however, delivery of cargo is free form along any track and is not based on a contract card.

Solid network building game of fairly modest complexity.  Te dice allocation system allows for a good mix of randomness and control.  There appear to be multiple legitimate routes to victory.

A train, pick up and deliver game but with a dice rolling mechanic.  You roll dice and use them to get orders, place track, or get special abilities to modify the dice.  It has some similarities to other pickup and deliver games but it is different enough that it is a fresh take on this type of game.  I like the game but have seen a few games where the leader was very much in command and there was little a trailing player could do to catch up.  I would need to play a couple more times to see if this is a regular problem.

Not a bad economic, railroad game but I felt it overstayed its welcome after the first hour.  It has some interesting mechanics like the dice as your resources and rolling them at the end of your turn to plan for future actions.  A lot of games should use this model.  I like how the first half we're building the "map" and then the latter half is rushing to deliver cargo the most efficiently.  It's interesting.  Perhaps another play may help but it left me w/ just an ok feeling about it.

We liked a lot of things about this game. It was a very fun concept (almost like a Ticket to Ride: The Dice Game), and we LOVED the way the dice were implemented and how we each got unique improvements. Unfortunately, the items we considered flaws in the game ended up outweighing what we liked about it. First, it was simply too long for what it was, taking 2-3 hours to play a two-player game. Second, the graphic design was horrible in that it was hard to tell what color of good(s) each city wanted. Third, we didn't like how the routes came out in stages and how each city only wanted one good maximum over the course of the game.

Like the game, and I love many of the different options inside the game.  It takes a lot of good things from a bunch of different designs and blends them all. 

It is just a bit too long (our first game was 3.5 hrs with rules expl).  It became quite repetitive especially with certain analytical / indecisive players.  Willing to play a few more times to see if the play length gets noticeably quicker.

Also, we found the location circles (which determine the colours the city wants and the improvement cards to be way too small to read easily.  

We also found the contract names to be confusing - there could be a 4A contact in blue and red and yellow out at the same time... not a big deal really but somewhat confusing.  I would have much rather liked to see a denotation of the length of the route on the contract cards themselves and unique naming conventions.

The bonus disaster cards (supposedly for kickstarter supporters) were kind of a major disappointment (three tiny similar generic destruction cards)...  A lot more thought should have went into those imo.

All this being said I love the extra maps and can't wait to play the other boards to see how the flow changes.

- timing of appearance of contracts can really swing fortunes
- The fact that the game ends with every player getting one additional turn, including the person drawing the end of round can short 1 or more players of a turn.  This was the diff in our game.

I really like the way the dice work in this game, but the fact that the timing of the routes can really help or hurt a player (luck) and the game end procedure really knock this down a rating for me.

I suppose this is my first "real" train game as far as pick up and deliver games go. I've only been able to fit in a couple of plays, but I'm ready for more. This game has given me a lot to think about. How to balance my desire to set myself up with good improvements with establishing a sound network of rails that will help mitigate the randomness of the dice. Oh yeah...you get to roll dice! As an old school RPG'er I really love to roll handfuls of dice and yet my interest in non-random strategy games usually doesn't allow for such things. So, despite the fact that the randomness of the dice can really be a thorn in your side, I love that I can play a good game with tough decisions that allows for some dice-chucking. I am really starting to love the train games and this one is perfect for my (and my group's) experience level.

I thought about Kickstarting the game back then. I didn't, mostly because of the length of the game. Now I got a chance to play and I can tell I made the correct decision.

There's good stuff in it. The dice are good. The two different types of cargo is good. Lots of possibilities... Interesting stuff, really.

Downsides? Too long play time (2.5 hours in our game with five players). The board is ugly and busy and the cargo good symbols are hard to read.

I'd play again, but don't have any particular rush to do so.

The dice theme is a bit of a letdown in this one. Mechanically, it plays similar to Steam/Railroad Tycoon, but with dice instead of money. The dice themselves, though, are spent mostly generically, aside from two actions (of 5) that a player may take on their turn, meaning the dice are only limiting to those two actions. They are important actions, but with split colored die faces, it feels like really bad luck if you can't do what you want to do on your turn, rather than poor planning. Approach it as a train game with dice; not a dice game with trains.

Though based on dice as resources, Rolling Freight presents a large number of important decisions that allows a player to maximize the returns without being held captive by dice.  RF is a lot heavier than TTR but does not feature a Stock Market like portions of the 18XX community.  I would classify it as a medium heavy (7 of 10 on a heaviness scale) game. People who look past the dice see the strategies that they can develop.

A pick up and deliver, route building game, that make it nearly impossible to really choose your strategy. You are limited to what routes you can build by randomness, so it's possible for a great route to come out when you have no chance to build it. This game is mainly about optimizing each individual turn, since your actions are determined by the random die rolls. I'm not really that impressed by this game and if I want to play a route building, pick up and deliver game, I'll play Age of Steam or Canal Mania.

[i]I played a 2p game with Mat teaching and had a blast. I love pick up and deliver games and this also added in rolling dice. Even with the dice this game never felt random, I always had options on my turn, maybe not always what I wanted but that's okay. The upgrade cards you get will definitely keep the game fresh because they can definitely alter how you will play the game. I also enjoyed optimizing my delivery routes in order to score bonuses on goods that either wanted a fast delivery [i](minimum number of connections between cities)[/i] or a slow delivery. I thought the game worked really well with two and I am looking forward to playing again.[/i]

Elegant and smooth-playing railway dice roller. I love the puzzly feel of this, something found in many euros, but here it seems less abstract. To me it's plausible that the results of your dice roll represent industry contacts, business opportunities, or day-to-day chance events that help or hinder. The exclusive technologies you buy help to create the feeling that your railway company is different to other players', with its own strengths and weaknesses.
For me this is a true train game, much better than, say, Ticket to Ride, as in Alan Moon's effort the railway subject matter is only really present as a graphical sheen on an abstract network-building game.
Despite an endorsement from Tom Vasel, Rolling Freight never seems to have sold well, which is a shame. An online implementation would be really welcome, and might help to give the game a new lease of life.

Rolling Freight takes the pick-up-and-deliver mechanism from Age of Steam and puts it into a train game with no economics, pre-printed routes that can be built, and an action system where your actions are determined by dice you roll. On the surface, this would seem to be a less involved experience, but while it's definitely easier, I wouldn't say it's shorter. Routes are available to be built in a random order, which makes it harder for players to build a giant network in one area, and encourages players to use each other's tracks. I didn't really care for the action dice system, as it felt like I was always wasting efficiency when my dice didn't work out. There were also special-power technologies that could be purchased, which were pretty good at differentiating people's strategies. The board was laid out so as to prevent easy deliveries of the goods that give bonuses for short runs, and also prevent long deliveries of goods that give bonuses for long runs. I was a little frustrated by that, but I guess learning the map better would yield insight as to where the workable parts of the map are. My bigger concerns were with graphic design--the cities were ringed with their demand color, which theoretically could be seen with the available good sitting in the middle. Practically though, with some cities having multiple demand rings right next to them, lots of stuff placed on the board, and two of the colors being very similar, I found it very difficult to read the board. The game also had some of the smallest cards that I've ever seen, which added to the fiddliness. On the whole, I like a lot of these game mechanics, but found the game to be a bit frustrating and long.

Sort of classic tran game like Railroad Tycoon, but with implementation of dice. As you only need 1 specific color for purchasing a contract, there is almost no 'faulure-because-of-bad-luck' - in this game, nice implementation of dice.

What turns me a bit of is the - imho - ugly artwork that doens't seems to be that functional is you still have te search where you can deliver those good cubes.

After one play: a pleasant game, but I can't help comparing it with Railways of the World, (Age of) Steam, and similar games where you have more control and you can get the experience of building a cohesive railroad network. The dice and the shuffled deck of contracts in Rolling Freight mean that you have little control over where you build. But I do like the mechanisms that slowly enable longer deliveries as the game progresses. I would play it again.

very interesting take on the pick up and deliver train game.  I like the "randomness" of the dice.  The extra dice are very powerful, yet expensive.  If you can get a bonus die at the onset of the game for free -- get one.  

I think the board could have been a touch bigger to help show city colors, but it's a very good game.

I love the dice, and enjoyed figuring out the optimal puzzle on your turn, but sadly it means that the game mostly comes down to ideal route searching, and min maxing.  The downtime is tough, I can't even imagine playing this four players let alone five.  Just think of the time spent alone looking for routes to flag.

I think the big weakness in the game is that the contracts come out randomly.  Once you've committed to a course you know what contracts that you want and the player that doesn't have to wait because of the luck of the flip has a serious advantage.  Most of the game is just finding the best way to take tactical advantage of your turn, with a couple goals that you make for yourself. Repeat. The dice can bone you here and there which is fine, but nothing like the contracts.  I couldn't stand it in Canal Mania, and I think it is equally groanworthy here.

All of the uneven friction doesn't add fun rather it just adds length as people have to play damage control; to see whether they want to bother risking investing in new routes that they didn't want in the first place just to keep the cards cycling to get to the ones that they need.  

I really loved the super powers, but once you got yours at the beginning there is little motivation to change, unless it is upon your realization that the withhold a tile power is super weak compared to the rest of them.  The cards just sat there most of the game.

Sad, I really wanted to like it, but it felt like other games did the same kind of stuff better, and for the length I would rather be playing a lighter 18xx.

I have been looking for quite a while for a train game that I really like, and I have found it with Rolling Freight.  Great job, Kevin Nunn!  I find most trains game dull and static, but the inclusion of dice (without adding too much luck) brings life and fun to this game.  I also dislike how other trains games reward you for finding long, inefficient routes to ship good. Rolling Freight's mechanic of two types of goods that score bonuses for short and long routes fixes this problem.

1 play, 5er

This is a cube-delivering train game, like Age of Steam (or maybe more like Canal Mania) but with dice. There's more randomness than AoS: 
- routes available to be built come up randomly
- there are special power cards (e.g., extra dice; cheaper builds; bonuses during cube moves; etc.), also coming in random order
- you roll dice at the end of your turns; nice idea, but the board can change a lot while you wait so planning isn't as helpful as you'd think. The dice can be used to buy those power cards, or incrementally build matching-colored routes

Fun, but I'm not sure if the level of randomness will be too much for me? And I tend to dislike random route building (like in the Lancashire Rail games). Also that first game was a bit too long (of course, near the end, I finally hit upon a technique to speed the game up a bit: when delivering cubes, place player markers on each track used -- makes it MUCH easier to remember who is earning what!). Still, it's a pretty neat system that I'd like to try again, maybe with just 4 players.

----
Update after 2nd play (3er): the game is still WAY too long, and I don't like some of the production choices:
- the cards are TOO DAMN SMALL!
- some colors (blue/gray) are a bit hard to distinguish in our lighting
- those little demand circles are REALLY little; would've been nicer if you could actually see them more easily
- setup, where you have to take out a bunch of cards from the deck, is a pain (especially with those little cards)
- is there some pattern in the way routes are numbered (other than by phase of game)? It was annoying having to search for them every turn!

I am unsure on whether this is any good or not.  I don’t like how you need to wait for contract to build a certain route.  It causes a completely strange and chaotic build pattern with seemingly no way to really mitigate your track being pretty much anywhere.  I like the dice part of it; but the rest of the game seemed an afterthought.

Perhaps the best pick up and deliver game I've played so far, over Steam, etc. The mechanisms interact very cleverly, and it remains interesting the whole way through. The reset between rounds isn't as fiddly as I've seen in other games, and the way to designate connections makes the board very visually interesting as the game progresses.

A lot simpler than it first seems. The dice work fine - nothing new in how they are used, but nothing wrong. What does work well is each city only taking 1 good, which then can be manipulated to allow for longer runs. Lots of chances to mess with your opponents plans. Solid train game which sits at the same depth as Railroad Tycoon.

RATING: 5.3
Slightly mediocre. 

I'm not willing to hold the game up for 10 minutes each turn while I calculate the most points I can score from each of the 26 barrels on the board, and then take in to account points that would score for each other player and rank the options based on their relative merits. I'm also not willing to sit and wait 30 minutes between turns while each other player does that. Thankfully that didn't happen, but it felt a lot like we were all playing sub-optimally. I like the improvements, and almost like the way route cards come in to the game, but the graphic design is a mess and players spend too long calculating a route only to realise that it is illegal as it passes over a destination for the barrel they're shipping... Add in dice (one player essentially broke our game by being able to store something like 14 actions on a turn using 2 improvements which allowed him to store / results on dice) and woefully inefficient shipping routes and this really isn't for me
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Nice game.  Very fiddly setup and play (making the contract deck, B/C and exhaustion markers, &c.) and play suffers from design decisions (blue vs. grey in low-light, route-naming, scoring track smaller than bits and blocked by art, &c.) but the 1st two phases pass smoothly enough.  C phase drags; most sites exhausted/over-supplied, players take too long to calculate longest routes, &c.  Switching stations, the development deck, and the rolling mechanic in general are fun and work very well.

Classic train game = build tracks, ship goods. The main difference to other games in the genre is that it is dice driven.

It is a nice attempt in introducing something new into and old genre. Unfortunally it falls flat - dice rolling just isn't a good mechanic in more serious games.

You will get a much more ejoyable experience by playing Steam, Railroads of the world, 18XX or something similar.

That said, I applaude the designer for trying to create an interesting hybrid.

I might play it again with three players, because then it is a pretty quick game. Any more than that and the downtime will kill it.

Rolling Freight is another game that has been on my "Want to Play" list for several years.  I've recently played and enjoyed [thing=17133][/thing] and [thing=28720]Brass[/thing], so I think medium-weight rail games might be up my alley.

Rolling Freight felt a lot like Railways of the World, but I think I like this one better.  And it might just be because I didn't really like the event deck in Railways of the World.  RF uses one of my favorite game mechanics, which is rolling dice at the start of your turn and using those dice to take your actions.  I also enjoyed the upgrade cards that allow you to explore alternate paths to victory.  

Other than that, it was fairly similar to Railways of the World in the route-building and good-shipping.  One unique aspect is that you could only build the routes that became available, so you often have to wait a while until you can complete a route you are hoping for.  I do like the fact that you can be working on 3 routes at once, but you get more points if you only do one at a time.

Overall, I enjoyed my play.  We almost played with 5, but thankfully we decided to play with 3 instead.  I would not want to play with more than 3 because the downtime is linear but your actions are fixed.  This might be my favorite train game, but I haven't played any of them more than once, so take that with a grain of salt.  I think I really like train games.  Does this mean I should be trying an 18XX?

This could be a six, possibly a seven game for me, if not for the length of time it takes to play.  A beginner's game took three hours, and the pace that the game takes is glacial.  I don't just mean that there's not a lot you can do when it's not your turn than wait for someone else to finish theirs, but the game also has a slow accumulation rate.  The design is pretty solid -- the game gives you enough options for manipulating the dice so that you're not just stuck with whatever you roll -- but there's still an element of randomness that can just hose you, and it just takes too long to play.  If this could be honed down to an hour of playtime it would be perfect; as it is, there are other, better rail games to play in that time frame.

Excellent use of dice in a rail game and a break from all the 18xx ones that keep getting churned out. Different enough to make it worth having and playing for variety. Will appeal to the casual rail game fan but probably not the hardcore 18xx fan. Medium weight game play.

The game has a lot of nice things going for it.  But, it takes too long for what it is and isn't really anything other than a mishmosh of other games (Steam, Ticket to Ride, dice placement.  All in all, I'd play it again, but I don't think I really need to own it.

My 5 rating might seem a bit hard. The game certainly has good ideas but it plays way too long and there is little control. There are better train games out there that give a more satisfying experience in less time. The game also suffers from production issues, colors on the destination cities are hard to see and in general it is difficult to see the needed information on the board. It could be a very good game, but as it is now I'm reluctant to play it again.

A minor problem with Rolling Freight is that it isn't very good and doesn't need to exist.  It's a rough game that reminds me of Volldampf, an early Martin Wallace design that history left behind.

Dude, there's a reason why Volldampf evolved into the successful Steam series rather than simply being reprinted.  Because Steam and its close relatives are much better games.

I could list everything wrong with Rolling Freight, including the endgame conditions, grinding length, lack of proper scaling with different numbers of players, and rich-get-richer issues. But it doesn't matter, because the game doesn't need to be fixed.  It needs to be erased.

Also, Kickstarter sucks.

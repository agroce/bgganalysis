RATING: 5
Fine party game that will only hit the table if everyone involved likes Anime. Low rating because the game is almost too niche to reliably play despite how creative it can get.

Played with a group of friends many times at a board-games library, but can't source a copy as yet. Great if you have imaginative friends who also understand anime tropes. Gameplay is very simple and the strength of the game largely hinges on how creative you and your friends are.

It doesn't get much better than this; immensely fun party game with a lot more substance than other party games. I love having the creative juices stimulated, and this hits the spot every time!

Also works with non-anime crowds.

Definitely geared towards hard core anime fans that are aware of all the nuances of the media

Fun party game with the right group.  Best with fans of anime but works with anyone who watches TV and has some creativity.

So, I needed a party game, it was one of those genres that I just didn't own.  I have several friends who own Cards Against Humanity and I wanted to get something different.  I saw Channel A at my local game store and picked it up because I liked the theme and the storytelling aspect of the game.  I'm actually really glad that I did!  I have had some great games of Channel A, all of which have, at some point or another, caused me to laugh so hard that I feel like I might have a herniated a disc.

If you play with the right people this game is wonderful.  I recommend playing only with people who have at least a little bit of an imagination, unless you like being bored.

This is an excellent creative game. I feel that people will often be put off by its Anime theme if they are not familiar with the genre. But give it a try sometime, and if you come across some premise you're not familiar with, just grab another and keep going.

Great game, though I have two bits of advice for prospective players:

Firstly, get a group who can think on their feet.  I have people with whom I often game and a few of them can't think fast or creatively enough to play this game, so they usually sit out.  You have to be able to come up with a [somewhat] original story every single turn, and that's not something that everyone can do.

Secondly, we like to play "Apples to Apples" style, by which I mean whomever is the producer each turn will sit out the turn and not make a title. They are then the judge of the other players. The two Premise cards can still be handed out individually in case of ties.

RATING: 8
Amazing game, especially the graphics that go with certain words. Certain cards like the prefixes will be completely lost on non-anime fans though. 

The only major issue is that you need to play with anime fans for maximum enjoyment. A minor issue is that the cards are really thick, making it kind of hard to shuffle.

Kind of an Anime Apple to Apples.  Other people liked it better than I.

RATING: 8
It certainly needs the right kind of group to play it with (or at least an idea of anime stereotypes and a few beers apiece), but it can be hilarious and a great creative endeavor.  Just be careful playing it with die-hard anime aficionados or set a time limit per turn, because it will take FOREVER when they really get going.

I love hearing all the creative stories that people can pull out of thin air as they try to pitch outlandish anime ideas. I just wish I was more comfortable participating in it myself.

I don't know of a funnier game where I can work on pitching and storytelling while laughing with my friends. If you have any interesting in pitching, storytelling, or anime it is 100% wroth getting.

I have no interest in Anime.

Cute fun game, easy to bust out in a large group. Definitely good for a laugh. Simple rules that everyone gets quickly. All in all a great party game.

Played a released copy of this at AnimeFest. The game itself is a lot of fun with anime nerds, storytellers and RPers. The cards are made of very heavy weight cardboard and the graphics accompanying the words on the title cards are excellent. I do think that the number of title cards are a little limited (coming from playing Cards Against Humanity with all the expansions it takes a while to get to repeats) and with a large enough group the suggestions may start to get stale. With an expansion for more choices this could be an excellent game.

Comment based on 2 hands of a pre-Kickstarter version: 

2 rounds of a pre-Kickstarter party game with Michael teaching Walter, me, Likka, and I-forget-her-name.

It's cute, a cross between The Big Idea (which Michael had never heard of) and other story-telling games. 

Each round 2 parts of an Anime premise come up, you have a hand of 10 nouns and adjectives. Form a title from up to 4 of them and try to pitch a show to the network execs. 

Voting is simple -- on a count of 3, everyone points to the other player whose premise they liked best. (Yes, at the wrong table people would vote for a bad pitch bound to lose to increase their own chances of winning. At our table everyone seemed to simply vote for the one they thought was best.) 

Not at all my kind of game but I did put a fair bit of thought and enthusiasm into my pitches, even stressing the merchandising opportunities available to savvy marketers. :-) 

It had a terrible pitch but I couldn't resist voting for Likka's "Double Sweet Kitty Cake".

better theme than apples to apples, but pretty much the same game mechanically.  Great for the right crowd.  Nothing special if you don't care about the theme.

The pitch can be *anything* because you're roleplaying studio executives. During my pitches, I didn't just tell the story, I talked about the merchandising, target demographics, franchise opportunities, potential overseas markets, recycling other animation series to save budget, inside jokes referencing other anime business decisions, and other "studio executive" discussion that was about anything *but* the story. 

You can also throw down the title cards like "Once Upon a Time" to help come up with a pitch and a title name. Or ignore the rules and throw down a title like "Pretty Dynamite Rune Quest with Fraulein Magica and Boyfriend Kaiser" and start there to run with it.

If you have Dixit components (or dice), you may want to use them to do the voting, rather than counting out loud.

Not even an anime fan and I enjoy this game. It's so much fun coming up with crazy ideas for shows. I do burn out on it quickly though since I cannot keep coming up with creative things after a few rounds.

I need this game. And I want to combine this with an anime-based tabletop roleplaying game, set in the world of the winning title!

RATING: 7
Pretty fun. Wish they'd made this a "general media" thing instead, as in not specific to anime. Basically whenever I bring this out I'm reminded that most people have no clue that there are anime series outside of the limited pool of garbagey crap that they were exposed to in the late '90s and early '00s that they think are classics. I also get to hear every stereotype about "wacky and crazy Japan" incorporated into their stories.

Played this at a friends place.  Awesome group/drinking game/alternative to cards against humanity.  I have role playing and creative friends that really enjoy this game.

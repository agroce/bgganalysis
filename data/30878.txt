I have tried to play this twice so far and my wife takes one look at the box and components and immediately loses heart. 
It does look like an extraordinarily dry Euro, but I am still trying to learn it and see if there is a decent game buried amidst all of that European ugliness.

This has lot of interesting stuff going on. Like Kogge, which I played a couple days ago, you can tell this comes from the same mind that came up with Hansa Teutonica. It fits a very particular niche (2-player, area control), but it does it very well. Looking forward to playign this one with a regular opponent (Mitch? Tom?)

Rating based on one play.  Really expected to love this game, but fell flat.  It seemed that once the scales started tipping A) the losing player didn't have a lot of options and B) the game ended very quickly.  Could definitely be talked into playing it again (particularly against an experienced player) but don't feel the need to sprint out and track down a copy for myself.

IT took me a while to work up the nerve to start playing this game. It's quite a little brain burner for two thanks to its alternating cycles which see different playing pieces become active, thus giving the players the tool they need to break apart the opponent's position.

The first game was an agreeable fight with a few minor rules errors. However, the second game ended in an annoying stalemate: our power bases were so strong that we couldn't dislodge each other from them. The game was pointless time burning until we decided to proclaim the winner a few rounds short of the official 12 VP-criterion. Mulling it over it [i]may[/i] have been possible to use an action tile to attack each other via coastal regions (which is a third way in which areas can become adjacent) but by that time the board was bristling with influence markers so it was hard to say.

I hadn't expected the game to turn into a trench war like it did, and I'm going to have to attempt it anew to see whether this is a regular occurrence or just bad luck. If it is the former, then my appreciation for it will take a nosedive; if it is the latter, then it will be a solid little thing for 2 players. Rate is certainly not fixed, but is a little higher than I think is prudent to reward the cheek of creating this kinda thing.

[b]Update[/b] My partner and I decided to leave further experimentation to someone else. Sold off, dropped the rate to its final, ambiguous level.

We stopped halfway through as it was just too long for what was happening. The sand timer was an interesting idea, and the switching neighbours rule was OK, but there were a few gaps in the rules and after being knocked back early, there was no way for me to recover. Bit of a brain-burner but it seems impossible to recover from a weak position.

A bit of a brain-burner but a very satisfying one.  Tough to see the game until it reveals itself; then you find a deep strategic struggle which hinges on key decisions.  Dominance in a cycle usually swings into the reverse during the next one.  Excellent game.

Only one play.  I have lots of rules questions to look up on the Geek after the first play, which doesn't say too much for the rules...  I like the look and idea of the game but it seemed like a real AP trap.  For my tastes it needs more hidden information or a bit of more luck to lighten the look ahead.  In general, it was confusing and a lot of work for a little game.  Still, I am going to play it a few more times.

RATING: 7
Be forewarned: It will take three plays of this before the cloud of confusion that surrounds this game starts to clear. Be also forewarned that this can be a brain-aching AP monster for some. The random assortment of action tiles each round can seem to swing the game, and that can't be planned for. Hand in hand with that are out-of-the-blue turnarounds that can leave you dizzy in the aftermath. Nevertheless, this game is a hard, deep, battle of wits that really impresses.

Some genres simply don't seem to work well with two (e.g., negotiation, auction, trick-taking) but there are always  exception to the rule. Area majority is one of those genres, and  Power and Weakness is one of those exceptions. 

The biggest things that distinguish this game as a two player affair is some great tempo management, wild swings, delicious tactics vs. strategy choices, and enough randomness to not make the whole game a calculable affair (which is an important feature of *all* area majority in my opinion -- and a necessity with two). I'd have to say that, for me, if I had to pick a "definitive" two-player area majority game, this would be it.

Note: the game would probably benefit from "dominance" markers to make the board easier to parse. Easily arranged though!

My German isn't very good, but I think I just got Ohnmachted.  There is some very interesting novelty here, but I think we broke the game.  We were able to separate into two halves of the board and two colors, and then this game of Angles versus Celts more closely resembled the Somme.  Movement was measured in inches.  Furthermore, in a reasonably close game (like ours), we were looking down the barrel at nearly 20 turns, not 12.  So it was long.  Others have commented on theme so thin as to be translucent, but even as an exercise in abstraction, it didn't work for me.  Too long, subject to analsysis paralysis, and the novelty just was not enough to compensate.

RATING: 8.5
This one is a brain burner for sure.  Lots of things you CAN do, but never enough time to do it all.  There are lots of ways to set up a killer move, but trying to do so while your opponent is messing with you is what makes the game very challenging - and fun!  Great game if you have 60-90 minutes to kill and 2 like-minded people playing.  Repeated plays will reveal the strategies and have also made me want to play it more and more.

RATING: 6
Tactical 2 player game with some very nice mechanisms mixing abstract wargame elements with Euro tile selection and auctions. However, based on single play if one player can get ahead with a good board position it can be a struggle for the other.

Played too long for what it is, as once the board is full the turns feel the same (no further development, just back and forth from that point). While I'd be happy to play to six points again, I'd be unwilling to play to the recommended 12.

Seemed to be some slight fuzziness around the combat rules, especially retreating (which is quite important).

There are some interesting things going on in this two-player majority game. There are two types of units, wizards and warriors, and each are active in alternating phases. When warriors are active adjacency is determined by physical borders, while for wizards adjacency is determined by matching tokens placed randomly at the beginning of the game. Adjacency is important since ownership of an area primarily changes hands by an attack from "adjacent" territories. While all of this is interesting and plays well, the most valuable actions come from tiles that are auctioned. You pay for the auction with your reserve of pieces, reducing the number of pieces you have to place. In practice, this means that the player who successfully waits out the other in playing their pieces can pick up a lot of great action tiles on the cheap. This does not feel like it should be the focus of the game as it has a ripple effect, clogging up other actions that might be taken in order to protect the cost of action tiles. It's a shame, because there are some really great ideas here.

Appears to me to be the best area majority game for two players in the business.  Interesting twist in that there are two distinct phases and units with each only being active and counting towards the score during their respective phase (magic and knight phases).  Another interesting twist is that during the magic phase, neighboring countries are ones with a similar symbol which can be all the way across the map.  It can be very difficult to attack and takeover, however, as you must have more active troops than the defender has active and passive troops in the contested country and its neighboring countries!  Different tiles are also available which break the rules and allow exceptions and takeovers.  There is a lot going on in this little game!

Clever area control game placed in an Arthurian England approx. 400 AD where neighbouring areas can be invaded and attacks and resistance supported from other neighbouring territories. The twist lies in that on alternating turns one of the two types of units--Knights and Wizards--becomes active and the other passive, and each of these types define "neighbouring" in different ways, a mind-twisting fact that means that the the game must always be played in two ways at the same time. 

For two players (with three players as an easily home-ruled alternative) with session times of about 60 to 90 brain-burning minutes. High player interaction, and relatively long down times, especially in a three-player game.

In my opinion the most underrated game on BGG. At the moment I am writing this, the avg. users rating is only 6.58. There are very few games recorded too, how can people miss that this game needs more plays to show its greatness?

This is a small masterpiece for exactly two players. The game is very short, 45 minutes, often less. There is a lot of tension, the entire game, because it can be won suddenly and unexpectedly with clever attack moves. There are two layers of area control, with alternating cycles: if one player wins one cycle, the other usually wins the other, and this going up and down, really power alternating with weakness, is its most characteristic aspect.  

Rules are incredibly clever, perfectly balanced, every game is always in equilibrium, each player attacks and then is attacked... but it is not a meaningless bouncing back and forth, because to win one has to find a way to prevail, using strategy and tactic: incredible how strategic it is, given the length.

It is a gamer's game, because strategies are not obvious, which I think is the main reason it hasn't had much success: people usually go to a new game if beauty is not revealed in the first two / three games.

It is by Andreas Steding, the same author of the more famous Hansa Teutonica, but IMHO it is a far more exciting and interesting game to play than HT. 

It offers an incredibly huge decision space for such a small package. Very low luck. Great replayability. More unique than original. A gem in a small box. 

Recommended.

Gives a first impression quite similar to King of Siam: A shortish, very abstract two-player game, which comes in a small box and looks very austere. This is also equally hard to figure out at first, but unlike King of Siam, gets clearer pretty fast after the first few rounds. Quite AP prone though, since there is quite a lot of stuff to keep track of, and the decisions arising are rather tricky. Manages to progress at a swift pace regardless.

Played once (plus one time where we had to stop about midway due to time constraints). Very interesting game with way more going on than the box size might make one think.  Many options and many different things to keep in mind while playing.  My only concern at this point is that it might be too easy for one player to concentrate on Magician phases and the other on Knight phases - leading to a punch-counterpunch play sequence until one player has enough for the win. I don't expect a game from Andreas Steding to be that transparent, though, so most likely further play will change my mind.

Unusual two-player confrontational area-control euro; a little hard to grasp on first play. I suspect some complaints about this game being overlong stem from a mis-reading of the endgame rules; nevertheless the box's 45 mins playing time would seem to be quite optimistic for first-timers. The game works well however and can be quite strategic, with luck playing a limited role. The rule book's not always clear and a few discrepancies were confusing at first. On the whole, I'd say this one is underrated.

Intriguing game with a bit less theme than I'd hoped. Love the trappings though. German title preferred.

In our game one side fairly quickly took control of the magic side, the other the knight side and it was a trade-off from there on out, leading to a narrow victory for the one that got ahead somewhere in the beginning. We weren't sure, perhaps, how to explore, breaking this stalemate.   

I'd change some things--play with a timer (speeding up the game and making it less brain-burning), limit the # of available action tiles to be selected by the sand timer #, and allow less action tiles one can play in a round rather than allowing using a bunch up to end the turn.

Very cute Euroized wargame.  There is a lot of push and pull here, that can build up to entertaining results and engaging decisions.  It is tough to wrap your head around all the different manipulations of the rules.  Clearly this has been well playtested as there are little rules for everything, but at the same time it feels a bit clunky.   I think that because of the size of the box and the bald face lie known as the printed playing time I expected something lighter, so I was a bit surprised when sitting down to this.  If you can grock the strangely confusing rules, you will find a nice little abstract conflict system.

This was one of my very rare impulse purchases - I saw it on a game store shelf, I was impressed with the medieval artwork on the box cover, I noticed that it was a small, 2-player, area control game, and I decided to pick it up.  However when I read the rules I noticed that the medieval "knights and magicians" theme was just as pasted on as Reiner Knizia's "Samurai", and when I played it I noticed that the game wasn't fun.  The artwork is hit and miss, but mostly miss.  The tiles look great, but the fuzzed-out board is boring, and what's with the orange and white colour choices?!?  The game itself is fairly solid.  I mean come on, it has elements that include drawing tiles, playing tiles, bidding on tiles, and even canceling out tiles!  But I'm just not drawn into this game.  If the cubes were actually plastic knights and the discs were actually plastic magicians that might have helped a bit, but I'd probably still be fairly bored by it.  Give me "Mr. Jack" or "Dungeon Twister" any day!  Too bad - so much for impulse purchases!  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 1.5/5  Total: 5/5

I enjoy Power and Weakness, because it's fascinating how the pieces in the two different cycles interact and affect one another.  At the same time, the game feels like two separate duels, and players cannot completely ignore either one of them.  The game is more complicated that I'm normally looking for when playing a two player game, and it's often difficult to tell who's winning until the end.  All that being said, it is still a satisfying experience to see one's plans succeed.

Much more than I was expecting based on the fairly simple rules presentation. There's a heckuva' lot  going on here -- the subtlety of the two unit phases, the adjacency rules of the two unit types, the countdown timing of both individual turns and the endgame conditions. All these things contribute to a pretty deep thinking game using very simple constructs (area control, majority).

After 1 Play: I think 2-player area control games are really hard to do well.  I was really excited about trying this one, but the game didn't seem to flow well.  I was similarly disappointed with Aton.  Kahuna is the best game of this type that I've found so far, but even that one isn't great.

An engine building game with an ancient civilisation theme.  It plays quite quickly and there are some interesting combinations of inventions to explore.  The gods and disasters provide some variation and a touch of interaction. There appear to be strategic options.

Engine building is not really my kind of game, yet I've quite enjoyed a couple of plays of Uruk.

The kind of game that needs several plays to feel comfortable with.  Icons are not so intuitive, and it feels as if you could play some rules wrong several times.  The game has some nice mechanics, reminding London or San Juan, in the way you use cards to play cards.  It is not a beautiful game, and maybe flows a bit slow (it is not easy to develop your civilization).  Anyway, interesting game.

This little box contains a big game. A lot of things going on between invention cards, resources, settlement tokens and god/disaster cards.

I played it three times and I don't know yet how to play it well, I mean, you have to balance different level of invention cards (build only the highest and you'll be out of the game). It's very important being able to get resources every turn and spend them building settlements as often as you can.

Great game. Rating only can go up.

RATING: 8
A decent light- to middle-weight card game of civilization building.  The main mechanics are hand management and action point allowance.  The game ends pretty quickly so you cannot plan to build (or build over) many technologies, and you must be selective in what you build.  The city markers act as the game timer, and they are controlled both by luck and by player choice... so I'm interested to see how the game plays if people do not rush to build cities... however, the cost of the city discs increases as the game progresses so it's probably counter-productive to stall or turtle.

Others say:  light, short-but-meaty, similar to San Juan in some ways.

RATING: 7
Provisional rating, likely to rise. Thought I wouldn't like this after reading the rules - but was pleasantly surprised. A little dry but interesting, not exactly civ-lite, more an economic game with a CCG feel of combos. Plenty here to explore on the various routes to victory and opportunities to interact through forcing the game pace and the gods/disasters.

Overall like it - but needs more playings.

Cute little game that requires a decent amount of thinking for the short game time.  One complaint is that it feels like the game ends just as it's getting really interesting.  Chances are that you won't have time to do much with your fourth-level inventions, which is a pity because they're so cool!

Uruk is a civilization-themed card game, but definitely not a filler. You play inventions by collecting sets of cards and those inventions let you take further actions. The goal is to build the most cities/towns. 

Given that Beleqk really likes this game, I am sure I will get additional plays in. Familiarity with the cards will help to speed things up, but I have concerns about its replayability (the card pool is very limited) and its depth (or lack thereof). In the short term, however, we will surely enjoy our next plays.

RATING: 7
On the 2-player game: as the first reviewer said it's a very nice optimization game. The problem is that we played Glory to Rome just before and somehow the 2 games have a similar feeling. Glory to Rome has simpler mechanics and, considering these, is easier to play. But considering the many different and very important abilities of the structures makes it harder to play and makes each game vastly different. In our opinion there's a lot more tension in Glory to Rome than in Uruk.

To sum up: draw cards, play cards, get cubes, buy stones. The theme is barely there and the card powers don't seem balanced. Despite all of this, there's a great game in this. I think this would be a hit with more polished art and improved iconography.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Yes, another civ-lite game but certainly worthwhile trying.  Not entirely straightforward but not so much a brainburner as a challange, which is good.  The rules and iconography are are bit tricky in places - mostly due, I think, to there not being an english language edition, so the rough edges of the translation haven't been knocked off.  It claims to play in less than an hour but we took twice as long with only three on first play, We managed to knock off half an hour on second play, even though we increased to four, but it still felt a little on the long side for a nice light-middleweight. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Really cool little set collection/engine building game once you get past the horridly written English rule set.  There's definitely a puzzle to solve every turn as to how to most efficiently use your engine to crank out the necessary resources to build your cities, and you're always debating which inventions will be the most impactful for your civ.  I also really liked the gods and disasters which kept things unpredictable, forcing you to rethink how to spend your precious cards and resources!

Updated 7/12/10.

Uruk is a civilization-themed card game that pushes the boundaries of abstraction.  Players collect cards in a manner similar to collecting train cards in ticket to ride: either select from a limited face-up display or take your chances with the draw from the pile.  The goal is to collect sets of cards that can be played to build particular inventions.  Inventions largely translate to colored cubes, or cheaper inventions, and colored cubes translate to little white disks.  The disks are the game's core source of points, acting as a multiplier for whatever card they are associated with.  

Uruk is relatively language-neutral, thanks to a coherent iconography reminiscent of a poor-man's Race for the Galaxy.  This game won't be unseating that one when it comes to strategic potential, however.  The core mechanics produce a rich-get-richer, snowball effect that is offset only by the luck of the draw and a relatively unbalanced set of cards.  

If players are experienced, know the cards well, and are attentive to their opponents, then I have no doubt that Uruk can be a fun little game.  But, as it stands, its a 30-minute card game with needlessly colorful artwork, a pasted-on cliche theme, and disquieting futility.

It feels a bit like Innovation, but I'm not sure which one I like most. I think Innovation is more chaotic. 
It is quite critical to get cubes early on in order to get the cheap bonus markers compared to the last round, though the bonus cards balance this advantage. I would like to try it again now that I understand what's going on in the game, but I don't think it's a game I would like to play 5+ times.

This has become our default medium length 2 player game. We love Through the Ages as a 2 player game but only if we have 2+ hours to spare. Uruk plays in under an hour and although it could never match TtA, it does have a light civilisation engine building mechanism and there are some very interesting card combinations to explore. 

We haven't tried it with more players yet but I don't see downtime being a problem once new players have grasped the mechanics. 

Highly recommended if you can find a copy.

RATING: 5
Uruk is a curious game. In some ways, it is a very stripped down game based on the genre that it's part of (Civ style games) but it seemed overwrought given its length and overall depth.

Anyway, this is a rather difficult game for me to explain. Players build inventions. The inventions sometimes relate to making cubes, or to making future inventions and to make buying things like city discs (the use for the cubes and a major VP generation source) more inexpensive. The inventions become more sophisticated in what they can do and how effective they are as the game goes and are driven by cards which come in 4 colours. Playing them requires having either exactly matching cards (preferable for efficiency) or spare pairs of matched colour cards to throw as wilds. Cards are picked up from a face up draft pool or straight off the deck. All of these things require actions to do, and you get 3 a turn. Actions allow you to draw cards, build inventions, make the inventions do their thing (spit out cubes, &c.) and to buy city pieces. Occasionally, god cards come out of the deck and cause excitement (auctions where losers are penalized, or other more positive things). The game ends when a set number of city discs have been purchased.

This game seemed to work well enough, and it also seemed like there were a lot of combos and potential to explore. It didn't really click for me or excite me though, so I don't think I'm going to end up playing it all that much either. Everything seemed to fit together decently, but the players were all off doing their own thing for the most part, and though what we were doing had some interest (trying to figure out good combinations, some efficiency) it wasn't enough to really draw me in either. The game at its rawest seems to be based on the same thing that Caylus/Le Havre/et. all are: you start out with one type of cube, you try to morph it into another one and to build efficient combos, which in this case are controlled by cards. I'm not particularly wild about the aforementioned games, and the cards don't improve this one IMO.

Players develop their stone age village, by inventing technological advances, founding more villages, and turning villages into cities.  Mechanically simple, but challenging card game, where players take 3 actions on their turn.  They can invent stuff, costing cards, which gives them rule breaking powers.  They can take resources (cubes) via their inventions, or the inventions of others (discarding cards previously invented).  They can spend cubes on settlement stones to build new villages, or upgrade a village to a city.  The game plays through four epochs, with the settlement stone cost escalating forcing players to keep developing their technology or risk falling behind.  Gods and disasters pop up to toss a little controlled chaos at the players, and to keep the game moving by draining settlement stones.  Players score points based on technology level and settlement stones.  Brilliant little game - feels like a big box game in a small package.  Clever little touches, and some subtle player interaction that others may not notice.  Fans of San Juan may want to check this one out.

RATING: 7
Very interesting machine-building card game where you are trying to build up inventions with special abilities and score multiplying tokens.   It doesn't have much interaction, but there's a lot to consider in front of you and it moves quickly.  Somehow the lack of interaction didn't bother me that much.   One other complaint:  the colors are red, pink,yellow and blue...   the red and pink are too similar.   Weird choice, but not a big deal.

Uruk:  Cradle of Civilization.  Scratches a little bit of the itch for a Civ-Lite game, but there's no map and no trading.

Nevertheless, an interesting game with satisfactory components.  Limited resources and multi-use cards make for engaging strategy decisions.  Lacks slightly in theme integration, but nevertheless a fine game.

RATING: 8
This another of the engine building card games that we all know so well. Being a fan of most, if not all of these titles, Uruk is a welcome addition in my games. The limitation of 5 inventions is a new addition, and the building of inventions, settlements are both innovative enough to be fresh.

The physical apperance of the game is pretty poor. Bad colors, bad art, awful icons, but a great game. As my friend eloquently put it: "It's a great game but it's butt-ugly...also there's a troll on the side of the box for some reason."

Reflecting on this game more and approaching 10 plays: 

What I really enjoy about this title is the subtle effects of the cards. Yes, the inventions build strength as the game progresses but they do not have the punch of the combos seen in other engine builder games. What you're left with is a game that makes every action important, especially the early ones. 

The event cards are also a nice addition. Since they are revealed, and shortly after activated, you have a little time to get ready for them. Their various effects add just a little (but not too much) uncertainty to an otherwise tight game.

A nice and quick civilization card game that lacks that something. I liked playing it but I'm not eager to play again. There's simply nothing new nor unique in the gameplay or the design itself.

On the other hand it's much more accesible then many others games of this kind so why not give it a try?

The iconography requires some getting used to it but other than that there's virtually no entry barrier to Uruk. You just sit and start playing.

RATING: 8
Fascinating little short-but-meaty game.  You're collecting sets of cards and then playing them in front of you as inventions. Each invention has a special power that can be activated once it is played. Many of these powers are ways to get goods cubes in four colors. The goods cubes can then be traded in for settlement disks, which are your primary way of scoring points. The disks are placed in front of an invention card and score points equal to the number at the top of the card. So the invention cards are useful both for their special abilities and for their ability to score points in combination with the disks.

Play is swift with just three actions per turn. There is a menu of actions to choose: draw a card, play an invention, activate an invention, buy a settlement disk, or trade cards in hand for cubes. You're very much working in your own sandbox here, except for an occasional auction or contest of strength when special disaster or god cards are drawn. There is also constant competition to get the cheapest settlement disks before they run out.

The game Uruk most reminds me of is Jambo. Both games are about pulling off little combo sequences in order to get goods or points or more combo machinery. With Jambo, the first plays were the most enjoyable and I eventually traded the game away (although I'd still gladly play if asked). Uruk could suffer the same fate, but so far I'm very impressed.

I’ve heard good things about this game and I really like civilization themed games. And I must say I am a bit disappointed about it. I’ve played it two times and I reckoned that the first game was a trying game, as there are many symbols in the game despite having the cheat sheet. During the second game I had better understanding about the game I could make tactics about it. It just wasn’t fun for me to play it. Maybe it is all the symbols or it might be that some cards seems to be overpowered and it’s easy for a player to get an edge in the game, without other players being able to stop it.

An interesting combination of a rummy game and a civ building game. Players put down sets of cards to increase the ability and value of their civilization. They can also build villages and cities to increase value. Different God or Disaster cards come up for auction during the game which can help or hurt. Very satisfying for the short (one hour) play time.

La puntuación otorgada es para una sola partida a dos jugadores.

Uruk Es un juego de cartas de los hermanos Kuhn que nos traslada al ascenso de la civilización Sumeria, En Uruk los jugadores despliegan cartas de inventos, realizan invenciones, recolectan recursos y construyen asentamientos y ciudades, también hay buenos y malos eventos que modifican el juego según se desarrolla.

Uruk llamó poderosamente nuestra atención debido a que tenemos otro juego de los hermanos Kuhn: die Wiege der Renaissance. un juego bastante curioso e innovador en cuanto a su mecánica y desarrollo.

Los componentes son correctos y las ilustraciones son lo suficientemente claras, con una ayuda de juego para explicar las cartas es suficiente para memorizar los iconos y no tener que estar consultando dicha hoja continuamente.

De los dos juegos de cartas a los que mas me apetecía probar, este y Traders of Carthage, sin lugar a dudas me quedo con un Uruk mas dinámico y con mas tensión.

Es un juego bien desarrollado y con un ritmo rápido, funciona bastante bien con dos jugadores y la única pega achacable hasta ahora es la extraña mecánica que utiliza el juego para los eventos y los desastres.

A nice (pasted on) civilization card game that plays in an hour. The game suffers a bit as some cards are overcomplicated and could have been much more polished. Same goes for the rulebook which is kinda confusing as there´s no real structure.

However, it´s a good (pretty much solitaire) game, atleast with 2 players (it will take longer with more players, but shouldn´t be different otherwise).

Being one of the ugliest and obscure gamea I own, Uruk is actually quite amusing. Contrary to the title, it really is not a fool-blooded civilization game - it is only a quite clever system draped with a little civ-ish flavour.

Oct09:

First Play Impression:

Yea, it was in german.  But I don't think that was the problem.  The only text on the cards wouldn't have mattered anyway.  The icons were only so helpful.

The actual play was pretty simple.  I felt stagnant a couple times though.  I didn't feel the need to keep drawing cards.  Maybe that was newbish.

The biggest failure was constantly looking up what the cards did.  Of course, that turned me off of RftG too at first.  Maybe this one deserves another couple plays.

I really like how only half the disasters drawn come into effect.  In particular I enjoy the variety this adds to the game.

The jury is out.

I feel bad about this rating.  There is a lot of cleverness in this game.  I admire the objective of a quick playing civ/tech tree game.  They almost nailed it, but not quite.

There is a glaring problem with Uruk, and they basically ignorned it.  The game has almost no player interaction, and compounding the problem, an obvious catch-the-leader failing.  Furthermore, the God and Disaster cards are not targeted to fix the problem (thought that would have been a good use for them).  Instead, they aggravate the rich-get-richer issues of the design.  The cycle can begin from the first hand, where cards are randomly dealt, and you can end up with a good hand that accelerates your victory or a bad one.  A standard first hand would have been a better design decision.

All-in-all, a disappointment.  I want to like it, but the issues here won't let me.

After 1 play.  Preliminary rating.  Might go up as well as down.

This is quite interesting card game.  Although a bit complicated, chiefly because a lot of different cards doing different things.  But once each player knows more or less most of the cards, gameplay is very smooth with minimal downtime.  And contrary to Race for the Galaxy, you don't have the feeling of being steered by the game or luck (and not the opposite way).

All in all, I'll gladly play more to check out fun factor, level of competition/emotions and replayability.

Light card game in the vein of something like San Juan.  The icons on the cards are a bit difficult to decode so it will take a play or two to get up to speed on the game.  Pretty solid game for the playing time.

There also seems to be a variety of winning strategies so far and nothing have emerged as dominant.

RATING: 5
Clever implementation of the tech tree into a hand management / set collection game. It just lacks a catchup mechanism, or some kind of direct conflict tech. If the god/disaster cards come up just when you've used up your resources to build settlements (and you need to grab these pretty much every chance you get), too bad. Too random and a little bland, more variety in the earlier stages' techs could spice it up.

Played twice, 2p & 3p.  This is not a bad tableau building game, in the same vein as Race for the Galaxy.  There is a bit of player interaction, with global events that trigger various types of auction for various rewards.  But, this doesn't really do anything new or different.  Better with more than 2.

RATING: 8
Excellent little card game in which you seek to develop efficient inventions that work well together to accomplish upgrading your technology and city building.  Different gods and disaster cards create opportunities for havoc or reward to spice up game play.  I wish it was more language independent.  I expect the first play for most people will be somewhat frustrating, but as we played, we really started getting a good feel for the game.  First play may take long, but I expect future plays to take much less time in the 30-45 minute range.  There is some luck in the card draw that may frustrate some people, but there are ways to work around it.  It has been fascinating to see the different invention/point potential combos each time I play the game.

Very little interaction between players in the game outside of the auctions for the different god and disaster cards that come into play, but I don't find myself being bothered by the relatively solitaire play.  If someone else plays an invention, it will generally be more difficult for someone else to play that same invention.

Sweet spot is three players in my book although teaching it two player may be ideal as it is more forgiving.  I'm finding that two player is almost too easy to pick up desired inventions and build them easily and the settlement stones go to quickly.  Two player game seems to lack the tension a three player game often provides.  Four player can find playing inventions more difficult as it is hard to plan to pick up certain inventions as the cards are distributed across too many people.  However, it isn't a horrible game with four and I'd prefer it with four over two.

I also like that there are several paths to victory.  I used to think that whoever got the most settlement stones would win, but that has been proven false many a time.  The other special victory cards and a couple of the god tiles and even disaster tiles allow for different ways to win.

Impression after first play: promising. A very short, light game. The civ-flavour is thin, but for a game that short it's ok. Interaction comes through bidding with the god and catastrophe cards.

Don't let the small packaging fool you this is an economic engine game with some tough decisions to make.  You're basically building inventions that give you some type of power (there are a lot of cards that work well in combo with each other), collect resources to build towns which create VPs and try to mitigate disasters.

Just don't get behind early because the victory point opportunities become harder to come by as the game progresses (there are less of them and they cost more).

I feel there's something rather special here, even behind the mediocre art and the lack of English version. Uruk is essentially Roll Through The Ages meets San Juan, with a little bit of God-complex thrown in. And it works peculiarly well, with plenty of effect-comboing that we have grown to love from the likes of Glory To Rome and similar. With a good player aid or crib, it should be relatively easy to dive straight in.

My Artscow deck, with proper card annotations, is indeed a step up on the original.

A nice game of tradeoffs where your focus is developing your two score multipliers - getting higher valued cards into your display (this costs cards and actions) versus buying village/city stones that multiply the value of these cards. The latter costs resources, which are gained by actioning your developed card powers, and also cost actions. As there's not enough time in the game to fully develop everything, your aim is to develop a strategy using the cards you acquire (through a draft, also costing actions), and build higher valued cards and multiplier stones more efficiently than others with the 3 actions you have each turn. Whilst having enough cards and resources to bid your way out of trouble when the inevitable catastrophe cards emerge. There's lots to like, and I'm looking forward to exploring this more to see how different card combinations work together, but there are some downsides, notably the iconography (similar to Roma) is difficult to understand so the game can't be played without continual reference to player aids for the cards, and the rules are long to explain for what turns out to be not that complex a game.

RATING: 9
"Rare but very good tableau game with card play similar to San Juan, but cube generation/conversion similar to Caylus Magna Carta."

What I like:

- Meaty tableau-building game in a small box
- Abilities on cards are fairly simple in scope
- Gods/disasters are clever
- No direct attacks; not too much leeching

What I don't like:

- Feels VERY overwhelming at first, with no idea what to do (especially without the Artscow cards)
- Poor colors (red and pink?) and unclear iconology
- I wish each color was more thematic
- The English rules translation and references are a bit rough in spots

The hand and tableau construction aspects feel quite a bit like San Juan. The resource cube and settlement aspects remind me somewhat of Caylus Magna Carta. But the game really isn't like any other. It definitely deserves a reprint.

During our first game, this felt like a weight of at least 3.0. By the end of the first game, we felt like we kind of understood what the heck just happened, and after the second game, I can see where the BGG-voted 2.5 weight comes from. After 5 games, I still don't have a clear idea of what strategies and combinations are best.

Aside from our first learning game that took 90 minutes, most games at any player count are running about 75.

Based on one play: I made the mistake of playing this for the first time with six players, which makes the game very confusing and hard to follow. Since each card has a different ability and building and getting cubes or cities is not as straight forward as you would think, the come did not go so well. You basically just use cards to make inventions, collect cubes to build cities on those cards and your score, at the end, is the value of the cards times the value of the city. But as each card has a different ability, you really need to take the time to decide, but at six, it is too long and confusing as what others do can effect you if certain cards are in play.

RATING: 6
This is a card game in which you're playing cards to a tableau that help you get resources, which in turn help you play more cards and build up those cards by putting discs on them.  Ostensibly it has a civilization theme, but like many heavily abstracted games, it doesn't really feel like a civ game.  The various cards come in levels, and the deck is stacked so that you don't see the higher cards until later.  There are events in the game too, which ended up being a little wonky, as they seemed to want to be a catch-up mechanism, but there were often many-way ties, and weird things happened if multiple events came up at once.  As a game, I thought this was okay, but nothing special.

Quirky, quick "civ" card game in which you display cards to generate and modify resources which are needed to purchase stones that improves your score.

Reminded me of San Juan with some disasters in the draw pile to spice things up abit and add a little tension: firstly I like it that there is no text on the cards as you can see icons from across the table (and become 2nd nature as the game progresses), but the discard payment method is not at smooth as in San Juan (if I remember rightly) as you pay with like-value cards at the cost of the card played minus one.

Some of the rules sound like lawyer-speak but towards the end the plays started to make sense and I think I prefer this over San Juan (though I understand it can be frustrating) but still alittle dry.

RATING: 6
Yet another cube-pushing, theme-pasted-on, multi-player solitaire Euro like Race for the Galaxy and San Juan. This would merit a maximum rating of 4 except for the fact that it plays fast and not as convoluted as RftG and SJ!

The main decision here is interesting: to either take cubes or to take cards. You need cubes to build settlement stones, which act like multipliers for end-of-game scoring. There are in limited supply. The interesting part is that you could build these easily *without* drawing that many cards! You could simply let your "economic engine" run and easily build lots of these stones. However you need cards to score points (you multiply the value of these cards with the number of stones) -- but a lot of these cards *do not* give you those valuable cubes. And you're limited to five cards ...

As for player interaction ... RftG and SJ address this with role selection. There's no role selection here; only card-drafting. There are god and disaster cards that pop up; when this happens, players have an auction to see who gets the benefit or penalty, but these seem to add variety to the game rather than interaction; they don't happen that often and are not that beneficial or disastrous. So, to me, the main player "interaction" is paying attention to your opponents to make sure you're ahead in collecting those settlement stones.

RATING: 9
A GREAT card game that utilizes the maximization mechanic in a smooth system.  A kind of Civ lite with the theme integrated very well.

The learning curve is a bit of a bear only because it will take a play or two to decipher the icons on the cards. Each one has a special ability, which are very important for play. Although, it's well worth the effort and highly recommended.

Addendum: An updated Artscow edition is now available with English aids on each card! A must buy for anglophiles!

Uruk: Wiege der Zivilisation -- 

Played once; three-player.

Our one session ran quite long.  We took a long time to go over the rules — partly due to a lack of clarity regarding "phases", "actions" and "card functions". Then the game itself took us quite a while to play.

I made lots of mistakes (some of them real doozies), and I took a distant last place, but along the way, I began to grasp the game's underlying gestalt. Now I just need to play it again soon, so I can solidify that grasp. 

I expect that after another play, I'll have lots of comments, because there's something about this game that really appeals to me.

Played 1 3P game. I felt a little overwhelmed by the rules at first, especially when it came to replacing inventions, but the game was simple and flowed much smoother than I expected. The Gods and Disasters are an interesting tweak to the design, although I am not sure whether the catch-the-leader mechanism is a little too advantageous. An interesting resource management game, although a little more variety in the inventions would have been nice.

Great abstract power/resource card game cleverly disguised as a civ game.  As someone that isn't a big fan of pure drafting games, the powers on all the cards made for entertaining actions outside of just grabbing cards for set collection.  It is quite tactical, as you are only going to take the best stuff available for you at the time rather than going for a grand strategy.  That said you can plan a few turns ahead and each turn can add to your planning and you can put foresight into planning a number of small decisions that add up to grander results.  

This game often feels like parallel play, but there are events that you have blind auctions into, but you can see your fellow player's resource pool, so it is important to pay attention to what they are doing if you want to compete with them when the time comes.  

There are some god cards that help those that are running behind that can be manipulated to slingshot you ahead.  Other than that though there isn't an standard way to catch up other than fate.

Also, as per usual with a drafting game, there are decisions that you can make in order to prevent other players from getting what they need.  Often this kind of game would outlast its welcome, but it is concentrated fun.  It is just the right length.  The game ends about a turn before you are ready for it, which is good, because it makes you want to go back for more.

This is a civ-themed card game. Cards represent inventions in 4 levels of technology, each of which gives you different abilities (e.g., produce cubes in 1-4 colors, or manipulate cubes, or modify costs, etc.). You get VP mostly by buying discs to place onto the cards, which are multipliers for the level of tech of that card. The costs of these discs increases as the game moves onward.

It's actually a pretty good economic efficiency game: build your little civ by choosing your technologies, which you can crank for point multipliers. But watch out for those (random) god events!

In the end, though, it wasn't good enough to hold onto -- too many other more engaging games out there!

I need to play this more to really dig into it.

It's entirely possible that it's balanced to the point of blandness (our first game came down to the third tie-breaker) with players who've done badly being given enough leg-ups throughout to drag them back into contention.

That said, I quite enjoyed the first play of it, mystifying icons and all.

It's really just a tableau-building game like St Petersburg with a chunk of engine/combo building but feels different enough to me that I enjoyed it.

Update: Scores remain close, but I haven't felt any blandness at all in recent plays; they've felt tight and interesting. The number of Gods which come up really affect the game and in my last three plays barely any have come up, so the catch-up mechanisms, whilst present, are far from guaranteed to appear.

Rating up from 7 to 7.9.

Neat little game, though I will need to play it more to see just how much replay value it has for me.

I enjoy the mechanics of creating inventions and building villages and cities, though it's all very odd thematically, making the game quite abstract. The event cards - the gods and disasters - are neat, but seem very out of place and can add quite a bit of randomness to an otherwise methodical game.

German language. Couldn't resist the civ theme, thick white settlement discs, and underdone artwork and style reminiscent of Innovation. (Uruk's basic colors are red/pink/blue/yellow, with orange card backs. Strange but charming.)

Unfortunately I find the game a touch boring, in the style of Race for the Galaxy: Mostly solitaire, puzzling out how to turn randomly presented opportunities into the most effective engine for scoring, and few big surprises.

It's not nearly as bad as RFTG though, as there's less randomness (you rarely draw randomly from a deck), fewer different types of cards to worry about learning, and some interactive mechanisms. Primarily there is a race to buy up settlements while they're cheap, reminiscent of Caylus Magna Carta. There are also some random events that favor the trailing player, and a rule that you can trade cards for cubes provided that somebody has that card constructed in their tableau.

The gist of it: Build cards ("inventions") using cards in your hand, generate cubes ("resources") from built cards, build settlements on built cards mostly using cubes. Settlements are a multiplier for the built cards' VP value.

A fun card game that does feel a bit like building a civilization.  But not strongly enough tied to the theme, of course.

My two games with three players were both interesting. My rating might go down over time - I will have to play more to be sure.

The game itself has nice ideas and solid mechanics. But why is the iconography such a mess? The artwork is ugly and the icons ambigious in their meaning. Could be great but actually isn't in this condition.

Fun little Civ light card game. Build cards which give you abilities such as getting a cube of a certain colour, getting a discount on future buildings, points at game end, etc. Use the cubes to buy and build villages and cities, which makes the cards you've built worth more points at game end. Gods and Disasters occur occasionally, which give benefits to those furthest behind or who bid the highest, or punish those who bid the least. 

Nice "early warning" system for these, in that the God or Disaster first comes into play, and then triggers later. Thus you often have time in which to prepare for the event.

This is a game that doesn't lend itself to being learned from the rules, just because the setup and some of the concepts of the game aren't the most intuitive.  The good news is that the game, once learned, is worth the effort.  It seems to be a little too dependent on drawing the right card at the right time, but the different options that the cards give you, when played, allow players to come up with a particular strategy to apply during the game.  What's interesting is that there's only one way to score points -- by having civilization discs -- but the different cards in the game let you try different ways to collect them.  I'm looking forward to further plays of this game.

Civ building filler card game.  I want to get the expansion to try it with 6 players.

A lot of a game in a small box. Building an engine to enable you to build cities to get the points. A second playing may increase score to an eight but it seemed like a game I had played before so was nothing paricularly new.  Also, maybe because it was my first play but, it felt like sometimes the only thing worth doing was to do a, b and c, this happened alot in the effort to get cubes to build cities.  A second play is warranted.

I'm not quite sure why this one doesn't get more love.  Reasonably well implemented theme.  Set collection with a well designed escape hatch if you can't get the cards you want.  Lots of options/variability for scoring points due to special power cards.  Relatively fast play time.  All in all, interesting game with lots of options.

No le encontré la gracia. Demasiados símbolos a tener en cuenta. Aún así, relativamente buen intento.

I'm still not totally sure how I feel about this, but it's pretty interesting.  My uncertainty stems from not being sure how much control one actually has, but I think ultimately the player is in charge.  Very interesting!

A bit too solitaire for my tastes...

A cool game with a mediocre ruleset.  House rules make it great.  Only complaints are difficulty in organzing, and flimsiness of some of the models, particularly older ones.

An interesting game. I like the theme very much. I don't like the CCG part sadly. It is interesting to play it from time to time just for the amusement of being a pirate. Arghhh!

The gameplay may not be amazing, but my kids love it. The combination of the minis, the hunt for gold, and combat really appeals to them. (And to me! I have fun with the collectible aspect, too. Quite (unfortunately) addictive.)

RATING: 4.5
The ships are really good, but the actual game is a bit boring and doesn't really live up to expectations. The "collectability" also completely ruins the balance.

Pirates is another game I used to play a long time ago at my local hobby shop but sadly it was one of those games that was just a "phase" and didn't stick around long. When I was a kid, I wasn't sure why the game died off like it did, but replaying it years later made me realize why it did. Don't get me wrong, Pirates is fun but it's a gateway game to playing other tabletop miniatures games. It has a lot of features that games like Warhammer have such as a point system for making a team of ships, special movement/attack rules, and miniature ships you build. I think the game is awesome because it's cheap and you get a lot out of a booster pack (3-4 ships, 1 or 2 crew members, about 10 coins, and an Island in each booster) but the gameplay is somewhat lacking. Turns feel very limited and the strategy behind it can be somewhat boring at times. Pirates to me is unique because it's not like other tabletop miniature games but at the same time, it could be a lot better.

RATING: 6.5
A light miniature sail game that everything is contained in a small pack. Rules are simple, card ships are beautiful with multiple island add ons.

The down side is the 'CCG' part. Ended up with multiple similar ships from different packs.

Simple dice it out miniature game playable on a table even smaller than a standard 4' by 4'.

Awesome little game. Great concept too. Like warhammer for people on a budget. Great game for such little cash (About $5 gets you started for 2 players). Be forewarned though, the little ships break very easily when removing the sails. Glass Counters can easily be used instead of removing the sails to solve this problem though.

The bits are way too cool.  The gameplay itself is very close to Wings of War (not the rules per say, but the feel of the game play).  I wish it wasn't collectable...

RATING: 4
It's the Pirate's Cove of collectible games, one might say. Fun to handle and ogle the components, but the gameplay is sorely lacking. For what it's worth, this hasn't stopped by from buying an absurd number of pygmy pirate ships - if you're thinking of "just picking up a few models for this other game I have", be careful.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not a bad game, but probably would be better with some modifications. There seems to be some inequity inherent with the random selection of getting ships, yes I realize that is the "fun" of collectible card games, but there may be too much inequity based on what kinds of ships you end up getting.

The Pirates CSG has a ton of potential. The rules are simple, the theme is fun, and the art is spectacular. Unfortunately, I don't feel that Wizkids has used the potential the game has effectively. Purchasing new cards does not add much in the way of new gameplay choices, it merely gives you a lot more of what you already have. If you are interested in the Pirates CSG, I'd suggest limiting yourself to one or two sets of cards. 

My favorites sets are Pirates of the Spanish Main, Pirates of the Crimson Coast, Pirates of the Revolution, and Pirates At The Ocean's Edge.

I love the flexibility of gameplay and decisions without being over complicated. Exactly what I would hope for in a miniatures game. Also, putting the ships together and taking them apart makes the set up and take down feel almost like a hobby in itself. :-)

RATING: 5
My girlfriend bought me some of packs of this as a goof because I love pirates.  I love the little plastic ships, although the game itself isn't terribly interesting.  

The rules that come in the packs themselves are awful, and the ship masts snap pretty easily if you're not insanely delicate.

Will probably use the ships as components for other games more often than the game they were designed for.

I really like the idea of this game, and the mechanics, models and look, but it just kinda fell flat for me.  Ryan and I bought some ships, played some games, tried to get really excited about it, bought some more, played some more, and then quit trying and shelved it.  Ho hum.  Really cool island expansion available using pre-painted resin islands.  Neat.

This game is broken...literally.  I bought two packs to try the game out, and out of the 4 ships I got, I broke a mast and bent a mast.  And I'm a 30 yr old with a good amount of patience.  Now, could I try and get it replaced, or glue it? Yeah. But, putting in and taking out the masts play a major part of the game.  Neat idea, poor execution.

The maneuvering and fire rules are more appropriate to a game about hydrofoils equipped with autocannon turrets.

Just bought a couple of packs to check them out with a view to having them as a "beer & pretzels" game and for use as 'minis' for on my Flying Colors maps.
They're a little on the large side for the FC maps but if it helps 'hook' another player into FC by utilising that ruleset,playing the two to three ship scenarios, then it's a win-win in my book!

Collect and assemble a pirate fleet (or Spanish, English etc. for that matter) and set out to blow away your opponents. Unfortunately, the only thing that will end up getting blown away - in the long run, 'cause admittedly, it is dead fun to start with - is your bank balance. So, buy a couple of fleets cheap if possible, and dig down the rest of your gold for later use. Just some advice from a compulsive CCG shopper.

The models are kickass fun to put together! They look great too. Unfortunately, the game rules themselves are a bit too simple and lame to make this a fun game. There's lots of potential there, with the great eye-candy provided by the ships and islands and gold coins, but the play just isn't engaging enough. Perhaps a variant or two would spice things up properly, but I lack the interest to design or research them. Maybe someday.

I REALLY want to like this game. I Love the ships, love the dice, love the concept. But I've found that the somewhat free-form miniatures genre just doesn't cut it for me.

At first I was drawn in by the nautical theme, as I'm a lifelong boat nerd.  I don't consider myself a minis player, but this won me over, mostly because the pieces can be pushed back into their cards, making it as portable as a card game.  Like most other PotSM fans, I find the game more enjoyable with many house rules.

Hmm, I've played this some more and still can't find any fun in it.  The theme and components make this one look like it should be a blast, but it's definitely a lot less fun than it looks like it should be.  I'm generally a huge fan of these type of light and easy to play games, but the gameplay is just plain crappy.  There are no interesting decisions to make whatsoever; run for the islands and hope you get get your gold home faster, wheee!  The battle rules are laughable, since you can't move and shoot in the same turn without the correct crew.  This cuts out all tactical shooting possibilities, as you always have to open yourself up to getting shot in order to make a shot for yourself.  I'm glad it sold out before I had a chance to buy it so I didn't waste my money!  A huge disappointment.

Collectable games are a money pit and usually suck. This game is pretty weak but the ship models are really quite well done. Best not to take the masts out too frequently as they are liable to snap. The ships could be great for making up your own games or replacing dull bits in other games. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I got WAY too into this game back in the day.  Fun gameplay, simple mechanics, and fleets of tiny plastic boats.

Some of the expansions started feeling a little bit "same-y" as the game went on; ship abilities were often repeated and new mechanics didn't necessarily add much to the gameplay.

Definitely a casual game, but compared to other CCGs I rank this one much higher, if only for the constructible, 3D nature of the cards.

This is a really fun little pocket miniatures game that was a great concept.  The WizKids were victims of the 2008 crash/recession/depression.  Topps bought them out and promptly killed the game series.  The only thing I didn't like was that the card models were a little fragile.  I snapped a mast in half while assembling one ship.  Fun game.  I need to break it out and have a play again soon.

This game sucks.  Flat out, this game sucks and is one of the worst purchases I have made in years (of _any_ product).  The rules are like a bad joke (since when do ships have cannons in their _masts_ or how can they turn 180 degrees on a dime?), the gameplay is paralyzingly stupid (islands?  Who cares, just blast the other ships broadside!), and those little ships?  Fragile!  I am completely embarassed to have been suckered into spending money on this based on the "coolness" of the little pirate ships, which incidentally, all pretty much look alike when assembled barring a hazy, poorly printed name on the side.  Honestly, The game could be improved with more clarity and sophistication in the rules but as it stands it's too basic and nonsensical to even be worth playing.  There's no way you can play the full game without buying many packs as you probably won't get the right crew to match up with your ships in just a few packs.  Seriously.  I got all pirate crew and all English and Spanish ships in my three packs and I am not willing to purchase more. Sure, you can just use the crew on whatever ships you want but the fact that it's written in the rules just to make people buy more irks me to no end. I'll spend my my money on a complete game, not on trying to find it hidden amongst countless packs of cards.  The designers clearly opted for playability over simulation but in doing so stripped the game of any theme, flavor, or simulation at all.  The rules as written are awful, full of holes, and gameplay always seems to reveal situations that aren't covered by the rules.  Steer clear of this piece of trash and spend your money on Pirate's Cove or an old copy of AH's Blackbeard instead.  I don't want to hear the excuses "This is for kids", "it's just a simple game", "it's about the models"...you could say the same things about Heroscape, and it's a 10 all the way.  There's no excuse for a game being this poor.  The real pirates of this game are Wizkids, who are trying to make off with your money that you could be using to support good games instead of this driftwood.

I bought one of the starter packs that came with a bunch of ships and played this game once with my girlfriend.  The ships were a pain to put together (I actually thought this part would be fun!)  The game wasn't too fulfilling.  I got the sense that having a bunch of ships to choose from would make the game more enjoyable...again, the major failing of any collectible game: low replayability unless you keep buying the stuff.

The game itself is somewhat interesting, either you try to collect gold or you kill your opponent's ships, or both.  I realized at one point that if I was able to sink one of her ships that had a certain amount of gold, then I'd win the game...so there's definitely strategy.  I just resent that I have to buy more to have more fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The potential for this game to be good is there, but WizKids really blew it on development.  The points values on the ships are completely askew.  There's a ship in the first expansion which, for 10 points, gives you 8 cargo space.  I don't have a ship in my entire collection that has 8 cargo space, and almost none of my ships for 10 points or less have more than 3 or 4.  Combo that with a character from Crimson Coast that lets you fill a single ship's cargo hold with characters *for free*, and the game was over before it started.  It was horrifically broken in terms of play balance and I'll probably never play it again.

Bought some packs on clearance (Pirates at Ocean's Edge, Pirates of the Cursed Seas Fire & Steel) to keep my 8 y.o. happy during downtime on vacation and it worked GREAT for that.  We haven't played the game, but the building kept him occupied and happy.
Read the rules for the game and am pretty put off by the fact that during combat, the masts of the ships are removed to indicate damage.  These things break so easily to begin with -- WHY would we want to voluntarily pull them apart, put back together, repeat, repeat -- just asking for broken pieces?
So, in summary, I guess -- good purchase on clearance for kids who love to build stuff (but beware the fragility).  Game sounds a bit bland, though.

We have about $50 worth of this collection, a mix of packs from Pirates of the Spanish Main, and Pirates of the Crimson Coast (the first expansion available).  Many more expansions have been issued since then, but I haven't paid attention to any of them.
I must have about 2 dozen ships???  A 2-player pirate ship game played on a table top.  I like it.  I had bought it for Daniel, but he didn't really look at it, so I kept it for myself.
I found a receipt from April 12, 2005 for 2 Crimson Coast packs and 1 Spanish Main pack, at $4.99 each.  (The receipt is in my Carcassonne The Castle game.)  The game can be played with a single pack, but with multiple packs available, there is more variety to choose from.  I remember buying our first packs from West Edmonton Mall.  These would have been after that.  They added the Crimson Coast and Spanish Main themes after the original Pirates were available.  This is about the only collectable card game I have ever purchased - it's similar to buying hockey cards or baseball cards.

GREAT components, weak game. The game was designed by cereal box marketers. The laser-cut, constructable ships are just awesome. Best to buy a few for use with other games and just skip the playing of "this" game altogether -- thus the poor rating for the game aspect.

Ships are fantastic for what you'd expect coming out of a booster pack! A little difficult keeping the pieces from moving around on the board and the measuring, especially with kids, but all in all a fun game you can play without getting too deep ($$) into the collectable side.

The CCG'ness of this makes a lame game (no actual wooden ship sailing rules, just cannons on hoverboats) in to a horrible game (buy more packs to get a good English Captain?  pfft).  But the ships are great for Wooden Ships & Iron Men.  Ooh, or Man o' War maybe.

Light and frothy pirates miniatures game, that is collectible.  Packs come with two punch-out-and-assemble ships, an island and a sheet of crew/treasure.  Also incluced in each pack is a rulebook and a very tiny die.  Rules are very straight forward - move, shoot, loot or repair.  First to control half the loot wins.  The ships look amazingly good, are very durable, and snap back into their frames after play.  Rules are a bit holey (how do you leave an island?  Come about?), and combat doesn't feel quite right - once you move into range to attack, you could get shot to ribbons before your next turn.  Interested to see where this system goes.

Collectable. The more you have the better chance that games played will be different. Lots of crew and ships. The more packs you buy, the more competitive  you can be. Just like Magic: The Gathering.

The game looks very nice. Can take a lot of space on the table to play. Rules are simple. Can be fun for children or early teenagers, but grown-ups? You're gonna have to like the theme and mechanics of this game to enjoy it. Boring. Needs some work. Reminds me of Wings of War.

There are too many better games out there that playing this game on a regular basis is a waste of time.

I don't plan to play Pirates of the Spanish Main any time soon.

This game has received a lot of criticism from some extreme gamers, but I feel that this game is definately great.  I recommend not taking it too seriously, as that will definately kill the fun of the game.  If you use it as a casual, easy-to-carry game that you grab two seconds on the way out of the house, you will enjoy it lots.  

The gameplay is rather simple (some consider it rudimentary), but that serves it well as a casual, quiet, relaxing game.  If you are looking for an intense gaming experience, look elsewhere or use some custom rules (there is a custom, advanced rule set here on BGG).

Only 3 packs of this game per person (that's about $12 in-store) will take you far.  That will provide each player with six ships, three islands (half of what is required to play a full game), tons of treasure, and a couple of crew members/unique treasures to make the game more fun.  Once you go above three packs a person, you are starting to play the "pay to win" game and are merely sinking your money away.  Only buy more than three packs if you want to play the advanced, custom rules, if you like the ships enough to collect them, or if you just have money to burn ;-)  

Like I said, take it as a quick, casual, relaxing game that can be easily be carried (a single player's set can fit in a 1" hard plastic deck box), and you will enjoy it lots.  After all, what can you lose at $12 a person?

Granted, the ships are VERY neat and nicely realized, but there is very little satisfying gaming material here really. The combats are ridiculously simplified, and the idea of firing masts instead of cannons is strange. The value of found treasure is the hugest luck element of them all...
Basically this comes very close to childish games that you used to play with your toys as a kid, like "my soldier rolled a 5 and your soldier rolled a 3 so I win".

(As of [b]?[/b] plays) Unrealistic rules and shallow gameplay, perhaps, but that doesn't diminish the sheer joy I derive from constructing little tiny ships out of plastic cards and pushing them around a table shouting "Arrrr!" and "Fire as yer guns bear!" Unfortunately, the endless and increasingly surreal expansions jumped the shark.

Just not enough game here for me, bought a few starters and boosters but couldnt get enough bang to buck to make me continue with it. Games were over too quickly. I only had ships from first set, maybe later sets gave the game greater sea legs. Love the ships designs, just wish there was more to the game.

I'm such a sucker.  I hate the collectible aspect of CCGs.  So, how did I even get myself to buy my first pack of Pirates of the Spanish Main/Crimson Coast/Barbary Coast/Revolution??  Simple.  It's about pirates.  Who doesn't think pirates are the coolest?  The game is so incredibly simple and it's so much fun to build and play with little sailing ships out of a piece of plastic the size, shape, and thickness of a credit card.  Just enough strat to keep you on your toes.  I do wish WizKid's website had a better, all encompassing (this part is key) set of downloadable rules.  Nothing worse than having to reference this FAQ and that guy's website and this woman's house rules.  Puh-lease.  Super fun and very well themed game for as tiny as it is.  Only way this could be better is if they had ninjas.  And giant robots.  What kid doesn't like giant-ninja-pirate-robots?

This was the game of Gen Con UK 2007 for me.

While I don't really believe in rating games after only one play, I'll make an exception here. While the bits for PotSM were quite charming, the game play felt flat and uninspired. Very simplistic, and I was amazed at how little depth there was. This is one of those: "Play it once and you've seen everything there is to see" games. I could be convinced to try this again, but I don't know anyone who'd offer.

RATING: 2
Played 1 time. Utterly dull, and worse yet, the game practically forces you to buy lots of packs to be competitive (otherwise you won't have crew you need.) I'd rather player a far more interesting tactical game like Mechwarrior where you can play with 3 boosters and never have to buy another thing. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game have some of the most good and the most bad things I look for in a game. It's collectable (bad), but is inexpensive (good). It's simple (good), but sometimes childish (bad). Lots of ships (good), they look pretty all the same (bad). Lot of luck (bad), but also some simple strategy (not so good, but not bad surely). So, I think the fun that I feel playing it (in my self constructed, wooden map), make this game a full "6" distraction for some quick plays with friends.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The good: brillant physical design, portable, beautiful and visually appealing, simple and fast.
The bad: don't think this is a naval game, yes these are boats on water, but the shooting rules are counter-intuitive for anyone who ever played naval games before; shoot and move should not exist or all ships must have a captain; playtesting did not catch that some ships are completely useless?  Please compare the Harbinger to the Lord Algernon.  And what's the deal with the L+L Pirate ship?!?  The victory conditions make this ship an automatic pick with no downside (especially since it only costs 6) meaning that you have to have it.
The worst: forget big guns, forget tactics, go for speed and just pure speed.  Heck, forget the English and just play Pirate.  To make this game work, it is in dire need of thorough set of house rules.  It's too beautiful to just sit there on the shelf...

Both rating points for the nice ships. Zero points for the "game", because there isn't one. PotSM makes Wings of War feel like Puerto Rico. Clearly, the publishers put more thought into making the ships as cool as possible, and spent little or no time on the gameplay itself. Given that James Ernest was involved, this may be another instance of his rules being mangled beyond recognition. Anyway, it's pointless picking up more than a couple of packs (just to see the ships) since there's not much you can do with the game rules. As usual, the public gets to beta test a collectible game that's not at all ready for the market. (Fawkes recommends "Wings of War" instead.)

The ships are nice. The game.. not so much. If you want to play efficiently, it comes down to having the fastest ships race to the islands to grab the loot, hoping you have no cursed treasure and high numbers. Combat tends to get less as you play the game more often, since it is not necessary and only wasting your time, which you could use to grab more loot. It has been years since I played it, but it sadly fell flat for our group, even though we tried really hard to like it.

Kids at around age 10 rate this a 7.5 and adults rate it 6...averaged to about a 7 since the kids want to play more than the adults. We like to play casually, with some house rules (such as neither worrying about exact measuring nor how to measure). The bits are indeed terrific, however, it is very difficult for adults (here, at least) to distinguish between the different ships (writing is too tiny & dark). Part of the appeal to kids is that all is customizable...our kids like making house rules and adding their own "bits" & artwork to games they play (personally, I don't like to tinker with rules!) and this game lends itself perfectly to letting this creativity run wild. They have already made their own painted 3-D table and many of their own rules. More like a toy than a game.

A fun little game, with miniature ships that you don't even have to paint!  Huzzah!  Alas, collectible.  Never got into it hardcore.  There is an online version you can play, also.  (Yes, I am a moron and bought a $65 booster box of non-existent virtual ship cards to play online.  =:-/  )
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Eh...

Beautiful ships, nice theme, fun to put together...but playing it is rather awkward, and while the "all in one booster" idea is nice, actually measuring movement with those little cards is surprisingly clunky!

Fun for a diversion.  I would NEVER play this with only two players, that is BORING as you could possibly imagine.  Get five players to buy a booster each, lump them into a "collection", and make your own board game where you can draft crew and ships.

Not nearly as much fun as I'd hoped, and that was a BIG disappointment for me.


UPDATE:  Downgraded from "5" to "3".  Playing this is so clumsy and the system just isn't worth the work.  Without the cool ships this would be a "1".


UPDATE:  Am considering playing this on a grid-shaped board, using rough estimates for movement and firing.  That would solve a LOT of the clumsiness problems of playing this game.  I could see tweaking this to a very nice four-player pirate combat and treasure style game.  

Still, as is, the rating stands.



EDIT--Traded away in a math trade.  I fail to see what anyone sees in this game beyond the "oooh" of the components.  Downgraded game to a "2" in the process...I genuinely dislike it.

The ships are fun to build, and the graphic design is top notch.  It's too bad the movement rules are so annoying.  (try measuring distance with the edge of a card with several ships in the same area and you'll see what I mean)

Great, easy, simple game instantly playable... Sure, this is not a deep, tactical game... Its not supposed to be! I dont think its fair to rate it low just for that! :) 

The ships are amazingly beautiful, the rules are fast and eady... I wish there would be more collectible crew cards (now theres just 8 standard types, which is a shame), but with the expansion coming up (adding forts and some other new rules) this will be an even better game!! :)

Played the basic rules game with a work buddy during lunch.  First time to play.  My opinion is that I think the game has a much greater potential when using more ships and islands than the basic game calls for.

Good, but a bit underwhelmed. It's a simple game with a simple concept. I was looking forward to an intense pirate naval warfare game and I got what felt like, a silly treasure race. Changing the rules around can make the game a bit more enjoyable, and it was pretty fun at times. Overall, its a good yet over simplified game.

Despite my low rating for the game I own a bunch of packs of game cards for the system.  The components are just plain cool.  3D ships, forts and cute tiny, tiny dice.  Unfortunately there is not much of a game behind the glitz.  Buy the game for the components and use them with a much better system like "Wooden Ships and Iron Men" or your own house rules.

This Review includes all of this series. Great game, Lots of variations & combinations can be made with it. From specialized scenarios to fleet construction there are infinite possibilities. I have played this in a league format & casually with my kids & their friends, it works well with all skill levels. It can be as simple or as complex as you want. The only problem is finding players. This game was under appreciated in it's time. It's the Firefly of collectible games. I think if players knew what it could be it would still be around & I would need a lot more room to store these little ships.

RATING: 2.5
Somewhat boring Collectable Pirate Game.  Seems to have a slight imbalance to ships/crew (especially the captain which turns any 4-5 mast ship into a killer).  Game just seemed to be kind of pointless.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Pirate ships ROCK.  But pirate ships do not make 180 turns.  Pirate ships do not ignore wind.  Pirate ships do not have mast cannons.  Pirate ships cannot stop and go on a moments notice.  Yes, pirate ships rock - but these are NOT pirate ships.

A different CCG in that you make minitures from the creditcard plastic collectables. OK, but with the few pieces we tried this with the ships seemed awfully imballanced. With more ships (which I really don't care to buy) it could be good. Storing the assembled ships would be a PitA too.

This game is as dead as Davy Jones, but I loved it. You built plastic pirate ships from punch-out credit card sized cards.
They were cool!
I have hundreds of them. 
HUNDREDS.
Yes, useless "toys" stacked in binders under my writing desk. What's wrong with me?
I blame the developers.
They broke the game with eventual expansions, but at it's core, the rules were simple enough to give you the freedom to play any way you wanted. "Run for gold and get it back to your island." That was basically it. But you could do so much more. Pirate other players, sink them so they couldn't win, out-maneuver them, or just go at it in a full multi-player battle. 
Freedom is what the pirate lifestyle represented, and I think they got that dead on with this game. It has it's fans, and it's detractors, and it also has it's collectors who wanted nothing more than to possess each individual ship and didn't really play the game at all.
Did I mention I have HUNDREDS?
I think there was something here that could be revised into a solid game with a little effort. Maybe it will see a second life like Hero-clix, but I doubt it.
It was fun while it lasted.

Great ships. Please sell me the ships without all the other stuff, as the rules are currently a muddy mess and in need of a FAQ *badly* and the measuring system is just stupidly implemented to ensure maximum arguments. (Update: these work great on 1" hex grid for Wooden Ships and Iron Men!)

I really wanted to love this game and collected quite a solid collection of the first series, but it never really grabbed me. As many other have mentioned, it looks like a wonderful game and even seems like fun to collect for non-collectors like myself. However, once you start playing the game, it just never catches on. It's hard to explain, but it simply doesn't satisfy and leaves me puzzled as to why.

Supervision required! Whatever you do, don't let your kids open the packets and build the ships themselves. Mine managed to mix up the ship parts, started arguing over which bits they needed, and broke two of the masts trying to insert them in the wrong slots! Superglue to the rescue! The masts are way too fragile especially considering that they have to be removed as part of the game. To be honest, I only bought them for use in Plunder!

Great idea for a game but sandbagged by horrible production. The ships were credit cards with punched out areas. The consumer was expected to assemble a tiny plastic ship from this.

Collection: 3 collectible tins, maybe 20 or so booster packs total.
Interesting little strategy game that really shines in multiplayer. Despite how most collectible games work, you can shell out about $50 and be set for life with this one, at least if you don't intend to play competitively. The amazing little ships add a lot to the game, and building them is pretty fun as well. If you really want to add more rules, you can, but it works pretty well as it stands. The measuring gets very old after a while also, a problem I have with most minis games.

I really like this game. The only reason I turn down a game is my lack of fleat options/variation. Once I get more ships and learn my ships' powers better I suspect I'll get into it more. I really like the collecting aspect.  Even better than Magic as this game is 3D.

I don't care for detailed simulations, so Pirates of the Spanish Main's simple move and shoot system makes me happy.  You spend your time making the fun, high-level decisions (Where do I want to go?  Who do I want to shoot?) rather than tedious ones. (Have I accurately accounted for the current and wind velocity?  No?  I'm blown off course?  Crap.)  Okay with two players, but better with as many as you can convince to play.  I don't generally enjoy deck building, but putting together fleets for this doesn't annoy me for some reason.  This is the game that I wanted Car Wars to be.  The fact that it's played with pirate ships is even better!

Neat, fast little game with fun ships. I have yet to get a fortress (I want one bad but I refuse to get caught up in a collectible game). Only disappointment for me is the lack of factoring in wind for movement. Maybe that would over-complicate things.  Very easy to set up and play.

Ships look great. Novel idea. Pirates anything is fun. Don't necessarily like the collectibility, or the 'rip the sails off to denote damage'. The lack of good multi-player rules dampens my liking of the game though.

RATING: 6
There is a lot to this game, from its "collectable" category to the need for some nautical skills.  It also has super-cool pirate ships, other ships, monsters and subs.  

I have played this enough to respect it as a dice-dependent family game.  It is highly luck driven.  However, I am also working on hopefully simple rules to take wind into account for the game, requiring tacking and a half dozen other nautical components.  I hope to build this as an "Wooden Ships and Iron Men" simplification, giving that former game's appeal with the PotC flaver and speed.  We shall see.

The downside is that there is absolutly no navel history or tactics that you can use in this game. . . maybe if it were a run across a large island or something the theme would work better. . . I think that every ship should have a captain.  One other thing, if you do decide to start playing this, buy a tackle box!!

When I bought this game I was unsure if I would like it. Then I played it and I was instantly hooked. It's a Pirates life for me! It's a cool game that can be played on the cheap, especially if you dont plan on doing the tournament thing. Even then it would cost far less than trying to keep up with games like Magic or its like. Plus you get a collection of miniature pirate ships that look damned cool. How can you go wrong! :-P

Pros:
- Fun Inexpensive game. I loved the fact that each person could buy one pack and then play.  
- play anywhere
- could make some fun combos

Cons:
- I didn't like that you had to have crew of the correct nationality on your ship.  The crew should have been generic unless it was a unique person.
- the ship masts would break putting them together sometimes
- vague rules at times.

It's addictive but not quite like some other CCG (MtG, for example). The movement and combat system is innovative and worthy of notice. However, it lacks something that will bring me back to it time and again. One big problem, of course, is that individuals can spend more and have a better fleet and limit the importance of strategy.

EDIT: I, initially, scored this game higher but have dropped its score because of continued reconsideration.

I'm impressed with the styrene plastic card quality and the visual design of the various ships are exceptional.

Origins 2004 acquisition. Very much a "beer and pretzels" kind of game. The ships are quite cool looking and the cost of entry is cheap, so you really can't go wrong - just don't expect long, instense play sessions and you won't be disappointed.

Let me see... a sailing ship moving under the power of the wind can either (but not both) shoot or move during it's turn .  Umm simplicity should not equal crap.  However the implementation of a basic move of say a short or 1 hex if using a grid appeals to me.  That way you simulate the crew either tacking sail or manning the guns.

I was looking forward to playing this but ultimately was disappointed.  I was expecting something heavier; not sure why.  It was quite basic and simple.  The setup seemed very arbitrary.  The obstacles were easily avoidable.  And there really wasn't enough variety between ships.  Won't suggest this game in the future.

Meh...
A medium-fun game...
It has its limitations, I think tournaments will be hard to run, chaotic, etc.
The strategy as it stands seems a little truncated with the current rules, set-up...either run for treasure with fast ships, eluding OR big bad ship to cannon the heck out of opponents while a decoy runs treasure.
Maybe I need to play more, but this doesn't make the game poor...it is mostly a fun little romp, but not enough to keep me interested.
The theme, collectability and general gameplay is solid and enjoyable.

Not worth keeping in my collection; got rid of 5/07.

This is a game that, while the ships are a bit fragile, shouldn't have died out like it has. Pretty fun, easy to teach, but doesn't have a ton of variety with missions. I love making house rules/scenarios though, so it's fine with me. Also the combat is a bit lopsided in favor of the attacker, but a house rule of mine fixed that. The expansions make this game dope.

For $5 you get everything you need to play a game.  For a little bit more, you can start to collect it.  Then, the Pokemon bug gets ahold of you and you spend $100's.  So yes, its a CCG type game (minus a point).  The rules are not so good, could of been more clearly written.  The idea of a pirate ship game is excellent however!  The pieces are fun to put together and collect.  It is easy, but like other minature games, there's problems with it.  Overall, its fun, would play with again.  I'll probably buy a few more to play with. EDIT:  Downgraded the rating of this game, due to the fact I have no desire to play it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The idea is interesting, and the design is really ingenious. The collectability issue is also not that much important which is a good thing. But there are a few problem.

First, the ship moves too easily on the board. Maybe playing on a piece of cloth would prevent them to move. It's sometimes ambiguous if your can hit or not your opponent so it can lead to arguments according to who you are playing with.

For the rules, since you cannot move and shoot it will mean that you will always need to expose yourself to your opponent before being able to shoot. The only way to avoid this is by having bigger cannons, or having ship/character special abilites. The problem is that the core rule is patched by the special abilities which is not a good thing.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Interesting but the "collectible" aspect may turn me off from purchasing.  It's pleasant to play and I suspect you need a full complete set for balanced 1-on-1 or team vs team play.  Some combos for the SUPER big ships are simply too powerful.  If you like Mage Knight or HeroClix miniatures wrapped up in a Pirates theme, then you probably will like this.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great ships!  The theme makes it easy to role-play being a pirate on the high seas.

Love building the little ships, but the game play is tedious and unexciting. Tough to store also. We ended up putting each ship in it's own little baggy with it's card and then everything in a Tupperware box. We might make up our own rules just 'cause the ships are so cool. Oh and the masts break easy.

It's a quick, easy fun game to teach and play, and you can have a satisfying game with only a few packs.  However, I feel you may wish to place the islands a bit further apart than is listed in the rules, as it seems to be that having them so close together inhibited game play a bit.  Other than that a solid (light) game. :)

I have played this with friends and my 8 year old son, and everyone has enjoyed it. It's a great mix of strategy, suspense and luck of the roll. And even if you get more gold pieces and decimate a foes fleet, they can still win with the luck of having higher gold value total. I have played 4 times and tied once and lost three as of this review, and I had a great deal of fun in each game (I'm pretty competitive so that's saying something).

Arrr, matey, this one's a pleasant miniatures-based combat game with a piratey theme. Setup is longish (drafting fleets, assigning crew, building the map) with lots of players, but if you've got the time to spare, it's still fun. ^_^

RATING: 4
Components rate a '9', but the rules are sketchy at best.  Seems to need further development before it is a decent game.  As it is, it is ok for a quick, luck-laden sea battle.  You spend as much time setting up and picking your fleet as actually playing--not unlike Heroscape.  For whatever reason, I expect more from this game and it doesn't deliver.

RATING: 4.6
A Simple rules, collectible miniatures game. This game is easily adaptable to other modes of play than what is presented in the rules. The ships look great considering they start out as flat plastic cards. The standard game rules are merely ok, and not all that engaging.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I was all ready to be unimpressed by this, but the ships really are charming and the mechanics are fine for the sort of play around on the carpet game I can tolerate.  It's not like I care who wins in this sort of game so balance isn't too much of an issue.

Having said that, playing with one pack each has turned out to be tricky because the packs contained 
a) 2 and 2 masts (commons)
b) 2 and 3 masts (commons)
c) 4 and 5 masts (uncommon and rare)

Hey, just have to get some more I guess.

I usually avoid blind buys, but I picked up a bunch of these on clearance. My experience with another adult was that the joy of assembling the ships far exceeded that of playing the game.

Years later: I've raised my rating considerably after play with kids. This as a minis battle for the Pokémon generation. No kid wants a plodding sailing simulation, anyway. The game has flaws, but it's fun with house rules.

Be warned that some masts are apt to snap when inserted/removed if you're not especially careful. This is frustrating, because masts are removed and added throughout the game.

RATING: 5
I feel that the out of the package setup rules are not clear and do not lead to a very exciting game.  Modifying the setup to use more treasure (both # of coins and total value) should lead to a more exciting game.

[Edit: I'm not a collector, so I don't buy any more boosters.  When we play we tend to draft from everyones collections]

A fun game. Pirate ships are tough to measure distances because there so light. Seemed to move around a lot. Playing without any crew seemes like a lost cause as you will get killed rather quickly.

10/24/15 Played a three-player game using the basic rules in 40 minutes. 
I understand that the advanced game adds several things (crews, captains, other capabilities, etc.), but I can only report on what I played. And I was *very* disappointed. In fact, I stated three minutes into the game it was a forgone conclusion who was going to win merely due to who went first. We could have saved 39 minutes by stopping as soon as "first player" had been randomly determined. I was not interested in playing again, basic or advanced rules. There seemed to be a fatal flaw in the basic game. I assume the advanced game might rectify this, but by that time I had a sour taste in my mouth for this game system, even if it did have beautiful and varied ships.  I suppose I could be talked into playing it again, but I'll never ask for it.   Besides the flaw I've already mentioned, there were some minor ones: some masts had a tendency to keep falling out of their ships due to the slot they went in being too big/loose. Also if you had multiple ships it was sometimes hard to remember which was which without picking them up and looking at the tiny name printed on the side. This was important, since you had to know that to know how they fired and moved.

This game is exactly what it sets out to be.  Quick, easy-to-learn, inexpensive, fun to collect... the game store I work at went through about 6 boxes in the first four days this was out.  It's not long, but it can still be intense, and multiplayer I might add.

I'm sure there's a really good game in there, but this isn't it.

The standard rules leave a lot to be desired.  There are few broadside battles in the game; it's mostly chasing down someone and only rarely getting to shoot.  Also, like any collectible game it can be hard to gather enough cards (or in this case ships) to build an effective fleet without spending a fortune.

A nice minature-type game. The pirate ship cards are very original and the artwork is great! Being able to play the game with only one pack is a bonus as well. Although, I think you'll find you'll want to play with some house rules to make the game really enojoyable and fun. The collectability of this game is another turn off. Enjoyable but I think it wears out it's welcome quickly.

RATING: 8
Certainly not a realistic simulation of age-of-sail combat (wind?  hah!), but captures pirate adventure extremely well.  The decisions you're making are the interesting ones -- you're not managing powder, you're deciding whether to ram and board the Gilded Monkey or run over to that mysterious island in search of booty.  The punched-card mechanism for constructing the ship models works beautifully, although one must be careful not to snap the masts when first assembling the ships.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Demoed it, found it dull. Got talked into a six-player game, found it dull. I don't intend to repeat the experience. Has all the grinding sameness of the old Star Force games without any of the tactics or strategy. Move. Shoot. Take damage. Where's the maneuvering? Where's the wind effects, critical hits, or indeed any impact at all of combat? Take a point, keep on fighting. Take another, keep on. Take another, oops, you sank. Ships that can move 3 or 4 times as fast as other ships for no apparent reason other than "we felt like the Americans needed something faster". 12 point ships that can't survive two rounds of combat with 10 point ships. Two point crew members that contribute nothing to the ship other than an extra damage point every 8-10 combat rolls. Sorry, but this is most definitely not my game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
This game being collectible means the gameplay is fundamentally broken.  The process of figuring out what combinations are better is a puzzle not a game.  Sitting by yourself constructing a team is the definition of solitary play (a puzzle).

Beyond that the business model of collectible games is deplorable.  It is a form of gambling targeted towards children.  It adds no benefit to the gameplay is done specifically to milk as much money from people as possible.

This game seems okay, but not terribly interesting.  If it were not a collectable game, I might give it a 4 or a 5, but I really dislike the whole collectable game genre.  The guy who I played this with did not own enough sets to really have a playable game, and it looks to me like you'd have to spend quite a bit to get enough.  That would be fine, I suppose, but the game just doesn't seem that interesting to me.

RATING: 5
A big Pirates of the Spannish Main fan, I love the minis (even if opening two booster boxes does result in grade A blisters on your thumbs and forefingers from assembling 60 goddamn little ships)!

Shame the game itself is pretty meh, with deep holes in logic, ruling and general play. You could assemble an awesome fleet, but it will be beat by Pirates who have cheaper, faster ships and nick all the treasure before you reach it.

Love the ghostly/monstrous pirate theme of 'The Cursed'. ARGHHH!

I recommend using a pointy tool to lengthen all slots before trying to insert masts for the first time or snapping will most probably happen in your near future!

I'm currently chopping and pasting this game with Dreadfleet. The finished item will be a lovely looking Pirate game that actually plays well. Hopefully!

I'll recommed it for everybody who loves miniature games and don't mind the random factor of collectable card games.

This game is actually a lot of fun, but I'm going to focus on the negative parts. Aside from the collectability issue, it suffers from being "fiddly". The masts can break, it's really hard to measure, and when 1/4" really matters being hard to measure is really annoying. Oh, and a game can be utterly ruined by a gentle breeze or sneeze.

I suspect if the game were played on a hex map and some of the finicky rules tweaked, it would be a helluva lot of fun.

The rules as stated make this more of a race than a battle game. Whoever has fast ships and can outrun their opponents will have an advantage. My friends and I have been working on some house rules to make gameplay more interesting.

Tried using the Wooden Ships and Iron Men lite rules that Scribidnus came up with. They seem pretty good, the game goes quickly, and the uncertainty of when your actions will come up makes the game suspenseful. Need to play more to get a feel for it, but I like it so far.

A crossover of Confrontaton, Magic and Wings of War... but with broken rules! Cards and ships are really nice, as crew's drawing are. However, rules are very very unclear and FAQ and videos on the WizKid website don't help too much. Moreover, measuring ranges from the ship's masts (not mentioning having to remove them!!!) is difficult and chenges the position of the very light ships. Point cost is also very unbalanced. My complete rewriting of the rules, and going back to the original first version which uses a board with squares, raises my score to 8.

I will wait until I play this game once or twice more before I make a rating on this game. Last night was OK. The beginning of the game kind of sucked the end started to get fun.  The problem with this game was the RULES SUCK!!! Not that they are bad rules they just are not clear and leave a lot open.  Not to mention there were 3 different packs of rules all saying noting and what they did say counterdict the other rules. One person spent most of the night on the company's web side reading the FAQ which helped clear a lot up but boy we still have a lot of questions. I want to go see some people who play this game a lot and ask some questions and see how it really players.  I am sure we missed a lot of stuff and did a lot wrong with the way we played but with crappy rules what do you expect.  If I rated this game today I would give it a 2 mainly because it just was not fun. Unfortunetly a lot of the reason is the rules.  Heck if you have 34 page FAQ on your website why don't you try to update some of your rules.

Miniatures gaming doesn't do much for me. Too many issues in movement resolution for anything but solo play if you don't want eyebrows raised at some point.

Nice bits, shame about the rest.

This type of game is much more fun to collect than to play. I might consider playing it with simultaneous moves, or an impulse system or something. I briefly owned "Wooden Ships and Iron Men", and although I sold it due to it's complexity, I would be far more likely to play a naval game with more meat. Also, found the ships fragile, the movement rules odd (how do you really turn?), and the game expensive (like all CCG's).

I have this (several loose packs and a tin box set) and a bunch of the other  sets in this series. They come in packs like CCGs but the cards are plastic and most have push-out pieces that are fitted together to create some quite impressive looking galleons. Each pack also includes some of the smallest dice ever seen with the naked eye. As with similar game collectibles, I am sure that somewhere out there, there is a good naval game that these could be used in.  If anyone finds one, I have several large fleets at your disposal.

I have made up rules for Revolutionary naval campaigns that have proved to be exciting and fun.  Try the rules that come with the game, and then experiment with your own.  It is a lot of fun, and the pieces are nicely made.  But be careful--the card collecting can suck you in quickly!

RATING: 3
Way too expensive for what you are getting. The rules are lacking as if they were never finished. The game looks great but the 'game' portion just fails in several areas: using only 1d6 unbalances the power of small ships, there is a problem with why bother for gold when it is easier to simply sink your opponents ships, there are gaps in the rules - you must make up house rules as the rules included simply do not cover much of what occurs in the game.... It is not complete and though the ships were ready for production, I don't believe the 'game' portion was finished. Look elsewhere.

RATING: 6
It's a cute 2p race game with some building the ships setup that promises a lot more with many crew and ships, but really delivers on only the basic elements of it's own rules in terms of balance, fun, and scalability. Has the most basic problem with a random packs game, of having tons and tons of ships that are not competitive with each other.

This game is a great excuse to collect fun little ships. It's a nice diversion for an ex-Magic player, and it's the only collectible game I have tried since Magic.

I own ships etc. from a number of different editions, so I'm not going to bother listing them all. I don't own anything past the Jade Empire edition.  Would like viking ships and monsters but didn't want to sink too much money into it when the game was in print.

Gotta love simple games!! And this game is extremely simple.  While at first glance it looks flimsy, you quickly realise the stoutness of the ships, and the flexibility of the rules.  These allow for fast impromtu games, and easy of learning for new players!!

RATING: 9
Great game.The ships are good looking and cheap ( you need only a pack to start playing), the only problem is the "luck factor" in placing the gold (if you're lucky and with fast ships , you can win the game in 2-3 turns) but if you play the scenario without gold ( available on the website) it's a blast.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rating is on the whole : as a game, it's probably a 5 due to the bogus rulings that made the game into a treasure race instead of a ship-battle game, but it's probably a 9 from a kids fun approach just taking a couple packs and playing what you got.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I love the little boats and the basic idea of the game, but have been pretty unimpressed with the game overall.  Part of this is that I have zero interest in  fleet design (too many options to figure out), but even when I have played with a "good" fleet designed by somebody who knows the game it seemed like a fairly dull event.

There are a handful of folks in our group who really like this, though, so it hits the table quite a bit.  I may change my opinion when I have played some more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Building things is always fun.

I am primarily a collector, but last night another friend of mine that also collects the ships both bought a single Davy jones pack and played the basic game. It really wasn't that much fun. It was oven in a couple of turns due to some lucky die rolling. We were on fairly equally terms, as both of us got the same ship, the other two ships were similar enough, and we both got a crew to boost attacks. I look forward to be able to play an actual build your own fleet game to make it a more exciting game.

* * * EDIT * * *

I have since started to go to my local game store's weekly pirate night, and have had some good success. Apparently I thrive in a multi-player game, as both of my wins have been in 4P & 5P games.

Another multi-player game and yet another victory. I hope I'm not jinxing myself.

This game kind of introduced me to miniature games. Saw some packs for cheap and it was interesting enough to buy. I got addicted to putting the little boats together that I got a lot! The game itself is weak. The game play is better suited for children and yet a little too complicated for even that. I'm not sure who the target audience was on this game. 12 year olds at best. On top of that you'd have to find another person to play this with. Don't get me wrong, a lot of the mechanics are unique but it just fails to be interesting. I still love the little boats though and like collecting them. Once again I felt Wizkids was trying to make a cross over type game, one that has mass market appeal and yet still is fun for serious gamers but I think it's a long sea to bridge and these ships just wound up sinking (cheese!).

This is a fun game to play and collect but has a few major drawbacks.  First the rules are not well explained or always well thought out.  Secondly without a board the game feels unprecise.

RATING: 5
As a long-time (25+year) wargamer this game should offend me (too simple and cute).  However, as a "wargame" to play with my boys (9&7) it is way too wonderful.

However, as the games continue to roll out I am becoming less enthusiastic.  Each set adds a new ship type but beyond the name little else is different.  Still, a visually appealing collection.

Since I can't rate the individual sets elsewhere, I will do it here:
Pirates of the Spanish Main - Original set. Basic rules.  Fits the treasure race game model well.
Pirates of the Crimson Coast - Never collected
Pirates of the Revolution - Personal favorite because I love the American ships.
Pirates of the Barbary Coast - Added galleys as a ship type.  Interesting, but not nearly enough.
Pirates of the South China Seas - Adds junks as a ship type.  I am interested because I love Asian maritime matters.  However, the small junks prove to be difficult to assemble.  It seems the cuts are a bit tight and the upper deck is difficult for me to fit.  I actually DESTROYED a junk as I was assemblying it (the first time this has ever happened to me).
Pirates: Curse of Davy Jones - The sea monsters are nice to look at but are constrained by the rules...they are just another ship.

Looked cool, so I tried it when it came out, and it's a naval combat game about avoiding naval combat.  Ships have all these destructible parts and detailed combat rules and tiny dice, but your best strategy is to just ignore the other players and make a run for the gold, eschewing interaction.  So much potential, squandered.

I have acquired an insane number of models, 200 ships for use with my modified WS&IM Lite rules which are now posted on the PoSM game page. Since I wasn't collecting crew at first I lucked into some collectors who were giving up large numbers of common ships for small numbers of rare crew chits.  I have my doubts about the game as written but the ships are cool.  Just a modest amount of research by the game artists could have insured a historical color scheme without changing their game one iota and doubled the versatility of the models for us history buffs.

Combat/movement system is prone to arguements for my gaming group. They like more heroscape type movement. Which implies I need a more Warhammer type of gaming group.

RATING: 7
Edit: Upgraded rating after adopting a mix of wind/movement rules from sailing race games Regatta and Race The Wind -- which I think address the weakest link in the Pirates rules (unrealistic ship movement). Rules for both sailing games are available via BGG (or game publisher).

With the wind variant, I find the movement much more meaningful and strategic, while pleasantly unpredictable (due to wind changes). 

Updated rating: 7 (from a 5)

....

Picked up a tin because I really love the Star Wars models and read that Pirates has better game play suitable for miniatures. It does, indeed. But while I love the variety of the SW models and figuring out how to put them together, ship construction in Pirates doesn't change much from one to the next. For me, that is more fun than the game-play.

Wizkids is known for two things: great ideas, and poor rule sets. A CSG (constructable strategy game) that is a game in every booster was a stroke of genius. But, the rules are clunky and beg for nitpicks. And inconsistencies with various expansions made later ships sub-par in many cases. Another game that begs for house rules.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Simple miniatures wargame set in the Age of Sail.  Could use some advanced rules (wind!) and scenarios, the basic "run to an island and grab coins" scenario goes flat quickly.  Really, really cool ships -- fun to assemble, nice looking, great for other games.  The expansions introduced fortresses (or so I've heard, probability mocks me) and latest expansion has ghost ships, undead crew and sea monsters (if you want to add those elements).  Worth a look.

The ships are downright gorgeous.  It is amazing what the end results of the components are with this game.  The fact that you have to remove masts when you are hit seems like one of the biggest scams.  The ships are normally sturdy unless you are constantly fiddling with the masts.  They will invariably break if you keep trying to change the status of your masts.  This adds to the collectibilty aspect of this I guess.

As for the game itself, well it works fine enough, but really nothing special, run to the islands, hope the dice favor you and try to get away with a couple swift moves.  Ramming and boarding almost seem too powerful.  The fact that there are four coins on an island and your ship can hold 5 makes for zero decisions.

I'll keep the ships for something else.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
[Update] I really want to like this game, but I can't.  It seems like it would be so great... and the ships ARE great... but the gameplay is just not there.

I currently own about $100 worth of ships with only a slight intention of buying more.  The game itself is okay, but the built-in movement "slop" always bothers me.

I'm enjoying this game with my wife and friends. The multiplayer version is excellent fun. I'm sure an extensive collection helps in high powered games or at a tournament, but a perfectly fun game can be had by buying a pack or two for each player, opening together, building a fleet, and then playing. Total cost when playing this way becomes less than the snack foods brought to the table.

Why didn't I give this game a 10?
1. Woelf's "Pirate's Code" clears up a lot of the errata and makes the game easier to play. Why did he have to do this? Because the rules are spread out over the small rule sheets for the numerous expansions, and some items are left unexplained alltogether.

2. While a very fun idea that allows you to remove parts from the ships as they take damage, the styrene sheet design of the entire game makes it fragile. Occasionally you actually do destroy a ship, and that makes you sad.

3. Care must be taken by players with long fingernails, as the printing can be scratched off.

4. and the only thing that isn't easy to overlook: This game is dead. You will have to scrounge to find it, and there doesn't look to be more coming. (Thank you Topps... booooo)

If you're careful with your stuff, and you use the updated/consolidated rules you'll have grand fun. If you avoid either of these suggestions, you'll break the game mechanic and the game pieces as well.

It's hard to rate this one.  As a game, it's merely so-so.  But the ships... the ships... Oh, the ships!  The ships are fantastic, and well worth the purchase price alone.  It's just too bad that playing the game more than once really requires one to either come up with tons of house rules, or use many that can be found online.  Still, it gets play, and I love my fleet with or without the game.  Vive la France!

Edit: haven't played in a loooong time now, and I'm trying to free up some space... so, to the trading block it goes.  I've got hundreds of ships in the English, French, Spanish, and Pirate factions, and a handful of American ships.  Some promos and unopened tourney packs too.

I sank far too much money into this game to not play it every so often. I suspect many other people have as well. Prepare yourself and your friends for a night of house-ruling and minutia-arguing.

Passably fun.  Not much to it and the collectible concept drops a point right from the start--the game is extremely unbalanced depending on what people might pull from their packs.  No wind, no decrease in movement for losing masts (decrease in firepower instead).

Like the line from the movie Jerry Maguire, "I love Pirates of the Spanish Main for the game it *almost* is".

A simple game for kids without a whole lot of depth.  If you bought the packs at full retail, you paid a ton of dough to be ultimately disappointed  for your trouble.

At the same time, if there was a way to harness the depth of strategic choices offered by all of these great ships in a coherent game that made sense, you could have one of the best and most attractive games ever set in the Age of Sail.

I'm a sucker for naval stuff. I will find a way to make this game better.

How WizKids can take a great pirate theme, along with a novel production concept, and turn it into something that is so devoid of flavor and fun is a mystery. Thanks to the kindergarten rules, this product was a standing joke at my local hobby shop.

Have many extra ships, crew, etc. for trade from all sets.

Have been collecting all expansions since November 2006. NOTE to self: That was the fateful Thanksgiving weekend when I bought my first pack of a collectible game (actually two packs). I looked online to find out why the basic rules were lame (get treasure back to home port, no real need for fighting, person who goes first wins) and then got hooked on reading the Wizkids forums and got hooked on collecting the neato ships.  Yes, I agree the earlier sets are better than the newer and more divergent sets so my obsession is waning (thankfully). :-/

Built the ships, read the rules and had one game.

Aug 2006 update - DS age 7 has rediscovered this collectible game and is using all his pocket money to buy more. We have the UK map from the packets I bought over there last year and I have had it laminated. It works well for a younger child as using the card to measure as in the USA version tends to lead to movement error and knocking over ships.

The ships ROCK, The game SUCKS.  I've got a pretty large collection of the ships and found their marketing/punchcard components to be brilliant.  Granted I only have played one game of this but I disliked it so much I wouldn't be inclined to try another.

Seems very fiddly in setup compared to the actual gameplay involved. Still requires some small thought in play, but I feel like a lot of the enjoyment seems to come from owning your own fleet and watching it in action (as, I'm beginning to find, is the case with quite a few collectable mini games). And this thing's out of print...

Overall, I think that this is a pretty good game for what it is.  I sponsor the game club at the school I teach at and I've used PotSM now a couple of times to introduce new kids who show up to find out what goes on gaming.  It is certainly not the be-all and end-all of collectable gaming, but it's pretty good for what it is.  Just don't approach it with any huge expectations of an in-depth game.  It's been such a good game for kids that I occasionally see it being played at the lunch tables.  It's good for some quick, non-complex fun.

The Pirates CSG has a ton of potential. The rules are simple, the theme is fun, and the art is spectacular. Unfortunately, I don't feel that Wizkids has used the potential the game has effectively. Purchasing new cards does not add much in the way of new gameplay choices, it merely gives you a lot more of what you already have. If you are interested in the Pirates CSG, I'd suggest limiting yourself to one or two sets of cards. 

My favorites sets are Pirates of the Spanish Main, Pirates of the Crimson Coast, Pirates of the Revolution, and Pirates At The Ocean's Edge.

Don't be deceived by the low average score. This game is fun. It is a great collectible game with cool pieces and characters.

I prefer the first 3 seasons, and maybe the 4th. After that, it went a bit downhill.

The element that draws me most is the theme. The game is rich with imagery and flavor text related to the age of sail. The character art is very effective in conveying the mood and story of the game.

Really lovely little bits, but completely fails as a game. Shoot at the other ship or just grab for the gold. If you try the former, you lose the game.

This game as a real big 'neat' factor. Assembling the ships may be the most fun part of the game. Actual game play is simple, almost too simple really, and every thing you need to play is included in a single booster pack.

Best with house rules or making up senarios. Best friend and I separated all our ships into factions. You played the faction, usually with cost limit rather than gold. Senarios are also fun. Have Viking ships try to go through a pass full of pirates, or "capture the flag" with forts and flotilas. Spent way too much on packs from various releases...but we had a ton of fun.

Pirates At Ocean's Edge Collectible storage tin edition (2007). I'm looking for the sea monsters, 'Giant Crab and Shark', and whatever else.. none came in my copy. think I have an extra ship to trade.

Boy, for such a 'shitty' game, people sure do soak a ton of money into it.. judging from the gallery pics. :D

Cool little constructable ships.  My son loves to play with them.  For awhile there we were using them to play shoot-'em-up-pirates at least once a week.  I've never played the actual game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very fun to play. Only problems are some ambiguous rules (especially movement), long setup time, and the goal of obtaining the most Treasure seems a bit....ungratifying.  

That's why you have fleet-on-fleet engagements, or play so that treasure buys you ships and crew, and play to last man standing.

This extinct collectible game comes as cards with plastic pieces you punch out to create model ships. You create a fleet of ships that work well together and take to the seas and islands laid out on the tabletop in an amazingly fun high-seas battle and treasure hoarding game.

I really like the miniatures and most of the way it plays, but there are some things that I'm not a fan of, i.e. firing cannons at almost 90*.  No worries, though, as I'm redoing the rules much like WS&IM Lite, but a bit different.  I'm incorporating rules and ideas from other games and real life.
But, the original PotSM/CC/R/BC is pretty good.

It does work for what it is, and there's a tremendous toy factor here.  But...for a CCG, the gameplay isn't terribly intricate or immersive.  It has no angst whatsoever, and certainly no sense of sailing (there are no wind rules, ferchrissakes).  I don't mind the simplicity, but I need a hook, something really inventive or compelling, and this just doesn't have it. (Other than the really, really clever ships, of course.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Nice ships - like a lot of people even though the game didnt impress me I will probably buy more to use for other pirate games, or a heavily modified version of the official game. 

I found the game too simple and didn't really evoke the genre very well. A ship game should at least take account of the wind. I think this could be added to the rules without breaking it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
So far so good. Love the ships, like the game.  Will definitely play this any chance I get.  It is fun to make theme fleets, chase down your opponent and shoot the crap out of them whether or not you win.  The game stores well, travels well, and looks beautiful.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
When it was first released, I was hooked immediatly. I just love the theme, I love putting the ships together and you have to have a pretty tactical mind ... but ... those dice, those freaking dice! More then once the die result makes or breakes a plan and sometimes that result overpowered the gameplay. And because I often lost due to that and our playgroup fel apart, I lost my interest. One friend however stalks me on a weekly bases to play it more often. So once in a while I dive into my collection and give it another go.

RATING: 6.9
I finally bought a few packs to use the ships with other games (Plunder and Enemy in sight) and discovered that this is a pretty simple and fun game.  For what it is, it's great.  Naval warfare in the age of sail without wind.  I guess it's much like their flying game Crimson Skies that doesn't use altitude.  Too bad it's collectible.  Maybe they'll eventually release a historic set that's not. (Yeah right, like that's going to happen.)

Picked up a crapload of stuff in a BGG auction with 800 unique units from the later sets.  Combined with all the ones I have from the first few sets, I've got an impressive collection with which to sail the Spanish Main.

RATING: 4
The game play is laughable but the models are great. Why hadn't anyone thought of this wonderful idea? To be honest, I only buy them for the ships. I plan on playing Wooden Ships & Iron Men with them. And by the way, I *did* try out the game before rating it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The gameplay is simple as can get (though there are some fanmade optional rules for more realism) and the models look decent (though they tend to break during assemblage). This can be a great entry point into the Age of Sail types of games - especially into Sails of Glory.
Over the holidays we had now the first games with our son (aged 5) and we had a blast. Building the models is great fun and he enjoys racing for the treasures. Currnetly he is less fond of attacking, so we emphasize the treasure hunt (and leave out all special abilities). I am sure he will grow with this game and one by one the more complex rules can be added. Great experience, especially with kids.

A very interesting and unique experience which is definitely fun if not perfectly balanced.  Given Wizkids record of "correcting" rules problems after the release, I think this game will eventually be fantastic.  At the moment though it does have some rule problems that will hurt it.

This is a thrifted collection of 84 ships, about 10 miscellaneous creatures and a couple of castles. There are four tins here - two are the smaller type and two are larger expansions labeled "At Ocean's Edge." Three of the tins are filled with assembled ships, etc. and one of the smaller tins is full of cards for ships, crew, etc. I am not a player of this game, so I have no idea what all is here.

Great quality visual game with little mechanic-wise to back it up.  I have played this twice and probably will not play again.  Measuring the distances alone is enough to start a brawl over when I play.

Clever collectable ship game from WizKids. Being able to punch the ships out of a credit card sized sheet and clip them together and put them away into the card again is great. Unfortunately the gameplay is only average.

In Pirates of the Spanish Main, players make fleets of ships to sail to different islands looking for treasure. This booty is obtained in one of two ways: commanding your salty dogs to dig it out of the ground or sending your opponent's ships to Davy Jones%u2019 locker! Damage is tracked by removing sails from the ships.

I am not a fan of miniature games eventhough I love miniatures in my board games (yeap crazy guy) yet this pirate game got us 'hooked' for a while. We bought a bunch of boosters from ebay and we play from time to time. It's a great strategic game (yet we love to fight in the middle of the table with the entire fleet about 5 minutes from the start). It's really enjoyable to build the ships and they are made of a resistant plastic. Once built they look like painted miniatures and they are so cool. It will surely give you hours of fan even for the non pirates fans.

Still my favourite CCG.  I mean, there's the lego aspect of building the ships, and there's pirates, and real strategy and interesting choices.  All together, a pretty awesome little game, and I need to pick up the Jade rebellion ships.

I love this game far more than it probably deserves.  It  has its share of problems, but with a few minor house rule tweaks here and there it becomes exceptionally fun.

I love these little miniature ships!  The components are unique and excessively thematic.  I especially enjoy constructing the different ships and watching them come to life!  The concept behind their production is very unique.

As far as game play, it is rather mediocre on all accounts.  Also, it is important to point out that the masts will break with normal wear and tear.

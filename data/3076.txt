RATING: 6
A great game, with clever and well crafted mechanics, but I'm afraid it's not my cup of tea. 
The role selection model is simple and functional, reducing downtime and overall playing time. It also helps beginners in learning the game, with each player going through each selected phase every turn, an useful bonus for a game that doesn't lack its complexities: from the specific rules of each role to the proper understanding of the various buildings. 
On the long run the gameplay seems to rarely diverge from a limited number of optimum strategies, also being, quite often, really sensitive to the number of players and their skill level. Interaction is limited to selecting roles and buildings that can advantage you more than your opponents and not selecting the ones that do the opposite, but, to me, it still feels like a multiplayer optimization rush with almost no direct interplay and little space for errors. 
Still, a really good piece of work per se.

Rio Grande version. Simple but solid and functional components. Not really impressed by the text-only building tiles: function over form, I suppose, but even a small illustration could have been the final touch (the San Juan based alternative, here on the Geek, is a good example). Really good rulebook. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
It seems overwhelming at first, but it's really not that hard of a game to understand.  Even though you have to read and reread the buildings to determine how they are used in the game, I give Puerto Rico  a "ten". 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Fantastic supply management game, superbly balanced, with every game very different.  Also the 3, 4 and 5 player games play significantly differently.  Extremely well designed.

Update:  Not sure if I've read too many negative comments about this game on BGG, but when I played it last night I didn't seem to enjoy it as much as usual.  I'll downgrade it from 10 to 9.

Played this week and still love it.  A 10.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very elegant design and highly enjoyable game but not quite the gaming nirvana some would have you believe. Only one game with the expansion buildings and whilst the game doesn't really need any new life breathing into it, we pretty much went through a new learning curve.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The first time I tried this I thought: That's it? I much prefer the different choices the cards in Agricola have to offer, vers. the few buildings you can build in Puerto Rico.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Variable Phase Selection, fast play, low downtime, (generally) playing against players (not the game, although it is through indirect mechanical interaction more than anything else), and a long supply chain really amount to a decent game overall. The greatest coup was getting my parents to play game after game after game. Two downsides are that you either need more buildings, or content to deal with your existing options as it's a static setup. Second, it is the namesake of the problem that many other "seat-order dependency" games suffer from where it's the responsibility of the person next to you to keep you in check more so than players across the table. Really fiddly in my experience, although I suppose some of that can be reduced. I loathe the instruction manual. I understand why this is considered Seyfarth's star accomplishment.

Update; This is a game that I find I enjoy best when I binge and I think that's because of the setup time. For some reason the second and third game generally make me happier than the first one of an evening, so it rarely comes out anymore. It's a game that I love playing it with a select group of people (my parents at holidays), but that's it.

This game is enjoyable. IMO, better than CATAN. Every player has roughly the same amount of chance to win from the get-go. In addition, the game corrects itself by buffing roles that aren't picked as often over the course of the game. Unfortunately, I am less than willing to play this with a new group of people, which in the end detracts from the review.

Like this needs to be pushed up the ladder. I had avoided this for a while fearing that it would lean towards the person with the most experience. But now after playing 30 or so games, this is well deserved rated so high on the BBG. Absolutely fantastic game!

RATING: 7.5
I remember the first time I was introduced to this game... I wanted to rip my eyeballs out. Of course, this was back in the dark ages when I was just getting introduced into these newfangled board games, and I'll admit I was a bit overwhelmed. How far we have come... I tried it again a few months later and it quickly became a favorite of my wife and I. And now we barely play it. The life cycle of games...

Still, a great game, and a classic. Of all the "gateway games" we own (Ticket to Ride, Settlers, Carc, Dominion) this is the one I like the best.

RATING: 8
The big one. Puerto Rico. I feel I have barely scratched the surface of this game. The mechanics work all too well - you really feel poor and desperate at the start of the game, by the middle you are frantically trying to decide what everyone will do and whose set up is the most threatening and then at the end there is a tremendous sense of time running away from you. A great game. BUT. It seems that to sit after a weaker player (normally me) gives a very big advantage and so to get a satisfactory game everyone must be of a simialr standard.

Highly strategic, innovative, interactive game that is relatively easy to play.  The role selection mechanic, where it feels like it's your turn every turn, and where each role can be very strong or very weak depending on the game or the timing of its selection within a game, might be the best game mechanic I've ever experienced.  One of the most popular games in my group, and probably still the best game I've ever played.

Own the [boardgame=12382]Extra buildings[/boardgame] and the [boardgame=159761]Nobles[/boardgame] mini-expansions from the [boardgame=40688]Treasure Chest[/boardgame] as well as the [boardgame=108687]Limited Anniversary Edition[/boardgame] which contains both of the above mini-expansions as well.

This game has a problem similar to Dominion in that people who have played this game often have a distinct advantage over people who have not played as much. Every time I have played this game, it has been with people who have played the game 10x+ my play experience so I get crushed in actual score.

That being said, the game is still enjoyable. It is engine building and there are very many valid ways to build an engine and claim victory.

Pros: plays fairly quickly; simple mechanics; tricky short-term vs. long-term strategies; decent components (though you can't read the buildings' text without picking them up or referring to a cheat sheet).

Cons: so-so theme (Plantation owner???); small player interaction (with some auto-play turns and lots of dependence on other player's role choices); somewhat unforgiving of play mistakes (especially early on). No dice rolling.

Conclusion: it's a successful game because it works as printed. The game does get fairly heavy in the late stages and some players will have brain lock-up (yours truly) over a crucial decision (followed by brain fatigue after the game). It's not a game that I would seek out to play (like in tournaments) but if others clamored to play it, I'd reluctantly join in.

150814 Its just a brilliant 2P game.  I've tried almost all the different rulesets and it just works great every which way.  Back up to 8.

130929 I also hate the negotiation/influencing aspect of it.  Maybe with a less chatty group of players I'll enjoy it again.  It its fine mechanically just some of the culture around the game makes it tough to play.

120910 Just ok, main problem is everyone is skilled and fast at the game.  I do not enjoy playing the game this way because I'm not familiar enough with it.  If I get better it may rise back up.

100819 Need to play more.  With the fernori variant (which modifies the official alea 2P variant) its a great 2P game.

A lot of choices and strategy here, which is usually a good thing. Unfortunately, I find theme thin and uninteresting and some the mechanics needlessly obtuse and arbitrary. I guess you have to play it several times before you "get" the strategy, but there wasn't much there to interest me. If the strategy isn't intuitive or if I can't figure out what to do after a game, there has to be *something* inherently fun or interesting about the game for me to want to play it again. It's not inherently fun or interesting to me though. Maybe it was partly because of the theme, but I found Ingenious and Qwirkle more engaging and interesting that this game so it wasn't just the dry theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

One of the best. I like how there are several paths to victory in this game, and choosing roles each round is a great mechanic. The official two-player variant from Alea also plays very well.

I find this dry, asocial and downright dull. One of few games I'd rather sit out on than play. I know many hold this game in high regard, and I've played it eight times to give it a fair change.

This appears to be one of those games you either love or hate.  I'm sorry, I'm probably swimming upstream, but in the 4-5 times I've played it, I have formed an extremely negative opinion of the game.  The Turn order always messes me up.  The guy in front of me invariably takes what will screw me over or what I need the most.  I just don't get the strategy or the appeal of the game.  You could not pay me to play it.

Then there are all of the "unofficial" expansions that people are printing out and tossing into the mix that makes it even worse.

After trying to play a few more times my opinion has not changed.. in fact, I hate it more than ever.

Is it the best game ever as indicated by it's #1 rating on BGG?  Probably not, but that doesn't mean that this isn't a fun game to play.  As others have stated, there are, at times, "wrong" moves that can frustrate experienced players.  However, as long as you stay light hearted and remember that it's just a game, you can't go wrong with Puerto Rico.

Six years later and PR is still a fun experience.  I don't play it nearly as often, but when I do, I always appreciate the beauty of this game.  If played with my favorite group, this one is a 10.  With a random group, probably a 7.  I figure this averages to 8.5.

First play tentative rating. I see why this game is a classic. It's an elegant game of perfect information. It's easy to learn, hard to win. Although this is definitely a euro, you need to be extremely aware of the people around you and they can greatly impact your ability to win. Even though the game seems simple enough conceptually, the strategy can be quite complex. I have a feeling that on replay, I may move this game up to a 10. It's just such a pleasing game: you build, you plant, you deliver... and then there is a frantic rush toward the end as you desperately try to get those last points. If I have one complaint it's just how dull the art looks. If there was an art update, it would be perfect.

To me, this game is sort of a "multiplayer chess"... It can be too scripted, and if you play against really good opponents, you're sure to get your ass kicked with less gaming satisfaction then if you lost other eurogames.


I much prefer Race For The Galaxy, especially with expansions, but I can definitely see why this game's rated highly overall here on BGG.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
PR is really a very good economic game!! not very complicated game rules (may need 2-3 games to know the building functions). Each turn, you just need to chose a role (out of 6 to 8), and take the action with the chosen role, huh! is it simple? not really!! since the role you chosen may affect other players, so to make a decision in mid game is quite brain-teasing!! You need to manage money and victory point in terms of building, manpower, resources. 

Moderate game time, PR usually can be finished within 20 turns. You can play it in casual way as exploring the game with your land development. Great design. San Juan (card game) is recommended as well ( I have played SJ first such that I know PR easily)

RATING: 7
The quality of this game is heavily dependent on the players of a given session - because there is no randomness (aside from the players' decisions) and no hidden information of real consequence, the only risk you take is in underanalyzing your move, which can make play a little sterile. Also, if a weak player is to a strong player's right, it can completely unbalance the game. Despite that, this is an interesting, well-crafted game that is quite enjoyable if played by people of equal skill level. Do yourself a favor and avoid strategies for this game; part of the fun is feeling out what works for yourself.

After one play, I hardly feel I have scratched the surface of this game. It is clearly deep, involved, rich, and very strategic. I have some knowledge of the lighter card-game San Juan, so it came fairly naturally to me, but it is a complex affair. I was surprised to find it wasn't a long game, even with five players. It certainly didn't outstay its welcome. The only significant criticism for me is the appearance of it. The theme is dry and the board/tokens reflect this. It's all text, very little imagery and rather boring to look at. Compared to the lovely artwork in Agricola (a game of similar weight) it looks a little tired. But I was glad to find that in my first play of Puerto Rico, it lived up to the hype.

2 plays / 5 players.

LIKE: Quite competitive with 5, but in a fun way. Lots of interesting combos to explore.

DISLIKE: Some very strong player order binding that can be beneficial or hindering. The game plays strongly to those who've played before and know some combos, so first-time players will sometimes struggle their first time through.

OVERALL: The first time I played it, I could tell I liked it. The combos were great, but the game is really about timing and trying to maximize the role you choose.

What more is there to say about Puerto Rico?  One of my favourites and a landmark in board game design.  After many plays, I see myself always wanting to play this more.  

I love the balance of tactical considerations with long term strategies.  You also need to pay careful attention to what your opponents are doing.  This is one of the most subtle, rewarding and enjoyable games I've ever played.

Also, I just got both expansions for $15 on Craigslist!

But if you are looking for something more advanced than Settlers this is definitively a game to look at.

This is to board games what Bridge is to card games: It's the pinnacle. The design is intensely elegant and smart. Plays well (if a bit different) with 3, 4 or 5. One thing I will say is if you're experienced and playing with inexperienced, the game falls flat. You need equal competitors to garner enjoyment. However, it appears that it will always remain a classic with me.

Totally overrated. I don't like the looks and the feeling of the building chits. They ruin the experience. The mechanics is great but the game is too long and it is weak on theme. Surprisingly, after all this whining, I wont turn down a game.

Puerto Rico is a classic Euro game, and between the deep strategy and near complete absence of luck, it lives up to the hype.  Some complain that new players can "play wrong" by taking suboptimal roles, but I feel like this is just a part of the strategy of the game.  You can't expect the other players to do what's best for you (or even for themselves).

+Deep strategy.
+Multiple paths to victory.
+Introduced (or at least popularized) the role selection mechanism.
+Little down time.

-Steep learning curve.
-With all buildings available every game, games could potentially end up playing out similarly, but I think there are so many options, this is a very small concern.
-Calling the brown worker tokens "colonists" whitewashes the issue of slavery in the game's theme.

I like the strategy part of this game. There is very little 'chance' element as players themselves choose the events of the turns. This ensures that each game has a different feel and that there are more than one way to win. - UPDATE: Those "more than one way to win" paths are actually pretty fixed, as there are a certain number of strategies that has been categorized as "the right ones" by people who have played this game a lot. This limits the fun for me.

RATING: 9.4
This game is best when played with exactly four players, and with the inclusion of two key tournament rule variations:  first, the players starting with corn start the game with one fewer doubloon, and second, the costs of building the university and factory are switched (university now costs 7, factory costs 8).  

The tightness and balance of the tournament-variant four-player game is a thing of beauty, particularly among four similarly-skilled players.  If there is a newbie with three other more advanced players, then... well, let me just say it is generally best to find yourself seated to immediately follow the newbie's play (a newbie rarely seems to appreciate the best and worst moments to select the Craftsman, for instance, so the player immediately following the newbie gets the benefit of continually having first go at the market or the ships following production).

I don't particularly like this with three given the omission of the Prospector role (which has the benefit not only of money, but of also being the only role that doesn't grant other players a benefit--sometimes a key play).  At 5 it is certainly playable, but the higher money count to start the game and the influx of even more money via two prospectors makes the price of the buildings not exactly at scale (the first player to build on the first turn can select a tobacco storage or a large market, for example).  

I still find this to be an enjoyable design after 15 years--though maybe part of it is nostalgia since this was the game I credit with really getting me back into board gaming.

Highly strategic game that plays equally well with 2 to 5 players within an hour.  

Many tactical touchy decisions to make.

The fact that everyone is allowed to do the action the active play selected is very clever and brings something unique to the game.

A true masterpiece!

Would rate it a 10 if component quality was slightly better than the current "print-and-play" level.

A game of Puerto Rico is a bit like a date that went ... okay. It was nice. It was a nice place, food was good, we had a nice talk. Interesting. Everything was ... fine. Sevenoutoften, would date again. Call me. Maybe.

Puerto Rico is an old classic, which means it has well-balanced dynamics, a wide variety of possible strategies, it is typically ... fun ... to play. But again and again, I find myself playing it with new players, who (understandably) fall back to the usual strategy of producing lots of stuff and shipping it for victory points (even winning the game with it), which gets boring in the end. Obviously, one could play it against a group of more experienced players, but then again ... there are so many more interesting fishes in the sea. Let's have coffee sometime?

One of my favourite board games. First of all it is quite easy to learn the basics, which is perfect for new players. Another big bonus, which is beneficial both for newcomers and veterans is the short playtime. The reason for this is of course that shorter games tend to be played a lot more than longer ones. 

The game also offer a lot of tactics, which include indirect interaction with other players. I don't mind that the interaction is not direct in this game, since most of your moves affect the other players in some way. This is a game that will always be a part of my collection.

This is a great game for almost any group and is our family's favorite - beating out Settlers of Catan.  It is challenging for adults and hard core gamers, yet children (not real young) can play.  We played recently and my 7 year old son won and we didn't let him either.  I couldn't believe it!  It also plays shorter (or at least seems to) than indicated on the box.  The main thing is when the game is over ALL of us wish it would've lasted longer - this game never drags on.  Something I can't honestly say about any other game.  An added benefit is the price.  Compared to other games and what you get with this - tons of bits, this is the best value around.

Quizá sus componentes no están a la altura de los estándares actuales, pero sigue siendo bonito ver cómo tu isla crece y se convierte en un pequeño mundo lleno de trabajadores, edificios y campos... También es uno de los juegos mejor equilibrados de todos los "Euros duros", con muchas estrategias y formas diferentes de desarrollar tu isla.
Sin embargo, y a causa de la mecánica de roles, cuando juegan jugadores experimentados con un novato éste puede desequilibrar el juego entregando la victoria al jugador sentado a su lado.

On the bad side, when playing with an unexperienced player he can totally unbalance the game giving victory to the player sitting next to him...

RATING: 10
A worthy game for the innovative turn-sequence system alone - and there's more.  The game also combines the "multiple paths to victory" as in Princes of Florence, and the "break normal game rules" aspect of some CCGs (or Cosmic Encounter, Ursuppe/Urland etc.) in the form of purple building functions.  (And yes, the buildings can be very powerful.)  And yet the balance between the various game elements (building costs etc.) seems to be just right, so that there is no single obvious winning strategy (at least it seems so) nor elements which become useless because they're too weak.  A most excellent, finely-crafted game.  Perhaps the best of 2002, my bet for DSP winner.

RATING: 7
I played this game just three times, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

I wasn't really impressed by Puerto Rico after the first couple of plays, but I enjoyed it a lot better the third time. I like the fact that the game flows so smooth and easily. The action selection mechanism is simple, but really clever and deep enough to grant an interesting game-play that keeps everybody at the table engaged the whole time. These are all characteristics of a very good design. On the other hand I can't say that I enjoy Puerto Rico so much that I wish to own it. 

The first reason is the visual impact of the game and the component quality. I played two editions so far and both of them have this really thin cheap cardboard and kinda poor artwork. Everything feels very bland... which it's surprising. You think that a game as popular as this one would have gotten a nicer edition. The second thing that lowers my enjoyment of the game is the limited amount of strategies that it offers. The game is always the same every time you set it up. That's similar to Caverna, which is a game I love, but here there's only a very small amount of buildings and some of them are clearly stronger than the others. They don't allow enough variety to make me want to go back to the game and explore it more.

At the end I think that Puerto Rico is a good game and an example of simple and yet deep design. On the other hand I think it shows its age a little too much and nowadays there's similar games on the market that do the same thing better. Still enjoyable though!

It's a good game, luckless, in which you try to build plantations and other buildings in order to gather as many VPs as possible.
What I like about it:
- that you cannot trade the same goods as before (at least until the trading house is emptied)
- that you must fill the boats in order to ship the goods, which creates some nice strategies
What I didn't like:
- it's bland....let's say tasteless... although much better and more complex than San Juan, I still prefer RftG

A rather complex game set in colonial Puerto Rico involving the production, trade, and shipment of corn, indigo, tobacco, and coffee. Very strong strategy component (which explains its Board Game Geek rating), similar to San Juan. Check out the Board Games with Scott review for a great rules refresher. 

An "official" two-player rule set is linked from the Puerto Rico files area on BGG.

We own the expansions for the game that are included in the Treasure Chest. They are in the box.

Recommended with 2-5 players (best 4). 90-150 mins.

Still the greatest boardgame ever, after 7 years.
I have played over 700 times. 
Incredibly deep, you can play 50 or 100 times and still not fully comprehend this game.
Incredibly well balanced, almost no luck involved, the outcome is determined almost entirely by player interactions/decisions.  'Luck' occurs in the form of player chaos / player role selections which could hurt or help you.
The game doesnt even take the 90 mins stated on the box, once players become familiar with it, it takes about 45-75 mis, depending on #players.  (Played online, this goes to 20-30 minutes for 3 player, 30-45 for 4 player, 45 to 60 for 5 player.)
I cannot recommend this game enough, it is absolutely amazing. It is the most perfect boardgame I have ever played.

This game seems right up my alley, but setup is a bit fiddly to me compared to Race for the Galaxy, which is the game I own and love playing.

Both games are obviously not identical, but close enough that I only own RFTG, and nobody ever brings PR, so I can't play it more.

Personally, it is a great game (vote 9) but it is more stressing than fun (vote 6). Never exciting, almost boring. I don't like games when soon or later there is an obvious better move to do. I'll never refuse to play it but won't push the group to play it anymore.

RATING: 8.5
A good game that has no luck involved in the game.  Players can win with employing different strategies.  Player with the most victory points wins the game.

Good points: Quite easy to play once you get the hang of the game.  By choosing different characters, players have different advantages during each round of the game.

Bad points: There is hardly any bad points about the game.  

If compared to Caylus, I think Caylus has slightly more dimension than Puerto Rico.  It is important to both have money (to place workers) and resources (to build buildings and castle) in Caylus but in Puerto Rico, there is only money which is important for buying buildings.  The resources of Puerto Rico can be the various types of plantations but it can be taken for free, but the building resources of Caylus has to be harvested with placing of workers.  With royal favours in Caylus, it also adds more strategy into the game.  In all both are good games, but I think Caylus is slightly better than Puerto Rico.

RATING: 8
Dropped from a 9 based on a few minor factors (player order issues and a semi-scripted game start the most notable). That said, this is a game that deserves its high ranking here - thematically richer than many of its brethren, strong player game engine development, and a great length-of-game makes this a favorite!

RATING: 7
In my experience it's pretty rare to find combo-driven game where all the pieces are so well balanced against each other. That alone deserves a high rating.

It's also good with multiple player counts and doesn't take too long to play so it gets thrown in the bag when arrangements are uncertain. The reasonably sized box helps for that, too.

My favorite thing about Puerto Rico is the dance around who is going to take Craftsman. I wouldn't mind finding a game with the same tension but without the engine building.

Update: lowered to a 7 due to the engine building. It can be quite a bit of fiddling just to arrive at the meatier decisions. It's still good, but looking at my other eights I like them much more.

each turn you select one role, and use the benefits associated with that role. Problem is, everyone else gets to take that action as well - so make sure you are not helping them more than you help yourself. Also notable for best euphemism in my games collection (it describes the workers delivered to you as "colonists" when you know full well they're slaves). It deserves its reputation and has seen many plays from me.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I love some of the game mechanics behind PR, especially the role cards (and the monetary incentive to pick a card unused in the previous round). 

However, I find PR to dull, dry, and boring. It's too mechanical: build a plantation, build a matching production building, place colonists on the plantation and production buildings, produce a good, and then ship goods for victory points but only if the ship is free. There are other things you can do to get money, increase production, etc., but overall, the whole process is not fun.

My other criticism is that at half-way through the game, it's pretty clear who will be the winner. You can see the strategy play out and guess which roles will be selected. If you are collecting more points and/or money half-way through the game for a particular role, then there is not much that can be done for others to catch up and pass you when that role is selected. 

*** UPDATE 1: I played PR again with 3 other gamers for the first time as an experienced euro-gamer. I had a much more positive gaming experience - the game wasn't as dull as I remembered it. Now that we all understood how euro-games work in general, we all picked up on the different strategies for winning. ***

*** UPDATE 2: Meh, only mildly interested in ever playing this again. ***

Played Puerto Rico several times before I started tracking my games played (approx. 5-8 times).

Me da la impresión de no tener demasiada variadad de estrategias para ganar, aunque habrá que jugarlo más para opinar con propiedad. La mecánica de los barcos me gustó mucho y añade algo de intereacción entre los jugadores, obligandose entre sí a "despachar" determiando tipo de productos. Un juego de 8, de momento.

Puerto Rico was the third game I bought. I had only played El Grande and Settlers of Catan beore buying this game. Both of the previous games were taught to me so I did not have any experience making my way through a rule book. The fact that this game breaks down the common notion of what a game 'turn' is didn't help either.

Needless to say this game went unplayed for a long time until I found some one who was willing to teach the game to me and my game group. After being taught the game all I thought about was Puerto Rico. Having played Race for the Galaxy before hand helped me pick up on many of the more subtle complexities of this game as well. Truly a classic and one that I will be playing for a long time to come.

Great game! I bought it because it was no. 1 on the Geek at the time, and I'm very glad I did. Everyone I've introduced it to has liked it, and so far no one has tired of it. I am an Ameritrasher/light wargamer at heart, so the best of Euros is going to seem a little dry and cold to me, which is why PR is only an 8. Given the choice, I'd usually rather play WotR, or C & C: Ancients if I don't have time for WotR. But even if I could play wargames as much as I liked, I'd still want to cleanse my palate with PR on occasion.

A fantastic game with one of the early role-selection mechanics that remains interesting.  Planning around the turn order cycle is challenging, as this is a game where you are definitely not going to be able to do everything you want to accomplish in a turn.  The economics are fairly simple, but that cycle is what makes the game so interesting.  I wish more people in my play group were into this, because I think this has the potential to be a very competitive game once everyone has had a few sessions to figure out their preferred strategy.  Sadly, the set up time keeps this off the table more than is fair.

Puerto Rico feels like clockwork. It's a classic. It has an incredibly clean, smooth design. I would recommend it to anyone interested in trying out the whole 'Euro game' thing who doesn't mind if the game's theme is a little dry and detached. Puerto Rico has a soul, but it's not very thematic.

My issue with PR these days is that the base game is just kind of played out for me. The options are pretty obvious and I feel like I'm sort of just going through the motions.

I like to add the expansion bits to spice things up. But it doesn't seem to happen very often when PR hits the table!

Theoretically, this is a timeless classic. I enjoyed it but I felt like newer games do a similar thing better. I played Glen More before I played this one, and it was like I was playing Glen More while taking more table space and, by playing sub-optimally, enabling the person to my left to do better than everyone else. I enjoyed it, but I'd buy Glen More just because it's more compact, feels the same, and doesn't have the same balance issue.

For something that takes up a similar amount of table space, I would want to play Viticulture or Vanuatu - something which has a little more flavor and complexity, to earn the real estate it's costing.

Snooze-fest. Also doesn't help that it's essentially "solved" in what the most optimal moves are. I don't enjoy the fact that not selecting the only optimal move all but ensures your loss. Where's the variety?

This is a solid design that scales very well and offers all players the freedom to, generally, do what they want. The buildings really allow players to define their game and while there can indeed be kingmaking and the like, I think this effect is exaggerated, especially if you alert new players as to the interactions and risks of certain actions.

This is indeed a game where you have to be keenly aware of other players' statuses and play to that.

---------------------------------------------------

The 2p variant is good, and quite a bit deeper than San Juan. Multiplayer it's also very good. Not a whole lot of things going on, but enough that you're pretty engaged (without being overwhelmed). The key is timing your cycle against other players (such that you leech their actions and they don't leech yours, if possible). Production values show their age a bit, and there are some imbalanced elements (first corn player and craftsman being two famous ones), but it's an enjoyable classic.

Over the years I have gone off this game as other players love it, play it more often and just become better at it than me. There is no great pleasure in playing a game you know you are going to lose

RATING: 5
Puerto Rico feels very constrained.  All information is open or trackable, there are set resources and few random elements. I've played it four times and each game has felt more Chess-like; chin-strokingly studious, short on interaction and with increasingly formulaic play. I like it better than its cousins Goa and Caylus, but coming from me, that's not an accolade.

Another classic with strategic depth. So many options, it's difficult to work out what's best, especially when buying buildings.

Finally got my own copy of this after borrowing a friend's for a year. 15 years old and still so streamlined and fresh. Most releases every year still fail to live up to this. A gamer's game.

RATING: 6
Puerto Rico was an interesting game to initially learn, but I'm just not excited to play Puerto Rico compared to other games.  Simply put, there isn't enough variation or player interaction:  no direct contention for board position, no trading, no fun really.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
 - San Juan (the thematically related card game) has a similar feel, but is much faster to learn, setup, and play.
 - Agricola is a similar type of game with much improved game mechanics such as start cards and varied player action order.

PR is one of my favorite places on the planet, I've spent a lot of time  down there, so maybe I'm biased.  Corn baby, corn!  I will bury you under a mountain of corn!  We've enjoyed PR and feel it deserves its place near the top.  It's quick too.

:arrowE: [u]Synopsis[/u]:
Pick a role. Everyone gets to take the action, but you do it better. The granddaddy of Role Selection, a giant among Euros, the shoulders upon which much stands today. Produce goods through the combination of plantations and related refinement structures, ship said goods for points, sell said goods for cash, buy buildings, populate the island, utterly screw your opponents. 

:arrowE: [u]What I like most[/u]:
You know, there are a crap-ton of Role Selection games nowadays. You know what else? Fun as they might be, they're not as good as Puerto Rico. This game laid the foundation for the mechanic, and frankly, it still does it the best. The action economy is so hinged on timing that it is impossible to play well without reading the table and noting trends and patterns. One must decide when to help oneself while also ensuring that the simultaneous action helps everyone else as little as possible. Watching the different role fire off at specific points is like watching an elegant set of gears tick from one moment to the next. I especially like the tipping point when everyone's economy is stable enough to start plowing through Captain and Builder actions.

:arrowE: [u]What I like least[/u]:
The illustration and (especially) graphic design are pretty lame in the original version, and I missed the boat (HA!) on the "Limited" anniversary edition which improves both. Good thing [person=50716][/person] made this exceptional redesign, which is the best in class for all categories!

11/16/17 EDIT: I'm moving this rating from 8 to 10 because, frankly, Puerto Rico only gets better each time I play it. To be honest, I don't know why I ever rated it anything else. With all of the great games available today, few of them eclipse how lovely and gripping this "old" game is.

Much easier to calculate and win than Agricola, it deserves its fame because it allows some player interaction (not Uwe Rosenberg :) game).

The small dissapointment came from the fact that there are turn when you see the average player stay and watch the better ones do stuff without having any option to react.

Experience does not count as much as being able to plan a few turns ahead.

EDIT: I 'broke' the 5-player game by building random cheap buildings and forcing the game to an early end. Not so much fun anymore...

Seems like there is always a right play and a bunch of wrong plays.  Too rigid, low fun factor.  mistakes make the next player win.  As many have said playing with someone who doesn't know the right strategies imbalances things.  There is some reaction to other players plays, but overall it's pretty boring and solitary.  Played 3, 4, and 5 player games.  It started out fun discovering buildings and interactions, once I knew the pieces it got dull quickly.  Might play again on the PC if I'm really bored.  Read someone else's review and "Scripted" is a good way to describe how I feel about this game.

A very good game with each turn being different depending on what your short term aim is. Involves a lot of different strategies and thought. It does suffer a bit that the last player or two (in a 5 player game) can easily be shafted through no fault of his own and this can be crippling. Will hopefully get a lot of plays in the future.

RATING: 10
Puerto Rico plays differently every time.  As long as you don't have the exact same strategy as someone else, the game becomes more of a race than an attempt to prevent the other player from scoring.  I have played several times and tried a different tactic every time.  It is a thoroughly enjoyable game with great artwork, but it is a hard game to get anyone but serious gamers to play.  REVAMP: I now own the game and have discovered the two player version.  My wife and I spend way too much time playing this two player.

I like this slightly more than Power Grid, but not as much as Agricola.  Either have trouble collecting enough money for buildings or shipping enough for points.

From early January 2009 through the end of September 2009 this was the only game to hit the table. We love the way player interaction works in this game. Not so much that one player can destroy you, but certainly enough to be a major hindrance. The one drawback is that seating position plays a huge role. Where you sit relative to the best players can make your game much more difficult.

May 2011:  Excellent theme integration. Great mechanic of choosing roles allowing for slightly better capability for choosing player, but nevertheless, allowing all other players to also utilize the role.  A certain brilliance to this game.  Can have some trouble with down time between turns...precluding a 10.  Yields 9 of 10.

A great great game, the best I've played. Always fun, fast and strategic/tactical with little to no downtime. Easy to learn, hard to master and plays suprisingly different each time, even though there is very little random elements and no luck involved. It has a nice amount of interaction and every decision is a tough one. It's also in my opinion a great and tight 2-player game. I actually think it plays best with two. It does need the expansion buildings in order to have enough variance for dozens of plays against same players. The 2nd edition/Anniversary-edition art is great and the game even has some theme to it.

Fun factor: 5/5
Strategy vs. luck: 5/5
Mechanics/gameplay tied to the theme: 3/5
Component/art quality: 4/5 (with "Anniversary"-edition art, but thin cardboard and awful coins)

Another game that didn't get played. Got this one in a trade becuase EVERYBODY talks about how great it is. But it was a hard pass. 1st is the components. Unless you get the deluxe version the tiles, cards,etc. are pretty sub-standard. But you honestly should come to expect that from Alea games of this era. But beyond that the game play wasn't engaging at all. It just felt tedious so we never even finished a full game. This is the top of the list for some Eurogamers but not for us. We'll stick with San Juan.

Rampant fanboyism left me quite skeptical about this one before I took the plunge, but it turns out that Puerto Rico actually is all that and a bag of (VP) chips. I don't get into the whole optimizing-the-bejeezus-out-of-it as other Euro-drones might; there are other ways I would prefer to spend 90-120 minutes. But given rum and a full complement of friends, PR provides a great time in/fun out ratio.

UPDATE: Knocked the rating up by .5 - who am kidding? Puerto Rico is rad.

RATING: 9
A superb, solid and serious game (albeit overrated, over-analyzed and over-played). What others do almost matters more than what you do. Much of the time your role selection is practically forced and involves no real choice; for example, if you take Craftsman you'll probably get screwed when the next player takes Captain. (The whole game seems to be funneled through the Craftsman, by the way.)  Having said all this, I do admit that the better players seem to win most of the time, and by 2017's low standards this is certainly a masterpiece.

Puerto Rico's flaws are more apparent now than they were 10 years ago.  The fixed player order, and the ease with which a novice can inadvertently throw the game to the player to his left, are major drawbacks.

But Puerto Rico marks a true inflection point in the history of modern board games, and deserves its status as a classic.  I still find it interesting after dozens of plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
One of the first modern games I played and it's a really good one.  It's famous enough that it probably doesn't need me to say much about it.

The nearly luckless pieces all fit together really well with lots of different choices offered -- primarily but not exclusively in the role selection.  Players can also follow different strategies to victory, using the different abilities offered by a variety of buildings.

After playing it a lot, I haven't played it in a long time as I've explored other games.  I'm curious if it will drop to a '9' when I revisit it.

RATING: 8
PROS:
*) Very little luck
*) Subtle player interactions, that become apparent only after a few plays
*) Different winning strategies, and you need to think ahead
*) At any given time, the number of choices are very limited (which makes the game relatively easy to learn)
*) Handy box, easy to take along
CONS:
*) Player interactions are not direct (which I personally miss)
*) At any given time, the number of choices are very limited (which makes you feel sometimes you can't control your destiny)

Upped this game from 7 to 8 after I realized how the subtle player interactions work.

RATING: 7
Excellent game with dozens of options to pursue which appears complicated to learn at first glace but is actually very simple once you get into a few rounds. Can tend to become a bit formulaic after many plays, and doesn't result to much in game conversation. Still very enjoyable and leaves you with a sense of satisfaction at the end as games often tend to be very close. 

My desire to play this has fallen. It is a good game. I respect it and what it does, it's just not that 'fun' to play. I seem to play this once or twice a year now and it is a pleasing little game. It feels like catching up with an old friend as everyone usually can just jump right into. As long as it is played not too seriously it is enjoyable.

This game looks insanely complicated, but I find it to be quite intuitive once you get your head around it.  I like the fact that everyone gets to play all the time, so there's not really much downtime.  It takes a long time to set up, but with everyone working together, it's not too bad.  My wife complains that it encourages the sale of tobacco, which she has renamed chocolate.

Sometimes I 'George Costanza' this and go against my instincts, buy buildings and try ideas I feel are not as strong as previous strategies ... and find out I can still win. Great game, everyone I have taught it to appreciates it and wants to play it again.

I am not an expert at PR, but it is one game I constantly win. I think this is due to the way I control shipping. It seems no matter what type of buildings I am choosing, I can accommodate that strategy by messing with the shipping.

I don't really like this game that much, which is why I will never buy a game based on its rating on this website. Nonetheless, there are lots of different strategies in this game. I feel like it's pretty dry though. Low player interaction. I don't like the random tile drawing either. I'm not a big fan of random tile drawing games. Someone said this game was just a "glorified spreadsheet" and I tend to agree. Caylus is too.

RATING: 5
While much has been praised about the game's design there are cracks in the fortress of the top rated game.  Players are likely to feel that there are significant options to play a strategy.  In truth this selection is more limited than not.  A player's actions are almost entirely dictated by the actions of other players.  This happens from the first turn and does not end until the game is finished.  This may leave players feeling like the game plays itself out rather than the players participating.  It's okay, but not the best game out there.  [GTI Code: TGSD]

An excellent, classic worker placement game where you're building plantations and buildings to gather up resources and then ship them for points. Plays smoothly, and I enjoy the role choice mechanics and rotation, keeps things exciting for a number of plays. Not the best game ever, but it deserves its popularity, and I think there's a lot of crossover appeal with games like Castles of Burgundy or Le Havre.

RATING: 7
A very good game, but moves down a notch on my list because everyone in my gaming group has much more experience on this game than I, and this is a game which richly rewards experience (like chess).  When playing with players of varying skill levels, it rapidly becomes uneven.  When I start picking with with whom and where I will try hard to get the game on the table it shouldn't be on the top of my list.

7/30/2009 Lowered the game rating to an 8.  This just doesn't hit the table as often any more, and when it does it doesn't shine as much in comparison to other games.

5 March 2008 - I've only played one game so far so I'm not really sure how much I'll like this after more plays. Getting a very short rules explanation, playing late in the evening and the tendency for new payers to hand the game to the player on their left means I'm quite happy with how I did (38 with the winner on 44) but I want to play again after reading the rules so I 'know' what I'm doing instead of just following advice most turns.
2008-08 Another couple of games and I seem to know what I'm doing now (5 away from winning one of those two games). More plays may up the rating I give this.
2008-11 More plays haven't increased my rating, even after I won two of those extra games.

This was my first contact with both modern board games as well as eurogames and it still is my one of my favorite games. I love playing without luck and building up my own production. It has many ingenious mechanics that works wonderfully together. The biggest problem I can see with it is that the replay value might go down over time. It is also quite a bother to set up. The variable phase order drives me nuts sometimes, the role selections have such huge impacts.

This is a great game.  It's one of those games where every time you think you have it mastered, it presents another level of complexity.  I love the lack of random elements (aside from the plantation selection, of course).  With a playtime of 45 minutes to an hour, this is my favorite short game.

The expansion is nice, but not at all necessary.  Most of the new buildings mirror the old ones in premise, if not exact function.  However, you can create some interesting combos with new and old.

The nobles are pretty broken.

Hmmm, 
The big problem with Puerto Rico is playing with inexperienced/aloof players.  The game breaks because it's too easy for a new or lazy player to hand the game to the player on his/her left without even knowing.
Another problem is the buildings are slightly imbalanced, some will be chosen more readily than others and if you deviate from this basic strategy by.. for example.. choosing the Office you'll likely run into cashflow trouble.

A lovely Euro, and really not dry at all (as some Ameritrashers love to deem it). The only drawback is slightly steep learning curve and the dreaded "winning strategy? Sit left of the newbie." syndrome. But if you like Euros, you'll like Puerto Rico, hands down.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
More than a decade after its release, Peurto Rico still manages to offer an incredibly rich euro-style gaming experience that competes with more modern titles. This is a game that every euro-gamer should try. 

For casual gamers, the game scales relatively well 2-5 players and offers immense replayability. The only "turn off" to casual/family gamers is learning the numerous buildings and how they interact with the various roles; simply put, the game will likely take a few plays until those players grasp the important nuances.

For competitive gamers, the game has low randomness and offers tons of brain-burning and tense decisions. That being said, there are some issues/complaints. For one, there seems to be a limited number of viable strategies (Building vs Shipping). Secondly, there seems to be an inherent advantage with sitting to the left-side of an experience player. And thirdly, the strengths/weaknesses of each strategy is really dictated by the group play; This makes the game more tactical and creates imbalances with odd-player counts. For instance, if 2-players are focusing on a shipping strategy and 1-player is focusing on a building strategy, the shipping strategy is likely to be more viable as those actions are being selected more often. As a consequence, the 4-player game is considered superior... but for most gamers, it works quite well 2-5 (Use Craftsmen Angst variant with 2-player). 

The only strong complaint I can make is with the component quality. For such a popular and widely-distributed game... it's very disappointing that the game art/components haven't been upgraded. 

The iOS adaptation is well done; they managed to place all the relevant information on one screen and create something that's easy to follow. The only things I would change would be some zoom-function, especially for the captain action, and an online lobby to make matchmaking easier. Other than that, it is a pleasure to play and the interface is better than BoardGameArena.

Update:
This game is very cutthroat, all you think about is how to screw your opponent (which is made worse in 2 player games).
If you play in a friendlier game - there isn't much game left in there- it is dull and boring. (like poker without bluffing)

The expansions don't help remedy this- now instead a knife fight in an alley' you have a knife fight at a bar.

Juego maravilloso. Mecanica del juego sencilla de explicar y varias opciones de victoria distinta. Como juego introductorio excelente...

Edito a 30-6-2011: Mediante la elección de roles se crean cada turno las fases que se han de jugar. Cada rol crea una fase y da un bonus a la persona que lo hubiera elgido. Se traen colonos a la isla, se crean plantaciones,  edificios, se hace producir a las plantacionmes y se llama al barco para exportar los bienes producidos... Sencillo de explicar, algo más dificil de controloar y con muchas posibilidades de pasarlo pirata... Realmente explicarlo a no-jugones es un placer... Les ves cómo se les van abriendo los ojos... y es que por algo el Puerto Rico es un juegazo. Para mí por detrás del Caylus o el Agricola, pero es que para ser justos el PR fue anterior a éstos y se puede jugar con no jugones ya que no abruma...

It's, simply put, a great game. It gets almost as good as you can expect. I think it could get a little better if only there was some sort of player trading, but asides from that, it's an excellent economic game, deserving a top spot in my collection.

UPDATE: Once I prepared my gaming group for more complex games, they really digged this one. Even my wife's grandmother loves it! Not only it's a great game, but it's also a great game that is enjoyed by most players, gamer-like or not!

UPDATE: I've started noticing it always playes more or less the same. I've been told this issue is solved with the expansion, but the game itself, without the expansion, is just not as fun as it used to be. Still a solid 8, but no longer a perfect game for me.

It has a great feel and a nice look to it.  One of my friends has commented several times about how she likes how "everything has it's own little place." :)

It's a thoughtful game and for the most part my group gets pretty quiet while playing and the interaction can seem sparse at times.  However you WILL hear cries of anguish or cackles of glee when one person gets blocked out of a crucial trade or shipment.


Some of the game's critics do bring up good points.  A players success can sometimes feel greatly tied to their position on the table and the game suffers a bit when playing with people of varied experience.  Plus there are times when it feels less like you are playing more against a system rather than people.

Overall I think the impact of these problems do not take away from the quality of the game.  It's a great experience.

Update:  Great game but the "Cult of the New" has ground down the rating a bit.  Still a tip top game.  But there are so many games out there!

RATING: 8
This game is a pretty good game from the few times I've played.  However, it is not for the feint hearted, and the finer points of the game take some time to pick up on. It suffers from the "who every sits to your left" syndrome, that is, that player determines to a great extent, how well the player to their right does in the game.  Also, it's kinds of a steep learning curve because every buildign presents itself as an execption to the rules, that is, it takes a while for a new guy to pick up on all the options that are there, and it slows down the game a bit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.9
This game used to be my favorite that I always wanted to suggest to play. Now it's not so much. I don't like the chess-like feeling of "OK, if I take the Builder, I'll build this. He'll probably build that. And she'll probably build that. Then he'll take the the craftsman, and She'll take the trader. Then next round he'll take the mayor...no, that doesn't work. OK, what if I take the craftsman?". You need to think too far down these decision trees, planning out not only your own turns but predicting each opponent as well. A catalyst for AP. Still, it's a great game underneath that, but that aspect can get very frustrating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Set up is tedious, as is clean up.
The game is very delightful to play with people of the same skill level, but if you are not evenly matched with the other players, the game starts to feel too scripted and feels like you are a puppet in a game.  

This "puppet" aspect of the game soured it for me pretty badly.  If played as a light, non-serious game, I give this game a 9, as a game that I play with others at conventions and on BSW, I rate it accordingly here.

In some games, I hate waiting for other people to take their turns. Usually, there's nothing to think about because the whole board will change before it gets around to you. 
Not in this game! Everyone goes on everyone's turn. What a concept...
Before you begin, practice chanting "craftsman, craftsman, craftsman, craftsman" under your breath.

Nagyon tetszett ez a játék, szívesen játszanék még vele. Amikor az első partit játszottam, akkor az a fajta társasjátékos voltam, aki két játékot ismer: a Catant, és a Carcassone-t. Ezek után érthetően sokk-ként ért a Puerto Rico, jóval komplexebb a másik 2 játéknál. Másodjára már sokkal jobban élveztem, nagyon tetszik a szerepek folytonos váltogatása, és az, hogy az egyes műveletek nem minden körben hajtódnak végre. A véletlen szerepe egyedül az ültetvények felcsapásánál jelenik meg, épp ezért a rutintalan játékosok szerintem meglehetősen nagy hátrányban vannak. Akivel én játszottam,annak pl. kialakult (nyerő?!) stratégiája van a játékra, ebben a helyzetben elég esélytelennek éreztem magam. Szükség lesz még néhány menetre, hogy készség szinten átlássam a játékot, akkor több eséllyel vágok neki.
---
Minden játékkal egyre jobban tetszik!

Közel 500 játékot kipróbálva nosztalgikusan gondolok erre az elsők közt kipróbált játékra. Azóta már rengeteg jóval összetettebb játékkal találkoztam, de ez a szerepválasztós mechanizmus mai napig az egyik legeredetibb ötlet, amivel találkoztam. (Oké tudom, hogy a Citadella előbb volt, mégis...)

First game after Settlers. Fell in love with the role selection mechanic. I think the element of randomness derived from the players choices is so much more fun than basic luck.
You find yourself trying to squeeze the "random" choices in one direction, but the other players are resisting doing things that will help others more than themselves.

great game - love the balance, and the multiple angles. Rarely have a whitewash game since the early days when Elise 'got it' before we did. :)

update: this had faded a bit. It actually felt a little dry the last time I played, after all the conflict heavy games I like.

This game has grown on me a lot. It plays quick and a good balance of strategy and tactics.  If it wasn't for the buildings, I would rate this a 10.  The buildings provide a tough barrier for new players.

Oh who am I kidding?  This is a 10.  I can't think that I will ever get tired of playing this game, especially with the expansion.  The criticisms of "screw your left" shananagans and feeling like you are forced to choose certain roles are completely valid.  However, that is only a problem if you let your OPPONENTS tell you what you should do.  They aren't there to help you win, they are just telling you to do certain things because it will help them out.  Throw them a curve ball here and there and they'll stop trying to force you to take certain actions.  There is just so many things going on in this game it is insane.  A lot of strategy/tactical goodness to be had here.
UPDATE: 9 -> 10

5-19-2007
As great as this game is I am going to have to deduct a point.  It just irritates me how this game cannot handle a group of varying skills.  So many times that the newbie/novice just helps out and sets up random people.  It is especially bad if they helped someone get a huge head start by letting them trade.  I also don't want the coin to fall in favor of me as I know the victory is not well earned.  I still like the game very much, but not as enthusiastic about it due to it's "fragility."  This really sucks the fun out of it.
Update: 10 -> 9

Update: 11 Nov 2007
I played this game again with 2 new people and I just did not enjoy it.  Typically teaching games to others is fun for me but the fact that the left-player binding is just too much for me.  Puerto Rico is really only fun when the players are about of the same skill level.
Update: 9 -> 8

Aug-08-2008
If playing with experienced players of similar skill level, then this game is a 9.  Unfortunately, I really really dislike the left/right binding effect that happens in this game when dealing with weaker players and it really just frustrates me to see someone getting crazy windfalls from mistimed crafting.  With that in mind it ranks down to 5 that I don't even want to play it.  So I'll just average the two extremes down to 7, which actually falls in quite nicely on how I feel about the game.    I'd play it if people want to and need a few more players, but I wouldn't request it and don't need to have my own copy.
Rating: 8 -> 7

Update: 2012.12.31
After trading it away, I ended up requesting this myself and playing with my friend's copies quite a bit.  I was even sad that when they don't bring it.  This game just hits such a sweet spot.  It is a fast game with such great depth.  No other game has such a great depth to game lentgh ratio.

Very good eurogame, with depth, strategy and diversity. However in comparison to better games, I do not still understand why it should be on the top 20. The mechanics were excellent for its time, but the overall game feels a bit weird. Particularly, I do not like the tile building restriction, and I do not like the kingmaking ability of the captain. Waiting for more plays to form a certain opinion.

edit: exceptionally strategic after more plays. Wish it was shifted on the development side though. A great eurogame.

I don't get a lot of play time with this one because the two-player variant is a bit lacking but I absolutely love playing with 3-4.

Every choice is rife with ramifications.  Little downtime.  A good blend of short-term play and long-term planning.  Each play is simple, but the total is complex/chaotic while still being manageable.  Good for two players; even more control and less downtime.
Not perfect though. 1) it takes too long, 2) five player games have too much chaos, 3) a non-optimal play by one player can seriously adversely affect others, and 4) the last few rounds of the game are less interesting (though very important).

The random plantation tiles keeps this game from being solved.  Although some buildings are just better to own in most game situations than others (Factory, Harbor, Wharf, Guild Hall) the competition for these buildings is actually what makes Puerto Rico worth playing.  I have pimped my copy of PR with buildings that feature artwork lifted from San Juan.  The artwork is located under the files section for Puerto Rico.

Played twice!  Once with a random mixture of standard and expansion buildings.  The second time using a draft version in which we chose which buildings to include.  So far I actually prefer playing with the expansion buildings! 


[b]Alea Treasure Chest Expansion: Nobles[/b]
Played once!  It's a worthy expansion for it adds not only new buildings, but also a new type of colonist.

When I first played this game, I was kind of underwhelmed, given the popularity of this title.  Then, that night I had a dream... a dream in which I was playing Puerto Rico, and devising all sorts of new strategies.  I just picked this up at a Barnes & Noble board game clearance, and needless to say I'm looking forward to giving it another whirl!

RATING: 6.5
Puerto Rico is a good game.  Overall, I have enjoyed my experiences with Puerto Rico.  Is it the best game I've played?  No.   Do I understand why it is rated so high?  Yes.

Basically, I like being able to build up my island while trying to estimate what my opponents are going to do at the same time.  I enjoy the economic aspects of the game, though at times I feel a little strapped for cash and it negatively affects my enjoyment of the game.  I find it scales very well and have enjoyed the two player variant even more than playings with five.

One of the tightest and most satisfying game-play/boardgame experiences I've ever had.  No wonder this game was #1 on the BGG charts forever long.

2.1.12 - After 5 plays in, this game continues to impress.  I can't say the same about Le Havre, which I just traded away.  PR continuously provides a rich gaming experience regardless of the outcome.   

4.3.12 - Since my last edit, I've had a chance to play a couple of 4 and 2 player games.  This game has not lost any of its "flavor," even though I've had a chance to play several other games in between my last group of plays (i.e. TtR: Marklin, Power Grid, Twilight Imperium 3 - all good games by the way), and I thoroughly enjoy the PR no matter if I win or lose.  This game belongs in any gamers collection.  One added recommendation, if you are a fan of Euro-style games, think about shelling out the extra money to get the Anniversary Edition for the nicer components, plus both expansions.  This will be a game you will most likely own for a long long time.

4.20.12 - PR is quickly becoming the crown jewel of my game collection.

Most all the friends I've shared this with enjoy it.  Very accessible, even if it doesn't look like it at first.  [Market price]

[i]Posted: 10/3/05, Rated: 8[/i]

After four or five games of [i]Puerto Rico[/i], I can say that I really like it.  From the stutter-step turn order of the Governor placard, to the seemingly myriads of tactical uses for the different roles (offensive captaining is so much fun!), there are a lot of nuances to absorb.

I have not yet tried the online version of this game on BSW, for the simple reason that I don't want to be ridiculed for being a newbie.  I know I am.  My skill level is proportionate to my gaming group, and we enjoy playing this game.

However, it is a bit more complicated, and takes longer to play than [i][thing=8217]San Juan[/thing][/i].  Right now, [i][thing=8217]San Juan[/thing][/i] gets more table time, simply because it is easier to approach and to learn.  For that reason, [i][thing=8217]San Juan[/thing][/i] gets the "9," and [i]Puerto Rico[/i] the "8."  Perhaps in a few months time as the group's abilities improve, these positions will be reversed.

I'll never turn it down.  I play this game at least once a week online, and I love it so much more in person.  Everything just works, and the system is closed and beautiful.  No lose ends, no rules that make no sense, and no surprises.  It's one of the few games that has a lot of rules, but where after two plays you never again need to consult the rule book.  My only complaint is the University;  I've never bought it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Since it's the highest rated game on BGG I had to try it out and got an opportunity in a game of 4 players. 2 were beginners (me included) and 2 had played it a few times before. I had played San juan that is the sister game to Puerto Rico alot of times before but Puerto rico proved to include a great deal more elements and tactical choises.
First time playing it was hard to go for a strategy and the order in which you can take your turns and who sits before you and what tactic they go for will influence you a great deal in this game. Doing your own race can easily become a nightmare if the person ahead of you (in all but 1 turn when you are first) uses a tactic that will cancel out the effect of your brilliant tactical scheme.

Overall this is among the better games I have played but I can't put it as number one as I've enjoyed other games just as much or even more.

Yep - really like this, but not quite as much as Agricola (PR seems a bit drier). However, I like the challenges it creates. I've managed to get this on with the group because I shocked them with this in the first few days of the game nights - they didn't know any better. And they learned it, but I got the feeling that it was a bit . . . what.... highbrow, for them? We regressed into the more gateway like games, but I'll get them back on the ship!

11/2012: Okay, have a good core group interested in playing this multiple times. Different winners, strategies, etc. We're all getting good at the point accumulation, 50+ in many cases.

RATING: 9
A wonderful design, with a good deal of strategic and tactical depth. The role selection mechanic is very interesting, and the rest of the game works very well, with a good implementation of chance (plantations), scarcity/demand, and a reasonable amount of player interaction for a game that provides each player with his own board rather than allowing for interaction on a common board. The main problem plaguing Puerto Rico, and perhaps the only thing really holding it back, is the 'player on the right' effect, where the player to the right of the player who makes a bad move (generally crafting, but sometimes neglecting to take a role that would disproportionately help the next player) benefits the most. Over a number of rounds, this effect can greatly affect the results of the game. In some games, a player makes a bad move that benefits everyone else equally (mostly in widening the scoring gap); in others, a player makes a bad move that benefits one other player, but can later make a bad move that benefits a different player. In Puerto Rico, a poor player provides a large advantage almost exclusively to the person who has the first opportunity to capitalize on the mistake. It's not just a problem of 'Player X failed to stop the leader', but a problem of 'Player X's actions unevenly benefited one person throughout the game'. Still, Puerto Rico is a great game, and it is hard to fault it too much. (2009-07)

Update: For players of equal skill, I'd rate this a 10 (rating was previously a 9 due to the 'player on the right' effect). For more mixed groups, the rating suffers a bit. I'm not sure by how much, as it is certainly still enjoyable, but it isn't as good of a game without all players operating at the same level. But this is true of most games, so it's hard to fault Puerto Rico for it. (Addendum: I suppose there may be some balance issues with 3- and 4-player games due to the trading house only having 4 spaces, rather than N spaces [e.g., one player gets a double-trade opportunity in 3p, or one player gets shut out in 4p] but -- as with the 'player on the right' effect -- I'm not sure this is a flaw meriting a decrease in the game's rating. If anything, the fact that there are some buildings that are of marginal utility in [i]any[/i] strategy while others are highly beneficial in almost any situation is a bit of a fault. However, this makes competing for those few buildings tense, rather than simply allowing players access to a victory point buffet through every building, which is a good thing in my view. So even the 'imbalance' in the building set is ok.) (2014-01)

The phase selection allows for screwing over other players. Also, allows for turn order to randomly screw you.

I really enjoy Puerto Rico. I think it is the quintessential role selection game.

I have a degree in economics so this type of game is right up my alley.  I love building a system that can produce the various items.  There is also great interaction though out the game play as each role picked by your opponent will have an effect on you.  The system of placing money on unused roles is brilliant as it gives clear incentive for less appealing roles and also insures that each phase will occur every few rounds.  Fast moving and interesting, a great game.

This was my first worker placement game that I have ever played and I absolutely loved it.  It is quite simple and very even matched regardless of player order.

Finally got around to playing this game (Have owned for a year). We have a weekly game night and this was always pushed aside do to the length of time to learn and then lenght of time to play. This is a really, really good game. The machanics are fun and incorporate many of my favorite mechanics from different games. Everything you do effects the entire group so player interaction is high. It does not need to be devious and you are not attacking other players however everything you do will either positively or negatively effect everyone else.
 
Even though there is a lot going on it is not difficult to play, you really need to dive in to fully understand the rules. Play time was also not as bad as advertised. We stayed within the projected game time on our first run while figuring everything out. This game can be played in under 120min. Bottom line, this game is really all it is cracked up to be and deserves it spot at the top of every board game list. One of the best games I have ever played. I thought about strategies for 5 days after my first play. Wow. You really need this one in your collection.

A fun time, it struck me at first play and made its way home sooner than some others I was aware of around the same time. A bit out of order in fact, and that really tells you what you need to know.

Yes I thought it would fit my current regular group better than the others, and yes it has performed well in front of a mixture of that group.

Bottom line is the game has been enjoyed, and is a solid worker placement game, there are no lasers or muskets even in this one, if you want to manage resources and workers, then this one is for you. While reading to learn is ALWAYS prudent about new games,Its elegance shows through in play.

RATING: 8
People in my group have played this a lot more than I have, and resulting game play through difference in skill level has been a bit frustrating. Tonight was the first time where I played it with another novice, which gave me a bit of a chance to explore without being clubbered from all sides, which was great.

I can see it being a great game, but I don't see it as great to the exclusion of so many other wonderful games out there. Still feel that even though there are many strategies you can follow, too often I feel forced to take the "obvious" one, either because otherwise one player benefits disproportionally, or simply because it's the one move that screams out to be made. It also feels shorter than I would like it to be. The ending can come really sudden, it has a habit of finishing two or three turns too early for my liking. Still not sure if the sort of game play I like best actually fits in the turns available.

It's a game I would love to like more, but it hasn't done it for me just yet. Maybe people have just raved about it a bit too much, it made me wonder from the beginning if this would be my ultimate game too. And judging against perfection, so far it falls a few hurdles short.

It is telling that I had it for over 2 years before I cracked it open. The temptation to play wasn't exactly urgent, despite all the good stories. Maybe I am really looking for something else from my game nights, or maybe I have just too many alternatives around me to get bowled over by a single game. It isn't always the best game that pleases me most.

UPDATE: starting to bore me a bit. Maybe I feel it is becoming a bit too mechanical. Maybe playing too many games with similar mechanisms just now. Rating down from 8.5

Puerto Rico just doesn't do it for me.  I can't explain it.  Going through the rules, playing games with both experienced and inexperienced players, playing a couple versions of the two-player game... it just doesn't do it for me, even though I've played games that are as complex, far simpler, and far more complex.

Currently on loan to a friend.  If he and his wife like it, it will stay on loan to them permanently.

Initial impression. Repeated play will determine if it holds up. The constant changing of the game turn sequence of play via the selection and then immediate play of a role card adds another level of decsion making. A much deeper game than P.of Florence.

This is my new favorite game. The number and complexity of the decisions can be overwhelming, but after a few plays, the proper strategy is coming into focus. I like that every player is always doing something. I also like the indirect conflict among the players: when to select which role, what to sell/ship/buy, etc. I want to play this game right now!

Tästä kaikki alkoi. Puerto Rico oli ensimmäinen uusista "kunnon" lautapeleistä, mitä pelasin. Ja olihan se hyvä. Pikkasen kaavamaiselta tuntui kuitenkin jo muutaman pelin jälkeen. Sitten tuli vielä Caylus, ja ai että ku se oli hyvä. Sen koommin en ole Puerto Ricosta jaksanut innostua. Ehkä tätä onki pelannu liian vähän, kun ei nappaa. (17.3.2009)

Arvosana nousussa, kun pelejä on taas kertyny pitkän tauon jälkeen. BSW:ssä pelattu useita pelejä, livenäkin muutama. BSW:ssä peli voi mennä alle tuntiin, eikä livenäkään pelit ole venyneet samoihin mittoihin kun silloin joskus. Pelejä on voitettu sekä laivausseolla, rakennusääryydellä että hybriditällillä, joten taktiikoita riittää. Ompa tullut kokeiltua jotain hämäriäkin juttuja, eikä tulos ole mikään katastrofi ollut, joten vaihtelua riittää. On kyllä hyvä peli. Pikku hiljaa koiteltu myös lisäosaa, ja bsw:ssä tulee randomilla muutama rakennus siitä, joten vaihtelu on mukavaa ja piristivää, mutta ei liiallista. (26.2.2010)

I like the game... but having played race for the galaxy and other resource management games such as le havre, agricola and the like BEFORE I tried puerto rico... I might not see how great and revolutionary it might have been 10 years ago.
It's still a very good and solid game. But one I would play once a month rather than once a week.

Edit: After three plays I find it quite dry (like Caylus). I prefer more colorful games (at least... I perceive them as such) like Agricola or Le Havre.

I can understand why this was rated number 1 for so long. While it is not my personal favorite, it is a fantastic game. I can't see this game getting old very quickly, if it ever gets old at all. 

The game is easy to learn, but the strategy is complex. Understanding how your actions will benifit other players is an important part of the game and takes a little while to come to grips with.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I've heard complaints that the game lacks sufficient randomness, that there's an objective Best Move you can make on any given turn -- and that some players will lose their shit if you do anything else.

Whatever.  I've never encountered anybody that insufferable, and I still have a hell of a lot of fun playing this.  (Though I admit, the implications surrounding the "colonists" and their "colony ship" do squick me out a bit.)  This is a role selection and resource management brainburner that forces me to think several steps ahead, and bite my nails in the hopes that other players' choices won't hose my carefully laid plans.  Even when I'm doing poorly, the game keeps me engaged from start to finish.  It's a classic for a reason.

Wouldn't go so far as to say it's the greatest game of all time but still certainly very good.  Maybe a groundbreaker in its day but has been copied so much now that it's difficult to see what's so amazingly special.  Also spoiled by the fact that it has a very boring theme (the original sci-fi theme would have been *much* better)!

RATING: 8
Great 4 or 5 player game with multiple paths to victory.  I think it's a reasonable game to teach to light/non-gamers who have played something like Settlers, as the mechanics are incredibly simple to explain even if the game setup looks daunting.  3 and 4 player matches can often let players stick to pet strategies, but 5 player games really require adaptation and a close observation on the tactics of the players to the right.

As someone who only played the game AFTER it had swept the world off its feet I have to say, most of the hype is totally deserved. A great game with lots of decision making. My only problems with it are that there is a slight lack of player interaction (it pays to know whats going on with the other players in order to make smart moves, but that's not really INTERACTION) and also the possiblity for very experienced players to fall into set patterns of play. Overall though a great time.

Every time I play this game I'm amazed by the simple, but deep mechanics. The only random factors include choosing the player order (literally where you sit at the table) and the selection of the plantations that will be available. A masterfully balanced, role/action selection scheme drives the game. Bribes increase the value of roles that are not selected in any given round to encourage players to take advantage of them in following rounds. Multiple game end possibilities (out of colonists, out of victory points, or out of building space) lead to a game that never ends in quite the same way and usually tends to end just as a few people are really gathering momentum. Perfect.

Its popularity over other games is due to the fact that Puerto Rico is so "positive."  You're always building, always producing, always developing.  Win or lose, you've made yourself some crops and come a long way since that first crummy plantation tile.

Clear rules, a little bit of theme to help you getting the rules, many different but balanced strategies and a lot of interaction. The interaction is what makes this game really good. After your first or second play, you may not know it, but this game is extremely interactive. The interaction is just elegant. Its not about stealing action spaces, or resources from someone. Not about attacking someone. Its about doing things that benefit you the most, and everyone else less. The role selection mechanism, that forces you to think what every turn gives you and everyone else is just great.

I like this game.  It's fun. There's not much player interaction but what there is consists mostly of screwing the other players out of plays (like buying the last building or filling up a cargo ship).

This game is great! A 2 player, 3 player, 4 player, and 5 player are all different experinces. Five player seems to be the most random. I love the idea and components of this game. Its play time is quick. Best to play with experienced players.

11/1/07: This game is good, but is missing a much needed expansion. Not just different building tiles, but also some new roles. The mechanics and theme have a nice flow, but the game is feeling more and more scripted. Only the 2 player and 4 player games appeal to me and even those games can't have any new players. I have lowered my rating to 7 as it slowly slips out of my top 10.

RATING: 4
I finally played and I did not like it anywhere near as much as I thought I would.  This seems like a game for those people who like playing one game a lot and trying to grasp the little nuances of that game.  It is not a game for people who pull out a particular game and play it occasionally.  

With the exception of some new games which get played a lot when they first come out, I tend not to play the same game over and over.  I believe you do have to play this game that way to properly learn how to play it even slightly well.  

I know people who play it regularly and really enjoy it and I will not be playing it with them since I know going in that I wouldn’t even be competitive since I really don’t care a lot about [i]Puerto Rico[/i] or its strategies and there are lots of other deep games which will allow most players to be competitive.  

It might be different if I thought the edge the experienced players had was pure skill, but I feel it is more a familiarity of the workings of all the different (and way too many) parts of the game which give them the advantage, not skill.  There are also lots of fiddly bits to this game and no place to put them while playing.  It really needs a larger center board to organize the roles, the goods, the "colonists", the plantation tiles, and anything else which doesn’t have a set spot.  I’ve played 11 of the 13 big box Alea games and this would be my tenth or eleventh favorite of those games.  I don't think it is a bad game, it just isn't one I expect to ever be excited about playing again.

RATING: 7
I feel like this games suffers from poor design at the onset of the starting positions.  If you look a the statistics for the game, 3rd and 4th positions (I think) win at an abnormal rate.  The buildings never change so replay value suffers.  Also, the worker pieces are brown and it feels  slightly racist.  Could've just made them blue or green.

Its fairly fun, but for such luckless Euro mechanics, there is a fair amount of luck involved in what other people chose to do. The 'colonist' whitewash (if you'll pardon the pun) is at least fairly funny the first few games, and ironic considering the clientele that enjoy eurogames.

So a bunch of dark "tokens" arrive by boat and I have to put them to work in my fields and buildings without pay?  A lightly tasteless nod to the harsh realities of slavery at the time if it's not a colourization oversight.  Owned by Adj?

IT'S A FUCKING SPREAD SHEET MADE FLESH (or paper)!!

Yes, you can certainly effect other people, but not in a satisfying way.  To get revenge on someone making it so I couldn't sell my goods took six turns and almost cost me the game.  

If you play with someone new to the game sit to their left to be assured of an easy win.  A bad player on your right will hand you the game every time.  Seriously, this is a game of finding optimal moves, not having fun, and every time you play it, THE ZOMBIES ALWAYS WIN.

RATING: 7.5
Lovely, well balanced, thoughtful and fun. I am going to go out on a limb and call it "Agricola lite". 

Update - Just had my first game with less than 5 players and I nearly changed my rating down a couple of points. 5p is certainly the sweet spot.

Update - after 5 games - you know what, I am getting a bit bored with PR. It is an OK game but at well over an hour is too long for something that seems to play out in the same way over and over again.

Further update - yawn, just so negative. You are never trying to improve your own position or really plan a strategy, just working out how to do things that minimise the benefit for other players. An OK game but I would rather play others.

Update after 29 games: Starting to see the attractions of PR again, it is tough for new player in a mixed group but a game between experienced players can be good fun.

The first time I played this game, I liked it, but not nearly as much as others.  I didn't think there was anything earth-shatteringly new as far as mechanics go.  I have since changed my opinion.  I have played twice since then and I now think it's great!

[A friend gave me his copy.]
Works well with 3, 4, or 5, though they're very different games. Only played it with 3 once, but it seemed to end much sooner than it does with more players; I thought I'd have at least a few more turns to do what I'd planned.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A truly great game. Only reservation are
1)the strong turn-order coupling which can allow one player to inadvertently hand the game to the player on their left.
2)somewhat scripted openings after extended play.
But that is nit-picking, if you haven't played PR, buy it, play it, love it.

A mixed bag for me. I've never played the game and not had fun, but I'm not usually excited when someone recommends playing it.

The overall game is very good, but I often find people's strategies are very similar from game to game, only making small adjustments as jobs are taken each round.

Feels like there will be a point where everyone has only one strategy that works best for them and every game afterwords will be mostly the same.

A system that demands your respect in how all the seemingly complex component parts come together in a surprisingly straightforward way (ie not terribly hard to teach).

I came very late to this Puerto Rico. Not only did I catch the bug late, I thought of myself as much more of a thematic gamer so I avoided Euros. When I began dabbling, I found myself seeing so many games being compared to this standard that I had to get it played. I am so glad I did. It might not offer the thrills of narrative and the laugh all around of other games in my collection, but Puerto Rico offers its own charms on its own terms. It's a tight, dense, thinky game in which one can plunge and still find room to dive. I love this title, particularly for three. I've learned to embrace it for what it is because it does that so well.

Update: Still a really great game...buuuut has been replaced by Roll for the Galaxy for me. I won't forget it and the HOURS I have spent playing this one...but it is not likely to hit the table any time soon.

I absolutely loved this game when it first came out--I would have given it a 9.  But the better I got, the less I liked the game.  Luck barely plays a role so what you're left with is a game where the luck that [b]does[/b] occur (namely, the seat draw) dominates unless a player makes a "mistake."  And then when a player makes a mistake, people usually get very upset about having their perfect game ruined.

Nowadays, I'd much rather play San Juan.  A 7 might be generous, but Puerto Rico entertained me for a very long time, and it was an innovative design.

I'm a big fan of this game. It doesn't have theme You can feel (it could be called "Aruba", "Cuba", "Jamaica" instead of "Puerto Rico"). Game is about producing goods like coffee, corn and the like and exporting Your products (don't know where, maybe Europe, doesn't matter). To produce You need plantations and processing buildings. When You have them You need to hire colonists (without them You can't manufacure). If You're ready to sell some stuff You have to bring it to the local market (You will get money) or freight it to "Europe" (victory points). 

- game is extremely involving, rules are easy to learn but gameplay is very challenging
- playing time (approx 80-120 minutes), 1-5 players
- it comes with expansion buildings in the box
- game is "super dry" & ugly ;) but for me it doesn't matter if I enjoy it.

STRONG RECOMMENDATION!

Wonderful game. Guess what the other players will do, then make the best choice from that. Then notice the players don't do what they should :-).
The downside is that there should be slightly more randomization.

I used to enjoy this game.  It gave me the impression that many options were available for strategic play.  I now believe that is an illusion.  I found eventually that my opponents that had greater opportunity to play had a far greater probability of winning.  This rewards the experienced player too much for my taste.  Such heavily scripted openings are not interesting to me.  I'm better now at identifying games like this, and knowing that in the long run they aren't my kind.

Puerto Rico is rated highly for a reason.  It is really well balanced and prevents any one single strategy winning every game.  You must know how to adjust to what is presented and try to force your opponents into inadvertently helping you.  However, the game struggles in that playing with individuals who are not at a similar experience level can completely unbalance the game.  An inexperienced player choosing an ill advised role on a turn can tremendously change the flow of the game.

Another classic.

Puerto Rico has made me realize a game feature that I love but had never noticed: chaos.  By this, I don't mean the random luck that people frequently associate with the word, but true chaos in a mathematical sense.  The tiniest change of decisions in this game can have an immense ripple effect on the rest of the game.  I've played it hundreds of times, and while there have always been moves/strategies that are "better," it still plays out differently each game.

Sometimes we look back and wonder what happened that made a game go such a different way, and it's always the tiniest of details. I love that.  It's a sign of a perfectly balanced game, and one that has so far provided great replayability.

The fact that the game is unbalanced with one or two bad or inexperienced players in the group makes that I didn't play the game any more.

The influence of the buildings on the different actions is hard too get for new players, and even experienced gamers don't get it soon since the buildings and the rule changes they cause are necessary but fiddle-some.

I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I LIKE PUERTO RICO OR RACE FOR THE GALAXY BETTER.

I KNOW I HAVE RACE RATED HIGHER BUT THAT'S PROBABLY JUST BECAUSE I OWN IT AND I PLAYED IT MORE RECENTLY.

Race for the Galaxy wins, but I don't own Puerto Rico, so whenever I get to play it I find it fresh and exciting.

RATING: 5
I really tried to like this game, but many of the mechanics are contradictory in nature and very limiting in the wrong ways.  The odd-ball combination of these strange mechanics takes a supposed strategy game makes it into a "luck-of-the-draw", "First to Fortune" game where no strategy really works, and it just becomes chaos and waiting for whoever ever lucked out to win.

Crop Exportation:  Resources shipped out get the same victory point valve no matter what.  This means more expensive and harder to build crops (Tobacco and Coffee) don't grant you anything over the simplest crops (Corn).  Yes, the more "valuable" crops can get you more money on the market... if you are able to sell them (given the market being locked down or loosing most the stock during the shipping phase.)

The cost to harvest more expensive crops ruins whatever financial gains you might have.... IF you can even get those financial gains.  It's very easy for a player to be stuck trying to get the crop/processing plant combo working... and the player with the most corn crops is just churning out victory points like there is no tomorrow.  Even if you are able to sell you expensive crops by some chance, it only is enough to break even from the effort wasted on the processing plants.

Timing/Order Screw-overs:  It is very easy for another player's timing and phase to put a halt on whatever progress you've had.  Finally managed to produce that expensive crop?  Just wait until another player chooses the shipping phase right after you... and all the other players load junk onto the boats that prevents you from getting some victory points out of the deal.  (Warehouses you say?  When can I get the money to build that when the market is completely clogged up since someone else offloaded similar crops before me?)

"Walking Dead" very easy:  It is very easy to get hamstringged by circumstance and be stuck walking dead for the entirety of the game with no real effective means of recovering.  You could play your cards right and still be undone in a spectacular way.  You could try to recover, but often those efforts will similarly destroyed or will be too little to make a difference.  Hence, you are just idly waiting for a game victory trigger to occur.

Worker Allocation:  It is very easy to build useful buildings, but be unable to use them during key phases.  Yes, you can be Mayor can get new colonist and allocate them... but it is usually a moot point and you've already missed out on key production phases, shipping phases, and other events by the time you can move workers where you need to.  And if you are in the wrong order position, you will often not receive the worker you need... even if you are contributing the most empty spaces that translate to a larger pool.

Accessory Victory Point Buildings:  Many of them are decent... But due to limited financial flow and the chances of being crippled for a majority of the game, you won't be able to purchase them.  A VP building could easily net you the winning points, but you'll be stuck unable to acquire it or you'll devote the resources to get it... to only have other players negate the VP bonus by cheesing/working the system in cheaper fashions.

The game could be much better, but I don't think the developer really understands economics, psychology, and game theory very well.  There are signs of some purposeful intent to create a game that is a resource producing, city-building strategy game... but the mechanics fall short and just make it in a luck/luckless fest that shares more in common with Monopoly.  (At least in Monopoly there is player elimination which would at least bring mercy to player stuck walking dead.)

Good fast moving game having surprising depth for what initially appears to be a simple Euro style game. All of the elements mesh together almost perfectly and it is rare to find anyone that doesn't really enjoy the game once they've been introduced to it. It's easy to learn but has some depth and has a good fun factor. On the other hand, despite the elegance of its design, I'm finding my interest gradually waning (something I'm finding with a lot of the Euros that initially caught my interest). See my review for more details (by Bubslug).

Ratings show this is one of the best games ever! If you loathe 'muliplayer solo' then this might not be for you as player interaction is subtle and limited. Maybe I've played this game too much? I've got to the stage where I'll play it if someone wants to but I don't recommend it, and when I play I'm not that interested, my play is almost mechanical (I'm following a route or walkthrough solution on auto pilot) - hence rating changed from a '10' to a 6

*** Update, played again recently and dropped my rating to a 5. I'm pretty much done with this game now ... and it really annoys me the way this game seems to attract gamers who long to tell you what you should and shouldn't be doing in your turn. It's my turn, let me do what I like, if it isn't what you were expecting, tough ... grr.

Ahhh... the sound of sea gulls and the surf crashing in the bay.  The smell of burning driftwood coconuts and seafood and rum drifts from a nearby table and we need to manage the trade center.

This game is a very enojyable game but some imbalance could arise with experienced players(CAYLUS COMMANDO!!!) out of a lack of chance to change initative.  Changing initiative even once a game could make this game a lot more competative.  That being said there are some lovely mechanics where players have a chance to selct rolls they will take on each turn.  Coosing a particular roll allows the chooser a slight benefit with that roll(ie builder gets a slight advantage at building a particular building....)

Interesting game that gave us the concept of role selection with a "kicker".  Everyone gets to perform the base action the role permits (Settler, Mayor, Captain, etc) but only the player who picked the role gets the extra kicker or "privledge" (Extra colonist, VP, etc.).  At first it is fun to develop and manage the new colony of Puerto Rico but after a while the game gets stale.  There's little in the way of player interaction other than trying to predict what roles the others will play and trying to "piggyback" your plans on top of their selections.  Also the game can suffer from inadvertend kingmaking when there are different levels of players in the game.  (ie a new player in a game with 3 veterans)  Definitely only play with 4 or less.  Anything more and the game really slows down and starts to feel like the game is playing you.

A strong economic game that is not too bogged down in rules complexity. It has a lot of strategic depth thanks to its role selection mechanic. This game can also be surprisingly cutthroat for a game with not much direct player interaction.

Got this game back in 2003. Opened it, saw the 16 page rule book, read it, put the game back in the cabinet, never tried it since. I mean, how in the world am I going to explain my wife how to play this? Sold it.

Update+ Recently I bough this game again for 10 USD (TrU sale). Read the rules again and it made much more sense this time. I introduced it to my wife and neighbor and they both liked it. We played a 2 player game and two 3 player games. Lots of interesting mechanics and it seems there are several ways to win the game. Initial rating an 8, but I have to play it another 2 or 3 times before I can give it a final rating.

Update++ I have played this game about 12 times now, and it is still great. it works with 2,3 and 4 players. I might give this a 9.

Update+++ Played it about 15-20 times now and I love it. It helps that I win quite often. Prefer to play with 4 players, but 3 works as well and even the 2 player version has its charms. It's a 9.

Update++++ Okay, I have had this game now for about 4 years, played it about 25 times and I still love it. I introduce the game to about 5 or 6 people every year and they all like it a lot. I have played Agricola quite a bit as well, but personally I feel Puerto Rico is just the more fun game of the two. I really like the strategic play. You first start building your engine and then towards the end of the middle of the game you start to reap your rewards, and your opponents are just amazed to see how much money/goods you are raking in the whole time and there is nothing they can do about it. Awesome!

"7" after first play (2 player game - official alea variant). Looking forward to playing next game (probably we will try craftsman angst variant). I hope that after few more plays it will be 9 or even 10/10 :) It has great potential.

"9" afer second play (2 player game - Craftsman Angst variant with few more minor patches). I'm scared of this game. I think it's almost perfectly balanced and tested. Pure diamond in terms of game mechanics. Unfortunately, my fiance states that it's quite boring. In my opinion this game is much deeper than choosing roles and making our moves. It's prediciting, calculating and trying not to help our opponents more than ourselves. It's going to be one of my best board games soon. I'm falling in love with PR!

Almost 10/10 after playing it with 3,4 and 5 players!!! LOVE IT! My ass get kicked every time I play this, but it doesn't matter :D The great thing about Puerto Rico is that when you loose you know why and can try not to repeat your mistakes in next games. Really high replayability thanks to two expansions. I like it most with 3 and 4 players.

I don't doubt the champions of this game as they describe its depth and beauty and whatever else.  I just don't understand how they can consider this game fun.  Either a game needs a modicum of luck (like the draw of cards -- something even Agricola has) or its need sufficient depth that even after a large number of plays there is no definitive strategy (e.g. Chess, Go).  While I have only played it twiceo, I was left with the feeling that if I played it enough times, it would degenerate to Player 1 to play and win.  No thanks!  

After the second play, I see the interaction between players but I still feel it is Player 1 to play and win.

On the basis of this and Princes of Florence, I'm tempted to say there's an emerging genre here, which alas doesn't appeal to me much at all. Clearly it has appeal to many, but I would forewarn against introduce newcomers to gaming to games like this.

In summary, I played this and though it's a cross between Citadels,. Princes of Florence, St. Petersburg and Die Haendler - unfortunately I prefer the simplicity of Citadels and St. Petersberg and the elegance of Die Haendler miles ahead of this melange in Puerto Rico.

The learning curve is large here, lots of fiddly detail when it comes to buying from a library of buildings with different benefits. The player interaction is moderate or low, with no central arena in which action takes place that stimulated my imagination, but rather each player holding their own little board and hoarding goodies on it strategically. There is a very clever and very impressive role selection mechanism that drives this game, but you can get much the same thing in Citadels which doesn't take itself so seriously as a game (I admit) - has less distraction around the role mechanism and a little more plain old luck.

I can't help but wonder why games like this aren't made with a central board depicting the island of Puerto Rico and everyone playing their buildings and plantations upon it enabling some interaction in terms of layout and territory perhaps and definitely some sense of interaction which these solitaire boards fail to provide me with.

One of the few games I'm always willing to play, unless I'm on fire.

I've been known to stay late at conventions in order to squeeze a copy of this in, and I'm known in my group as being an available opponent when someone wants to get this game going.

Not a big fan of the 'expansion tiles'.

Update (March 2008): Purchased the software version of PR and have been playing with the expansion tiles a lot now. Definitely shakes up the game. Would only use the expansion with experienced players who have grown tired of the based game. Still trying to evaluate how to determine the 'value' of the various tiles, esp in relation to each other.

Puerto Rico is a lot of fun! I really like how all of the actions are not available every round, and so your strategy is constantly adjusting to what is available. There is a very good depth of strategy and though it is a meatier game, it's not so overwhelming that it scares off newer players. Great game!

I've gotten good enough at this that I usually do fairly well, but it's far from my favorite game.  With experienced players there's a lot of group-think -- the price of success, I guess!  It's hard for me to pinpoint exactly what's missing for me, but I just don't get excited about this game.

Chaque joueur possede un plateau de jeu qui représente son domaine sur lequel il va pouvoir construire des batiments ou placer des plantations et les activer au moyen de colons.

Un joueur est désigné comme Gouverneur. Tous les joueurs recoivent un peu d'argent au début ainsi qu'une plantation en fonction de leur position. 
En commencant par le Gouverneur, chaque joueur va choisir un role définissant une action a résoudre (que tous les joueurs vont pouvoir réaliser en commencant par celui qui a choisi le rôle) et un privilege (seulement pour celui qui a sélectionné le role)

RATING: 10
Yes, this game offers the ultimate enjoyment with theme, strategy, variation, and balance when players are of equal experience. Absolutely top-notch. The higher learning curve makes games more one-sided with beginners, so it doesn't come out near as often as it should and keeps it from being a perfect 10. Very engaging, trying to decide how to optimize that choice of which role to choose, while also trying not to provide an advantage to your opponent. Timing the shipping role, when to trade, produce, and build at the optimal time challenges the players every turn. The various roles and their actions are wonderfully woven together. This game should provide scores of exciting and compelling gaming experiences.
Includes New Buildings expansion.

I only played it twice. But I did not really like it. I admire the mechanics, and the multiple choices, and the tension of never quite being able to do all you want. Somehow, I just don't really enjoy playing it, and I don't look forward to playing it. Cameron does not like it either.

RATING: 8
This is a very good game, and definitely deserving of its accolades ... but it doesn't get a [10] from me.  The thing I like best about this game is that there is no downtime between player turns; everyone is fully involved, all of the time.  However, there are certainly a few drawbacks to the game for me.  After a few plays, various players' favourite strategies become a little predictable (but only a little; the extreme variety of options at every turn does make for a lot of permutations!).  Also, the building strategy seems to be far too dominant; it wins before shipping gets a chance to develop.  And the bonus VPs from large buildings seem always to be the clincher; if they were the same (physical) size as all the other buildings, then the building strategy would need a couple more turns to declare the end-game condition, giving those who are shipping a chance to collect a few more VPs.

I think this is a good game, but not great. Often felt like multiplayer chess, which sometimes is just not exciting enough. Very vulnerable to sub-optimal play by one or more players. Never take the producer role and you'll do well.

The more I play, the more boring the game gets. The factory is much more efficient to every other strategy. Rating revised down.

A well balanced game. What-you-do, everybody-else-does-too is part of the genius of this game.

Does not have the best replaybility as the game can quickly get formulaic and make you feel like a shipping clerk.

RATING: 10
For me, this game is the epitome of a euro game. There are so many ways of indirect player interaction, there are multiple strategies, every decision seems both non-obvious and important, yet it isn't too dry or too math-y.

I love the role drafting, where every player gets to do the action of the chosen role, and the one who chooses gets an extra benefit. I love the open building market with limited supply which creates a race for highly demanded buildings (especially the 10-cost buildings). I love how the trader only accepts one resource of a kind, making it important what your neighbors are planting. And I love how you can force everyone to sell their resources with the captain, making the timing of the role selection critical. There really isn't anything that I don't like in this game, which is something I can say about very few games.

My favorite game ever. I get sick sometimes of luck and dice, and this game never stops amazing me. It is pretty easy to teach, and people usually have it down by part way through the first game, but the strategies are complex and neverending. I never seem to win, but I still crave it. I think that is  a great sign of a game.

An excellent game, the wealth of strategies available make it a solid challenge. There's almost no random factors, you just have to second guess your opponents and try to calculate how best to turn the variable turn structure to your advantage.

My congenital distaste for all things popular notwithstanding, Puerto Rico's still at the top of my list.  Despite the depth, it's been a hit with lighter-gaming friends.

3, 4 and 5 player games are all quite different due to how often your turn comes. The nearly total information makes this quite calculable, which for me is pretty awesome. The big problem though is that if there's a bad player they might gift the win to the player to their left.

After some recent plays I've started to think that it loses some replayability with age, it could have used some variety in its setup.

I've only played it twice and I already want to buy it! Apparently the whole world likes it, so I don't really need to say too much. It has cool mechanics and multiple ways to win which will keep it interesting I'm sure. This game will earn a 10 rating pretty easily if it can sustain the enjoyment I have gotten so far after repeated game play.

*Update*

After 15 plays the game is still a solid 9 althought it is not as replayable as Settlers.

RATING: 7
Used to think this was nearly perfect.  Repeated play (too much, maybe), and the effects of playing with players of variable skills levels -- something I LIKE to do -- have caused it to drop dramatically for me.  Still a better game than my rating would indicate, but I no longer go out of my way to seek it out.  Perhaps absence will eventually make the heart grow fonder.  (NOTE: online play not recorded, plus most of my play took place before I started logging.)

Update: My respect for the game is returning, but I'm still hesitant to play.  I won't say no if it's what people want to play, but I won't seek it out, and I won't feel any enthusiasm.  It's a shame; it's a better game than that.  I just burnt out on it.  Lesson learned; I work at not overplaying games any more.

Update 5/2012: Have finally reached the point where I don't run from this.  I'm even playing a bit better (except on BSW, where my lack of practice with the interface makes me screw up repeatedly.)  It's still my poster child for overplaying, though.

I have also learned that careful explanation can really help mitigate the newbie issue, at least with bright players.

Top-tier game for the hard-core gamer out there.  Characteristic of the most highly rated games there are no dice or luck factors in the game.  Conversely it only takes a single bad player to really ruin this game as the mistakes a player can make always benefit/hurt the other players in an unbalanced way and the margin for error in this game is pretty small.  I rarely play this game live due to needing the right group of folks, but play on BSW a good amount where you can usually find solid opponents.  Think it plays better with 3 or 4 players than 5.

  An absolutley pure gamers game in the best sense and at a medium weight to boot!  The occasional criticism of it being "multi-person solitaire" is made by the lazy player.  There are multiple 'opening' moves (as in chess) that can become routine and may lead to a good position in the middle game, but a great player will smoke them.  This game can be incredibly deep.  I don't always play it that way, but I love that I can if I'm in the mood. 
  It gets a nine for the long set-up time (10-15 min).  I can knock out a game of the PC version in that time however the AI is pathetic.

Amazing game. Heavy player interaction, thought-provoking decisions, simple rules, and some of the most elegant mechanics in any game. The fact that your role selection affects everyone else so profoundly is what makes the game so engaging, and so deep. 

After my first few plays, I thought the game was starting to get "samey," and I REALLY hated the slave thing. I got over the slaves because 1) the theme is so abstracted that it's impossible to consider anything "historical" at all, and 2) the colonists aren't slaves if they're also running the markets, university, city hall, etc. 

As for "samey," the more you play, the deeper the game gets. You begin to realize things about the game you never thought of initially, and you start to see chains of reactions that extend 3 or 4 turns in advance. It's this amazing depth that makes PR really stand out from other Euros.

This game is ok. It's a solid enough game; it's just kind of dated now, and doesn't see a lot of table time anymore. I won't trade it away for now, but it's probably going to continue just taking up space on the game shelf rather than actually getting played.

After one play... all right, $%#damn it... I love it, just like I was afraid I would.  What a deep engine for a seemingly simple game.  --- Dropped rating because, after three years, I have very little interest in playing it.  I have no idea why.

UPDATE:  You know, I just never bothered playing this game again.  It has been years, and I just have no interest.

UPDATE II:  I have now played this game about six times face-to-face and maybe another ten times on PC.  It's fine, but that's it.  The people I know who tend to really like this game are people who aren't playing games for the same reasons I am.  The more luckless the game is, the less interesting it is if it goes beyond 30-45 minutes.  Prefer Chicago Express to PR if I want to go low-luck and analyze after.

The dependency upon having similarly skilled players is a major turnoff.  The roles feel like they are of too limited use (many aren't very good/useful/you shouldn't use them most of the time), in comparison to Race for the Galaxy, which I really enjoy.  I don't see this hitting the table with my family anytime soon either.

This game is quite good, but I have to be in the right mood for it because (1) it's stressful; (2) I have no idea about "opening" strategies, which are wide open (though my moves in the end are much easier to calculate). I'm certain this score will improve with time. UPDATE: As predicted, the third play was fantastic and tense. UPDATE2: This game does make me incredibly nervous -- it's not brain-burning, as such, but a lot of times the moves you do will help your opponent more than they help you, and then you start reasoning back to figure out how to avoid that situation. Argh.

Great game at first, but after a while, it just wasn't as fun to bring out anymore. Tedious setup, and gameplay is nearly silent while players brood over the choices in front of them. I really like the mechanics of them game, but each time my friends and I play, it devolves into 1) "Who has corn?" 2) Proceed to screw the corn player by getting some corn of your own (otherwise, it's a good bet he/she will win,) and 3) Buy a small market before they're gone! Each of our games starts out something like this, and for the rest of the game, we just go through the motions of building, trading, shipping, etc. Not all that fun. The final count-up of victory points can be a tense moment if you put a lot of effort and thought into your choices, but usually the end feels rather anti-climactic.

RATING: 8
Puerto Rico is a very good game, but it doesn't quite have the legs some other classics have, simply because it's not very tolerant of players of unequal skill levels.  This game can easily be thrown to an opponent by just a few misplays by someone else, and you can't do anything about it.  But with a group of similarly skilled players, it's quite good.  It also feels a bit "samey" in that the games tend to blend in with one another.  Still head and shoulders above most other games.

Played this again for the first time in many years and was reminded that it is both better and not as good as I remember. It's a very clever and interesting game, but also more chaotic than it looks, and over-analysis and over-competitiveness can completely ruin the enjoyment. Of the whole genre of games that Puerto Rico has spawned, from Caylus through Agricola, it remains by far the best (setting aside San Juan and Race for the Galaxy, which I sort of think of as a separate genre). But, unlike the best Knizia games like Tigris & Euphrates, Modern Art, or Beowulf, Puerto Rico just isn't infinitely replayable. It falls into patterns, and just doesn't vary enough from game to game. No hidden information, the only variation is through the flow of plantations ... not good enough. It's still a fine game which I enjoy, but it needed more variability to be a true classic.

Which is one reason I really like the new expansion from the alea treasure chest, with the Aristocrats. It seems to mix things up better than the first expansion did, better balanced and more open. It was fun to play again, especially with 5 (which I think is substantially the optimal number).
---
First, I find I must be the bad guy again and put a stop to this "greatest game ever" talk. Puerto Rico is an excellent game, no question. Amongst the best. That said, it does lack the true elegance of the top-10 types - the simplicity and tension of Modern Art, the simplicity and fun factor of Settlers or Starfarers, or simplicity and the variability without imbalance of El Grande. And in truth, I like Traders of Genoa more, because it has the same wealth of options with more player interaction and without the problem of knocking out players who get behind the power curve early. Still, all this said, Puerto Rico is an excellent game, up to Alea's remarkably high standards and in fact one of the best in the line. Several paths to victory are apparent, and none seem dominant. The game plays *very* fast, as is pretty unforgiving for a German game; mistakes in the first few rounds can and will cost you the game. Fortunately, it's still an engaging game even if you aren't winning, and the actual winner is often a surprise (since there is somthing of a "hose the leader" element, you want to be careful). Anyway, the only systemic weakness for me is that the game is rather light on player interaction & variability from game to game. These same problems weakened Princes of Florence in the long run - every game is essentially the same. The starting conditions are the same each game and there isn't much variability inherent in the system, unlike in Ra or Traders of Genoa. Still a very solid and interesting game, but one that played itself out sooner than one might hope, unlike the true classics (Settlers, Modern Art, etc.), and much as Princes of Florence did (although not quite that fast). Still highly recommended, and the Alea brand remains my favorite for serious games (whatever happened to Hans im Gluck? they seem to have moved down-market).

RATING: 8
What can I say that hasn't been said. If you like Euros, you will almost certainly like this. 2 basic strategies (building and shipping), but enough variation within those (plus the fact that which one is "best" is going to be heavily dependent on what the opponents on your left and right are doing) to keep the game entertaining.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I realize that most people who consider themselves serious boardgamers would rate this game a 9 or a 10, but I've got to give it more reasonable 7.5.  Puerto Rico is an excellent game with layers of strategy that unfold like the petals of a blossoming lotus.  Nevertheless, there are many small components, and the complex rules are further mystified by a poorly translated rule book.  There's limited player interaction, and some of the buildings seem nearly useless (the University?).  These factors contribute to the relative lack of play that this game gets from my group, but when we do play, there's no doubts about the greatness of PR.  If your gaming group prizes strategic multiplicity, you should pick up a copy of this game and let the brain-burning begin.

A very very good economy/point engine game, and probably one of the first ancestors of this type of game where you have so many options and strategies to potentially pursue.

On your turn, you select a role, which you do followed by all the other players.  You just get to do a slightly better version of the action as your reward for choosing it.  Roles do things such as make you money, buy buildings (which you need money for and give you special abilities), generate goods, sell goods, ship goods (which scores you points), etc.  Basically, they allow avenues for you to build up your money and victory point engines.

One of the criticisms I often hear about Puerto Rico is that differences in player skill level can make this one difficult to play and enjoy.  It's true that other players making dumb decisions can kind of rain on your parade inadvertently, but if you don't want other peoples' decisions to matter, you probably shouldn't be playing games.  I'll still agree it's more enjoyable if all players are around the same skill level, though.

Updated 6/16/10. 

Puerto Rico is a very enjoyable game, and the perfect step up from something like Catan.  The strategies are obvious enough to be graspable by new players, but with enough variability to lead to mastery.  With players who know the rules, it's quick, fun, and can often be cutthroat.  It really deserves to be a regular in any gaming group's rotation.   

The game has its downsides, however, which prevent the rating from going any higher (and, in fact, have lost it points regularly): (1) The theme is a bit dry.  It feels more mechanical than intuitive, and labels like "Quarry" and "Hacienda" feel too disconnected from the function of the thing they designate.  (2) Set-up is a bit of a chore.  (3) Without regular play, our group falls into default strategies (e.g., Tony is always doing the most shipping and invariably owns his own wharf; I go construction hut early, but usually run out of cash; Jenn buys markets and trades like the dickens).  Because we don't play it very often, we haven't "solved" it yet; but the comments of others suggest that this could be a potential problem for long-term playability.

I finally moved my rating down to an 8 when I rejected a very reasonable trade offer for this game, and it dawned on me that it is not something that I ever feel the need to own.  It's a very good, very enjoyable game.  But just one lacking the intrigue, the challenge, the soul of an elite game.

Each decision that you make affects other players in a way I've seen in few other games. Many times, the effect isn't even negative! If you want to build, everyone gets to build. If you want to harvest crops, everyone gets to harvest. Easily the most balanced game I've ever played. You win this game by having a superior strategy to your opponents. Luck plays virtually no role.

This game really complex.  I don't I fully understand the strategies for this game.

-- Update --  This is one of first game I got and really did not grasp the strategy.  I have played PBW and on the PC and finally enjoying the game.  Setup should be streamlined because I would play this more than San Juan if setup was easier. 7.5 to now 8.5


-- Update -- It is a 9

-- Update -- It is a 10
One of the most played games that I because it is availble as play-by-web by pr-game.com and a licensed PC version by Dartmoor.  The fun is trying  to figure out different paths of victory.  San Juan is still a better game because it is more elegant.

This game is nice in that there are multiple paths to victory and no clear "best" strategy.  People might feel overwhelmed by the rules at first, but they generally catch on by the middle of the first game.  The game is just so-so on the fun front, but it can be terribly addictive.

The more I play it the more I enjoy it.
Good thing is that the rules are simple, and the game is enjoyable from the first game.
Also no downtime at all!
I like the "building an engine" mechanism.
I love the fact that it can be played in one hour, and that I pulled out a succeful strategy from the university!
It a shame that it suffers some drawbacks, like too expensive buildings (so underused, can be easily fixed it seems), and the possibility of favorizing the player to your left, which make the game less elegant.
Can be played in less than 1 hour with 3, 1h30 max with 5.

Thank You BGG for introducing me to the possibilities of "real" board games.  I have owned several in the past but after stumbling upon BGG I found out what real boardgaming is all about when I read the Reviews for this game.  I Quickly bought it and my free time will never be spent the same again.  It's a great game I can't rate 10 yet because I'm still not sure what a 10 means to me.  Only complaint: buildings could be miniatures or better looking tiles.  Oh well.

Underwhelming game perhaps due to playing it long after hearing all the hype surrounding it. It is definitely a good game and I like the mechanism of each player selecting a role and other players getting a less powerful action of the same role. My main complaint is that there is no variability from game to game and therefore I feel like the game is a bit scripted as far as optimal moves go. Perhaps if different buildings were used each game I find Puerto Rico to be a bit more interesting.

Well, well, my earlier comments apparently got deleted in the effort to reduce the volume of PR comments. So my verdict in brief:

A delightful boardgame classic. No wonder it is the closest common denominator on BGG. Yet it's not quite perfect considering that some building (do I hear "university"?!?) are underpowered.

IMO, together with In the Shadow of the Emperor, El Grande and Euphrates & Tigris the pinnacle of German gaming.

This game is a masterpiece among economic board games. Ingenious and unique mechanics makes it a legend and a model for other designers. Although since first edition passed several years and there is planty of new great games in this category, Puerto Rico is still fresh and entertaining. The edition could have been better, but despite that PR is still in the lead of my favorite games and i will always play it willingly. I am certain, this game is one of the few titles i will keep in my collection forever. 3-5 on box works well, but the variant for 2 is also excellent.

My wife loves this game, and I am excited there is a game she likes so much, but I just don't get it.  And from how she talks I know there will come a point where I will get it, and when I do it will be because there is only one possible "perfect" strategy and all I will be doing is moving through these moves every single time.  A huge blergh.  I may upgrade eventually. (went from 3 to 5 to 7 - may even go up a little more.  Will never be a 10 for me though).

Update.  Enjoying this game more as I play it.  As I get to understand the game more, and see its subtlety and nuances I am really upgrading.  I feel like it will level out at about 8 or 8.5 after a few more plays.  My wife is happy I am not complaining as much about playing this.

After finally playing Puerto Rico, I felt the roots of at least have a dozen other games in my collection in this game. Truly, a forerunner. And it still stands up to be a massively enjoyable experience, where you're building your own economy, and yet can massively shaft other players because of the variable phase order. Two thumbs up..and a half.

RATING: 8
This, for me, is how little luck multi-player games can be done right. Where our actions help or hinder others depending on the timing.

Which is the primary tension of the game, timing our actions (role selection and end game triggers), such that they help us the most, help others less, and ideally hinder others as well.

I appreciate that you have a strategy going in, but the actions and strategies of the other players will force you to modify the plan during the game.

On the problematic side, if someone refused to play this game because of how Puerto Rican plantations used slavery (first the Tainos, the natives of the island, and once they were wiped out by the Spanish, black Africans (branded on their foreheads to indicate ownership)), I would certainly understand and we would then go play something else.

Love the role system here - I was not surprised when it got stolen from so much. Overall this is a satisfying and well-crafted resource game, and I also really dig the need to use the different endgame conditions to your advantage - getting the game to end on YOUR terms is a large and interesting part of the strategy.

Update: After years of not playing it, I am downgrading this to a 7. Which is maybe a silly thing to do, but this is a desire-to-play rating, rather than strictly reflection of competent design. I suspect if I played this right now, I would find it wholly engaging throughout... but I think it lacks a kind of excitement or bite that makes something addictive for me (that most of my 8+s have).

I have played enough Euro games to say to myself that I don't have to defend this game anymore.  This is a fantastic design, don't get me wrong.  The only problem is that it has worn out its welcome for me.  It just really isn't that fun anymore.  I'm pretty good at it, but not great, and it is not a game that I want to be great at.  There are too many other games that have great mechanics, little luck, but are much funner to play.  Also, I am to the point (after 75 or so games) that I realize that I mail in most of my turns of this.  You get to the point that where there were once choices, there really aren't anymore.  And whoever sits to the left of the noob has a great shot at winning.  Sure, plenty of people out there can crush me at this game.  But that's fine....let them play a dry game with no fun if that is what they want to do.  I would rather play ItSotE, Power Grid or Princes of Florence...tense with more decisions than you can shake a stick at....and they never get old.

26 - how else could i rate THE NUMBER #1 GAME OF ALL TIME!! Easy to learn, hard to master.  I love the fact that I can play the game with a different core strategy every time and have varying success dependent on my opponents and my position in relation to theirs.  If there's ever the opportunity to play the game, I would take it in a heartbeat.  The only drawback is the setup and cleanup.

RATING: 10
To me the most versatile game ever. 

It plays great at all players counts 2-5, with a very different feel at each number. 

The game is so intuitive that I have played this with complete non-gamers, and I still see it being played as a staple at 'lighter' gaming groups (this and power grid seem to be the step-up games of choice even over ten years later). On the other hand it is deep enough to reward very skilled play and remains interesting to gamers after hundreds of plays. 

It also seems to satisfy both gamers who like a lot of interaction and inter-player effects and those who like engine building resource management games. 

I personally love how every move involves both offense and defense -playing well demands determining what others need and what actions they are likely to take in upcoming rounds. It's the only game I have ever played that actually has the feel of building a company in a competitive economy.

[u]October 2008:[/u] After a long moment when I wanted to play other stuff (newer stuff), I find myself wanting to go back to this one and play again.

[u]December 09:[/u] Puerto Rico is a classic. It's also one of my oldest game. Although this game was what created my game group (it was both Vincent and Hadrien first games with Matthieu and I). I can't say it is one of my favourites. I've always had a hard time playing it and can't really get in it competitively. To me this feels like a stroll in the park and I can't get myself to really ponder my moves adequately.

A nice game that I enjoy playing but not one that I would really request at any time. I usually prefer playing other games like Imperial or Maharaja.

[u]March 2010:[/u] [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/497399/multiple-player-review-puerto-rico]My review[/url]

[u]December 2010:[/u] Changed my rating system, the game is now rated 7

RATING: 10
Hideously ugly, but absolutely great. Good for both new and experienced players, even at the same time. Players getting annoyed at noobs is a problem with the players, not the game. So there.
 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Puerto Rico is definitely one of my favorite games with almost NO luck involved - therefore, I give it an almost perfect rating! 

Sure, there is "luck" involved in who is the first player and the positions you sit in, and if you sit right after the only new player in the game you have a better chance to win as the new player will probably take craftsman more than other players... Besides that, the only luck is which plantations turn up - and that is such a little amount of luck that it has almost no impact on the game. 

However, it’s obviously not only because of the lack of hidden information and luck that I like this game a lot; otherwise I would like games like Chess and Through the Desert much more. 

In Puerto Rico, you need to have a good strategy but also be able to adapt to changes and make some tactical moves when the other players screw you. I really like that you can force people to ship when taking the captain when they hoped to trade their coffee/tobacco, and, in general, the roles are such a great mechanic! You need to think about which one to choose, and even though you e.g. don’t have any goods to trade, it can be wise to actually pick the trader in order to avoid the other players from getting it with even more coins on it so they will benefit a lot for choosing that role. You really have to consider not always picking the role which will benefit you the most but also which role will benefit the others the least – that’s the key to victory.

Regarding the key to victory, there are two main strategies in this game: the shipping and the building strategies. I think they are pretty balanced and I’ve won with both and lost against both. The success depends on the number of players, the interaction and what strategies the other players choose. Of course you can mix the two strategies, and obviously you need to ship even when you’re using the building strategy and build when you’re using the shipping strategy. The game could perhaps be a little boring after several plays exactly because of the lack of variables/luck and the two strategies, but the various buildings and especially the buildings of the expansion and how they interact help the game never getting old and boring!

This is truly one of the greatest games ever created!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A clever and highly original design but the choices often feel rather obvious. THE most obvious being to invite the new player to sit on your right! I prefer Cuba to this one because there is so much more going on though Puerto Rico is a excellent introduction to role selection and eurogames in general.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I was worried going in to it because I had read so much about lack of player interaction, but I would have to disagree with that assessment. I found the player interaction to be crucial to the balance of the game. No, its not attack this guys army with your army and knock him out of the game interaction, but there is definitely interaction.

RATING: 6.8
I won my first game (vs one experienced player who tended to win everything we played + three new players) and that normally disposes me towards a game. That's about the only thing I really remember about it. At time of writing (Jan 2010) I haven't played it in over 18 months, maybe more than two years. I've played it about half a dozsen times and I don't miss it. Nothing really grabbed me about the game and I only played it since that was what was on offer. I guess any game that involves skill and doesn't have handicaps doesn't go down well with me.

RATING: 6.5
Another one of those top games on BGG. But it never really delivered for me. If I have to chose from PR, Agricola and Caylus, I would always chose Caylus by far. So the other two are leaving.
Not a bad game for sure, but rarely hits the table.

RATING: 9
I've only played this a few times and I enjoy it, but I'm split. The competitive side of me salivates at this and wants to learn the optimization strategies. The fun side of me wants to turn away from the articles on play and practicing on BSW and just discover the fun within the group. I think the 'Just enjoy it' and 'Oh, nice bits' side is winning.

UPDATE Fall 2008: I set this aside for a while and recently came back to it---it blew me away this time. As I learned to teach the game better I got a better return on my opponents involvement and we started to feel the total immersion and paths to victory. Raised from a 7 to a solid 9. Found the right crowd! Only thing keeping it from going higher is that I have become somewhat locked in on a strategy that is tending to always work with my group. Since no one in my group is likely to go all serious/academic about it and push their play I keep falling into the same patterns with my play. I will have to break out of that approach to keep this fresh.

2010: Update, no one put the effort into really learning the shipping/corn strategy and we moved on. People liked the casual variability of Stone Age much more.

Have now had a chance to play this game multiple times, and it is fun every time.  An excellent game, and very deserving of its rating.

Excellent mechanics, well-crafted game play, and I have yet to suffer from the "you're sitting in the wrong spot" conundrum that seems to permeate this game at times.

Addendum to my original comments:  A new strategy for me, as played by my opponent in the last game that thouroughly kicked my keister (scoring a whopping 64VP in a 4 player game).  Anyway, I like the fact that there are so many different strategy builds that can win this game, and not one strategy that is overwhelmingly better than any other.  One guy at the last game said that playing the "Hospice" first is a guaranteed victory, but I disagree - obviously, I tried that strategy, and lost.  This game gets better and better as I play, and I am very impressed with everything about it.

OH!   That's what all the hype is about. Superb game with a unique flow. Time / game length are often a factor, so it doesn't get pulled out as often as I want... 

We use replica Spanish coins (Reales, Escudos, Dubloons, Pieces of Eight..) instead of the whimpy little 1's and 5's markers. The weight and sound of the coins adds SOOO much to the game. The coins are also used in a variety of other games we play.

Should be higher, but I can't get people to play it enough and, truth be told, I think I'd rather play PG or PoF with 5 players and Settlers with 4.

Almost everything I read about this game strikes me as wrong.  After several plays, I don't think it's terribly well designed or balanced.  If you're player A, you might well lose the game because player B fails to choose the role that most limits player C.  No well-designed game has this attribute.  It/s also a bit awkward and clunky, any elegance in the game's basic choose-a-role mechanism lost amid the zillion special privileges and building-based special-powers.  I have it at "7" now because it's reasonably engrossing on a tactical level, but I suspect it's going to keep dropping.  I don't think this is all subjective anymore, I now believe the game has some serious, objective problems.

Wow. Great game. I can see where some people might find this too analytical, but I really enjoyed my first game. After one play, I find myself thinking about different strategies. I expect I'll add this one at some point.

This could be a lot of fun as long as I don't play with people who are ultra-competitive.

Update: bought it after my first play. Now, I face the challenge of finding people to play this locally.

Another update: busted this out on a game night with two other couples, and it went over very well. For anyone even slightly beyond "the gateways," this game is very accessible despite its reputation for heaviness.

Update: Hadn't played this game in a while, as my exhuberance in this hobby led to a flurry of new games. Finally revisited Puerto Rico for a third play, and after buying about 45+ other games, it is still dang good. Slick as heck, plenty of strategic choices, smooth elegant game play. The only thing that shows its age is the subpar, underwhelming game components. Other than that, it's a game everyone should try at least once.

Update: again, another long gap between plays, but this still holds up. This game offers things I particularly enjoy in games: reasonable playing time, some flow and rhythm to the game, and relatively simple choices (choose a role!) with numerous consequences. It's no wonder this is a classic.

Update: OK, traded this away in a math trade, but only because I upgraded to the 10th Anniversary edition.

RATING: 8
A classic, though I somehow evaded playing this game until 2005.  As with many games of its general German ilk, there's no one set strategy to win, especially with larger games in which buildings get sold out very quickly, which makes a willingness to adopt new strategies key.  This is best played with players of roughly the same experience with the game, of course.

Although I like this game, I'm not in a rush to pick it up since so many people have it.

Puerto Rico is a very well designed game. We usually play only two player games, so we have not had a chance to try this one with more players.

The family favourite; after 4-5 plays everyone feels confident and plays become much quicker (60 min) and aggressive.
Be sure to have a veteran player to teach any newbie in his first 2-3 plays though.

Very beautiful game, with an excellent balance between "weight" and duration of play. I can't recommend it enough.

(Reason it is in my wishlist is that i do not own it but instead i "protect" my brother-in-law's copy of the game, and i have been taking care of it for years...)

I had rated this a 10, but the fact that seating order can influence the game SO much (specifically, if you're sitting next to a really bad player, you basically win) knocks it down a point.  If you play with equal-skilled players, it's a "10".

This is by far the best game I have played in a very long time, if by a long time I mean ever. Although I own other great games, this one was so well designed and thought out that it has no luck value involved at all. Like chess you have to think about your opponent's moves and what will help you most while not helping your opponent. A fantastic game that will be played many times.

Efficiency engine games don't tend to do it for me, but my first play of this classic was a very pleasant surprise. The engine building is complemented with a heavy dose of tactical setup. Getting in-phase with the game seems critical. Manipulating the phase seems ideal. In this way, it feels oddly similar to Container. While they are entirely dissimilar as 'economic' games, they have a common 'feel'. I look forward to more plays - learning the buildings better, getting more comfortable with the roles, and starting to pay more attention to the other player tableaus. I can imagine that the lookahead in the game can be quite interesting. On another note: San Juan is one of my most played games and I expected PR to feel more similar than it did. As much as I love SJ for nostalgia reasons, PR felt like the much better game. No surprise there, I suppose. (Note: My rating of SJ will continue to reflect nostalgia.)

RATING: 7
It's a great game with very small amount of radomness and many ways to victory. There are many strategies that you can try and every game is different, because you never know, which strategy will opponents choose. And it's good for two players too. 
The only flaw I can find is that Puerto Rico may seem a little abstract and "dry" - theme of the game is not very thrilling and there is more cold logic in that game than hot emotions. 
It's the best with five players.

No thanks.  Not interested.  I won't make the mistake of playing it again.  I do not like economic snowball games.  This is not to say it is a bad game, just that it is a game which specialises in things I don't like and am not interested in.  This is a game that is clearly a member of the "I'd rather go home alone in the dark than play this game again" set.  The very strong right/left binding does nothing but ensure this game is strenuously avoided.  

The economic snowball aspects are accompanied by so little non-mechanical player interaction that any chance of being interesting are forever lost.  The fact that the game tends to break when played by players of unequal skill and relies heavily on the right/left mechanics (keep the player on your left down/from winning) pretty much seals its fate for me.

A well balanced game with deceptively deep strategies.  Despite many comments I've read, I truly don't believe there is any one strategy (i.e., harbor, corn shipper, etc) that is better at the outset than any other.  Playing Puerto Rico well consists of keeping an open mind and looking for opportunities as they develop.  Play is slightly on the complex side for the German style games (i.e., Carcassone, Settlers, Adel Verpflichtet), but still very manageable.  Princes of Florence is still my favorite of the Alea line, however.  

UPDATE:  I think, some of the analysis, as well as the theme, has lessened the game in my eyes.  It hasn't been played by my group in quite a while, and it probably won't be any time soon.  Not exactly ready to give up on it, though.

UPDATE: Puerto Rico is a decent game, but for the Euro experience I prefer Agricola or even Princes of Florence.

:sugar: :( :what: :) :D :) Puerto Rico is a fine, even laudable game -- I would define it as sitting on the borderline between the super-popular gateway games and the heavier gamer's games. If PR makes sense to you and doesn't feel overwhelming and is actually fun, you're a good candidate for the heavy stuff. If not, you're probably not. The main thing that keeps this one in the "games I like" category and not the "games I love" category is this: it's a bit [i]brittle[/i], with the best moves being somewhat common knowledge amongst experienced players and not being obvious to new players, which makes games of PR between people of differing skill levels dicey, but not in an interesting way.

I don't think it is the best game ever - and at times wonder why it is rated number one.  But all in all it has never failed to offer an excellent and interesting 90 minutes.

boring artwork, boring and predictable gameplay, boring watching the leading player win for the next 30 minutes (feels like 2 hours). And the quality of the components also isn't really good.

If someone leads after the first two rounds, the other players can watch him win for the rest of the game. No chance to make up the point difference.. only if the leader makes a really bad mistake... 

Can't understand the high rating.

Fantastic game for it's time where the players compete about building up the most prosperous colony and send merchandise back to their countries and make as good a profit as possible.
This is a landmark game that have helped the hobby along a great way.
The mechanics in this game have been used by many others but have then also added other chrome to their games. Puerto Rico is arguably the most refined of the games in this genre.
The simple rules but complex interactions have made this game popular among many others than the usual gamer crowd.
One side of the game that some have problems with is that to develop your colony you are using slaves as workers in the colonies.

I picked this up on a whim when I found it on a deep sale. This is probably the most complex game I have, and it's interesting, because the rules are pretty straightforward and simple to understand once you go through it once or twice. The depth and complexity is readily apparent after that, and I can easily see why it's been in the BGG top 10 for so long.

After primarily playing it with the official 2p variant, I tried it out with 3p, and it almost feels like a completely different game. Lots of different strategies open up, and the potential to snatch up paths to victory from other players is increased. The game is also much longer, but that's not a terrible thing. Just something to keep in mind. Still a great game.

I almost feel like there's not much more praise that could be given to Puerto Rico than it's already received (with 30k ratings and 8k comments at the time of this writing), but here goes!

Puerto Rico is probably the best game I own and have played. I would never turn down an opportunity to play it. Thousands of people on the Geek have already sung this game's praises, so I'll just mention a few things that I love about Puerto Rico.

First, once you get to know the game, Puerto Rico is fast-moving and keeps every player involved. There is very little downtime in the game, and when there is you can be planning out your next move. Every player's action choice affects the other players in important ways, and the game almost never leaves you feeling left out of the action.

Which brings me to my second point, and one of the things I really love about the game. Unlike many other Euros, Puerto Rico is thick with player interaction in all kinds of subtle ways. While there aren't a lot of opportunities to directly mess with the other players, you always need to be thinking about how what you do will help or hurt them. Choosing the right action at the right time can bring you major benefits even as it hurts your opponents.

While every player is, in some sense, "tending their own garden," Puerto Rico forces you to constantly consider how your choices will help or hurt opponents.

Other than that, Puerto Rico is also packed with different ways to win. Every time I play the game, I feel like I discover something new about what works and what doesn't, and it always creates a new and wonderful experience.

While this may not be the best game for the casual crowd, it moves very quickly and smoothly once the game gets going. I've explained this game to people with almost no board game experience, and they've snapped it up and jumped right into it right away.

Puerto Rico is one of the best games I've ever played, and I would recommend it with no hesitation to anyone.

What I personally admire about PR is that there is virtually no down time and there is a steady menu of interesting decisions.  There are certainly a LOT of viable strategies.

In 2002, this game would have been the bee's knees. Today, it's still pretty darn good. From a strategy standpoint, it's hard to find fault. The role selection and the associated bonuses force players to make all kinds of interesting decisions. I'd likely rate this a 9.5 if strategy were the only consideration. However, factor in that the game's setup and tear-down take a long time, the components are of low quality, the game looks ugly, and it's a nightmare when playing with people prone to analysis paralysis. The best of today's games have a more pleasing aesthetic and higher quality components while playing equally as well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Puerto Rico is a very good game that deservedly has had not just a day in the sun, but rather, several years. The basic concept of this game, action selection is, in one sense, shades of everything that happened in the German game industry for the 5 years that followed its publication, as the tile selection that drives the game here is not far removed from the individual action selection that the workers represent in games like Caylus and Agricola.

PR is a heavily tactical game where 2 mainline strategies exist, one, scoring points by shipping goods, the other, scoring points by buying buildings, preferably the large, end game bonus buildings. Despite the fact that these are relatively known quantities, and have been for years, the game is still compelling.

Rating this game is difficult to do now. I haven't played it regularly in years. It was one of the earlier titles that I latched onto, and when I had less than 10 games, it got a hell of a lot of table-time, often 5+ games in a single session, all in a row. My group rapidly moved on to the expansion though, and crafted a building group that we thought was more interesting using many of those buildings though, and as a result, I can't rate the base game higher than 8, though it is a 10 when I can add in the buildings I like from the expansion.

Really though, if you haven't played this yet, and if you like Euros at all, then you should just go out and buy it. Seriously, buy it. The game is addictive in the early going, and as long as you avoid the plethora of strategy guides that were published over the years you should get double digit plays out of the base game before it starts to seem scripted, easily. A lot of the burnout talk that you see circulating here is fueled by the option of online play, which meant that some people were playing it literally in excess of 1000 times. Other than traditional games like Go and Chess, and perhaps card games like Tichu and Spades I don't know of any games that can stand up to that sort of rigour, so don't shy away from the title because of that. It is one of the most significant imports from Germany, period, and is justifiably recognized as a modern classic.

RATING: 7.5
2005 What a great game! All these decisions and a reasonable playing time.  My first German style game and what a revelation.

2006 I still really like this game but one of my regular opponents is starting to get too much deja vu and thinks the game forces people down similar paths each time. In a three player game you can win without the habour or the wharf but why would you try.

2007 I think we have developed favoured patterns but I still try to evolve my game by integrating what seems to work from my opponents game and trying out variations. Small changes seem to produce significant outcomes.

2007 We were obliterated at a convention it has put us off.

2013 This game needs to be played a lot to improve understanding since the relationship between player order, role choice, building types etc defies simple analysis.  When this was my only Euro game this was an option.  The deliberatly obtuse relationships between elements of the game do not float my boat any more.  Through the Ages, Power Grid and Race for The Galaxy cover this ground with mechanics that are easier to understand and I find it increasingly difficult to find the motvation to revisit this venerable and deliberately obtuse classic.

2014 Online play has softened my opinion of this game.

Don't play this.  It's awful.  I obviously slipped when I rated it.  The collective rating is obviously some sort of database error or the result of an endless parade of bandwagon raters and shill accounts owned by the same user.  I mean really, how could a game be as good as this game is rumored to be?  That couldn't possibly be true, right?

Likes: Of the top rated games, this one has relatively simple rules. It's relatively easy enough to learn, but has so many levels of depth and subtle effects based on other people's decisions. High player interaction, even if it is not obvious at first.

Dislikes: There really isn't much. Set up does take some time, but it's still pretty fast compared to some of the top rated games.

This is a big game. I love San Juan and this game is just the same game with more going on. Having played San Juan its was much easyer to understand and get into Puerto Rico. We didnt have time to play it in full the first time out but I think its a game that needs to be played a few times to really get the hang of it.

A turn-based, worker/tile placement game where you must think about what plantation you want to grow and what buildings you want to buy using income from the plantations. Got it as a gift and we cracked it open right away. Had a lot of fun playing this one. Instructions weren't that difficult to grasp and got the hang of some sort of strategy about 2-3 turns in. I would say it's easy enough to introduce to a beginner tabletopper.

I have played this game about 10 times as a 3-player game and a couple of times as a 4-player game.  I enjoy the different decisions you have to make in the game and the different paths to victory.  I also like that everyone is involved in each turn.  The learning curve wasn't that steep either although I imagine there will be a number of subtle tactics and strategies that I will pick up.  Of course, it helps that my wife (non-gamer coming around; impatient when it comes to games) loves this game as well.  The games have generally been close enough that anyone has a chance for victory.

I just bought this game so there may be more gaming opportunities!

Heavily slanted unfairness toward new players with so many buildings that affect game play.  Best to play with people of similar experience.  Wish there was a two-player mode, but we played one 2-player game with 2 boards each... very difficult to keep the empires separate though.

One of those rare cases where the opinions of the masses are right.  Almost.  I initially scoffed at this one due to its pretty boring theme (Puerto Rico? C'mon...)and its apparent complexity.  I bought it based on the reviews and haven't looked back since.  This is a beautiful, elegant game that plays kind of like other games but as whole is entirely unique, easy to play, and most important of all, FUN.  The depth of strategy Puerto Rico affords is unparalleled in German-style games and the constant need to adapt and assess other players' actions provides a deep yet subtle level of interaction beyond simple diplomacy, trading, or auctioning mechanisms.  This is truly a game not to be missed by anyone with so much as a casual interest in games but the disclaimer here is that it's not endlessly replayable- in fact, I think the game has about 20 plays before a nasty, hateful burnout sets in.  It's important, magnificently designed, and should be on any gamers' shelf but will I play it ever again?  Maybe not.  It was great while it lasted though.

Both the regular game and the expansion deserve 10's. I could play this everyday. I have won my share but still feel I have room for improvement. This is one game where its all about watching what everyone else is doing and reacting. So for me the player interaction is high. You must be like a football team and react to your opponents plays and abilities. You can't go out with the same game plan and expect to win.

I saw this at the local gaming store, and thought to myself, Hey Puerto Rico, I guess I'll pick it up, Hundreds of Geeks can't be wrong. I picked it up, got the ol' group together and played. Oh my god! This game *is* amazing. The first thing I would like to say about the game is that the rules are not complicated. This is what was originally stopping me from picking it up, I thought it was super complicated. It takes 10 minutes to explain it to a new player, and then you are up and running. Elegant play, trash talking, and very little random element. On each player's turn, every other player has something to do, so it keeps everyone interested. Usually in a game, I wait until I am done my turn, then run to the bathroom when I have to go. With this, I find myself waiting until my turn, because I don't want to miss anything. Solid good game people. Give it a try, although I am sure you already have.

Edit 12/14/07: Lowered the rating to reflect current feelings. This was one of my first purchases in the Euro/light strategy game universe, and I was very impressed. Before this game, I only played a lighter fare of western pop culture games. After considerable time owning it, I found that it just didn't hit the table all that much. More detailed review pending.

This rating has gone down since I don't get to play it very often. The resurgence of light FUN games has pushed this fine game off the table lately. The fact that I am usually teaching games to new gamers also effects the current fare.
Too dependant on similar skill levels to be much fun. Winning is too easily dependant on "bad" moves of another player. Too linear with serious lack of variety in how the game feels even if it is slightly different each time.

It would be interesting to undertake a sociological/ psychological research to find out why so many people rate this game 10.

No two games of Puerto Rico are exactly alike. The choices are different each time you play, and there are so many different strategies you can use that it would take quite awhile to exhaust them all.

Probably the best game I own.  Has a nice balance between complexity(heaviness) and accessibility for new players.  I have introduced this game to many of my friends and family members and it was an instant hit.  The best quality of Puerto Rico is its lack of randomness combined with a constant flux of variable strategies that unfold from turn to turn.  This keeps the gameplay infinitely fresh.  It even works well as a 2 player game with the rules variant.  It is the heaviest game that my wife will play with me.   I also like that when I lose a game I can usually determine which gameplay choices led to my defeat.  Although I don't ALWAYS want to play it, I can without reservation list it as my favorite game.

It's probably a better game than my rating.  Certainly, the mechanic of choosing a role that allows every player to do the action, with a slight advantage for the chooser, is pretty innovative (and cool).  But I find the theme (obtaining slaves - that is, colonists - to work your crops and erect buildings) pretty dry and not terribly interesting.  It's clearly a game where one could explore many different strategies and experience with the many possible combinations will lead to better play.  But that's not the main thing I'm looking for in a game.  Rather, I'm looking for drama and surprise and new ways of thinking.  If you like to go deeper into the analysis of your games, your rating will be higher.

Pretty good game, unless your turn is BEFORE the person who always picks craftsman or captain. Lots of different ways to play to try and get a victory. Easy to learn. Does not really live up to all the hype, but seems like a "comfort" game for some folks.

RATING: 8
Among my all-time favorites. Mechanics are parsed easily, players are kept involved, and it retains interest even after many playthroughs.

Downside? Very easy for players to play "kingmaker" once they're far enough off the pace.

This is a pretty good game, but not an excellent game. Craftsman is a weird character. If you want to have fun, please play with the players  familiar with this game. Otherwise, one might win just because another doing one stupid thing.

Puerto Rico has suffered from willful neglect on my behalf. When I first saw the game, I had only just begun playing boardgames, and the complexity went way over my head. I also disliked the fiddly bits (I have big hands). Over the years, I have done my best to avoid the game whenever possible, but there have been times when I was forced to sit down and play. The first thing that still strikes me is the apalling quality of the game material. This is an Alea big box, and it uses thin cardboard exclusively, and tiny wooden chits. The VP-system does not work, because VP are meant to be closed—why then is it necessary to make change from time to time...? On to the game, then. Actually, I like it, provided you play with fast players who don't think forever to make a decision. The mechanisms are polished, play is rythmical without becoming a Bolero-like excercise as is the case with Caylus, and the role-choosing with its extra privilege is intruiging. 

Nevertheless, there are downsides to this game. You absolutely need to have players of your own level to play against. Puerto Rico is a game of efficiency, and while you may not necessarily play bad on a single turn, better players do slightly better consistently on every turn. (This is discounting making really bad moves which help your opponents more than they help you.) They are able to do better because they have seen more strategies, and know what buildings will help them most. Consequently, I suspect there will come a definite moment where you are simply 'done' with the game. (I notice this in certain comments.) It is tantalisingly solvable and processional: I suspect a good portion of its (overrated) high notes stem from this fact. It's a good game if you're still learning the ropes, but excellent it is not. (Then again, I define excellent as 'I don't know what it is, but I'm sure I can recognise it when I see it.') Finally, but not really surprisingly, is that this game fails at 5 players. There is a nasty shortage of buildings in the game, and a few early decisions can completely lock one or two players out of the competition. I intensely dislike losing because the game point blank refuses to let me win; being able to correctly assess this situation 1/3rd through breaks the game to an uncomfortable degree for me. A game like Endeavor gets this aspect 'right', although I suspect that it is precisely the hard fight which draws some players to Puerto Rico.

[b]Update[/b] I seriously doubt Puerto Rico would have attained its nigh-legendary status had it appeared a decade later. I played it again since whenever, and found it boring and processional. I suppose that if you want to study the various effects of growth and timing of an artificial setting, Puerto Rico isn't such a bad choice as the amounts of money and resources aren't that large, thus keeping the analysis doable. But as a game, it's boring.

Sure, it's a good game, with novel mechanisms and subtle player interaction. But the sense of wonder and discovery has really faded after about 15 plays. There's a real issue with varying levels of experience, and even though you always have a lot of possible actions to take, it's often more or less obvious which one you should take.

I enjoy every play of this game. It moves quickly, allows you to follow through on strategies, and has a fun element of trying to predict what other players are going to do in order to formulate your own moves. Really the only consistent drawback to this game that I see is in teaching new players, the amount of text on the buildings can be tough to absorb. However, it's really not that bad to stumble through a game or two and pick it up.

For a long long time, Puerto Rico was my favorite game.  It still easily qualifies for top 10.  I love any game with role selection, and Puerto Rico is designed in such a way that optimal play depends on being able to predict what other players will do.  Because there are a variety of successful strategies, it's always fun to try to and balance your approach against what other players are trying to accomplish.  I also think PR solves the common problem of having nothing to do when other people are playing their turn with the everyone-acts-on-every-turn mechanic.

Played the great classic for the first time ever on Apr 22 2008 at John Morgan's place (3-player). I like it and I can now see where all the other games are stealing their mechanics/ideas from. Recognizing the differnt mechanics from other later games (RftG, San Juan, Amyitis, Caylus, etc.), I picked up the rules in about 5 minutes. This truly deserves its high rating, partly based on the time it was released. I want to play more to get a better feel for it.

Very fun; not hauled out much these days, but has had a lot of plays. Probably would have been a 9 in the past, but it's lost some of its shininess, and I really wish that a few of the buildings were priced more in line with how good they actually are.

(Way back in the day when we first started playing, I was a little disappointed at how little player interaction there was. Boy, was I wrong. Once you get beyond the "how do I make these pieces fit together?" level of play, an immense part of the game is about figuring out what other people are likely to do, and how your action assists or thwarts others. Unfortunately, it's finely balanced enough in this regard that there are some kingmaking issues - a slip on one player's part can give some other player a really big boost, and it will nearly always be the player just-downstream, which, sadly, makes "sit to the left of the less-experienced player" a notable advantage.)

RATING: 8
For many players the best game ever created. For me not bad, really tough, little bit dry and boring and too much dependent on how other players are playing. Only for experienced players, very difficult to explain rules (too many buildings).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Components: All bits are made of wood, and all tiles are a thick cardstock. I'd like the buildings better if they had thematic pictures on them, and/or if they were easier to read from across the table.


Experience: Having only played this game twice, many years apart, I am still lukewarm. The two main choices seem to be which role to choose, and which building, if any, to buy when the Builder is chosen. I enjoy puzzling through which role is best for me and least good for the others, but the buildings are so varied in their effects, that with only two playings under my belt much of the game is spent in confusion as to which structures are granting which powers to which players. With it fresh in my mind right now, I can see that I need to find more synergy with my choices, and better timing.

Here's an example of a game that is so beautifully balanced in its strategic elements, that the optimum strategy is nothing less elegant than maximizing your opportunity flexibility. I suspect some people (such as perfect plan fans) will hate that.  I, for one, think it's terrific.

If this games suffers from anything, it suffers from having simply been played too many times.  While every bit as much the same game it ever was, there are just too many other games out there for one played a hundred times or more to retain its original charm.

I don't know how Puerto Rico is ranked as high as it is. The game is okay for me. I've played it a couple of times and in both instances I'm still planning my game when it ends suddenly. It's a good game for learning how to pay attention to other peoples strategy.

[b]Thumbs Up[/b]: Objectively, it is a great design, and has proven to be so due to the many inferior games of a similar nature that have been released since. I do not really enjoy this style of efficiency engine game, but I admire the game so much when I play it that it becomes a positive experience.

Things I really like: The possibility of getting screwed during trading and shipping adds great tension to the game and really gives it its tactical depth; good strategic depth in the selection of which commodities to invest in; great fun when the Harbor gets going!

Things I really dislike: Fussy setup; fussy play; insufficient player interaction to offset the imbalances between the different buildings.

RATING: 8
One of those games where after you play, you want to play again immediately.  It takes a while to figure out the rhythm of the game (which is affected to a good degree by the group).  You cannot pick one fixed strategy, you must adapt to where you are in the rhythm.  Sometimes you should be a builder, sometimes a shipper, sometimes a 50/50 mix.  I've won by large margins with all three strategies.  If you love to build, but the rhythm dictates a non-building strategy you had better become a shipper for that game.  This frustrates people who like to make work out a fixed strategy and keep making incremental improvements to it over time.

Although I think I understand why some people should like this,I am a bit nonplussed as to all the lavish praise that seems to be given by others. I played it a few times when it first appeared, but while others could not seemingly get enough of it, it leaves me cold being a chore rather than fun. The only time it gets interesting is seemingly at about the time the game ends, but maybe that's just the anticipation of the imminent end of the torment.

Horrible learning curve. Incredibly anti-intuitive and badly flowing. UPDATE: played more & won. The most wrongly played game in the world. Suffers from "who is playing on my right" syndrome.  Stupid 'less choices per turn" mechanic. Lot's of fiddly bits help make it too long for set-up/teardown. Smoke and mirrors. 15 PAGES of geek rules questions. And these are just the OBJECTIVE criticisms. Just ask for more. It ain't number 1- Haven't seen it played anywhere in several years.

Also got my first game of this in on an iPad app version - and this is an EXCELLENT way to play - I'd imagine it shaves a good 30 - 45 mins. off of playtime vs. the cardboard version.  This game is interesting but I was taught by a veteran, hardcore player of the game. To be honest I am still entirely in the dark as to any real strategic approach to the game - I was buying everything totally blindly.  Game does feel like multiplayer solitaire as is so often commented, and after a while my teacher sailed past me in production and became more focused on scoring more than the computer opponents.  This left my first game a bit disappointing - I didn't really feel involved in the game due to not knowing what I was doing.  However I would definitely play this again - it definitely looks like there is a lot to mastering the game and I can't really appreciate it until the strategy "clicks" a bit more for me.

Numerous plays reveal I like the game. Some of its ancestors have topped it in different ways, and Puerto Rico can kind of become systematic with well-trodden paths to victory. A great game, of course, and with role selection quite innovative for its time. I'm happy to see Agricola bypass it.

An excellent "step two gateway game", alongside the Castles of Burgundy.

Fast, fun, & NO DICE!  This game of economic growth is outstanding.  It reminds me quite a bit of the old school video game "M.U.L.E." where players attempt to out produce their enemy by creating diverse resources.  It's probably impossible to confirm but I wouldn't be surprised if the creator of this game had played that video game classic.

Probably the strongest aspect of this game is that it is "simple to learn yet difficult to master".  The rule book is tiny compared to many advanced games.  I have seen 4 year olds play this game with 40 year olds and both enjoyed it very much.  That is sign of a quality crafted game.

RATING: 9.5
Amazing game, multi-dimensional. Definitely not 'solitare' like, but attacks against opponents are not directed. With two player variant can become chess like (in a bad way) where games follow predetermined openings to mid games. With 4-5 players this game is amazing. 2 year update. Even with 4-5 player, the games eventually becomes chess like with clearly 'correct' and 'incorrect' plays. Dropped from a 10.  This is really a 10 for the first 30 plays, but I have stopped calling for it to come to the table, unlike my other 10's. With the expansion now, I am interested again, and think it has very long term legs. 9.5...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
2-5 players, medium heavy, 90-120 minutes, city building

Having played numerous games, both offline and online, I can fairly say that this is my favourite game. Despite its age, I haven't come across more recent games that rival this one. 

This is a strategic game, there is no luck involved, but the rules are fairly easy once you understand the game mechanism. There are several routes to success and usually it stays exciting to the end who will win the game. For non-gamers this one can be quite difficult at first, but after one or two games people know the mechanism and the various roles and buildings and what they do. 

The games works quite well with 2, 3, 4 or 5 players, which I consider a bonus as not many games do. I'm a fan and want to play this again soon!

I'm hoping to get my hands on the limited edition at a decent price and otherwise consider replacing this one by the reprint, which also includes both expansions.

My first Eurogame.

It took a few rounds but by the time the governer changed, I felt I understood the basics.

Being able to 'indirectly' affect the opponents with nearly every decision meant I slowed the game down somewhat, weighing up the available decisions and I never felt I had time to mentally explore every option.

I imagine that after another game, I'll be familiar with the building roles, possible strategies and will finally be at a stage where I feel able to compete.

game 3:
This game has a lot of options you can try for at the start - the violet buildings, with unique abilities, really forcing you to take some time to plan your strategy. Somehow, it doesn't feel as overwhelming as Caylus. Maybe because only a few are purchasable at any time, minimising the starting building choice.

The final violets really 'suggest' strategies, hopefully pushing folk down different paths.

Though not very interactive, working out what a shipment/sale would result in and what buildings you need to grab before others are vital skills.

Easy to play but still has lots of strategy and tactics.

Only played with 3-4 players.

Some say this has no player interaction, but I like to snatch things other people want from the market place and tactically fill the boats (corn boat!) so that others won't have room for their produce.

I enjoy Puerto Rico alot. It's in the same style as Race for the Galaxy. It is very similar but very different. I really like the way it plays out.
I have only played with 2 players so I have yet to try out a game with more.

Edit: finally got to play with a minimum 3. Really enjoyed it. Definitely became a favorite with another play.

After playing this about 20 times, I'm starting to feel like it's a bit repetitive.  It's not full on robot mode, and the play by play afterward is still sweet, but there's something to the complaints people make about it.

Taking a break helps too. There's something to be said for setting a good game down for a couple months and playing it again.

Still enjoy after all these years. Yes, seating order can matter if playing with inexperienced people, but I'm playing to enjoy myself not to dominate. One of the few games where it seems like every choice you make can effect everyone else playing, which is why newbies can throw everything off. I also like that it feels at the end of the game like you have built something and made progress, even if you lose, unlike so many euros today (Stefan Feld, I'm looking at you).  

I have the deluxe version so traded away my regular set, which looks dull in comparison.

What can I say thats not been said. It's a very strong game with little reliance on luck and more reliance on choosing the right resources and buildings. But I cannot help feeling that it could have benefited from some better designed building tokens with some nice artwork. It's just a tad too textual on the cards. Maybe even little ships that you actually place he resources in. Others may think differently but that's just me, I'm a sucker for the visually pleasing.

RATING: 10
Excellent game, but quite difficult if you're stuck in linear thinking. You must manage your strategy in a non-linear progression. Although the game would seem to be a highly STRATEGIC game, it is in truth very TACTICAL instead. You can (and should) work on a long-term strategy, but you will be forced to respond tactically in ways that will most certainly change your strategy.

Eh.  It's too complex for casual gamers, and the choices of roles benefiting people selectively and incidentally makes it less suited to hard-core gamers.  But the game is still quite good.

RATING: 9.1
The decisive breakthrough in modern boardgames!

I knew this game many years after its launch (and after knowing other modern games), even so, i was absolutely delighted by that new concept: In his turn, a player should not only worry about making the best for him, he must also worry about making the less possible to benefit the others! This happens because an action choosen by a player affects also all the others. The actions less choosen then take credits to make them more appeal (an ideia later reproduced in other games).
Other cool ideias are the hidden victory points (making players unsure about finishing the game or not), the slot allocation of boats and the rules to force endgame (completation of player´s mat, and the run out of settlers or VP from the "bank").
There is not a straight strategy to win as, in different games, players may take different options, however,the most significant drawback of the game is that the player seated on the left of a newbie can get really benefit (on account of the new concept mentioned earlier that is hard to perceive at first), as the player´s turns always run clockwise and are not variable.

Doesn't get played or even suggested at all, so I traded it for Battlestar Galactica.

This is another game that I love more than any of my group of gaming friends do.  I would play this much more if I could find people to play that also enjoyed it.  My wife thinks it's too "bland and boring".  The fact that it is a minimum of 3 players helps keep it from the table (Race for the galaxy gets played quite a bit, thanks to that being a 2 player card version).  Read other reviews if you want more details from people who have been able to play more.  But, I do love this game - just don't get to play it as much as I would like.

After seeing this on a lot of top game lists, I finally got the opportunity to play. At first it took a bit to get the concept of the game, since none of us have played before,  but afterwards we had fun playing it. It seems like a cross between Dominion and Catan. I'd recommend at least playing  this game once and deciding if it's up your alley. The replay value seems high since there seems to be a lot of variety in each game.

I'm always hesitant to start a game of Puerto Rico but once I do, I have enjoyed the experience. The heart of the game is trying to set yourself up so that no matter what role is selected, you have a decent action. Shipping goods back is huge and you need to look early on to get that engine going. In my plays, the VP building tiles have not made that big of a difference in scoring. I have not played this at the lower player counts but the board feels like it would be too open with lower counts.

Still a highly unique game after years of Euro-clonish games have tried to emulate various parts of it. The concept that most moves help everyone but help you a bit more (ideally) is still an interesting one. Still, the game can go stale fairly quickly and it does suffer from who sits on your right and left more than many games do.

RATING: 8.5
Puerto Rico is a really challenging game.
It is a lot of fun but even if the rule book has a lot of examples it can sometimes be a bit confusing.
If played with the rules right, Puerto Rico is not that long of a game.
I enjoyed playing it as it gives a lot of strategic depth and has a couple of different victory conditions in case you are being blocked by players in specific tasks.
Once you understand the feel for the game it is easy to play & teach.
The ammount of role information & buildings can sometimes be overwhelming but in a single play you can learn them all.
Give Puerto Rico a chance and I am sure you will enjoy it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
- Gameplay and replayability: 3/3. A thoroughly enjoyable game with almost no downtime.

- Luck factor: 3/3. Zero luck factor. To be honest, this is not 100% true as there is a tiny bit of luck involved with the plantations that come available. However, this has never determined the winner.

- Player range: 3/3. I have no idea why the game is marketed as a 3-plus player game, as it is equally fun with 2 players as it is with 3 and 4. The rules for the two player variant only differ very little.

- Duration: 2/3. Puerto Rico takes some 1.5 hour to play, which is pleasantly short

- Learning curve: 1/3. For an experienced gamer the rules are lightweight, but someone who is not used to playing board games it takes some effort to learn. Some people might be put off by it.

- Theme and looks: 2/3. The components are beautiful and the theme is plausible enough, although some aspects of the theme feel somewhat artificial and pasted on.

- Set up/clean up time: 0/3. This is for my part the only drawback of Puerto Rico. Both setting up and cleaning up take a lot of time, even after taking some painstaking measures to speed up the process. If you intend to play sometimes with 2, sometimes with 3 and sometimes with 4 players, you have to count on spending half an hour for the setup + cleanup.

- Documentation: 2/3. There is sufficient documentation to be able to learn the game easily.

- Durability: 3/3. The components won't wear out easily.

- Portability: 0/3. Not intended for traveling.

- Summary: Even though the setup/cleanup is a nightmare, Puerto Rico is a great game to play and replay with any number of players, especially if you like strategic and zero luck games.

Update: this game is great, but it's been a long time since I've been able to enjoy it.  It's tough when your opponents are inexperienced: this game is so tight that an inexperienced player can really throw it out of whack.  This used to not bother me, but it does now for some reason.

2-5

Doel van het spel:
De speler met de meeste punten (puntenfiches + punten van de gebouwen (bezet/onbezet) + extra punten van bezette grote gebouwen) is de winnaar. Bij gelijke stand wint de speler die de meeste dubloenen en goederen heeft.

Voorbereiding:
Iedere speler krijgt een speelbord, geld (zie hieronder) en 1 plantagekaartje (zie spelregels).

3 SPELERS:
+ 2 dubloenen
+ geen goudzoekers
+ 75 puntenfiches
+ schepen: 4,5 en 6 laadruimte
+ 4 plantagekaarten open
+ 55 kolonisten

4 SPELERS:
+ 3 dubloenen
+ 1 goudzoeker
+ 100 puntenfiches
+ schepen: 5, 6 en 7 laadruimte
+ 5 plantagekaarten open
+ 75 kolonisten

5 SPELERS:
+ 4 dubloenen
+ alle rollenkaarten
+ 122 puntenfiches
+ schepen: 6, 7 en 8 laadruimte
+ 6 plantagekaarten open
+ 95 kolonisten

Speelverloop:

De speler met de gouverneurkaart begint. Hij neemt 1 van de rollenkaarten en voert de bijhorende actie uit. Daarna voeren ook alle andere spelers met de klok mee deze actie uit. De speler die de rol koos heeft recht op een privilege. Wanneer elke speler een rol heeft gekozen, eindigt de ronde. Aan het einde van een ronde wordt er op elke niet-gekozen rol een dubloen gelegd. De gouverneurkaart schuift door naar de volgende speler.

De 7 verschillende rollen:

1/ Landbouwer:

Actie: neem een plantagekaartje (na deze fase worden alle niet-gekozen plantages verwijderd en komen er nieuwe plantages open te liggen). 

Privilege: neem een steengroeve in plaats van een plantagekaartje. 

2/ Burgemeester:

Actie: Verdeel de kolonisten van het schip (beginnend bij de actieve speler) en plaats de kolonisten op je gebouwen/plantages. Bezette gebouwen/plantages vervullen hun functie, onbezette niet. Aan het einde van deze fase komen er minstens zoveel kolonisten op het schip als de som van alle onbezette velden bij de spelers (niet van de plantages en steengroeves). Opgelet: Er worden steeds minstens zoveel kolonisten op het schip geplaatst als er spelers zijn.

Privilege: De burgemeester krijgt 1 extra kolonist uit de algemene voorraad. 

3/ Bouwmeester:

Actie: gebouw bouwen (nooit 2x hetzelfde gebouw bouwen).

Privilege: 1 dubloen korting bij de aankoop van een gebouw.

4/ Opzichter:

Actie: De spelers nemen om beurt hun geproduceerde goederen (bezette plantages leveren grondstoffen op). 

Privilege: De opzichter krijgt één goederensteen extra van een product naar keuze, dat hij net heeft geproduceerd.

5/ Handelaar:

Actie: Volgens beurtvolgorde kunnen spelers maximaal 1 goederensteen aan het handelshuis verkopen. Men ontvangt daarvoor de aangegeven prijs. De handelaarsfase eindigt wanneer elke speler 1 keer aan de beurt is geweest of wanneer het handelshuis vol zit. Als laatste handeling wordt het handelshuis leeggemaakt indien er 4 stenen liggen. Liggen er slechts 1, 2 of 3 stenen, dan blijven alle stenen liggen.

Privilege: 1 extra dubloen bij de verkoop van een goederensteen.

6/ Kapitein:

Actie: De spelers moeten om beurt goederen aan de schepen leveren. Een speler kan telkens enkel goederen leveren van één soort. Op het einde van deze fase mag je slechts 1 goederensteen overhouden (uitzondering: pakhuizen). Als laatste handeling lost de kapitein alle volle schepen.

Privilege: De kapitein krijgt bij een levering één extra punt.

7/ Goudzoeker:

Actie: Geen

Privilege: De goudzoeker neemt 1 dubloen van de bank.

Einde van het spel :

Het spel eindigt aan het einde van de ronde waarin aan minstens 1 van de 3 voorwaarden wordt voldaan:
1. een speler bouwt zijn 12e stadsveld.

RATING: 7
Pretty decent Euro game. I don't think I can add anything that hasn't already been said about the mechanics (and subsequent issues) a dozen times already. Much lauded when it came out over ten years ago, by now I think much better and more interesting (not to mention less contentious) games have appeared. Were it released today I think it would probably rate about a full point lower, but there you go. Still, I give it a shot from time to time.

I do think that 3p has issues with the default setup, as the player that starts with corn has won every single game I've ever played online. It's also obvious that some buildings are more valuable than others, with a few clearly overpriced, and even the designer has stated he would alter the cost of certain buildings were it released today.

Anyway, don't take it too seriously, and avoid the sharks. That pretty much means avoiding places like BSW altogether, otherwise you'll get sworn at if you make a sub-optimal move. Or just do what I do and play a game in 10 minutes against the computer.

Surprisingly enough, this game has lived up to its own hype. It plays in a reasonable amount of time, is suitably strategic, and accomodates 3 as well as it does 5.

Odd game where your options narrow as the game proceeds.  As your board develops it becomes completely unreasonable to choose certain roles, sometimes to the point where you're only ever choosing one of two.  Is the shipping aspect of the game a red herring?  Should have been called: "Just Buy Buildings".  UPDATE: third play still do not enjoy.  BAD MEMORIES DOWNGRADE.  Why would I ever play this again when I could be playing RfTG?  No idea.  DOWNGRADE.

The more I play other games, the more I appreciate Puerto Rico for all the reasons below. 

[November 2016 - 8]
Puerto Rico continues to grow on me. Despite playing a ton of other games, this one has staying power that makes you appreciate its simple mechanics of gameplay and interaction. You're doing your own thing, but always feel invested in others' turns as its essentially your turn as well. I also really enjoy the variant two-player game. 

[October 2015 - 7.6]
I've grown to appreciate Puerto Rico some more. If you play with people who know the game and you're at the same level, the games go a little faster and are close.  I wish the expansions were more widely available as some different building could help bring more variety to the game. 

[July 2014 - 7.3]
I always enjoy a game of Puerto Rico, but in the end, it's not a game I want to rush out and tell everyone about.

Game pieces and boards are a little bland, but wow! what a good game.

Some games can be a bit lopsided if you aren't paying attention to what your opponents are doing. Similarly if you get too far behind there is pretty much no way to come back.

If you can avoid those problems it is a tense back and forth with lots of fun ways to hose your opponents. e.g., making them ship when they don't want to or going to the market when they can't sell anything.

Trading commodities in the New World, with variable movement order and actions. Very clean design, though the typsetting on the rules is bad (small print on blue pictures for the examples). The variable roles was innovative when it first came out. Needs a rewritten and reformatted rule book.

Good, I wanted it to last a little longer I think, but there is a clear opening, midgame, and endgame.
After a couple more (logged and unlogged) plays, I'm fairly satisfied the game ends just when I want to really get into it, but it would fail as a game if it continued past that point. In sum, not my kind of game. Rating downgraded.

RATING: 6
The governor changes every round and I have found that it is almost impossible to get reelected.  I did not know that there were such strict term limits in Puerto Rico, so this game is very educational.  Also, if coffee is worth so much more than indigo, then I must question the intelligence of the guy who runs the trading house.  He should really try to get more than one coffee, and then he could sell the extra one on ebay and get like four or five indigo!!

This game should really be named "Commonwealth of Puerto Rico" because that is its official name.  Puerto Rico means "rich port" in Spanish which sounds nice but I will not award an extra point for this because this game is German not Spanish.  However I will DEDUCT a point because it is politically incorrect to call the slaves "colonists."  This makes light of their struggle.

After twenty plays, I see why this game deserves it's very high rating.   Wow, there is a deep game here that is not immediately apparent once you 'only' understand the rules.

The different buildings provide several paths to victory, and every game is different.

I like this game.  I was actually able to win my second time playing.  Unfortunately, I can see that certain strategies are better than others, which means if you don't get the right choices first, you're probably not going to win.

This is one of my favorite heavy strategy Euro games.  There is a great amount to think about each turn, enough player interaction to keep the game interesting, and enough isolation so that players cannot gang up against the good players to a great degree.  The only thing that keeps this game from getting a higher rating is that it is too complicated to teach to my non-gamer friends and the setup time is rather lengthy.  All things being equal, fewer rules is always better in my book.

I feel this game deserves a high rating due to it's interesting use of the roles and it's various implementation of scoring.

I really like that out of the box without any customization this game has a lot going on.

Having played this quite a few times now, I am enjoying it more than my initial experience. Interactions seems to be somewhat indirect -  more in the nature of constraining the other players' short term options, than any direct interactions.  The game seems more one of flexible tactical manouvering than deep strategy, with your best move very strongly dependent on what other players are doing, or trying to do, at the time.

Another report on PUERTO RICO (PR), the recent Eurogame release from RioGrande games: it's a very good
(possibly great - depends on a few more playings) game. Played four games on Saturday with 3,4,4,and 5 players. 
It has a "Civilization" feel in a way - building up an infrastructure to gain more money, production, buildings and/or victory points. PR is MUCH less detailed and much more streamlined, of course, however, all of the tough decisions of "too many options - too little time and money" are present. The mechanics are simple and elegant, making it easy for beginners to play, but there is a depth of strategy which will make the veteran players wanting to play again and again. 

The comparisons to Princes of Florence (PoF) are inappropriate, in my opinion. PoF seemed like a slow moving multi-player solitaire game to me, whereas, in PR I was always keen to see what the other players were doing and their decisions rarely took more than a minute. So the interaction and game flow in PR are FAR better than in PoF. 

I think PUERTO RICO could end up as one of those Top 10 games of all-time which you can pull off the shelf and play years from now. 

Highly recommended. 9 out of 10.

Now that I have owned this for 6 years, it is the one game that I keep coming back to.  It is relatively easy to teach but has an excellent amount of depth and replayability.  I anticipate owning and playing this for years to come.

Yeah, it wins awards and everyone loves it, but there is just not enough conflict.  Yes, there is picking a role that maximizes your benefit and minimizes others, but anything more agressive than that and you are just allowing everyone but you (doing a suboptimal thing to hurt) and them (the one being hurt) to jump ahead.  That's not competition.  This game is just elegant solitare.

Update 5-7: Hey, expansion came out and is pretty cool.  makes the less chosen roles more attractive and adds some neat new buildings.  When you are good at it player conflict reaches Agricola level, but Agricola is more fun because when you look back down you have something cooler than in PR.

This one has a great reputation here on the Geek and is quite deserving.  It is a great game and I'm always willing to play. I don't rate it as being the best game ever though.  I prefer it as a 5 player or 4 player game. 3er just seems too much like a race.  Caylus is a much better fit in the 3er slot.

I'm starting to come around on the opinion that 5 may be just too many to play this game.  Often you can have a very bad game no matter what decisions you make.  This happened to one of the players in our last game.  I'm bumping this down from a 9 to an 8 because I've come to realized that while I'm always willing to play this very good game...I don't always want to suggest it.

Now I think this game plays best with 3.  The options to victory really open up for building or shipping.

Puerto Rico has been hovering around the edges of my awareness for quite a while. My friend Sam had spoken favorably of it, and had suggested we play it while he visited over the Christmas holiday, but I had convinced everyone to play Catan: Cities & Knights instead. Eventually, as my collection grew, I finally bought a copy. I admit to feeling some reluctance about the game because of its ranking. My concern about the potential of hype delayed my purchase of the game.

I ended up liking it quite a bit when I finally purchased it, and ended up downloading the free Excel implementation of the game and playing it a lot. So much so that I found myself quickly exceeding the experience level of most of the other people I played with and thus winning all the time. This wasn't fun for me and wasn't really fun for them, so my play of the game ratched down substantially to the point where I rarely play the game any more. (My girlfriend comments pretty regularly that she misses playing it.) In the last few months my plays of the game have actually increased because of my girlfriend's desire to play and because of the fact that I have lost a lot of what I once knew. I still win quite a bit, but my mind isn't as entrenched in the game as it was so it is more fun both for me and other people.

I rarely play this anymore, because Race For the Galaxy feels like a largely superior replacement.

Stunning game. Players are settling Puerto Rico in the decades after Columbus&#039; discovery of the new world. They produce goods on their plantations, sell them in town (for money) or ship them back to the Old World (for victory points), lure colonists, prospect, trade, build and so on. It&#039;s all handled in a very elegant manner, using the personality card selection mechanic from Verrater. An excellent and immersive 90 minute game and thoroughly recommended.

This was easier to learn than I expected it to be, although there were a few fiddly rules that we had to doublecheck a couple of times.  I enjoyed it, but due to the level of complexity, I want to play it once more before rating.  As far as classic Euros go, I'd much rather play this than Settlers of Catan.

Update: After a second play, I really enjoyed this. I understood the strategies better, and I feel like this is definitely a game in which your play skill can improve over time. Looking forward to playing again so I can continue to improve my strategy.

It's been maybe a couple of years since i played this one, but for a while it was a regular occurrence. Everyone else seems burnt out on it, be it still holds its appeal to me because the depth of the strategy is amazing (or maybe because I usually win). I think of the game like chess with a theme.  There is almost no random luck, but winning is highly dependent on anticipating what your opponents will do. This leads to some fun table talk as you try to persuade other players about what "their" best move is (I don't know why no one trusts my advice anymore). The only negative I have is that all the bits are a little fiddly, making setup annoying. When I used to play it online, games only took about 1/3 or 1/4 as long.

Awesome game! I love the idea of building an engine through role selection.  There's very little downtime and plenty of options (without going overboard like Agricola).
The only reason this game isn't a 10 is because it does seem to have a runaway winner problem, but maybe I just haven't played enough.

08-22-2012: Played PR with the expansion buildings and they definitely makes this game a 10.  Using a small subset of the larger selection of buildings each game make this game a 10.  The runaway leader problem is mitigated by the variety since the same strategy cannot be used to win every game.

Puerto Rico is great in the sense that it best represent meritocracy, and I love the "role drafting" mechanic in games.  The player that wins in PR deserved to win and did not luck into it (people complain sometimes of the winner playing adjacent to weaker players but I think that is just usually sour grapes).  That said, it is a terribly unforgiving game as well.  If you get behind, you will lose unless your opponent makes a mistake.  There is no high risk gamble to make up the difference, which means that sometimes you will simply be waiting for the hangman.

I like the mechanics alot, but often I just don't feel I have room to breathe - after the first turn or 2 it seems my best choices are scripted and the game becomes mechanical (adding in the expansion alleviates this some).  The game then becomes more of trying to convince the other players to make sub-optimal moves.  Of course I don't win that often so maybe there is more to it than I think. Seems a bad player can mess the game up more than in more modern euro-games.

This is my all time favorite game. The strength of Puerto Rico is the ability to keep all players involved all the time. Anyone who thinks this is 5-player solitaire has never played with someone who knows how to stick it to you. This game is all about "deltas". Your best move is not what is superficially best for you, but rather what gives you the greatest benefit relative to all the other players.

I bought this because I really enjoyed to role selection in San Juan and, of course, its persistent #1 ranking here on BGG.  However, I eventually traded it away unplayed because I just couldn't work up the enthusiasm to play it.  It's not well suited for two players, which means I'd need to get some of my non-gamer friends to invest time into learning it, and if I can get that comittment from them, there's about twenty other games I'm more excited to get to the table.  Frankly, I am a little uncomfortable with the theme, what with all the tobacco production (which bugs me a bit in San Juan anyway), but especially the "colonists".  Also, the potential problems with turn order influence are apparent to me just from reading the rules.  I think I'll get my role selection fix from Race for the Galaxy instead.

Deserving of all the praise it has received, my play group played this once or twice a week every week for well over a year without tiring of it. It has only two flaws in my estimation, though neither kept us from loving the game:

1) The Guild Hall building seems improperly balanced. The abundance of production buildings, and the need to acquire them naturally anyway through the course of the game, makes the Guild Hall much stronger than the other large buildings. If players aren't very careful as a group, the player who buys the Guild Hall wins almost every time.

2) If you play with the same group of people time and again, the game will have a tendancy to get "on the rails." Players will tend to make the same decisions every time, pursuing the same paths to victory. Make sure at the very least you don't sit in the same order each time you play it. And adding in the expansion set and randomly determining the buildings to be used (rather than drafting) can really help snap you off the rails. (Though the Union Hall is ever more imbalanced than the Guild Hall... what is it about Halls in this game?)

When I first played this, I thought it was boring, simplistic, and predictable. But my appreciation for this has gone up with every play. I keep finding more to do, more to find, more unexpected synthesis coming from the game. Definitely a good sign.

I'd definitely rather play this than most of its successors and imitators.

Update: Interaction in this game is subtle and often goes unnoticed, but is the real crux of the play of the game.  JohnRayJr said it best: 

"Puerto Rico strives for the ideal of non-random, no-luck play where the variability emerges almost entirely from players' actions. Each decision you make is a wave that other players are trying to catch. Each wave that comes your way is designed to flatten you. The game is smooth, fast, accessible, deep, complex, and variable, and it makes it all look easy."

Puerto Rico simply rocks.  Every turn has its phases, but you never know in what order they'll occur or who will initiate each one.  There's a definite cooperative element, because rarely can you do something that benefits you without helping someone else as well.  You really have to be careful about who you may be helping!  The game's biggest drawback is that it requires players of reasonably equal skills; otherwise the newbie always hands the game to the old pro with a bad move or two.

RATING: 5.5
This game gets an awful lot of hype, but it isn't so high in my estimation.  I first played it years ago, and somehow won (with a large amount of coaching).  I've played with new players and experienced ones, with 3, 4, and 5, with serious board gamers in tournaments and Magic players dabbling in something different.  

The nearly-no-randomness aspect makes it practically an exercise in groupthink, as well as mapping out what ripple effects your actions will have.  You almost have to ask yourself, "OK, if I take settler this time, will he take prospector or mayor?  Will the next person take the remaining one or craft?"  The ability to predict means the requirement to do so, if you want to win against good players, that is.  Worse still, it's not just about taking the best move for you, but making sure the players downstream don't get set up with anything 'too good', handing them an edge, if not the victory.
This makes it all the more frustrating when the [i]single[/i] random element, the plantation tile draw, doesn't go your way and the corn (or coffee, or whatever) remains hidden.  I wonder how many games are swung by the simple lack of the crop a player was building towards?

I'm also frustrated by the lack of balance/variability in the buildings.  It's always the same ones, and they always get bought in the same pattern.  Some of them are clearly amazing, and others almost worthless.  Then there's the issue of starting turn order, and who gets the best seats for initial crops, plus who gets to sit to the left of the new player and who has to sit left of the shark.

The single worst thing, though, is the lack of scaling for player counts.  With 3 or 4, it's probably ok, but with 5, you start butting up against the piece limits a lot more.  There aren't any more copies of the buildings.  There aren't any more goods in the supply.  Frequently, as you pass into the late game, taking craftsman shoots way up in value, just because it's the only way to guarantee that you actually get your stuff.  I've seen people with a factory and 5 types of goods online get stuck with a measly couple barrels and a buck (instead of the decent haul and 5 they were entitled to), because they were to the right of the player taking craft and got hosed by the arbitrary piece limit.  A bunch of barrels can get stuck on boats or in the trading house, and the players upstream will simply empty out the remaining supply.  This sort of passive-aggressive screwage is PR's bread and butter, but I find it way more annoying at times than other games that are far more confrontational.

Anyway, it's just not fun for me anymore (if it ever was), and I'd rather play something that is.

RATING: 6
Puerto Rico was an extremely influential game, but I find several things about it unpleasant: it's too long, too deep (it rewards experience too heavily), has too strong of a feedback loop, and it overwhelms players with too much strategic space and too steep of a learning curve at the beginning of the game.

Unless all players are equally matched and playing optimally, the game can lack tension for multiple types of players: new players, players who haven't memorized the buildings, players who make an early mistake, or players who spend less time looking ahead. Even if players are closely matched at the beginning, they may all be able to tell who will win and who will lose when the game is only 2/3 complete (which means you can spend up to an hour knowing you will lose).

For people who want to explore the depths of a game with exactly the same group of equally matched players, and derive enjoyment from gradual mastery of its depth, I'm sure Puerto Rico is rewarding. But that's not what I want from a game.

I'm glad designers realized the game was too deep and too long and created spinoff games like San Juan, Race for the Galaxy, and Glory to Rome. They all improve on Puerto Rico in some ways (mostly by reducing strategic lookahead and reducing playtime).

But card game reimplementations tend to remove the thing I like best about Puerto Rico: interaction. Because you can see the full state of other players' positions, you can anticipate and thwart their plans. Having a hidden hand of cards and using simultaneous action selection (as in Race for the Galaxy) removes too much of that anticipation and interaction for me.

So what game feels similar to Puerto Rico, while improving its shortcomings and retaining its interaction? Splendor!

Splendor allows you to see other people's positions and thwart their plans (it actually provides more blocking opportunities than Puerto Rico), it lets you plan ahead (but not too far) by looking at a shared game state, has you gathering pieces that later combine to improve your position (gem discounts in Splendor are the same thing as quarries and buildings in Puerto Rico). Yet Splendor lasts 45 minutes, is easier to teach, has a game state that's easier to parse, and is better at maintaining endgame tension.

[b](My very first PR Game-5 Players)[/b]
I think I've found my new favourite game. After owning this game for over a year, I got to play it for the first time tonight. Man, this game is good. Now I understand how BGGers can stomach playing this game over a hundred times!

I was less confident with the components (no graphics on building and thin cardstock; I can't stand with these) and the lack of brief/short explanation of the buildings displayed on board. So I went gaga and printed out every single player aid that I can find. After my first play, I can official say they're not really necessary (the universal head player aid is handy though; role and building sides). Those printed on the board is more than enough. But I hope future players will find my printed player aids useful somehow.

[b]Comment on 2-players experience with the official rule.[/b]
Puerto Rico is also good with two! Man, I can't get enough of this game. Hopefully I will not burnt out. The rule feels right and it didn't change much with the normal 3-5 players game. A round will end (change of governer) when both players have picked 3 roles respectively.

RATING: 5
I admire this system a lot: little downtime, all players usually involved; having a player pick a role and each player perform the action was very innovative.  But it’s too calculational and deterministic; it has the puzzle/optimization feel of many Euros.  Too much non-spatial lookahead is needed to do well.  In our games, taking the craftsman is a bad idea (in 5 player game)--chooser typically gets locked out of trading and shipping-- leading to some game stagnation since no one wants to pick it.  Also, some buildings’ costs seem out of whack for their utility (small market, university), and player order is too influential: the first player usually falls behind while the 4th or 5th player often wins.  A nice game to admire, not to play.

I owe Puerto rico a new go with a new perspective. It got overwhelmed by the sizeable amount of games I bought and played shortly after his arrival. I don't have very fond memories of it, but it's a classic, it's much appreciated by players everywhere, and we owe him credit for the "Renaissance" of Board Games we are living in the 2010s. I'll come back to you someday and maybe I'll change my mind!

One of the classics and maybe first Euro I played somewhere in the first decade of 21st century. It brought us remarkable [b]role selection mechanic[/b] that is used in two of my very loved games: Twilight Imperium and Race for the Galaxy. It's about building colony in Caribbean Puerto Rico, expanding San Juan with various early industrial buildings and plants, employing workers (avoiding to say slaves), growing food, producing goods and selling them for money or shipping them off the island for points. Mayor with the most points wins. Very good game with a moderate replayability for up to 5 players. There is also hard to get expansion which I want to try.

[b]Update:[/b] Dropped to 8.9 from 9.0 due to the lack of variability.

I can see why its popular. I dont connect the mechanics with the theme at all. Which is ashame because economic themes intrigue me. This is just about maximising your efficiency, whilst damaging your opponents.

I don't mind slavery in games, I think exploring such issues in a game is a good thing. My issue here is the game calls them colonists and sweeps the issue under the carpet.

One of my favorite games. "Turn within a turn" structure can be confusing for new players, so teaching the game can be difficult.  I like the fact that the game is relatively low on luck, and several strategies (and combinations of strategies) can lead to victory. 

A big part of the game is predicting what other players will do (and selecting an appropriate strategy based on their actions), but there isn't a lot of direct conflict.  It's virtually impossible to "gang up on" other players, and the amount of "screwing over other players" that can happen is relatively minimal. 

High replayability.  There's a reason this one was #1 on BGG for so long.  It's an older game, but really is a fantastic one.

Puerto Rico is an excellent game. I  have bought the expansion of Puerto Rico. I've tried the expansion a couple of times online, but never in person. 

Haven't played this game in a very long time. I guess that what happens sometimes when you often buy new games. Older games are put aside. Definately a game which is worth more playing time.

It has been no.1 on BGG since 2002.

I got so many board games and I know people with lots of board games too. Kinda hard to play every game we own in a short period of time since some games will get more plays.

I have played it more when I go to the WBC each year. 11 plays since recording games played.

*UPDATE* Won`t play Puerto Rico again at the WBC. I always finish last. Had some bad experiences. 

2 of the logged games came from Granby 2006 convention Puerto Rico tournament. I was in the final and finished 4th.

This is an exceptionally well balanced game. It's really a fairly simple worker placement, but the number of strategies is exponential leaving lots of room for replay. I've only ever played it with 3 players so would love to play with 4 or 5 but right now this game is definitely in my top 10!

I just don't like this game.  It's a little bit too unbalanced for me; if one player grabs a couple of the right buildings, it's hard to play catchup.  It's hard to get a mental idea of what plays are good strategy as well.  Not my kind of thing.

Great game to pick up and teach to new players. The game mechanics are pretty simple and it has just enough competition to keep people interested for many plays.

I like this game, but everyone playing needs to have a similar mindset for a good game. A mixed group of hardcore analyzers and carebear play-for-fun types will leave neither party satisfied. 

If you are the win-at-all-costs type playing with new or casual players, you may have more fun playing a goofy suboptimal strategy than what your min/max brain is telling you to do.

There's little player interaction and little luck involved, the biggest luck factor would be who sits to the left of the most inexperienced/worst player in a competitive game.

Puerto Rico is an amazing game. I really love the game, unfortunately the others in my regular group don't really enjoy it all that much. I also think it kept being looked over for newer, flashier titles, which is a shame. Luckily many folks at the meetups I attend play it often so I am sure I'll still have many opportunities to play it (including online play at Board Game Arena).

The tough decisions, the multiple strategies, and the lack of luck really make the game great for me. Plus it has little to no downtime as the turns are quick and what others do greatly impact your decisions.

UPDATE: I've swung back to like PR more again. Granted, I don't hang out with those "beard and suspenders" types that analyze everything until it's not fun any more, so YMMV. Yes, the "player on the right" thing is definitely there. If everyone is on the same level, it can be pretty great though.

A classic game. It's quite good but maybe not worth all the hype. It is a really good game (an excellent game that everyone should try at least once, mind you) but just misses...something to put it over the top. I really think that San Juan gives you enough of the PR feel in a much more elegant package.

My main problem with it is that you can get too thrown off by the "player on your right" syndrome and that can get really frustrating. Think "continually getting kicked in the teeth for a hour and a half" frustrating. No, I'm not bitter. Okay, I am.

RATING: 7
The most innovative aspect of this game is the role selection and how bonuses are added to unused role.  It's interesting to see a euro that uses victory points without a track for all to see, making the end game more tense.  There are 3 methods of ending the game which is in the player's control which usually ensures that the game rarely feels stale.  I like that the game plays fairly quickly when everyone knows what they're doing.  My only problem is that some of the buildings feel useless for their cost.  Even though I like Puerto Rico, Race for the Galaxy has completely replaced this game for me.

Considered by many to be the crowning achievement of Euro game design this game has everything that makes it a classic: 1) Many viable strategies that interlock in always interesting ways 2) asymmetrical roles that players can take each round 3)  money management that makes you bite your nails 4) beautiful game material and 5) already proven durability.
This is one of the games that can be the ideal gateway to Eurogames in general, as it shows perfectly what this medium can achieve. A classic.

I liked it. But it seemed a bit... alike all other euro games - I assume it's as I've played other games before this, when this was most peoples first foray into games like this. Still I would play again! :)

EDIT: Really got into this and played many games - I can see why it was so popular! No luck (other than your opponents) which is what I like!

SOLD IT!

At the time of it's release, it was an interesting unique game. The glut of new games since then and the ease of just playing a digital version, have tarnished the need to own a physical copy.

Fun Fact: I did get to play it in Puerto Rico!

There are good elements in the game but it still leaves me a feeling was there all? Game always ends like crash to the stone. I've never understood why this has been at BGG rank #1 for so long time. There are so many more comfortable games in the world... ok, I can still play this anytime but if I can choose of Puerto Rico and San Juan I commonly choose San Juan.

The game is quite intimidating to start.  The game play remains very complex, even after a dozen or so plays.  It is very difficult to follow what is going on, with so many pieces all doing something, the flood of options is overwhelming.  The expansion does not help, with complex set up rules, seems like it is more of a pain then it is worth (not terribly hard rules, just annoying).  

The game still is a bit of fun once you get into it, but not my favorite by a long shot.  I would reccommend it with a warning.  Not for the light gamer.

My favorite game and i don't think it can ever change. This game is so perfect is every aspect on boardgaming. Time is right, not to fast not too slow and moreover it is control by players. Second it has both tactical(role selection) and strategical ( main ways to win) aspect is so well developed. Finally I really like the effects of roles. Each roles has to be chosen carefully that u won't help others but urself. The only thing I think is negative and doesn't bother me too much is the difference in experiences and the seating.

RATING: 10
The King of all board games (IMHO). I have been playing this game for years, and I still chomp at the bit to play this gem. Building a successful factory, or establishing a corn wharf are extremely fulfilling, and the 'craftsman angst' is delightfully excruciating. I have yet to play a game that comes close to reproducing the Puerto Rico experience, which in the current age of board games speaks volumes, and confirms the timelessness it holds. The two expansions add some spice, but aren't super necessary because the base game is the best there is. Simply the best.

Decent semi-multi-player-solitaire. Not the #1 game by far in my book. Each player has their own buildings, plantations, colonists, and crops. They only share ships and the trading post. Too much chaos for me with more than 3 players.

+Beautiful blend of tactics and strategy
+VERY interactive
+Relatively simple to teach for its depth and complexity
+Games last for a very satisfying length of time and do not overstay their welcome
+Multiple different game end conditions give players lots of opportunities to try to close out the game at the ideal time for them
+Lack of too many options at the same time keeps the game digestible while those available choices are all interesting and have noticeable impact on the results
+Near simultaneous play keeps everyone engaged

-Aesthetically lacking
-The game is generally very satisfying, but not really exciting
-Some excessive and unintuitive complexity, variety of phases make it slow to teach despite the overall simplicity
-Winner can become obvious partway through the game and then it becomes a matter of playing to a foregone conclusion
-Dislike it at 5 players as it exacerbates issues of a bad player skewing the game towards the player who goes immediately after them (don't run out of goods or space on ships as easily in 3 or 4 player)

After playing this game more and more I'm starting to "get it" more. I feel this is the best of many resource management games that I've played. while other try to add more and more (I'm looking at you Le Havre) This has much the same feel and same decisions in a much smaller package. Still I'm not about to bring this out when there is a huge gap in understanding.

I keep coming back to this game.  The more newer games I play the more Puerto Rico's brilliance stands out.  There are lots of good games, but I don't know of any that offers everything that it does, including
1) Depth of strategy (with very little luck)
2) Lots of player interaction
3) The enjoyment of building an economic engine
4) Very reasonable playing time (and player numbers)

One of the perfect games in many ways.  I've found that I need different strategies based on the number of players, and the various start scenarios.  Playing with different competitors also keeps it interesting.  There are enough options that you don't quickly run out of options for testing different strategies and combinations.   70w4

[1 play] Yeah, finally played Puerto Rico.  For years I’ve been--probably "avoiding" would be putting it too strongly, but definitely not seeking this out.  It just didn’t appeal, based not so much on what I’d heard about the game itself, but about the behavior it brings out in (some) people.  

So it was actually pretty agreeable.  PR is an interesting game, lots to think about, and I can see why people like it so much.  I definitely don’t like it as much as Agricola, but am looking forward to playing again.

And the bonus was that I finally got some benefit out of the hours of my life that have been wasted playing Race for the Galaxy, inasmuch as RftG made the role selection aspect of PR familiar.

RATING: 7
A good Eurogame, lots of strategy can be implemented when playing this one. Played by the right players and it can be cutthroat..

The downside is that once people understands how to play it, the strategy used is somehow repetitive in almost every game because the most profitable choice is very apparent..

Es un JUEGAZO con mayÃºsculas!! Se trata de fundar tu pequeÃ±a ciudad mercantÃ­l e intentar obtener la mejor producciÃ³n para tener mayores opciones de victoria.

Como habrÃ©is visto en mi lista no lo tengo en propiedad y no es porque no merezca ser tenido sino por que lo tienen casi todos los colegas con los que juego.
Es muy original a la par que un poco racista (nadie negarÃ¡ que traer "colonos" de color negro o marrÃ³n oscuro en uin barco y ponerlos a trabajar bien en edificios o bien en campos de azÃºzar o cafÃ© y sin salarios es un poco sospechoso, no?). Pero a pesar de Ã©ste pequeÃ±o detalle es juego es impresionante y da la posibiliadad de jugar de diferentes maneras y todas con el miosmo fin: conseguir mÃ¡s piuntos de victoria que nadie, pero para ello puedes o vender muchos "barriles" o tener muchos colonos o tener muchas plantaciones o tener muchos edificios... 
AlgÃºn consejo para ganar:.... dificil ,hay muchas opciones. El Hospicio es muy bueno, pero tambiÃ©n lo es intentar producir lo que otros no tienen; al principio el dinero serÃ¡ fundamental y a medida que avance la partida irÃ¡ perdiendo todo el valor. Consigue colocar de la mejor manera posible los barrilas de producciÃ³n en los barcos y recuerda, que si en ningÃºn juego hay amigos en Ã©ste menos.

Por fin lo tengo y versiÃ³n en ESPAÃ‘OL!!!

Puerto Rico makes great use of role selection. Much of how well a player does will revolve around the actions they choose and how well they predict their opponents' actions. 
A good strategy backed by the right buildings is also essential.

Quick decisions will have you completing a game in under an hour. There is tension as much of the score is not revealed until the end.

After 2 quick plays this evening I discovered that PR was neither as complicated or as confusing as I originally thought. A buddy and I played the "official" 2 player variant and I walked away with the delicious taste of intrigue on my pallet. A wonderful example of less random and more strategy. This game is for anyone that likes to think while gaming. Brilliant.

RATING: 5
I kind of liked this game when I first played it, but after 15 or so plays I've gone right off it. 
This may be due to the people I usually play with (my wife and another couple) where they always all go for a shipping strategy.  This bores me to tears and I just can't make a building strategy work when they keep shipping all the time. Also, the 2 girls don't quite 'get' the idea that your best move is the one that disadvantages everyone else the most (especially the 'leader') - so the result is usually a foregone conclusion. 
I agree with a number of people who feel that 'the game plays them' - and because the result depends so much on what other people do, it's almost impossible to try out any strategies and knowif they are reliable or not.
OK - rant over......

It's #1 for a reason, isn't it?  Wait...now it's #2!  or #3?  or #2?  At any rate it's near top of the yo-yo.

This kind of game definitely appeals to me a lot, and although I probably wasn't ready for this earlier, I think we are now, especially as our children get older.  One comment is that people less experienced with the game are at a large disadvantage - it's best with a group of four equally skilled players.  I've played it several times now, and it's a decent meaty game that rewards repeated play.

1. Craftsman Advantage:
a) Official Alea variant [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/1583/puerto-rico-variant-for-2-players-doc]here[/url] (Office and Wharf are both very powerful).  
b) Amended Alea variant: to keep nearly all roles being picked, use the 6 basic roles (no prospectors) and have each player choose 2 roles a turn, leaving 2 unpicked.
2. Craftsman Angst (Alternative Alea variant): use 7 basic roles and have Governor choose 3 and opponent 2, to prevent back-to-back Governor Effect.  See [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/679955]this article[/url] for a full description (thought to test, to keep original tight finances: governor only adds 1 doubloon instead of 2?).

Other possible amendments to 2 player variant:
- choose 12 violet buildings at random (ideally including expansion buildings) 
- replace Construction Hut with Office, or reduce Trading House size from 4 to 3.

I got rid of Puerto Rico for a few reasons. Mostly because I don't feel like this game offers a lot more than San Juan for its added complexity. It's a difficult game to get to the table, given my other options. Its lack of much of a luck element also makes it less approachable given the irregularity of play. I am also in a mixed race gaming group now and I don't think the brown workers in a colonization game is an appropriate thematic element for us.

It's taken me over 5 plays of PR to warm up to its design. It's a good game, and while I'll never go hog wild for it like some, I'd like to put in another dozen plays exploring it. It's not an intuitive game but rather a deduction as to what the best play is based on the wake you'll leave behind for other players. It's always felt constrained to me in that your job is not to decide which option you want to take but rather to find the best choice of those before you and choose it (and there is only one best choice). That sort of analysis felt very dry at first, but now I've come to find the fun in it (nothing like actually winning a game to whet the appetite). 

I see others commenting that the building decision space is not as large as it appears due to some buildings be clearly superior to others, and I do see a couple of my friends playing the same game every time, so I'm not sure how long the shelf life is here, but I'm happy to explore it. My rating is up from a 5 at one point to a 7.

Great game but ugly board imo. I really dislike the card board pieces and the board has weak art work. However, this game has awesome strategy and premise, similarly to agricola. Strategy is less diverse than agricola though, so it does bring it down some. Still very high on this game and will continue to enjoy the more I play. A lot of replay value here as well.

Puerto Rico is one of a handful of games that our group has played to death, and we've been gaming together for 21 years.

This game not only defines the term "tacked on theme," the theme it superficially adopts is racist.  As a reward for surviving the Middle Passage, the slaves, I mean "colonists" get to toil in this gutless, boring eurogame. 

To be clear, I don't object to games covering difficult subject matter, and as a wargamer I have no problem playing as "[url=http://youtu.be/hn1VxaMEjRU]the baddies[/url]."  However, Puerto Rico's disingenuously whitewashed depiction of exploitative economic practices is cowardly and embarrassing.  

This game is also unforgivably dull.

I learned to play this at a computer graphics visualization conference. I didn't know what to make of it back then but have grown to admire it over the years. Simple, elegant, and never with a down moment waiting for your turn since you perform an action for most roles. This is one of my all-time top games. I'm really interested in trying out the expansions from the Alea Treasure Chest.

- Long setup time. (There are a lot of threads listing more minuses for Puerto Rico.)

Update (after three years, 8-->9): I finally started to use '10' ratings. Puerto Rico looks more like a '9' at the moment. Race for the Galaxy may be a better game, but I still have fond memories of Puerto Rico.

There are so much things about this game that I really love. The greatest thing is of course the role selection. You have to consider not only what is best for yourself, but what could be a good role to take, which makes it really bad for other players. Also the purple buildings makes you want to explore this game over and over again for different strategies. I have to give a minus point for the playing time, which is said to be 90 minutes. I cannot understand how you can play it in less than 2 hours.

Finally decided that the turn order dependence of this classic game was just too much to keep it on my shelf.  I have it on the iPad if I really get an itch to play again.
[b]previous comment:[/b]

Puerto Rico is a classic design, with a great balance and very elegant systems.  However, the lack of any sort of variable setup, mixed with the strong dependence on player order, keeps it from getting a higher score from me.  When it comes to role selection games, I think I prefer those where roles are selected simultaneously (ala Race for the Galaxy), rather than in player order.  Puerto Rico pioneered a lot of great concepts that other games have benefited from, and I give the design mad respect for that, but I find myself wanting to reach for those other games first.

I actually prefer it at 2p, but only when playing with the "craftsman angst" variant.  This removes the player order effect to the game, and makes it much stronger IMO.

Based on one playing, this seems like an overrated pile of cardboard rectangles with a lot of text on them. Well designed, but too contrived. All the different building powers seem arbitrary, and easy to add more powers since they don't fit together naturally anyway. The tiny amount of interaction in character choosing seems chaotic and dependent on turn order. I think it would have made a better card game than board game because there isn't any spatial interaction.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8

Finally got a full game and whilst it's very very good, it's not all that. Not much player interaction other than trying to stop the others doing better than you. But, planning and getting the phases right and having cash to build early all make it a neat experience. There's a lot of german text on buildings with conditional rules, so get the Rio Grande edition. It's these rules that make the game.

Holy crap is this game great!  It can be intimidating for players because this is structured in a "here's a whole bunch of mechanics, hopefully you can figure out how to win!" sort of way.  But I love how the only random element of the game is a collection of face-up tiles which the players have essentially equal access to, demanding that players successfully anticipate one another's choices in order to succeed.  Good replay, even after playing enough times to sort of sense which sort of conditions you're playing with, and how you should best react.  Nice components, too.

Fun game, lots of interesting decisions and room for strategy.  I find it hard to find people to play with amongst my mostly non-game-geek friends.  It's usually easier to play a shorter game than this, but I am working on getting them used to the idea.  It tends to take 90-120 minutes when we play, but we're still getting the hang of it.  It definetely takes some fun out when you play with people who are new to the game and are not quick or too bright.

I could get many plays out of this before getting sick of it, but I can see how eventually I would.  I usually choose other games to play, but after a while without my PR fix I need to break it out.

One other thing, it brings up some sensitive issues depending who you play with.  I have some Puerto Rican friends and I played this with them, and the first thing they noticed was the little brown guys, the "colonists" - are really slaves.  Who worked the plantations?  Colonists or slaves?  It would be less offensive if at least I painted them different shades.

Not the most popular game in my circle, but Puerto Rico really stands out in my collection because of its overwhelming focus on long-term economic planning over turn-by-turn opportunism and blind luck (though there certainly is a little of each of those there too).  While it appears pretty intimidating, the game is actually quite simple, with the entire gameplay being each player picking roles in order to carry out actions to ultimately garner them enough victory points to win.  It doesn't tend to drag on like Catan or many other games I enjoy occassional do, but it definitely isn't a filler game either.  There is also a two-player variant, which is pretty fun, though as usual, more is always better.  So far I have only played with two and three players, but I am looking forward to the higher levels of competition and additional factors that come with four or five player games.

I think this is a good piece of game design, but it has been replaced by Race for the Galaxy for me. Race for the Galaxy keeps nearly all the parts of Puerto Rico that I like, dispenses with the rest, and adds tons more variability in a shorter time frame. Still, Puerto Rico is a classic action-selection game; it simply lacks variability and has been surpassed by similar games. I am glad I owned it in the past, but I never need to play it again.

DESIRABILITY: No desire to play it again.

REPLACED BY: Race for the Galaxy

Played 30+ times. Less mathematical, but about the same interaction as Princes of Florence (so, open to charges of "multiplayer solitaire"). Still mostly indirect interaction. Not quite as tense as PoF for me. Even though I like this game and enjoy playing it, there are quite a few games I'd rather play. I feel that Taj Mahal and P.O.F. are both better than this game. Getting a bit bored of it,a nd find the game can drag too much. As neat an ideas as it is, I really this this game is blown all out of proportion for its 'greatness'. It's a solid 8, but not an obsession. [Owned, then sold, then traded for again, now trying to trade away.]

18th play: 5. Oct/14. After a long layoff, I came back to this game, very curious to see how I would feel about it. In short: my tastes have changes, and this game has been overtaken by others of a similar style. Race for the Galaxy is so similar, but puts a sci-fi skin on it (which I prefer), reduces both set-up and play time considerably, and offers more variability through not just expansions, but even the large draw deck.

Everyone seems to be sick of this one, but I'm not.  However, I don't like what I believe to be an advantage in turn order of second place if first place choses building, which they often do, because then 2nd place indigo colonizes & can produce.  Then 4th & 5th place corn for the same reason & also because in the building phase they can select another advantageous building.  This gets only a nine since I like the expansion played with random building placement better.

4/27/10  Puerto Rico is OK, but if I'm playing poorly in a game, I want my farm or space empire to suffer, not have the person on my left win easier.

5/25/10  Very consistent at game night last night... Last place in Puerto Rico and Hansa.

5/25/10  Puerto Rico was better this time. I felt like I started to have a strategy. It might not have been a good strategy, but it was something.

Lots of games of San Juan helped my wife and I prepare for this one.  Our games are always close.  The two-player game is excellent, even better than I expected, but I prefer it with four.  I still haven't played with an odd number, and I've been lucky enough to avoid playing with the anyone from the "optimal play" crowd.

Targeted to be played soon as part of our ongoing "Oldies But Goodies" project. Last played: 2-16-08

RATING: 7
A more intricate and deterministic incarnation of the San Juan/RftG mechanic. I prefer RftG due to the shorter downtime (via its simultaneous turn mechanic), the wider variety of and greater access to powers, and the less fiddly economy (Puerto Rico requires plantations, production buildings and colonists in order to produce goods).

There is a lot of fiddliness in the colonist replenishment, limited goods, shipping space and trading house space; these provide opportunities for denial that RftG lacks.

Understanding the rudiments of the game, I don't dislike it as much as I used to.

Good game.  I've played a few times but it isn't drawing me in.  If others in my group wanted to play it I'd go for it, but It didn't make a big splash for us.  I think it's a bit dry and learning the buildings is a turn off for some.  I don't doubt it's a fantastic game.

RATING: 7
My wife and I quite enjoy the 2player variants.  Considerably lighter with just the two of us than more players as we play pretty fast, but that's fine.  I also enjoy the goods barrels quite a bit.  I don't know why.  I also appreciate that the game is so easy to explain.  It goes over well with almost anybody.

I used to like this a lot, but it doesn't interest me as much as it used to. I think the game has too programmed feel. It lasts quite long and with the people I have played it, it seems to drag forever. Just a regular (althought popular) eurogame in my hubmle opinion.

RATING: 8
[System Game, Economic, Investment] {2P:8, 3P:6, 4P:10, 5P:6} Amazing game of economics and interaction. Puerto Rico is fairly simple, plays quickly, and is deeply thought-provoking. It scales beautifully from two to five players (it's best with five). It's not really "deep" in the traditional sense, but timing is the main cog to the variability of the game. You'll be talking about games after they end, then want to play again immediately. Elegant mechanics, multiple roads to victory, interesting strategy and subtle yet vicious tactics make this a must-have for any German gamer. ***UPDATE: Affirming my 10 rating for PR. Still fantastic, 120  plays later. However, I no longer believe that I can label PR as the "deepest game of all time", or even as the "greatest game of all time". It's simply one of the best that I have played, but I cannot hold it above E&T, PoF and MtG. Regardless, it is an obligatory addition to any gamer's library. *** UPDATE: Dropped from 10 to 9 due to weaknesses in the 3P and 5P games, which magnify the weak player syndrome and detract from the enjoyment of the game. E&T and PoF do not have this adjacency problem. PR is still a great game, but it's not in the class of E&T and PoF. *** UPDATE: Ok, after playing a ludicrous number of games of PR I'm pretty sure that the 3P and 5P games of PR are simply not balanced. You're liable to get whacked in the trading house just because of the timing of the game and not because of anything that you did. That's just not acceptable. It might have been a good idea to made additional trading houses that scaled like the ships scale. As it is, the 4P game is still one of the best that boardgaming has to offer, but I'll only play 3P or 5P if asked. The 2P games remains pretty good, if a bit chesslike.

RATING: 8
Rating seems to be falling. No longer has a place in my top 10. It's not a bad game, but after playing so many deep, rich and fulfilling Euros, this one really lacks the oomph. 

I love that it is economic, and I love that it works well with 2, but I just don't find the decisions that interesting or satisfying for some reason. I miss the pain in making decisions in this game. 

Mostly, I'm annoyed because I can't figure out why it is *so* popular.

Indestructible !

All people (gamers, geeks, newbies, my wife, my parents ...) which i introduced to Puerto Rico really like this game and want to play it again and again.

I must say it has everything to be attractive :
- rich without being heavy or over complex
- planning
- interaction
- tension
- multiple paths to victory
- great replayability
- relatively easy to explain

For me, the mechanism that brings all the tension to the game is the filling of the ships and the shipping to the old world by the captain.

Puerto Rico must be present in any respectable game library.

Awesome 2 players game.

Fantastic Euro that keeps people interested even when out of the running, and the action selection keeps downtime very low.

Fun game, but not as much fun (and as easy to remember the steps in each turn) as Endeavor.  I lost my first game, but with 36 points, which a veteran player said was really good for a first game (which usually has scores in the 20s).  Played it again and it's definitely more fun than Shipyard, but still like Endeavor better (lost again, but with 53 point score this time).

RATING: 6
It's a good game, and I certainly recognize the elegance of its design.  The only thing that dampens my enthusiasm for it are the stories of how a newbie can completely throw a game to more experienced players if scripted strategies are not followed.  And once those optimized strategies are learned, I imagine it becomes less of a game and more a procedural "going through the motions".  I'd rather instead just play a game that can be grokked relatively quickly and is fun for *everybody*, despite the players' experience-level...

This game offers an incredible amount of player interaction, moreso than most other euros I can think of. However, its greatest asset is also my greatest source of frustration with it. You're often so dependent on the actions of others that bad or even mediocre play from another player can drastically affect you. That gives Puerto Rico a strong kingmaker vibe and an almost random feel in a way to me. But that being said, it's still a wonderful game worthy of its accolades.

Nós somos o “Cristovão Colombo” e nosso objetivo é colonizar Porto Rico. Nós devemos plantar, construir, produzir bens, vender e exportar estes bens para as metrópoles. A diversão do jogo fica na escolha de ações, colonizar, povoar, construir, produzir, vender, exportar e minerar, que cada jogador tem como opção. O jogo se desenvolve em conseqüência dessas ações e por tanto o peso da sorte é mínimo. O seu rendimento depende, principalmente, das escolhas que você fizer em cada momento do jogo. Outro ponto alto do jogo para ter um bom resultado é, além de escolher as ações corretas, montar combinações de edifícios que tragam mais retorno durante o jogo. No fim, quem acumular mais pontos, decorrentes das exportações e edificações, vence.É verdade que o setup e setdown do jogo são demorados mesmo assim é um excelente jogo e foi por muito tempo o nº1 do BGG.

I never got around to playing this one until 2010.  I expected to feel like I had seen it reimplemented in far superior ways, but that is not the case.

I find it as refined and balanced and tense as any similar, subsequent games.

No luck means you can only blame yourself when you lose. Which means you'll be blaming yourself a lot when you first start playing it, which means you're first win will get you addicted. I have lowered my rating half a point because I've recently realized that this game is not as much fun as I once thought it was. It's a great game and I really enjoy it, but when everyone is playing die-hard to win, it's a little too tedious and not so much fun.(A little too much like work, not a game.)

Easy to learn.  Really fun.  Flexible number of players.  I like how everything you do effects other players. I like how this game is just simple enough to let you plan three turns ahead. You can score boons for yourself and mess up your opponents' plans. 

This used to be the second or third game I would teach to new players after something easier to teach like Dominion are Carcassone. I think it has been supplanted by Phoenicia though. 

After owning this for 7 years the game is a little stale for me. There are about three strategies in the game (my opinion) and I think that one of them is the best. A game with good players would still be really tactically challenging and rewarding, but it will take some investment to get players to that level. That time is better spent elsewhere these days. 

I'm leaving this at the 7 I gave it originally because it deserves it. I would still play this game and still use it to teach newcomers.

OK but there's something about this game I don't like and I can't put my finger on it. I can't seem to find a strategy that works for me and I get frustrated with it.
Finishing last every time no matter what strategy I use is not good for morale. Perhaps I just need more practice, but to be honest, there are other games I would rather play, this game just doesn't do it for me.

With roughly equal good players a great game where you always seek to get more out of each action than your opponents. As it has very low luckelements it perhaps can become slightly scripted if you play it regularly in the same group but I never came so far yet. (And there is an expansion to solve this.)

The game is fun, but it can be overwhelming for newer players and it can feel scripted for experienced players.

Brilliant game about imperialism.  The best part is the game's ingenious turn-taking mechanism; one player selects the next move and all the player's take that move.  There is so much to like about this game though.  It's not too long, has a lot of depth, you get to build things, and there are several different paths to victory.  Definitely one of the best games out there.

This one is a classic. Short enough, but with lots of substance and strategy. Perhaps those are my three favorite components - Short, Substance, Strategy. Yet, for some reason, the game doesn't capture my imagination. It was at the top of my list for about 3 games and then fell. It now collects dust. I do like, and play regularly, it's offspring - San Juan. I would rate it higher than PR!

Excellent game.  Too soon to know if it&#039;s a 10 (will it stand the test of time), I thought Settlers of Cataan was a 10 when I got it, but then found that following a prescribed formula of rules, while fun, does tire after a while.  Has anyone ever had a &quot;memorable&quot; game of Settlers, or Puerto Rico?  I&#039;ve had memorable games (i.e. I can recall them years later) of Magic Realm, and Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.

The ultimate Euro city-building game. PR is a game that really requires several plays to make the best of it, and that's good, because I would definitely play it almost any time. It gives you space to experiment but also rewards skilled players.  The best feature is that there are actions for every player to do on every turn, so that keeps everyone in it.  Relatively easy to teach to newcomers as well. There are a few things that aggravate me about Puerto Rico in terms of turn order and timing, but it's aggravating in a good sort of way. PR is a standard of Euro gaming.

I purchased this game at a local game shop blindly based on reading it was the best game according to some online gaming community.  I opened the box and was confounded by the seemingly countless pages of rules and promptly stored the game in a closet for the foreseeable future.  It was only years later, after having been introduced to other Eurogames, that I finally got to play it.  This allowed me to approach Puerto Rico without regards to its place in gaming history and also its BGG ranking.  And I think the game is great.  

I should note that I'm awful at the game, just awful.

Play it and you'll see why it is such a famous and recognized game. It was very innovative and created a brand new game category. After you have played it hundred of times some variety start to become necessary. It tends to be predictable. Player experience is very unforgiving, if you don't know how to play and you play with experienced players you might get trampled on and your choices may screw up the game for experienced players. It is fun anyway and I recommend it greatly. (It has some beauty issues since the buildings are not illustrated. You may change that by some cutting and pasting, it takes some work but it's totally worth it)

It is funny to say that at a 6, Puerto Rico has actually risen in my standings (I used to have it at a five).  I can see what people love about this game, but it also might be the same elements that have made me luke warm to it.  It feels very much like a solitare experience, and it also seems to a degree solvable.  It has a learning curve for developing strategies therefore giving experienced players a huge advantage over those not as familiar.  My most recent playing, after not having wanted to touch it for a year, did spark some interest in me.  I shall get this on the table again soon, and reevaluate my love/hate for it. 

UPDATE:  I am raising Puerto Rico's score to an 7.  However, with this game seemingly overplayed by so many it is hard to entertain a game with like leveled players.  I still find that the learning curve in accordance to the game's many stategic options makes the game lop-sided if not attended by gamers with similar handicaps.  This phenomenon is highly noticeable in Puerto Rico, where in other games it is less black and white.  In post game analysis when one or two players are just beginning to notice small mistakes, and errors in judgement, while others are writing disertations (making the former  overwhelmed in a gaming analysis shadow) it makes for an uncomfortable and bewildering feeling.  I am no longer blind to the game's depth, nor do I find it dry or inexcusably label it solitaire as I did in my early impressions, I do however find that the age of the game coupled with the diversity in experience of players makes Puerto Rico flawed by no merit of it's own.

UPDATE:  8!!

Clearly an execelent game.  Replayibility is outstanding.  However, it is better online than FTF for a couple of reasons. Firstly, the fiddle-factor at least doubles the length of the FTF game, Secondly,in a game with players of mixed skill levels, the outcome is often determined by the weak players - more so than in the average Euro.  On-line both of these problems are solved.  The fiddliness is gone (games take about 10 minutes per player) and most of the time, all players are strong, so the game results are less dependent on the poor play of the weak.  FTF, it is a good game that I will play occasionally.  On line it is a solid 9.  This is the only Euro I have played on-line more than a time or two... I played about 90 games on line over a 3 month period during 2005 or so.

I've only played it, as a game for 2... but it works very well! 
 
Played as a 3 p game on my PC. It's far much better! If I played it with 3 real, I'd rate it 9,5. 
 
You need to learn how does every building work. No. You don't need to learn. You must remember, to discover your own tactics. It doesn't mean that the game's difficult or something. You just need to play a few times. For me that's just one of the game's pros. 
 
EDIT: After 4p, unfinished gameplay: game's cutthroat. It's very hard to figure out what's the best role to get, when you didn't play for 5 months. Very interesting, nasty decisions. In a 4p game you can see how does your system work. My didn't. 
Edit2: After 4p finished gameplay. Just great! The most intriguing is the interaction.

When your opponents don't try new strategies, or don't try to improve the old ones - this can get a little repetetive. With newbies there is a ,,who's sitting next to whom" syndrome. 
Anyway - great game. Multiple paths to victory. Very, vey good.

EDIT
After 10+ plays - GRRRRREAT!

My favorite Euro (though I've only tried a few). It never gets old and it's always a challenge. Those are both big time statements for any game as far as I'm concerned so I guess I rather like it. 

One thing is for sure: starting out as the second player in a 3-player game can be frustrating.

I finally got my friends, after weening on Ticket to Ride, Dominion, and San Juan, to be able to play Puerto Rico without much problem.  And it is a great game.  We don't care that best play has a scripted opening.  We enjoy trying difference strategies and making tactical plays to screw with each other and the table talk it engenders.  To us, it's fun, not a euro you play with a spreadsheet.

What I used to think: 
Fun game, but for the type of game that it is, I'd rather have Princes of Florence.

What I think now:
The more I play the game, the more I enjoy it.  True, I've only played 3 games with people, but I've been playing a lot of Puerto Rico using Tony Mitton's Excel program, available on BGG.  It's challenging, and while not as much fun as playing with the real bits, you can get through a 5 player game in less than 10 minutes.  While I'm not sure it's the BEST game of all time, I can understand why it's rated that way.

As someone else in these comments said, I don't mind playing the "bad guys" in a board game. I love playing Jack the Ripper in Letters from Whitechapel. But that game makes no bones about who Jack the Ripper was or what he did. Puerto Rico, on the other hand, is a disingenuous take on the history of slavery and slaves (here revised to "colonists"). It provides a simulation of slavery and glorifies the practice from the colonizer's perspective, and that is not a version of history I'd like to participate in. 

Put differently, would you play a game set in the American South, where you play as plantation owners, and to achieve victory, you put black "workers" to work in cotton and tobacco fields? Or a simulation of Nazi death camps, but with the Jews renamed as Untermensch or some other euphemism?

I won't comment on the mechanics, which apparently are timeless. As for the presentation and production quality, it's about as low as you can find for a game in production today. Generic art, or in some cases, no art, just... words in color.

A classic. Worth keeping, even though it's old and been copied innumerable times. Hard to imaging someone not hearing about this, but new players would not find it too difficult to get into, and the strategy would slowly unfold for them, which, I suppose, is the reason for the game's huge popularity.

Rating after 1 play. Adjusted to a 2 rating after article where all 1's and 10's were eliminated. No higher rating is forthcoming because I keep on reading about people who bitch because the NEWBIE spoiled their game by not playing the way that they wanted or expected him/her to play. Any game that is that restrictive doesn't deserve a higher rating.

Love this game with the expansion buildings. We draft between the original and the expansion buildings. Adds more variety. I like the game in that it is easy and relaxing to play after a game of Caverna or Throughout the Ages, yet still is a strategy game with little to no luck involved.  Where you are in game play can be a liability but with the expansion there is ways to combat this. Love this game whether 3,4, or 5 players. Played more times than I can remember.

I love how this game cannot be won or lost by a roll of the dice or a bad shuffle. I'm not keen on there being a "playbook" of optimal plays, nor am I a fan of so many players that will ride your ass for days over a "sub-optimal choice"  -- don't play this game with strangers, and you might yet have a good time with it. For what it is, I like it a lot, as long as I don't have to play with people that take it too seriously.

I don't like the fact that this game doesn't work well with players of unmatched skill.  I also don't like the fact that the game lacks a centralized board; to play well, you have to track all the other players' individual boards, and frankly I find that aspect tiresome.  Furthermore, Puerto Rico's build system requires players to absorb quite a bit of "building trivia" to be able to play well; I think learning that kind of information is completely uninteresting.

In short: yes, it's a generally good game, but I don't get the hype.

Everyone likes it thus far.  The PDF tutorial took some time to have all 4 players review but was well worth the time (we spent more time playing than in the rule book.)  Wife and friends like it and ask for it often.  Tough for me to teach though.  
After many plays over the years, I still want to be in the game if anyone will play. Too bad there isn't a quality 2 player experience like there is for Gric or PoE.

RATING: 6
A good game most of the time, but has balance problems.  Many games are decided half way through, use of the wharf can easily break the game unless all players are expierenced at how to counter this building.

Virtually all games suffer from one classic problem some from two but this game suffers from three!!!

Weakest player: if just one person isn't very familiar with the game or strategic with their moves they disrupt the game and usually spends most of the game throwing points at the person to their left because of the next weakness.

Rummy effect: who sits to your right, and what they do, effects your game as much as what you do!!

Last is the steam roller:  this is where an early lead merely accelerates the growth of a player and in a 5 player game there are rarely more than two or three people in the running half-way through the game.

If you are looking for the best game of this genre try "Princes of Florence," or a newer game, Agricola.

I've played the game only a few times. I'm starting to get the strategy and see my way through the different play styles.

Perhaps that is its biggest issue, the game is somewhat abstract and daunting to see for the first time.

A very efficient game, very much in balance.  It just doesn't have the same magic for me that it seems to have for other players.  I frankly find it too fiddly, and set-up time is too long for a game of its length.  For this reason, I enjoy San Juan much more.  It scratches the same itch yet is easier to set-up and play quickly.

Impression after a few plays.  I can't seem to grasp the winning tactic just yet, but I love the depth and the agonizing choices each turn.  Very refreshing break from the likes of Settlers.  Could improve in rating after I "master" it. =)

UPDATE (12/6/20050):
Surely haven't mastered it yet. Though did win one of two games, got spanked by two newbies last night though...  

UPDATE: 1/1/2006  I've decided to join the rest of the knowing crowd, and declare this one of the best games every made!

Would be a 10 if non-gamers can enjoy it as well.. but it would appear that this is just too complex for some.

Upgrated it to a 10 because it is now my wife's favorite game!

Cerebral, and in many ways better than Agricola, the theme is a little harder for beginners to cope with and this game is a lot more aggressive and confrontational than Agricola.

Definitely a diamond! Easy to learn, hard to master. There are so many combos in the game that you have to play it several dozens times to have a general idea of what to use and when. And the number of combinations increases immensely when you play with the official add-on.

After a few years I maybe will be able to say: I'm good at Puerto Rico. But until then I can just practice and learn on my own mistakes. Must-have for every real geek.

A lot has been said of Puerto Rico. It's indeed a very well balanced game that flows beautifully and fluently. Development is incremental and you can't really point out one single move that got you the victory. Yet it's still possible to make clever and creative moves every now and then. Few different ways of winning is also a bonus.

Playing Puerto Rico is enjoyable and fun, but the slow set-up takes something out of the game. The mechanism of choosing professions isn't that exciting either, so in the end I enjoy most of the other Alea-games better than PR.

I've played this game, and its expansion over 400 times (no exageration, my Brettspielwelt counter shows 335 plays in online plays alone.)  It's subtle, approachable, balanced, and a delight.  Buy it if you don't already have it.  figuring out which role to take and buildings to build keeps the game tactically and strategically interesting.  very little down time.  About the only knock on the game I can think of is when it is played with one new player in a group of experienced players the new player can easily wreck the game balance, but this is a very minor gripe in the scheme of things.

I enjoy playing this game but I have yet to come close to winning.  I must be missing something in the strategy of this game.  I upgraded the building tiles by printing the BGG member art files onto foto paper and then gluing to the original component tiles.

Also a very cool game.  It is easy to play it poorly and difficult to play it well...but the rules are actually pretty straight forward.  There seems to be one dominant strategy, but since the game is mostly tactical it always requires lots of thinking.  Definitely fun.

Based on 3 plays. Found it dry and limiting. Bits were nice but nothing special.  Not much tension or excitement. I don't know how bad things need to be in order for me to try this one again.

Having played this again, I've revised my rating. You'd have to have a gun to my head or the head of a loved one to get me to play this again.

This game holds a very special place in my heart, this was the wife's gateway game.  She still lights up when you mention it.  This is also my first euro style game, and I came to BGG for the first time to learn more about it.  Love the buildings, the worker mechanic, job rotation, and pretty much everything else.  My wife and I are both very competitive people, and for us to both love a game this much that neither of us has ever won is absurd.

RATING: 9
Pros:
* Multiple paths to victory
* Every decision you make is important, and will affect the rest of the game (both for you and the rest of the players)
* You need to predict what the other players are going to do in order to stay competitive
* Of course the whole role-choosing mechanism, and the fact that everyone gets to do something when it's your turn is very interesting
* Very low on luck. 
* Very high level of player interaction.
* I like the modifying or breaking of the rules that come with the purple buildings

Cons:
* Long setup time
* Fairly steep learning curve.
* All the bits, and lack of a central board can look a bit daunting to first-time players
* A beginner might accidentally give too great of an advantage to the player next in line if played with dissimilar player skill levels.
* It is an "optimize your economic efficiency" game. If you don't see the fun in a good optimization puzzle it is likely that you won't like this game either.
* Like most efficiency games, it can be a little "math-y"
* It invites a lot of analysis, scripted "best-moves", and bickering about said "best moves" from optimal play purists. Simply don't play with these people.


There is a lot to take in for the first time player because of all the different houses.  I usually try to explain the key concepts before the game, and then take the houses a few at a time during gameplay (as they start to become affordable). 

There isn't a lot a direct interaction with the other players, and none of it is of the nuke-your-opponents kind. The game is still full of interaction, it's just a more subtle and indirect kind than you might be used to. This is perfectly ok with me, but you might feel differently.

When you are new to the game, the lack of overt conflict has the effect that, it rarely feels like the other players are out to get you; you even get to build your own little empire on a board separate from your opponents. You get to see your strategy through to the end and then see how you did, compared to the others. I think this is a very smart design choice because you have a lot to digest during your first few games even if you focus only on yourself. Of course, as more seasoned players know, you really need to keep an eye on what the others are doing. Half the game is figuring out what all the other players are going to do and play accordingly. Either to mess up their plans or to ride their coattails

During your first plays, you rarely feel like you are in a bad position. Sure, some other player might be earning more money or shipping more goods right now. But you always feel like your own empire economy is just about to get to the next level, putting you in the lead any second now.
After you get more acquainted with the game, you will start to see who is really doing well and who is not. But at this point you will also see _why_ people are in the places they are and can change your play accordingly.

Uneven player experience can be a big problem because the beginner might accidentally give a very big advantage to the next player in line. Try to play with people of similar experience levels. 
Many players also complain that the beginner is playing the "wrong" moves and therefore messing up the game for everyone else. I don't agree with that, simply because I think that messing things up for the other players is a big part of the game. And I would rather see that as a breath of fresh air in a game where everyone else has obviously got stuck in a rut, playing the same moves game after game. 

I think the game scales fairly well and, with the official variant, is even a great 2-player game. With less players you can have more control over what you do and can more easily predict what the other players will do. With more players there is more competition for resources, trading opportunities and shipping space in the cargoships. I think I prefer the 4-player game over the other alternatives, and would say that the 3-player game is the least interesting. The buildings and the strategies associated with them will be better or worse depending on number of players. Turn order will also become more of an issue with more players.

[b]Puerto Rico[/b] [i]Andreas Seyfarth 2002[/i] 
A true gem that was Boardgamegeek number one for more than three years and it is still very well consolidated in the top five. It is indeed a superb design, very easy to explain but rather deep and hard to master. It works like a swiss watch and has mechanics that have been inherited by many other excellent games like San Juan, Twilight Imperium 3 or Race for the Galaxy. Turn order and newbies can affect the game but when all the players have equal level playing it is a fantastic experience. An eurogamer´s dream, and now with its deluxe edition that looks amazing (although it is a bit too pricey) this is one of the best options in the market and a must have in any gamers collection.

Wow, what a disappointment for such a high rated game. Between the sleepy theme and the lack of character interaction I can't fathom why anyone would play this more than a handful of times. I'm so happy that I got my copy free. If you revel in a no (or next to no) luck, all strategy game with no (or next to no) player interaction game that has a considerable setup time to boot, then come on down and play some Puerto Rico.

I'd much rather go to Puerto Rico than play this game. My trips there have been a blast, this game... not so.

RATING: 9
The mechanics of this game are great.  I have the anniversary edition, which I think is worth it for 60 bucks, not for 90 or whatever the MSRP is.

It is best when playing where everyone knows what they are doing, as every choice that someone makes has a pretty big impact on someone else.  So an unknowing player can definitely gift wrap things for the player to their left pretty easily without realizing it.  I do think this is less of a problem than most people thing though, as the trick is to be able to profit from everyone's choices - you might not be the best shipper, or builder, but you can get something done no matter which one people choose.  

This is another game that I have made the mistake of thinking that non-gamers will grasp easily, and it's not.  They can fight through it, but usually it's better to start with something else a little lighter.  Plus, it's a game that definitely rewards good play, and a new player will get hammered, particularly if they aren't used to any sort of game in this genre.

In terms of gameplay, I think it moves along well, and seldom do I see people pouring over a choice.  It is done in 90 minutes, as it states, even if you aren't being a taskmaster about people moving along.  I think it's best with 4-5, but you certainly increase the likelihood of getting screwed, or someone just making a bad play.  3 people is probably the best number to play to see who is the best at this game.

Bottom line - I think it is completely deserving of it's lofty place on the rankings and think it should stay there for a long time.

My first play of PR was somewhat under protest but it was another player's turn to choose the game and I couldn't say anything. I see now why this dusty, old-Euro is a BGG perennial that is only spoken about in the most reverent tones and I'm kind of kicking myself for not trying it sooner. 

PROS
-Length of the game is much shorter than I expected. What little down time existed was due to people being unfamiliar with the building tiles and what they allowed you to do.
-PR keeps everyone involved by the simple fact that if someone takes an action, everyone can take that action.
-Solid player interaction beyond just tile denial. The finite market, the trader, the boats, and the action selection all play a role in making timing and being aware of other players' boards crucial!
-Several ways to rush the end game.

CONS
-It is dreary and boring to look at. Perhaps that anniversary edition would make this better.
-It's a perfect information game, like chess, so there is a perfect move in every situation and, if you don't take it, a more experienced player will beat you.
-CR said that, in his experience and what he's read, the player who is able to buy more of the big bonus tiles will win the game. Don't know if that is true but I won the game and had one or two more than the other players.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Decent mechanics, when taken in the abstract. Because it has so many piece limited items, Puerto Rico has exceptionally common kingmaker actions, especially when played with three players. This means that the winner is more often determined by their ability to manipulate the other players than their own game choices. Most likely you'll either love or hate that Diplomacy like aspect of the game. The omnipresent piece limitations also mean that many of the paths to victory will be foreclosed to many players, making execution more important than planning. I feel the game end arrives too unpredictably, others think this is a feature. The largest mechanical fault is that a few buildings are poorly balanced, apparently just for the sake of clean progressions of numbers. Some of the setup is fiddly too (e.g. counting out large piles of counters). If the people I've played with are any indication, the first turn is "solved" so you can save five minutes by distributing those resources as soon as the first player is chosen.

I usually don't put too much stock in themes, but in this case the theme actively works against the mechanics. Players are punished for building sustainable colonies, but rewarded for colonies that peak early, even if they are likely to collapse. This cognitive dissonance often causes new players to do poorly, and I've found that the best advice for newbies is to pointedly ignore the names and other theme elements, and pretend the game is completely abstract like Blokus. I may be old-fashioned, but I think an important (the most important?) function for a theme is to make the game accessible to new players. When the theme makes the game harder to play the game should have been left abstract. I also find the short-sighted thinking Puerto Rico encourages annoying, and don't like games that teach this self-destructive personal trait; however, much of that is inherent in the colonization theme - an inherently long-term business. With a different theme (or no theme), the mechanics might not feel like they reward short-sightedness.

Brilliant game.  The changing phase mechanic makes the game so interesting.  One of the most subtle games I have ever played in terms of the effect of various actions.  Also games are almost always close, even in 5 players it is common to only have 10 or so points between first and fifth.

Update:  In recent times I find myself enjoying this less and less - mostly because thematically and component wise it is very uninteresting.  The gameplay is solid but it doesn't hold my interest much any more.

RATING: 8
Well-crafted game that initially rated a 9 for me.  The growth of the individual colonies makes for a constructive, friendly atmosphere, yet the player interaction is rich and challenging.  I knocked the rating down to an 8 because I've burnt out on the game, and am reluctant to play it these days.  Heavy play reveals the building choices to be more restricted than they should be, with several of the buildings rarely or never built by veteran players.  The solution is to incorporate some of the more useful buildings from the expansion (but avoid the gamebreakers Union Hall and Forest House).  My other criticism of Puerto Rico is that an experienced player will obliterate a table of new players, making the game demoralizing for the novices and un-fun for the veteran.  For this problem there is no real solution other than playing with those of equal experience or perhaps trying out goofy strategies when playing with less experienced players; try to keep things very lighthearted in these situations.

This game looks boring. Period. I bought it simply because of the high reviews and rankings. I'm glad I did.

Its a well balanced euro style game that doesn't punish you and keeps you guessing as to what your opponents will do next. There isn't much table talk during this one but its still very fun.

If your face turns red with anger over failed dice rolls, a game like PR is the way to go. I find, however, that a complete elimination of luck has also killed an element of surprise that adds to the fun of boardgames. Don't get me wrong, dice scare me just as much as the next gamer, but this game seems to be missing something and that is what I can come up with.

Still...7 is a fantastic score. Great game. The roles are fabulous, the number of choices is very exciting. This game is actually rather new to me, however, and as I play it more, I expect my opinion of it to grow rather than wane.

12/2009: I think I was wrong. My opinion is staying the same. I just don't know how I feel about a game where you are sometimes trying to decide which actions you need to avoid because it will give the players after you a distinct advantage. Big problem when playing with people that concentrate solely on what they are trying to accomplish. It is just too frustrating to watch people choose 'Craftsman' when the player to their left will score so many points if they do.

I think this game deserves its high praise it has been given on this site as I keep coming back to this game from time to time. Even if there are only two main strategies in the game (buildings and shipping), there are almost endless possibilities to tweak them. The interaction in the game is indirect, but very apparent through the role selection (which is used in a very good way in this game). There is very little randomness to the game, but still the games play out very differently and you have to adjust your strategy to the decisions other player makes.

I rather play this game with casual players than with experienced players that complain about that the inexperienced player helped the player to the left. The criticism of the game is valid, but it is not fun playing with moaning players. It’s only a game.

The game plays well with any number of players I have played with, which is three, four and five players.

Really, really good game. One that I failed miserably at, but I can tell that the game has a lot of secrets to unlock and great replayability. Plus, the player interaction is surprisingly high for a euro, so where you ship and what you trade (and when) really determines what other players can (and cannot) do. Especially in a five player game. I really enjoyed this one and I think it could rise further upon subsequent plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Seven plays. The positives are obvious: there's lots to think about and in between games you can try to work out your strategy for next time. On the negative side, I don't care for heavy perfect-information games where everything can be mapped out and the game is only about processing information. I like there to be some little bit of surprise or the unexpected in games, and I don't mean blind randomness...I mean situations when temperament has some bearing on play, when you don't necessarily know how your opponents are going to react. Also, the attitude of the other players makes a huge impact on how fun the experience is for me; playing with intense people who get bent out of shape if someone makes a bad move is not my idea of a good time. All in all, the good things and the bad things average out to a rating of seven and a half. 

By the way, I really like Thi Nguyen's comments on the game: "No soul, no guts...just analysis, analysis, analysis. Don't get me wrong, I love me my look-ahead. But games like Go, games like El Grande, there's openness, there's wildness, there's maneuvering room."
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
One of the first more "euro" of the euro games that I played/owned. I like the level of complexity that the play offers - it being complex enough to allow for relatively oblique strategies, but simple enough that you can analyze another players situation/moves without it taking forever. A very strategic, fun, and easy game. The only thing that counts against it in my mind are the thematic elements, which appear dry and unimportant therefore almost rendering this a game of "white bits" and "yellow bits" instead of "sugar" and "corn".

2004 acquisition.  First heard of the game after I discovered BBG.  Have read the rules and now waiting for the right time to introduce it to my better half.

7 years on in 2011, we played our first game!

We've only been playing 2-player games so far.  The rules are of moderate complexity but once you've played it, the game makes sense.  There's a fair bit of screwage, for example when you pick the captain role when the opponent can't ship and thus the goods have to be wasted.  Personally, this is a better game than Agricola due to the fact that the Mrs likes it much better than Agricola and so the chance of it hitting the table is infinitely higher!

Este juego es sumamente bueno, se asemeja bastante a la realidad en cuanto a elección de opciones a la hora de crear un pueblo/ciudad que cree materias primas y las trabaje. Esta realidad que tiene lo hace bastante complicado en cuanto a reglas y en la jugabilidad ya que muchas veces uno no sabe qué hacer y termina eligiendo la que le da menos al resto.
Bajo mi visión, que sea tan complejo y que no tenga una temática tan llamativa, hace difícil de jugar ya que no logro encontrar las personas que quieran probarlo/jugarlo. Pero el juego es MUY bueno si uno lo aprende bien.

Who needs San Juan when there is Puerto Rico? The only downfall is that the building tiles consist of text only (unlike some homemade sets or San Juan which got beautiful graphics). I don't like the "game ends" rules which end the game very abruptely when it gets going. Furthermore I consider variable turn order as an important balancing feature (see Caylus, Age of Steam, Agricola), PR is static to the turn order which makes it prone to be abused by experienced players. Sorry that I had to downrate this game continuarly (it started with an 8) and also because it seems that there are two dominant victory strategies (shipping and building). Even more, there are too many unthematic restrictions by the rules. It's hard to understand for me why this average game was for years on top of BGG.

This used to be my favorite game until playing Power Grid.  It has great mechanics, and I like how the roles all interact with each other.

Played 20+  I like it best with 4 or 5 players. My appreciation of Puerto Rico has varied over time. It took me half a dozen games to get into it during this phase I would rate the game a 7. The game then fascinated me for the next half dozen plays where my interest peaked at a 10. I am now down the other side of the enjoyment curve; I do not enjoy the mood of play with everyone frustrated when another player does not make the play they had counted on them making. This is a heavy weight, 90 minute strategy game, my ideal category of game. The main reason this game now holds up in my rating is because it is easy to find experience willing players. If the gaming community put the same efforts into Amen Re, Taj Mahal and Princes of Florence these games would push ahead of Puerto Rico in my estimation. May 04

A phenomenal game for 2002, because it defined the worker placement genre.

I like the role selection.  It gives you great options to hose over other players.  For example, you can find yourself in a great position where you are the only one to benefit from your selection, plus you get your bonus.  It's also interesting to try and synergize your building and plantation selections.

The art is a little bland and the chits seem thin compared to standards of current games.  Gameplay is overall dry, but has more interaction than I think it's given credit for, due to the interaction of choices on other players options.  

  It probably doesn't have the replayability of it's prime BGG competitor Agricola, due to Agri's large variety of card decks.  
Still, I almost think I enjoy Puerto slightly better.  

That being said, I prefer Galactic Emperor's implementation of role selection and as such, don't see myself ever purchasing Puerto unless on deep discount.

I've played many games of this live, but got burned out on BSW. I do think it is good, but when moves become programmed it loses the feel of an actual game. I especially hate the elitest newbie-bashing that it seems to engender. I much prefer Princes of Florence or even San Juan. **UPDATE** Played it again after a very long hiatus, because I wanted to introduce the "classic" to some who haven't played. It is a very good game, but my old fears still remain. Because I was so much more familiar with the buildings and roles and interactions in the game, I had a decided advantage. The game was still close, however. Most of the players are eager to try it again now that they "get it" from going through an initial game.

Asked for Puerto Rico for Christmas based on high rating on BGG and was not disappointed. My brother/sister in law ordered the game for my mother in law and my SIL had to fend off my BIL from opening and playing it.

Interesting, but not impressive. Maybe I didn't played it in good conditions.
The "politically correct" side on the name "colonists" ("Settlers"? I played the french version and don't know the translation) made me and my gf laugh (she is from Martinique, a Carribean Island and well aware of this part of History).

Good game, well made, simple to understand, not so easy to win though. :)

There is enough in the basic game to keep you occupied for months of gaming! I haven't seen one game that was the same twice yet.

I have traded it because of its only weakness, you need at least three players to play (and maybe I should say four because with three players you only touch the tip of the iceberg).

Great game, but bad English translations lead to many incorrect plays.  Also, starting balance is often issue of contention.  The only notable negative is that a weaker player ruins the balance of the rest of the players.  Setup and take down is more than I would like.  Really it is a GREAT game, but loses rating points because Race for the Galaxy does it better.

I was introduced to Puerto Rico at Gamers of Winter con in 2010. I didn't even finish the first game of it, but played enough to know I wanted to own it. It's one of the "elderly" games in our collection now, but it still gets pulled out and played fairly often.

I'm with the folks who think this game is like a fine watch - the pieces of the system work well together. And for me a well designed system is very important to a serious game. Filler games can have flaws, but an entree should be well prepared.

This is one of those games where you want to take 2 or 3 actions on your turn, but must choose only one (role).

I think this copy is first edition (2002) as shown in version choice, but not sure what's different in second edition.

Played a few times in the first few years after PR was published, but haven't played much recently. San Juan is a more practical (time/portability) choice. I do like how it is fairly straightforward to teach PR to someone who knows SJ.

So many strategic options, it's hard to get my mind around all of them. I've only played a couple of times but this is definitely one of the most challenging multi-option games I've encountered. The setup time is crippling if you don't have two hours to devote to a play session. But if you have the time it's very well worth the time investment.

I love how, in contrast to games like Settlers, you always have something to do (no waiting for your turn, or your number to come up), so it moves at a pretty fast pace. Interaction seems just right for this type of game.

First rate after four plays: 8.5

May 8th, 2009: after five plays my rate goes up to 9. I expect it to go it even higher once I learn strategies more complex than shipping corn.

May 26th, 2009: the rating goes up to 9.5. I love how the game unfolds, when you start with a little and end up with a plantation that works like a clockwork mechanism. Best game ever?

22nd August 2009: I am updating my rates so that they would be in compliance with BGG rating scale. Rate down to 8.

21st February 2010: Got bored little bit with it. It's a good introductory game and will hit the table relatively often as friends of ours do love this title, but I myself am very far from being the biggest fan of this one.

I understand why some people (but not why so many) love it, but I really dislike how much you are affected by other players' actions. It's nice if players are around the same skill level, but the game can be totally spoiled by a weaker player. Coupled with the extremely dull theme and lack of visual appeal, that gives me very little desire to play it again.

RATING: 4
I just do not see the "deep strategy" that many other seem to think is in this game.  Over the course of an average game there might be two interesting decisions to make; the rest of the time the game plays itself.  Everyone has their own board and victory-point chips are hidden, so it's extremely difficult to tell who's in the lead at any time.  For a game with limited player interactivity this is disastrous.  It turns what might be an interesting sort of race into an I-don't-care-let's-just-finish-this-damned-thing trudge.

The winner is almost always a surprise and the point spreads are always tiny, even when someone seemed to be clearly ahead or playing better than others the whole game.  It's not clear to me just why this is, but it makes the game totally unsatisfying to win.  The game ends, everyone counts their chips and buildings and whatever, and whoever wins is like, "oh... I guess I won.  Ok."  No sense of accomplishment because it's not clear why you won.

The result is a muddled, arbitrary mess.

And if you're going to whitewash a game about slavery by calling the slaves "colonists," at least represent the "colonists" with markers that aren't dark brown.  I mean come on, people!

A game that lives up to its hype.  

The role choosing mechanic works very well and the balance of choices, resources, and opportunity makes for some very interesting decisions.  A forced awareness of each other player and their goals brings this game out of multiplayer solitaire territory and creates an interactive experience that is still rare in many engine building and resource gathering games that have come since.

What more can be said--so well designed it hurts. The mechanics are fine-tuned within an inch of their lives. I use it as a gateway game, believe it or not--you can just jump right in and explain things as they come up.

Another overrated game on the geek. While it´s a good game it has it´s (partly big) flaws.

After many many years, I played it again, just to recheck my older imperssions. Well, it didn't change. My main concern is, that you don't play the game, but the game plays you. There's just not as much influence and strategic choices as people say. On your turn, let's say you got 3 remaining role cards and around 80% of the time, the best choice is immediately given. You rarely need to think what's best, unless you are first and need to be aware of the other players boards, but that doesn't happen each round.
It may even happen, that you can't do anything good at all, when all the roles were used before you had the chance.

It's a good game, but nowhere near the top 10.

Regarding the weight, the game once played is not really heavy and pretty straight forward, but there is a learning curve to learn the rules which might turn some away.

The game is fun, but I am not seeing the potential for numerous different strategies at this time having only played it a handful of times with two players.  It is fun with two, but the decision making (strategy) seems limited.

Its a fun game overall and look forward to playing it with more people.

A good game which I think most anyone can get behind.  However, It may not be everyone's cup of tea or the end all in any particular category.  After the first play it's pretty simple to grasp.

Overall, a solid game.

31.07.14: Just replayed for the first time in maybe four years. Still a superb game, does engine building with minimal fuss but great interest, role selection makes it constantly involving. I felt bad getting up from the table to go buy a drink. Deserves the 9 its been on for the past four years.

This game is an acquired taste, but one that is oh so worth acquiring. It takes a few plays to see just how well all the different mechanics work together rather than just seeming like a themeless mishmash. Granted, theme is a place this game suffers; it feels very dry and sometimes more like an optimization exercise than shipping goods, but after several plays, my rating has increased. It is a lot more elegant than I intially gave it credit for, and the learning curve to do well is not as great as I first thought.

I've got to remember to use the factory strategy more often -- it gives you bonus doubloons even when other people take the craftsman.  Also, I should always buy the Guild Hall first of all the big buildings, because it's worth a lot of points to anybody (whereas others might be worth only 4 or 5 points).  Remember that the production buildings are cheap (3 doubloons for a large indigo plant == 4 points with the Guild Hall, which are the cheapest points you can earn in the game) and plentiful (they can't run out in a 3-player game, and rarely run out with more players), so even if you don't have the production buildings when you buy the Guild Hall, you can obtain them quickly enough.

A good 'gamey game' with a stronger adherence to theme than most. Players choose strategies based on selection of crops and buildings. Resource scarcity of both of these items and also scarcity of shipping, production and trading means a careful eye has to be kept on what other players are doing. 
Can be fiddly to setup (lots of bits metered out in exact quantities).

Another one of those games I played a lot when I first bought it. However, I don't think it has much replay value after the first six times or so. If you shelve it for long periods and come back to it, it's tolerable, and certainly it's quite good those first six times or so. Frankly the best thing that can be said about it is that it makes a reasonable game to introduce people to Euros with.

What can I say about Puerto Rico that hasn’t been said already? For me Puerto Rico was the game that introduced me to a world of middle-to-heavy Euro Games (like many others, Carcassonne and Settlers were my entry point back into gaming). I immediately fell in love with flow of the game, the simple enough rules with complex, highly interactional results. I know that some folks have played so many games that it seems scripted, however I’m nowhere near there yet (I’m imagining that I’m likely to be somewhere in the 20-30 games range as I played a fair amount before I began logging plays here) and the game continues to reveal interesting tactical possibilities and responsive strategies. My only gripe about this game ten years after it came out is that it’s highly functional components don’t quite stack up to most games aesthetically – although I prefer a good game to a pretty one if it ever comes down to it.

RATING: 9
Oooh, so close to a 10. I've played too many people who are VERY good (I'm not). It soon becomes clear that there are certain formulaic paths that lead to victory, hardly noughts and crossses broken but just knowing that another player is making almost yawn-worthy no-choice decisions is enough to drop it to 9.
Don't be fooled by this rather critical comment though it's a supremely beautifully crafted game. It's almost as if the shine has gone off it and led to a bit of disappointment.
Buy it, play it about 30 times, try not to take it too seriously and you'll love every game. Just steer clear of mathematicians who have played it too much.

I do not understand why this game is so highly rated. I find it okay to play and sometimes can be persuaded to bring it to the table but it is fairly dull and slow. There are one or two obvious strategies that tend to guarantee victory and consequently it has little replay value. 

In short, an okay game but suitable only as a filler.

Took me way longer to get into this classic than i care to admit, but glad i finally did. As any euro is with me, took me about 2-3 turns to figure out what i'm supposed to be doing and how everything works with the buildings. I now understand why this is viewed as a gateway to role selection and evergreen in the industry. Super smooth, and while i've only had a limited amount of plays i can tell there are numerous strategies one could use to win.

I haven't played enough to  be sick of this game yet, and at ~40 plays, that's a very strong endorsement.

Teaching games are less fun, which is common to many games,  but is pronounced here.

The design is quite brilliant. At its heart is a particularly ingenious mechanic - every player performs actions on everyone else's turn. The elegance of the game's core is diminished by having to track all the special powers associated with the different buildings and how they interact. Nonetheless, a wealth of strategic decisions and constant competition for scarce resources make for compelling and tense fun.

A true Strategist game!

Player pick turns on different roles. Each role gives player bonus and other players play the same role what the player chose.

RATING: 7.6
It has some neat aspects as i love RFTG i can see why Puerto Rico is his grandfather, and i can see why this one is so popular. I like this game, however it can be too long for my taste, but after all this is just my first impressions. I think the rating might go up a bit later, however im sure already this won't be my favorite game. It has cool artwork, and an average theme, im looking forward to play it more. After a few more games i think the game lacks of the needed interaction and can become boring so qickly. The game has a ton of components while the price is relativly low, but im still not sure if i like it enough to keep in my collection or it will be just a game on the shelf that will be never played again. Well the answer what only time will tell... Im surprised this game is the top6 strategy board game of all time, what? This is kind of a joke i guess, maybe my taste is so much different than the average.

Pros / Cons:
-It is a deep strategy game, where you have to think over the situations. While the rules are relatively easy to teach.
-The role selections with some bonuses are always welcome.

-The game became boring after 1 offline + 4 online plays. It was a great game when it came out, but the time ran over it. Thats all.
-The lack of interaction between the players kills the fun for me.

OK, first home solo play and I remember a lot fo the good things about this game better now. First play on a friend's copy and I enjoyed it then too (though in hindsight I was probably one of those newbies who unintentionally helped the person on the right).

That said, for a role selection game there are am lot of interesting choices and it can make for a very tight game at times (49-47-42-37, on 1st home solo 4-player).

It IS susceptible to accidental king-making, but the decisions are interactive ("He's not likely to choose that, so...", or, "If I take that I'll deserve the pain it causes me, better go with the Prospector."), and the actual thinking is light enough that it's not too susceptible to AP.

Still a great game. +0.5 to 7.5.

As a house rule (along with the expansions) I have reduced the cost of the University by 2.  

As an aside, I have downloaded the graphics files to add San Juan style pictures on the buildings, and added a few fan expansions to bring it up to 6 players.  I like the look of the buildings, and wish that this would have been added from the start!

Excellent game! Discovered BGG after playing Catan. Puerto Rico was rated #1 at the time. We bought it and mind blown. It’s a bit hard to get to the table in our house but when we do, very enjoyable.

There are a few things that have lowered the rating for me:

-It plays really badly with players of varied experience/skill.

I hated this game when I first was taught how to play it, as I was new to Eruos and new to the "new" generation of German-style boardgames (grew up with AH games). I didn't know what was going on, as the 'pick a role' mechanic was new to me, and got destroyed several times over. Several years later, I bought the game, read the rules, and introduced it to a new bunch of friends who were new to gaming--they loved it. So, with the right people--analytical types--this can be an effective gateway game. Over time, the nearly perfect information leads to stereotypical opening play, like chess, and the comments about weak players becoming kingmakers is true. This is an unforgiving game--with plenty of opportunity to exploit your opponents' mistakes, or have yourself screwed with--and it is difficult to realize you are losing, badly, until the end. With players of similar experience, this can be a fun game.

Update (4/05/09): upping this to a '9', after playing with five players who know how to play the game--so there was no downtime, makes for quick, snappy play.

Update (12/26/10) 16 plays: 2x plays with Expansion II buildings and nobles (no entry yet). Newest expansion adds yet even more variety, with a new mechanism through nobles. The game feels fuller with more colonists available, and nobles add interesting twists. Highly recommended expansion, and I much prefer it to Expansion I.

Update (02/10/13) 21 plays: It's frustrating to know the game is already determined by who is sitting to the left of the weakest player. I don't have the heart to play anymore, given the weakest player is the one suggesting the game--Uh, no thanks. It's a great design, but very fragile with uneven player skills, and that is its biggest flaw. Dropping the rating to a '7'.

This game is the one that, for me, defined what a good euro game is all about. Extremely skill based and with no luck except seating involved, it's still one of my favorite games. It's aged extremely well, even though gamers used to contemporary design tend to complain about the lack of iconography.

Good game, but not sure if it is worthy of all the hype.  Takes a LOOOONNNNGGGG time to play and at its core, it is really just a variation on Settlers (build to get resources to build more to get more resources.)  Beginning to think that most Euros are the same game.  Theme is pasted on.  Could just as easily be the Antebellum South or a space colony or whatever.  Need more theme/flavor/RPG-ness in my games.

Ein solides Strategiespiel. Ich persönlich sehe den Vorteil am Rollselection-Mechanismus vor allem darin, dass enorm wenig Downtime entsteht. Jeder ist in den Zug der anderen involviert. Auf der anderen Seite finde ich gerade diesen Mechanismus enorm anstrengend, da ich mich über eine ganze Weile nicht nur auf mein, sondern auch auf das Spiel meiner Mitspieler konzentrieren muss, um mit der Wahl meiner Aktion nicht meinen Gegnern Vorteile zu verschaffen. Darüberhinaus finde ich was neben diesem Mechanismus passiert relativ uninspiriert. Angesichts des Alters dieses Spiels muss man ihm jedoch zugute halten, dass damals weit weniger Eurogames mit derartigem Resourcenmanagement im Umlauf waren. Zusammenfassend könnte man sagen: Puerto Rico ist in Würde gealtert.

A really fun game, and my family's entry into "real" tabletop gaming. As a native from Puerto Rico, I think the "implied racism" is a load of crap. It's *historically accurate* so if you want to be that much a stickler, stop playing WW2 games that make the Germans the bad guys.

Theme doesn't grab me and it's not a game I would probably play to the point where I could blame others 'poor' decisions for my end of game result. I bumped this up a few tenths now that I've played it a bit more and understand it better. I still wouldn't want to play against experts and I think the factory strategy seems a bit too powerful with our group think. I find the expansion enjoyable to mix things up and make play a little less scripted.

RATING: 10
PRO:
- challenging, fun gameplay
- introduces the concept of taking roles
- no direct player interaction, but still you have a lot of possibilities to influence your opponents
- starts off slowly, but more and more possibilities open up when the game goes on
- hidden victory points (partly)

CONTRA:
- unattractive looks (lots of text, almost no art)
- an "irrational" move by another player can ruin it for you
- some downtime when players ponder over their best possible move

VERDICT:
Slow at times, rather boring to look at, but nevertheless a game that deserves such a high rating. The competition is tense, the gameplay is fun, great game!

Great game of commerce and sheer fun to play.  This is the game that turned me into a gaming hobbyist.  Very well designed and not too heavy so it has wide appeal.  We love it at my house.  My only gripe about the game is the effect the turn order has on the outcome.  Someone who picks production sets the next guy up to score big with the delivery phase.  Somewhat of a kingmaking aspect.

I have played at least 50 games of the computer version as well.  This is a great game.  There are many paths to victory with minimal luck involved.  The official two player varient is very good.

This game is lots and lots of fun.

There was a long period where I loved this game (and have a lot of plays). I still respect it, but I don't really want to play it that much anymore. While there used to feel like a lot of possibilities, to me it now seems maximization of a few choices. I guess, not enough chaos for my tastes.

When I played with this game for the first time I felt a bit weird, it just didn`t clicked for me, I heard a lot of good things about this game, but after the first 8-10 rounds I just didn`t get it, I asked the question from myself. This was the nr. 1 on BGG, why??

Finally, in the last rounds of the game and after the points couting I understood why this game is so great. It`s an elegant game what is quite simple to learn, but the depth of this game is huuuge. I really like it.

Puerto Rico could really use little player aids for the buildings, because there is a bunch of it and it`s hard to memorize at the first few plays.

No, it isn't perfect.  Some of the buildings are too good for their cost and some aren't good enough, but the core rules for the game are excellent.

Great classic game. Clever design. 

Side note: Puerto Rico is slightly too complex to appeal to a general casual gamer - but few of my friends, who are not into gaming that much, do play and enjoy it. I guess this is because parts in this game are inter-connected in a smart way that also makes sense. As a result, I enjoy teaching the rules more than I do for Keyflower - a game of considerably similar weight, for example.

My favourite Euro. As a game with very little randomness all the interest lies in the interaction between the choices of player roles, with a chess-like combination of tactics and strategy required to play well. I wouldn't call it quite perfect: if I were developer I'd recommend changing the purchase prices of some buildings (I always think that Construction Hut should cost 1 Dubloon and Small Market 2, for example), and inducting new players should be done via training games as sub-optimal play introduces a chaos element that's impossible to overcome. However, this is a genuine classic that should be played for generations to come.

Puerto Rico is finally starting to grow on me.  Now that I have a better understanding of how it actually works, it's a nice quick game that packs a lot of decisions and a reasonable amount of depth into a 60-90 minute game, so that's nice.  There are more different ways to go than I originally suspected and it's possible to pivot and do different things. Whatever, you don't need me to give you an explanation of Puerto Rico, but I've been enjoying it quite a bit lately.

Great game. Incredibly intelligent game design. In terms of euros this is as good as it gets, at least for me. I rate it a ten, but whether I would really choose this game over some of the wargames in this category is questionable, but I think it fills its niche perfectly, takes 90 minutes to play and provides wonderful depth and plays 3-5 players. The only problem I have with it is the blind vp, but sometime I can convince people to play with open vp.

update: I have been playing a bunch of this with the Evolver spreadsheet for excel. It is a great way to test out a few strategies.

A painful, boring, dull, dry experience with 5 players.  If you play with experts then expect to lose and learn nothing in the process.  Play with a similar experience level and you may get something out of this overly complicated efficiency engine game.  Loved by many, but God alone knows why.

Theme and mechanics don't go together but the mechanics do at least all work, if a bit clunky with the "you can only sell one of each kind of good" shop and the "you can only fill up the ship with one type of good" fleets.

There are better games out there; there really are.

Played this game several times and I think it is one of the best games ever!  I was able to play a pick up game at Gen Con and despite the fact I thought I was getting schooled in the game, it turned out that I missed first by 1 victory point.  Dang Nabit!  I have a tendency to concentrate on making money than actually gererating victory points.

The rules are simpler (and easier to teach) than they might look. It has huge strategic depth that makes me forget the otherwise simple but maybe boring mechanic of variable phase order and role selection.

I prefer it over Agricola because it is simpler (in things to learn) while being more complex (in things you can do).

One of the most well-crafted board games in existence. It doesn't matter if the rules make no sense, it all works once you figure it out and forget about realism. Just produce some goods, process them, ship them for VP, and have a grand old time being the governor once in a while. Maybe I've just played it too much and am stuck in my own little world, but I like this game quite a bit.

Lo sobrevaloré en exceso. Es un juego que se basa en un algoritmo: una vez que lo descubres, los primeros turnos se realizan de manera mecánica… hasta que alguno comete un error.  Las decisiones a tomar en cada turno son muy limitadas o muy evidentes… con la única excepción de qué construir. Eso me aburre. Reconozco sus logros en la fluidez del juego y en sus mecánicas originales (elección de roles, tableros personales y edificios que no son sino “excepciones a las reglas generales”). Sólo lo juego con gente poco jugona porque me sorprende más. Clara ventaja del cuarto jugador y de quien esté sentado a la izquierda del novato.

Il gestionale per eccellenza, dove ad ogni turno si sceglie - ad eliminazione progressiva - un’abilità da sfruttare, facendo molta attenzione a non lasciare agli altri, quella a loro favorevole. Molti i modi diversi per vincere, ma è soprattutto necessario riuscire a valutar bene la posizione relativa di tutti i giocatori, non permettendo ad alcun avversario di prendere il largo. Una volta appreso, scorre molto bene e a fine partita è possibile valutare dove si è sbagliato, per poi imparare dai propri errori.

The #1 classic and for good reason.  Was the first real "gamers game" we played since becoming part of the geek.  Pretty much sparked my interest in Eurogames.  Anyone who hasnt played it should so they know what the hype is about.

This game was actually played 2 or 3 times a week for months when we got it.  Not quite a 10 anymore because it does get scripted after a while and we actually rarely play it, but i think that is just because i have so many games now.

Awesome gateway game. I like it better with 3, but it still very good with 4 or 5. The 2 player variant is also great. 
This game is not that deep but it is very well balanced and strategies are easy to grasp after a few plays. 

The only flaw of this game is the kingmaking aspect due the order of play. It is likely for a bad player to benefit the better one who plays immediately after. 

Puerto Rico is an amazing acomplishment. If people would buy it instead of Monopoly we would live in a better world. :D

RATING: 5
Call me a hater but I don't like the theme of this game since I find it plain boring. The mechanics are the synonymous of the Euro-style and therefore they are too mechanical and competitive for me in an extreme Chess-like manner. I much prefer Contract-Bridge-like hidden elements interaction like in Twilight Struggle or War of the Ring. You just too simply grab things for you: want a colonist? You have them. Want a building? There is surely one for your budget. Want a plantation? No problem. Take it. Grab, grab, grab.
No sense of any epic just shipping goods to the Homeland with plenty of strategy behind. So 5 for the deep strategy and only 5 for the boredom of theme.

Played maybe 10 times before 1/24/08. Taught in 15 min, played in ~2 hrs for 1st time. This game has many choices & has good luck/strategy ratio. Each player begins w/ $3 & 1 indigo or corn plantation (others are: sugar, tobacco, & coffee) A player is elected governor & gets 1st choice of roles. Roles are(special ability; all action): Prospector($1; n/a), Builder(-$1 cost; buy 1 building), Trader(sell good 1st; sell unique goods for $ until all pass, cleared if full), Craftsman(extra good; produce goods for each worker plantation/building, corn requires no building), Captain(extra VP, ship goods for VPs to 1 of 3 ships going clockwise until all pass, clear full ships), Mayor(extra worker, worker distributed clockwise, refilled based on empty buildings, min # of players), & Settler(may choose quarry [-$1 building]; choose 1 plantation). After each player chooses a role & actions are taken, place $1 on remaining roles & pass governor to left. Game ends: run out of VPs, workers, or building space. Most VPs wins. Buildings produce goods(w/matching plantation), give you special actions &/or produce VPs. Strongly recommended play w/ owner or borrowed. Otherwise give purchase consideration & a place in your rotation of games to play.

So, we finally got around to playing this.  It took a little extra time to learn how everything worked, but it's not too complicated after you play a few rounds.  We played with the 2 player variant and it seemed pretty well done. We enjoyed the game, however, about 2/3 of the way through the game, my husband took a second tobacco mill.  We didn't realize you can only have one and it really unbalanced the game in his favor.  We'll have to try again now that we know the rules better.

-------------------------------

[i]Puerto Rico[/i] is a game about developing plantations on the island of Puerto Rico during the colonisation era, and attempting to profit by using colonists to build refineries, town buildings, and crop plantation. This game caters for 3-5 players, though there is an unofficial expansion which lets you play with 2. The game scales well for all levels of players, with there being almost no difference between the different amounts. It is not a light game, and has many routes to victory.

The main mechanism behind [i]Puerto Rico[/i] is a role selection one where each player chooses a role to taken within the colony. Everyone gets to take an action associated with that role, but the player who chose it gets a special privilege. Having chosen a role, the effect can be used to build buildings, plantations, ship goods, or other colonial actions. The aim of the game is to accumulate victory points, which you get primarily from shipping. Everything else should be towards this aim. And that is also this game’s great strength; it allows you a lot of leeway in how you go about this goal. It lets you create your own economic engine from scratch, a task that requires a lot of planning and tactical ability: strategy in order to find out what to work towards, and tactics to determine how you can take advantage of your opponents’ position. And yes, there is a great amount of player interaction in [i]Puerto Rico[/i], and much can be said for disadvantaging yourself in order to ruin someone else’s plans.

The one thing that I do not like about [i]Puerto Rico[/i] is how much you are constricted to a single strategy. If you make bad choices in the beginning, you will have to run with them for the remainder of the game. The high scarcity and short playing time ensure this. This stifles new strategies, I find, and makes it hard for newer players to know what to do and compete.

In conclusion, [i]Puerto Rico[/i] is an excellently designed game, and allows you great scope in determining your own strategy with minimal luck. The variable player scale makes it a good fit for most occasions, and the planning makes it a good brain-burner. There are no flaws I can find in the gameplay, and I have not noticed the supposed advantages of sitting near a new player, likely because my group started at the same skill level.

[b]Pros[/b]
- Multiple paths to victory
- Room for strategic planning
- Almost no luck at all
- Supports a good amount of people

[b]Cons[/b]
- Can be unforgiving
- Definite learning curve
- Very tight with regards to opportunity

One of the most accessible, and most replayable games ever made.  No waiting for turns,constant choices, and the feeling that you always have a chance to win makes this game one of the best Euro style games ever. P.S. When did these become Euro style rather than Germanspielen?

1. Only played with 2. But the game is oke. Should be more fun with more! 

2. After playing the game a couple of more times i begin to appriciate it. Altho it will never be my favorite game cus i think it lacks a bit interaction but,...its still no game that i would turn down on a nice evening. :) 

We mostly played it with 2 persons and that works pretty good. Also with 4 persons the game is good!

When we tried the game with 3 we discovered that you have to use a copletely different strategy to keep the game interesting. Maybe we just need to practice more with 3, but we all agreed after a couple of times that it was better played by 2 or 4.

Among uber-geeks the game is a pain to play because they've overstudied it so much it's like a friggin chess opening. With ordinary people it still holds interest. With people who are PR-geeks, no, it totally sucks. Not because of the game itself, but because of the fan base it's attracted. Suffers from a very perilous opening. If you make the right scripted moves for the first two turns, you can win. If you make one single mistake, you lose.

I played Caylus and had no trouble discerning strategies or seeing what I did wrong and where, etc.  -But this game left me feeling really stupid, like the level of dumbfoundedness akin to taking a diagnostic math test after a long, wild summer and staring at a simple equation that for all practical purposes you SHOULD know...but you don't and you sit there feeling inadequate.  I need a few more plays to get a grip on it.  Maybe playing late on a Friday didn't help much...Oi.

Update:  I still suck and have no qualms with that, however, the game is painfully boring in my opinion.  I really could care less how many little yellow barrels I need to shove on a ship to get some convulted token of forward progress.

Now that is one fantastic Euro-game! Nice components, streamlined mechanics and a way to keep all the players all the time (downtime is next to none). Sure, die-hard strategist whine about some unfair advantages a good seat can give you, but still, so much fun comes from just playing this game, that it brings a lot of joy even if you do not win. My only gripe with the game is that sometimes it just feels too short - it suddenly stops when everyone was still having so much fun!

I wasn't that impressed with the game.  The strategy seemed really abstract and last time I played someone who didn't even know what they ere doing won.  Also, theme is lame. It doesn't even make sense that all players control a parallel universe puerto rico?

I can respect this holding #1.  It lacks some elegance, and has a lot of bits, but the gameplay is on a level of it's own.

My favorite feature is the almost complete lack of noticeable downtime since you are always interested in what the other players choose.

Apr 08: Man, I just don't like this one as much as I used to.  I can see that there are multiple paths to victory, but much of the game feels "on rails" to me.  Notre Dame and Race for the Galaxy both seem to scratch the same itch with better implementations.

Need to refresh my memory about this game. Its role-selection of what essentially are phases in the game is still fairly unique even after a dozen years since release. How well it holds up as a "euro" compared to the huge selection of titles after is a question I've yet to know the answer to. The game might feel a little too 'basic' for me now, and the often-critiqued "player to the left of the newbie wins" scenario might be a thorn in my enjoyment of PR.

I've probably played this game too much - BSW and BGG may have served roles in lessening my enjoyment of this game. The "strategies" just seem way too scripted now. In fact I'm beginning to think now (late 2007) that this game is not aging well.

* Note *  -this game is very difficult to rate for me. When I first bought it I thought it was the best thing since sliced bread. But, as I have now played it hundreds of times (too many) and matured in the hobby and become more knowledgable on what other games are out there it's now way down the list. It is only considered for play to introduce new gamers who are ready for a step up. So - do I rate this the 9 or 10 that it was for the first 2 years that I owned it? Or, do I rate it the lower rating that it currently is?

When you become the governor you can decide the evolution of the game: play for you or against the others. All your actions influnce the actions of the others. All time you play, no dead time, only fun! The problem? The first time there are a lot of mechanism to learn ... :)
A tip:Don't forget to build warehouses and markets: they could be very useful! 
My preferred build is the University. It's a great satisfaction build a violet and place a colonists on for free :)

Puerto Rico is a typical city building, farming and delivery game. The game process is performed by variable job selection. Every choices made by players influences the game dynamically. The game is ever-changing and guarantees replayablility. From the historical point of view, Puerto Rico is very controversial. Puerto Rico can hardly be free from the criticism of the biased historical viewpoint. To sum up, Puerto Rico is wonderful in game, but controversial in history.

Ideal Players: 3-5

Description: A classic euro-game. Win by shipping goods and building your city.

Pro: Role-selection and special buildings provide incredible strategic depth. Many ways to win. Constant player interaction. Interesting enough to provide great replay value.

Con: Can be completely deterministic with experienced players. Theme pasted on neat mechanics.

A good resource game. There are alot of bits so do have baggies ready for the little brown circles can get misplaced easily.  The game will last 45 to 1hr if you have 5 people that know what they are doing.  There are few house rules that I have used all the jobs and make them cycle in and out play during the rounds. This makes it bit more challenging for you might not get the job you need every turn.

I have loved this game from the first time I played (Labor Day Weekend 2009 at CabinCon). It's such an elegant game that moves quickly because of the mechanism, and always keeps you engaged with both your plan and what others are doing. It also is the favorite game of my two major gaming partners--my 15 year old and recently turned 9 year old daughters. My 9 year old began playing this summer (2010) and has quickly closed the gap on the two of us.

The directions are (as with most Euro games), a bit dicey in the translation to English. Nevertheless, we watched a Boardgames with Scott episode to understand the game which really cleared things up.

One of the best board games I have played. Although it may seem very complicated at first, Puerto Rico becomes quite easy to play as you begin to get used to it. It is not always possible to decide beforehand which role to play and which buildings to buy, because your choices are affected by the interaction with the other players. On each turn, there are opportunities to improve your own position and often you can spoil the opposition's plans at the same time, which makes it great fun to play. Highly recommended!,

FINALLY,  I had this game shrinkwrapped for almost 2 years and I bit the bullet and learned it and played it.  It was just hubby and me and we had played San Juan before, so we had some familiarity with the concept.  Rulebook is great, cracks me up to read some rule questions in the Forum that are quite clear if you just read the rule book.  Overall, we both enjoyed the game, neither has developed a solid strategy yet, but I like that.  We aren't into many top 10 games, never did Tigris, GOA, Power Grid, EL Grande or those types of games, but might have to try now.  Want to try with more players, might make game seem better...I really do like it, but don't know if it has what it takes to be #1. Hmmm.

Like slipping into a warm bath, a lovely Eurogame that only misses out on a higher score due to dubious theming choices (brown 'colonists'? On plantations? REALLY?)

I think I prefer RFTG overall though, just for a more varied experience.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I still can't figure out why I like this game so much. There are really only two strategies:shipping or selling. Everything else is a slight tweak of one of these two. You're also often forced a certain direction by your first few plantations or building.

All that being said, role selection is incredibly tension filled. It's not about taking the action that is objectively best for you, it is about taking the action that is best for you relative to the other players. I also love setting up an action based upon how the Governor will be moved.

Best with 3-4

This one will remain one of my favourites. I think I like it even better than Agricola (after having played both games more than a dozen times). 
The only drawback seems that sometimes the play can feel a bit mechanic, but luckily everyone in my gaming group (myself included) pulls enough "weird" or unexpected moves to keep plays away from becoming "scripted". It keeps the game fresh, even after 30 plays (from Sept. '08 until May '09).

RATING: 9
I finally had the honour of playing this legendary game a bunch on BGA recently - and while I wanted to call the game bloated and outdated - I can't.

This is a wonderful game.  Having only played it online I feel I have gotten off easy with some of the games weaknesses as oh boy does it look fiddly and a time sink to set up and manage.  When played online however - the game takes about 10 minutes a player which is great.

Without having to worry about managing the components, the true beauty of the game really comes out.  Some buildings could probably use a couple of tweaks in balance and going 4th in a 4 player game is a slight handicap but that's about it.  There are multiple strategies to aim for, you have to always be ready to adapt to what other players are doing and you must always keep a -very- close eye on your opponents.  While high level Stone Age became a math contest very quickly on BGA - Puerto Rico looked better and better - with a brilliant mix of tactics, strategy and player interaction.

Hate to say it - but this one deserves the title of classic.

Seems an interesting game from first acquaintance, but it is only after a few plays that you really begin to appreciate its depth and variety. Considering the very limited element of chance, and lack of chrome, it really is amazing the game is different every time. Add to this the flexibility (equally good with 2-5 players), moderate playing time and relatively streamlined rules and you have an excellent example of a modern board game. Although I still feel that something is lacking in Puerto Rico, and that a better game could be designed, it will remain a 10 for me until that game comes along.

Very good economic game.  It just appeals to me every time I play it.
Maybe there are better, or more innovative/complex, mechanics out there, but this one has its irresistible charm...

EDIT: A word of warning: the replayability might be an issue after some time.  You follow more or less the same lanes every time.  Two expansions alleviate the problem, but I'm not sure about their staying power.  I'll give them enough opportunities to shine, that's for sure.

EDIT2:  Yeah, after almost 20 plays I have enough.  The expansions help, but only temporarily.  Patterns and strategies repeat themselves too much from game to game.  And the tactical element is not interesting enough to compensate for it.

Sold.

EDIT3: Ugh.  After precisely 20 plays I have no desire to play it ever again  The replayability is thoroughly exhausted (even with expansions).

Why I took so long to pick this up, damn! This still plays great as a 2 player, we're currently playing 2 boards each and using the lower score of the 2 to determine winner. Playing with the official Alea variant is very very good but be sure to use a 3/2 role selection so the same player can't go twice in a row. 

Strategies/tactics are very much based on timing and you need to adapt throughout the game depending on what else is happening. Very enthralling, much much better than San Juan IMO, I prefer the depth and don't mind 10 minutes of set-up time, I also prefer the longer more detailed game. The replay value is huge and I see a ton of games being played in the near future. I wish all rule books could be written this well with examples, I had but one question after reading. This could be the one that finally takes over DOA for me, I don't think so but we'll see...

[u]UPDATE:[/u] Before 3 more plays we realized that the University was no good and bought the expansion because it was so cheap. Glad we did, balances the building selection out great now with a few small changes overall that improves the game a fair amount. See my comments in expansion...  

[u]EXPANSION UPDATE:[/u] The new Puerto Rico expansion in Alea's treasure box was pretty nifty, some of it was quite good, some I think was too strong. Tweaking might be needed but overall I would like this as it adds one more solid path to take albeit maybe too strong as mentioned.

RATING: 7
I've played this about as much as I care to.  There's not much here left to explore and I'm not excited enough about it to try the expansion.  I've seen it before and played it a couple times online and I think I'm just tired of Puerto Rico.

Having said that, I still think it's an outstanding game.

I believed the hype and traded for a copy.

Dislike the game. Could be because I just don't "get" the games mechanics/best plays, suspect it may be because I have only played with VERY experienced players who totally cream me at the game!

And, of course, my errors/lack of ability hand the game on a platter to the player to my left - does not make me popular!

Strategic management game, a bit Catan-like, but more complex and without direct negotiations between players. Nice gameplay, especially due to factories which allow deviations from standard rules.

Not sure how as an almost entirely euro guy it took me this long (almost 250 other games first) to try this game. It's a solid game, and I can definitely see the Race for the Galaxy connection. It seems to be mostly a game about figuring out what actions your opponents will take and how to be most ready for that, and also a game about tempo. And I can see how it would be really weird with players of very different skill levels, moreso than most games. Certain buildings definitely seem stronger than others but I think that's okay since they're in a common offer. I don't think I have any particular complaint about the game other than it felt a little familiar, and that's certainly not the game's fault. But for whatever reason it just didn't much excite me. definitely a solid game and I'd like to try it again, I could see the rating going up.

I love this game, don't get me wrong, but the more I play it with "gamers" the more I'm soured on playing it with them. Games can tend to be overanalyzed which can suck the life right out it. It's a game though, not brain surgery, don't take this so seriously! Yes, the moves do sometimes seem scripted as the best choice is sometimes obvious but that depends on if you react correctly to what is thrown your way. Try the online version, it plays in under an hour or the Excel verison where you can play a solitaire game in 10 minutes. Anyway this is a great game which I'd happily give a 10 rating if only it wasn't taken so seriously by so many. After all, you're supposed to play the game, not let the game play you. So, as a game, in and of itself, I'd rate it a 10 but played with over-analyzers I have to give it a lowly 4.

Great. A worthy game for the innovative turn-sequence system alone - and there's more. The game also combines the "multiple paths to victory" as in Princes of Florence, and the "break normal game rules" aspect of some CCGs (or Cosmic Encounter, Ursuppe/Urland etc.) in the form of purple building functions. (And yes, the buildings can be very powerful.) And yet the balance between the various game elements (building costs etc.) seems to be just right, so that there is no single obvious winning strategy (at least it seems so) nor elements which become useless because they're too weak. A most excellent, finely-crafted game. Perhaps the best of 2002, my bet for DSP winner.

Like Agricola, the strength of this game is that even the weakest players feel a sense of accomplishment throughout the game, even if playing against a veteran. That really opens up the crowd I can play this with.

Some thoughts so far after limited plays:

1) You can not be able to load any resources on a ship during the captain phase if you are far down the turn order or if the ships are full of the goods you have etc, and of course and unshipped goods go back to the general supply if you don't have a warehouse(s)

2) When gathering resources there can be none left of the finite supply by the time it's your turn to collect them, especially if those resources are still sitting on a half full ship.

3) It's easy to get locked out of trading resources unless you buy the office tile, and even then still locked out due to turn order and/or how many goods are already on the trade ship

4) If several players go for shipping, whoever doesn't has an advantage, the same applies to trading. As part of these two strategies, if there is a clash of one type of good, that can leave other players unchallenged.

5) A player who makes a bad decision can give the next player an advantage.

The game is all about tactically choosing an action that benefits you while benefiting other players as little as possible AND/OR setting up future turns. 

The important thing to remember is that being denied the ability to ship any goods when someone else chooses to ship is part of the game. The same goes for any other form of denail that the role selection throws up. This makes the game a lot more negative to it's very core than other euros, however this denial is too much for me in 5player.

I gnerally don't go for tactical games or negative games, so this is one that i struggle to enjoy.

Edit: This game is much much better as a 3 player, the issues mentioned are much more managable (previous plays were 5 player!).

Puerto Rico is a classic game.  I always feel a craving to play again.  You accumulate plantations that provide crops to buy buildings that provide useful abilities.  The goal is to get the most points via shipping crops and building buildings.  There are multiple paths to victory.  Every turn you choose a role that provides you a bonus but every gets to benefit (like getting to buy a building but the builder gets an extra discount).  My understanding is that once you play enough times it starts becoming scripted but I'm far from that point.  This game has a lot of replay potential!

One of our first euros.   Play 2 player variant.  Very competitive games, always fun and requires thought.  A classic.  Giving it nine stars because I'm not sure I've seen the full potential of this game with 2 players.  On 8/14/16 reintroduced playing 2p variant.  3/2 Governor phase.  3 ships less one good, 3 trades, 2 offices, no construction hut, 5 quarries.  Excellent.  Tight games.

Starting to explore different playing strategies. I usually lose to my son, but a quarry building strategy seemed to catch him by surprise ca win for me.  Just a great game.

RATING: 6
Puerto Rico has a reputation as a classic, but it's just not a game enjoy that much.

The main reason is that it's a game that doesn't scale well across experience levels. I've only really enjoyed the game when I've played with people who have about the same familiarity with it as I have. Any other time I've played, I either destroy new players or get clobbered by veterans. This mostly has to do with the lack of variety in game setup - an element of randomness that most modern Euro games include.

I'm not going to get into the debate about whether or not the theme (namely the use of "colonists") is a serious problem with the game because the theme isn't anything worth defending to me (there are plenty of games about agriculture, so this theme isn't anything special). At the same time, it's not the reason I may choose not to join a game of Puerto Rico - if I don't, it's actually because a lack of variety that leads to predictable results.

It's an excellent game, but there are definitely times I don't want to play--it's so intense that the crowd needs to be into it, in my opinion. There are layers of nuance to the role selection that make for very interesting games. I feel some folks are a little too married to their style of play and don't like being put off it. I'm the Emanual Lasker of Puerto Rico--my game is all about messing up your game.

Look up Carthaginians re-do of the artwork. It's really nice and makes the game easier to teach. I built this out, so this game trades for more than normal. It's the original game PLUS the carthaginian redux (with expansion).

Great game !
Took a few plays to really appreciate it.
It was my first game with this little luck involved, and this much strategie.  Felt there was a "fun" element missing, element usualy linked with randomness (event card / dice, etc...).  This game brings a different kind of fun, trying different strategies, outguessing your opponents, and hopefully being the one ending in front at the end.

Different strategies possible
Good game lenth (2h and less)
Great player indirect-interaction

I have two primary problems with this game.  First, the well-documented "left of the newbie" problem is something I have a hard time forgiving.  I'm in a huge gaming group (CABS: average attendance over 100), so when I'm recruited into a game, it's with experienced players.  The first game I ever played, there was actually a rush to change seat positions when they found out I was a PR newbie (people were still in the process of finding seats).  My second problem is that I almost invariably make a major blunder during the game, which I recognize about 30 seconds after I make it.  The last time I played this game (in July 2006), I won, but only because my friends gave me a mulligan on my blunder.

The more I play this game, the more I realize that it is just dry.  Some players are out of the game early since every action gives the person ahead of them more points.  I am just not a huge fan.

A friend took a chance on purchasing this game after I suggested it might be a fun one to try. I'm glad he did - we've gotten a lot of play out of it. The online version allows play in time slots and places where the tabletop version would be impractical, but it's still satisfying to move all those little bits around when we can.

Just got this to the table for the first time in a long while... I'd nearly forgotten how fun this one is! After growing accustomed to Agricola and Power Grid (and even Settlers), this one has surprisingly little down time. The decisions are fairly straightforward while still containing a significant amount of depth, and since everyone gets to do something on each turn it rarely feels like you're waiting around. Great game!

As the months go by, I find myself not wanting to open this box again.  I think I was burned by the high expectations of this being the #1 game at the time.  I don't think it's awful - just that I don't want to play it.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (May 2010)

Puerto Rico is a good economic game, no doubt about that. Still I think it is overrated (at the time of writing this, it is number 2 in the ratings) as there are many games I would choose over this one.

I love the tactics (role selection) and strategies (buildings) the game offers, also it has little luck which makes it very attractive for me. 

On the bad side it isn´t fun to play with people of different skill level which lead to unintentional kingmaking and the theme is awful (I would have never played this for the theme, I´m glad I was introduced to it by a friend)

Current Rating: 7.0

Nowadays, I almost always resist my game group peers when they propose to play Puerto Rico. The game fails to excite me and I really don’t want to play it anymore. I´m sure I will play it again but, for now, I’m adjusting the rating so it matches my new feeling toward the game. In all truth, the game NEVER really catch my attention and almost never I had fun playing it.

Current rating: 5.5

The luster is wearing off.  Its mechanically a great game and well balanced but the fun is gone.  After 40-50 plays, its a good return on the investment and maybe if it sits there on the back of the shelf, I'll be more interested in a couple of years.

So far only played twice, only with two players. Seems ok although I don't yet see there's a lot of player interaction. I don't think this one will get a big plug from me, but I'll wait for more players before I rate it.

Five plays now, four of them 2P. It's grown on me quite a bit. I still prefer more direct interaction but as the missus says "yeah, it's pretty relaxed and reasonably interesting"

Tactics take center stage over strategy here, as the numerous different role choices and plantation/building/seat positioning configurations make no two games the same (though some may seem similar).  Spawned a new legion of efficiency engine games.

The first Euro that I was "exposed" to. OK, I probably exposed myself to it but that's beside the point. Used as a base for a class assignment which asked us to design a board game. Basically, I re-themed Puerto Rico. Had been looking for it ever since (2005), but didn't really know where to get it in the country at that time. Got it now and managed to play a number of games. It's quite a thinky game, with many ways to win (apparently). I seem to use the factory/building strategy most of the time, though. Like wine, this game gets better with time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.7
Excellent, excellent game. Make sure you know that the people you are about to introduce it to are ready for it, though. It's about 20-25 minutes to properly explain, and then 2.5-3 hours to play that first game. It's definitely worth it. I played it once with a 13-year old girl whose favorite game is Life. She played the mechanics just fine, but I'm sure she was missing the strategy of it all. It's at least playable by non-gamers, though.

Multiple paths to victory. I don't think role selection is always an obvious choice. Which building to build next is an important, though tough decision.

Second only to Magic: The Gathering, in my book.

I am not as impressed with Puerto Rico as I used to be.  I have a hard time executing strategies.  And, when I have executed a strategy, it has not had a very high "fun" payout.  The components are atrocious.  That all being said, there is no denying that the rules for the game are elegant and it is a good game.  Upon reflection, I am just not sure that it is a fun game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A classic game that still holds it's own today. The only reason it's not a 10 is because the person sitting to your right can make or break your game. If there's one significantly less experienced player at the table, the person next to them is likely to win. But if you're all roughly as good or as bad as each other it's a brilliant game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A great deal of fun but I've found that I have a lot less fun with inexperienced players involved. 

The game moves along at a decent pace when everyone has played before..otherwise it drags as everyone insists on reading every single building card even after having already read it three of four times. 

There are a great many strategys that can be used and many interesting and tough decisions to be made as you go. You also have to be clever and adapt your strategy at the drop of a hat when someone snags up that one building that was key to your strategy.

The game is not nearly as complex as it may appear , nor as dry. It has been a real favorite.

I&#039;ve played this game more than any other and still enjoy playing.  Playing it well seems to be a mix of science, art and gut feel.  You can get very good at this game but it is still hard to be confident of victory given the butterfly type effects that occur.  I have to give this game a 10 as I&#039;ve been wasting a lot of my time if it isn&#039;t a great game.

Looks to be even better than Princes of Florence.  Can we rate it an 11?

Update:  Has become the standard in the ever-more-popular tactic of variable roles/powers.

The only problem this game has is that an inexperienced player can make things much easier on the player to his left.

One of the games that should reside in every games collection (along with all of the other alea titles).

Even though I have a hard time winning this game, I will never turn down a chance to play. The fact that is scales so well for different numbers is a plus too.

There are three reasons why my rating is not higher:

1. There is NO direct player interaction. Sure, what you do will affect the other players in some way, but you cannot trade resources or money with others... why?  This would shorten the game considerably.

2. It seems to be too easy for two players to 'gang up' on a third and force a 'kingmaker' situation.  This is very common in three player games.

3. It is very prone to over analyzing, so the game length can reach 2 hours or more... a little long for most Euros.

The players are plantation owners in the days when ships had sails. By growing up to five different kind of crops – corn, indigo, sugar, tobacco, and coffee – they try to run their business more efficiently than their close competitors: growing crops and storing them efficiently, developing San Juan with useful buildings, deploying their colonists to best effect, selling crops at the right time, and, most importantly, shipping their goods back to Europe for maximum benefit.

RATING: 8
This is a well-made game.  There are a lot of rules, but just about all of them are very intuitive.  If you like economic games at all, this will be a hit.  It mixes near-determinism with an inability to compute the precise outcome too far ahead of time, because the decisions of other players change the game dramatically.  

One flaw is that it works poorly when one player doesn't really care that much and is just along for the ride.  Decisions they make substantially affect the other players, and a player not trying to act in their own rational self-interest messes up the balance.  Who they effect will not be random or averaged out in the end, but will depend heavily on the seating arrangement.

I kept this at a 9 instead of 10, for I am guessing that it will lose some of its luster over lots of plays. I have played it 6 or 7 times, and continue to love it, but I can see that the lack of randomness could decrease my enjoyment over time.

Edit: Downgrading this to an 8. No fault of the games, but other games I like even more mean that this is no longer an 'always want to play'. Evaluated in a vacuum, this still gets a high 9. Would not mind at all being stuck with P.R. on a desert island.

For such a highly-ranked game, shouldn't this have been more fun?  After several evenings of play, my group decided that this was bland.  We perservered, and it still wasn't fun.  That was enough torture, so we dropped it.  Playing this game just wasn't fun.


UPDATE-  I gave PR another try, years after I wrote these initial comments.  I've changed my mind about the game.  I think Race for the Galaxy, perhaps my favorite game, has caused me to re-evaluate PR.  I like the role selection, the privilleges, and the scarcity of the different building types.  Perhaps I've matured as a gamer, or I'm just more willing to deal with a eurogame now, but I'm looking forward to playing PR again soon.

Took alot of games for me to learn. However I found it worth it. You have alot of options in this game and the mechanics are superb. The only bad thing I can say about this game, is inexperienced players can change the outcome a great deal.

The PC version fills the void for solo-play.

Probably not the greatest game of all time, but worthy of the high praise it's received.  I generally dislike the concept of different powers for different game components, and PR takes that to the extreme with its various buildings, yet I still love this game.  The choose-your-role mechanism works beautifully, and the interactions between the buildings and the roles (and each other) are fun to explore and study.

The more I play, the more I enjoy this one.  Lots of interesting choices to make, and I never feel like I'm waiting for someone else to make their move.

While this was one of the first "Euros" that I played when I started seriously boardgaming a few years ago, I hadn't played it in some time.  
I had to lower my rating, as I was not quite as impressed by some of the aspects of the game that had been new and intriguing when I had not played many modern boardgames.
After playing Thurn & Taxis, I saw a much better use of roles (and one that didn't allow for the same crippling of people who went later in a turn), and had to lower PR's score.  After playing Endeavor, I can honestly say that I have no desire to play PR again, so PR's score went down again.

We need a "Hall of Fame" for landmark games like this whose time has passed.

RATING: 7.5
Plenty of interesting strategy in this one, it's easy to see why its #1 or #2 here, I wouldn't rank it quite so high on my personal list simply because I'm not too fond of the rules for the endgame. If you aren't playing with everyone on roughly the same strategic level it's easy to take advantage (or get screwed).

Until i buy several other games, this is just the table hitter. It always get played and really is everyone's favorite game. What's not to like.

So, jetzt hab ich es endlich auch mal gespielt und bin nicht entäuscht, allerdings kommt es für mich nicht an Caylus heran. Grundsätzlich ist es genau so gut, sicherlich, allerdings hat der Spielmechanismus eine kleine Schwäche, man ist als Spieler nicht gegen "Klüngelei" geschützt. Durch die Reihenfolge der Spieler bedingt kann man leider an "Zusammenspieler" geraten gegen die man nicht gewinnen kann :( wenn sie es clever anstellen! Wenn die Gegner geschickt am Tisch sitzen, dann ist man ausgeliefert. Dies ist bei Caylus nicht bzw. nur schwer möglich da die Spielerreihenfolge mit jeder Spielrunde wechselt. Aber trotzdem muss ich natürlich neun Sterne verteilen. Was sonst?

The mechanics are absolutely perfect, and original, too, at the time of publication. It's fascinating how slight differences in players' turns each round can lead to big differences over the length of the game. A masterpiece, without doubt.

I'm knocking it slightly due to the uneven value of some of the buildings. With experienced players some buildings never get purchased.

Tras unas cuantas partidas empecé a ver el valor real de este juego.

Tienes tu isla, donde puedes producir distintos tipos de productos. Para esto necesitarás materia prima (café, tabaco,...) en tu isla y, después de la cosecha, puedes transformarla en productos reales.

Si realmente quieres producir y transformar tus materias primas, necesitarás algunos edificios en tu tablero. Esto es muy importante, sin edificios no puedes producir barriles de materiales procesados.

Hay dos tipos de edificios: edificios de producción (blanco, azul, marrón, negro) y edificios violetas. Los edificios de producción están centrados en procesar materiales y los edificios violetas están enfocados a ayudar a los jugadores a ganar dinero o puntos.

Los edificios y las plantaciones necesitan gente para funcionar. Un edificio o una plantación vacía no funciona y su poder no se aplica. Cuando obtienes tus barriles los puedes cambiar por puntos o dinero.

La mecánica del juego es simple, un jugador elige un rol (acción) y cada jugador hace la misma acción. El jugador que eligió el rol además consigue un privilegio. En cada ronda todos los jugadores eligen un rol.

Mi opinión: éste es un juego muy bueno. La primera vez que jugué no lo entendí, y no lo consideré un juego que pudiera pertenecer al TOP10 de la BGG. Unas cuantas partidas después, empecé a ver su potencial, puedes hacer más de lo que piensas en la fase de selección de roles.

After a few plays I started to see the real value of this game.

You have your island where you can produce diferent kinds of products. For this you will need raw material (coffee, tobacco,...) in your island and, after you harvest it, you can turn it into real products.

If you really want to produce and transform your raw material, you will need some buildings on your board. This is very important, without buildings you can't produce barrels of processed materials.

There are two types of buildings: production buildings (white, blue, brown, black) and purple buildings. Production buildings are focussed on processing materials and purple buildings are focussed on helping the players to earn more money or points.

Buildings and plantations need people to work. An empty building or plantation is not working and its power can't be applied. When you get your barrels you can trade them for points or money.

The game mechanic is simple, one player take a role (action) and every player plays the same action. The player who took that role aditionally gets a privilege. Each round every player takes a role.

My opinion: this is a very good game. First time I played it I didn´t understand it, and I didn´t consider it a BGG TOP10 game. A few games after, I started to see its power, you can do more than you think in the role selection phase.[/color]

This, not Settlers or Ticket to Ride, was my first foray into modern gaming. I played it roughly 50x before finally getting burned out sometime late in 2006. While I have fond memories of my time with Puerto Rico I have no real desire to play it again.

WIFE RATING/Comments - 7
My very first euro.

UPDATE:

In recent years I have grown tired of economic snowball games, of the mechanical interaction and resource maximization that are hallmarks of them. Puerto Rico is the progenitor of these Euros and while I'd never call into question its design, I am no longer interested in it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
My #2 all-time favorite (Die Macher is still #1), PR is easily the best new game of the past five years and also the best game playable in under two hours.  The elegant role mechanism is its most unique design concept, meshing with the fact roles not selected in a turn become more attractive the next turn.  Each game, the player is faced with a series of tough decisions, the obvious ones being what role to select and what to build, but even smaller ones such as how to allocate colonists, what plantation to take, which goods to ship, which ship to use, which goods to keep and which goods to warehouse, all these can have a big effect later in the game.  Having an overall strategy is nice, but you need to be flexible and watch what your opponents are doing, too, as it is primarily tactics that decide the outcome among good players.  Knowing when in the midgame to convert from income generation to points generation is critical, as is the endgame (i.e. accurately predicting how the game is going to end and being prepared for it.)  The only random elements are player seating and the plantation draws, yet each game of Puerto Rico is different.  Andreas Seyfarth is a genius for creating this wonderful design, whose elegantly simple mechanics drive a deeply strategic and cerebral game.

Very nice game mechanism.  The role choice which allows all players the action is inspired, as is the increasing the value of the unselected roles.  Good scope for both strategic and tactical play without being too complicated.  Offers new ideas and variety on each playing.  Excellent theme.  Crucially, PR includes money as a commodity, which I regard as a design shortcoming - the truly great designs bypass the need for money - Settlers and San Juan are two of the best examples.  Verdict:  I would not rate it the very best game out there but I can see why many would - certainly in the top group of games.

I finally got a chance to try this one, after hearing about it for so long! This was so much fun. The kind of game that keeps you thinking about it for days afterward. The other players had a mix of experience levels, which made things fun: 2 newbies, 1 had only played once or twice, 1 expert optimizer, and 1 expert contrarian. 

Rating reduced by 1 to 7 due to incompatibility of new players playing with experienced players and how that affects the game.  If I was always guaranteed of playing others with the same experience as me, I'd rate it 8.

The classic role selection game.  It's imperative to make moves that advance your cause, while assisting your opponents the least.  Although this is not considered at two-player game, I find it fantastic at two.  It is also great at three.  I would not play it with more than three.

The draw back to Puerto Rico is the set up time.  Playing it on an iPad solves that dilemma, while cutting playing time in half.

RATING: 9
A marvel.

Puerto Rico strives for the ideal of non-random, no-luck play where the variability emerges almost entirely from players' actions. Each decision you make is a wave that other players are trying to catch. Each wave that comes your way is designed to flatten you. The game is smooth, fast, accessible, deep, complex, and variable, and it makes it all look easy. Few games can live up to it.
 
Rated a 10 a year and a half after first discovering it (12/24/08). 

[April 2010] Rating downgraded to a 9. Doesn't have quite the same breadth of options I look for in my absolute favorites, but that's about all I could say against it. Still great. 

[September 2010] Puerto Rico has been falling in my esteem lately, if only slightly. The thing is, after 40 plays I just don't see the kind of even viability (balance) across all the buildings. There are a full handful of buildings that don't seem to pull their weight, and though this may vary situationally, it seems generally true. The Large Market, Office, University, and Large Warehouse all seem like sucker plays too much of the time. The Hospice is borderline. I love the overall design of the game but the building set just doesn't seem to allow players the freedom of approach that it promises. This has sent Puerto Rico from a top 5 position to the back end of my top 20. A great game, but perhaps with an Achilles Heal.

Have played 3-player face-to-face - fun game, bit of a brain burner, and it seemed to go *fast*, i.e. all players thought 'what it's over already?' when it became apparent the endgame was nigh (either a player built all buildings, or the 55 colonists ran out ...)

It's an extremely cleverly designed game, and many aspects of it (though it is not the first) will be classic economic boardgame fare for years to come: e.g. variable phase order through player roles, conversion of money into VP, multiple paths to victory, etc.

Brain-burning game with no luck and no variation in the start conditions, which may harm replayability for me.  However, I enjoy playing it immensely and despite the simple mechanics I found it very engaging, even as a two-player.  My only criticism is the quality of the components; the cardboard chits and boards are flimsy.  I would expect better from a quality Euro, especially in the light of other Rio Grande publications (like Caylus) which are far higher in quality.

I managed to get in on the sneak preview at Essen, and I wasn't terribly impressed although everyone else seemed to be.  Since then, i've played it many times with many different folks, and while it feels great in the early and middle bits, I think that the decisions are obvious in the end game, and it feels fairly mechanical at that point.  And too much of the game flow is determined by others mistakes during the game.  Overrated, but i'm upping my rating from a 6 to 7, based on the fact that it's still fun to play with a good group given the nice interaction.

Classic.  Everyone should play this game at least three times.  It doesn't feel it's age (like go and chess).
Once I got a handle on the buildings I really started to enjoy this game.  Many different strategies and great interaction with other players.  Rules are not complex, but the strategies can take a few plays to get the hang off.  Therefore I wouldn't play this with non gamers are a first game.
Our version was for 3-5 players, but found a good 2 player variant.  Not as good as with 2-5, but a great way experiments.
This is in my top ten games.  An all time classic.

1. I'm very sorry, but I can't get rid of a spreadsheet-feeling when I put this game on the table. Like I'm an accountant fumbling with counters on an abstract frame. It feels constructed to me, and even as the construction works, that is not what I'm looking for when playing a game.

2. It took me 4 games, but now the game has conquered my heart! I am a big fan now, and do not agree with my 1. comment anymore! I think the 1. has happened to more players.. ;)

Not game #1 for me but being #1 on the Geek 8 years after its release certainly is enough proof of lasting goodness. The unique point is that even after this long time there are no big numbers of me-too-products like El Grande or Caylus have produced. The role selection and tight gameplay still feel fresh and good play needs concentration on various dimensions like strategic planning, efficient engine building, timing of roles and control of the game end.
Compared to today's (2010) eurogames it shines in its comparably streamlined rules creating a fluent gameplay without much downtime. Agricola is fiddly as hell in comparison. Too much love for chrome and aimless complexity today. Troyes anybody? That being said, Puerto Rico is a design that I respect rather than admire.

RATING: 9
This is one of those games that get better the more times you play with the same people.  There is very little luck, but more outmaneuvering other players.  You have to understand what other players are going for, and what you can do to counter it.  Sometime you have to decide between doing what helps yourself the most, and what helps other people the least.  The depth of strategy is very satisfying, and the fact that many people claim there's an *unbeatable* strategy (each different from the other)  there's an oppurtunity to try out different things each game.

UPDATE- I got to play this last night, i kind of liked it.  I won! I had no plan, it was just a matter of doing what made sense each turn. It felt like I was just riding a wave surfing, I was in a sweet spot the whole time. It was not a slaughter, but I had 25pts, followed by 22, 22, and 18.
I did really like that I went second though. I benefitted from player 1, and was set up to benefit from 3 and 4's moves.

Awesome game that involves maintaining a settlement on Puerto Rico. You and others will compete for resources, colonists, plantations, goods and other things in your question to build the best settlement. The turn mechanic is simply brilliant and extremely intuitive. The player whose turn it is will select a role they wish to take. Every player will take that role, but the person whose turn it is will get a bonus. Extremely interesting game, with little to no luck involved. Takes 2-3 hours, but is very fun.

RATING: 3
The absolutely darling of my game group, which is why I don&#039;t end up going to the gaming sessions as much as I should. It gets a 3 only because it represents my introduction into German board games. Otherwise, we are talking about another major yawner of a game. To its credit, it has excellent player interaction and strategy, but once again the theme is an absolute joke. Who wants to play a game that takes more mental preparation than taking a written examination? It&#039;s plain from their board games that the Germans eschew violence - so why don&#039;t they do something right up their alley, and produce tastefully erotic sex themed games rather than snoozers like Puerto Rico? Guys, gaming is supposed to be fun, not a nerdfest or braniac convention.

It took awhile to finally catch on.  But we play this as 2-players.  It is so good.

It's in good condition and all the tokens and bits are there. The shelf wear on the box is only noticeable if you are really looking for it. Some of the player boards also have some slight wear on the very edges. Both the shelf and board wear are the kinds of wear that a normal person wouldn't notice and would think we are being nit picky to even mention, but a gamer/collector would feel like I was leaving something of eternal importance out by not mentioning it.

In a word: perfect. No other game I've played seems to get it all this right. Hidden victory points keep everyone enthralled right to the last turn. Every time.

The chaos of 5 players is the only mark against it.

What is there left to be said?  Undoubtedly a great game that I haven't yet burned out on.  I can see how a clinical, chess-like approach would be a turn off.  Luckily I always play with my family, and we're all at about the same level.  At times I find myself getting stuck in a rut of always buying the same buildings, but no game is ever the same, which will definitely give the game quite a bit of longevity.

My initial review of this game was horrible. I still think [b]it's a rulebook game[/b]: if you don't have a few plays under your belt or you're an excellent listener with a fantastic teacher, you don't stand a chance and end up producing nothing. 

On the other hand, after understanding the system this game is [b]purely brilliant[/b]. I can see why it was #1 for the longest time. Though it may look as everyone starts relatively equally, the positioning of each player effects their role completely. No special rules for each player, just positioning. That's amazing in itself. The mechanic of having mostly everyone participate in a player's turn is marvelous. It's been done in Twilight Imperium 3, but Puerto Rico's method is [b]far more simple and engaging[/b].

The [b]strategy is compellingly deep yet simple enough - actually quite similar to chess.[/b] There are multiple ways to win and most of the time, you are doing your best to isolate the market instead of directly screwing over someone else. This makes it [b]generally a more friendly game[/b] compared to some of it's rivals (like Caylus where moving the Provost can really hurt other players).

RATING: 9
A game where the dynamics change so rapidly, both on a tactical level from role choice to role choice, and on a strategic level from the early rounds and on up to the endgame.  PR requires a lot of analysis and it can be easy to miss something or to get stuck on accomplishing some minor feat that one misses the big picture.  Because of this and the fact that poor plays can swing things for everyone else, it can seem intimidating to play against self- proclaimed "experts".  But the loud ones are usually not quite as expert as they think they are.

Was good until I realized there is a strict strategy you have to follow in the opening sequence or else you're pretty much going to lose. Seems to be best played by a group of equal experience levels. Whoever sits next to the newbie usually gets the advantage.
In the beginning, cash is king, prioritize it over everything else.
Buy the harbour.
Don't manufacture the same good as the player ahead of you in turn order, but do try to manufacture the same good as the player after you in turn order.

I really am in awe of the design of this game and think it was way ahead of its time in 2002 although it doesnt have a dated "vanilla" feel that games like Catan and Carcassone seem to have despite being really popular when they were released. I feel this game could have been released this year and still be in the top 10.

Yes, I am certainly trendy - rating BGG's top game at a 10, but I absolutely feel this is worth it.  While this isn't the game that I would break out at every get together, the sheer genius behind the mechanics give me a good brain-burn unlike any other game I've played before.

Great game! I love how you have to pay very close attention to your opponents and set yourself up to take advantage of the actions they are going to take. It's a little hard to grasp from just reading the rules, but once you play the machanics are pretty simple, but to play well is a challenge.

It's not a 10 because its just so darn ugly :(

This is a completely great game for 2 to 5 players and I have no issues with the theme. Every decision really counts and there's a constant feeling of positive pressure. It's a pleasure to play every time and it's always worth it. As added positives it plays usually in an hour and there's no downtime.

I love tactical games and this one is perhaps the greatest. While this and Caylus have almost reached gaming perfection this one's weakness is that inexperienced players are often unintentional kingmakers. I will only rate a game a ten when I absolutely love it (a criterion that PR meets) and I can not find a major weakness.

In many great Euros, the key to success is "do what others aren't doing". In Puerto Rico, however, you have to time your actions such that you don't lose too many actions on other players' turns, but also that they lose efficiency during your turn. This game of denial is why this game is still heralded 15 years later.

Played once and my experience was not a good one.  I found the theme and gameplay boring.  I really didn't care if I chose to plant more grain or buy a warehouse.  There are few mechanics that I don't like in games but I don't enjoy the mechanic of picking a role/choosing an action and then having everyone benefit from it (also found in Eminent Domain).  This game also felt like the game was fairly unforgiving; those who fell behind early had no chance to catch up.  I'd play this again and certainly I would be interested to see the components improvement in the anniversary addition but it certainly isn't anywhere near the top of my playlist.

A fantastic game, one with apparently endless replay value.  One concern is that there is a strong "player order" effect, so the game really works best with all players of the same skill level; a poor player can destabilize the game.  For all of its components, the game is surprisingly simple and accessible; can be pretty much internalized by the end of the first turn.  One of the best I've ever played.

Oh what fun, a spreadsheet in board game format.  What's even better is that it's a board game the totally exploits plantations and slave labor, you just gotta love that!  It's amazing all the 10s this game has received. Those raters must have such dull lives that this boring mess excites them and that they find it acceptable to turn a blind eye to such acts as slavery, or maybe they just find it acceptable...

A good game that taught me there were other board games apart from risk, cluedo and monopoly.

The role mechanic is superb, the minimalistic game pieces offer a very good overview of the game state, while the color and artwork gives just enough excitement for the eye.

In addition, this is a great gateway game and I've gotten about twenty people so far interested in board games with this game.

This game is so scripted. Just get {insert a bunch of the most expensive buildings} and you can't lose. Also, we should not stoop to playing games that reflect a time of slavery. We should be out there [i]razing entire star systems[/i] for great justice.

Suggested rules adjustments: Large Warehouse costs 5, University costs 7, Factory costs 8, a player who starts with corn starts with 1 doubloon less.

 Time may have eroded some of it's luster, but it still deserves credit for paving the way and being a great game and mechanic in its own right.
The only subtraction is the fact that all players must be of somewhat equal competence. And--- On some turns, it is OBVIOUS what you must do...you "must" do...or the others will tar and feather you. This is the sole reason it is no longer a "10" for me, and has fallen...still pretty damned good, though! :)
It also tends to play best with the full 5...another small nick in it's greatness.

Pretty good action selection game. I like the building aspect so tend to focus on that. Rules aren't complex but there are lots of small, finnicky section tht are easy to overlook.
Game has one big problem though: the players. If you play it with experienced players it'll probably be a better game but the strategies for PR are kinda set in tone by now. Yet playing with others, like me, who don't know (or don't want to know said strategies) and the game kinda drags on. Especially due to people making just... weird... moves.

There's been so much written about the elegance and depth in Puerto Rico, but after 10+ plays I think what I like best about it is the lack of downtime.  The role selection mechanism keeps everyone involved throughout, and it both plays more quickly and FEELS like it plays more quickly than other games of similar depth/complexity.

So, why do I rate the #1 game a lowly 3... because I only enjoyed the game the first time I played it.  Since then it is too regimented, not a game, but point and counterpoint moves.  Even when you're not playing with PR masters you get the feel of why the game has developed into that mode of play.

A fantastic strategy game.  However it is very complex rules wise making it difficult to explain to newer players, and newbies playing with veterans makes for a very bad game since actions are so interdependent and newbies can give other players the win without realizing they're doing so.  Also the game takes a long time.

I love the mechanics though and different building strategies.  I have recently purchased the expansion buildings and I look forward to trying those out sometime.

For the fun:time ratio, I'll always choose San Juan over this. San Juan offers far more dynamic play whereas Puerto Rico seems to be more predictable—every game the same. But I do still enjoy playing.

Edit: After having played again years later, the reasons I've been avoiding pulling Puerto Rico off the shelf have become clearer. 

Everything you do in Puerto Rico needs some extra component to activate it. Just bought a sugar field? Want to produce some sugar? Too bad! You have to wait several more turns to set things up just right so that this simple outcome can be achieved.

Compounding this is the loss of goods when another player decides to ship. You put hard work and many turns into getting a field, building a factory to match, populating both with colonists, and finally producing something... only to have the final product evaporate. It's very demotivating. And how the hell does my [i]inorganic[/i] supply of indigo go bad because a guy down the street decides to ship some barrels of corn, anyway?

For the whole game, you just feel roadblocked and pinched in a way that doesn't make for a fun time.

Try [thing=8217][/thing]. It's got phases and similar artwork, but the feeling you get from playing is completely different.

I was impressed with this one.  Not a pretty game, and it looked terribly dry, so I wasn't itching to try it, despite it being a classic for 15 years now; I tended to avoid it.  (I'm quite picky about Euros.)  I was also warned that slaves are used as a commodity, and that was a turn-off before even playing it.  In the end, I got roped into a game of this and had quite a good time with this one.  Didn't expect that!  :-)  The whole using slaves part of the game feels pretty icky, though... and I would have rated it higher if it didn't have that.

RATING: 7
The game itself is a 7 but I'd rate it a 3 because of its players. Puerto Rico is entertainment and there are not enough "casual" PR players. PR simply isn't strong enough to carry the burden so called "serious" players want it to carry. Recrimination starts immediately and is continuous. PR, though a good game, breaks under this intensity. When victory is the piece de resistance, you have to look to real life endeavors as few games can suffice. Those that do are probably two player and abstract games with brilliant handicapping systems or between peers.

This was the first "gamer" game that I owned. It's a great game that really excited the euro game type.

Puerto Rico can be a little rough for very new gamers as it's possible for a poor play to benefit the following player. Familiarization with the various buildings also gives an advantage to experienced players, though that's common in many games.

Although I don't play this enough to own it anymore, it's still a great game that I'd be happy to play.

Update April 2014.  I haven't played this in a while and I think it would be tough to play again due to having to relearn how to play well.  Good game, but too difficult to play well with people who don't play it frequently.

Updated September 2008 after a few more plays.  This game is great once you get over the learning curve.  Each action is important, and you must develop the ability to see how your actions will impact the other players.  Once you do that, the game opens up and you can see why it's one of the top board games.

Easy rules, tough strategy.  Great multi-player game.  It can be frustrating though if you're the least experienced player in a game where everyone else is very experienced.  There's a tough learning curve for the strategies and in determining how you're moves will impact the other players.

A really great game, deserving of its spot of honor at the top of the BGG rankings along with Agricola and the others.  The design is obviously genius, with so many elements blended so perfectly with the simplicity of role selection.  You have to use your privileges gained from role selection very wisely to get ahead in this game.  Also, the violet buildings can be game breakers and are difficult for newbies to fully grasp the first time around.

I've played this a lot, both online and face to face.  Great fun every time.  Destined to remain a classic.  The only drawback is the difficulty that new players have against experienced players -- and how decisions of new players can affect the outcome of the game.  I don't take it that seriously, though...

Was a 9 on first play, then a 6, and a 5 thereafter.  San Juan offers as much fun in a fraction of the time and bother.  The expansion helps a little.

Lives up to the hype.
Though the player interaction wasn't direct, the role choice they made indirectly and immediately affect you.

So many routes to victory, and luck factor kept to a low.  Buildings can become scarce quickly, so weighing options on buying early or increasing capcity creates high tension.  As crops get planted, do you want to grow what your opponent has, making it harder to sell at market, but perhaps more likely to ship when needed?  Do you adjust by buying a building that lets you sell the additional resource at market or buy warehouses that lets you stock the goods up, buying you time to strike when opportunity arises?

Should I grow the free crop and ship them away for victory points, or grow the expensive crops and make some $$$ and buy buildings?

Oh no, I've built too many crops and buildings and don't have people to man them...should I take the mayor role to get more people, or take the role that has a ton of bribes on it?  What would the trade-off be...can't decide, can't decide; brain aneurism!

Wow this game blows my mind.

I've seen complaints that the gameplay dilutes down to the same strategy after repeated play...I'll see.  My only real complaint for now is the setup.

When played as a resource management game this is one of my favourites (and scored accordingly).  However, it's possible to meet players who take great glee in using limitations in the rules to deliberately target and screw up another player's game, at which point I get really disappointed with it (and them).

A finely balanced innovative game.  I've enjoyed it with 3 - 5 players, and will never turn down a game.  I continue to enjoy this game years after its release, and after the initial frenzy has passed.  A truely great game.

Rock solid mechanics, though they feel a bit dated by today's standards. Ugly components, but again chalk that up to the age of the game - there simply was no standard for art and graphic design at the time. Starts off a bit slow, and goes maybe a turn longer than it needs to, but a good game, and still very playable in 2016.

"The 3 player game isn't nearly as fun, but with 4 or 5 this game has it all."I'd disagree...I think it works fantastically well with 3-4 but doesnt work very well at all with 5.  Its one of the games i've played most frequently, and it IS a spectacularly well put together game.  Theres hardly a fault to it.  Also the board and pieces are clear, look good, and just work.  Its definately my number one game.

The current king of the hill.

UPDATE: The king has been deposed. Not all things are meant to last. Probably one of my three most played games ever, so I expect it to be burnout, really.

Maybe its the poor presentation or maybe I'd just played this one enough but I'd grown to actually prefer Cuba and other similar games over this one.

Acquired 2002. Total number of plays > 40. I've enjoyed all my games of Puerto Rico; there's a variety of different options/strategies. I think the game mechanism melds together very well, and I like how everyone is involved in the game all the time. I think it sees less table time because it takes a while to set up the game, and a while to teach it to newcomers.

It's a brilliant design that suffers from one rather minor flaw (factory and university should have switched costs), but otherwise it deserves a high place. Yet I traded it away. Why? Because 

a) Too many fiddly bits, especially the colonists
b) Requires a lot of thought-power to invest in the game
c) Not easy to teach to impatient people wanting to start the game already.

It was never going to get played. So trade list it went.

I wish I rate this game as 11 or higher if I could. This is the best worker placement game. One player choosing everyone doing the same action is just mind blowing mechanic. The depth of economical and strategic decision making process is tremendous within this game too. I have the anniversary edition with gold coins and that makes the game even more immersive. I have introduced this game to new gamers many times and quite often I see they order a copy immediately after the game ends. That is how existing and fun this game is.

It was the second Euro game (after Carcassonne) I tried and it blew my mind and is largely a reason why I started to get interested in board games.

The only thing preventing a 10 rating is that turn order becomes very critical if not all the players are of equal skill level and that some buildings should be cost adjusted a bit for better balance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a great game.
I love the skill involved and the various stategies and the weighing up what other players tactics are and how to react to them.
It's a nice short game - about 90 minutes and it keeps all players fully involved throughout. (There's none of this being knocked out)
Another great thing is you are always doing something - not sat arounmd waiting for your turn - it is always your turn and you are always deciding what is the best thiung to do compared to other players.
The game is very different but equally good with 3 , 4 ot 5 players.
My only criticism is I expect that the game will tire after a number of plays with players having their own view on the best strategy and with no chance elements involved the game will become repetitive - but then loads of games are like that.
Highly recommend.

First played with Pat and Becca at their Christmas party '06

Played once with a math wiz, obviously didn't win, didn't like how hard it was to "catch up" in this game and how important the first few programmed moves were...disappointing for the top game on BGG

I liked this better the second time I played at Flatcon '07, it had a different flavor to it, and I actually did semi-well.

Quality rating: 9
Willingness to play rating: 6
Fun rating: 5

The biggest difference yet between quality and fun. This game is well made and has lots of elements, but doesn't play out as smoothly as it should.

I love that everyone gets an action no matter who the governor is. It's a little annoying that the game has been so analyzed and I have so little willpower that I have read and re-read strategy guides to this without much opportunity to play, rather than discovering myself through trial and error what does and doesn't work. The CURL online game is a good environment for practicing against AI opponents. My main weakness is that I am not flexible in my strategies, and once the one I have chosen looks thwarted, I drift aimlessly through the rest of the game, not being skilled enough yet to change direction or to accurately anticipate opponents' decisions.

this is one of the best role selection games for me (right behind TI3)

RATING: 6
An enjoyable, if not spectacular game, that was innovative at the time of its original release (2002) but has lost much of its luster (at least for me). The role selection aspect has now been copied many times – sometimes with better results – but the game mechanics rely in large part on everyone making the right decisions at the right time. Although kingmaking potential is present in many games, it can often be the unintentional result of another players bad decision which could quickly destroy your best laid plans.

Great game! I find that it scales well and is a blast to play.  Just sucks that one of my best friends doesn't like it. He says that when we first told him about the game we "built it up" too much for him. So when he finally played the game, he said it felt like a let down. Oh well.

Excellent game and one of my all time favorites!  Quality bits and artwork.  Plays best with 4, imo.  It is a bit of a stretch for non-gamers, but possible if they are bright, genuinely committed to learning it, and ok with the fact they're only going to score 12 points on their first go.  Endgame suffers only minimal analysis paralysis and scores are almost always close among experienced players.  This was my first "next level" game after Settlers and it will always be in my main rotation.  If you're a fan of German-style board games at all and you don't own PR, stop reading, go to your local shop, buy it, add friends and enjoy.

Tense, cutthroat, interactive build-your-engine. Brilliant game with an intelligent, economic design. 

This is euro gaming at its best but hardly a multiplayer solitaire experience. You need to be on your toes or you get hosed by the other players. At the same time, you can follow a strategy and have the satisfying engine building feel. Brilliantly balanced. A classic.

RATING: 8
Puerto Rico is a very solid game with lots of breadth complexity as well as tons of indirect interaction in between players. While not without flaws, it's both balanced and deep.

Lots of people complain about the seating order problems, and not without reason: its the game's greatest flaw, by a long shot. There is a super strong right/left binding, which in turn also makes certain interactions mechanical ("do that or X, who is seated to your left, wins").

The game is also based on snowball economies: all players are effectively competing to create the most efficient plantation. Thankfully, there are multitude of ways of affecting your opponent's plans, which makes the game engaging, deep and fun.

The game would have been a solid 10 for me if not for the seating order problems: I usually don't mind kingmaking, but for it to not be an issue most players need to be able to affect the situation in one way or another. In Puerto Rico you can find yourself seating at the other side of the table, powerless to do anything, while someone gives the game away.

Yet even despite this, it's an 8: the rest of the structure is extremely solid and deep.

Optimal number of players:

In some forum post about some other game, I saw someone describe PR thusly, "about as exciting as watching paint dry." That might be giving it too much credit. For me (and apparently, save for one, my whole gaming group*) there is no intellectual, emotional, or competitive payoff. I am willing to say I just don't get the fascination. I don't question whether the people who love it have good taste in games, but I have trouble understanding how it could be considered a top 5 game, and carry a rating of 8+. That just seems excessive.

+ The game requires meaningful decisions to win the game. 
+ There is the right amount of decisions to make.

[size=12][b]Fixable dislikes in regards to Puerto Rico:[/b][/size] 
/ The game seems to have bad replayability. There seems to be no variance in set-up. I would like the game more if some buildings were cycled with the active buildings. Fortunately some of the expansions for the game seem to address this problem.

[size=12][b]Why I dislike Puerto Rico:[/b][/size] 
- I dislike the slave theme
- I ought to try San Juan / Race for the Galaxy before rating this game higher or keeping the rating the same.

Medium to light Euro style game with lots of strategy and low level of luck, 2 player variant kinda works but the game really shines with 3/4 players. Worthy of the status it has obtained. Update: After more plays the game feels scripted, everyone has a preset plan they believe in and try to do the same thing and buy the same buildings every time. Might be improved with the buildings expansion.

After not playing this game in favor of San Juan for near a year, I surprisingly found how much I really enjoyed it.  
The set-up time is what mostly bothered me.  But I realized during this game that set-up for this game is probably just as long or shorter than Catan, without the frustration of the pieces not fitting nicely together.  So I'm upping my rating to 8.8.

I confess.  I absolutely cannot stand playing this bloody thing, and so I've continued dropping my rating following repeated plays.  It is not the theme (I enjoy Goa, Cuba, and other such colonizing/spice trading games).  It is not the role selection mechanic (I enjoy Citadels, San Juan, Cuba, and Race for the Galaxy, which also have role selection).  It is not the fact that it is a resource management game (most, or at least, many Euros have an RM component).  It basically boils down to two things -- do I ever want to play again?  No.  Could I be talked into it?  Maybe *once* more, before declaring that it is a 2, once and for all.  (EDIT: I have done so).

The main thing for me is that you *have* to play with other newbies your first game, or it breaks -- playing with a mixed group in this game, because of the left-right binding issues and how much (over)analysis has been done on it ensures that veterans will argue the whole game over who is being benefited by the newbie, and trying to coerce the newbie into taking moves favorable to them.  Also, a game in which you must know what all the buildings do in advance to *enjoy* the game is irritating...

Rules seemed overwhelming but I finally got my first game in. One of my friends liked it more than Power grid. this is definately a good game but I'm not sure i will like it as much as PG. 
After having played this game just once I'm sure i can explain it to others. as for strategies I'm not to certain. I won big because I had bought big buildings and . i had three "steengroeven"; the other players focussed too much on shipping their goods. I'm not too certain if this strategie will work again. i would say the replay factor of this game is very high because of the different ways to get VP.

Elegant, clever, challenging, fun, spans age and personal backgrounds... Everything I look for in a game. It's amazing the number of diverse people I'm able to introduce this game to. I'm also amazed at how much I can play in a row without burnout. I'm still not sure if it's completely balanced (the harbor and wharf are ALMOST a game breaker) but yet overcoming these seemingly unbalanced features became a game unto itself. When everyone is aware of the same 'unbalances' it balances back out.

I know that you are supposed to love this game but to be honest it is one I prefer not to play. I simply think it is quite boring and not at all interesting.

The game does not have any particular flaws, it is just not a good game. If I should try to pinpoint where it fails, however, there are two points I would like to make:

1.	There are too little surprises
   - There is almost no interaction between the players.
   - There is almost no random element.

2.	It is messy and overworked.
   - Too many roles (I guess the designer didn%u2019t want to limit the number of players).
   - Too many different tasks (shipping, immigrants, trading etc) as a result of there being too many roles.
   - Too many different buildings.

I get the impresion that the game designer wanted to make a strategy game and thus left dice and cards out. That would have worked if this were a game where the players interact more with each other. When you remove both interaction and randomness it starts to get predictable and simply boring.

Maybe this was the reason for the game being overworked. They had to add some complexity to prevent each game from being played in the same way.

Of course it's good and I like playing it, but it doesn't make such an impression after first knowing Caylus and Agricola. All those games share the same level of gaming experience for me, but there are those little things that make the difference like theme, quality etc. That depends on personal feelings and makes the game 8 or 9. Just like that. Great game anyway.

The return of Puerto Rico to BSW prompted me to revisit this game after a couple of years of not playing.  I noticed some things that made me decide to drop my rating.

I realized that more often than I would like, near the end of the game, the system forces a player into a kingmaker position.  This is unacceptable in a modern game.  It is possible that no matter how you've played up to that point, you will win or lose based on this person's whim or his personal kingmaker philosophy.  They may not even be aware of these consequences, but they are no less given the power to determine the game outcome.

The other games, however, can be fun puzzles of trying to optimize your moves and predict other players' actions.  If only you knew what type of game it was going to be when you sat down to play.  At least it only takes 15-20 minutes on BSW.

Had this for a long time, and it's never let me down. The mechanics are great, strategy is key, and the luck factor is almost non-existent. Nearly all my friends enjoy this game because it's easy to play and the winner is the person who played best, not who was luckiest.

The only real downsides are that without the expansion(s), the same buildings are available every game, which sometimes leads to experienced players adopting an identical strategy every game. Also, the University and the Large Warehouse are often considered to be too expensive to be worth buying.

The fact that you can see (and soon buy) all the buildings from the beginning is both good and bad. It makes it possible to plan a long term strategy but it also makes it harder for beginners and causes some AP. I still don't know how to win. Overall, it's a solid eurogame, but not the most fun IMO because you have many tight restrictions on what you can trade and ship. A lot of the buildings you can buy are just there to get rid of these restrictions. I prefer a bit more freedom.
I didn't actually like Puerto Rico the first time I played but second time was more enjoyable.

Certainly a great game, but the lack of any random elements leads to a "scripted" feel.  I'm a little shocked that some people play this game 100's of times.  I don't think it will have that kind of replayability for me.

I'm not a fan of "multiplayer-solitaire" games. I hated St. Petersburg, but fortunately Puerto Rico is little bit better - still there should be more direct interactions between players. Now all you need to do is to focus this "common pool" (=What role should I choose? If I choose this it means that I get this, but then the next player might do that... etc.) and all the rest is to build your own game in your own board. 

If there are 4-5 players the game takes too much time, with three fast players this is an okay game. Definitely a game, which is better when played via computer, because the game is faster.

RATING: N/A
In Puerto Rico players assume the roles of colonial governors on the island of Puerto Rico. The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.

Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.

The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.

[2007.Jun.11] I wondered for a long time what all the fuss was about over this game. No game can be that good... can it? Finally, I got a chance to play it, and after only one game, I was hooked (but I've played it many times since). I am thrilled with depth of the game—there is no single way to win the game. Additionally, there is a wonderful subtly in attempting to select the most appropriate role when it is your turn to do so. This is not a light game by any means, but it is also not the heaviest game out there. If I could make one suggestion to a anyone interested in trying Puerto Rico for the first time, it would be: Play the San Juan card game first! I did, and understanding the concept of choosing different roles as well as tracking how each building affects your own game was invaluable. Learning Puerto Rico, after having played San Juan, was extremely easy. Once you learn it, you will be sure to love it; everyone that I know does. If you have not already done so, add it to your own game collection. I'll see you on the island of Puerto Rico, just please don't ship my coffee.

The archetype of the limited player interaction, each building his own board type of game.  With roles ala Citadels, you get smooth play, nice strategy and friendly fun everytime.  Probably the most well rounded, best put together game around.  On the downside, there is somewhat of a learning curve and playing with experienced players can turn off new players.  A bad player sitting next to you can also tip the balance one way or another, depending on side.  Over the years, this has decreased in appeal to me because lots of great new game don't have the same "flaws".

This is the rating after first play. Puerto Rico is a fairly complex game and it takes some time to get into it and to gain an overview over all the strategic options it provides. With the different roles you can choose from there are so many options that it isn't easy to figure out what represents an optimal strategy for the current situation.
I give it a 7.5, though I might uprate it with further plays.

The granddaddy of the action selection where I choose an action and get a better version of that action than you do. 
It is said that Pro PRico players will always win and where you end up depends on where you sit, but it's fine if you're happy to play infrequently with gaming casuals who play for fun. 
Could maybe do with a bit more variety of buildings to freshen the game up once in a while, but it's a very solid 7, even after all these years.

Clever-clever design that opened my eyes to the possibilities of euro games when I first played it years ago.  I like the flow of the game and the indirect ways you can harsh your opponent's mellow, forcing him to discard resources or make sub-obtimal builds.

However, to me there isn't enough to keep the game from getting repetitive on repeated plays, so it's not something I would want to play that often.

Too, there are some parts of the game that I find dull and procedural -- for instance, having to wait for colonists to man your fields and buildings.  I'd be very interested in looking at "San Juan", which seems to streamline the game and keep most of the things I like about Puerto Rico while losing some things I don't.  (Update:  played "San Juan", liked that one even less.)

This game is amazing. Plays really well with 3 players, I have heard not as well with 5 players as it has a left-right issue that is mostly mitigated if there are three in a tight circle (it helps if everyone is at the same or similar skill level).  The strategy really evolves as you play it more often.  Mega-replay-ability here.

Tedious, stupid game that amounts to a simple algorithm.  Once you get that, the game is completely predictable from the first few turns, maybe the first one.  And why can't these designers acknowledge the awful reality that was Puerto Rico by naming the playing pieces for what they really represent?  "Colonists," my butt.  The dark counters represent slaves.

What a great game.  Every play can affect how it helps you or helps those you are playing against.  The strategies could be endless depending on how everyone else is playing.

Pros:

+ The turns are fast.

+ A fine euro.

Cons:

- I did not get the right seat/buildings (part of it might be experience, but my long term investment goes preferably towards go): I felt like I was in a trap: that was not fun. (Basically I was not able to do much with my specialty [Indigo] because the player just before me did the same thing, and with a warehouse (?) to stock it, on top of this.)

- On top of this, you do not know clearly who is just in front of you in points, so I could not even have the meaningful goal of trying to pass him.

- Lack of much social interaction.

Overall: a fine euro where one can be stuck and feel powerless, with not even a small "sub-goal" to fight for (like beating the opponent just in front of you), and littl interaction.

Waited a while to enjoy this game, and it is a marvellous game. There's not been too much talk about this game (though it is very highly rated), but it is a relatively old euro so it's probably because the newer games like Agricola and Caverna dominate the talks. Even though the first time I played the rules were screwed up on almost every turn, I still had a lot of fun playing it. It doesn't play that long, because everyone only has one action a turn, so it flies by quick. It's also quite possibly the most strategic game I've played, you have to think multiple plays ahead of you at a time, and it combines with being very competitive as everyone's moves are similar to yours (which, compared to other euro games like Agricola where you can just relax and do your own thing, means you basically have to out-strategize your opponents to win). This game is probably not going to be for everyone, but I love this game, even with the mishandling of the rules. It's just great to play a game where you're almost always going to win because you completely outplayed and outsmarted your opponents, something that you don't get in a lot of other games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The rules can be understood at the first time. You have to know what the roles are, what buildings are there and what they do, and keep a close eye on the handling of the roles. The first time I played it, I thought it was far from clear what was now a good tactic. But after a few times the good depth and the excellent balance of the game become clear. It is not a game that you 'just start playing' within fifteen minutes, but it is absolutely worth it to start. Special if you like Eurogames.
I think the game is diverse and well balanced. You are also constantly busy with something. After a few games, the two main tactics quickly become clear: whether you go for a large production of cheap products so you can gather glory points in the role of captain, or you go for the expensive products, to sell them for a lot of money and thereby building expensive buildings that generate many fame points. You also get more and more insight into how you can bother your opponents. Whichever tactic you choose: it turns out that the points are never very far apart at the end. The few times we played, we ended up with around thirty-five points, with the difference between the highest and lowest score being five
Good stuff with wooden raw materials and settlers, and thick cardboard game boards, plantations and buildings. The whole looks colorful and of good quality.

El juego de juegos, un clásico, el número uno de la lista  BGG y por tanto en las preferencias de muchos jugadores de juegos de tablero. Una compra IMPRESCINDIBLE para engrosar la ludoteca ideal de cualquier aficionado al género.
Un juego que asienta sus bases en la gestión de recursos y la construcción de edificios mientras se asumen diferentes roles (capitán, constructor, colono...) en el Puerto Rico posterior a la conquista del Nuevo Mundo.
Un juego que lo tiene todo: una alta adictividad, mucha rejugabilidad y una profundidad y diversificación estratégica como pocos en la que radica la grandeza de este magnífico juego; y es que Puerto Rico puede jugarse de diferentes formas, tomando distintos caminos y alternativas que te llevarán a la victoria, al tiempo que permite poner trabas y bloquar la estrategia del rival... y él a ti.
Si bien pueden jugar hasta 5 personas, para poder disfrutar de una gran experiencia a PR personalmente recomiendo partidas con 2 (un auténtico duelo) y 3 jugadores.
Inconvenientes a Puerto Rico: No es un juego para toda la familia ya que requiere cierta dedicación,y quizá su duración y el relativo esfuerzo en la comprensión de las reglas de juego puedan echar atrás a jugadores ocasionales, pero una vez se comprenden las normas y se está inmerso en una partida de este fascinante juego estos tres factores quedan relegados en favor de una gran experiencia de juego. El juego de los jugadores. ¿Qué más se puede pedir?

Una buena estrategia general para cualquier partida podría ser esta:
1: Diversificación en materias primas añade posibilidades en las fases de Mercader y Capitán, además de ser una estupenda combinación con los edificios de 2.
2: Es importante tener siempre un almacén a tu disposición; si es grande te puede permitir hacer bloqueos navales con más facilidad y si es pequeño puedes combinarlo con alguno de los edificios de 3.
3: Un muelle propio o el edificio de "+1 PV al enviar mercancías" pueden combinarse muy bien con los almacenes.
4: "Vender mercancía repetida" combinado con "+1" o/y "+2" doblones por venta es una combinación genial/fatal si está en tus manos o en las del rival (no hay que dejar que esto ocurra), pero puede paliarse con la "fábrica". 
5: Es preferible comprar edificios violetas "grandes" que más favorezcan al rival antes que te favorezcan a ti, ya que de todas maneras te otorgan 4 PV al comprarlos y generalmente la ventaja que otorgan es relativamente baja.

We're probably one of the last people to the party, but we finally got a copy of [thing=3076][/thing] in the last B&N sale.  We're big fans of Puerto Rico's children games ([thing=8217][/thing] and [thing=28143][/thing]), but we never had a chance to try the original.  Although we heard some mixed things about the two-player game, we found that the official variant was actually pretty good---it felt a lot like two-player San Juan or Race so it was easy to just dive right in.  It didn't feel like a variant at all.  In fact, we felt that the ability to take two roles per turn helped to make the game feel more strategic.  

However, I can start to see some faults in the game for us.  The lack of randomness seems like it will lend itself to scripted game play (we're already settling into a couple of the same strategies each game).  Plus, the lack of randomness can make the game pretty unforgiving and "mean"---in one game, I was able to lock up both ships and my wife had to throw away all of her goods.  After that, she was basically out of the game.  While we like this type of game, I think that the role selection mechanism is more suited to the cardplay of San Juan and Race (and maybe [thing=19857][/thing]?), since the randomness requires more creative play and is more forgiving to players.  

Still, it's a game worth trying for just two---it really is an elegant game and it's wonderful how each action interlocks with each other to make something more than the sum of its parts.

Bought this one entirely based on its rating here at BGG. Although everyone has liked it when we play, for one reason or another we don't play it enough for the rules to become second nature and strategy to really develop. It may be the abstract and indirect ways you must use to actually affect the other players... my wife claims it's just the amount of setup time compared to San Juan (which she prefers - I do not)

A family favorite.  What I particularly like about this game is the lack of randomness and the multiple ways to achieve victory.  Although I have one minor strategy that I usually try to employ, each game is different based on what others do and how I decide to play (as opposed to getting stuck into any single strategy or having bad luck force you down an avenue).

A tedious facsimile of fun, this heavily stodgy hard-core Euro would later lend its role-driven mechanics to the (arguably!) more successful "Race for the Galaxy" franchise. Given the widespread availability of Tom Lehmann's finest moment, I hardly understand the impetus to suffer through this, its outdated, outmoded, and fairly inferior ancestor. A fail on all accounts. (Gods, how I am bored by this one!)

RATING: 9
Revised from 8 up to 9.

(Comment on second game) A four year gap between games.  I realise now how elegant the game is with the interaction between each element.  The relationships of the cards have a clear logic and the flavour of them provide a coherant driving force to gameplay.  My development of warehouse plus harbour and increasingly taking the captain in the latter parts of the game provided a strong coherant strategy but also provided a believable narrative to the game and my game experience.

Though each player has their own version of the island due to the variety of options none are the same.  A Puerto Rico multiverse.

It is incredible how within a few simple mechanisms you not only have the framework for an excellent and competitive game but a context for a realistic and rich environment.  A tour de force.  

(Comment on first game) With a bit of patience maybe some coaching from experienced players you will realise the subltety, the flavour and the contrasts and see that Puerto Rico flourishes into a fine wine (or maybe more appropriately a very strong coffee). . . yes a very strong argument can be made for making it the finest blend.

In retrospect I realize that the one thing one should NOT do with this game is play it on BrettSpielWelt more than once or twice. [previous comment: "Certainly a good game, but I just can't play too often without significant breaks. PR is the most sensitive game I know to differences in levels of players, and that can become very frustrating very quickly. Plus I absolutely detest setting it up - and I always get to do that cause I'm fastest. Talk about an odd barrier to enjoyment!"]

Great game - love the tactical element to this game and the way each game varies so markedly despite only minimal random elements (the plantation draws).  Mostly played with 3, but lately have played a couple of games with 4 and it really shines at this number.  My wife's favourite game.

My first game was 2-players with my significant other and it was fabulous. One thing is I regretted not learning this game earlier. It was really easy to learn and teach, especially when you're more familiar with the medium-heavier weight games. Also, we know Race to the Galaxy so we understood the roles easily. In 2-player the game was pretty easy-going. We just did things according to our pace so we really enjoyed the experience. In my second game, it was a 5-player game. I was worried that it would take too long to play, but that was not a problem at all as everyone got to do something as a role gets taken during every person's turn. We cheered when someone took a role that helped us and we jeered when someone selfishly took a role that only helped themselves. Either way, we had a really fun game and my only concern is whether this game will become stale over time especially after you've discovered most or all possible tactics or strategies. 

I still prefer Agricola to this. But this is a very, very close second as of now . :)

A nice game of timing various steps of production and development.

A truly brilliant design that I have a great deal of respect and even admiration for.  Unfortunately, that brilliance doesn't make a connection with me when I'm actually playing it.  I think the fact that good play depends on heavy calculation of variations, combined with potentially plan-shattering multi-player chaos just doesn't work well for me.  On a more tangible level, the level of play that this game has received, unforeseeable during the design process, has shown that there is not just a hierarchy among the buildings, but actually a rather distinct hierarchy, to the point where being shut out of two of the "big three" (factory, harbour and wharf) makes winning extremely difficult, and it only takes a mistake or two to get into that position, while, conversely, taking one of a few other buildings (office, university, large warehouse, perhaps the hospice) is rarely, if ever, a quality play.  On a related note, for some reason the constraints on the number of copies of each building that are available in a game feel glaringly artificial and inelegant amid the rest of this design.  Still, despite these comments focusing on the negative parts of my perception, I do play this game willingly when asked, and once in a blue moon on my own initiative.  Also, my feeling that my criticisms are highly particular to me does not only arise because this is the number one rated game on BGG :)

UPDATE: have now played this face-to-face, and it was quite fun.  It seems I'm more immune to flying bits than I thought I'd be.  If, after another couple non-online plays, the fun stays the same, this may get bumped back up to an 8.

UPDATE: okay, it's up to a 7.5. I'm just not likely to suggest it, since there several other games in this category that I greatly prefer (PoF, Goa, T&E), so it's not a full 8, but it's more fun than a 7, which feels like a half-hearted recommendation.

Once my friends and I learned the basics of the game we spent months trying out new strategies and styles of play. We played 2-3 games every week for over a year. Even still we play when we get the time )and people together. I love the balance and strategy that every role has. 

Recently I got my hands on the expansion and have only played one game with it. Until I get more play under my belt I can't be sure what I think of the expansion.

2004, from Orc Nest.
(played the two players variant)
After sitting in the dust for more than one year, this gem finally get on to our table. It was hard for me to learn the rule before i can explain to my wife. And the functions of each characters and the building can be quite daunting to a new learner. 
So, i spent a lot of time studying the rules. And when i explained the rule to my wife, she looked scared!

However, when we started to play it, it was a blast!!! We started to pick things up, and learn it. It is not that difficult as it looks like!

A very enjoyable game. We like it.
Initial rating is 9, but, it might jump up to 10.

Updated: A truly 10. My wife asked to play it everynight. After every game, we talked about the strategy, and what we will do in the next game. We can never have enough in this game.

RATING: 7
To me Puerto Rico is a good, but not great game. I don't know, maybe it's because I am not particularly good at this game and am missing out on some strategic elements. But the role selection while cool to me does not warrant it being at one point the #1 game on BGG (especially when where you sit relative to new/experienced players can give a considerable advantage/disadvantage). Also, outside of the role selection, all I see in this game is a dry shipping goods around in the Caribbean (the colonists are slaves jokes are getting old).

After buying this game for a year, at last i get to try it out

I think it is good game (not the best) with little luck factor involved.  I found the game a bit dry and lacking in theme.  There are multiple strategies to win the game and i think it has high replayability..
the mechanism is quite simple and everybody can grasp it in a few turn...

Overall i would rate it below Agricola due to its theme and fun to play...


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
While using solid mechanisms in good combination to each other (I like the variable turn order), this game lacks a nice artwork or theme. In other games I am a Knight, an Alien, a Soldier or a hero. Here I am a wooden cube in different colors. 
For being in my top games it needs much more interaction between the players und more options in the mid and late game especially. Sometimes it seems like you don't have any choices to make in a round and the game starts playing you rather than the other way around...And that is the point where you can wait and see you winning or losing without really having the power to controll that.

Oh, my god! This game is awesome! First, I am form Puerto Rico and love that there is a great game out there named after my birthplace. Second, I really liked the logic of the design of it. In the first rounds (years) the sequence of the roles is very similar because the players don't have the resources or buildings yet but as the game progresses and the players build and produce, the mechanics change more to the strategy involved in making your city more successful than the other players'. I really love this game. I see ourselves playing it for years to come.

I've wavered on this game in the past, but recently I think it hit home.  I really liked this game.  No auction involved, but lots of dynamic play due to the nature by which the roles are drawn by the players.  The adding of money to the unused cards is interesting.  Very well thought out, but a lot of little rules.  Whenever I've had a break from it, we tend to forget a rule that we discover later.

I really like this game and the decision-making involved, but it has a hint of dryness that knocks it down a bit for me.  With that said, I think this game is a must-have for any serious or even quasi-serious gamer.

UPDATE:  The more I've played Puerto Rico, the more I enjoy it.  I have gotten better at the game, and this has increased my enjoyment because I understand what I am doing.  It is one thing to recognize depth in a game, and another to truly understand it.  I feel like I am beginning to understand PR's depth and this makes it all the more fascinating.  Consequently, the game is less "dry" and a lot more fun.

Upping my rating to a "9," from an "8."

UPDATE:  This is a game that stands the test of time.  A classic.  Far better than most games around it in the BGG ratings.

This game was like driving a new car. When you first get it it's fun to drive and you can't wait to hop back in again. Still fun to drive, was a 10 now down to a 9. A little bit of the luster has worn off but still gets you to where you want to go.

Puerto Rico is simply the best.  Every decision is very important.  This game has a lot of interaction, requiring you to keep track of what is good for you as well as what is good for your competitors and anticipating which roles they are likely to take.  A lot of fun.

What I like about the game is that everyone gets to do something on every turn, and everyone has some advantage over the others depending on what role they choose. What I don't like is that choosing those roles and those actions seems almost perfunctory at times.

A 10-year classic, still a decent game.  I have found with repeated play that if, by luck of turn order and plantation tiles available to you, your strategy follows down the shipping goods path, your actions are automatic and boring.  Even if it ends up being the winning strategy.  One game all I ever did was alternate Captain and Craftsman on my turn, everyone at the table knew what I was doing, and I still managed to win.  I could have written down on a napkin the decision tree and had the napkin play for me the rest of the game and win.  Meh.  Disappointing.  TTFN.

I bought this over a year ago.  I have played it 2 times.  I just can't get into it.  First of all, the play order makes no sense to me and I always mess up.  Second, keeping track of what thing has what impact on what other thing just drives me crazy.  I find I get really bored with this game and practically have to be begged to play it with friends that enjoy it.

I never liked this game as much as other people, and I finally figured out why. There is a culture of hardcore PR players who always seem to know exactly what the best move is. I am not one of those people. Hardcore players, I've found, usually fall into two groups: the ones who constantly tell you what role to take; and ones who are visibly upset when you don't choose the 'right' role. Both of these types COMPLETELY RUIN THE GAME for casual players. This won't change and I predict the PR backlash will only grow as these people act more and more asinine. If you are one of those types, please take note and stop ruining other people's fun.

When I first encountered PR, loved it. Now, I agree with a BGG user who put it on their Geeklist of "Games of Diminishing Returns" (in terms of enjoyment). It has been analyzed to death, and one needs to study-up on it to play anymore - like learning opening moves in Chess.  Keeping an eye on everyone's player board to see who is leading is also a minus for me.  And, in line with THE great controversy on BGG, I'm not happy with games that involve slavery, minus any consequences to strategies that employ slavery (i.e., no uprisings, revolts, loss of victory points or other such reprecussions). I find San Juan the card game to bring much more bang for the buck with the "develop colonial Puerto Rico" theme.

All that being said, I do understand it to be a very good game, and I do enjoy it still.

NOV. 09 Update: Over time I'm finding I enjoy this game as an occasional game, perhaps a few times a year, much more than I did when first introduced to it.

One of the best games ever designed.  It is a really brilliant role selection game.  It has a simple economic system and relatively simple rules.  I view this as the perfect transition from family game to more serious Thematic or Euro game.  It has depth although it does now suffer a bit from optimization and experienced players can be very difficult to beat.

Overall, it is a excellent game and I would always play it if offered.  I have played this with the family and even relatively younger children (8 year or so) can understand the game.

PR is a good game seemingly full of options and with essentially no luck.  The only drawbacks I've found are that the setup can be a bit of a pain and there can be a bit of a learning curve for new players. Otherwise, it plays well with any number of players 3 to 5 and plays as well online as it does face to face.  I am starting to feel that PR could be played out--there is a sort of sameness to it now.  Still, it's a great game to discover with other new players and learn the strategies on your own.

I know that everyone seems to love this game, however I am not sold completely.  This is one of those games that you can only be good at it, if you play a lot and know the different strategies.

RATING: 3
Originally rated this game higher, but dropped it's rating to a 5.  I've found that games that do not rely on any luck at all often rely on the interaction of players to determine the outcome (naturally).  The problem here is that one bad player can give someone such an advantage that it doesn't matter what strategy the other players use, whoever sits in the beneficial spot related to the poor player (usually to his left) will win regardless.  I've decided that I'd rather have risk managment decide my games rather than a poor player.

Dropped the score even more (from a 5 to a 3), as I realized I basically never want to play it again.

I thoroughly enjoy Puerto Rico. It was my very first role-selection game and its still one of my favorites. I enjoy the deep strategy in this one. The only thing I don't like about this one and games like Agricola, is that it feels very...solitaire-ish. Everyone has their own little boards trying to perfect their own "money/resource/etc." machine. Sometimes I want more player interaction.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This game, while admittedly having very well design mechanics, is incredibly boring to play. You are basically playing solitaire on a resource optimization game and only indirectly ever interacting with fellow players. I love well designed euro games, but this one is so stale and dry that I can never get behind it.

It's a very good game, and for all the reasons that people have cited above.  But I do think the hangup over who chooses to manufacture (helps the others), the length (tedium) of the game, and the general "Who won? Really?" factor takes away from its overall enjoyment.

Players have a lot of control over what is going to happen in a turn trying to make the best move to benefit yourself the most and your opponents the least.

Stunningly good game.  Lots to do all the time.  Having played it several times I'm a bit concerned that big buildings are too successful a strategy but possibly that will self-right when other people start competing for them.   And sitting to the left of the least competitive player is certainly an advantage.

PR seems to be an elegant, balanced, game that requires careful thought with every turn.  Lack of art work/graphics on the buildings is disappointing, but the game's mechanics are well designed.  

Each person picking a role makes it very interesting, and studying how your choice will benefit you vs. the other players is very interesting.

While the overall strategy after only 2 plays seems building vs. production/shipping (or combination of the two), there seems to be many ways to get there - and you might have to change as each turn you don't know what the others will do to force an adjustment to your plans.

Superb game! Rules are not so hard a new player can't jump in, but the game is rich and strategic enough for heavier gamers to really enjoy it as well. Settlers got me interested in boardgames, but Puerto Rico really got me *hooked*! (Update: bumped to a 9.5, hard to see turning a game down, it gets even better with time and with stronger players)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Warning: rating exclusively based on online (BSW) play. A great game; maybe a little bit on the dry side, but elegant, brilliant design, with almost no downtime and a lot of decisions to be made. Replayability is extremely high; after  70+ games, I still want to play it. Two minor quibbles: most of the decisions are tactical (short term) in nature, and a mistake by one player can give a huge advantage to someone else, thus leading to a "kingmaker" problem (but this is next to impossible to avoid in multiplayer games). If you're looking for a light, fast game which can be played in under an hour while still giving a satisfying experience, look no further.
UPDATE: over 100 online plays now, almost exclusively with basic set, and I still love to play. Rating up from 8.5 to 9. Definitely great.

This is fearsomely well-designed. I am a usually a sucker for good-looking high-priced games (like Days of Wonders), but Puerto Rico shames all that surperficial glitter, and makes it all come down to strategic depth and interaction. And on those accounts, Puerto Rico outraces most other games.

If someone published a chromed up version, with glossy artwork, little statuettes of the roles, mini-meeples for workers and what not ... then I would have to raise my rating to 10 ;-)
... and now they did (but I don't have it yet).

I played the prototype at Essen the year before it came out. I am almost a bit proud that I predicted the success of this game correctly. The idea of choosing an action that is then played by all players in order to reduce downtime is just great. Everything else also just fits. This game has set new standards for game mechanics.

Downgraded due to lack of direct interaction.

A good skill game with not a huge amount of luck involved. Sometimes you get lucky with timing and who needs to play cards at times that benefit you, but often you can see that coming and work it to your advantage.

Learned it with two other newbies. Took us about 1/3 of the game just to figure out the mechanics, due to the rules reading like poorly translated German, which is probably what they are. But when I figured out the Trader/Captain roles (how do we get vps? how do we get money? were our main questions) lovely light bulbs went on in my head, and I really enjoyed the remainder of the game. J's head hurt a bit from it but I think she'd play it again. B liked it I think.

I like it so much that I would rate it 8 or 9, reserving the highest ratings for games I absolutely LOOOOOVE. These days I am obsessed with Carcassone because mostly due to how many fun games I can play in an hour (3 to 4), whereas Puerto Rico would be over an hour per game.

Only a couple of plays, but we can see why folks like this game so much. We've played and enjoyed San Juan a lot, and this game is deeper and better. It can be a bit tedious to setup and manage all the complexity, but it plays well just the same. I'm sure we will get a lot of enjoyment from the game. We haven't played it with two players yet. If it works well, it will be icing on the cake for us.

Not sure if it actually is the first of it's kind, but IMO this is the king of all worker placement games.  It's the game that introduced me to the worker placement game mechanic and it plays brilliantly.  It's so deep and so excellent.  Slightly a little less fun for me now since I've played this game a couple hundred times most likely - all online or iOS - still dying to play this game live with a group, but haven't yet.  I have the board game version but sadly never even opened it. But there are some great digital AI versions out there that have kept me happy for years.  Understanding and playing this game also really helped me understand and play other games - Race for the Galaxy for one.  I never really understood RftG until I really comprehended the whole worker placement and role picking strategy element. Once that clicked for me it opened another whole world of games.

Lots of Corn   Wharf = the guy who doesn't really understand what's happening wins.

I don't know why I bought this game or why I bought Princes of Florence.  I'm guessing I was seduced by their high ratings on the Geek, and they were two of the first I bought since coming to this site.  I've learned, since then, that GeekBuddies, Session Reports and Reviews are the best ways to scout out game purchases.

Intimidating at first, due to the multitude of pieces.  But, once you get past that, it's actually a lot lighter game than it looks.  Once we started organizing the game pieces with token trays, I started liking the game a lot better because the setup time was greatly reduced.

many simple concepts makes this a well rounded semi-complicated game.  Low amount of randomness and more about being one step faster than your opponents.

It's obvious why this game held the top rating for so long.  The turns involve players selecting roles.  Everyone gets to take part in each selected role, but the selecting player gets a special bonus.  Unused roles get coin added to them to make them more attractive the next round.  It's really an ingenious and very fun system that leaves room for a lot of strategy.

The players are plantation owners in Puerto Rico in the days when ships had sails. Growing up to five different kind of crops—corn, indigo, sugar, tobacco, and coffee—they must try to run their business more efficiently than their close competitors: growing crops and storing them efficiently, developing San Juan with useful buildings, deploying their colonists to best effect, selling crops at the right time, and, most importantly, shipping their goods back to Europe for maximum benefit.

A nigh perfect game - balanced, rather intuitive in spite of its depth and complexity, very interactive, lots of different paths to victory and a reasonable playing time.

RATING: 8
Puerto Rico is a tough one to rate.  It really is a great game and fun to play.  Much easier to get into than today's 'medium-heavy' euros because it doesn't try to throw a handful of different mechanisms together, but still offers multiple strategies that are fun to explore.  However, it just doesn't get pulled out very often any more.  I have a handful of role selection games that I jump to first, such as Race for the Galaxy & Eminent Domain.  I don't see it ever leaving my collection, but it's not the first game I look to pull off the shelf when wanting to play a medium-ish strategy game.  

I think I prefer Race for the Galaxy and Eminent Domain because there is more randomness in each game, which can make each play feel different.  That just means Puerto Rico isn't likely to rack up as nearly many plays as those games for me, but it's still a great game.

Played once on 3-18-06, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  This game has to be played with the right type of gamer.  Newbies who enjoy simpler fare like Ticket to Ride may become frustrated at first with the unfamiliar complexity of the game, while others will enjoy the decision making and planning.

[b]UPDATE 4/23/06:[/b] After a weekend of gaming with my group, this has vaulted to the top of our 'must-play' list of games, right next to El Grande.  Even the new players got a kick out of it, prompting me to regret not having bought it sooner.  This will see a lot of repeat play.

[b]June '06:[/b] Definitely a group favorite.  Has become so popular that it's usually the first thing out on any given Friday night.  Well deserving of its number one spot.

By all accounts a good game with solid mechanics and deep strategy - yet for some reason I tend to like this game less than some people - I'm not sure if it's because of the theme or in my experience how it's easy for one player just to get in a cycle that is hard for the other players to break.

Update: lowered my score after realizing that the seat you're in makes a big difference in your likelihood of winning the game.  I see this as a flaw and don't understand why so many people are able to overlook this and rate it so highly.

Also, I think I just prefer more casual games, without so much emphasis on making perfectly efficient and correct choices in order to have a chance at winning.

I love San Juan though, and recommend it to anyone who likes the theme and mechanics of PR, but prefer something lighter.

RATING: 5
Lots of fun and not as complicated as it looks.  However, it can be a little broken with one or two new/weak players making questionable decisions.

After more plays, I have gone from an 8 to a 6, as the ability for one player's bad decisions to tilt the game becomes frustrating for me in a game with so little luck.

And from 6 to 5.  Just not much love left in me for this.

I once considered this a good game, but as time progressed and I played this more and more it started to wear thin. I can understand the uniqueness of this game when it was new and as long as everyone playing is at about the same level it can be pretty good, if a little scripted.  However, It is so much the same each time and so predictable I have little desire to play it. The game is usually won by the player who gains the biggest advantage either through seating advantage or through poor play of another player. There is little control other than you running the engine as best as possible. For me the fun in this was gone once I understood the game enough to know how that engine ran. Now it is a boring game of over analysis that in my group turn into hours of needless bickering of how someone could have played better. 
Never does this game come down to masterful play by the winner. 

To play this with a person who is new or not at your level is a complete waste of time. (I would rate it a 2 in that situation) 

Played again for the first time in about 18 months (June 08) and man I can say that little desire has turned into no desire to play. Do not believe the hype on this game folks, it really is an exercise in understanding the scoring engine and making tactical moves to maximize your point and minimize others points each turn. If you like to figure out your score and then do some light math to figure out what other will score when taking each card then you probably will like this game. I for one find that rather boring. Never does this game create a memorable experience, in fact it is more fun to play this thing via the PR evolver spreadsheet than it is in a face to face game. I have play tons of this game and I can't remember the details of any of them. Compare that to something like Ti3 where I can tell you who won each game and how they did it. This game being ranked no 1 here is a classic example of groupthink combined with people not updating their ratings. PR is stale, its old and it really isn't as good as you remember it. There are a few set strategies that win all the time, the programmed machine nature of this game make it so that the game engine just runs itself and there is little you can do to stop anyone not directly to your left. Once the fun of learning the engine fades then this thing is a boring exercise in  score keeping.

Top-notch, if not the best, as a typical Euro. Innovative mechanics, like role selection and variable phase order, work quite good. Well-balanced, many ways to win, many ways to be nasty and screw your neighbor.

However... sadly I have no attachment for a typical Euro. Its theme is stunningly boring. It's too logical. It allows only very indirect interactions. It feels very dry. It's over when it feels like a beginning. Its nastiness tastes bitter. 

And more, it has ugly artwork.

Dropped a lil bit in my ratings as I find myself not wanting to play every time this one is mentioned. It often feels that there is little that can be done to stop a leader in a runaway position. Time will tell.

Update 03/06/2006 (drops to 6.5)
Played yesterday and although fun, it's SO obvious that a poor player helps the one that follows after them that I think that determining your seating position at the start of the game is as important as any strategy during gameplay. I played an excellent game and came in 2nd to last. My brother in law (to my left and who came in last)repeatedly made role choices that helped the following player - who ultimately won. I'm having a hard time stopping this ratings slide with a game that depends on so much on the experience of all players being equal. 

Update 09/15/2007 (rises to 7.5)
Played this again after a long hiatus. It has regained some of it's luster as we were all newbies again and the game play felt much less scripted.

RATING: 6.8
First impression: 8

4 games in a row for a first time play session with a game speaks good things in my opinion (add to this that the last game ends at 2 a.m. wishing to have a fifth game).

Some random toughts:
- For me the art is far from nice, but it is functional
- I don't think the game is a multiplayer solitare at all
- If you are not super obsesive about winnig and hyper-analytic with game mechanics, I don't see any obvious flaws in game play
- I don't think the game is too complex (in fact we play with a 12 year member that beat us in the first game), IMHO the rules seem complex but after the first play you are ready to go (set asyde strategy...)
- I would say that if you are going to play frequently, probably is better to play wiht the same group, as the game have a steep learning curve regarding strategy

For me it deserves it deserves it status as a modern classic, maybe it's not for everyone, but no doubt is a pretty good game.

---------------------------------------------------------

Update: 6.8

After a few more plays I'm thinking the game is maybe too dry, and needs some more excitement... anyway I thing is a good game, but I'm not so sure if I'am willingn to play it that much, hence 6.8

Very good, complex game.  Your strategy may change depending on the # of players and what those players happen to be doing.  

The one downside I see is that your game can be hurt by newbies, or players who simply do not understand the strategy of the game and make moves that help other players more than themselves--of course, you might be helped by this, but it's still frustrating.

Despite that factor, this is a solid game.  I even enjoy the 2-player variant.

The expansions are nice: They alter the strategy just enough to keep you on your toes.  Worth picking up, especially because they're so cheap!

The game mecanisms of Puerto Rico are beautifully interlocked, all effecting eachother in intuitive, subtle ways.

Part of this game's fun is to develop and try out new overall strategies. There are several ones that seem to work about equally well, but their success always seem to depend on the stategy the others choose.

On a tactical scale the game is outstanding as well. What Role to pick? What building to buid? What goods to ship in which boat first? Etc. And what will the other players do?

And constantly you are aware that your opponents are trying to guess your decisions and you are trying to outguess theirs.

Finally, the rules are clear, the theme fits smoothly and the playing pieces are fine!
I cannot imagine a better game in its genre!

Puerto Rico is an okay game, but I liked Race for the Galaxy MUCH better and I also own San Juan. I haven't played Puerto Rico with more than two players, but I expect that more players improve the game exponentially. I almost always play with just two so it wasn't the best fit for us.

Le principe général du jeu est celui de la gestion d'une colonie. Il va falloir planter, récolter et transformer vos produits agricoles, les vendre ou les exporter. 

Pour réaliser toutes ces opérations, il vous faut construire les bâtiments nécessaires et faire venir des colons de la vieille Europe. Le but est d'acquérir des points de victoire. L'argent, qui est le nerf de la guerre ne sert au final qu'à départager d'éventuels ex aequo.

Bastante estratégico y con un factor suerte limitado al máximo (la adquisición de plantaciones).Es un juego que se juega tranquilo, con menos interacción obvia y ruidosa y que hace que se desee jugar de nuevo por superación personal. Es decir, pese a que se pierda, queda la impresión que si UNO lo hubiese hecho mejor, con un mejor plan, se podía haber logrado algo más.UPDATE: baja de 8 a 7, porgue de solo pensar en su configuración inicial, ya no dan ganas de jugar. Voy a hacerme la idea de lograrlo.ENERO 2007: pese a la configuración latosa, sube a 9, porque aprendimos correctamente la regla del capitán: son varios turnos de embarco y no solo 1, como lo habíamos estado jugando. Adquieren importancia el Harbor y el Wharf.Baja a 7 en agosto de 2007, porque esta un poco esquematizado en su forma de juego.

Ultimate resource production\spending\trading\anticipation etc. A problem are aggressive combo strategies: I wonder what is the response for aggressive: Small Market, Coffee or Tobacco, Big Market, huge cash in, spend-spend-spend (but wisely please!)?

Decision-rich, but flows very smoothly considering the amount of stuff going on.  Very little downtime, and scales well for 2-4 (haven't played with 5).  One of my personal top 10.

Excessive study and analysis of "optimum" moves could spoil it.  Some burnout factor also, but still a great game.

RATING: 8
While definately a great game, one that was the most fun on the first play and less ever subsequent play.  I just don't enjoy it as much as I used to, and it is one that can suffer from extreme over analysis and deterministic play without the wide open many  good moves nature of Chess.  Often you are given only one viable option on your turn, making many of the decision points illusory.  Furthermore, it is quite fragile with inexperienced players.  Good, but nowhere near a #1.

Not my game. Player interaction too indirect for me and the random influence of a poor player seems to outweigh the effects of playing well too much.

An absolututely terrific game. Now one of my top 10 games of all time. No nauseating auctions, no voting, no down-time, very little randomization. The role choosing mechanism where everyone gets to do the role and the chooser gets first crack with a bonus is just perfect. Great strategic choices in role, building, plantation selections. And the new expansion buildings are great fun and really add to the permutations. Even inspired me to make up a set, just like the old days in Cosmic Encounter. Can't wait to try the 2-player variants. Do not miss this game! Update 2014-01-25: still one of my top 10 games, but don't seek to play this as much as the strategies have become a bit too rigid.

RATING: 9
Puerto Rico is every bit as good as I'd been led to believe, and it looks a lot more intimidating than it actually is. The mechanics interlock brilliantly, the tension level during play is palpable (especially towards the end), and there's plenty of turn angst to go around.

I absolutely love the role selection mechanic and the number of possible paths to victory. There's a good amount of room to plan ahead, but there are also plenty of opportunities to screw with the other players; it's an excellent balance.

Puerto Rico changed how I think about board games, and turned me on to games with greater depth and complexity. Playing it for the first time was one of my best board gaming experiences ever.

Puerto Rico is a very good economy game with variable phase order.  It plays well between 3 - 5 players.  Game time may lengthen with more players.  I find it to be a very tight strategic game and would categorize it under a Eurogame.  I did not rate Puerto Rico above 8.0 out of 10 because of its lengthy demand on thought without contributing more to its ability to create a fun environment.

Finally got to see what the hype was about.

It played okay, but didn't stand out.  It may be that I've played enough derivitive games that I'm not seeing it with the same eyes as folks who discovered it did.

Most of us were newbies, which helped since it was more forgiving of mistakes.  That said, I suspect that the game would get better as skill levels increase.  It was hard to tell how folks were doing and when I won I was quite surprised (feeling that my all-corn strategy was falling short).

I created a homemade copy of Puerto Rico. Colonists are not brown round disks, but soldiers from an old copy of Risk. The goods are hand-painted necklace beads which I managed to take from ny niece. (Don't worry, she let me :P). All the plantations and buildings are made from old Monopoly cards - the properties and chance/community chest cards. Each player board is made from a section of the 6-foldable Risk map.

Looks like a turned 2 bad games into one great one. :)

Efficiency, efficiency, efficiency, that's the name of the game. To be sure, most euro games focus on efficiency, forcing players to make optimal moves in order to be successful. What makes Puerto Rico unique? Well, nothing really, other than the fact that it is pretty darn boring. This game makes me appreciate pasted-on themes. What is wrong with pasting on a theme? Stone Age, Kingsburg, Alien Frontiers…there are tons of games with light themes, but they're still solid games in their own right, partly because they are fun (I understand that Puerto Rico is a shipping game, but it is SOOOO dry it feels like there is an absence of theme). While fun is a subjective notion, I don't see how anyone could have "fun" playing Puerto Rico. It's a great game for tournaments and leaderboards, for people that want to top their latest high score, but it's not for "most" people who want to have a fun time. It is beyond me how this game is still so highly ranked. It suffers from the same problem as Settlers, that is, it has been improved upon a thousand times over. This game clearly brought a lot of gamers into heavier games, and maybe into gaming in general, but that's no reason to inflate its rating to this point. I'm not saying I won't play it again, and I'm definitely not saying it is a bad game, but it's definitely in my bottom 10.

Puerto Rico is a game which I continue to enjoy more with each play. Once I figured out the mechanics, it became much more enjoyable.  The fact that one of my other favorite games is based off of this is no surprise either (Race for the Galaxy).

While I am not particularly convinced by the game's theme, the interactions between players is bar none.  Every time that someone captains a ship and I get left out it pains me, while being able to capitalize on something nobody else can feels like an achievement.  Tons of replability.  If you enjoy euro games, this is a must-have.

Only played it once and will wait with my rating and comments on the game. Too many people like this game for me to dismiss it after only one go. We played a 3-player game and none of us got hooked, it had a cheap feel to it and things you worked for didn't feel like an achievement if you managed to get them, many times you didn't though because someone screwed up your plans by mistake.

We were all tired and hadn't eaten properly.

Rating Potential: Likely needs the expansion for long term replay. Very well designed even if some of the negatives are true(if you do that, I do this).

Current personal Top 10.

The number 1 game on the geek. Plays 2-5. The game is good. Really good. The game has little luck which can lead to scripted play. Who acts before you (specifically what type of player they are and their skill level) is often more important than your own play. I prefer San Juan. 

Personally I rate this game (flaws and all) in my top 25. It doesn't make my top 10 however.

3-30-08 2-player v. Karen 67-66 Win. Factory with 4 goods (all but Coffee led to early cash) Built small office, then factory then wharf. Karen had large office and coffee for 7 dubloons per sale in the market.

5-11-08 
Karen, Sean, Ang, Moi. 37,43.40, 48
Ang had 10 vp build, 30 shipping. Karen had 15 build, 18 shipping, special (Fortress?) Sean had 20 build, 16 ship, 7 special, Moi had 24 build, 17 ship, 7 special (Guild Hall) 
Karen was first player. I went with (quarry grabbing building) and eventually Hacienda. My cash crop was coffee. I purchased a Factory and got into Sugar for 3$ per craftsman phase. I used my 3 quarries and Factor cash to buy a harbor,wharf and Guild Hall sequentially. The game ended in Sean's governorship (probably turn 12) I was faced with the prospect of shipping 1 barrel of corn for 3 VP or crafting, knowing I could ship 5 VP worth of coffe via the harbor in the likely event Ang picked captain, but not knowing if I'd ship any of my other goods. So I went conservative and eeked out a small win.

i have been tired of this game and dont want to play this game so much anymore. perhaps it will change after some time. i think it is always the same thing in this game. and i have noticed that it is actually only the 4-player game that is really enjoyable. 3 and 5 players are not fun anymore. anyway it is still a great game but you'll get tired of it if you play it to much. 

EDIT: itisone of the best games out there :)

RATING: 8
My first medium weight game. I really haven't played this as much as I'd like to but I really really enjoy the experience every time I do! The one complaint I have about this game is that it suffers from serious kingmaker scenarios. Whether intentional or not, a player can easily give the victory to the person to his left by suboptimal play

There is a reason this has floated around the number one board game slot for so many years.  It's really really good.  Another game like Agricola where the setup (particularly counting out the colonists) is very time consuming, but the game play is fantastic.

Perfect eurogame. Sequential role selection only works because the game is so perfectly balanced (or nearly). Haven't played enough to see if the small balance issues are a big deal. 

5/29/13: I'm not a great PR player but I am planning on incorporating the 'official' factory/university swap in my next game, along with having the corn players start with 1 less doubloon. There's an obvious different between what the corn players do and the indigo players, so this just makes sense. Played several games on TropicEuro to see how I liked it, and I'm sure this is a preferable way to play.

This is a strange game.  The mechanic is clever and elegant.  The boards look good.  However, I played it for the first time and... won!  Strange, isn't it?  It was probably due to the fact that only one of four of us was an experienced player (and I beat her by 1 VP;)).  The feeling of the game was rather chaotic, but I'll certainly give it a second chance some day.  Ah, and one drawback: the boards are small:).

Second game with 5. Increased my rating to 9 (was 8). It had been a while since we played, but everyone liked the game even more after this play. We seemed to do tons of shipping, and triggered the game end by running out of victory chips.

Easy to learn for a game that looks horribly complicated, and the role selection mechanism is beautiful - you're always involved in the game despite the pace of game being slow. However, it is long, fiddly, downright ugly to look at (even the building cards are just text), has a weird slavery theme, and it's kind of dull - nothing happens that is memorable (unless you can remember events like "oh, so-and-so crafted instead of captained, it was seriously sub-optimal"). For enthusiasts of careful resource management games only. Winning seems a matter of accumulating many very slightly better decisions, there is no killer play. Play seems very programmed, some buildings seem to be entirely ignored under all circumstances. Summary: clever game that's too long for what it is. Give me a game of Citadels any day.

RATING: 8.6
Great game, a lot of fun. PROS: strategic, a lot of different bonus building cards making it interesting.
CONS: kind of hard to set up because there are so many pieces; there is not very many goods (in production round, there is never enough goods for at least someone). The game kind of ends pretty soon (we wish there was more colonists and victory points to make the game last a bit longer, a long with more goods to supply everyone).

Rated 7.5 after 1 play:

Simple enough to learn in one sitting, but I can tell there is a lot of complexity lying there under the surface. 

Happy to play again, and expect to rate it higher with further plays.

Rated 9 after 3 plays (including anniversary edition plays):

Excellent game, well balanced from what I can see so far.  Keen to keep playing it.  Lots of different strategies available, tough choices, opportunity to mess with opponents and scarce buildings.

Definitely not what I'd call a gateway game.

After 4 plays: reduced rating after a 5 player game sitting to the left of a player who had more experience than the rest of the table combined.  Not enough direct interaction for my liking.

I never quite understood the hype behind Puerto Rico. To me, it's an OK game, at most. Setup time is ridiculously long for what it is. Also, if you have enough experience, you can win simply by sitting to the left of an unexperienced player (or lose by sitting to his right). Definitely try before you buy.

Played 12+ times.
Last play on July 27, 2008

I did have this at 9 after only playing it a few times.  But I have played it more times now and have decided to move it up to a 10 (my first).  The reason this has moved up is primarily because this game avoids one of my biggest hangups with games.  I hate playing a game where I feel like I have no chance of winning.  If about halfway through the game the winner is so far ahead that I feel I have no chance, I get bored.  But what is so great about this game is that you really don't know who is in lead. Most games the person we think is in the lead is not, and the person we don't think did well, is likely the winner.  

Just tried the 2player varient and found it just as much fun.

I haven't played this game in quite some time as we have been playing other games and our friends arn't as keen on this one, but I found it was just as much fun as I remember.

Just tried it with the expansion.  It totally changes the game up.  Very fun.  Gets you out of your own strategy rut.

De momento el juego que más ha triunfado con todo el mundo que lo ha probado de los juegos que conozco. Eso tiene que significar algo...

2018-01-31: Redondeo la nota a 9 (desde un 9,2).
A pesar de que solo tiene dos caminos básicos (construir edificios o embarcar mercancías) sigue teniendo suficientes estrategias dentro de estos dos caminos como para que siga siendo un gran juego con rejugabilidad más que suficiente. El juego que me descubrió los eurogames (de peso medio) y que hizo que me metiera de lleno en esta afición. Los hay mejores, pero Puerto Rico aguanta el paso del tiempo

I can't rate it yet: many game-mechanisms blend into 1 game (choosing role, worker-placement, civ/building), so many things to think about. Now I compare it a bit to Race for the Galaxy and I do like this one much more.

I've liked it best with a table of equal newbies, where I don't feel out of place. I like the role selection and the ability to have something to do on every turn; as well as the ability to do many things tactically to earn victory (even if I never seem to find the right combination.)

A building game where you have to build your town/plantation/economic engine to ship goods to the old world. It's tough to balance making points/money and giving your neighbors a chance to make even more. It borders on abstract/cube pushing, but I have seen a variety of strategies work.

I like this best with 3 or 4.  Haven't played with the expansion yet.  Looking forward to those tiles.  This is one of those games where you end and immediately want to play again. Even after the Agricola coup, I still think Puerto Rico has more to offer.

Update:  I think this game has gone the way of Settlers, Citadels, Bohnanza and all the other early rush games.  Completely played out and will NEVER suggest playing this again.

Very, very good game.  I almost cried when reading the rules, though -- they just seemed so convoluted and SO DARN LONG -- but the gameplay goes smoothly, it just makes sense.  Those I've taught verbally have caught on quickly.  Yeah, it's a great game, but you work so hard to get a fruitful little community going and then it's over before you can really reap the benefits.  Seems to me that doubloons should count for *something* in the scoring rather than just acting as a tie-breaker!

A lot of fun until everyone figures it out (about ten plays), then still a fun ride, but a bit mechanistic.  I suspect if all the people who rated it a 10 in 2002 went back and updated their rating with some honest perspective, the rating would fall quite a bit.  All the sour grapes folks who have an instictive reaction to hype would likely raise their evaluation with a bit more candor.

great game that keeps getting better with more plays. 

One thing I hate is having played it a ton early on, and then not playing for years I have the feeling of what is good to do, but cant remember all of what really works.  As it is only played once in a long while, I feel I spend 2/3rds of the game trying to remember it!

We (again) have made a commitment to play more often.  We shall see...

I printed scans of the expansion tiles.  It's looking like they are never going to be reprinted.

GF picked it up very easily after having played San Juan several times.  

Played standard 2p variant, no expansion.

She won 54-38, with most points via shipping and 2 10pt buildings.  I was playing mostly production and trade. Game ended due to running out of colonists in Captain phase.

I am not a fan of games that require:

1) Squinting to read cards/tiles (especially to see those of your opponents)

2) Memorizing all of the cards/tiles and their functions/combos prior to being able to play the game at a reasonably high level

I suspect this is why I am not a fan of some highly rated games such as [i]Puerto Rico[/i] and [i]Ora et Labora[/i].

That being said, PR is a well-designed game and there are aspects of it I enjoy.  The variable endgame is nice and I enjoy being able to select roles that thwart my opponents' plans.

----------

After having read the rulebook and playing without the expansion tiles, the game seems a bit more manageable. It's still not a game I would choose to play too often, but it's a solid 7 for me.

Good game, an excellent design best illustrated by the fact that I don't think I'll ever be able to play it particularly well.

I play it on iOS which has a nice implementation and animated/illustrated buildings and plantations. The original edition's board game is rather ugly with buildings just being little chits and having to scan around the table to see what you're denying opponents. 

I think the board game could be done much better, but, alas, even the 10th Anniversary Edition falls short.

I'm waiting to see if the game, reissued in German only recently, will republished again in English with some of the recent graphic improvements found in the 2014 Ravensburger edition. I can hope!

Simply the best game I played to date. The mecanics seems perfect.
***After 18 months of play, I still think this game is as close as perfection as you can get.
****3 years later I need to correct the fact that I wrote that this game was as close to perfection as you can get. After several plays we found buildings combination way better than other. Found that the game doesn't play equally good at all players configuration and takes longer to setup than most of my games(except Battlelore).
But overall, the game experience is still the best in my collection.

Good with 2 players.
Best with 3 players.
Very good with 4 players.

PR is a good game. It offers multiple strategies and multiple mechanisms that fit together well. Still it is not one of my prime favorites, because I prefer games with more interaction.

The best of the German games, "Puerto Rico" somehow manages to present a paralyzing array of strategic choices while still keeping the rules simple and clocking in at about 2 hours.  It also integrates its theme very well and avoids the weightless, abstract feeling that ruins many of the German games for me.  Only the limited interactions between the players and the fact that you can never just whomp somebody reduce this from a 10 for me.

Sometimes, you just have to visit your grandfather's house.

Eh, it's an OK game with some of the better interaction mechanisms for a Euro (in that you must closely watch your opponents). The game has infinite strategies but there are seemingly finite ways to win (does anyone ever win without the Factory first followed up by the Harbour & Wharf?? Each time I play I avoid that way but whichever player  does win uses that strategy though they are sometimes pushed close by other strategies.)

Used to be one of my favorite games. I had been searching for a "Puerto Rico killer" for a couple of years before I found (and loved) Funkenschlag.

I wonder how it will age though, since the game tends to get a bit predictable with experienced players, and very much in favor of experienced players versus not so experienced players.

Contrary to some expert opinions there's still various ways to win. And the best part: there's hardly any downtime in this game, once people are used to the game...

There's a reason this game has been ranked #1 on the Geek for so long.

Always great fun, and everyone feels like they have a chance to win.

Why limit the tokens then?Things like that.Overall though a very nice game.

This game got me back into Board games. before this gem, all i knew was Monopoly, Cluedo, Masterpiece, Hero Quest, and Talisman. 
But here was a game that threw out the dice! winning and losing was now completely up to you. i was in awe as i managed to tune my strategy just right so that the brilliantly laid out mechanics of the different phases started to click into place for me, and id watch and scheme as my city grew and the VPs came pouring in at the cost of my opponents!
Now though, this game for me is the Granddad sitting on the porch as he watches all the young whippersnappers, that he begat, pass him by and come to the fore. It no longer wows me like it used to.
Alas, i cant seem to part with my copy though, because it will always hold a special place in my gaming heart as my first love.

Aside from setup time (which is helped by creative packaging) this is a must play game. I find the game best (Playtime vs enjoyment) with 4 players. Five is probably the richest experience but time to play jumps quite a bit.

I lived with 2 room mates for 5 months and this was our favourite game. There is almost infinite depth and the game plays great with 3 players. I'm not the biggest fan of the theme and that is probably one of the only things holding this game back from a perfect 10.

This is probably my favorite euro. I fell in love with this game in 2002 when it came out (and I am really kicking myself for not getting the Puerto Rico Anniversary Edition in 2010 (?)).

I have probably over 30 undocumented plays with this game. All the criticisms are true: If you are playing after a weaker player, you are advantaged in the game.

Despite that statement, the range of viable strategies made this game brilliant back then. The action-selection mechanism was the first of it's kind.

Since then, I don't play it much, but I have a soft spot for this title in my heart. I would still play this game if someone offered.

This is a superb Euro-style game. I won't say that it's immune to criticism, but it's pretty damn good. 

One flaw is in scalability: the game becomes a building-race at 5 players; 3-player games don't have enough scarcity. For this reason, I'd recommend playing with 4. 

Table position also matters quite a bit in this game; having written a game with the same problem, I don't consider this fatal.

Game in a Nutshell: Gain victory points by shipping or selling crops to build a city. Be the best in managing what it takes to do just that by selecting limited roles each round.

Played as: 3,4,5 player

Pros: I like selecting different roles. The partial hidden victory points leave a sense of tension until the final tally. It's hard not to find someone who doesn't like it for one reason or another.

Cons: Sometimes I wonder if the game couldn't have been slightly more balanced so there would be more routes of equal opportunity to victory. While on the subject of routes to victory, the lack of randomness doesn't offer much incentive for going about a different strategy.

Other: I'm sure I could win this game a lot more if I executed the same strategy that's worked for me in the past. I prefer to try as many new routes just to avoid robot playing syndrome. I'd like to think more seasoned playing partners (myself included) would make optimizing the best strategy more interesting, but as for now, I'm bored of watching the same few strategies win every time.

Best Use: If you want to blow away the gamers still standing in gateway land yearning for more.

For reasons I can't articulate, this game turns me off.

All I'm sure of is that I don't ever want to play this again.

Love this game. The only thing that keeps this from being a higher rating is the way that having a new player on the table can have a drastic affect on who wins. I highly recommend playing the Puerto Rico Evolver AI to improve so you won't end up being that newbie!

RATING: 7.5
After numerous games, I still like Puerto Rico, despite all of its obvious flaws (scripted nature, processional feel, optimization instead of creativity, standard opening moves due to the starting situation always being exactly the same, etc). I used to only play it with 2 or 3, but now also enjoy it with 4. Still refuse to play with 5 though - too messy. Though direct screwage is difficult, one can still outwit opponents into forcing them to make moves they might not really want to make. PR is incredibly easy to explain to newbies for the broadness of the game, which makes it pop out time and again. I think I am getting close to, well not solving, but reaching a ceiling with PR though, since I do find myself performing more or less the same tactics each game. Three player games offer more economical flexibility (more gold on roles) so I still prefer these. In the end, tough, what is truely missing from PR is some "tightness" in managing your opportunities - you'll always get around to playing half-decent even if you're not playing very well. I'd still rather be punished by a game for messing up, which results in better, more competitive play over time (i.e., Age of Steam).
I will soon be trying the Expansion to see if some of the main issues with Puerto Rico becoming stale after extensive play can be resolved.
In short, I still value the "elegantness" of PR but am slowly but surely getting to the point where I'd rather pick something else for the same complexity/playing time/# of players involved. This mainly because, amongst experienced players, game strategy is actually only about the order in which things happen, and I'm not too sure I like that part so much.

Recommend reading frequently misplayed rules. There's many we missed. The theme is reasonably strong and little change is involved. The role selection and benefit mechanic is excellent. (2005) Not a fan that the game encourages people to critique other people's play. This makes it pretty unfriendly to play with serious games and casual games at the same time. (2012)

Well thought out, well balanced game.  The only random element in the game has very little effect on the players ability (in other words the game doesn&#039;t break with the right draw or a good dice roll).  Easily my favorite game.

RATING: 8
It's good but the major problem is that a player just before you can make a small mistake (specially with sending goods on wrong ship first) and suddenly you can win out of nowhere. That might annoy other players that can't do anything to prevent this.

Excellent game. Plays well (and differently) with 2-5 players.

Can tend towards a race for the good buildings, especially without the expansion set, since there are some buildings that are better value than others. Excellent nonetheless.

Can become a little scripted if you read the strategy guides or play with 'experts'. My rating reflects the fact that game has lost some lustre with me - admittedly after 100  plays.

Puerto Rico is my first strategy game. In this game you don't win just by luck. That's why you need a sound strategy from the beginning.
I think Puerto Rico is a very good game but I haven't played it much during these 5 years I've owned it. Perhaps it's because I don't have many friends who like to think too much in a game.
Boardgame enthusiasts should own this game as it is a good one, but it isn't a good game to people who want to have fun.

What else can be added to BGG's #1? It's fun, tense all the way,  takes the right amount of time, always different (every game needs a different strategy depending on what your opponents do), it leaves you wanting to try a different approach...

Strategic euro lives up to its hype.  Must balance need to ship out (variety) of goods with a single focused strategy on which building route to go for.

When I first played Puerto Rico, it blew my mind a bit - so many layers of complexity. I loved reading up on the different strategies; this is the game that brought me to the geek. I considered it worthy of its number 1 rank. (I suppose I still do - [gameid=31260] doesn't rock my bells.)

Recently, I played PR again for the first time in over four years. And while my opinion of the game hasn't really changed, I'm lowering my rating anyway, because my preferences have. Lately I tend towards shorter games that I can play more than once: [gameid=3], [gameid=36218], and yeah, [gameid=28143]. I'll keep part of my original comment though...

This is one of the few games that I consider both classic and good (also: 1830, Civilization).

It has a long playability especially if you add the expansions. I don't think that having a noob player right before you is that much of an advantage, cause they cannot be relied upon. It seems more critical to align with players (and exploit them) if they have the same strategy.

Puerto Rico was the first game - aside from Diplomacy - that I played regularly, and for that reason I always have a warm nostalgic feeling about it and the brown "colonist" tokens that work your plantations for free after arriving on a ship.

It remains an excellent game, from the lack of downtime to the role selection mechanism. I haven't really found another game quite like it.

I was interested in this game because of the hype.. almost bought and sure glad I didn't.  Played with some friends.  I like good production in a game... everything seemed plain and small to me...that wasn't a good sign.  Player interaction is minimal, game plays like a multiplayer solitaire, except its like you go to the bathroom and you kids took some of your cards, which messed up your game.  Thats PR, the only player "interaction" comes with someone taking a starting card you wanted.Some intesting mechanics, but some more complicated games of solitaire have interesting concepts...you see them, experience them, then your realize how boring a game this is.  Goes for most other Euros... what people see in them I will never understand :-O   I guess they would rate the games I like down... different strokes for different folks.

An excellent strategic game. Best in 4-5 players. Maybe it's repetitive after a lot of played games (produce the good, sell the good, build the buildings and so on).
Not so fun when good players and newbies plays together.
As similar games playing after a bad player is an advantage

RATING: 9
The complexity of play and depth of strategy involved (especially the requirement to take into consideration other peoples' possible moves) makes this game extremely challenging.  However, it's challenging in a very good way, and I can't wait to play more.  That there appear to be multiple strategies that could all lead to victory (but that still depend on the strategies other people are using) is exciting.  [Update Dec. 2007: This was one of the first games I reviewed, and thus the review isn't in the style of many of my other reviews.  But I'm going to leave it, because, well, this is just a great meaty game.  My 9 says it all.]

For sure it was once innovative and exciting. But a lot of designers made their own Puerto rico like games: build your own engines and interaction by action selection. And some of these (for me Agricola and Race for the Galaxy) are much more fun, offer more variety and look way better than Puerto Rico. So bye bye dry Puerto Rico!

2010-11: Got my first play of the #1. Having already played Race for the Galaxy, it was easy to understand the general idea. First impression is that I find RftG a more polished design, but I understand the appeal of PR in that there is very little randomness. I'll start this off as a 6, I wasn't wowed but I can see the appeal.

Time has dimmed PR's playing time a bit, but it's still THE role selection game for many of my friends.

PR was my gateway to a larger gaming world, and for that it's a top ten desert island 10 for me.

This review is being written many months after my last play, but in this case it doesn't matter at all. Puerto Rico is just a solidly fun game no matter how long I have had it. The core mechanics are grand, the theme is a good one, and the artwork always draws me in, too.

A great game, which shall always live in my collection, I am comfortable saying.

Players take turns picking roles and completing actions based on those roles. Strategy comes through targeting specific bonuses, and from preventing your opponents getting other bonuses.

The gameplay is super solid, and heavily strategic, but the pieces are flimsy. In all honesty, the game is excellent, but the production quality keeps me from giving it a 9.

My one play of Puerto Rico (several years ago now) is a bit of a dim memory. I recognize that it is a classic, but it's not a game I've been excited to revisit. I suspect this has more to do with its reputation as a game with "a book" where players are meant to follow certain play conventions, particularly in the early game than with the actual game itself. I'm unlikely to play it in a group of highly experience players anyway.

Euro games don't get much better than this one.

1/22/05 - Hypothesis: the best possible way to achieve victory is via 1 coffee crop and as many corn crops as possible.  Go for corn early, then a coffee house.  If somebody gets into the coffee business as well, get an office ASAP.  Add a small and large market as needed.  A great victory strategy... or so it seems.  You'll dominate the captain and trader phases.  Need I say more?

"Klasszik", az euro játékok egyik pionírja.

A játék központi mechanizmusa a szerepválasztás, de a legtöbb szerepválasztós játékkal ellentétben itt nem csak az aktuális játékos, hanem mindenki annak a szerepnek megfelelően végzi el az adott kör akcióját. Akkor mi értelme van? Egyrészt az időzítés miatt (behajózáskor pl. nem mindegy, ki kezdi), másrészt a privilégiumért. Utóbbi annyit jelent, hogy a szerepet választó bónuszhoz jut a többiekhez képest (több pontot kap ugyanazért az akcióért, drágábban tud eladni, stb).

A legzseniálisabb az egészben, hogy az igazán jó játékosok olykor a számukra megmaradt és látszólag kevésbé hasznos szerepek közül azt választják, ami a többieknek a legkevésbé felel meg, nem pedig azt, amivel rövid távon a legjobban járnak.

Ezek a szerepek:
 - iparos: termelés, privilégiummal egy termékkel több jár
 - kereskedő: termék eladás, privilégiummal eggyel több pénz jár
 - kapitány: behajózás (termékek hajókra győzelmi pontokért), privilégiummal eggyel több pont jár
 - építész: épület építése, privilégiummal eggyel olcsóbban tehető meg
 - polgármester: munkások beszerzése és letelepítése, privilégiummal eggyel több munkás jár
 - ültetvényes: ültetvény telepítése, privilégiummal kőbánya is választható (ami olcsósítja az építkezést)
 - aranyásó: egy pénzt hoz a konyhára, nincs privilégium (mivel senki más nem kap, csak aki választotta)

Az adott körben amelyik szerepet senki sem választotta, arra egy pénz kerül. Így azzal is taktikázni lehet, hogy csak azért választunk szerepet, mert már 2-3 vagy akár még több pénz van rajta.

Épületekkel tudjuk feldolgozni az ültetvényeken megtermelt terményeket (cukrot, dohányt, indigót, kávét, a kukoricához nem kell feldolgozó épület, viszont nem is ér sokat). Illetve egyéb extrákat is szerezhetünk építkezéssel (pl. több termék raktározható, játék végén plusz pontok szerezhetők bizonyos feltételek teljesülésekor, stb).

Bár egyszerűnek tűnik a képlet: telepítsünk ültetvényeket és feldolgozó épületeket, amikre tegyünk munkásokat (különben nem működnek), termeljünk, majd a termékeket adjuk el pénzért (amivel építhetünk) vagy hajózzuk be, amivel győzelmi pontokat szerezhetünk, de szinte soha nem fogunk az ideális sorrendben haladni, rengetegszer kell már körökkel előre gondolkozni, figyelni a többiek lépését és folyamatosan nehéz döntéseket hozni.

A pontozásnál nem érzem igazságosnak, hogy a megmaradt pénz és termék semmit sem ér (oké, döntetlen esetén az dönt, de az elég ritka szitu). Sokkal jobb lett volna 2/1 vagy legalább 3/1 arányban beszámítani ezeket is, mert gyakran fordul elő, hogy bizony még egy picike akció kellett volna a végére, hogy a maradékból győzelmi pontot csináljunk vagy megépítsünk egy 3-4 pontot érő épületet a pénzünkből.

Ezt eltekintve vérbeli euro, amit kár lenne kihagyni bárkinek is. A szabályok logikusak, jól érthetők, egyedül az épületekkel nem árt tisztában lenni még pluszban az első 1-2 játéknál, mert ismeretük hiánya jelentős hátrányt okozhat a játék során (muszáj átlátni, hogy melyik épület mire jó).

Csak azért nem adok neki több pontot, mert elég gyakori a kényszerakció, amikor kevésnek érzi az ember az opciókat és megint várhatja a körét, hogy végre választhasson mást (ha tud). Persze valaki meg ezt imádja (mazochisták előnyben). Ja, és kiválóan működik 2-3-4 és 5 játékossal is.

"Ha ezt nem próbáltad, nem próbáltál még semmit." (híres dakota indián mondás)

Update (2017.12.17.): eladva, mert nem nagyon került elő, BGA-n ha nagyon hiányzik, majd játszom vele.

Update (2018.01.29.): nem bírtam ki, megvettem a magyar kiadást, pedig BGA-n is játszottam vele azóta (nyilván erősen motivált, hogy a magyar kiadásban a két kiegészítő - új épületek és nemesek - is benne van)

RATING: 10
Another classic multiplayer game. Every time I play this game, I learn something new that makes me a better player. Also, the fixed roles (no cards) and turn ordering make this game one that you can analyze at a fairly deep level.  Good players still argue about the ideal first few turns.

While there is much hype over the new Euros that come out every year, I find this one to be just as engaging now as it was when I was first introduced to gaming.

There are a few flaws perhaps, such as the importance of seating, but I think a simple handicap system using victory points makes this work well. Also, if you are playing with a few suboptimal players, it comes down to which good player's benefits the most from what the person is doing (i.e. crafting too often, mayoring too often). 

Nevertheless my rating stands. Honestly, any skill-based game, especially a multiplayer one, will have those same issues.

RATING: 8
The first time I played it I loved it --- I'm a big fan of the role selection and the ability to choose strategies counter to the "prevailing mood" (e.g., shipping when only you have goods).  When I see opportunities like that, I love playing the game.

I'm less a fan of some of the start --- especially with experienced players, I tend to see "standard openings" which I don't know and I don't care to play.

Complex, but not the big deal everyone makes out of it. I am also a little disturbed that the "colonists" that work my plantations and factories are a symbolic dark brown color.... Subsequent plays confirm that this is just too dry for me. I'd rather play RTFG, possibly San Juan.

After doing some research, I realized that not only has this not seen the table in 9-months, two other people in my regular playgroup own it. It's just not worth keeping. Traded away 4/28/09

Well-designed and balanced, this pillar of the Eurogame genre has many positive facets.  Morphing strategies enable players to "catch up" in a non-linear fashion, and it's not always easy to tell who is going to win.

This got me back into boardgaming. It doesn't get old, though I do find that I get into a rut once I have sucess with a particular strategy (I find it hard to get away from my focus on shipping). To enhance the thematics, it is necessary to speak Spanish when playing. Like many cilization building games; it is politically problematic. As part of the theme of colonization, players ship in slaves to work their plantations. In the expansion, the "colonists" can be sold on the black market. Yikes.

simple to teach, hard to win :) there is much going on in reasonable amount of time. Everybody who says it is a multiplayer boring solitare game is wrong because if you want to win you must keep looking on other Player boards and still adapt your own strategy. In my opinion much shorter setup and gameplay makes this game superior to agricola or caverna :) And if I want to play something like agricola I would rather play Robinson Crusoe which is much more fun with almost the same worker placement mechanic and with extra survival thematic story ;)

RATING: 8
Like many other popular Euros, Puerto Rico is ostensibly an engine builder featuring the now tired process of gaining resources (money, crops) and converting them to victory points (buildings, shipping). But unlike these other games, Puerto Rico is not multiplayer solitaire in which you try to "solve" the [-]spreadsheet[/-] tableau/board before you better than the other players. Instead, Puerto Rico requires attentiveness to the other players' plans and the rhythm and flow of the game to do well. Furthermore, while it's largely a tactical affair, you do have to have a strategy in mind from the outset.

I can see the lack of variability becoming dull after a while, or maybe I'll become concerned with the seating arrangements. But I'm still too new to the game to really have much of a problem with this stuff yet. I'm looking forward to many more plays of Puerto Rico.

Really fun, but very heavy for newer players. Takes a couple of games to figure out what to do, and even then you're at a distinct disadvantage to anyone who has played it more. This is also why I enjoy it so much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I recognize that this is a well designed game; it's just that the few times I've played it have not been an enjoyable experience. This is mostly due to playing against a player who has "solved" the game while I haven't figured it out yet.  Maybe if I played with others at my level I would appreciate it more.

Already an evergreen that deserves to be listed here. It still is a diverse game, not too difficult in comparison to some newer games but one that still keeps up with the new generation. Puerto Rico is a varied game with different winning techniques and strategies.

The only drawback is the outdated design of the board and buildings. A classic game which must be present in every gamer's collection.

Boring theme, and bland art.

It's an efficiency machine.  The little bit of player interaction it has causes seating position to be a really import part of the game.

RATING: 10
After many plays in real life and possibly hundreds online or against an AI, I've still never grown tired of PR. A great game. Tough if the players aren't fairly balanced in skill, as a newbie's actions can mess things up for players who know what they're doing, but I've found a little strategy coaching often helps.

RATING: 3
After first play i was second ,my  friend told me it's normal for a new player,one of the worst game i ever play , i really don't like.the luck depend on which place you are sitting. I won one game with out doing anything except producing goods, and selling to make money and sending it on boat this gave me a lot of buildings and victory pts at the end, and i don't know how , just won't play it any more, bad game for me. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Without a doubt the best game of my collection. Lots of possibilities and tactics. The fact that others can benefit from your character selection is similar to the dice roll in Settlers. But here it's your choice what to pick.
Rush to the store if you don't have it yet (and you are into euro games. Otherwise don't bother)
UPDATE: After playing this game with some less experienced players, the mentioned flaw that the player sitting to the left of the least experienced player has an advantage, become to clear to remain unnoticed. Therefore, I had to lower the rating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A decent fun game, but I fail to see how this is always in the #1 and #2 on BGG. 
It was a pain for everybody to try and read those little tiles during the game, it was difficult to teach (and we already know how to play similar games like San Juan and Race for the Galaxy.)
I'm already bored with the limited choices with the buildings (and they are visually dull as well), the game starts way to slow and takes way too long to finish. If you have a player that doesn't pay attention to what they are doing then they tend to give the game away to other players, it is great when they sit to the right of you though. That is a lot of flaws for a game to be #1.

RATING: 7.9
Puerto Rico is a great game, though it can often feel like a math problem.  The game is quite tight and small choices have huge repercussions across the table.  At times, other players' actions have such a tremendous impact on your own position that the game can feel random and swingy (until you all understand the ramifications of your actions, in which case it feels kind of scripted).

I understand why this is (was?) the highest rated game on BGG.  It is a great game that helped me rediscover gaming.

Still, I think that every gamer should play this at least once.

Are you ever mildly disappointed after watching a movie that everyone else says is a "must see"?  Even though the movie was "good", your expectations were so high that nothing short of perfection will do.  Such was the case when I played Puerto Rico.  The game was fun but perhaps not as earthshaking as I was expecting.  I still rate it a '9' because it is a well designed, fun game; but I fully expected it to be a '10'.   Maybe it will be after the hype dies down and I can judge the game on its own merits.

While I respect Puerto Rico's great design, a session of it with similarly skilled gamers is a bit dull because most of the opening and closing moves have become too predictable. I just don't feel strongly motivated to put this one on the table, especially considering the setup and breakdown time, which is reflected in my current score. I'd still recommend that anyone who has yet to play it should at least try it a couple of times. I think I'd only be interested in playing PR a few times a year at most. I think a lot more BGGers should revisit their rating scores for this game and base it on whether they still have the same passion for PR.

A true board gaming classic. This is a grandfather of modern board gaming and I think it still holds up well over most newer games. It's great, tight, and deeply strategic.

PR is a great game, but it is slowly decaying in my scale of interest... too many plays have killed the variety of the game, expecially when the people have all started a "do or die" mentality about how this game has to be played.

There's a reason this game is so popular and highly rated. It's an amazing game. It is relatively easy to learn for those familiar with the euro games genre. The role selection is a fun mechanic and a nice change from the similar worker placement style. It is the kind of game you immediately want to play again after finishing it to see what decisions could be improved in the next game.

This game has a very vintage feel to it, but I don't think anything has come along that quite replaces it. Puerto Rico is a solid Euro that would be easy to pick up if it wasn't for all the buildings. I think it might be a little too open-ended and loose with how long it goes by today's standards, but I can see how this game has garnered as much support as it has over the years.

I prefer this to San Juan.

Well, where to start the #1 game here on BBG.  High replay factor.  I like the idea everyone has there own plantation (game board) and you use the central board as a stockpile/marketplace to acquire buildings & factorys for your own plantation.  Different than anything I've played, and I hit with my gaming group.  Glad to have this in my collection.

RATING: 7
This game is about building a prosperous colony by selecting the right action at the right time. Initially I liked the idea that your actions give both you and your opponents advantages and thus require you to carefully choose your strategy. However, the more I played, the more I began to feel that nothing new happened, particularly in the end-game where the choices are limited. I also felt a lack of control as most actions you take in the game are actually chosen by another player.

Pros: Chance plays little part, all players participate to the end, short game sessions
Cons: Little player interaction, little variation, little control, difficult to get back from bad start

This is a solid game that hasn't outworn it's welcome addition to a collection. I feel it's better overall than Race for the Galaxy (it's spiritual successor) failing in only how many little bits and bobs there are.

Do yourself a favor, upgrade at least this game's packaging to hold the components.

Also, it's a little bit racist. But then, they are just bits of wood representing people anyway.

This is a good game with good theme.  I'm seeing it as an excersise in futility lately.  It's all about groupthink, and all the groups now think the same.

Great! Exceptionally well balanced, gameplay is never the same from one game to another. One game doesn't take more than one hour if everyone knows it, which is uncommon for games of this type! Bought it 4 yrs ago but never played it until now and I cannot help but wondering how the h* we didn't! Only drawback so far is that it may turn out in the end that one player seems to be winning if he/she manage to finish off all available colonists, which makes for some strangely abstract strategies.

Have played it nearly 175+ times and to tell you the truth, I am tiring some of the game.  The new "Nobles" expansion in the Treasure Box, helps inject some freshness, but still not up to par with other stronger more recent titles, such as Macao, Brass and Egizia.....neat storyline in the farmer/trader/builder idea and terrific mechanics...even non-serious gamers enjoy this as I've taught over 20 people to play now

Puerto Rico is one of the pinnacles of game design.  It has just about everything that I look for in a game: multiple viable strategies for victory, deep gameplay, interesting tactical decisions, and good player interaction.  For a long time, this was my #1 game, and for good reason.  I've probably played over 50 times face to face, and it took me many plays to become comfortable.  The reason Puerto Rico is no longer my #1 game is that it needs to be played by players of equal skill level.  Because I've had several play groups recently and I have taught this game to several new people, I no longer have opponents with the same experience as I do, and as a result, I find myself winning more often than normally.  As a result, in my latest games I've sort of played on auto-pilot and still won.  This is still a great game and a fantastic design, but I now find myself leaning towards other games.  On a side note, I find that Puerto Rico is actually a very good next step game after I teach people Settlers or Carcassonne or Acquire.

Not Bad. The great Puerto Rico is on top of BGG ranking. I think this game is just fine. I've lost my respect for this game when, after playing with some new gamers, one of them called it "Monopoly without dice" . Most of the time, I'm just not in the mood to play this game, but I don't give it a lower rating because it deserves some respect for being BGG #1 :D

RATING: 8.5
Overall comment: An excellent game for 4 or more players.  It is not too heavy and involves many simple value based decisions.

Ratings:
Initial(wow factor): 9 (all components are interesting and have a good feel to them)
Family: 8 (sometimes requested)
Game Group: 7 (marginal - too simple, no tough decisions)
AP: 9 (little down time)
Solo play: 9 (#3 solo play - raised the overall rating of the game)

Purchased: 2006
Luck factor (1-10high): 2 (only in flipping the plantations)
Recommend expansions: Yes (for variety in the buildings)
Age range: 8+

Reason purchased: Geek reviews and game shop conversation

Pros: plays quick with little down time and little A/P, expansion makes it more varied and less programmed.  Solo and 2 player variants have significantly added to the replayability which has increased the play requests.
Cons: not as interesting with fewer players

Recommendation: Worthy purchase
Replay rating: Moderate
Game value(plays to game cost) : High

This game took me away from the Setllers of Catan.
The first play (Winter 2013/2014) was difficult as the game has more rules as compared to the Settlers of Catan. After 2-3 plays with 4p,I was heavily impressed by its gameplay and realized that I found my new hobby. After learning that Puerto Rico was first published in 2002, I was extremely thrilled and couldn't wait to learn about other board games that have been developed since then. This game was a definite 10 for me (in Spring 2014). It has become a 9 after I was introduced to Agricola.

Great game, it's not too difficult to play but is a bit harder to get new people to play.  The game seems to end right as things are getting going, but I guess that's a good thing because at that point you no longer feel restricted by your resources and the game would just get away from you.

Really elegant design where every decision feels important. Feels like it could come out today and still be among the best games of the year.

I played this with people who have played this alot. It was a 5 player game.

WAIT FOR NEW EDITION JUST LIKE WAIT FOR IMPERIAL SETTLERS UPDATED ERRATA EDITIONS ARE MARKED.

Talk about elegant. How crap. After a few plays, I realize how great this game is. Its simple game play followed by a great deal of nuance. The setup is annoying, and I suspect it will grow a bit stale without expansion buildings, but otherwise, I think I would usually be up for playing this game. 

Plays: 5+

Edit: will wait for an edition with expansions included though, but would like to get this some day as its the best role selection and good strategy game where I dont feel downtime very much, even in 5p. One caveat is you must play with experienced players (or maybe create some handicap for yourself) because the skill gap here can be significant.

Bewildered by the fact that I have played this as few times as I have, I have to blame the fact that I have no sentimental attachment (as it took some time into my gaming bio before I first tried it). It has not knocked me out of my socks, but I do feel I haven't given it the chance it deserves and I do intend to purchase it very soon (and then its rating will probably rise with more play). It's still the best in it's genre of resource building and balancing (little/no luck, multiple paths to victory, fairly quick, not hard to grasp, medium/low fun factor) but there are so many games of this sort that I'm getting a little fed up with the wboth mechanics and theme.

I really wanted to like this game. Played it several times and what my rating really boils down to is that this game is just not fun.

The choices to be made are not interesting in any way. There may be some interesting mechanics in the game, but for me this does not translate into a fun game.

I truly believe this is a highly over-rated game. I can kinda understand some people enjoying this game, but the rating does not seem to fit the amount of enjoyment provided by this game.

This game fully deserves most of the praise that has been lavished upon it.  My only gripe...and it isn't as major as it used to be...is that the large buildings are a little too powerful.  If you're the only player who doesn't get one, then you are, in all likelihood, screwed.

Puerto Rico is like a swiss clock. The gameplay is very fluent, brings interactions between players. All is question of strategies and tactics. If you want to win, you must choose your role at the good moment. You have to watch the situation of other players and adapt your strategie. It's always a pleasure to play this game. I recommend it for 3 to 4 players. With two players, it can be like chess. With five players, the game is too long for me but very interesting.

The sign of a great game - the more I play, the more I like it. This one seems to appeal to all kinds of gamers, too - many in my group favor lighter fare, while I prefer the deeper and more complex games, yet we all agree on this one. The funny thing about it is that, at first, I considered this a heavy game, but now consider it light-medium game, leaning more towards light! Puerto Rico as filler - who woulda thunk it?

RATING: 9
After dozens of playings I've hit a wall of reduced interest in the game, reducing it's rating from 10 to 9.  The wall comes in the form of the game taking on a more chess-like (and for me, less interesting) nature of openings now that the feeling out process has more or less ended.  It remains a favorite, even with it's initial momentum having worn off, and is still an excellent way to spend an hour.

Bought this game because it was number one here on boardgamegeek, and I wasn't disappointed. There are so many decisions to make over the course of the game, that it is difficult to predict who is going to win.

This is a very good game, which is full of strategy and deserves the #1 spot.

EDIT: November 11th

I have decided to lower my rating for this game from 10 to 9. There is lots of strategy, but it is really just the same game every time, and it can easily get boring when played repeatedly.

Febuary 24th, 2007:
Lowered from 9 to 8.5. I really don't find myself wanting to play this that much anymore.

Upped to 7 after a really good game. I think it might climb higher.

In a good wargame you win by using common-sense historical strategies; in an auction game you win by analyzing the value of the auction; by contrast in  Puerto Rico you mostly need to play it a lot.

Pretty much played-out after 10 plays.  Seating order is WAY too important and has soured most of the people I play with (at least a bit). The fact that the big National and International 4-player games (which I play the most) run about:
first seat:25%
second seat: 16%
third seat: 33%
fourth seat: 26%
Indicates to me that there's a real problem with the game.
Once my group got to the point where everyone was playing at about the same skill level, our stats more or less fell into line with those above.
***
Played again.  Third player won again.  Dropped rating from 8 to 7.
Rapidly losing interest in this game.

Played a couple more times.  Third player won both times.  Dropped rating from 7 to 4 as I'm unlikely to play this game again unless coerced.  Too bad.  I really enjoyed it when I was first introduced.

Puerto Rico is a fantastic strategy game that has an unfortunately high barrier to entry.  First time players are overwhelmed with the number of options that veteran players are comfortable with.  If you can find a player willing to invest in learning the game, it can be great fun.  Players select roles on each turn, and all players get to take advantage of the role while the player selecting it gets a special privilege for the role.  You must constantly evaluate whether it is better to help yourself or harm your opponents, as doing both is rarely possible.

I won my very first game of Puerto Rico against other veterans!  I had a great time playing Puerto Rico.  The whole design is very interesting and enjoyable.  Every round each player takes his turn selecting a role card and performing their action.  After selecting a role each player after gets to do the same action, although a bit diluted.  During the course of the game you want to sell goods and buy new buildings so that you have the most points at the end.

Great game.  I remember reading someone describing that although Agricola and Puerto Rico are both great games, Puerto Rico manages to do it with more finesse and less stress.  I agree, although sometimes I like to feel the stress of Agricola!

A wonderful game that has somehow taken on a chess-like quality, where it isn't enjoyable unless you're playing with opponents of similar expertise. Perhaps because the randomization factor is low. I want to give it a higher rating because of what a great game it is, but playing it nowadays feels like following a script, certainly for the first few rounds.

I need to play this one again and remember how it felt.  It's a nostalgia game for me right now, and that's not fair.  But my gut tells me the following: There's been better games that scratch the same itch since its release, while its mechanics were groundbreaking at the time they fail to create the same feelings now, and the game is too dependent upon all players being at the same skill level.

Still, with the right group of players, it's fun enough.  I'm just not clamoring to play it.

Mais um jogo que não me chamou atenção na primeira partida, mas depois foi crescendo no conceito. Hoje, tá na lista dos favoritos. Puerto Rico é simples, relativamente rápido e divertido. A ideia é colonizar a ilha, dividida em plantations (de café, milho, tabaco, açúcar, anis) e prédios urbanos, incluindo manufaturas, hotéis e outros. A cada rodada, todos os jogadores escolhem funções que serão realizadas por todos, mas com bônus pra quem escolheu. Vence quem tiver mais pontos de vitória, conseguidos principalmente com exportações.

If you like long-ranging strategy, then you'll like this one. You can plan just about your entire game from the beginning. Which is also it's downside - there's so little luck that there's little room for flexibility. You're better off finding a good early-game strategy and sticking to it the entire time. Also, pretty much the only player interaction is griefing, which sometimes works out great but here feels kind of spiteful.

My Number 1 game of all times, a must play for every eurogamer out there. For non-gamers, give them a slab of any of the available party/gateway games and then give them a portion of puerto rico. If that person is a boardgamer, he/she will enjoy puerto rico, if he/she does not enjoy the experience, he/she is more likely a non-gamer at heart.

Qualms: Tends to be a tad too repetitive at times due to the very small random elements that are available in the game. IMO, this cannot be solve as the lack of randomness in the game may in fact be the reason why it is so great.

The quintessential Euro cube-pusher. On my first play it felt somewhat dry, but kept sucking me back in. Lots of subtle strategies and opportunities for blocking.

A good game, playing with new people can actually be good since you have to deal with unexpected actions. Still a good game for new people since the game play is fairly straight forward.

A wonderful game -- I'm almost always up for a game of Puerto Rico.  Close to being ranked a 10, but the order of play is too large a factor in this game: a weak player to your right can make mistakes in your favor; an experienced (and/or vicious) player to your right can be devastating.  While the game has a bit of a learning curve, most people catch on to the flow  of events by the second or third game.  One of those rare games that I tend to enjoy even if I'm not doing particularly well :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Players spending round after round choosing a character each to carry out actions for them was already a known mechanism when Puerto Rico arrived, having been used in several popular games; though, it had never before been the motor of such a complex creature, where players had to get an island's economy to move balancing several variables (crops give money and victory points, money buys buildings, buildings improve crops and yield victory points).

This quantum leap is due to a little twist/stroke of genius: one player chooses a role to act FOR ALL PLAYERS, getting a benefit from being first (this benefit would depend on the chosen role). This enables both the possibility for each player to carry out unique and ambitious plans in each round and to keep everyone constantly busy, as one role has to be played by all before the next role is able to start. Players don't stay close for too long, either: the changing available plantations and an impressive array of buildings offer a myriad of ways to follow.

This is arguably one of the very best German games ever released - it's difficult to find a game based almost exclusively on tactics that is as rich as Puerto Rico. The real surprise, though, is that when actually comparing it to the other "complex" classics (from El Grande to Le Havre, you could say) the striking simplicity of its core lies bare for all to see.

Evergreen. Gioco perfetto. Numerose sono le opzioni per fare punti vittoria, interazione tra giocatori enorme, assenza di fortuna, pianificazione a lungo termine indispensabile ma non semplice da attuare. Insomma un gioco con infiniti aspetti di mio gradimento e dalla durata contenuta. Trovo come unico difetto il fatto che sedere a sinistra di un giocatore esordiente o meno bravo possa portare sensibili vantaggi. Il gioco solitamente non piace a chi predilige giochi semplici e veloci anche se regolamento e meccaniche non sono complesse. La definizione perfetta è in 4 giocatori, ok anche in 5, meno bello secondo me in 3. Consigliatissimo.

The really remarkable thing about this complex game is the sheer intuitiveness to it. There's very little a good gamer can't pick up instantly, and a competent gamer within a few turns, even if the strategy requires constant honing. The sell-for-money or ship-for-VPs decision is delightfully agonising and the role selection mechanic may never be bettered. Is it a problem that the components aren't really the best and that the seating order might just be the be-all and end-all?

A bit more fiddly than I had imagined, with some rules that are not exactly as written on the buildings, etc. I think with a few plays it would get better though.

I really like the mechanism of this game; you don't actively oppose other players, but your choice of role each round does impact heavily on them indirectly, so compared to some German-style games you are encouraged to watch your opponents and factor their aims into your strategy. 

I also really like the counters, which you can imagine as being like barrels - something that adds theme to the game, which is a strong point, as the game mechanics fit well with its theme, as you can imagine that you are developing your colony and exporting goods to the old country.

My wife's favorite game.   Very fun to play (until my children start getting bored with it).  My children (12 and 13) get bored because of the downtime within the turns.  My son tolerates the game, but my daughter despises it.  I've actually bored of the game myself.

Only started recording plays in 2014, but picked this up back when it first game out and it was one of the first games after learning Catan (my first Euro) that threw me into deeper more heavier (medium at least!) games.  Love it.  Classic.  Will never get rid of this one!

I can only join the praising of this fine game. The games mechanism is simply absorbing. One concern I have though is that in the last turns of the game the choice of plantation tiles are, except maybe for corn, irrelevant. The need for refineries and colonists to man them, makes e.g. a coffee-coffee-sugar combination near impossible before game over. Thus limiting choices. Still my 10-rating stands, cause I´ll come back and play again & again. Credits to the FREE expansion too.

Like the choices involved in the game.  One downside is the play of the person next to you can affect your game.  If we play more than 1 round of this we change seats.

Great game, but you need to play with people who know how to play, or you'll crush them. The problem is that the buildings are the same in every game, so you'll tend to play automatically. It would be great to have an expansion with more buildings, to randomize them.

A true 10. The game is pure strategy, no luck included. It is not only about making a good strategy, but also requires you to be able to react to the other players' strategies and tweak the situation to your own advantage. It's not an overly long game, but manages to be great fun while it lasts.

The game mechanics are easy to understand and you start playing right away. 2-player rules work fine as well.

If you're only getting one game, this should be it!

Today we had our first go at Thebes and while the element of luck was negatively commented upon, we still want to play another game, but Puerto never gets another chance... It must be that this game (splendid as it might be for some ppl)  feels very dry for my group(s).

Even if there is already immense accolades for this game, I must add my own. It's a great game. What I really like about the game, is its many possibilities on how to play for victory. The variations are also good for many replays of the game. The other thing I really like is the constant interaction. Even when its not your turn, you almost always get to do things anyway. The strategies are subtle, but they are there. F.e. in the last game when I went for maximises income from trading, the other player could stop me by either trading the goods I had before it was my turn, or by using shipping and forcing me to ship the few expensive goods I had. Somewhat more dependent on what the others do than you'd want, i.e. even if you are a good experienced player, its hard to win if the Role selections of others goes against you.

This is the game that introduced me to euros.  It also the game that re-ignited my interest in board games.  A couple of years ago I would've rated this game a 9 or 10.  But I found that you can play this game online.  So after 200+ games of PR online, I discovered a couple of things: because so many of the housekeeping duties are automated online, when switching back to the cardboard version, it becomes almost excrusiatingly slow; and the face to face interactions with friends over a board game is at least half the fun.  As a result of playing PR online, I never want to play a board game that I enjoy online again.

Only tried with 2 players, otherwise my rating would probably be a 7. Rating 6 as I think the game is ranked too high on BGG and I also dont like the solitaire feeling of playing the game, would be better if all players were building the same town and building of other players actually mattered to opponents. In other words: too gamey kind of game for me.

Really a terrific game. Empire building is so much fun. And the dice can't hate me from here. People accuse this of being boring. Maybe because there is only a few valid strategies to win.

Low randomness but hard to predict. The key allure is having the feeling of being able to make pivotal choices that affect the course of play. Would like to play it more often, but it can sometimes be a bit too much for some of my regular game playing group. The lack of playability at two players is a problem as well, though the fact that it remains in my collection and highly rated despite this is telling based on my gaming habits.

So we played it a few times; the wins were spread fairly evenly amongst the players, but none of us were entirely sure why we won or lost (and to be honest, none of us really cared).

Probably best compared with fine wines - there are people out there who enjoy discussing the subtle differences, wafting the whiff, sipping the stuff, taking their time and whatnot, but it's dry, fusty, musty and dull. Drunk on fun playing Puerto Rico we were not...

Such a great game, perfect, and it has a smooth flow of game play! It seems in every game someone wins with some new and unexpected strategy...and that proves there are many ways to win! Simple to learn and relearn the rules...pull it out of the box and play! To us, it is a clever and more refined strategical game than Agricola. And when you play with the expansion the replay ability of the game is enhanced! But Agricola offers a better option for families, replay ability, 2-player games and solo games!

An excellent game! Just reading the rules makes the game seem a lot more complex than how the game actually plays. Turns, actions, et al move along very smoothly. The bits and pieces are of very good quality. Instructions and player guides are on almost every piece in one fashion or another. There is a typo on the player boards ... the builder action states "The mayor" when it should say "The builder".   We played with five and had a lotta fun. If you can gain a "monopoly" of one of the items being produced, you have a very good chance of winning the most victory points. Well worth the price of admission.

One of the first board games I played after a long hiatus and still one of my favourites.

RATING: 10
It's overated- it's a good game, but I don't understand why it's number one. Too much setup time, small fiddly bits, not quite enough interaction (i.e. no central map to compete for space on), weak theme, "buildings" components are poor- no artwork, doesn't scale well, steep learning curve, everyone needs to be the same skill level, etc, etc. 
You see- lots of little things niggle me with this game. 

EDIT (12 April 07)- I've upped this from an 8 to a 9 (I think I first rated it either a 7 or a 7.5) The more I play it the more I like it! This is rather odd, because I didn't like it that much until I had played about 15 odd games or so, but one day I found myself thinking about it quite hard, and all of a sudden I found that I really like this game!

I think this is something to do with familiarity- I hate having to teach this game (because there's a lot to explain and there is the new/weak player craftsman issue), but *I* still want to play it under the right condidtions (i.e. with other players who are already familiar with the game). Just typing this I'm busy contemplating some new tactics hehehe... :)

What do you know, I've rated this a 10 (Dec 2007)

Good game, but not sure if it will ever be my favorite. Friends not into boardgaming didn't like it (concept of gameplay too vague for them). After another play I downgraded it. There are just a few weird rules (like losing inventory when you can't ship, or the obligation to fill up a ship even when you were planning to sell your cubes to the market) that don't make playing it a superb experience. Also quite solitary.

Along with Citadels, I was told Puerto Rico was "one of the best role-selection Euros." While only having played Puerto Rico, I can say role selection is a great mechanic to eliminate people feeling bored during the game. The game is fun, thoroughly engaging (even when it's not my turn) and always a pleasure to play. I have nothing negative to say about Puerto Rico. Except maybe the subtle racism. C,mon, really? "Colonists"? Please.

One can easily understand why this is (or at least was) the #1 game in BGG after playing it just once. Game components are excellent (the little barrels really hit my taste), and plays fast. The "choose your role" mechanic is the best i've seen so far in a game.

Superb design. A pleasure to play again and again, trying different approaches to win. It's amazing when you finally find how to use that building that you used to despise. Don't listen to the people that think you can force a win with some specific strategy: not always the elements are at your disposal for this. Sometimes you simply cannot pick all the corns you perhaps want for the "corn strategy", for example.

One of our top 10 games. Plant + build + harvest + manage = all in one. Lots of interaction. The biggest advantage for me is that you see who is leading, you can react, but keep in mind tha your actions are affecting your oponents.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Just a classic.

The mechanics are plain fun to play and there is a lot to do, so you have to find the perfect time for slotting each thing you want to do without helping too much your opponents. 
The perfect game for trying to leech your opponents efforts!

Due to this, this game suffers a lot when experienced players are faced with newbies, as they can help more an opponent than themselves.

RATING: 10
50+ plays. A great game that's provided enough variety to stand the test of time. It's about the constant need to assess the intentions of the other players, both short and long term, and set yourself up so you can take continual advantage of their moves and not be left out. Securing income is the initial goal, and then buying combinations of buildings that work well together will define your VP strategy. Whilst being on constant alert for short term tactical opportunities. I have the expansion and we'll occasionally pull it out for variety, but most times we're still happy playing the base game. Which is a testament to its durability.

Classic euro game where you take the role as a producer & exporter of goods. It's got a very interesting role choice mechanic and is a very clever game that will appeal to true gamers (I think they like the control and eliminate the luck factor). I just like the fact that the choices in front of you seem simple but the impact of which can be deep. Just a great game and a BBG fav which I can see why.

It can be said that this is Race For The Galaxy: The Board Game, sort of.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
What I like:
- Interesting without being too heavy
- Multiple strategies, apparently
- Reasonable length (75-90 minutes with 4p)

What I don't like:
- Feels like a needlessly-bloated San Juan
- Too many ways to get unintentionally screwed
- Can feel like a game of "chicken" because your best move can set someone else up for better
- If you really think about it, it's really clear that the colonists are slaves

Where SJ is all about leaching, PR almost feels like it is all about preventing successful leaching. I don't like either approach, but dislike the SJ way less. SJ feels like a far more refined design. PR 2p variant sounds awkward.

It's a classic, and I can see why it was popular when it came out. Like Settlers (but less so), it no longer stands out as a top-notch game. The 3.3 weight seems reasonable--probably 3.0 rules complexity and 3.5 depth.

Rating dropped from 6 to 5 after a second play. Could drop further.

RATING: 7
A well thought out game, but new players are really at a disadvantage.  New players need to get a copy of the rules to read a week ahead of time, just to keep things straight, otherwise they will be crushed by experienced players.

RATING: 8.5
As brilliant as ever. Great system. Everything is related in this game, and picking a role will have other players do the same thing. So one of the interesting mechanics of the game is to chose when's the best moment to chose a specific role, trying to minimize other players benefit from it. Loads to think about, much management... very good game indeed!

I liked this game better before, but the more you play the more it's the same few strategies that win, and if you fail to get the right buildings before your opponents take them you lose. It's not even a matter of your skill, but who's the starting player, and in what order you sit. 

Every time I play this (which probably is once every two years) I have to lower my rating.

Although there is a lot more to the game and a lot more constraints, I don’t want to get into each one. But if you like a lot of management and quick thinking, this is a must. I cannot say that any two games have been the same and with all my play, I would still play every week. This is not a light game by any means, however it lasts approximately one to two hours and can be played by two to five players (the two player game requires a variant).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Based on one play.  Found it to be deep, but not hard to understand.  We were comfortable with the rules and flow of play within a couple rounds.  I love how everyone is involved throughout the game.  I was worried that due to the theme, I may have found it to be dry.  But it turned out to not be the case.  Everyone enjoyed the entire two hours it took to play and we all agreed we want to play it again.  I can see how many became quite addicted to this game.

One minor negative though:  This game has A LOT of set up and take down time, even if you keep all the stuff organized.

UPDATE:  Played several times now (I dont log every play).  The game deserves its high ramking.

ANOTHER UPDATE:  I am moving this down to a 9 from its previous perch at 10.  It is still a classic and always will be.  But I find that at times play gets scripted.  Also, in a 4 or 5 player game, you will at times feel like the outcome is beyond your control and there is little to nothing you can do to improve your position.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
At first, the pressure of having to choose a role every turn made me anxious and I did not enjoy playing this, but after playing it two-player several times and getting used to the strategy, I feel much more confident now.   I wish the little colonist pieces were a little larger because they are difficult to pick up and tend to scatter.

RATING: 7
The game does get a bit formulaic as you play more, it is hard to find the opportunity or justification in trying a new strategy once you learn one that works against your group. The only down side is introducing it to newbies. I have yet to find a new player who has a chance against an opponent who has played it at least once. There is not enough time to make up for bad plays at the beginning. Another issue with new players is helping understand that Money is not the object, a paradigm shift from regular life.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Any game that has arguments over who has to sit next to the newbie/bad player because it affects their game is not a good game. Tired of post-game discussions that invariably sound like "you only won because Player X mad Obvious Bad Move Y." You hear that in any game but games of PR overflow with these discussions.

Great strategy game!  The rules can be somewhat overwhelming to gamers who like simple rules; but after a few turns, you begin to pick up the rhythm of the gameplay.  It's not a "ha ha" fun game, but it is a thinking, plotting fun game.  Very robust and meaty.  I definitely want to play this again.

Qui è stato l'incontrastato numero 1 da anni. Non posso che essere d'accordo: un gioco fantastico nella sua semplicità e appassionante per l'interazione tra i giocatori.

Puerto Rico is very cool, but I can't help but compare it to Goa, and Princes of Florence.  Both of those are better.  The trouble is that Puerto Rico lacks auctions. The role-choosing phase is no compensation.  There is far less tension or interaction. It does have subtlety, and its interesting.

Despite not being on the strategic level of the BSW addicts, I do enjoy Puerto Rico a lot.  The role selection mechanic really keeps everyone involved, and the buildings provide a huge amount of strategic depth.  I'm constantly amazed at the interconnectedness of every single thing that each player does in this game.  I really wish the game were easier to set up, though.

An excellent game.  The strategy is strange, as it is not to choose the move that gains you the most, rather to choose the move than gains you the most relative to the other players.

RATING: 10
Beautiful, elegant. Almost perfect. It is the kind of game you always wanted to make, and play. Not for the immature gamer, as it is easy to make a bad play at just about any point in the session, and play king-maker. (Be patient with newbies) This game will be in my collection for as long as I game. I bought 2 extra copies because I will wear them all out over the next 20 years.

Oct 2014: I think I wrote the above words shortly after I joined BGG in the early 2000's. Since then, against my prediction, I've given away my extra copies, and my regular copy of the game, and did not wear them out. I did buy a sealed Anniversary Edition that I may break out some day. The people I play this with have copies, so I usually play theirs. Although not in my recorded plays, I have played PR easily more than 30 times face-to-face, and another 50 or so on the iOS App, the "PR Evolver" excel spreadsheet, or on Brett Spiel Welt. That's a pretty solid exploration of the game, but still far from what I anticipated, particularly in the face-to-face arena, particularly after 2005.

What happend that threw off my optimistic prediction of PR plays was probably 3 things: the incredible general expansion of the boardgame hobby, the evolution from German -> Euro ->  "hybrid" games, and the rise of the Tablet. (Ok, a fourth might be the arrival of Caylus - which I hate - and it's ilk, like Agricola - which I like very much).

(In 2014, it's rare but a real hobby grognard (like Mark Johnson of "Board Games to Go" fame) who can somewhat inteligibly define what a "German" game is anymore. I'm not going to bother. But suffice to say that game design and development has immensely benefited from general improvements in the internet (speed primarily), and social media. This led to the migration away from more theoretical "hard-core" games like PR, Tigris and Euphrates, and even El Grande.)

Anyway - more stuff has come out. Like everything else in the world today, the boardgame hobby has become fractionalized and turned into a multitude of niche interests.

I still love the game.

First play had no clue what anyone was doing. Second play had about two-thirds of a clue what I was doing. At that point, it's easy to see how every turn you have a decision to make that affects both the near future and your long-term strategy.

When I first purchased this game many years ago I really enjoyed it. After 5-10 games it's appeal quickly wore off. 

Experienced players will predict multiple turns in advanced as they wait for their own. It plays out almost mathematically. Those who need creative strategy should look elsewhere. The game is poorly balanced, throw one lesser experienced player into the mix and the person next in the cycle has a very strong advantage. 

The game has a slickness to it - little room for confusion once you know how to play. It kind of a reliable little game that will play as expected, but its not going to give you the 'WOW' moments that such a high rated game may lead you to believe. 

If you are a collector this is one to have on the shelf, but if you have $50 to buy just one good strategy game I would pass.

Pros:
+Great gateway game once players have gotten into boardgames a bit more. This one brings a lot more depth without being too overwhelming.
+Interesting theme
+Game flows pretty smoothly, multiple ways to kill the game.
+A lot of depth and strategy.
+Extra "colonists" in case you lose them.

Cons:
-Pieces are so-so quality. The wood components are nice, but the cardboard is not that great.
-The colonists are very small. They have the potential to get lost easily.
-Theme is too dry for some people.
-Game is vastly different than what most people are used to, can be a bit much at the beginning until after a few rounds.

A great strategy game. You begin with a fistful of doubloons and a plantation, with a goal to benefit more from each role than your opponents. This game has much double-thinking, predicting "what my opponents will take next" and always keeps in you "in", as you play in every turn. Despite its static setup, each game turns out to be different and has room for a lot of strategies.

OWN Jan/04: Beautiful, well-balanced planning game, which plays best with 3-4 experienced people (5 is good too, but plays differently, and feels WAY more vicious).  Definite choices available for picking the highest-reward highest-screw-your-neighbours role per round, not necessarily just whatever's best for you.

But for casual gamers, or those that don't game together frequently, I feel that Puerto Rico would not be a good choice.  Too many building functions to learn; experience is just too valuable to allow newbies any chance to beat those that know the game.

RATING: 10
This game is just brilliant. It is very well balanced and there are plenty of ways to win.

February 2011: I haven't been playing this much lately, but every time I do I wonder why this doesn't hit the table more often. One of the reasons I like this game is that it is very delicately balanced and there are many evenly strong strategies. In order to win with more experienced players you have to constantly think at least one turn ahead. However, even this clearly is a complex game, the rules are surprisingly simple and easy to learn.

One of the most fascinating and balanced game designs I've played. It takes a play or two to be really competitive against but the ebb-and-flow and reading what everyone else is going to be doing adds a lot of interaction to a game that on the outside might look like a multiplayer solitaire euro.

Isn't it a little bit overrated?? Was it really necessary to make dozens of different palaces without any drawing to help you? Add to this many possible roles you can personify making different actions, and you'll pass your first 5 games only reading the rules. The games works very well, there's no doubt, but play it only if you want to invest a lot of time on it, otherwise go for games with fewer elements.

Not so bad, after all.

Er... this game is definitely great!! I don't know how to explain the feeling of creating and build that it gives to you, the impression that it's never clear what action to follow and consequences are always very complex. But beware, my rating went up from 7 to 8.5 only when I could spend 2-3 whole evenings studying the rules and attaching translated Italian palaces (thanks to the bgg'er that did them!).

Used to play it with the wrong rules and it's much better with the right ones. :) 

There's a really good mix between tactics and strategy. You need to know where you want to go, but the tactical play each turn is where the game is played. Players' actions have a significant impact in everyone else's game. The base game is extremely balanced and it shows that a lot of work was made during development and playtesting. 

After more than 50 games played, none of the charm is lost. Wonderful game!

It simply doesn't get any better than this.  Puerto Rico is basically a pure-strategy game.  Luck?  Fahgeddaboutit.  This is a HARD game to learn and I honestly don't know if it's possible to master.  I think it fair to say that when it is your turn there's almost never a clear "correct" choice,  instead you always have to choose between 2 or 3 very good and justifiable options. It's not until later that you'll find out if you made the right choice.

Definitely one of my all time favorites.

Puerto Rico is still one of the best strategy and worker placement games I have seen to date. The length of each game (+/- 2 hrs) can put off a few people. Try getting people revved up with Catan before introducing them to this one. If you do not like Catan you should try PR before buying it.

8.5: I think this is a really good game. I'm kind of dissapointed with some of the buildings being inferior to others. It may be that I haven't just found the strategy where they are useful.

There's nearly no luck at all in Puerto Rico, and nearly limitless ways in which to achieve victory.  Game design is very good, components are nice, the box design is stellar.  Everyone does something on every turn (a game mechanic we're seeing more often; Age of Mythology, Twilight Imperium 3rd) so there's very little personal downtime, and even when there is you're trying to figure out your next move(s).

Few games are as balanced as Puerto Rico is.

Edit: Well, the time goes on and gaming experiences change. Compared to those other 10-rated games in my collection, this one qualifies to the topmost ratings no more. This doesn't mean, that the game is bad. It's still better than most games.

Subjective -0.5 Hit because the interaction is so indirect.  I need a bit more direct contact with opponents!

This game doesn't see as many plays as it should.  A bit dry for the persons I typically play with, unfortunately.  Otherwise the game is very solid, and stands on its own merits.  My complaint is that when all is said and done, there is a fairly steep strategic learning curve for new players.

Played this game a lot with a few friends before I discovered BGG. Recently have only played 2P, and enjoy it. The official 2P variant is pretty good, but I think I prefer to play where the governor gets 3 actions and the other player gets 2. This prevents one player getting 2 choices in a row and introduces just a bit more cash. Only a couple plays this way, though, so more experimentation is in order. I'm interested in the 3-spot trading post and 3 ship variants posted here.

01/11/12 - When I don't play Puerto Rico for a long time it gets into my head that the game is super fiddly and takes forever and that I'd rather be playing something more exciting. When I actually play I remember what a wonderful game this is and how it's full of meaningful choices and smooth worker placement mechanics. It's such a great game. (Rating: 8)

I played it again and it was just as good as the last time. Glad I have it.

10/21/12 - Again, it's been a long time since I've played it but it surprised me again. I really wish that they would re-theme it but keep it almost exactly the same. Puerto Rico is such a boring setting. I know there's Race for the Galaxy but it's not exactly the same. Maybe I'll re-theme and print and play it myself. (Rating: Upgraded to a 9)

Who can play? Strategy game for 3-5 players.

A strategy game where everyone does something on everyone's turn, so not a lot of waiting for things to happen.  Each turn someone chooses to take one of 7 unique roles, and each role can be chosen only once per turn - so the game flows very differently than other games.  Another of my many favorites.

Bought the iOS version on sale for 2.99 during March. Tried the tutorial and immediately can relate to San Juan the card game which I own. Was in a game but the app crashed. Will give it another try later.

---- Update ----
After two full games under my belt I can tell this is a good game, but it is not a game that I would want to play it all the time.

---- Update ----
Got this one sale for $21 during a B&N 50% off sale. Somehow the textile feeling of the actual game augmented my enjoyment compare to the iOS app, so rating goes from 7 -> 8.

Nearly never got to appreciate what a gem this is ... I purchased PR early on in my gaming infatuation (just after TTR - yes the #1 on BGG sucked me in !) but was set to trade it away in an Aussie math trade as each time I read the rules I could not get my head around it . Decided to get down and dirty with rules and give it a go before the trading deadline and after one play decided to hold onto it ..
Have since taught around 40 people to play - with almost unanimous success . I now wonder why I found it so hard to grasp the rules and gameplay when I see how well many others have picked it up . Will play this anytime and my admiration for it continues to build . Buy it !

RATING: 9
Fantastic game - many plays. One of my favorites. I can see owning and playing this game for the rest of my life. Are there some "strong" strategies? Yes. Does the game become a little scripted when you've played it many times? Perhaps. But Chess is a bit like that too. Patterns in this game are more in the form of strategies to counter the opponent. If an opponent leads in one area, you counter by playing in another area. If an opponent rushes the game by building quickly, you will likely enter that race to a full tableau, but the games can vary greatly in duration and strategy. Not so much "head to head" as "doing my own thing while keeping an eye on what my opponent is doing and reacting accordingly."

This is actually two games, one for the occasional player and one for the expert player.  I have enjoyed my 5 or 6 plays enough, enjoy the multiple types of game options, but have never understood why I did well or poorly.

RATING: 7
Yes, this game has very little luck in it, but it's there. I don't like complicated games in which turn order and role selection HEAVILY influence the game, because then the guy sitting to the right of you is having a massive impact on the game. I don't like being to the leftof another experienced player, who happens to have a newbie to the right of him. It wrecks the game that apparently has 'perfect' balance. In my book, anything that snags a 7 or higher is a fantastic game, and this is fantastic - but I've never seen a game so massively impacted by seating order. 

Yes, Race for the Galaxy can have situations where you unexpectedly play into an opponents hand, but PR can absolutely destroy you if an unfortunate sequence of roles are chosen. There's no contest of comparison, which is why RftG doesn't get dinged so much in this regard.

RATING: 10
Let me try to say something useful about this game:  it moves very quickly, with very little downtime.  Each decision is important, and good foresight is tremendously essential in order to win.  The same strategy will not work every game, and depending on your fellow players and seating order, you will need to adapt on the fly, usually changing or tweaking your chosen strategy.  Finally, experience results in more victories.  I have played far more than my friends, and tend to win about 75-80% of the time.  On a bad note, there can be a "bad choice effect" that helps one player more than the others, knocking one or more skilled players from contention strictly due to seating order.  When played among good players, though, it has few rivals, especially 3 or 4 player.

2014-09-18 --- Finally I have a chance to play my first game on it in a friend's gathering. His explanation on rules was clear and I found not difficult to learn it. (compared to Concordia and Clash to Cultures). Its mechanism of leader action and other players will follow is cool and a lot of other games seem copied it. It is a classic game that we all should own.

2013-12-17 --- Just bought it as got a 30% less discount. Heard that it is a heavy game. Still don't have time to open its box. :P

One of my favorite early Euro games!  I will always remember playing this with my brother and sister in Mexico, and a French man on vacation at the resort we were staying came to observe our game.  None of us knowing French, we eventually interpreted his words and gestures as him asking who won.  We pointed at my brother and he eyed James, then my little sister and I, snorted, pointed at James and said... "plus grande!" Haha!  

Anyways, I like it, I wish my siblings and I played it more.

i gotta say, after several years and real effort, i don't understand why it's rated as highly as it is.  maybe i'll come around some day, but i think it's counter-intuitive, clunky, and inelegant.  worst off, it's just not that much fun.

I've only played this a couple times. I enjoy it but for some reason I feel like I should enjoy it more than I do. I was ready to love this game and instead only like it. I think perhaps the need to always hose the neighbour to your left and the problems that arise when players fail to do so left me a little cool.

RATING: 9
Kingmaking, anyone?

Still, elegant and meaningfully simple. Can teach other players (in a brutal, "see-what-you-did" kind of way) how their moves can impact other people, one way or another.

My biggest gripe is the relative uselessness of a few of the buildings (University, Large Warehouse, etc). Still, though, pretty beastly pickup of a game. Playing with some of the buildings from the expansion definitely helps fix the "orphaned buildings" problem.

Very good game. 

The hype about it was a bit hysterical though. The game is deep, but isn't rocket science. If deepness makes you click on a geme try "Go" and get lost in deepness the Enterprise could not explore. Actually the original game became rather repetive quite soon, but fortunately the expansion buildings plus the aristocrats really patched that problem. 
So still a solid 8.

there are two problems with puerto rico.  the first is that it takes almost as long to set up as it takes to play.  secondly, it's really hard to find enough people who really understand the game.  there's almost always a guy who just doesn't understand the game very well, which offers a distinct advantage to the people to that person's left.

This is a clever economics game that is easy to learn, not too long and that offers diverse strategies. A well deserved top 10 to any collection. Maximizing what you can do on each turn is the crux of the game. Somewhat linear and medium lenght of time to set up all pieces. San Juan is a nice simplified version of this game that may more easily be played a couple of times in an evening.

Justifiably popular.  The greatest strength of PR to my mind is the almost complete elimination of the element of luck in the game; you have to rely on planning ahead, but at the same time being flexible enough to respond to changes resulting from the actions of other players.  Fairly quick to play, and always enjoyable (even though I seldom win!).

RATING: 9
For a change, this typical German-style game is not thin on theme, with a logical game flow and almost every building and role making sense. Only a few feel like add-ons to the game-mechanics (like the 25% VP bonus). The richness of options (incl. the variable phase order and the rearranging of colonists) offer variable paths to what can be a very close game.
There is only one thing missing for me to give it a 10: the fun factor that e.g. Cartagena or Intrigue have. Puerto Rico is more of a tense, serious affair.

I played this on the table a few times...  gave the computer version dozens of plays.  I tried to like this game.  Seems very tedious to me.  Multi-player  flowcharts with limited / obvious decision making with the exception of the building path which does not make up for the other problems. I traded my copy off.  Yawn.  Not fun at all.

The second game I played (with 3), I thought I was fighting it out with one of the other guys and it turned out that the guy who we all thought was trailing the whole way won with a last-minute cash infusion followed by a fortress.

I recently bought this game and am hoping to introduce it to the people we often play Settlers with. I very much like the feeling of setting up my own little factory and seeing it work. My wife and I have played a couple 2 player games and love the mechanics and the fact that we are faced with unsurmountable dilemmas on every move :). As good a strategy game I have played. The minor downside would be it tends to be a quiet thinking game, without much interaction between the players.

RATING: 1
A serious, nerdish game. Naturally, some combos are clearly a lot better than others, so the luck of the draw can be a big factor. Sadly it's another typical euro-trash game with a boring & soulless mechanic. BArey any player interractions which is quite sad for a boardgame when your suppose to interract with the other players, otherwise why are you into boardgame ? lol

The only interaction is in choosing roles, and if someone picks the one you wanted you'll have to completely re-think your selection. The whole thing is clunky, with a zero excitement level, and after your turn you can go read a book for a few minutes. Oh, yeah -- the game drags on far too long, and I pondered quitting after the first two hours. 

My second and third plays found me constantly thinking "When will it end, already!?" It was a complete pain to endure. I hope I never have to play again.

I know Puerto Rico (PR) is many people's favourite game. But though I find the mechanic for choosing actions an interesting one, the rest of the game just doesn't click for me. The game is about producing different types of goods and trading them for victory points. You do it by buying buildings and manning them with settlers. Despite there being five types of goods, they are all worth the same in VP terms. The good type is only important when selling a good for cash in the trade house (an action severly restricted throught the game) and determining how many units can be sold, as each ship can only carry one good type (go guess why...). Of course you can also buy buildings to "bend" the rules in your favour and to get extra VP, but, all in all, PR feels rather plain.

What can I say?  Its Puerto Rico.  The game to which all others are compared.  I was surprised to see, way down at the bottom of the scale the (often amusing) vitriolic criticism of this game.  While I can appreciate that no game is EVERYONE's cup of tea, I must wonder if some of these people really are gamers and are turned off by the the depth (beyond parcheezi) or are uber-patient and have hours and hours at a time to play the often tedious games they mention.   

This game does not play itself. And I do not ask monkeys to play so it does not take forever to explain to newbies.

Bringing the rating down to a 7.  After owning this title for over a year now, I can say it really grows on you in time.  At first I wasn't so keen, but after a while of playing and seeing so many different types of games played, it's great to know that it'll always be a fun time whn the PR comes out.  Many of my friends went from "What the heck is Puerto Rico?" to "Puerto Rico's a lot of fun!" in under 2 hours.

When do I play this?:
Best played with board-game inclined friends and newbies.  It can be daunting to teach, but once the concept is grasped it's accessible to all but the youngest of children.

This game is a 10 when played with a even playing field, though goes to an 8 when playing with a weak link.

Original boardgame that "San Juan" cardgame was based on. It is (a little) longer and heavier than SJ, with several more things to think about.

Can be played with official 2-player variant (from "Alea"), although it isn't as good with only 2 players(?) or at least not as good with 2 as SJ is.

WARNING: Minimal luck involved - might develop into quite scripted sequence of play / openings, although there appear to be many possiblities to try. The gameplay itself would still likely be enjoyable anyway.

So far the best implemented mechanic of role-action selection (seen in Verrater and adopted in Citadels), being that once chosen each player executes that action to a lesser degree, rather than wait for their turn to choose a role. However this mechanic is repetitive and is less fun than the bluffing way it was employed in Citadels. And lack of fun is an issue I have with this game. It is a dry exercise of evaluating your best options to maximise your victory points, not much randomness except with the plantation tile draws. So this is a game for those who like to explore the way buildings and roles interact to develop tactics and strategies. It doesn't help first timers that evaluating involves text reading of the effects of the numerous buildings which makes play confusing and slows pace; personally I prefer coloured symbols for the buildings and having a player aid to refer to. And because I've seen Amistad and read Serpent & the Rainbow I relate too much to the very strong theme of black slavery; I play games at times to engage my narrative attitude to have fun and promote an atmosphere, and when I play Puerto Rico I have to abandon this attitude which then reduces the rating. Still I appreciate this design as one of best in the business management style of game, which I guess is one reason alot of people enjoy it.

I really like Puerto Rico, but I am starting to think that it's not random enough. This is bad because victory and defeat can be at the mercy of where you are sitting with respect to the bad player, which makes the game more random than other games with real random elements.

Having said that, the mechanics are brilliant, and the game is a terrific thought problem. I highly recommend Puerto Rico!

I enjoy this game a great deal, but explaining it to new people is a pain.  I try to introduce people to Race for the Galaxy and then this when I can (and if they have time).  It's amazing what that combo does.  They get to play a crap game of Race for the Galaxy and an actual game of Puerto Rico.

RATING: 8
Haven't played it all that much (barring PC version plays) but it does feel a little scripted. Fantastic game for its time and still always happy to play. Good game with a trace amount of luck.

Edit: Have been playing lately with more experienced players which has upped my appreciation for the game. Maybe once I start playing tournament-level it will be a 10 :p.

This game really needs an experienced group. But it is fantastic when you have one.

RATING: 8
50+ plays.  Lives up to the hype.  Very well balanced and themed.  Classic.  I actually prefer the 2 player version over more players.
Misses a 10 as it can be very dependent on less experienced players becoming king maker.  Can also become somewhat formulaic.  Lots of strategic discussion after plays.

The biggest complaint that I've heard about this game is that it is ultimately solvable -- there are correct and incorrect actions that players can take at any given time. I haven't dealt with this...I (and all of the players in my game group) are TERRIBLE at this game, and as a result, we end up with a pretty wide array of play styles. I love the game at this point because I haven't "figured it out." Only time will tell if it gets stale as I improve, but for now, it's one of my favorites.

[floatleft][ImageID=93199][/floatleft][b][u]Initial Impressions:[/u][/b]
No one can deny the greatness of Puerto Rico (PR) which has stood at the top of the BGG rankings mountain for years and years. I think people sometimes forget how great a game PR is because it has been around for so long and was played with such intense frequency when people first learned of it. PR was a game changer over a decade ago and it helped bring the modern Euro to the forefront of the board gaming world. 

[b][u]What I like:[/u][/b]
So many games mimic the role selection mechanism in Puerto Rico for good reason. It's brilliant.

[b][u]What I dislike:[/u][/b]
I think what I dislike most about Puerto Rico, and most people will agree with this, is that there really are only two distinct avenues to victory: violet buildings or shipping lots of goods via the Captain. I still love this game though.

[b][u]Overall:[/u][/b]
PR has withstood the test of time for over a decade. Very few games can make such a claim. If there was a Board Gaming Hall of Fame, there is no question that PR would be one of the first games to be inducted.

I upgraded to the Collector's Edition copy and sold off my standard copy.

I used to think this game warranted a 9- until I caned four other players without building any large buildings. I think we&#039;ve finally found the right way to play it as the colonists and the victory points seem to run out around the same turn. It&#039;s very good as it is a game where you have to capitalise on the opportunities presented to you rather than have some preconceived plan. There really are an enormous number of ways you can ensure victory.

P: 2-5, T: 60 min, ON BGA
+No luck outcomes, all based on player decisions. Many paths to victory and paying attention to other players actions. Encourages many strategies and adapting to game conditions mid-game.

=A bit complex, beginning players will likely need 1-2 plays to get a grasp of the rules 

-A bit like multiplayer solitaire, player interaction can seem too subtle for some. Some buildings aren't ever used. 2 player set-up suboptimal

I enjoy this game, but I don't think it's a game I want to play very often.  With repeated plays, it starts to feel very similar, like the game plays exactly the same every time.  It's fun to introduce to new people because they inevitably are impressed by how well the mechanics work together.

Eh...okay, I know it is well loved, but it doesn't really connect with me the way it does with others.  I think it is fun, but I also think it can be sort of same-y after a while.  Oh.  You're doing coffee?  Alright.  I won't do coffee.  You're going after that building?  Alright.  Me, too.  Aw, someone else got there first.  There goes my entire strategy.  Oh well.  Want to play again?  Nah, me either.  
I'd put this in the same category as Catan.  It was innovative at the time, but I need some chrome on my games these days.  This just doesn't scratch the Euro itch the way it did ten years ago.

Many strategies can lead to victory.  The first game is a bit of an information overload due to the fact that you spend cards to play cards, and every card has writing on it.  But, once you get the general feel for cards, and understand the logic of the whole thing, the game moves much more smoothly.

So what's the deal here anyway?  Is each player in a parallel universe with their own island of Puerto Rico?  And are these parallel universes somehow synced up in such a way that when goods are shipped in one of the Puerto Ricos, they must also be shipped in all of the others?  Some kind of quantum entanglement perhaps?

I can't answer these questions, but I can say that this is truly a design masterpiece.  It definitely has some weaknesses, but playing a game with experienced players is a great challenge, and more importantly, great fun!  This is by no means a "luckless" game.  The random plantation draw is a much bigger factor than most people think.  On the other hand, the plantation draw keeps the game fresh by making each play a different experience.

It still has the best balance of long term strategy and short term tactics and the perfect play time.

RATING: 7
After 6 playings and a lot of tutorial discussions with my son, I'm beginning to figure this game out. Everyone needs to be on the same level in this game or the player after the dolt (aka ME!) has a huge advantage.  Need a lot more thought on the more expensive building tiles and on how to optimize what the player before me allows me while minimizing what I allow the player after me.  Certain strategies and devious/heinous tactics, if allowed to occur, will effectively end the game.  Like Chess, once a winning position is obvious, no need to play out the remainder of the turns. Very good, but not great, game; WAY over-rated on BGG. (My gut gives it a 6, my head thinks I should be able to play well enough to admit to a 7).

The use of the role selection mechanic makes the game very much one of timing so you can accrue the incremental advantage. Also how you have to observe the strategies you opponent is following so you can adjust accordingly.

As a result I could easy see how it would lose its replay value

Excellent game. I recently introduced this game to my gaming group. They suddenly wanted to play it again. And again. And again. 

As we broke up for the night conversation focused on ideal strategies, what errors we may have made, when we would want to add the expansion. And when we would play Puerto Rico again.

I have never seen my group get so excited about a new (for us) game. So I granted Puerto Rico my first 10 rating. Then I realized I was just so excited at scoring such a hit with my group. A rating of 10 means "Always want to play and expect this will never change."

Update: realistically, I can't justifiably give this a rating of 10. It will have to suffer with being my highest rated game at 9.25.

There's just something about putting those little disks on your plantations and seeing the goods roll in!  In Puerto Rico you operate a plantation and can produce several different goods.  It's your job to provide employees and buildings, which give you certain benefits.  Can you put your benefits to work for you and earn the most points?

What a game!!
The bits could have been better (imagine 3D plastic buildings, little colonistmeeples, wooden toy boats...) but the gameplay is just perfect.
There are lots of options and it's very little luck dependent. Each time the optimal role choice is different, and usually not any obvious. It's always fun, but as players are more experienced the game gets better.
Plus, it's quite tactical: you've got to be very flexible and open minded as there is not such a thing as a best strategy that can be applied to every game. It depends on the other players actions. That's real interaction and that's what makes PR fascinating.

First impression:
Played a two player variant. The game turned out very smootly. There's a lot of possibilities and you have to manage the fact that you opponent will do the same move as you. So you need to make sure that you won't advantage him more than you. The goods management, without being revolutionnary, his effective.
There his a definit learning curve. You need to learn all the building fonctions to be good and built yourself a strategy during the game.
Deserve to be in the top 10 on BGG but may be not first.
Can't wait to try it in a multiple player game.

Update: Played a 3 player game. Even better this time, upgraded my cote from 8.3 to 8.75.

Première impression:
Partie à deux à l'aide d'une variante. La partie s'est déroulée de façon très fluide. Il y a beaucoup de possibilité et vous devez gérer le fait que votre adversaire fera la même action que vous. Vous devez donc vous assurer de ne pas l'avantager plus que vous. La gestion des biens, sans être révolutionnaire, s'avère efficace. Il y a une courbe d'apprentissage définitive pour ce jeu. On doit connaître le rôle de chaque bâtiment afin d'être bon et de pouvoir se bâtir une stratégie à ce jeu. Mérite d'être dans le top 10 de BGG mais peut-être pas en première place. J'ai bien hate de jouer une partie à plusieurs joueurs.

Mise à jour: Nous avons joué une partie à trois joueurs. Le jeu s'avère encore meilleur. J'augmente la cote de 8.3 à 8.75.

RATING: N/A
There's a lot of good stuff going on in this one. It's a great example of a worker-placement Eurogame, and the role-selection mechanic just flat-out works. It's exactly what it claims to be: a dry, strategic, largely non-random and well-balanced Euro. If games that are dry, strategic, non-random, or European make you balk, you should move on. But if those types make you happy, you can get a lot of mileage from it.

Tentative rating: 7.5/10 it might not be for me, and that's ok.

RATING: 9
I am surprised that I had not rated this until now. A classic game that I enjoy, especially with a random selection of buildings from the original as well as the expansion. The base game has been analyzed nearly to death, but with the expansion there is a lot more fluidity to the game, a greater need for tactical skill in dealing with a changing environment. This is easily a top-shelf game.

Don't bother trying if you are playing with someone new to the game or lacking tactical abilities...

I will always tend to get caught up in the quest to build something, but after many, many plays, I find I look forward to other games more.

Örök klasszikus! Nagyon jó játék, egyedi mechanikával. Szerintem kezdőknek is megfelelő és kellő áttekintést ad a "modern" társasokról. Kezdőknek is tolerálható nehézségekkel.
Az alap design-ja lehetett volna kicsit ütősebb.

Update: Sok kihagyott idő után, cseréltem magyar példányra és ennek okán újra játszottunk vele egy-kettőt. Sajnos csak 2 fős-t. Azért előjött, hogy miért hagytuk sokat a fiók mélyén. Elismerve erényeit, azért van egy-két alap taktika, amit igazából csak váltogatni kell, mert ha újat, mást próbálsz ki, ki is kapsz. Picit így egysíkúvá is vált. Persze lehet rossz passzban játszottunk. :)

Great game for gamers and non-gamers, it's a game you can play with your family and with your hardcore gaming group and enjoy it every single time.

RATING: 7
It's hard to say something that hasn't been said about Puerto Rico.  I'm sure nothing I say is new and the only unique thing about what I say is that I said it.

How does Puerto Rico work?  There are two major parts.  First players all have identical player boards that represent a section of the eponymous island and a piece of the city San Juan.  Players have spaces to develop plantations of various kinds and build buildings.  Plantations produce various goods, though Corn is the only good that doesn't require an accompanying building, while the buildings provide special powers.  The produced goods can be converted into money, necessary for building buildings, or points, necessary for winning the game.  A neat twist in game terms, though the cause of some social controversy, is that plantations and buildings need to be manned by "colonists" in order to perform their function.  A good player in Puerto Rico will get a combination of buildings and plantations that efficiently work together, producing more VPs relative to the other players per action taken.

That's what players do, but the other major part of the game concerns the method by which things get done: role selection.  Everything in this game is done with role selection, from producing goods, to hiring colonists to building buildings.  In Puerto Rico you can't just say, "I got money so I want to build a building".  Rather you have to select the Builder role and in doing so, you give everyone else the opportunity to build a building, assuming they have the cash.  If the Builder has already been picked when your turn comes around to pick a role, you are out of luck till the end of the round and all roles become available again.

This makes timing critical.  Sometimes your "best" role choice will help another player out much more than it will you.  Good players put themselves in a position where other players' role selections help them while their own role selection will either minimally help, or even hurt other players.  Figuring out how to ride these various waves is my favorite part about Puerto Rico.  However, many people hate it.  They don't like that a weak player can set up a wave that really helps others.  Frankly, I think such players take this game too seriously.  So what if a noob gives the game to another player, if he has fun then he'll play again and eventually get better.  Rule wise the game is very simple.  What complications there are arise from the plethora of powers the buildings provide and how their effects can snowball.  Set up is kind of fiddly, but over all Puerto Rico is a solid game and preferable to many of its descendants.

Speaking of descendants, it's hard to believe that at one point when we talked about German/Euro games we meant Settlers of Catan, El Grande, Tikal, Ra and Tigris and Euphrates.  Now the genre is dominated and almost defined by "efficiency engines" and Puerto Rico is the originator of this trend.  Sure there were efficiency engines before Puerto Rico.  Outpost and Princes of Florence spring immediately to mind.  But neither one of those games defined a genre that has been hemorrhaging games of various quality ever since.  Caylus, Leonardo Da Vinci, Pillars of the Earth, Stone Age, Dominion, Agricola and Le Harve, not to mention card games like Race for the Galaxy and San Juan are all part of this genre [Note: as of Oct 2009 4 of the top 10 games on BGG are games of this type while Space Hulk has knocked a fifth down to number 11].  

The link between these games and Puerto Rico is not just that they are efficiency engines, but that they are role selection games as well.  Prior to Puerto Rico players would have fought over who could do what using some kind of auction.  By not having an auction Puerto Rico changed the game.

In my opinion the most innovative element of Puerto Rico is not its efficiency engine-ness or its role selection.  Rather, Puerto Rico is a phasing game but on a turn, when a player chooses the role they want, they are also choosing the phase that the game will enter next.  Most games of this kind, like Power Grid or Age of Steam, are vary rigorous in the way they step the players through the phases.  Oddly enough, this element of Puerto Rico is the least copied.

Rules are very intuitive (the game mechanics and the theme are so well integrated, and the game itself is so easy to teach) and turns go by quickly. Because there is no hidden information, it's much easier to make rule clarifications during the game.

Personally, I admire this game—I like its economic model—but I prefer games with positional tactics. More significantly, this is a game in which you make very little major decisions (although these decisions have a huge impact on your game). The rest of the decisions you make in this game are rather straightforward. I would rather have more turn angst—or rather, I’d rather have my angst better distributed.


UPDATE: Downgrade to a 4. Will always keep this game because it is so easy for newbies to play. But I prefer to play against players, not a system.

The upside:
-The first love. Eye-opener, groundbreaker, masterpiece.
-In the core is a role selection mechanism that I like, but what really makes it for me is being able to have everyone take the same action but a bonus given to whom selected it.
-Lot's of buildings to incorporate in your strategy, and the same one can be considered broken, worthless, to just right in different games, the key is the obvious "select the right ones for what you're doing".

The downside:
-It's been studied so much that you stumble everywhere with optimal strategies, plays, openings, etc. I guess it only happens to the great ones.
-I can't say it is as fresh as it once was, but which is?

After more plays, revising score down - If it's going to be so popular, I'd expect it not to be so inherently unbalanced (Settler/Quarry on first turn, Small Market, etc).
Compelling mechanics do not an enjoyable game make. This game is WORK, every time it comes up - flawed work, making up for and ignoring unbalanced buildings, at that.

However, it IS worth picking up for $2 at GoodWill.  :)

The passage of time has made me appreciate Puerto Rico much more than I used to.  I've always liked it, but after 7 plus years playing boardgames, I've realized just how well designed this game is.  It might be a little dry and overly deterministic for some, and I can somewhat sympathize with that.  But I tend not to be bothered by those elements in a game, if the rest of the game can provide me with the kinds of decision making I find engaging about games in general.  In my opinion, there are few middle-weight euros that provide this much depth of gameplay, and Puerto Rico is certainly one of the best of that few.

One of the classic,s and I can see why. Very strategic without becoming too complex. The artwork could have been a bit nicer though... one thing i dislike about the game is that if you are at a bad spot around the table it can cost you a lot of point (eg when you sit at the left of a player who is using the same kind of resources, it means that for at least 3-4 turns in a row he wil always beat you to the ships or merchant ...)

This can be considered to be a deeper game but its been one of the more easily taught games I have.  The gameplay is very intuitive.  Nice components and box organizer.  The only thing I don't like about this game is that to win you really have to constantly be thinking about how your decisions can hurt the other players as well as help yourself.  Its not a game that you can just concentrate on what you're doing in the game which take away some of the fun for me.

This is a great game.  Always a favourite at game night and never seems to get old.  The strategy is difficult and the randomness of the plantation tiles keeps you on your toes enough that you can't employ the same strategy game in and game out without changing the game play.  There is no direct player interaction, but every move you make immediately affects everyone on the board so the indirect interaction creates quite a bit of tension without making the game a friend ender.  Great fun.

When we purchased the game it didn't have enough pieces for a 5 player game, so we were sent a new copy which ALSO didn't have enough pieces for a 5 player game.  We combined the two and made a game large enough for six.  That being said, 5 players are a bit much for this game so I wouldn't get too hung up on that.  

The other downside is in game artwork is extremely lacking.  It's as though they put so many resources into game play development that they just didn't even bother to decorate building tiles.  It's not the most aesthetic game ever.

But in conclusion these negatives are external and have zero effect on the quality of the game.  You can find variants for two players as well.  We've found the best 2P variant to be one where the governor selects two roles and the second player selects one role, like the San Juan game.  It speeds up game play and brings in more strategy that going through all roles every round.    Depending on your gaming crowd expect games with first time players to run a minimum of 2.5 hours.   Once players understand the mechanics (usually after one playthrough) the game shortens quite a bit. We've yet to find a person who didn't enjoy this one.  I hope you do as well.

Only played a few times, and I 'think' I like it, but I keep wanting more from it, and I'm afraid it just may not be there.

Have been able to play this several more times, and now I totally get it. This is a great game and I love it!

One of the best gamer's games in recent years. The mechanics in this game are pure genius. Also the theme feels quite strong somehow. Maybe it's the Buena Vista Social Club playing on the background when we play ;) Finally: screw coffee and tobacco, give me sugar!

RATING: 8.01
My group actually started with Puerto Rico! This was our gateway game to the modern boardgames and before that we only had played others games that are famous in Brazil, like War and Monopoly.
I like how there are almost no luck into it, however there is something in this game that makes me a little upset if someone does an action that ends up screwing me and I think that happens because this game can sometimes get I little bit stuck, meaning that the flow isn't always the way that I wanted it to be.
Besides that, it is a great game with a lot of strategic plays into it!
The replay ability is not very good, but when we didn't know nothing but this game, we played it a lot!

I mostly play Puerto Rico with one other person, and the two player variant that we created is less fun than the game would be with three or more.  I think the need to play this variant has lessened my enjoyment of the game somewhat.

I love the pieces, the concept, the play style, the huge amount of different strategies that can be implemented.  But Puetro Rico just isn't as good with two.

Good game, it's unfortunate that there seem to be people who will only play when everyone is making the perceived 'optimal' plays...I find that doing something surprising can throw someone off and open the door for a win.  I still like it a great deal.

Needs to be played with mostly equal ability players otherwise seating position can severely help/hurt certain players and strongly determine the outcome of the game. It also gets a little "static" with the same buildings each time.  Expansion can help, but sometimes I feel like certain buildings are just not worth purchasing ever, so why even include them?  Otherwise it's a great game with a few quirks, stated above.  Still love it though!

Such a clasic. Very good game, I played it over and over again for a long time before i got a little bit tired of it. Now i still come back to it from time to time and i have fun every time. 

For some reason our group didn't like the expantions. Specially the one with red "colonists". In this one they removed the game end condition about slaves supply running out. It literaly broke the 5-player version. Red colonists make everything cheaper and everyone got a lot of buildings, but nobody got all places covered when we run out of buildings, add this to the fact that picking craftsman is usually very bad and we ended up waiting for the victory points to run out for another 3 hours. What a pain. How could somebody miss it.

It's obvious why this is the longtime #1 ranked game. It does so many things right. The theme is interesting and accessible to a broad audience. Giving each player their own board lets them grow more attached to what they create as the game progresses. The design keeps players involved by constantly offering players choices -- even when it's not their turn. A must-have for any board gamer.

A very tactical game with role-selection, but for me by far not the best. Generally you play solitaire, and the brain-burning factor makes it difficult to put it onto the table after those long working-days.
EDIT: I began to see the end of the tunel. Slowly the game clicked to me, and now it is one of my favorites. With people allready knowing the rules the game can end in 1 hour and it generates always discussion afterwards.

Great game.  My wife and I both really enjoy it and also enjoy the two player variant(s) that have been posted here.  Awards very aggressive and cut-throat play.

We downloaded the expansion, but have only played it a couple times and keep going back to the original.  Although, I've heard that many people prefer the expansion because it allows players more viable stratagems; however, we are still finding deeper and deeper ways to play with just the original set and have played quite regularly since early 2007.

Very good 2, three, four and five player game.  Best yet the play of your timing needs to change to match the number of players.  Awesome game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Similar to Caylus, it took me a while to "get" this game, and really understand and appreciate the far reaching implications of even my minor decisions.  I do think there is some merit to the notion that where you sit can be a benefit based on how good the other players are, but I also think it is slightly overstated.

Maybe you could have people bid VPs for seating order, with the higher bidders choosing their seat later (highest bidder choosing last).  This would nicely handicap the players that thought themselves "better" while still allowing those players to make a tactical decision on that aspect of the game.  Might as well let the highest bidding player name the "starting" player as well.

Great game.  I've only played a few times....but it was fun to beat my teenage sons with one strategy and when they both tried that strategy, I changed strategy and beat them again.  Only problem is that every year they get smarter and I get dumber!  :)

RATING: 9
A solid game that provides many different interacting paths to victory. Perhaps it's greatest strength is how easy it is to understand and approach. Want cheaper buildings? Buy X. Want to make victory points through export? choose Y.

the expansions are by no means important for this game, but the added variety is kind of nice.

RATING: 6
This game has not grabbed me the way it has for most people on the 'geek. Played it several times, and now each game feels the same to me.  
One problem I notice is that if you get someone weak or who does not care just to your right you have a huge advantage, where as if you get someone up stream of you who likes screwing over those following him you will have a very hard time of it.  Perhaps you could randomize  who sits where between each round?
UPDATE, someone said "lets play P.R." and my emotional reaction made me realized that the game had dropped for me.  I really enjoyed this game when it came out (rated it an 8.5 and I don't give high ratings lightly), but it has been played out for me.
Rather than this game I would get "Race for the Galaxy" which is similar and fixes the problems in this game.

This is one of the few games where my enjoyment is very dependent on my opponents.  If the players are casual Puerto Rico players, I enjoy the game quite a bit and have fun enjoying the ride.  However, if my opponents are dedicated players, that have analyzed the tech tree and have min/maxed the game to its fullest extent, the enjoyment of the experience plummets quite a bit.  While that can probably be said for many games, there aren't dedicated people out there for many other games, but it isn't hard to find one for Puerto Rico.  So, because of this, it must reside somewhere on the 6 or 7 scale on the BGG system, because I'm not ALWAYS willing to play, but I am with the right crowd.  I'll go with the higher rating and give it a seven.

A beguiling strategic masterpiece that just gets better the more you play it.  Can seem a bit daunting at first, but the trick is to just dive in and try things out; soon enough, the tactics begin to reveal themselves and the mechanics become instinctive.  Don't let the separate player boards fool you into thinking there's no way to screw over your opponents.. you'd be ever so wrong!

RATING: 7.5
Very good and deep Euro with only a minimum of randomness (and variety). This is really a classic now, but still sees a lot of plays, because of its solid mechanisms. First (or  at least most importantly) it is game with action/role selection, which determines the action for all players. 

Producing, selling and shipping goods is thematic at first glance. But since turn order is that important in Puerto Rico and  every action sets your opponents up as well, you cannot play this game just with thematic intuition. You really need a few games to understand the game. This makes Puerto Rico very rewarding for "core" gamers, but in my view it is exceptionally bad for a gateway game (I have seen discussions, in which it was recommended as a gateway). The most clever but also for new gamers least intuitive mechanism is the forced shipping in combination with rotting resources: If you produce resources with the plan to sell them and then someone becomes captain, you will ship or lose most of your resources. This is a rather unforgiving, but very iconic mechanism of Puerto Rico, which really awards experience with the game. 

I do not rate Puerto Rico higher, because this really feels much more like playing the mechanisms and less like playing a game of Caribbean economy and trading. But I have  to give credit that this mechanisms are really good.

I had to lower my rating for Puerto Rico in order to be consistent. If the rating is based on my willingness to play (and not on objective criteria), then the game is a 7. This would be a 10 if I were rating games based on how good they are, but I'm not. My issue is that so many people have analyzed this game to death that it's not always fun. I enjoy it most with people who are in the same boat as I am: played a decent number of times - know the basic strategies, but don't know enough to have everything completely laid out.

As a plantation owner you grow crops, store them, and ship them, purchasing enhancements to do all of these more efficiently than other players. Buy buildings with the money you earn for VPs, balancing cash, colonists, and your supply/production chain. Very interactive (e.g. due to limited buildings, ships, etc.). High replayability.

Players: 2-5
Time: 90-150 min.  

Players are colonizing the island of Puerto Rico and producing crops in the plantations as well as constructing buildings in San Juan. Players have several paths to victory and many tactical decisions to make. The fun of the game is building your own "business", seeing how well it works and choosing from many different options. There is little downtime as every player has decisions to make regardless of whose "turn" it is.

Played again for the first time in probably 7 years.  Still a good game with interesting decisions.

I feel like it's a bit dated, for some reason.  Like there are games I own that fill a similar niche better.  Probably because I view-it through a worker-placement lens rather than a role-selection one and I own some w-p games I really like.

It stayed at number 1 for years for a reason.  It is that good.  The players are plantation owners in Puerto Rico in the days when ships had sails. Growing up to five different kind of crops: Corn, Indigo, Coffee, Sugar and Tobacco, they must try to run their business more efficiently than their close competitors; growing crops and storing them efficiently, developing San Juan with useful buildings, deploying their colonists to best effect, selling crops at the right time, and most importantly, shipping their goods back to Europe for maximum benefit.

RATING: 7.7
Its a pretty good game. San Juan is better, being more polished, avoiding the rapid crunch in the end-game which is a feature of many of the in-built timers used in Euro-games, and just being altogethor smoother. However, since Puerto-Rico came first you really have to give credit for the originality of the concept.

A very good game, but not quite as good as some suggest.  Basically it's a game of cornering a market and/or strategy.  Whoever can exploit their market and/or strategy the best, wins.

RATING: 8
An excellent game with only minor
problems in game design:

The game has a number of buildings
which are overpriced and thus rarely
are purchased.

The game tends to end earlier than I
would have thought best; and thus
Many interesting strategies are not
Feasible because the game ends before
they can effectively get going.
Thus also game strategy tends to follow 
a few patterns of development repeatedly
Instead of allowing a greater range of 
players decisions
or strategic options.

All in all however this is a fine game.

This is one of those classic games which I've never really played enough to get into, and appreciate its depths. While I don't think it would have anywhere near the status it does had it come out in the last couple of years, there being several dozen (at least) other Euros which I both find more fun and suspect are deeper, this is still a game I would like to play more times and get an understanding for the strategies. But more or less everyone else in my group feels similarly to me - that it's a good game, and always enjoyable to play, but never one that comes to mind as a "we must play this again" when choosing a game on a game night.

We've only played this once and we screwed up the rules even, but I can see that this game is going to become a family favorite. The game mechanics of role selection, worker placement and economic development are fun and educational. It's fun to build your plantations and factories, man them and then produce your goods. There something satisfying about that to me. The only thing holding me back from rating this a 10 is the enormous learning curve for non-gamers. It's an odd thing though...as soon as you've "got it" it doesn't seem difficult at all, but try explaining it to someone who doesn't play these kinds of games and...wow...it's not easy to explain. It's a bit fiddly with LOTS of pieces-parts and the setup time can be a pain if you don't separate the pieces well. But despite that, it's an awesome game.

UPDATE: I've played probably closer to 60+ games of PR now and it is a truly awesome game. You'd think it would get repetitive, but not really. This a truly a classic that will stand the test of time.

(8/17/07) - Purchased

(8/30/07) - I'm eager to play this one because of the hype and high ratings surrounding it!

(12/8/07) - [9] - Played it today for the first time. Definitely worthy of the #1 Ranking.

(8/12/08) - [7.5] - Nothing personal against Puerto Rico, but other games have shown me it isn't as great as I once thought it was. Rerated to a 7.5. As a 2-player game with the official variant it is still a 9 though. With 5 players it becomes a 5.

(5/1/13) - Puerto Rico has been sold as part of a larger liquidation of my collection. I can always go for an electronic version if I'm dying to play it again.

An amazing game that plays very differently depending on the number of players.  3 player games are slowly becoming my favorite because they are relatively shorter and I feel like I have more control.

Puerto Rico is a clever game with real replay value, but in my opinion it has two huge disadvantages:

The points required for victory are "hidden", which means (given all players match each other) you never know who is in the lead. This results in an absence of climax and satisfaction.

Next to this, when you play this game with unexperienced players, I get the feeling there is not enough interaction between players as novices usually try optimize their own board, rather than interfere with actions of other players.

PR is an amazing game to me. I'm really not all that interested in the subject matter, as I'm more of a sports/war gamer. The game is SO well-designed, though, with so many neat ways of doing things. It really is like a work of art.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Clearly, this game is well thought out and offers a near luck-independent experience.

That's not to say it is exempt from defects and one of them is that each player's score and therefore the winner is heavily influenced by who is around the table, and what strategy they pursue.

On the one hand this makes it a tactical game worthy of its salt, but on the other it reduces greatly the viability of quite a few game-length strategies and my expectation is that after the initial dozen games where you explore different paths the game will feel like a rinse and repeat if you don't inject the group with new blood.

... trouble is, new blood and old guard really don't mix well in this game and benefit from pitting players of equal standard against one another...

Update (8/08):  Puerto Rico was one of the first games I purchased in my return to gaming. In that context it was a 10 since all I had to compare it to was Settlers of Catan, Roborally, Magic, and all the Parker Bros. stuff. My collection of games is much broader now and there are games that I just would rather play if given a choice. There are also games that are derivative of Puerto Rico such as Twilight Imperium 3 and Race for the Galaxy that I find much more exciting and fun. So, design-wise Puerto Rico is a classic but in all honestly I am never the one to suggest playing it--although I always have fun when I do play.

Just played a 4 player game, second game ever against some seasoned players and won! (by 3 pts... but hey) it is really a lot more fun with 4 players. 5 may be too much and I bet 3 is nice as well but I think four is the magic number.

A very good game for people who want a lot to think about.  This is, I believe, a game for more detail-oriented people, who like to open up a watch and figure out what all the gears do.  Not to say that it's so terribly complicated--it's very easy to pick up, because the theme is an excellent fit and the game mechanics are surprisingly intuitive.  But you have to pay attention to so many details of what other people have.  As much as I like this game (I do really like it), it's not quite my cup of tea.  But I can see why others would really REALLY like it.  Chess : Puerto Rico :: Physics : Biology.  Get it?    UPDATE:  Clicking together for me as a nice light game, rather than the intricate hard-game I had thought it was.  Like a machine with lots of bright buttons that are fun to push.  May change my mind with further plays.

Edit 11/07: It's been a long time since I got to play PR.  It isn't that I don't want to play, I've just been buying too many new games.  Soon I'll go back to my first love and undoubtedly be resmitten.

Traded this away to Jeremy Avery (familygaming).  I used to rate this a 10, but I think I was just caught up in the PR GeekFever of '02.  It certainly is a masterfully designed game, it's just not *my* type of game.  The part I dislike most is the "stifling."  Essentially, each move consists of figuring out how to stifle your opponent so they won't be able to do anything productive on their move.  This is the same reason I don't really like Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix or Cartagena.

I admit that this is a good design. But this kind of encapsulates everything about the modern Euro design, BGG fetish object that leaves me cold - tightly constrained play options, optimizable starts, coldness.

Compare it to: the psychological fluidity and drama of El Grande, the tenseness and desperation of Taj Mahal...

Where you sit before you start to play this game has much too big of an impact on the outcome. I got burned out on this game; after several years, I played it again with others who hadn't played in a long time and it felt fresh and fun again- which reminded me of why everyone fell in love with the game in the first place. I'll probably still avoid pulling this out very often - it's a pretty dry experience for the most part - and only with people that don't play it religiously.

This is a great classic board game which is still fresh, with an excellent design.

I´ve played this game a lot in my iPad and I love it: the more I play it, the  more I like it, and the more I enjoy it. Usually I play "PR" 2 players (with my wife), and it works perfect. Excellent game, with very good mechanics, easy to learn, quick setup, and easy to explain to anyone.

I've had a lot of fun with this game so far. It has many choices, and the game becomes faster paced and more angst-inspiring as it goes along. I tried to play it once or twice on BSW, but that's incredibly boring. I would strongly suggest playing it face to face with some friends. 

The best advice I can give is this: avoid outside analysis of the game. Just play it and enjoy it. It seems that most people get bored with it after they do the chess-like analysis that Puerto Rico is prone to.

My rating is based on the advice that it not be studied. I suspect my rating will go down as I learn more about the game. For a fully studied rating, I would put it at a 6.

Seems like it was a great game back in its day, but we didn't try it until 2015, and it really did not shine compared to all of the other games that we played this year.  Just a basic, extremely dry Euro game.  The role selection is interesting, but we like it better in Race for the Galaxy.

I love not only the theme of this game but the gameplay mechanics as well. My wife and I tend to settle into the roles of builder (me) and shipper (wifey). Each game is a race to get that 12th building constructed before the wife takes the lead in points. Every game has an exciting finish.

Also up there with Le Havre as my top games of all time. This game is a gem that always catches my eye. I could play this game any day. I also bought this game when it came out on the iPad. The iPad edition is a wonderful rendition of the board game and I can also play it whenever I want to even when no one is around to play the board game version. Everyone should have this game in their collection.

I finally got to play the former BGG number 1 game. Having played Race for the Galaxy prior to this, I saw a lot of similarities and now know where most of Race's mechanics came from. This is not as good as RFTG, but it definitely does appeal to me. I can see that the lack of randomness is what makes it rated higher than RFTG for most users. But Race plays in a shorter time, so more games. :)

RATING: 9.5
Just classic Euro goodness, when player interaction was still a key part of their design.  I prefer mixing it up with some expansion buildings, but I still find each new play a little different in the interesting choices about how heavy to go into building/money vs shipping points, whether to specialize or diversify in production, etc.  Just the right amount of different strategic paths and player interaction.

An interesting game, but I'm not sure why people on this site rate it so highly. VERY complicated, but that's not why I didn't rate it as high as some others. It was just not quite as interesting as some games I rate higher. It's still definitely fun, but given the choice between this game and Dominion or Small World, I'd take one of the latter.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Most everyone should be familiar with this one. It is a classic game where each player builds buildings and shipps goods to gain victory points.  The thing that sets this game apart is the role selection. Players choose there rolls which allow the player to play that action with an added benefit, however all the other players get to do that same action too. Players must always guage whether it helps them out or other players out more.  This is a classic game which I will always play.

Pros: unique role selection, little downtime between turns,fun decision making process.

Cons: specific avenues for victory, not a high production value.

On more plays I am starting to feel very scripted when I play this. I tend to win way more than my share of games, but I am not sure its as much fun as it used to be. I prefer Caylus, Power Grid or Princes of Florence to PR at this point.

Until Agricola came into my life, Puerto Rico stood as the "most complicated" game I had ever played. The role selection dynamic is fantastic (you choose a role, perform it first (with a bonus), and then your opponents all perform the role). As with most games, you must think ahead to what your opponents will do, but in Puerto Rico, your position and timing of future actions are often more important than your current action.

This leads to repeated situations where choosing the role that benefits you most at that moment is a poor decision.

Another great aspect of Puerto Rico is that rarely do you feel that you are hopelessly behind. Or maybe I'm just an eternal optimist! Best of all, the luck factor is the lowest of any game I've ever played.

Fascinating.  I've played three times and I'm still pondering new strategies.  Since each player chooses a role every turn, you have a fast-paced and dynamic game with lots of twists.  Even if you never win, like me, it's fun to compete against your own prior scores.  The pieces are easily set up, without much color confusion....it evokes the colonial economies and the age of West African slavery very well.

Don't be dissuaded by the guy on the front who looks like he's got one in there sideways – they didn't have Metamucil back then.

Classic for a reason. Like any good euro, you are constantly thinking about all the moves you want to do, but probably don't have time to do. However, the twist in Puerto Rico, with the role selection, is that you might not want to take the role directly despite your desire for it, hoping someone else will do it for you. That whole element adds quite a bit of depth here as you consider when to pass up a role and when it is worth taking. It's a wonderful decision tree.

Lapkák: Magyarított HomeMade verzió.
A BGG-n elérhető redesign majd egy egész pontot dob a játék értékelésén! Máskülönben eléggé prototípusszerű a grafikai kivitelezése, ha lehet ilyet mondani erre a klasszikus nagyágyúra.

A mechanika kifogástalan, elegáns, egyszerű. Mégis valami (meg nem tudnám mondani, hogy mi) még hiányzik nekem ahhoz, hogy tökéletes 10-esre tudjam értékelni. Jó, egyrészt az, hogy a személyes kedvenceim a "szimulátor" jellegű játékok; de másrészt meg valami más (lehet már kissé elhaladt felette az idő?). Na, persze ez mind túlzás, nagyon jó játék a fenti okfejtéstől függetlenül.

Even though interaction is minimal, the huge depth and wealth of options make for a highly competitive environment in which long-term planning is just as important as the ability to compromise and make the best out of any given situation.

This is unique. This is classic. This is a master piece with simultaneous action mechanic. The only randomness lies in the plantation draw, insignificant, so this game is all about strategic. But to me, Puerto Rico is far more than that. I should say that PR lays the foundation for my understanding of strategic game, i.e. all of my gaming strategies are inspired from Puerto Rico. This game is special to me.

I just don't see why this game gets such stellar reviews.  

Given the nature of the setup it's largely play-by-committee.  You can leave for fifteen minutes, miss two of your turns and it won't matter -- the rest of the folks at the table can pick the right action for you and play it out.

A good game, but not a great one.

PR is simply put one of the best games ever made. The mechanics are clean and the games just flows. Little AP but lots of options. There are several strategies each of which can be successful. And the different building options lead to great replayability. I am always willing to play PR. Update: After more and more plays (far too many) I have noticed that due to the near identical set up every game that certain patterns appear and most games are somewhat similar. Thus this game has been somewhat lowered. Still a great game, but not the best.

Enjoyable game but little interaction between other players. A bit put out that one doesn't know who's won until the game is over though...

Revised downward to 6. After being exposed to more games I've come to realize the limitations of Puerto Rico.

It's sort of a solo game really - there are some ways of affecting the other players but not directly. There is a theme of sorts "colonists" notwithstanding but the it doesn't exactly inspire one.

Finally the game is long for what it does and ends with a summation of victory points.

I am long overdue for a reassessment of Puerto Rico, but my memory is of a game that is very well-designed being that much fun. If you're the rookie at the table the game often boils down to picking the best of a lot of bad options. It's an immensely important game, and one that still has many fans, but it remains too tied to its process and too reliant on manipulating a system for me to really like it.

RATING: 9
A deep game with great variety between every game.  The game is easiest to set up and play several times.  I have not used the expansion set only because I feel that there are a lot of nuances to the standard game I have yet to understand.  San Juan has recently edged out its sister game from teh 10 spot for me.  THis is only due to the set up speed and streamlined nature of San Juan.  With my little daughter about not having colonists and other small pieces around for her consumption works better as well.

I don't think I need to add anything else to the already overwhelming amount of praise this game has. I'll just say this: It's awesome!! :)

Own Deluxe copy.

Top 10

4plays: Quite possibly imo, the best designed game I've played to date. Everything just works right, and since the interactivity is soo high, one never feels like they're not involved. I feel lucky to own the Deluxe Edition, the original version is hiddeous. If you're a fan and have the money to spend, deluxe is a no brainer. I played two games with my g/f this week and I was delighted, that she loved the game so much. So much that it cracked her top 10 and now she's down to play it anytime.. Sweeet! Another thing that I love is really how easy and elegant the gameplay is, but to master it, is a whole different story. I'd like to play it at least ten times im the next 30 days and develop some kind of strategy, cause as of right now, I friggin suck at it. Perfect practice makes perfect though ;)

Update; Took if off my top 10 because it's not as easy to get to the table as I would like it to be. Still.. a masterpiece of game design.

Learned this in June 2009 and it was definitely the most complex game I'd seen at that point. I've played it and taught it a few times now and the mechanics are simple enough to pick up, but the complexity comes from all the different steps involved. I'm still not able to master the strategy as I'm constantly choosing roles to help other people more than myself but it's enjoyable anyway.

This game could not live up to the number one status here on the geek.  True, I only played a two-player variant.  But as far as it plays as a two players it felt like a more strategic version of jambo.  The character selection takes a few plays to figure out how to limit other player's advantages.

Yes, its elegant.  I can't think of a better design, a better skeleton for a game. No dice, no downtime, solid components and inexpensive. But it really leaves me a bit cold.  Does this theme seem exciting to anyone?  Really?  It would be more interesting if it were about almost anything else: making breakfast, filing tax forms, watching C-SPAN. Can't even really give this a nine, but I'll continue to play it.

Fun, tactical, and interesting game.

Still need to figure out even the basics of strategy, but the game seems to be a really deep, well-made, and ingenious game. Fascinating as a piece of gaming history, and responsible for so many things which I love, however, this game tends to suffer from the fact that I play with people of differing levels of experience with it. It means I'll probably be more likely to choose somthing else unless it's a group of players I know are on a simmilar level. 

I also think I find RFtG to be a better two-player game, and so tend to think of this as 3-5.

The game component is poor, and the game system is too routine. I can never understand what is funny. I don`t want to WORK even at the board game.

A jobless person will be happy to earn money in game world, i guess.

RATING: 8
Puerto Rico is a game with deep strategic play offering more than one path to victory due to the abstract method employed to gain points.  Each turn players select a role from the pool which gives each player an action, but the chooser gains a bonus.  The roles vary from adding a plantation, adding workers, building, producing goods, shipping goods, selling goods, and being greedy and taking money.  Shipping is the only role with an action that grants points, while two roles grant money which is used to build buildings which are worth points at the end of the game.  Production only works if you have a plantation and a production building of the same kind and they are both staffed.  Players will find they need to carefully balance what roles they pick at what times, and have a few backup plans as someone may choose a role at a disadvantageous time.

Players do not directly interact, however after shipping goods players may find themselves with spoilage causing all but one of their goods to be discarded.  The plantations and buildings in the game are finite, not every player will get what they want, so players must choose the right time to act or else lose out.  There are three end-game triggers, so it is difficult to delay the game, and if you are not paying close attention the game may end before you realize it.  There are a few good strategies for winning the game, but not all of them will work for each play, so players need to maintain a Plan B while also doing some form of damage control.

Puerto Rico offers depth of play and rewards careful planning and adaptability.  There is no luck in the game, though the forces at play cannot always be predicted.

I don't get all the hype - there are much better, deeper, and more fun games out there. In contrast to many others here on BGG I think there is an easily-discovered sure-fire way to win this game. Once you (or one of your opponents) has discovered it, the game is no longer any fun.

My favorite game -- hasn't changed after all these years.  Can be taught to new players fairly easily, and the game play is quick.  

It does suffer from disparate skill levels causing newbies to accidentally throw the games to experienced players, but the game itself is still wonderful.

My casual gamers are iffy on this.  This is a GREAT litmus test game -- if a new player to my group sits down at PR and says "I need to play this again!", they are a gamer at heart.

My first thought after playing this game (and again after my first 20 plays) was "Oh.  Ok.  NOW I got it figured out!  Let's play again"

The game is very good and I would still gladly pay it in an evenly skilled group, but that's the catch: add a newbie and you can as well crown the player on their left the winner. I don't have a constant group which is the main reason this doesn't land on the table as often as it has a potential for. It's also not as fun for me to play it with either newbies or experienced gamers. Other disadvantages are tacked on theme and below average producing. On the plus side, the game has lots of replayability even without the expansion and what is a good move and not depends on the number of players involved.  If you want a quicker, but deep game for a constant group it's hard to beat though.

Has climbed in the ratings for me. It really is a clever, fun little game, and a good challenge for the brain without being a brain burner. Hard choices and the ability to play different strategies and still be competitive make this a good game. There's a combination of buildings that will work for you if you can find it, based upon what your opponents are doing and what you've done up to any point. The game starts out by players usually looking to get some sort of income stream going, but with the money being added to unused roles and other opportunities coming early, this doesn't fall into that category of game where predictably each player has to build an income engine before they switch over to earning victory points. That's one of the strengths of the game - there's great variety and many ways to approach it. Top stuff.

When I finnally was able to play [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3076]Puerto Rico[/url][/i], I was already predisposed to dislike it:  I had played [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/8217]San Juan[/url][/i] and it had not pleased me much, and there had existed a two months delay in the delivery of the game from the online store where I bought it.  Besides, probably the expectations that I had were very high, given the reputation of the game.  Nevertheless, is an OK game, but I think is overrated in BGG.  There are many other games that attract me more.  The skill difference between players may be determinant.

The grand-daddy of gamer games, PR uses almost no luck as players use the cleverly designed role selection to determine what they will do next.  The brillant design is such that during each player's turn, everyone is involved and doing something.  This makes downtime non-existant and strategies are constantly changing on the fly.  The only downfall may be the lack of luck and randomness makes replayability a bit less for some seasoned veterans.

I'm still in the "honeymoon" stage, having just learned to play this game about a month ago. So right now, it's a 9. But I'm sure my feelings will ebb a little soon, and it will fall into place next to my other favorites: Settlers of Catan, Ticket to Ride and some others. I'm glad I found the two-person variants; it sat up on the shelf, unplayed, for almost a year after my husband bought it (he'd played it before) because I hadn't ever played so it was difficult to convince others to play when there were at least 3 of us. (Plus, as husband was telling me what game he planned on buying, I thought he was talking about "Santiago"--a "simple" game which I had enjoyed very much--so when he brought this home, with its seemingly-endless rulebook and million little pieces, I was NOT keen on learning it. Now I'm SOOO glad I did. Love it!)

Is any euro really meant to be analyzed within an inch of its shelf-life like Puerto Rico has been?  Yet, it has withstood all that analysis and remains a challenging and clever game.  If it has a fault, it's probably that it's very unforgiving, and a small mistake can essentially put you out of contention early on, which is fairly unusual for euros.  Primarily a tactical game of selecting the right role at the right time to be prepared for the builder, trader and captain, overall strategic play is a must.  A well-planned shipping, building or mixed strategy can win the game.

This was one of my favorite Euros when I still played them.  A clever system, but seems to fall into a pattern soon after starting.  Each player has their optimal play, with other experienced players knowing it as well.  Any break from playing what should be played often will doom the offender and  hand the game to another player.  Normally the next person to move.  It is a clever game and I only rate it a 3 because I have no desire to play it again.

A wonderful game. Setup and explanation to new players is a bit tedious, but worth it in the end. Puerto Rico is an impressively deep strategy game that offers many different ways to win. The edition of luck through plantation tiles changes the best way to win much more than it first seems. One piece of advice: choose your seating order carefully.

Puerto Rico is a wonderful game but unfortunately gets a lower score than it probably deserves as it just doesn't work as a two player game for us. I do love the game and wish I could play it more often as a three or four player game but that just doesn't happen. Definitely worth checking out.
Recommended for 3+ Players.

If I find a game more fun than this one, maybe I'll lower the rating to 9, but I haven't found one yet.  Hard to describe what's so good about it--it just is.  With a very small luck factor, the game is definitely more fun with all skilled players--there is an advantage to be seated after a weaker player.  Best with three to five players, the two-player version is merely okay.

RATING: 10
If you are even contemplating buying this game, do so. The rules may seem daunting, but in practice are very easy to get into. If anything is daunting it is the sheer number of choices you can make during the game and that affect your strategy. Even my wife who is a very casual gamer enjoys this game alot. A real gem.

Update: Ok, after waffling whether or not to give this game a 10 and moving my rating up and down, I've finally come to a decision. This game is a 10.  I've played it at least once a month for the last 3 yrs. I still think its great, my friends still think its great, and while I have a pretty steady strategy, it isn't a guaranteed win so there is always room for manuever. This one has stood the test of time, so rates a 10.

I must admit, I have played this game only once, at a board game day we had at the library.  I wasn't impressed, thought the game was quite boring, even though I won it in a close contest.

FUN ★★✰✰✰
I played it only 2 times, but I was bored after 30 minutes of play. The game is flat, no surprise, no tension. I'll try it a bit more, but for now I find it tasteless. My feeling is that the cold mechanics kills the fun.

RULES ★★★★✰
The rules are well written, easy to catch. I found all answers in the leaflet without problem.

IMMERSION ★★✰✰✰
The mechanics is well designed. Maybe too much, there is almost no place for entertainment in this computer-like system.

DEPTH ★★★✰✰
I can feel that there are strategies to understand, but I'm not sure I'll have the patience nor the motivation to dig into them.

Sure I agree it's brilliantly crafted and designed and everything is balanced just nicely. It's just that it doesn't do it for me.  It doesn't quite have the X factor and I find it a little dull.  I feel like I should like it more, it's just that I don't.  Sorry.

Well deserving of it's first place standing. A very good mix of mechanics which is nearly not random but still variable from game to game. Brilliant, and comes off without feeling fiddley like Princes of Florence.

This would be rated a 10 if I still played it a lot, but it's been some time since I've played it at all, unfortunately.

Edit: At some point I did upgrade my rating to 10, not sure when. The game deserves it.

RATING: 7
A classic that might look dated nowadays, but still grips you when you're in the game. Puerto Rico perfected the Action Choice Drafting mechanism, putting a twist such that you often do not want to pick a phase and let your opponent free-ride, but instead should set yourself up to free-ride and let your opponent pick it, such that he wastes a turn. The whole game is about setting yourself up to free-ride based on your prediction of sequential events. The only complaint is the fixed turn order (which results in left-of-newbie wins).

This is so much better than Agricola because the preset buildings are finely balanced and combine with each other in a multitude of ways, allowing you to play a much more satisfying perfect-information game (whereas Agricola's Family Game only has legs for fewer than 5-10 plays). That said, it often does seem like the first player to 2 out of Factory-Wharf-Harbor wins (at least in 3er, which I've played the most). Get all 3 and it's game over. I'm very intrigued whenever I see building-strategy victories.

This really is a brilliant strategy game.  While the choices of other players can occasionally cost or give you the game, normally the best players win.

RATING: 9
I've played it a lot despite the fact that I'm not very good at it :-)  That should tell you something.  It's fun, but I don't really have a burning desire to play it as I once did.  Don't get me wrong - I still like it very much, but it doesn't grab me like it used to.  Could be that there is so much more to choose from now.  It's ok with 3 players, but even more fun with 4 or 5.  Game can get a little unfair if the same person keeps making a bad choice - sort of like the end seat at a blackjack table.

I forgot to amend my comments after my last play.  If you have 5 people who know what they are doing and enjoy each other's company, the game can be one of the best experiences in gaming.  I especially like that it allows for chit-chat without excessive downtime.

RATING: 9
One of my favorites.  Different paths to vicotry in each game forced by opponent choices.  Lotsa blocking/ planning ahead (if I take the craftsman, he will captain, and she will do the trader, which would be bad for me, so instead I will be the mayor).  Your outcome is greatly influenced by others, so everyone at same play level is a plus.  Hardly any luck involved (so little you have to look for it hard).  Very good game.  One of my classics (along with settlers and carcassone) that really got me into the hobby deep.

While I still enjoy Puerto Rico a lot, it has definitely dropped a little in the desire to play category.  I find that 3-4 times a year scratches my itch.  This means I no longer suggest it as I can guarantee this minimum number of playings without it.  Still, it IS a fun game that I've not yet tired of playing.  While each game is no longer as different as they were at one point, since there is so much to do -- variable roles, buildings, crops -- I don't really notice all that much.  With more experience, it becomes even more important to adapt your strategy to your opponents.  A final note here -- I have to be in the mood for in order to play well.  That doesn't mean I won't have fun or maybe even be competitive, just that I won't play well.

A classic with great replay value. Many people like it with 3 players, I like it best with 5 - much more interactive, you are not guaranteed to get the building you want or you can easily get screwed if you don't think about actions you are doing. Requires both tactics and strategy, many things work together. I'd say this is probably my favorite game.

Great game, nice that there is a good amount of strategy and still a short game. Seems like most of the other heavily strategic games take a long time to play. 

Of course, that's always my main complaint too: that the game ends before my long-term strategy has had time to unfold.

Had some bad runs early on with this game and gained a dislike for it (probably due to sitting to the right of the most experienced and cut-throat players.... booo). But now that I've learned the game better and can get a good quicker strategy going the game is really growing on me.

RATING: 6
Updated again. On Boardgamearena you can find players that are on your level and beyond. This means that play is now more balanced and not dependant on bad play from others. Over there your own tactical choices start to matter more. Still, a game that needs those kind of conditions to shine should not have a higher rating than 7.

Update. Improved my rating from a 3 to a 6 after playing this on Boardgamearena. Over there you can choose the level of the opponents. So being stuck with a weak player to your right is not an issue. That makes for far more interesting plays.


I did a lot of research for my first play, and it felt pretty obvious how to play 'best'. My first two plays I won from 4 moderate players. That - to me - is not good. If you can win easily from experienced players as a beginner, something smells... My third play I had the misfortune of sitting next to someone who 'didn't know what to do' so he took the Goudzoeker (I believe it's called) and so I couldn't benefit from the ground work of someone else. That ruined it for me.

This is a fantastic game when everyone at the table is at least somewhat experienced.

RATING: 8
Puerto Rico -- For me, this falls just short of greatness due to two factors:  The involution of the steps of play (though, I admit, a game so rich in theme can't reasonably be expected to have the elegance of less intricate rules) and the almost mechanical necessity of making certain choices in response to particular moves.  These may seem rather minor, but I consider Puerto Rico so good that if it weren't for these quibbles, it would be among my  favorites.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1.5
2 solo plays. Not sure if I ever want to play it for real. Maybe once. Will see. 

It's a game in logical sequence of murdering fun in eurogames including Goa and Princess of Florence. It's the optimisation masterwork and invented leeching as "interaction". More interesting than Goa because there are more options - building one can build, paths one can pursue and there's actually a narrative to this. Actually in this regard it's similar to RFTG, a game I enjoy a lot. 

The minus side (and why I think I'll like PoF better) is that its ultimately calculable. Too much open information, too many clear limitations. Problem with optimisation games is that they give you clear confines and the only space open is to do more within that space and doing more means optimisation, mathiness and general banging of head against the wall. Actually PoF seems to mo a bit more charming and at least offers auctions. 

In short: card games with this system manage to eliminate it's problems (calculability, changing optimisation one can learn for managing risks and dealing with odds) while retaining it's strengths.

EDIT: finally played (and this after quite some time, so I forgot the "script"). Impression was pretty tedious and pedestrian. Yay, I need some plays to learn the machine and then I need t optimise it, depending on what others are doing. Can I go watch the grass grow, now, please?

Well designed game, no argument about that. But very abstract and brainy. Perfect information and no randomness lead to analysis-paralysis and scripted game play.

Having played 3 games so far (2 with 5P, 1 with 4P), I think this game is highly strategic, but also mechanical at times. The rules are surprisingly simple, and I enjoy the different combos that the buildings can pull off. However, I have finally come to realise that taking the Craftsman is usually a bad idea, and players have to set it up somehow so that an opponent has to take it. 

I enjoy Euros such as Homesteaders and Cuba, where you can personalise your own VP engine. Like those games, Puerto Rico's shine wears off a little once you discover the optimum engines to build. After that, it becomes a race to snag the buildings that you need. Still, Puerto Rico is a great game in the engine-building genre, and time flies by when I'm playing this game.

Initial impression: The setup was probably the most complicated part of this game. I would have preferred to read through all the rules first, but we made it work.

I have seen this game listed so many times. When I looked at the game it just not seem that special. The game play videos did not add any excitement and I still did not understand the amount of respect it gets. Wow was I wrong. Once you wrap your head around what to pick which you learn in about 2 rounds. What really struck me about this game is I did not spend any time thinking about how many points I had or focus on getting points. It was like I was playing and getting points was secondary. It was great just to focus why I am picking this card, oh cool you picked that I can do an action too. Then I will do this. I now understand why so many love this game.

I like the empire-building aspect which is very well done IMHO. I struggle with the Colonial theme, and it looses some points for me simply in celebrating the colonial conquest (it politely pretends not to have a slave trade, and forgets that the native peoples were killed, but that's a little too much of a history re-write for me). For that reason I've not yet bought it. 

That said, I enjoy it (and find myself feeling a bit guilty in liking it).

Lots of fun. Not too heavy, not too light. The setting isn&#039;t all that interesting (to me), but it fits the rules very well and doesn&#039;t feel like an afterthought. Although the sheer number of tokens and rules seems to scare some non-gamers at first, this is a game everyone can play and enjoy.

Great strategic game with variety & lots of hard choices. I'm not always in the mood for serious strategy, but when I am this is pretty top rate. I prefer to play it with friends, not with unpleasant whining "experts". Fortunately, by now most of those "experts" have moved on to other games.

My son and I played this with a dummy player to try to learn the rules.  I can see why this game has consistently been rated #1 - it is really great.  It isn't too hard to figure out how it works, but you can definitely see that there are great depths of strategy here that will take a lot of really pleasant game plays to master.  This was a big hit with my son and I.  Now to work on the hubby...

[20 plays] I sometimes catch myself thinking about this game for days afterward. I enjoy everything about it. Our wives enjoy the game and play it fairly competitively - so that is a big plus. PR is highly ranked because a wide variety of individuals have found it to be a fun and interesting game of strategy, it is as simple as that. It is a solid game with minimized luck and plenty of fast turns that keep all players involved. I enjoy the mechanics and theme - I really get the feeling I'm building a colonial enterprise.

Have played the 2 player variant 4 times now and I'm highly impressed that the game remains such a tight and tense contest.

The Alea expansion with the nobles is a nice addition to the game.

Most recent play May '14.

Puerto Rico is a complex and interesting game, but also fairly dry and abstract. The lack of direct conflict, drama and an engrossing theme prevent me from finding real enjoyment in this game. Also, it seems like many of the local Puerto Rico players are quiet and joyless curmudgeons who make the game even less enjoyable. I might be interested in playing again, but it would have to be with a fun group of players.

Wow this is probably the best and most popular game I own right now. My friends who have learned it only want to play PR when we get together for our weekly game night. We have upgraded many of the pieces including the goods, ships, coins, and victory points. I will add a picture of our upgrades soon. We bought both upgrades (buildings & nobles) and we enjoy playing both the vanilla game and the expansions.

Nice game, but I don't play it often enough so it takes me the first few rounds to remind myself what to do.  Doesn't seem to make it too uneven even so though.
The game can get very long when you play with people who have to figure out their move based on what everyone else might do in their next turn and all the possible combinations...

Very dry, virtually theme less and set up varies little more than chess. Normally these are things I hate in a game but I LOVE THIS ONE! One thing I love is there is very LITTLE LUCK in Puerto Rico, but it is deeply tactical with every strategy having a counter strategy.

Excellent game with clear rules and minimal downtime. It also plays quickly, so you can easily finish a couple of games in a single evening. I really like the variety of effective strategies and the importance of planning (as opposed to Caylus which is more about grabbing short term benefits). It took me a while to learn to appreciate Puerto Rico, but I'm glad I stuck around.

There's a reason it's rated so high after all these years. The 'craftsman's angst' is usually a delicious decision point. The level of play of the person before you in turn order can have a big influence on the game, but it is still enjoyable. So when teaching new people the game, I always impress upon them the dangers of choosing craftsman. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
When I first played Settlers, it had a 'wow' factor, as much because it was so different to any other game I had ever played.  Puerto Rico has the 'wow' factor for experienced gamers. How did Mr. Seyfarth do it?  The game takes roughly an hour to play with straightforward rules, but it packs so much into that time, so much tactical and strategic play, with depth that the game stands up to the analysis it has received.  Playing it is always a rush (quite heady when played at the speed you can play on BSW).  As close to a perfect game for me as I have played.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great game:  everyone is engrossed at all times and it is quite fun to build up your little operation.  My only quibbles:  it takes longer than most games to explain the rules (but it's still fine for non-gamers), it seems to end right when you are hitting your stride, and the theme is troublesome.  My friends and I find it hard to ignore that most of the actual "colonists" in Puerto Rican history were slaves, and they are essentially treated this way in the game; I would be very uncomfortable playing this game with African Americans or Puerto Ricans for that matter.

Near perfect game. My biggest problem is the huge ammount of expertise needed to play. Players really need to have similiar skill levels or it becomes rather meaningless.

I like this game a lot. There is lots of strategy, but it's not overwhelming. It straddles a good balance between seeming easy to play, but still has a lot of depth.

RATING: 7
Although there are some standard strategies, there is enough interaction to keep you on your toes. This kind of balancing act in the game's design is incredible to me. The core mechanics are elegant and ingenious, but there are some shortcomings for me: I think there is tense goodness in 2- and 3-player games. With 4 , the game slows down some, and I don't care for it so much, even though it is more interesting in many ways. Then again, maybe I just need to log more 4 and 5 player games. The game revolves around players choosing "roles" on their own turns which give themselves the most advantage and others the leat advantage. So there is a bit of min-maxing going on - but hidden victory points help prevent too much analysis paralysis. And I like the way the landscape changes based on player choices, as opposed to randomness - such as a card draw or dice role. Another game which is ingenious in this regard is Indonesia.

Puerto Rico vies for the title of "Wife's favorite game", which is great! Even though the theme (growing crops, processing crops, shipping the finished commodities to Europe) is about as exciting as a wet noodle to me, Puerto Rico truly transcends its thematic drawbacks to provide an awesome gaming experience. Puerto Rico also possesses a certain kind of dynamism by way of player interaction that I really like. It reminds me of how players bid for action selection order in El Grande, and how players can announce and bid on mergers in Indonesia - this is a hallmark of superior game design. Even though I'm personally lukewarm on El Grande, I think the game is put together really well.

The best European style board game encountered so far. Deservedly ranked #1 on BGG.

The mechanics are very elegant and the theme fits although there is some obvious dissonance in that area.

It can be unbalancing to have inexperienced players in a group, which is probably the biggest flaw of this otherwise excellent game.

Oh, and the components and graphics are definitely sub-standard. I'm hoping for a re-design and re-print, but am not holding my breath.

A BGG TOP 1-es játéka, nem véletlenül. A kinézete puritán (a nem mai kiadása miatt), de a játékmenete igazi csemege. Nagyon sok későbbi játék ebből építkezett, nem véletlenül. Épületépítés, ültetvényezés és a legfontosabb a jó akció kiválasztása, amit mindenki végrehajt, de a választó egy kis előnnyel. Ugye ismerős elemek. Agricola, RFTG, stb...
A játék fantasztikussága abban rejlik, hogy annyira eltalált a játék összetettsége, játékideje, mechanizmusai, hogy mindig úgy érzi az ember, hogy ha felajánlják szívesen ül le játszani vele.

A játék nagyszerűségét jól jellemzi, hogy az eredetileg kiadott 3-5 fős besorolás ellenére a jól megalkotott 2 személyes változat is tökéletesen működik. Ugyanolyan élménnyel, mint a több játékossal játszva.

I didn't get to try Puerto Rico until very late after entering the hobby. And I didn't know what to expect. I was aware of its classic status; but it also draws a lot of criticism due to importance of player position, dry theme, and also simply because many gamers consider themselves to have gotten past it.

Rubbish! This is beyond doubt one of the most innovative and sophisticated games ever made. The mechanisms are still fresh and can put any run-of-the-mill "worker placement" game to shame. And the game balance... just perfect.

My first game as a beginner of board games with more complicated strategies. Production and development game trying to make profit in Puerto Rico. One of my favourite games
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Very disappointed in this one.  Felt very old and clunky.  Tremendous chaos with 5 players which makes it difficult to put any sort of strategy together.  I must be a bit spoiled with modern games that tend to have multiple paths to victory.  This one has tons of limits that you are bumping up against constantly (limited goods, limited buildings, limited ships, etc.) meaning that you are funnelled along a path throughout the game.  Surprising that it is so highly regarded.

if you rely on theme to get you excited about a game, skip this one. if you can look past theme and get into the mechanisms this is one of the greatest euros ever. i wish i could play it more, but alas, most of my friends think it is bland and boring.

One play only over the board, several plays against AI in the app.  The game has grown on me with app plays.  Two complaints from our over the board play.  One, the setup is a bit painful, counting out colonists and VP for the number of players and stacking all of the buildings in their places.  There are worse setups of course, but I find some long setups fun.  Two, the components are bland (but sturdy).  The buildings are tiles, the colonists are discs, the ships are tiles, the plantations are tiles. 
 A lot of sameness.

Game play and mechanics are more important than components (as long as they don’t fall apart, which these won’t), so overall it’s a great game.  The app has the same boring graphics but does take care of setup, so this may be one occasion where I stick with the app.

At first I didn't like this game much.  But after getting several plays under my belt, I finally starting seeing the intricacies of the game, and the strategic depth.  Now I know why it is amongst the top rated games in the world.  Easy to learn, hard to master, and several possibilities for strategies.  Also, it is fun for non-gamers. My parents really like this game for some reason.  They even get into the PVP aspect, strategically blocking other players!

If it had better artwork, I'd rate it higher.

I went into this with a sour mood, expecting to hate a game about shipping off corn and coffee.  I expected to be burned by the good ratings Puerto Rico has gotten.  I am VERY pleasantly surprised to say that this is not so.  I am big on theme, yet even though sugar plantations don't evoke the most epic of images, the game was involving, challenging, and just plain fun.  Kudos to you, Andreas Seyfarth.  Kudos to you.  I am impressed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
OK, with over 300 comments on this thing, what else is there to say? One overlooked aspect of the game's "value" is (IMHO) its unique approach to gaming itself. Its multi-task oriented basics are just so different from what most of us who've been gaming for years are use to. It broadens one's thinking about what games are basically all about. Not that there aren't a lot of "multi-tasking" games out and about these days, but Puerto Rico (thank you Andreas Seyfarth) seems to have refined the process into a gem well worth owning, teaching and playing and playing and playing and. . . .

Two reasons why this game appeals to me: (1) The theme is well integrated with the play; you really do feel that you are managing a plantation rather than just trying to meet some arbitrary set of conditions. (2) You can establish a clear-cut strategy early on rather than just reacting to situations, and at the end of the day, you are left thinking of other strategies for next time. The official two-player variant works well. This is a lovely game that loses points only for lack of direct player interaction, somewhat elaborate setup, and a slight odor of political correctness.

Better than Le Harvre; mostly not just because it a very approachable and has fine mechanics, but also it lends some value to more than just monetary or material prosperity (without preaching any socialist gospels)... but VPs can be gained (not only by accumulating wealth) but by using wealth gained for things that would otherwise unattainable, that there is value in building harder and larger things that a community as a whole can benefit from.  La Havre, much like Monopoly is just a bit too hedonistic and greed (only) based.

I was hella skeptical about this one before I took the plunge. Turns out that Puerto Rico actually is all that and a bag of (VP) chips. I don't get as into the whole optimizing-the-bejeezus-out-of-it as other Euro-drones might; there are other ways I would prefer to spend 90-120 minutes. But given rum and a full complement of friends, PR provides a great time in/fun out apparatus.

UPDATE: Knocked the rating up by 1 - who am kidding? Puerto Rico is rad. I'm curious to see whether this holds up over increasing plays.

RATING: 9
I'm still getting that fun feeling from this game.

Each player has a board representing Puerto Rico, with spaces to place buildings and plantations.  On your turn, you select one of 7 unique roles.  The Builder allows you to purchase a building, Settler allows you to add a plantation to your settlement, Craftsman allows you to produce goods from your plantations, Trader lets you sell goods for cash, Captain lets you ship goods for victory points, Mayor gives you colonists to activate your plantations and buildings, and the Prospector gives you cash.  You are interested in everyone else's turn because when a role is selected, everyone gets to do it (build, trade, etc).  Once everyone has had a chance to perform the action, the next person selects a different role.  

My regular group never lets too much time pass before requesting this, and I have almost always found it to be a satisfying gaming experience.  

Plays best with 4 or 5.

May actually move this from a 10 since I may just be participating in the groupthink.  I enjoy this game since there is the right balance of complexity and decision-making.  It seems that everyone else has so much more experience that it will be tough to win this one.

UPDATE: Dropping this to a 7 as I find there to be far more entertaining games out there to play.

UPDATE #2: Had to bump this one back up a bit as it truly is a solid game.  I understand why it held the #1 ranking for so long, although there's many games I like more than it.

UPDATE #3: Continuing to appreciate this more and more. A great role-selection game where timing is everything. Player order is the only thing holding this one back, but nevertheless, an awesome game.

I respect the design of Puerto Rico. The role selection mechanism creates an interesting dynamic and injects some tactical considerations into an otherwise static strategy game. Without the role selection, it'd be too close to Saint Petersburg and its ilk for my liking. Puerto Rico is a lot more interesting, as it's way better at weaving together the effects of player actions. But at heart it's an engine-building game, and I'd rather play San Juan, Race for the Galaxy, or Glory to Rome in this genre, and I only ever find myself requesting Glory to Rome. If I hadn't played any of those games, I suspect I'd like Puerto Rico a lot more than I do. It's a lot drier by comparison. And count me among those who don't like the theme of the game, as abstract as it is.

Not quite a 10: suffers a bit too much from needing players of equal skill level, and seating order bias.

Wonderful Game.  Low player interaction, but that is refreshing as you concentrate on your own progress. Recommended. 

Update: Haven't played for a long time as I have drifted away from this style of game and haven't been tempted to play it.  Score goes from 9 down to 7.5.

Update:  sold it to make way for the likes of Agricola or Le Havre.

This is, of course, a great game.  I have played it numerous times and have actually won a number of times (!!??).  I would give this a higher score but the player interaction I am experiencing with great games like Powergrid, Vegas Showdown, Chinatown, and Giganten, have made me realize there is a player interaction issue with this game for me (i.e, not enough).  I will amost always play this game when in the mood for gaming, but it is not at the very top of the list.  That said, everyone should have a copy of this game.

RATING: 10
About as perfectly executed a game as I've seen.  Just brilliant.  Nearly everyone I've ever introduced Puerto Rico to has become hopelessly addicted -- even family who had only ever played Monopoly, card games, and other light fare jumped right in and loved it.  Intuitive gameplay, balance, and myriad strategic options make this one about as good as gaming gets.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Many different paths to victory and you assume many different roles throughout the game.  Right now, I favor the long-term strategy of producing something expensive, such as coffee, that hopefully nobody else is producing.  I grab a couple quarries early in the game, then use my money for the larger buildings.  I always find Puerto Rico enjoyable, although it doesn't jump off the shelf at me, and I prefer a bit more turn angst. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This was the first game I played with the whole "choose a phase, everyone plays it but you get a bonus" mechanic and also one of the few games I've played with almost no random elements integrated (there is still a small bit with the randomly chosen plantation tiles).

This is a fun, easily picked up game with a good amount of depth and strategy.  I've heard that depth and strategy gets somewhat diluted over time while players start to learn the best and most effective strategies but not many great games can claim that's not true.

RATING: 10
I like the game (like everyone else does!). Simple rules, full of decisions to make and almost no luck at all. 

Puerto Rico happened to be one of mine first board game crushes. This game invented a very important slice of modern board gaming and we all have to respect that as players. I do suspect that a few years from now the willing to play it will decrease as the time passes but that's only because newer things will appear and Puerto Rico, as a lucky free kind of game with no random elements becomes a dry mechanical game resulting in a "obsolete" gaming experience sort of speaking. This is even more true if the group of players remains the same over the years and if the game is played sufficiently to understand all its buildings and characters.

New expansions are needed to fight this cristalisation. I mean, not only new terrains and buildings but also new characters to use and to give new options to players. Maybe it's something that this game deserves.

This is one of the games of my life!

Very close to a perfect game. I wish it could have more random elements, so the games are more different each time (like pirates when shipping cargo, special workers that give you more or less production, etc). But I think is a game that everyone should have and play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A great classic which I still enjoy from time to time. It's still one of the landmarks of the Euro renaissance: tensed, well-oiled, perfect duration, intelligent design. I do have the impression that strategic paths are a bit too predefined, that some buildings are not really interesting and that the game tends to play you as much as you play it, but a great game nevertheless.

Now I've finally played the famous "Puerto Rico", and I think I still prefer "San Juan". I don't think it is a terrible game or anything, it is good and I can see how one can get lost in exploring the different strategies to try and win. My main indicator in liking a game is whether I want to do exactly that, try again no matter how much I got crushed the first time playing (which I did this 1st time) but it doesn't itch me the right way, and therefor I would rather play the shorter and less bloated variant that SJ offers.
I think the design could be a more exciting, too, (I know there is a fancy deluxe edition which I have -0 intention in playing) the writing on the buildings/ plantation was rather small which is annoying for something that is placed in the middle of the table for everyone to read.

Depending on your collection and when you owned this game will probably affect your enjoyment. If it is your first token placement game and/or it's 2002, then this will score 11/10. It is a good game. With other similar games on the market it's hard to keep this as a 10. Still a solid game so I will give it an 8.5. I still recommend playing it though, especially if you're still frustrated from not having at least one more action the last time you played Agricola.

It's fun but I don't like that it was made primarily for 3+ players and not 2. The collusion that can exist makes it not as good as I'd like. Definitely feel that San Juan/Race for the Galaxy is more fun.

RATING: 8
Brilliant game. Highly scalable and interesting mechanics. Only issues I have:
1. Steep learning curve - even if newbies pick up the mechanics, the strategy takes multiple games to grasp.
2. Susceptible to king-making and benefits the player on the left of a newbie.
3. Some buildings are clearly better than others which result in the same few buildings bought each game and others left untouched.
4. Prone to group-think.

Rarely have I been more impressed after playing a game for the first time. Only the late time prevented us from actually playing another game. I like the subtle interaction, the slow development of your plans and love it when things come together. Has a good combination of control and player-generated chaos. I don't play that often (playing any board game hundreds of times is beyond me), so for me, it never feels scripted. And it does really work well with two.

Highly recommended!  Your decisions about which role to play and which buildings to buy cannot be planned beforehand, but rather must be adjusted as you react to the other players&#039; decisions.  While there are opportunities to improve your position each turn, there are also times when you can really louse up an opponent&#039;s plans.  I always want to do more than I&#039;m allowed each turn; this tension in decision making will probably keep the game fresh and addictive for quite some time.

Having recently had cause to revisit it, I am less excited. It's certainly a good game, particularly notable for its including genuinely multiple paths to victory (e.g. shipping, buildings) linked to separate game clocks.

Perhaps the best thing about it (and the worst) is the notoriously strong issue of turn order, where it is vital to follow what other players are doing so as to not give them the game. This is comparatively strong interaction for the genre.

I am less enamored of how scripted the early game can become, the "point salad", and the clunky mishmash of different mechanisms.

An excellent game, but one I no longer think I even need to own.

Puerto Rico was the second game I was introduced to in my board game awakening. I believe I was told that it was like Settlers but better. Such were the categories we worked with. We played it again recently, and it was a nice change of pace.

Over time, as I know the buildings better, I find turn order becomes a big factor not sufficiently balanced in the game design.

This game has a tremendous amount of charm while you're in the process of learning all its ins and outs, and it is standing up brilliantly to an unprecedented number of repeated playings.  It's great how all the small decisions add up to such a rich variety of sequences of events.  Ride the tide of opportunity.

It's really fun with 4 and 5 players. I like how there is minimal luck in this game (Just have to hope that some else will pick up a role that you didn't). One of the harder games to explain to people but so far all of my non gamer friends have liked it. I do not recommend playing it with 3 players, there are better games out there for 3.

RATING: 9
There is no question that Puerto Rico is a superb game that can offer a lot of hours of non-boring play if you are into the resource management euro genre.

It's ease of teaching to new people does not at all imply lack of strategic and tactical depth. It has all the characteristics of a good euro game - important decisions, subtle but very strong player interaction, balance between long term strategy and short term tactics.

It's thin list of disadvantages should probably contain the fact that there are not many valid general strategies once you get to figure the game out and that the elements which make every play unique are not very strong, especially among experienced players. Every play remains unique, but only slightly. In short, it is these points that the designer of Agricola picked up to make an even better game.

RATING: 9
Well now I see what all the fuss is about.  I think this is a great game.  It has lots of decisions to make, requires long-term planning, has a cool theme, is aesthetically pleasing, isn't too difficult to learn, and doesn't take too long to play.  The only minor complaint I have is some of the rules can be a bit confusing at first.  I suggest downloading a list of rules commonly played incorrectly here on the Geek.  I definitely want to play this one some more.

RATING: 9
Needs a few more play to decide whether it is a 10, but so far it has been a blast.  The mechanics are great, but I've been told that the game grows stale after 15 or so playthoughs, so we shall see if that is the case.  This was my gateway game, and though there seems to be many that think this game doesn't work for introducing non-gamers to this hobby, it worked for me.      There seems to be a really vocal minority creating a backlash to the popularity of this game.  Complaints range from it being dry and boring to people using the same strategy every time.  For me, the game is filled with tough, tense, interesting decisions, and so I really don't understand the dry complaint.  And I can't really see the same strategies working too often, to me that just says your play is really weak.  While this is certainly not the perfect game, and it probably isn't the best ever created, it certainly deserves high praise.

Based on many plays.  I think this game really does represent the finest in Euro games.  The game just generates so much strategy discussion and thought. The rules and mechanics fit together better than any other game I have seen.  I have loved this game since it came out and continue to find it enjoyable today after playing it many times.  Even though it doesn't reach the table as often as it used to because there is always so many new games to try, we still find time to play and always enjoy it.

RATING: 8
[RGG 2002 edition] {Merchant, economic; variable-phase, action-draft, development, resource management, utility cards; optimal 4p} Before playing PR, I occasionally play board games, and I was mostly interested in RPG and abstract games. After I played PR, I found that board games can be very interesting and a player can learn different styles of thinking and social style of friends. Since then, I enjoy playing board games much. I could say that PR inspires me about collecting board games.

PR is commonly known as an excellent strategy game, which I do agree. I regard it as the gem of contemporary games: novel mechanic, efficient system, little down time and thematic. PR is cleverly and carefully designed: well balanced, multifaceted, nice player interaction and strong competition.  PR does not offer direct confrontation but the competition is still strong and this creates much indirect player interaction.

The explanation of rule of PR may take a time (mostly explaining the function of different buildings) but the rule itself is not complicated because it's remarkably intuitive; thus, it's easy to understand its concept and game flow. Nevertheless, it takes time to master this game because of multiple paths of winning and variety of strategies. Players have to continually evaluate the situation and make decisions, but it's not as agonizing as other strategic games. PR involves no luck and is quite unforgiving. Since it's a development game, early settings are very important - failing to build a strong foundation will not lead to winning.

I'm the guy you want sitting to your right. ;)  It's a shame that most people are burned out on this. I need to play more. My rating may go up with more plays, but as of now it feels very programmed.

Update: After playing this game with people with similar experience levels, I've increased my rating. Much more fun with people who do not know all of the "perfect" moves. God, this game makes my head hurt.

A great game, but more than any other game I play it suffers from two failings that can make me wary to play it with strangers. Firstly, it seems to attract players who need to tell everyone the 'obvious' action. Secondly, it can be very sensitive to the effects of novice players, and while that doesn't bother me (you win some, you lose some), some other players never stop going on about it.

Very little randomness but I enjoy the interaction between players and trying to maximise my performance at the game. It might be a little dry for some, but for me the theme never disappears while playing. Feels less like a spreadsheet than Agricola and less maths heavy than Power Grid so this one hits the table quite a lot.

Missing out on table time a bit. I suspect we need to get in to this one more as a group so it may come in to it's own more in the future. At the moment it lags behind Power Grid in my affections as a medium-heavy euro, and it's not light enough to challenge Settlers/Carc as more fun/family games.

Tableu building, engine building,worker placement, tile placement, svaka je od ovih kategorija primjenjiva za opis Puerto Rica. Bilo ih je i ranije takvih ali PR ima povijesnu distinkciju kao tipping point prema Euro stilu za mase. Odlična igra, gateway prema igrama euro stila, neki kažu da je potrošna, u mojoj kolekciji (nažalost) nije jer ne dolazi na stol toliko često da bismo automatizirali poteze. Zapravo sad kad razmislim Stone Age, Pillars of the Earth, Caverna pogotovo, pa čak i Manhattan project ili Junta:Viva el Presidente, sve su to 'inačice' Puerto Rica. I to sam nabrojao samo koje su mi prve pale na pamet. Nije mi PR omiljena igra (premda je volim zaigrati tu i tamo) ali kad bih nekome išao pokazati kaj to ovaj hobi jest, definitivno bi bila među prvim igrama koje bismo zaigrali.

I just do not enjoy the drafting mechanic. In this type of game, I would rather be in control of my own destiny instead of having to try and capitalize on the actions that other people select.

Excellent. A great example of a game with a simple mechanic that also requires a great deal of strategy in order to be successful. The balance of play is near perfect. You have to constantly be aware of your opponents' positions within the game and what they're trying to achieve before making your own decisions. There are a number of different strategies you can adopt to be successful in this game, which is one of the reasons it possesses so much re-playability.

If you fall off or are behind the pack it can be quite difficult to come back.  But I love the balancing act.  2004/05/14

One of my all time favourites. The role-choosing mechanic makes every round of this game full of great successes and "oh nooooo" -moments. Takes a few games to grasp what you should really do.

RATING: N/A
A classical, very decent euro-game. I had much of pleasure of analysing opening moves and whole strategies. There is a random element (drawing of plantation tiles) that gives the game replayability. However, after a large number of plays the game could be a little boring, especially as the theme is not strongly connected with mechanics. When playing, you feel like solving an abstract quest, rather than like a governor of San Juan island. But, I must admit, Andreas Seyfarth did his job very well: the gaming system is very solid. 

Personally, I don't like graphics of the standard edition. I made my own game, printing the board designed by Michael Doyle and adding some wooden markers. Respect to Michael, too!


Number of plays: about 5 (plus extra 5-10 with AI).

What I really like about this game is the simplicity and elegance it brings. The fact that having to pick a single action can lead to a difficult decision is fantastic. This game is easy to learn and teach, but difficult to master due to a variety of strategies that it offers. It's not my favourite game, but it's a great game nonetheless.

Nice role-picking game. Set up a good trade commodity and then find a way to ship loads of cheap stuff for points. Monopoly is the key. Or build quickly and end the game before your opponents can get the shipping points. The first turns are super important - one small misstake and there's no easy coming back. Starting player usually picks a quarry, second player builds (small market or small indigo plant), third player bring in colonists. Same thing every time. But then the game really begins...

One of the best of the Euro-games out there.  Nice components, straightforward rules, and an unique system of assigning roles within the game.  Doesn't suffer from the problem that a lot of other Euro's have when it comes to victory conditions.  Victory points are derived from a limited number of sources.

Update - after several plays game is starting to get a little stale.  There are now better Euros out there than when I first wrote this.

RATING: 7.5
An exceptional, standout game when it was released in 2002, and even now it is an excellent game for those looking for a relatively easy to learn, medium complexity Euro.  For me personally, after so many plays, it has become a bit repetitive, as the main strategy for winning is too much about trying to screw your opponent(s) over during the Captain and Trading phases.  Good player interactivity though, the theme is rich, it is "thinky" (in a good way), has superb balance, and it really does feel like you are managing a plantation.  You will definitely be immersed and engaged.  It just has become a little stale and predictable for me and now rarely gets played.  I'd heartily recommend it to newcomers though.

The landmark euro game after Settlers. Decent learning curve, decent setup, decent atmosphere and very well designed strategy and replayability. There have come other games that are suited to the same gaming group since: f.e. Cuba, Agricola and Carson City spring to mind. 

As such, it won't get the playing time it once did, but it's still enjoyable.

I have finished making the illustrated buildings.

I like the easy flow of the game.  There are a good spectrum of strategies to try but are not too dense to figure out.  A Very nice spread of styles and controlling the game end is key.  The interaction is nice and builds a slight tension but not overwhelming.

update : I find myself never reaching for this game. hmm..

update : Just played a 2 player after a long while and completely forgot how to play!  At least the good strategies.  I think I know why I haven't played it in a while.  I just would rather play a more fun 2 p game.

update 2014: Really enjoying this as a two player game.  Raised my rating.  Our familiarity with the buildings has really changed the dynamic.

Not really an economy at work at all. What is is a cardboard story that is inevitably moving toward the end. If you know the right buildings to buy then you can time it right so you'll have more victory pts when the game ends. It does feel a niche in that there are few multiplayer thinky games that are well balanced. Time is maybe a little too long for me but most like it. I dunno maybe it came along at the right time?

It's a debatable topic, but I think this is probably the best game I've played.  There are so many different ways to win and yet it is as well balanced as any game.  It is not particularly light or quick, which might put a few people off, but once you get into it, it's a gem.  The key mechanic to the game is the fact that whatever action you take invariable helps other players too.

Over 50 plays with a consistent group (mostly five player games)later I can't do anything other than recommend this game, highly.

If you think there's not enough player interaction, you can influence the "chain reaction" of production, trading and loading onto the ships by choosing the prospector or a role that benefits anyone but the leader.

+ long playing time (we regularly have >2 hour sessions)
+ different strategies can all pay off (I've seen people winning with a great variety of strategies)
+ components; simply, but work well
+ very little luck involved
+ comebacks are possible, but require planning and determination

We use the improvements suggested by the designer (factory and university cost the other way around, one dubloon(?) less for grain starters.

A decent role selection game. It suffers from solvability somewhat and also, like too may euro games, that if you build a money engine, you'll almost certainly win.

Update: I can see a lot of good things with this game and if it was new and I had a group and we all learnt it together (and improved together), it'd be a lot of fun. As it is, there always seem to be one or two players that have played it a lot and run away with it. For that reason, it's less fun.

Further update: I dislike teaching this to newbies; it is too opaque and so they have little to no idea what to do to win, and they can gift the game unwittingly to someone else.

Rating down from 7 to 6 and down again to 5.

This was one of the first games that was successful with my boardgame re-awakening at the turn of the century.  I learned it with a group of three others and we have played it ever since.

I have had mixed success introducing it to new people as an experienced player does have an advantage, however I can guarantee if I get together with a group of similarly experienced players it will always be a great time.  And if you are picking it up for the first time with others who are just as new - I encourage you to AVOID reading the strategy articles and learn the game with your fellow players.  You won't regret it.

Some minor-to-moderate gameplay imbalances plus poor production values keep this otherwise very good and innovative game from 'perfect 10' status.

The late-2011 release Puerto Rico 10th Anniversary Edition version corrects most of the production value deficiencies (with the glaring exception of the US version's 'copper-instead-of-gold-looking' doubloons... tsk), but does nothing to clean up any gameplay flaws. 

It's also quite steeply priced, i.e. almost triple what you can pick up the old version for.

The amazing thing about Puerto Rico is that there is never downtime for any player.  Players take turns selecting an action to take, and every player takes that action in succession.  So, while you do wait your turn to select an action, you will always be taking actions based on what other people select.  I rate this one very highly because the strategy and strategic depth found in this game is simply delicious.  It's not too complex to learn, but a challenging game to master.  A near perfect, and at this point a classic, euro-style game.

Consider your first game of this a write-off. Generally new players tend to spend the first half of the game trying to grasp the many subtle things going on or even clue into the games flow. I find pretty much everyone I've introduced it to REALLY enjoyed it by the end and totally was up for another game of it.

Addendum: Enjoyed further games much more, had a better grasp of why I wanted buildings, what they could do for me. Everyone did their own little thing and played the game differently using different strategies, yet we all came out pretty close at the end (tied for first actually), that being said it seems very very well balanced. It's an interesting game; mind you the lack of player interaction and a fairly low fun factor makes it less then perfect but its pretty god damn close! 

Addendum: Lots of plays, freaking grand game.  Endless possibilities and every changing strategy.  Love the game, HATE teaching it to new players.

I've been a bit harsh towards this game as of the last 6  months because it turns out it's the only one people want to learn or play. So for several months we'd only play Puerto Rico, which made me come to dislike it (since it cut into the time I had for other games)
However, if I were to do a fair rating based on the play value, I would say that yes, it deserves a score of 8.4

This game is brand new, sealed and in stock. 

Puerto Rico from Rio Grande Games Ages: 12+ Players: 3-5 Avg. Length: 90-150 minutes

This is the game of colonizing and crop production. Players vie to win by a combination of building their colony buildings and shipping the most goods. Great strategy game with many routes to victory. My personal favorite boardgame

A quintessential game, dinged only by the fact that so many gamers have overplayed (100s, even 1000s of games on BSW) and overanalyzed it that they never want to play (particularly in a face-to-face environment).  One of my favorites, and always will be.

Revised September 2009, from 9.5 to 10 - I feel this deserves to join my one other "10", RA.  I planned my trips to PAX the last two years around the fact that Puerto Rico tournaments were taking place.  That means something significant to how much I enjoy this game.

#7 big box series
This is a classic with lots of choices and a lot of "I wish I could do A and B and C". Unfortunately, it has been played and analyzed to death. This is one that is best played by folks with the same amount of experience with the game, otherwise things become quickly lopsided. The other issue I have is that there are a bazillon bits and its a bit fiddly to deal with the pieces. I actually prefer the computer version, which I can play in roughly 15 minutes.

After some online play, I've decided I just don't care for this game. Each game feels the same and I don't care for what seems like very stale choices each turn. A player that doesn't know the game throws it to the person following them. When everyone knows the game well, the choices are very limited and it just isn't a fun game.

Rating after first play.  Finally managed to get it on the table with my group (who are all, including myself, mostly wargamers in spirit).  Noone raved about it, but everyone had fun.  I'm not sure how often we'll pull it out, and I'm not sure how much replayability it really has generally, but PR is undeniably an interesting and meaty game.

I like this a lot, as do so many others. Not much to add but I do see the day when it will dry up on me.

RATING: 8
My group has not had the chance to analyze Puerto Rico to death, so we are still exploring the depths of this game.  I love the plethora of varied decisions you must make during the course of a single game, such as Do I take the Settler for a quarry now while I have a chance, or the Prospector which would give me two doubloons and wouldn't help anyone else?  Or do I build the Small Warehouse now before they're gone, or save up for the Coffee Roaster?  Which boat do I use for my indigo, and when does taking the Craftsman ever help me more than even one other person?  And on and on.  Puerto Rico is a fun, deep, and varied game.

While still respected in our gaming group, Puerto has fallen out of the regular rotation due to the programmatic nature of the gameplay after so many sessions. There's maybe 10% of any given session that feels novel from other sessions, but it's still fun to take for a spin now and again.

Finally, after a month of gathering dust on the shelf, my gaming group gave it a go. This is a good and fast paced game. Despite all the complexity, from the second governor's turn on the game started flowing nicely. 
Excellent game with almost nonexisting downtime. It requires thinking about both long term strategy and short term tactics.
Virtually no luck element, except of the plantation choice - but this has an overall minuscule effect on the gameplay. It's all headology!

Trounced from previous 10 to 9 after discovering LeHavre.

My go to game. If you haven't search around for the Puerto Rico Evolver. Best board game to MS Excel port ever.

The things I love about this game are that the randomization doesn't really effect the game much (plantations) and that there are truly MANY ways to win. I recently saw someone win using a Hospice/Office strategy. I would have NEVER thought that would work.

The only downside to the game is there are a few improperly balanced buildings like the lighthouse which costs too much and the small market that costs too little.

What's to say that hasn't already been said?  After playing again for the first time in a while, I've been reminded of how good this game is.

One of the most remarkable things about this game is that while it's more complex than anything non-gamers have played, they still take to it *really* well.

I've picked it back up again thanks to BSW and the Alea Treasure Chest; I like it with the first expansion, but I haven't gotten a chance to play with the nobles yet. I think they may add an interesting twist to the game.

I like the optimization aspect of this game very much. I have difficulties with the role selection aspect. This is the most challenging aspect of the game, and for me the true advantages and disadvantages of the roles are too hidden somehow. This is probably the depth that most PR fans enjoy.

About the players' boards: a) they're identical--each person has his own San Juan.  There should have been variety, to spice it up, but it was probably an economic decision.  b) I feel like I should be doodling on a placemat but I have no crayons, and I'm wondering what to order from a waitress who never appears.  We're competing, yes, but we're isolated from each other, sequestered on our little, private playing boards.  It makes me feel there's an element of community missing from the playing of the game.

I want to give this game a lower score, but I'm having trouble managing to.  I think there are a lot of much better games.  But where PR does do a good job, is in making a game of building-up your own stuff and yet interacting fairly well with the other players.  This is something I have to say PR does better than Goa.  In Goa basically everyone could decide to focus on spices and ships first.  With the Colonies and plantations it wouldn't be too hard.  In PR you do need to think about what the other players are doing and do something else -- ideally, something that complements their activities perfectly.

I need to be better at this game. I like it quite a bit and while the 2 Hacienda thing is annoying, I'm sure there must be some type of strategy to beat this. Unlike Agricola, I enjoy this game and would like improve my skills at it.

It's a good game, but just hasn't captured my attention. I'm happy to play, but I can't see myself suggesting it. There are other similar games that I enjoy more. It reminded me a bit of Yspahan in that it's mechanically solid, but just very dry feeling.

This is the first game since settlers that we had to play 3 times in a row the night we opened it.  It compelled us to try again.  I KNEW I could do better if I just had one more chance.  The game was learned easily.  Our fist game ironed out a few rule bugs but otherwise went smooth.  Fantastic game.

One of my favorite games. I absolutely love the role selection mechanic, and Puerto Rico still does it better than anybody. You're always engaged on every player's turn, the competition can be fierce for ship space and buildings, and you get to build a nice engine that can be different every time (production, shipping, buildings). Just great.

This is the game that made me fall in love with BGG.  When I first got into gaming towards the end of high school (2003-2004) my brother had a copy of Settlers of Catan which we played to death.  That year I wanted to get some board games for Christmas. So, I went on BGG, found the rankings, and asked for every game in the top 10.  I got this under the tree and discovered my first truly elegant game design.  I love that there is no luck only your own skill and wits.  This game frequently fights with Agricola for my #1 eurogame spot.

One of the first games I ever picked up when I was entering the hobby and I still enjoy it now, well over a decade later.  If I have a complaint, it's that I seem to be unable to play the game without ending up with the factory and trying to get all five production buildings and the guild hall.  (Then again, I win my fair share or more, so maybe it's a good strategy?)

The role imbalance and selection is the coolest thing here and it is executed really well. It essentially plays like multiplayer chess which has its pros and cons. Really fun but AAAAHHH ROUND COLONISTS. I'm also bad at it. Sometimes better to play on BSW, unless I had the deluxe version.

RATING: 7.8
Having played this game a few times now recently, I am loving it more and more. The brutality and counter picking is very prominent once you pick up the mechanics and its rare to see such interaction in a lot of Euro's now a day.

After playing a few games with newbies I had to lower my rating just a bit. Its not that I didn't appreciate the game less, and I love teaching games to new peoples, the presence of a new player is such a bolster on the person right after them. I just need to adjust my expectation for the game when playing with a new person and adjust accordingly.

Rating based on two tabletop plays so far. Not as painful as I expected but then I play with a very laid back group!  Very neat mechanics, of course, but it can be quite dull; it's not exciting or particularly interesting although it was certainly more satisfying on a second play...I'd try it again but I'm not in a hurry.

RATING: 9
There's a reason this game has been in the top 3 for a long time. It deserves it for its impeccable balance and incredibly interesting decision-making throughout every play.

I keep it at a 9.5 (and not a 10) simply because teaching it to players who are not familiar with role-selection games is a bit of a task. And it usually takes a new player a few games before it clicks.

For the record, the "click" is totally worth every minute you spend learning this gem. This is my #1 game of choice.

UPDATE: I have since matured a bit in my gaming, I suppose, because I no longer find this game a challenge to teach new players. Or I've played it enough that I know how to teach it better. Probably a combo of the two. Also, PR is no longer my game of choice. In this stage of the game, I go with Through the Ages as my top pick. I'll probably keep this at a 9, however, because while it is elegant, streamlined, balanced, and interesting, it does not offer the depth of play as something like Through the Ages. It's probably still in my Top 3 games.

This is a good game and I would certainly play it more if it was shorter. That being said, a lot of the fun went out of it for me when all of the strategies were put up here at BGG. Another BGGer said it well when he said that it became a game with right and wrong moves, proper and improper opening sequences, etc. Chess is not my thing for this very reason. I enjoyed Puerto Rico when I faced decisions and I felt like there were several good options. Now, it feels like there's a best move and everything else is suboptimal.

Very exciting game to learn, as there are so many possible paths to victory.  With only a dozen plays under my belt, I am still uncertain about many strategies, which is a fun place to be.  I like its level of complexity - several stages to get your economy up and running, but not so many that the game lasts forever.  I love the role-choice mechanic, where everyone takes the action, but the chooser gets a privilege in addition.

Rules seem more complex at first than they are, due primarily to the huge number of pieces and the variety of boards, so new players may need to be assured that everything makes sense.  Rules are logical and gameplay is buttery smooth. Can't wait to play more.  
UPDATE: I've now played a couple games with two players, and this is an amazing experience.  I really enjoy the game, even though I seem to completely stink at it.  I find it still remains a bit intimidating to a new player due to the number of pieces, but this is an easy mental barrier to break through.  I've had much luck teaching this to people new to the hobby.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is a great game.  I like Race for the Galaxy a bit more, but that's just because I prefer tactical decision-making to strategic decision-making.  The interaction here is more straight-forward (since others can't choose the same role, and your decisions have a more immediate effect).  Although long-term strategies seem to be more in the fore-front, there is definitely a need to think on your feet, in everything from deciding what to ship, to which role to take after the previous player took my intended choice.  Lots of fun, definitely looking forward to learning how to play better.

Definitely deserving of the award. After having played this game many times I've come to enjoy it even more. If you're looking for a game in which the mechanics are complex enough for a 'gamer' yet not mind numbingly so, all players are constantly involved, luck plays only a very small part, the successful strategies are many and varied, the backstabbing is veiled yet decisive, and most games end with even casual players wanting 'another go', then look no further than Puerto Rico.

Most of my recent plays have been the computer version, which I really enjoy (but I don't record those plays).

It's hard for me to find flaws in this game.   The mechanics are fairly straighforward, yet provide enough depth in each turn.   There is a sharp learning curve that usually doesn't become apparent until near the endgame.    A favorite for me, and my wife loves it too.

Once you graduate from Settlers of Catan (an excellent game in its own right), you're ready to face a more complex European-style game like Puerto Rico. It is colorful, it has an interesting setting (plantations in America), and many things to keep track of (farming, trading, building, slave-- er, "colonist" management, etc.) There is also a streamlined card-only version called "San Juan".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a very good strategy game based on exclusive role selection, but it has a big flaw. Usually it's not the best player who decides who wins, but the worst player. In most cases sitting behind the player that makes the most sub optimal choices will bring you the win.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An excellent game that I enjoyed an awful lot when I first got it.  That said, I'm not sure I agree with it being truly phenomenal.  Certain flaws are just so glaring (the utter uselessness of certain buildings) that one must wonder for all the rest of its design genius, how these could have been missed.  That and the fact it breaks down with players of highly differeing skill levels prevents it from getting a higher rating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
There are two things I'll never understand in this life: Why people like smoking and why people love Puerto Rico.

This is a eurogame that crossed the line and is hardly a game: 
1) Boring concept almost totally disconected to the mechanics. Other games have no concept at all you might add, BUT : 
2) It has terrible player interaction mainly because it depends heavily on how the players sit, 
3) You need to force-play at least 3-4 games to realise that the mechanics are good and at least 6-8 games to start making some strategic and sensible choices. Now Combine this to 
4) The game plays crap with people that don't know what they're doing (meaning they're still below 6-8 games) and you get a fail.

If you want to enjoy this you need to find a group of at the very least 3 people that are willing to waste 15-20 hours of their life without enjoying themselves + risk that 1)They won't like it even after that, 2)They will hate it long before they'll get a chance to like it and quit the painfull process.

Even if everything goes right you'll have a few people trained to play a game that has excellent mechanics and little else. (although some of us would argue that mechanics is 90% of a game) 

------

+ Excellent mechanics (role selection, engine building)
+ Tough Decisions
+ Little Downtime
+ Fair Replayability
+ No luck

- "Bad" Interaction (poor choices mostly benefit others instead of ruining just you)
- Barely working theme
- Boring until you figure what's going on

What I like: 

-Classic eurogame and it's quite fun to build your distinct part of the island

What I do not like:

-I really really dislike the action selection mechanic where everyone has to do each others' stupid action. I know folks say that means you have to look at the opponents situation and evalute what their next move is, but that is exactly what I hate. This means that to play optimally I should actually spent more time looking at your board than my own. Not to mention the fact that sometimes you are stuck with the strategy you chose early game (for instance builder) and some idiot at the table hasn't realised that he is spoon feeding my other opponent the victory by constantly picking the craftman. This could also be the other way around. Generally the problem is just the result of my strategy is based primarily on what my opponents decide to do (and who is more experienced and where they sit on the table versus the newer players).
-It's definitely not a pretty game.

Its good.  After much avoiding and disdain after my first play, once I immersed myself into the depth of the game, there is some quality.  Good player interaction.  Pretty gosh darned good.  Once I removed myself from the series of tactical moves, and focused on an overall strategy carried out by tactical moves, the light went off inside my head and this became quite enjoyable.

Played again after a long layoff.  This game holds up as a classic.

There's a lot of talk on here on 'the geek' about how this is still #1 becuase of OLD ratings.  THIS rating here is a revisit of mine on 01-01-2008 so with a fresh mind and thought on the game I say...keep it as one of the 3 games I have rated a 10.  This game is still more than worthy of it's #1 spot on the geek and I for one hope it stays put.  Don't be haters.

UPDATE. OK So the game got unseated by Agricola. I personally feel this is the right call. Agricola is a better game in all honesty. Still PR rocks.

Everything in this game seems so balanced, none of the buildings seem overpowered and none seem useless. If the look of the game was nicer I would score this game a perfect 10. This is one of my all time favorite medium to heavy games and its in my personal top 10. Best with 4 players.

What can be said about Puerto Rico that hasn't already been said?  Not much.  I was blown away by this game the first few times I played it.  The role selection mechanism is ingenious.  I think everyone should play this game at least a few times in their lives.  While it may not be for everyone, it's certainly worth trying to see if it's for you.

There is a very nice game engine here even if it is just another "victory point machine" game.  I've played this quite a lot and it still feels reasonably fresh when I come back to it, so that has to count for something.

"Colonists" are brown tokens, arriving to work plantations. Slaves. I'm really not sure I want to be glorifying the triangle trade.

The gameplay is good, but that aspect unsettled me enough that I got rid of my copy. It'd be be a 1 if this weren't such an otherwise solid game.

I've gone from really liking this game, to it being one that my gaze sort of slides over on the shelf... The rating has dropped from 10 to 8 to 6.  The problem is my game group has devotees who have played so much, they just know all the ropes.  They know exactly what they should be doing for every move and how it will help them.  It all seems so mechanical.  I just don't like to play any one game so repetitively that I become mechanical...

Strong Mechanics. One of the better multi-player games. But it rewards a passive play and not an aggressive strategy. Also you need to know the different buildings which is a problem for new players.Also after you play it a couple of times, the game has only few well described strategies.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The reason I have given this game a seven is.. it is a game not about building up your empire, but ensuring that the guy after you will NOT benefit as much you on your action (the less the better). This makes the game a little less enjoyable than the mechanics should predict.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I love the different strategies that can be employed, and that everyone gets to act on everybodys turn.  There is almost zero downtime.  The only things keeping this from being a 10 for me is the annoying setup and the ending.  The ending stinks for 2 reasons.  The first is that if someone wants to end the game, you can't do anything to stop them.  The second is that the ending feels very unnatural and abrupt.  Everything between the setup and the ending though is excellent.  Edit: whatever its a 10

After two months of owing this, have *finally* played a game!  And it wasn't even my copy we used.. :/

Undecided.  I normally like the resource management & strategy style game; Power Grid is my all-time fave.  Perhaps being whipped by all the others didn't help.  I know I wasn't that efficient, but that surprised me.  Perhaps I can blame it as sitting to the left of a very good player (Brett)!

I really need to play this more..!

Puerto Rico is a low luck game, where you want to select roles that help yourself but more importantly don't help your opponents.  You are building buildings which grant you abilities and VPs and turning goods into money/points.  It can be a little dry.

Finally played this, 4p. Was nervous to try it because of the higher than average "weight," but it's actually pretty easy to play, just a little fiddly. It feels most like AOE3 and Endeavor, of games I've played. You work on building up an economy that produces gradually more and more of desirable stuff. Direct player interaction seems lower because of no map, but indirect interaction is more visible than in Endeavor. What you do will affect others, but can be hard to think through.

Labor feels less scarce in PR. Money feels scarce, because you don't have a steady income. The shipping is the most interesting part of the game, where you can really bone somebody. I considered trying San Juan instead of PR due to it being simpler, but as I hear SJ lacks shipping, I'm glad I went straight to PR.

It may be due to my inexperience, but strategy felt pretty short-term to me. I look at what I could most use at the moment, and attempt to improve that. Like Endeavor, but with less random outcomes to my choices, and more concern about what the other players are going to do if I take certain actions.

At the end of the day, I don't think I'm that interested in these economy-building games.

...Revisited many months later. I don't think I missed much except that the different combinations of buildings allow for some exploration of the strategy. Not just the long-term strategy but also a lot of the appeal of the game is probably located there.

I still feel like I'm making tiny moves, and am supposed to calculate whether I shouldn't make a tiny move because it will let somebody else make a slightly less tiny move.

One of the best true strategy games out there, this game leaves little to chance. One of the most important considerations in this game is you have to think how picking an action may benefit your rivals. It can be a struggle at times as exchanging goods for money/victory points is restricted and without some planning you can end up feeling a little redundant. For this reason the game can feel a little slow at times but still enjoyable.

Excellent game. The only thing that prevents it achieving a 10 rating is the effect of player seating order. This can represent a drawback in a mixed group. Otherwise, it's fantastic. The two-player Alea variant is excellent as well.

Great game, loads of depth, I find something new every time I play - usually about five seconds after I've done something stupid and realise what I *should* have done!

Can feel a little bit scripted, especially with on-line players with hundreds of games under their belts who have a "right" sequence of moves the game "should" follow.

My "gateway" game from Fluxx and company to heavier fare, Puerto Rico has always provided me a fun game with many different routes for victory, and, especially with the expansion, room for surprises.

I have to side with the masses on the geek and declare this to be a perfect game. I don't play it much (and I never overplayed it when it was the hot thing) so I have a long way to go in learning the insides of this one. Should stick around for a long time.

what is funny is that this remains a 10 game even though I cant muster enough love to put it on my top 10. it is a top tier game in respect but it doesn't go straight to the heart.

I can see the criticisms of the game, as there are many decisions you feel you "have to do" but I disagree that it is scripted. Every buying phase lets people choose their own fate.

While I think the game is very balanced and has good mechanics, there's just something about it that makes we not ever want to suggest playing it.  However, I also won't walk away from a game of it.  The game experience is much lower if you have experienced and new players playing together.  The new players can basically give the game away to the people on their left and unless you table talk the game there's nothing you can do to stop it.  More minor problems of PR are that you have perfect information and therefore the game plays you more than you play the game.  Your best choice of action is pretty much always apparent and you can also predict what most players are going to do on their turn.  You also have the problem of having only one strategy in PR work:  MONEY EARLY - VPs LATE.  Following that overall strategy, you have the problem on only two paths to victory:  Building or Shipping.  OF course you have different tactics to choose from to accomplish those paths, but it's still only two paths and one strategy.  I also think the game is dry and not FUN!  I can see why people like it, but it just doesn't grab me like better games.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
he players are plantation owners in Puerto Rico in the days when ships had sails. Growing up to five different kind of crops—corn, indigo, sugar, tobacco, and coffee—they must try to run their business more efficiently than their close competitors: growing crops and storing them efficiently, developing San Juan with useful buildings, deploying their colonists to best effect, selling crops at the right time, and, most importantly, shipping their goods back to Europe for maximum benefit.

The game system lets players choose the order of the phases in each turn by allowing each player to choose a role from those remaining when it is their turn. No role can be selected twice in the same round. The player who selects the best roles to advance their position during the game will win.

An innovative, well-designed game that I greatly enjoyed exploring ten years ago (and would have rated a 9 when it first came out) and which I no longer play.

PR does lots of things right: its underlying strategic tension between shipping and building is spot on; mostly, the buildings are priced well; and the different ending conditions work nicely.

However, its "pressuring" style of interaction (where each player mostly constrains and biases the choices of their left-hand neighbor, inducing very strong left/right binding) is far too strong, imo.

The winning strategy all too often, especially in 5-player games, is to simply sit to the left of the weakest player. PR really needs all of its players to be equally strong; its core action mechanism simply isn't robust in the face of different skill levels.

Further, its extremely low level of randomness leads to overly stylized play.  Attempting to be creative (if the given "expected" readout of future moves doesn't favor you) leads to far more second-guessing, acrimony, and criticism than I enjoy.

Frankly, I'd rather play Diplomacy, a far more enjoyable game for the level of acrimony I've experienced playing PR. Two of the most painful gaming experiences I've had in the last 10 years have involved PR. Yes, obviously, this is primarily the fault of the players involved, but I also think that the game system lends itself to it.

For two better, more recent and more enjoyable games, in this general vein of no-luck "pressuring" interaction, consider Navegador (where the strong left-right binding of the markets is tempered by the timing considerations induced by the rondel) or Hansa Teutonica (if you can get past the dreadful theming and bland presentation of the base game -- the expansion maps make far better historical sense and play better).

Puerto Rico is fun and "peaceful" (at least with my wife :) )game to play. Players usually just play their own game. Not a lot of interaction on this. Still so many possibilities and so many routes to win. Every game is so different. Thats cool.

Graduated from San Juan to the big daddy.  Ugh.  Feels like accounting.  Has player-order and groupthink issues.

If PR were a HS science class, I'd be sitting at the back of the room, huffing gas and making spitballs with my buddies. It'd be a relief to finally get kicked out.

I'd rather play DVE, or San Juan, or ItYotD, or AoI, or Railroad Tycoon, or....

On the plus side, there are things I admire about this game. I like the theme. I like how the roles and their special priviledges are defined with such a brilliant simplicity. On the other hand, the turn order binding can be very aggravating sometimes.  I can be especially frustrating being next to an inexperienced player.

You MUST (eventually) get the expansion, otherwise this game gets repetitive.  The expansion adds enough variety that your favorite strategy won't always work, or at least you'll have to go at it a different way.  Vanilla PR is still fun for many plays before this problem emerges though.

A favorite for everyone. Will play it all the time if asked. Game has been fully analyzed and talked about. We enjoy the multitude of variability of this game and the flexibility of changing strategies half way through the game. However, a superior player will generally beat an inferior player and this is an issue since our groups are always a combination of both

A classic that I still enjoy playing after over 50 plays.  I love the different strategies and still haven't explored all the different buildings.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
One of the very best - I love it! I prefer to play with four (experienced) players, and after that with three players. With five players, there is not enough control to the game IMHO. Also, it is best to play with an experienced group. But when you put these shortcomings aside, you can just enjoy the elegance :)

2011 edit: lowered the rating from 10 to 9. Although it is highly elegant masterpiece, it feels at the same time already a bit old-fashioned. Especially on the re-playability side (the games have been evolved especially on this, I think). There just seems to be too little variation and you end up buying almost the same buildings each game. Nowdays, it just doesn't feel enough to learn just the nyances of a game, unfortunately...

Used to be a 10, but got overplayed and without any great variation in set up the group I played went for the same strategy every time. Familiarity bred contempt and the rating crashed to 7.

After blowing many years' worth off dust of the box, two plays brought its rating up to 8.5, but the flaws, I realised, are still there so it has dropped slightly to whatever bizarre rating it presently has.

RATING: 5
Lowering to a 5 from a 7. Kind of lost its luster after several plays as there's only so many strategies. It's a perfect game for getting someone off of Catan or Ticket to Ride and is still pretty interesting, but it begins to feel like playing the same game after a dozen or so plays.

At some point I started feeling like I solved the game, which became a huge deterrent for wanting to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This game does not feel elegant to me; the rules seem a touch fiddley and contrived to me.  That's not a bad thing, it just disqualifies it for "elegance".  The rules are not excessive, and they felt more managable on this play.

I didn't rate this game after my first play because I barely knew what I was doing.  I feel like I have a better handle on it after several more plays, but they have been infrequent enough that I don't really know all the buildings very well.  I really want to learn the ins and outs of this game on my own, so I am avoiding any serious strategy discussions about it.  It just doesn't sound like fun to follow the "best moves" in every case, and I hope the reports of it being scripted are overblown.

Fortunately, the times I have played it have been with my normal group is similarly minded people.  I think having some PR jackoff tell me that I ruined his game because I didn't play the way they expected would really put me off the game.  As it is, I like the game pretty well, but don't find it stellar.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Really liked this game the first few plays, would have been a 9. After 8 plays, since I play 2 player using official Alea variant, it's getting a tad bit repetitive. With more players I am sure its rating will be higher.

Update: It is quite fun and I am getting some re-playability out of it so far. It is quite relaxing to play.

RATING: 8.5
This is a smart game.  It can be taught relatively easily. I'd recommend teaching how a round works and explaining each role with one sentence like *With Builder, you spend gold to build in your city* then proceed with actual gameplay. How each role works is better understood through play than explanation.  A more extreme suggestion is to NOT include purple buildings and quarries for a player's first game.

Puerto Rico has interesting tactical options and different methods of advancement.  A neat bonus is that nobody *runs away* with the score, the ranges between player scores is low.  My only complaint is that it takes too long to get going (having individual baggies for 3, 4 and 5 players is a good idea!) and the initial struggling is painful.

There are two minor problems here: a), what the kool kids call "left-right binding", and b) burnout, from playing the game a lot and having all the basic strategic avenues memorized.  But really, that is all just so much nitpicking (and the expansion helps with issue b, anyway). Just about everything this game *does*, from the economic engine to the city-building aspect to the two dimensions of draftable and purchasable variable player powers, are all excellent as far as I'm concerned.

Typical euro with some interesting mechanics. Small text and small pieces so its difficult to read the board. If you do enjoy euros you'll probably enjoy this game. The theme isn't too strong as some things that happen make no sense at all. 

I dislike these types of games because unless you're able to study and fully understand the entire game you have no chance at competing with others. While learning the game you'll ruin it for everyone else by setting up players with advantages because you didn't take the appropriate move. Might as well play it solo as there is really no player interaction.

Our first game (5 newbies!) was a disaster, but after getting some experience we've really enjoyed this. A little vulnerable to overanalysis (clearly, the way that some people seem to have "solved" the game backs up this point... I will never play this at a con). Lots of decisions to make - deciding which buildings to build, which roles to select and when. With more plays the decisions have gotten somewhat easier, but it still makes me think hard. It seems to be good to have a main strategy in mind, but because you can't always get the plantations you want, you don't have unlimited freedom in setting that strategy. Deserves its high ranking.

Solid, balanced, engaging Eurogame.  Resource and turn role management.  Everyone is always engaged since what you choose to do, everyone else can do as well.  Reasonably quick game (about 1hr or so).  There is definitely a reason why this game was #1 on BGG for so long.  Very deserving.

I can definitely see how influential Puerto Rico has been on the gaming world, but I wouldn't call it one of my personal favorites. 

It's a good game, but I don't care for having to count out all of the victory points and colonists in a less than five-player game. It's a fairly deep game that I luckily don't play with people who know exactly what the best move always is. Absolutely brilliant game that I'll play when in the right mood, but it's arguably over-hyped and outdated.

I can't really understand the high rating this game gets on boardgamegeek.
The mechanics are identical to "Agricola" and dull in the same way.
Almost no player-interaction, everyone just stares at his small board.
Why are such boring games so popular? I just can't get it.
My rating is a 3, I don't want to play again.

Absolute classic that plays like a dream and involves some deep thinking. Production quality is not good: Flimsy cardboard, undecorated building cards etc. It does get a bit stale after a number of plays because of the limited building selection, so we prefer to play with the extra buildings.

RATING: 8.5
Pros: original variable role selection mechanic with tableau building, highly tactical with nearly no luck, balanced strategies, engine building, little downtime

Cons: no direct player interaction, sometimes prone to kingmaking, little variability in initial set-up without expansions

Love this classic, unique variable role selection/resource management game. The fact that everyone does the role chosen means there is nearly zero downtime. Though some may complain that there is too little player interaction, in order to succeed, one absolutely must examine their opponents' boards to not only optimize your own role selection but also predict what other players will do and plan accordingly. I enjoy this level of player interaction as well as creating my own economical engine. On that note, the strategies are so finely balanced across the board, I can try something one game and win, and then try something completely different the next time and do just as well. Finding the right balance of shipping and building is pure delight, and each game is different, even without the buildings expansions.

RATING: 8
"Gamer's game" with almost no hidden information. Players vie to collect the most victory points by carefully managing their resources to build plantations, make and ship goods, and obtain buildings that improve their assets. The most interesting mechanic is the role selection: players choose a role based on what remains available to them - each is valuable but can only be selected once per turn. The catch is that all players still get to perform the same action without given bonus. The game thus centers around careful role selection by taking into account your game standing but also considering the position of others. Solid medium-complexity game with broad appeal, as attested by its long standing #1 position on BGG.

After 2 plays - it&#039;s good, but is it that good?  Several games later - I am convinced.  Very good game which I cannot for the life of me work out how to play well, and one of those very addictive games you want to play again even if you&#039;ve just played it.

This game, along with Power Grid and Tigris & Euphrates, takes 2 hours to play, and so I rarely play it because these days I don't like being trapped in a game for more than an hour. I'd rather play several shorter games than one long one. Hence, I don't recommend these games for anyone but the most serious board gamers, even though they are excellently designed and get the highest rankings. 

In fact, a shorter, card game version of Puerto Rico was released, called San Juan (2004), with a rating of 7.32, and ranked 152 in board games and 159 in strategy games, that most of my friends who love Puerto Rico prefer, because San Juan takes less than half the time to play.

Brilliantly balanced game of timing, timing, timing. I think it's best as a two-player game so you can focus just on one other player and have a lot of control over the flow of the game. I'm still uncomfortable with the game's representation of colonization and slave trade.

Suffering thru the first game -- could hardly wait for it to end. Components look like an unfinished prototype, or an advanced print and play, depending on your point of view.. There's a fan art update.. if I liked the game, I'd make it (it's gorgeous).

It would be great actually, if folks would honestly re-rate the game, after dumping it (just to balance out all of the 'love' this homely collection of cardboard and undersized and over supplied bits gets).

RATING: 6
I think this game doesn't do well with tactical play like most other games do.  I play almost exclusively tactically with no long-term plan - which works very well with almost all games, actually, but not here.

I think this contributes to my dislike of the game.  I feel like I don't "get" it, and this throws me off when I catch on to almost all other games quickly.  However, this may mean there is more to discover and learn from playing more, so I make have to give it a few more tries.

1st update (Sep 2010)[8]: I find that it can suffer a bit from optimal play; if someone on the table just throws at random actions, the game suffers as a whole. I still like it for what it is though. 

2nd update (Dec 2010)[7]: Recent plays has seemed nearly mechanical and lifeless. For some that's probably a good thing, but I would like some options/multiple paths. Suffers a LOT from position around the table.

3rd update (Feb 2012)[8]: Back up to an eight. I think I had played it too much when I wrote the last update. I feel myself yearning to play recently, and it is a really good game!

Excellent blending of various game mechanisms which never comes out the same way twice. Still there is something missing for me here. That said I can certainly see why someone would love it. There is much here that is commendable and enjoyable. My feelings for this game change so frequently. Why does it seem like the first player to get one of the largest buildings wins? Still, despite my changing feelings, I keep playing. And with this many possible strategies, how could I not? The answer is simple: sometimes, I am not in the mood to play it.

Hi Puerto Rico! Big fan here. So, I love your relatively easy rules, your fantastic game flow, the short downtime, and your depth. I hate your theme. 

I don't do this often, but I give you permission to go full monopoly. Release a new theme every year, saturate the market. I will buy you. Release Puerto Rico in space, Puerto Rico: X-Men, Puerto Rico: Zombie Apocalypse. It's alright. Your theme isn't that integral to game play and if you dress yourself a little differently it will be easier to introduce you to my friends.

A modern classical in the gaming scene.

I like the different strategies (sadly mainly only just two) and it's tactical choices.
What I dislike a bit are various buildings which have mostly no real impact to the game. I rarely see a university build.
Building could use a rework - having tried the expansion from the spielbox I know there are different possiblities to enhance the game.

The flaw with the buildings is the reason this is no 10 but 0.5 short of it for me.

I get it's why it's popular but for all of its pluses --and there are many-- I just don't find it to be terribly fun. Maybe if I had discovered it with everyone else ... before the key strategies gelled and became second nature to everyone else. 

That said, it has that special something that will keep me playing it until I figure out how to win once or twice.

PR is a classic and pretty fun.  It's a bit complicated to explain to new players.  I find it a bit difficult to employ strategy in PR as, especially with 3 or more players, it becomes hard to figure our what the BEST move might be.  As such, people make mistakes because there seem to be several moves that all look equally good.  This makes this game very fun.

I've played Puerto Rico a lot and haven't gotten to the point where the game feels too "predictable" to me.

Excellent and addicting game.

I don't see what all the fuss is about.  Okay game, but really dry.  Requires several games before any of the strategy appears.  Doesn't deserve the rating it has.  Theme doesn't help.  Every time I bring it out I have to apologize for the little brown "colonists" that come over on ships and tend your fields.  My friends are smart enough to recognize colonial exploitation of slavery when they see it, and also smart enough to be offended by this game glossing over it as though it never happened.

I have played five games, and the game seems to be good. There might be a little bit too much optimization for me, but if nobody is optimizating too much, the game is quite enjoyable. Good game with fast players, elegant, simple and so on. But also a game that I would not like to teach for newbies or non-gamers.

Updated after seventh play, still no victories. The game is okay, but I can't make a tactic for it and end up just doing this and that, which is of course no winning strategy. One reason might be, that I only play this once a year or so. :)

Eighth play got me a victory while sitting next to two newbies in a five player game. But I had some tactics myself, and managed to points by myself as well.

Oh I really enjoy this game. It was a bit difficult to learn. Read the manual twice, Watched Scott's Board Games tutorials on Youtube and then played with a friend who knew what they were doing. When we teach it we get a lot of deer in the headlights looks. Once you learn, it is a lot of fun. Developing a good strategy takes time. I don't win this game very often. Sigh.

I am just stunned every time I play this game at the balance of the game.  I don't know how Andreas figured out all the ratios and what not but this is just a finely tuned and, yes, an elegant game.  It is also simply a ton of FUN to play.  Love it.  Having said that, after many many plays the luster has worn off a bit.  It seems like after enough plays some of the optimal strategies start feeling a bit stale.

Andreas Seyfarth; The players are plantation owners in Puerto Rico in the days when ships had sails. Growing up to five different kind of crops: Corn, Indigo, Coffee, Sugar and Tobacco, they must try to run their business more efficiently than their close competitors; growing crops and storing them efficiently, developing San Juan with useful buildings, deploying their colonists to best effect, selling crops at the right time, and most importantly, shipping their goods back to Europe for maximum benefit. A novel game system lets players choose the order of the phases in each turn by allowing each player to choose a role from those remaining when it is their turn. No role can be selected twice in the same round. The player who selects the best roles to advance their position during the game will win. Expanded by: Puerto Rico Expansion; Re-implemented as: San Juan (Card game)

RATING: 5
I like the balance of all the choices, but I don't like the huge learning curve for new players.  It wouldn't be quite so bad if not for the player-to-the-left-of-the-noob-reaping-the-benefits-of-the-noob's-mistakes aspect of the game.  There's a decent amount of pain and angst going into a given turn, as you try to determine not only what's best for you, but what's least favorable for the other players.  Knowing how picking a role will affect EVERYone, including yourself, adversely, is the key to understanding this game.  I'm not quite there yet.

I don't like this game for a similar reason like Alhambra: it doesn't seem to have any player interaction that is worth the name.

Don't quite understand what all the fuss is about.  It's a good solid game, but I wouldn't call it a great game.  From all the indepth strategies I've read and the fact that the only randomness is in the plantation tiles that are turned over and what your opponent does, it seems that among a group of all experienced gamers, it's virtually solvable and there should be an apparent optimal move.  Where's the fun in that?

Recent plays of this game have rehabilitated my opinion of this game. I think perhaps one of the important things with Puerto Rico is that it be played with folks who have roughly equivalent experience with it as you do. When you do, the game takes on a richer strategic texture as well-worn tactics are parried rather than ignored.

Wow. Just wow. What a clever game this is! I was very apprehensive about purchasing this game after reading all the comments about how dry it is and the famous left-right binding problem. After trying it out, I can safely say that it has definitely been blown out of proportion. There are so many moving parts here that it will be a while before I uncover those issues (if at all).

Almost a 10. Docked a quarter of a point for setup, cheap components and some fiddliness. Why... oh why didn't they make the buildings, workers and goods prettier. Borrow a page from AT games and give us some miniatures! I'll fork out the cash.

And I finally have a chance to play the classic!  I liked the role selection aspect of the game and how everyone got to participate in each role that was selected (except prospector).

RATING: 7
This game is fun but seems overhyped. A lot of the buildings are just flat out unplayable, and feel like they need huge buffs (Office? Hospice?). Others are practical must-haves and direct the entire flow of the game (Small Market?). It is possible I am missing a huge part of the strategy here but as a whole Race for the Galaxy seems like a much deeper and more balanced game.

There is also the problem that after repeated plays, people just start doing the same boring openings over and over again. A bit of input randomness to mix-up the opening game would go a long way here.

RATING: 8
I was a little slow to the Puerto Rico party. Although interested in the BGG #1, everytime I read a review or a session report it looked about as dry as dirt. The seemingly endless parade of droning threads about "How the player to your left ruins the game..." made it seem anything but interesting. I had managed to play San Juan a few times, which I happened to like quite a bit. Finding out that Puerto Rico was basically a more complicated version of that game made me think, why bother?

Well, by happenstance I finally got a chance to play this past summer. It didn't take more than a couple of games to change my mind. It was everything I enjoyed about San Juan, but with the randomness of the cards taken out of the equation and the addition of a few more methods to interfere with the plans of my opponents. It wasn't long until San Juan was all but permanently retired. (Don't place ALL the blame for San Juan's disappearance on my exposure to Puerto Rico, his career was living on borrowed time anyway, ever since Race for the Galaxy arrived on the scene...)

At any rate, I now believe the hype. Puerto Rico is a damn good game and completely deserving of it's legendary status. Is it the best game ever? Probably not. It's sort of ugly and the theme isn't really exciting enough to make you wet your pants. As far as being solved goes, I doubt I'll ever play it enough to worry about it. The issue only crops up when the game is played among people who have logged a bajillion plays. I think it plays just fine...

Really interesting and complex dynamics. It's nice that there are so many different ways you can approach it. Biggest downsides are that it's not very enjoyable when the player to your left is doing the same strategy you are but is better at it, and it can be a little dry at times. Overall, though, it's a fun game.

Ingenious mechanics.  A real brain burner.  Personally, I find the game very dry and computational, and it doesn't hold up very well when playing with people of varying skill levels (newbies can/will hand the game to more experienced PR players).

Much like chess, I respect this game, but I don't find it very entertaining to play.

I don't like solved games, and it seems like every time I have played this, or seen it played there's someone in the room who knows the correct move and won't shut up about it. It probably was a great game once, but now it's ruined. And if you have told me what move I should have made, you ruined it.

RATING: 10
I think PR may be the most elegantly designed board game out there.  I think it's a great "first heavy gateway game" for people just getting into games (that's what it was for me).  

It suffers from not having too many strategic options.  After a few games you know that a good number of buildings are pretty bad and they never see play.  As a result, a lot of games unfold the same way, but it's always an enjoyable experience despite that.

10/25/2007: Revised rating to a 4. It will definitely take some talking to get me to play this game again. As I noted in my earlier comments... with additional plays it loses it's luster. It's a dull and dirty gray now. But also for me I'm stuck in a Puerto Rico playing world of insanity. One of the common definitions of insanity is "repeating the same actions but expecting different results." And in my group that definition is very fitting. More damaging to our game play is that we seem to always have a new player, which Puerto Rico cannot well handle. It is a game where everyone should be of the same level of understanding. Sure, most games are like this, but Puerto Rico suffers catastrophically from the problem of uneven playing levels. This is mainly because it is such a procedureal game and someone making the "wrong" selection can cause havoc (or great reward) to others game-plan. To me this is a shortcoming and a fatal flaw in this game. Thus I rate it a 4: I do not enjoy playing it, I don't think it is very good, but every now and then allow myself to be talked into it. I predict that if I do not wait and play this with "capable and compatable PR players" it will certainly fall to a 3 or a 2 rating.

Earlier comments:
I like this game a lot, but with each play it gets more and more scripted. Fun, quick, exciting - requiring people to remain constantly focused, plan ahead, and make tough decision. However, there are many many games better than this.

1/20: Played the 2-player official varient vs. the wife. I was very pleasantly surprised at how good this works. I'm sure we'll be playing this far more often now. Playing this way, I should think, will be a great way for someone to learn the nuances of the game and grow comfortable with making decisions.

10/3 - Lowered my rating from 8.5 to a 7.5 and here's why: firstly, the three-player game, while quick, is terribly rote. There is ALWAYS someone or often more than one person attempting and getting the harbor/wharf combo. Oh boy that's fun. I've done it myself many times and while it can be stopped, it must be done early and with very concentrated precise play by the other two players. Conversely, the person hooking up with both can practically blunder along and just flat-out win. Perhaps a change in the number of buildings available, like is done in the 2-player varient, would create a much more tense and thought-filled game. The second reason I dropped my rating is because I'm finding this game to be more and more scripted with each play. If (insert action) is selected, then do (insert response). It has become more and more rare during my playings that this isn't the case. And that leads me to my third reason for dropping my rating - I've simply played this game too often in the past year and I'm kind of getting burned out on it.

Good 2-player variants available.

Players build buildings and ship goods to Spain. 

A great game of choosing roles, building and shipping. The settling phase provides a random flow of plantations, but the game definitely doesn't have as much variation as its later cousin Cuba. I can see how Puerto Rico can get obsessively strategic for some players who want to find the best strategy.

This has stood the test of time for me. Just an excellent game in nearly all respects: tense, engaging, difficult, but approachable. It gets so many things right, and so few wrong, that the respect it's garnered isn't surprising.

Puerto Rico was one of the games (along with Settlers) that got me into Euro-style games.  It's a great, deep game, with multiple paths to victory and plenty of player interaction despite a lack of "take that" game play.  

Considering the set up is almost exactly the same every game, it also has a remarkable amount of replayability.  I got about six months of multiple plays every weekend in when I first got it, and I'm still up for a game any time.

There are moves you must make / avoid in key situations, or you lose. Worst of all, [i]your mistakes are going to bring down other players, due to no fault of their own[/i]. You can't play Puerto Rico with people of differing skill levels, otherwise the game devolves into a long, drawn-out kingmaking. If you make a mistake in the first rounds the game is already over, but you have to keep playing for the rest of the evening.

I enjoyed the setting and building my little town. The Anniversary Edition's artwork is beautiful.

One of the best board games of all times - still. The gameplay is deep and challenging, there are several path to victory, the game is balanced very well and the theme is well implemented. The only thing I do not like: The minimalistic graphic design that is so typical for ALEA. This game looks soo dated...Just imagine how a Days of Wonder version would look like ;)

I just downgraded my rating for this as the criticism aimed at this game (scripted nature with experienced players) are legitimate. A bit more randomness would have helped the game to remain fresh even after a decade for two.

Finally played it for the first time after having on the shelf for months and months. I suppose when it first came out it was so different and special but now after having played many fine games before it I think it's just another really good solidly designed game.

It's a lot easier to learn and teach than I thought it would be. It is an abstract resource management game with a theme tacked on. I avoided playing it for the longest time because I didn't care for the theme and because I was a little afraid of it.

Anxious to try it again.

In Puerto Rico players assume the roles of colonial governors on the island of Puerto Rico. The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.
 players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists. Who can create the best and most effecient colony?

I finally played Puerto Rico after it sat on my shelf for 9 months -- three players: my first time, against 2 players that played about 4 or 5 times each.  I won 50-42-42.  I honestly don't know how I was able to beat 2 moderately experienced players in a game that has little luck involved.  In terms of enjoyment, it has a very Euro feel in that every player is in their own silo doing their own thing and may occasionally make a move that disadvantages someone else.  I can't really say it was an extremely fun game, but I'll try it again at least once before I give a final judgment.  A 5 for now.  (And could this game be any more fiddly on the setup?!)

Traded for Blue Moon Allies, Flit, and Mimix. (9/16/10)

Solitary multiplayer, a complex game with a thousand components but no depth at all.
More importantly why there is more than one player?
Is like 4 people sitting around with 4 computers and playing solitary spider. 
The fact BGG has this as the number 1 ranked game, make me wary of the top rated games here.. They want to play solitaries as a group. I have my own conclusions of why players want that. But If i want to play games with friends, is to interact them, not watching them playing solitary while the watch me playing solitary. And people that say this game has interaction, they dont understand what the word interaction means. Golf has interaction too?

One of the golden grails of gaming, and the one that perfected the use of role selection. Pages and pages of strategy guide have been written on this game. Surprisingly easy to teach to new players, which is also a bonus. I like it, but it's not in my personal top 10.

Puerto Rico is one of those games that I can play and will never quite win. Always second or third in our 4 player group. I kinda like the game, but dont find it a must play that everyone else seems to do and I did feel in the beginning. There's no in your face or tension, just agonizing decisions that lead to an emotionless end...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Best Game ever, as simple as that. 
Overall, Puerto Rico does a good job of isolating individual decisions--so that, for example, you choose one of the roles, and then you decide what individual action is required by the role. However, because of the high strategic element of the game, the players are encouraged to look ahead, and this can mean that they end up spinning their wheels with too many choices. A few of our players ended up frequently paralysed by the choices, and I expect this is a somewhat common occurrence.

Overall, the strategic gameplay of Puerto Rico is superb. There's a lot of opportunity to plan ahead in a lot of different ways. Thus I agree with the general assessment of the game and give it a full "5" out of "5" for Substance.

This is one of my favorite games.  Depending on the day, it is my favorite game.  In includes all of the aspects I look for in a game: multiple strategies to victory, almost no luck, making choices that affect the strategies of the other players, and you don't really know who won until the points are counted at the end of the game.  My ONLY complaint about this game is that it usually takes a long time to play and is not a friend of new gamers.  If you like board games and are looking for something deep and strategic, and not super frustrating, get your hands on Puerto Rico.

2/08/11 - If we want to play a game but don't have something in mind, more often than not it will be Puerto Rico that gets put on the table, if not this, then Catan.

UPDATE 6/7/14: This is one of the old classics that got us started in the wonderful world of boardgaming with our friends.  It no longer sees the table much, but it is remembered fondly.  Now, we most often play the new games that build upon what Puerto Rico started.

It took me ages to finally buy this game, it just [i]sounded[/i] so boring, the theme etc. Believe the hype, suspend your disbelief, and put your dice and pretty plastic pieces to one side and try it. The satisfaction of having won by clever use of your noggin instead of the luck of the die just can't be beaten.

This is a great game for both gamers and non-gamers. It only takes one game to get people interested in playing it again.

Caribbean plantations in the colonial era is a charged choice of theme that may be off-putting to some but the game mechanics are very solid. The role selection mechanic means that every player choice will impact on every other player, which creates a constant sense of engagement.  Very enjoyable, just perhaps don't think too much about those black disks that you're shipping in to work on your plantations...

Classic Euro; the first game with a role selection mechanic, the precursor to worker placement.

Very fun game. I can see why this held the top spot for so long here on the Geek.

I particularly enjoyed the Governor (First Player) mechanic mixed with the roundabout occupation mechanic. I liked that everyone got to do what the occupation initiator got to do, but that the initiator got a little something extra for being the first one to do so during the round. Player geography played a big part, in that whoever you sit after in the turn really seemed to matter, which is something I don't like, but without a point-buy or auction initiative (which wouldn't really fit in PR) I don't see any way to fix it.

The rules are vast at first glance and really quie simple in play. We found that the only thing we really needed to look up during the first game was the individual rules for buildings and the specifics for occupations, which is still simple enough, and something that you would do less and less as you would become more familiar with these nuances after several plays.

We enjoyed the constant necessity for decisions. There are a great many options available to each player (we played a four player game) at almost every junction, so no one ever felt bored or cornered by previous decisions, which is great. Ultimately, I think that this is PR's biggest strength: Good decisions each round, but with a great deal of strategy involved. 

Players do interact quite a bit. There is certainly some room for screwing over your neighbor and sometimes forming slight alliances (which may not be in the spirit of the game, mind you).

The components are very well done, especially considering how well they stand up against some more recent high production value games (PR is six years old already!).

My opinion on the THE BIG HEAVY: it's okay. As a gateway game, it serves its purpose, though not as well as Settlers or Shadows Over Camelot or even Return of the Heroes for that matter (depends on the "gateway" you're trying to open). But c'mon. Balance? No, not really. Repeat playability? Well, it's better than going to the dentist once a week. Attractiveness? Feh. I play it once in a while, and I can't say that I'm particularly good at it. But the thing is, I don't care. I WANT to be good at A Game of Thrones. I WANT to be good at Twilight Struggle. I WANT to be good at even El Grande before this. You get the point. If you ask me to play Puerto Rico and offered me a beer while we played and I wasn't doing anything else, I'd say yes. But otherwise? I'd take the beer and run.

Misschien wel de grootste klassieker onder de bordspellen.

Het is niet voor niets dat dit spel al sinds jaar en dag bovenin staat in eigenlijk iedere ranglijst. De spelers zijn plantage-eigenaren op Puerto Rico en proberen een zo goed mogelijk draaiend geheel te creëren.

Het spel is uitstekend gebalanceerd. Klein minpuntje voor mij is dat de twee speler variant een klein beetje minder is, maar daarmee is alles gezegd. een topper.

Not enough plays to rate it properly, especially since I've only played it two-player, but I think this is going to be a favorite. The first game was extremely close (I won by a point) and the second had a little larger gap, but moved faster and was more fun overall since we were beginning to know what we were doing. The interplay between players is way more interesting than I thought it would be; I spent most of the game looking at my opponent's board, trying to decide what it was he would benefit from the most (or, better, how I could choose a role that would screw over his plans yet wouldn't hurt me too badly). This made for a nice, tense game and lively banter. 

Edit: played three player, and it was as fun as hoped. Amazingly, this is a very easy game to teach. It looks hopelessly complex coming out of the box, but all those bits mask the fact that it's a simple game to pick up. It's the new Catan for my roommates, which makes me a happy man (because they'll play with me once every few weeks).

Played numerous times face-to-face, and hundreds of times on BSW (mainly with 3 or 4). I have been impressed by this game since my very first play - and still after so many plays, the game keeps its elegance and its interest. A very limited randomness still leads to highly variable games, and even the admittedly best buildings are not necessary to win. The main drawback would be the fact the seating order can affect the result quite a lot, for players of unequal experience. Still, a wonderful design and a very enjoyable game.

This really is a great game that truly deserves its #1/2/3 (wherever it is this week) rank.

There are multiple paths to victory, it's fairly easy to learn, and there's very little downtime.

It loses some appeal if players try to over-analyze it too much, but the same could be said of almost any game.  If you ever find yourself reaching that point you just need to put it away for a while and play something else.


The tired old [i]"win by sitting to the left of the newbie"[/i] complaint needs to go away, because it's stupid.   If the new player is about to take the Craftsman and that's going to dump a ton of points into the next player's lap, TELL THEM WHAT WILL HAPPEN and then give them the option to pick something else instead.  If you do nothing and the game gets "ruined" by a newbie you have only yourself to blame.

What stops me from rating this game higher is its lack of enough chaos.  Holding a card in hand (be it and ending victory condition or a type of resource) gives a game just enough luck for the number cruncher to forsake running everything through.  Without such chaos I find (1) playing this is only an exercise in crunching the numbers and (2) the game more or less reduces to a single optimal strategy of "money early - VPs late" with everything else being tactical (yet excellent tactical) playing.  This "tactical richness" or "tough choices in miniature" I fear is the new prototype for gamers games.

In a word, "dry". I have to admit that it's an objectively excellent game; but, much in the way I'd rather read a pulp fiction fantasy novel than Shakespeare, I usually find myself wanting to play things that spend less time being elegant and more being ... fun.

RATING: 9
I simply cannot get over my admiration of this game. Where can I start? Wonderful bits, everybody is almost always doing something (very little downtime), a dizzying number of paths to victory, lots of decisions, and many fun ways to subtly screw your neighbors. I can't think of a better game than this. A work of art. Can I give it an 11?
Edit: While still a great game, I'm not as amazed with it as I once was. I've been exposed to more games, and I am looking for more theme lately.

I get why this is considered a classic. Game components feel a bit cheap, but the gameplay itself I enjoy very much. The game does feel like there are some fixed build-orders at the start, but I haven't played enough to know for sure.

I can strongly recommend taking up the 'balancing patch' from the BGG forums of this game into account. There empirical as well as simulated evidence that this balances out the win-ratios a bit for every player (regular rules seem to favor the starting player the least and the 3rd player the most).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Good game with some interesting mechanics. Role-selection is nice, and there are plenty of combos/strategies in it to last a while.

The 2-player variant works pretty well. I like this game more every time we play it. Lots of moving pieces but plays in about an hour and isn't too hard to learn.

Sold. Owned within the group (twice I think). Really no reason to keep it around, everyone has it.

Great game. As of 2010, this is still the apotheosis of role-selection games. Simple enough to pick up, but plenty of options for different play styles through the selection of buildings and roles. It's not as tense as I usually like, though. Setup and cleanup kind of sucks. Your mileage may vary.

Peurto Rico has to be one of the most unique games I have played.  It was the 1st game I ever played with role selection.  And I believe the 1st one I ever played with individual boards.  I really like the process of designing your own little island city.  It can be a little dry occasionaly and there are people I would prefer nto to play with. But if others are in the mood, it can be quite enjoyable.

Once upon a time would have been an amazing game.  However, in this day and age I'd rather just play the San Juan app on iOS.  I like that in Puerto Rico there can be a bit of "take that" with regard to the captain phase as it can be quite a setback to lose all / most your goods right after a production. Definitely not a bad game, but there are certainly other things I'd rather play in a similar time block.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Suffers some serious imbalance issues.  Not the gameplay, but w.r.t. the players themselves.  You don't actually play this game, you play the players in the game.  This does not appeal to me, and results in too deterministic outcomes.

Last time I played, I predicted how the scores would fall at the end of the game with 100% accuracy.  How was that fun? Save me the 3 hours of torture and play something I like.  But, I could still be convinced to play, as long as it is with folks of the same ability level.  In groups where this is one or two experts, it is torture and no fun at all.

Really deep game with lots of strategic options.  I personally think it is overhyped due to the lack of player interaction for spots, the bland theme, the sudden endings and the fact that many people have this game down to science.

RATING: 7
This game surprised me as the first time I played it, I was sure that it wasn't for me, but after having the opportunity to get it as a gift and playing it again, I really enjoyed it.

I don't know if it was a function of the players that I played it with the first time or the fact that I had only recently started playing board games at that point and have since been exposed to so many more, but I can see why this game is popular.

Given my limited plays of it at the moment and the amount of time that has passed since I played it last (July 2013), I can't realistically rate it, but I think that it looks very promising. The problem that I think that I'm going to find about getting this to the table is the game length and the fact that it's such an old and established game.

The variable phase order mechanic is implemented in the more streamlined and quicker playing San Juan. While not as heavy of a game by any stretch of the means, it does give you a little taste of what Puerto Rico is like. It also plays in a fraction of the time. The age of the game is also a knock against it as my gaming group generally falls in to the "cult of the new", so this really isn't top of mind.

I would like to play this game again soon to see what my thoughts are on it again... and also to figure out whether or not this is something that I should trade away if it's just going to sit on my shelf.

Just don't get the fascination with this game. To me, any game that has a clear-cut, optimal strategy or two in the beginning of the game isn't going to be rated extremely highly. I don't like how this game encourages going for corn and shipping it as fast as you can or building buildings as fast as you can so that you end the game early. I am more of a long-term strategy player so I appreciate games that allow for long-term strategies.

After playing 5-10 times, it was frustrating getting locked into building by starting with indigo in 2 or 3-player games, on into shipping/corn by going last.  But the number of tough decisions that remain even after knowing what your overall strategy is is still great enough to make the game feel like open-ended.  After this one staying dormant for a while, I've had the urge to play again.

Fantastic game!  There's a reason this classic has remained in the top 10 for over a decade.  My wife and I love this game at any player count; the 2-player variant is definitely worth checking out.  One of my favorite games, and one that my family keeps asking for us to bring when we visit!

RATING: 7
This is a good game, but I don't know that I will rate it higher than a 7.  It is a euro through and through.  The rule set is elegant.  However, there are a couple of major issues that will depress my ranking.  First, as with a lot of games, skill level makes a better player.  However, with PR, the skill level curve appears to be exponential.  Coupled with this skill level curve is a huge down stream kingmaking potential.  Everything that is done directly affects the player to your left.  A poor player will always give the game away to the player on the left.  This creates the 'group think' way to play a game to where it becomes 'you must do this or else...' type gameplay.  While I will play it, I find that these items will not elevate the game to one of the top 9 or 10 spots.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like it, but I don't love it. I haven't yet been able to put my finger on just what I don't like about it. Maybe it's the strong effect seating order has.

This is one of the most efficient board game I have played thus far. It manages to introduce much depth into the game with the minimum of mechanics. I am hugely impressed by the elegence of the game.

Another long neglected legendary title on my shelf. Finally got drawn out and played by me and my friends at our last monthly meeting. 

Oh boy, it was a one hell of a draining session! That's how we felt about the game after our very first playing of Puerto Rico (it took almost 4hrs to finish). 

My first blunt impression of the game is following. 
 1:It is too tight when all the information in the game, except prestige tokens, is open to all players participating. 
 2:At an early stage, it becomes obvious that for losing players, turning the tide is almost impossible.

But of course, this is probably one of the most discussed and the most studied board games in Euro game society all over the world. And with the fact that we have played the game only once. So above is my humble, embarrassing 2yen for the time being. Need much and much more play anyway.

I can't think of a game that looks less intresting to play, but it's something truely unique. Deep down, I think I'll always prefer stuff with monsters and silly bits, but there's no denying the almost artisitc way it's constructed.Surprisingly easy for newcomers to pick up as well, and fun for them because there's also almost no downtime since there's stuff for players to do all the time no matter who's "turn" it actually is. Set up is fiddly though, so just have lots of baggies handy to keep things organized.

Used to be a 10.0, then a 9.0, then 7.0 and now this... Will probably stay right here. Solid, well designed and visually appealing gameplay. The basic set (sans expansions) boils down to one of two main strategies to win. Veteran PR gamers have a phenomenal advantage, as certain selections are mathematically superior, and novice players can easily "hand a game over" to the player on their left. Plays very, very stale and sluggish face to face after playing it online.

Edit: 4th game of what I hope will amount to hundreds! The interactivity in this game is amazing. Everything you do affect the other players, and I love that after playing so many other eurogames that feel a bit too much like playing solitaire.

This is as close to perfect as I&#039;d dare to rate a game.  Lots of great interaction and tense repercussions from everything you do.  Excellent presentation and design, and consistently fun!   It give it a perfect 10, but I feel that the game requires scarcity to function effectively, and is therefore not actually very playable with only 3 players.  There&#039;s too much availablility of buildings in 3 player, and I find that people end up with too much money available to them.  I&#039;ve never tried 4 players yet... I prefer 5.

I had a chance to play the online version and was at first blown away by how much I enjoy the strategy of this game and interplay of the roles, but after a few more online plays I began to see some of the key strategies to winning.  Playing in person was a much bigger step though and putting those strategies into practice isn't as easy as I thought.  This could still possibly get stale for me if overplayed... but I'm certainly up for the occasional game.

Puerto Rico is a multifaceted game that often present players with some agonizing decisions.  The fact that everyone participate in the action you choose (with the exception of prospector) will often make you think twice not to select one that will benefit others more than yourself.  Furthermore, turn order become increasingly more important and as a result, it is obvious that if someone inexperienced is playing, the person after will more often than not benefit from a poor play.

Another aspect I'm not too fond of is how scripted gameplay seem to be.  Although there are many paths to victory, the way you react to other people's selections often does not vary.  Not to mention the game drags on painfully for those prone to AP.  Puerto Rico is a good game no doubt, but is it great, the jury is still out for this geek.

It's likely that this game doesn't need any introduction. Most of the gamers will know this one, or at least have heard of it. So did we, but we never played it before. This one was on our monitor for a long time, but where-ever we looked, we never saw a Dutch edition in the stores. Until yesterday. Bought it instantly and after bagging the game yesterday, I placed it onto the shelves. And there it was, hidden between a couple of hundred other games. How long would it stay there, before one of us, would free him from his neighbours Agricola and Le Havre?

Well, not too long, just one day. We really wanted to play this one, and as we had a couple of hours left, we decided to watch a video of it, and then started to read the rules. The video was a very good one, because I read through the rules pretty quick. Mostly I used the rulebook to set-up the game for 2 players.

This is a pretty easy game to explain to somebody else. The only thing you have to explain is the 7 different roles which are possible. That should be possible in less then 10 minutes I think. When playing, there are a lot of things to choose from, but there's very little to choose. You want to choose 2, 3 or maybe even 4 things, but you're allowed to pick only 1. Every decision is important, and will effect the choice which the other player has to make. Yet, it is possible to think about a long-time strategy. This is a game that really works. Everything is well balanced out. 

It doesn't get you bored during a other players turn, because you also have to play the role. Because of this interaction, it's a game you will be playing from beginning to the end. Sometimes the mechanisms reminds me of Le Havre. If I had to choose between those two, it would be a very difficult choice to make.

I had some difficulties getting the rules right. I guess finally I was successful. I realised only after the 8th play why is this game is the best board game and strategy game of all times (well, it returns to the top time to time). It is very good strategy game, from that kind where you can't backstab your opponent spectacularly, but you can annoy them a lot. Good strategy game without pressure. That's what I like it about a lot.

I believe this game is likely a good game for specific people. I simply don't like many aspects of it.

I would've rated this much higher...had I played it 10 years ago. I enjoy the clean design and straightforward gameplay but, for me, it's starting to show its age. I've only played it with 2 players (offical Alea variant or Craftsman's Angst) and so I think the lack of variable setup hurts its replayability. I'd like to try it with more players and see if my opinion changes. Also, the inferior quality components made me realise that component quality does matter to me.

Rather enjoyable!  The game just zips by ­ amazingly quickly, considering the 90-150 play time on the box.  The rotation of roles, and little things you may try doing in order to squeak ahead really leave you itching to try it again!  Yes, the game takes its two hours, but since you're active pretty much the whole time, the hours just whiz by!

This is the game that pointed me in the direction of BGG.  At a church game night, one of the members of the congregation brought this along and taught a group of us how to play.  (I was in way over my head).  He also mentioned that it was #1 on boardgamegeek.com.  I later came here to check it out and the rest is history.

Simple to learn, difficult to win. Adaptation is the key - if you can't adapt to other players' unexpected choices, you're toast. For all the lack of random elements, it's amazing how much luck always seems to be against you. When choosing a role, it's very easy to benefit your competitors more than yourself. There is a constant feeling of things being out of your control - the more players there are, the stronger the feeling. It's all but impossible to stop a superior player.

Awesome game for serious gamers.  As an Agricola player who was maddened when Puerto Rico took the #1 spot on BGG, I now understand why after purchasing this game.  Game mechanics are simple and the strategy is layered.  Lots of good opportunities to cut some throats.

Editor's note:  After 5+ plays, it's now my favorite game aside from chess.

Second note:  As of 2012, we're back in the "Agricola is better than Puerto Rico" camp.  That's what a New Year's gala in Greensboro with Sceadeau does to a gamer.

This game seems to require an ideal blend of logic and creativity. As a result, it is highly stimulating. The absence of luck is positive for me, but means that my children are less inclined to play as I win too often.

My children are starting to win regularly. We have been playing once or twice a weekend since for a number of months, and they are learning how to win. Now the game is even more fun.

It got old – that's all. Fiddly to setup, depends on pre-made combos and sitting position, thematically uninspiring and the main take-role mechanic got more sophisticated through time (I mean why would I need to take the tile when I can just play a card like in RftG?). The fact that the girlfriend wipes the floor with me in this one doesn't help my judgement.

Update: am not so mad at this game any more. Played it again after a year or so. It holds if you purposely avoid silly combos like hacienda-hospice-residence.
So rating adjusted accordingly from 4 to 6.

After 20+ Plays: I actually do find myself suggesting this game on occasion now, and I continue to enjoy it every time.  While the expansion(s) can add a little variety, the original game is still my favorite.  Upping rating from 8 to 9.

A true classic and one of the best gamer's game to be released in the early years of the new century.  Play it, love it, play it more, get frustrated as you attempt to figure out how to win!

Game plays different and required different strategies based on the number of players

RATING: 7.5
Another classic favorite starting to fall back a bit. Smart worker placement game that feels more dynamic than card-driven ones, and the dynamic between expensive cash-crops and VP heavy crops and the various sundry building means there are many paths to victory. But there is that whole "is this slavery?" aspect when you transport 'colonists' represented by small dark circles. So in my mind I just like to pretend we're colonizing Haiti, and soon all those little disks will rebel (Whatever helps you sleep at night, right?).

3-4 хорошо идёт, впятером слишком долго и местами хаотично. Процесс в целом слишком часто повторялся в других играх (позже), чтобы сейчас чем-то удивить. Но игра стоит на грани евро/гик, поэтому 7 баллов, а не, скажем, 6.

A pretty high rating for a game I currently consider excruciating and don't actually want to play. While there may be no randomness, the chaos effect of other people's decisions compounding can be painful. Extremely short-term planning dominates this turn-by-turn efficiency game, but there's no denying there's some important long-term decisions to make, especially right at the beginning. Theme became drier by the minute for me.

7/19/2017 - The crux of PR seems to be timing the Craftsman action correctly--whether taking it yourself or opting for a different action in hopes that someone downstream will take it.  Essentially every wheel in the game turns on production goods, and taking the Craftsman card at the wrong time can easily cut you out of the points and/or gold you were hoping to earn with the goods you build.  I think Puerto Rico is fun, but too much hinges on a single a single factor--or at least much more than I feel should.  This also, of course, makes the game punishing for new players who haven't figured out this particular nuance yet.

Puerto Rico is so balanced and contains so many strategic elements.

Don't let the rules put you off.  I waited for years to buy this game because I tough it was way too heavy.
Shame on me. It's easier than you think especially if someone teaches you the rules. (The rules have a real nice and logical flow)

It is one of the best games that I have ever played, and I would recommend it to absolutely anybody that enjoys playing board games. If you have not played this game, go find a copy and try it.

Very good game design. Interesting theme. Strangely enough, I consider the playing too tense for me. A single mistake can make you lose. Also I don't like the high amount of casualty driven by other players, when they will face equivalent options for them, but their choices will be crucial for you. To be tried.

Brilliantly designed, loads of depth and strategy, often a surprising winner. Very very good game.

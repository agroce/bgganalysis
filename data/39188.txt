Very beautiful components (Counters, Map, Player aids...). Game mechanics are fluid (no ZoC). 

Many options to (or trying) end war before the leaves fall (hem!) Should you land in the Low Countries, straight to the Reich?

And, very important, lots of replayability.

Surely one of the (THE) game of the year.

Can't wait for more optional rules, more counters ...

Not a bad game but two things that lead to downgrading of the game:
1) The discrepancies between rules and sheets that come with the game.

2) The chit-drawing is a bit to random for me and can spoil a whole game in the beginning - leading to a new start.

En líneas generales me ha parecido un buen wargame, a la espera de explotarlo con más partidas.

Un diseño bonito en mapa y fichas, ciertas mecánicas interesantes (otras algo menos) y en general menos ágil de lo que pensaba en un primer momento.

Tal vez la peor parte sea el factor suerte. Una tabla de combate muy "loca" que puede llevarte a la gloria o al infierno incluso en combates muy desequilibrados. 

Los chits son bastante importantes y le dan al juego un sabor diferente.

Como comentario, la mala suerte con el dado en la tirada de tiempo atmosférico en los turnos iniciales puede dar al traste con la invasión mejor planeada del mundo. 

Nos ha parecido ligeramente descompensado a favor del alemán, aunque con tan pocas partidas puede ser una conclusión prematura.

Outstanding game, well thought-out.  Don't be put off by rumors of thin counters; by grognard standards, the counters are comparable in thickness to most we're accustomed to and are well die-cut (and artistically pleasing to boot).

Superbe production, pas de doute. Règles pas super claires, mais jouables. Système assez classique sauf quant aux chits de Support qui donnent une dimension intéressante pour gérer le chrome.

Pour moi hélas le jeu ne fonctionne pas très bien. Il me semble difficile d'accepter que le mécanisme de combat puisse permettre la destruction complète de divisions alliées sur des tours de 2 semaines. J'ai joué la Normandie pour tester et c'est très difficile de voir une progression à peu près historique du front.

Ceci dit, pour un jeu IGO-UGO assez traditionnel ça reste bien mais je me dis qu'en 2014 on a accès à des designs plus innovants (CDG?) et agréables.

Terrific game, and getting better as I play it.  A fair amount of new stuff to get used to--sequence of play, support chits, etc... but coming together really well and easy to process.  Now, after 15-20 plays, the issue is the strategy--how, after the allies have turned the corner out of Normandy, do they clear out Brittany AND head towards Lemans?  How to jump the Seine and approach Paris?  For the German, when to hold and when to run with dwindling resources?  Best NW Euro campaign game I've played, by far.

RATING: 9
Foundation is bread and butter hex/counter, but with enough other interesting elements to make it much more fun than your typical bread and butter hex/counter (variable landing locations, secretly drawn support markers, KG replacements). Outstanding art and graphics too.

Tried the campaign, and though we got some rules wrong (river attacks and German strategic movement), I came away still very impressed with the flow, dynamics and subtleties of the game. I wonder how re-playable things might be for the German player over time though... The rules look fairly standard and short at first glance, but careful reading and application IS necessary as there are many little twists to the hex/counter formula that must be given attention in order to play correctly - when you do this, you are rewarded with the full dimension of flavor that was intended. 

Art and graphics are wonderful and add very much to the immersion factor. I actually did NOT like the counter design at first (with the unit logos), but over time, I have grown to like them and they are very easy to use for me now.

RATING: 8.5
Rating after a start up game and two solo campaigns.

So far, a worthy successor to Fortress Europa. Graphics are an 8.5 or 9, which is a great start to an update.

Simpler and less restrictive than Storming the Reich, with less cumbersome rules.  

Will have to play several campaigns to come to a final assessment of play balance, possible gameyness, goodness/badness of the high variability of support chits, Fuhrer approval track, killer invasion combinations, etc. 

Update -- two campaigns solo, and it's been close, down to T22 and 23, before Allies got their win.  This seems right in the historical window.  The rules are concise, but tight, covering 99% of what I encountered.  

The Supports mechanic offers excellent if occasionally frustrating variability and replayability, and can generate some colorful narrative (In my second game, I had the Allies take a defensively-loaded Antwerp Festung by use of the one and only time they pulled an Enigma chit all game, and it came when they desperately needed to get the port).  I got 1-2 decent Ger counterattacks in each game, which feels right as well.

All in all, it works, solidly, with virtually no fuss.  Good deal.

Played the COBRA scenario. The game seems to be very good.

This is such a great hex&counter game.  As an Ally you invade whatever beach you want, as the Germans you get to organise your defense lines successivelyup to shores of the Rhine.

Great to play in conventions in teams too, even to newbies as the rules are rather straightforward.

The map and counters are exceptional!

Good looking map, units are that are works of art, good playablility, good realism, good rules, not overly complex, good excitement level.

Never gonna play this, because I don't like the flow of the historical campaign, which I learned from The Mighty Endeavor.  Some grinding in the bocage, then a couple turns of racing across France, then endless grinding against the Westwall.  Most of the map is barely used and the maneuver portion is very short.  Not a great campaign unfortunately.

3 FtF plays of campaign scenario
2 solo plays of campaign scenario

Liberty Roads is a fresh look at a favorite theater, there is no ETO game I'd rather play at this time.  That having been said, I have yet to see the Allies win the campaign, but I suspect that the Allied side is the harder to play well, particularly given system's nuances and ahistorical aspects (noted below).

It's not that the rules are poorly written, or complex ... just that there are subtleties, an interplay of the rules that is not appreciated until you've played.  The game would benefit from sections summarizing: (1) all the first turn special rules, (2) all the rule exceptions in effect when Hitler's mood resets, (3) what you can, and cannot do within range of an Allied air marker ... but that's just my preference.

Liberty Roads is a challenging for the Allied player and fun for the German as they can perform powerful counterattacks and are always in the game.  

The support mechanism and PLUTO markers are a novel way of capturing the supply issues facing both sides, while the randomly drawn support chits facilitate solo play.  

The lack of traditional ZOCs creates a fluid situation.  Promoting a cohesive front approach while still requiring defensive reserves, along with bold penetrations and the counterattacks to cut such penetrations off.  However, it allows infantry divisions to run back and forth along the front ... which isn't much of a problem since they do so at their slow, regular movement rate (typically a "3" for Allied units).


The CRT is interesting as well with Elite units being allowed to choose their poison so to speak.  This becomes a great advantage for a wily German player.

I am concerned that skilled players can "game" the Hitler track.  Specifically, the Allies want Hitler's attitude to stay very poor, and drop to zero at just the right time.  This can be particularly important as the Allies try to "freeze" the German forces in France, delaying their ability to withdraw, which can only be declared if Hitler's attitude is above 4.  If Hitler's attitude resets, the German player loses the ability to strategically move, and normal movement rates are halved which can be a *huge* disadvantage.

The German player faces the reverse dilemma keep Hitler happy or make him reset at a convenient time.  I can see German players deliberately abandoning Paris or even a major port in the path of the Allies simply to get their commander sacked and have Hitler's attitude reset while they're ready to deal with the reprecussions.  The fact that declaring a withdrawal from France (a) lowers the impact of loses on Hitler's attitude, (b) increases the replacement rate (c) virtually causes a reset in-and-of-itself all adds incentive for manipulation of Hitler's attitude.  

The choice of when to best move the PLUTO marker also ties to Hitler's mood.

I further suspect that you want to abandon France *before* abandoning the defense of Paris.  If you lose Paris while Adolf still cares a great deal, the attitude hit for losing Paris is very likely to be enough to knock you below the threshold where you are allowed to declare abandonment ... leaving you trapped in the "bad attitude" limbo.  If this happens, you have to pull back, surrendering cities (preferably non-vital ones) to the Allies in an attempt to deliberately tick off Hitler so that his attitude resets and you regain the ability to declare abandonment.

Bottomline, one of the truly unique things about this game is the Hitler Track ... for better or worse.

I see the game having three weaknesses.  The first heavily favors the Allies, the other two the Germans.

Liberty Roads fails to capture the Allies' fuel supply problems, ironically, the purpose of Operation PLUTO.

In a game like TME, a supply network limits how far flung your units can spread, whether they can move or not.  Only units drawing supply from HQs that in turn draw supply from a chain of trucks (the Red Ball Express) that reach back to a port can be in supply.

In LR, fuel gets to any and all HQs that can trace a path of roads & rails of unlimited length to a port.  The result is that it is very easy for units to widely dispersed while remaining in supply.  Gone is the historic problem of sitting and waiting for fuel that is being dedicated to other sectors.  In LR the Allies can advance simultaneously, and at maximum speed across a deep and improbably *wide* front.  

True, they can't focus their attack supports across a wide front, but so what?  Sometimes the important thing is to get to a location "first and with the most" as the old saying goes.  In LR it's easier for the Allies to move and to move far afield.  I found this is a real killjoy.

Another oddity, is that LR only allows units that fought this turn to exploit (with the exception of a single support chit).  This is a radical, and not wholly welcome, departure from the now standard: mark units in reserve and move them in during a reserve movement phase approach.  Put another way, units held back in reserve during combat, *can not* exploit / move after combat.  This takes some getting used to and limits the ability of the Allied player to duplicate historical results.

Finally, the combat abilities of the Allied airborne units, particularly the US 82nd airborne are ridiculously low.  I understand that the designer doesn't *wish* them to be used as super elite infantry ... but the historical fact is that they were used as super elite infantry, and used in such a capacity *often*.  The game in essence forces them to be used ahistorically - something I never welcome in a wargame.

PS - I was concerned about the counter thickness prior to purchasing LR, but the photos are misleading.  My counters measure the same thickness as those used by the Gamers OCS series (1.3mm .053inch).  They are printed on a gray card stock more akin to the Avalon Hill counters of old.  I do not use tweezers when I play, but I can see why others might.

PPS - I use the Exploitation markers from OCS when we play.  They really help us to remember E, E2, and E3 results, and they stick out from the playing pieces much better. Just use exploitation markers from older OCS games (< OCS 4.0) for E (as they have no number) and the "2" and "3" markers from OCS 4.0 for E2 and E3.

RATING: 5
Nice crafted game about campaign in Western Europe 1944-45. Game is well designed, have lot of chrome rules, reflects major factors of this campaign.
But there are some flaws - first of all is chimaera about choosing landing area. In game which last 12 or so hours all depend of die roll on Fortitude operation if you choose to land near german border (Dieppe, etc.) or far than Normandy. In the end Normandy looks as one and only 'safe' solution if we want play until conclusion.
Second thing is that, by designer choice, Germans are overpowered in a way, that not reflect economic and military collapse of Third Reich. That leads to interesting gameplay, where German forces are dangerous in offense until the end. From gameplay POV it's understandable, but don't make up historical path.

09/23/10 - All my games so far have been the Cobra Scenario.  Another game of that scenario to be played tomorrow, and then possibly a campaign after that.  A very enjoyable game.  Hexasim sticks to solid hex-and-counter roots with subtle changes.  Extensive playtesting is obvious and it pays off.

10/10/10 - I am beginning the Advanced Campaign Game in the next few days and I am very much looking forward to it.  This game has lots of nuance.  It is comparable in enjoyment to Marne 1918, but with better components, a better written rulebook, and a depth of strategic options that did not exist in the prior game.  This is a better [u]game[/u] than Marne.  Consequently, I have given this game a higher rating than Marne, and downgraded Marne slightly.

We have just played Cobra and it was great.  The game came down to the last moment with the Allies winning because of the Surprise Attack support marker.  PROS- like the uncertainty of the Support Markers, kept both players on edge. Like all the color on the counters and the maps.  Combat Chart was strange at first but worked well when you understand the advantages of Elite. CONS-the terrain coloring was a bit hard to figure out. Is it rough terrain behind Normandy Beaches, a minor issue we figured yes if it had some brown.  
Overall the game was a lot of fun and it has uncertainty and tension and loads of color.  The Rules along with the great play by play walk through was great.  I never give anything a 10, so 9.5 is the highest grade for me.

RATING: 8
Moderate complexity, Good looking components

The game is based on a standard IGO-UGO sequence of play, but it has several novel subsystems to highlight the important issues of the campaign and to recreate the differences of each sides:
Allies logistical difficulties, Hitler interference with german high command.
Futhermore the use of support tokens adds a lot of chrome.

The game is at a divisionnal level and is very strategic, nevertheless there's enough room for tactics.
The impressive thing about the design is how those subsystems works very well together to give a convincing pictures of the campaign without to much complexity.
The possibility to try Invasion landing on any coastal hexes of the map and not only in Normandy (actually Normandy is a very good spot) is very interesting and made in a very plausible way. It also adds a lot of replayability.

The game is really up to the buzz.

A game that tries to be realistic and brings chrome to the rulebook. I had great expectations. However, it fails in several aspects: 

-there are zocs for supply but not for movement (?!?), something really bizarre.

-PLUTO markers can be put on hexes occupied by enemy units! 

-German panzers are slower than Allied tanks

-Hitler's humour is easily used in a gamey way by the Allied, therefore avoiding the German gets supports and replacements.

-some details are there just for favouring the Allied, without meaning a benefit of any kind for the German: V2 bases, U-boot bases...

-map is annoying to manage, boxes of units are in weird places

-the game flow is quite unbalanced towards the Allied, who is unstoppable, maybe the campaign results concerning Victory conditions are balanced, but the German has no chances of holding the enemy advance. In other words, maybe the German can win, but he's everytime suffering losses and retreating, counterattacks are usually lethal because those units will be lost shortly after due to the ridiculous zoc rule I mentioned before

With all these things the game experience is not rewarding nor reliable from a historic perspective.

Even if this is a French game (usually not the best nor the worse), it is very good.

High tension during the game.

Hence the game is not that simple but it is not a complicated game.

I recommend it!

 

If you are not interested by the subject and you want a very simple game, play The Mighty Endeavour. For everybody else take this one!

Fortress Europa has been usurped at last. 
A clever game exploring all invasion options for the Allies in 1944

Edit: Downgraded.

In the end the chits prove to be unnecessarily fiddly for the scale. It seems to me the game tries to match a detailed invasion game with a sweep across France game. The two need a different scale and in the end it is a little clumsy (Decision in France - Rhino suffers from the same problem.

More complex than advertised, this is a good game that I wish I could like more, mostly because of the fantastic presentation (division badges are featured) and some creative chrome. However, that very chrome makes this game problematic for me. Also, I think the Holland option is a bit broken. Sure the Allies can be bottled up, but they can also chew the Germans up while planning for the second invasion to save the day. Meanwhile, they are closer to the heart of Germany and threaten the Ruhr right away.

Outstanding game: clean, INNOVATIVE, fun and seems to model western front (1944>1945) very well.

Some great mechanics:

1. Der Furher track is brilliant
2. CRT - love the range of outcomes
3. Support chits handle chrome very well

Minor quibbles:

1. Thought the invasions were too easy for the allies
2. D-Day scenario - 4 obvious picks (you pick 4 of 10 victory conditions) - and no price, in terms of victory conditions, for losses.
3. Wished 5/8 inch counters were used instead of 1/2 inch

Overall, a VERY good game and can't wait to play again. Took us about 30 minutes a turn...campaign game would take about 12 hours...a weekend.

An attractive, easy to grasp and intuitive game covering the campaign in Western Europe from D-Day to the Rhine at division level. The game's use of "support" markers to add lots of historical chrome without the usual rules overhead is inspired and while the absence of ZOCs takes a little getting used to, you don't much miss it once you get going.

I might have preferred a little more weight when it comes to things like interdiction and I definitely would prefer larger counters but these are minor quibbles.

An excellent game that has replaced The Mighty Endeavour in my collection - it's superior in every way. I just wish I had enough space to be able to play the Eastern front version, Victory Roads.

A very good game. Fun and historical, with some of the most beautiful components ever. The mechanics are easy and provides a very fluid and dramatic game play. I especially like the support chit pull system and the Humeur de Hitler track, that forces the Germans to engage in costly and pointless armoured counter attacks just to keep the supplies flowing. 

Could have needed an Exploit [x] counter to make the game physically easier to play. Don't expect to play this without tweezers, or a bent paper clip, it is quite fiddly and your markers will constantly flip or slide. 

Tentative rating, will most likely rise.

RATING: 8
Very initial rating on partial play of D-Day 

The comments for this game, to me, are really accurate on BOTH ends of the scale (which is unusual for BGG as so many exaggerate most times) from what I read, many of the complaints seem very valid to me, as do the all the good points sighted too, and some of the things are both good and bad (that Fuhrer track for sure) 

No Zoc's a little weird in a game of this magnitude but while playing that niggle melted into the background with some time and of course keeps things fluid. Pluto supply placement is really weird and not realistic, and like others mention Ally supply seems to be way too easy overall too (a little OCS influence exerted here would have been awesome). There are a few other questionable things too like: HQ placement (again really liberal), Invasions (seem a little too easy overall especially after playing Normandy 44) and CRT (seems questionable when 2 full strength tanks WITH a column shift attack a lone infantry unit and both end up damaged. Also minor cities and ports give NO terrain bonus but then other hexes like woods get a HUGE x2, so not a column shift but all defenders doubled, yikes, and tripled in a case or two, youzers).  

All that said it all comes together and works fairly well overall and there are lots of neat good things  and nice touches included too like initial German reaction counter attack, Fuhrer track, support marker draws, and more. As for history, obviously things were not meant to be 100% as the game gives you choices to play out some what-ifs (and expansion even more so), what I think is it finds a nice balance to make most people in both camps happy enough. So if you happen to like games that strive for that balance and include both sim/history and a "game" in the package like myself then you should be even more pleased (though it could be a touch too much on gamey side even for me, as a couple people have pointed out things like the Fuhrer track being somewhat open to Ally manipulation, no ZOC’s, etc). Whats also nice here though is the whole West Front is covered not just the landings like in BKN or N44, and the map is HUGE and a beauty too but yet the game remains quite playable. Note though it is slightly process driven, only 15 pages of rules and well written but when you start playing the learning curve kicks in immediately which shows through slow turns as there is just a bunch going on and to account for, but like many similar games will speed up greatly with more play. So overall it played fairly well but I do wonder if with some small tweaking it could be an ultimate WF game, I'm just a little torn on it ATM but mostly I think I'm on board and like it as my rating shows, really I need to play more to know for sure which I hope to do soon.

Amazing game. Highly recommend this one. This game is amazing in many ways. graphically it is awesome - but at the same time not overdone. many of the play systems are top ideas - especially the 'Hitler' track that 'encourages' the Germans to launch attacks at the allies in an attempt to drive them back - as opposed to running for the West Wall like any sane person would do.

RATING: 9
French view of the Normandy campaign.  Liberty Road is a game taste for grandeur. Excellent top notch physical quality of the game components.  The box, however, was scuffed as the publisher didn't send in the bubbles in the box to avoid squeeze...shows that they were not experienced in distributing games.  The box was made up of softer materials that couldn't be restored to its original shape.  A minor pity.  Otherwise, everything is fine in the box.  1 smaller map for the Cobra Introduction scenario.  400 counters with each individual division insignia...very cool looking.  The entire map is 90x84 cm divided into 2 separate maps.  Very clean and clear looking.  When looking at them, I really thought of being an actual commander inside the war room of the German High Command, talking about strategies to Rundstedt together with other fellow officers.  A lot of time historical flavor picture and graphics are on the map to evoke the period feel.  The bikini girls are the French trademark of a game!

The "Fuhrer's Approval" rule is one of the few I have ever seen which recreates faithfully the effects of Hitler had on the German's military operations over which "Approval Level" (by Hitler, of course) would be raised or lowered by taking of the strategic hexes.  The "Approval Level" would be reduced by elimination of German HQs or automatically in the beginning of the German Reinforcement/ Replacement phase.  When the "Approval Level" was reduced to zero, all Support markers would be lost, no replacements would be received in the upcoming Reinforcement/ Replacement phase and all German units' movement factors would be halved to signify that the theater Commander was sacked due to "poor" performance.  Hence, pressure would be mounting genuinely on the "Commander" (i.e. player)'s shoulder if there was no "progress".

Combat results are very interesting and unique and they drive the dynamics of the game internally. There are two types of results in an otherwise traditional odds based combat results table.  The first one is Attrition Result that determines the no. of losses to each side.  The second is Tactical Results, mostly determining the side which should retreat and by how far and the no. of attacking units that can exploit (armor units count only half).  Sometimes an Engagement result is called for and a re-roll of dice to arrive at a new Attrition Result, thus additional losses are incurred. Advance can be made by both sides as long as the hex of the other side is empty after combat.  Units in exploitation can move again at halved the speed (movement allowance) of the unit and then attack adjacent enemy the second time. For the German, if it is the elite armor or elite infantry eliminated, a combat group (KG: Kampfgruppen) is created. The KG pool is limited and if it runs out, no more KG can be created. A very nice way to tell the German organization and relationship between a full division and a KG.  Coupling the exploitation movement with the absence of any locking ZOC rules, they generate excitement and constant danger of breakouts or being outflanked (and thus out of supply) all the time!     

The rulebook is one of the very excellent that I have read in recent years - complete and comprehensive.  A good rulebook is as rare as a jewel in the sand.  I have no problem at all reading it and during game play. Awesome counters art (and there are 480 counters with some very detailed divisional insignia)! The SS unit is now back right in black and white counter.  Gorgeous map. It's a bargain at Euro 36 - and that is talking about the price when it was first released in 2009. Overall, a brilliant, outstanding operational level game on the campaign of D-Day.  Its scope covers the southern France and thus is larger than that of the excellent Normandy '44. To some extent, Liberty Roads is an even more dynamic system than Normandy '44. We definitely enjoyed the game and pulled out much of the tactics encouraged by the system.

RATING: 8
Interesting coverage of the logistics-constrained battles in France and the Low Countries in WW II.  I liked the bidding-style support fire abstraction.  Great game for trying to crack the West Wall.  A bit coarse-grained for Normandy, but scale seems about right for the breakout and chase across France.  I'd love to see the same system on the Eastern Front.

Played two times the campaign. Great game!

Un wargame français de qualité et accessible sur la libération de la France?

Résultat réussi pour Hexasim!

Les mécanismes sont intéressants et permettent une gestion judicieuse de l'humeur d'Hitler, des supports...

Le matériel est de bonne qualité, la carte est superbe, les pions sont beaux, quoique un peu petit et parfois difficiles à saisir, surtout quand les piles de pions s'accumulent en Normandie...

Outre le jeu, le matériel propose un livret décrivant avec force détail l'organisation historique du débarquement et la stratégie allemande. Un régal.

Enfin, malgré le fait que le joueur allemand ai fort à faire, son rôle défensif n'en reste pas pour autant un rôle purement passif puisqu'il aura l'occasion de réaliser quelques contre attaques qui pourront causer de graves ennuis aux Alliés.

I have played several face to face, solo and PBEM games and I feel I’m beginning to know the system rather well:

What I like:

Beautiful map: For once, we have an accurate map of Western Europe! France is more than just clear hexes and a few hills… Nice counters, too.

Good rulebook, reasonably well organized, where one can relatively quickly find the rule he is looking for. Very well done book of example of play (2 complete turns of play) all in color: This is one of the strong points of the game! 

The Combat system with separate attritional and tactical combat results is very interesting, too!

What I don’t like:

The Führer’s approval table: Supposed to encourage the German player to be aggressive… In my experience, this objective is not quite met and the table has many side effects: It can be played to avoid / enforce German operational paralysis at the moment of break-through or during the second landing. I don’t buy it that the replacements and supports available to the field commanders depended on Hitler’s good or bad mood! Once you have your supports, you should be able to use them, ESPECIALLY if the Führer demands counterattacks! In the game, it’s very difficult to counterattack without support when the things get tough for the German! This table makes the game quite tense, but it’s rather unrealistic, IMHO!

Of course, a German player cannot run from the Allies and try not to defend France, but this could easily be achieved by sudden death victory conditions, instead…

Supports: I believe players should be able to choose them, with specific restrictions… May be a system of Action Points could have been implemented to channel / restrict their use…

The supply difficulties of the Allies are not represented in the game: The Pluto marker is supposed to do that, but it’s not its real effect: The Allied player can easily supply any number of units anywhere on the map, as long as he has an HQ nearby! And I don’t like rule 11.3. 1 AT ALL: Allowing to “teleport” HQs directly from England to ANYWHERE (supplied) on the map – to help a breakthrough, I guess – is totally unrealistic and can put entire German armies out of supply: I don’t buy it either!

Summary:

This game is a very nice attempt, but is not the ultimate game on the western front I hoped it would be!

Great game with interesting crome that recreates the Allied liberation of France and advance into Germany.
The German player has to try and keep Hitler happy by being aggressive, if not then they will find replacements and support missing when they need it most.
The Allied player has to deal with supply issues that can put a crimp on their plans.
Great map and counters make for an attractive game.

A nicely present game which sufferred because I had played the Western Front to death with Fortress Europa. I set the game up for solo play, but after a week I still had no made a move as I had tried every strategy with FE. In the end I gave up, packed the box and sold it on.

RATING: 7
The map is tacky but the game is good.  I like that you can select the beach you want but personally I can't imagine not going to Normandy since that is the beach Patton and the other great generals chose.  To this day I cant imagine why in the world we invaded Vichy France with the second landing so I think it is cool to get to invade the Netherlands with the second landing and take the fight right into Germany after you pen them at Normandy.  I had to mark it down because the Germans are a little weak in this and it doesnt have a epic feel to it like it should.

RATING: 9
Very nice game, easy to play but with full simulation value. The treatment of special events and abilities with "support-counters" drawn randomly is cool. The number of support counters underlies weather conditions, the control of major ports and Hitlers mood, a fantastic idea. The impact of those support counters should not be underestimated.

Complexity: 
The best part is that is easy to learn the game without sacrificing the heart of the simulation. Supply, stacking, combat ratio, terrain effects: everything is there but mastered very fast.

Graphics:
All Divisions are represented with their unit symbols, the map is easy on the eyes, overall a great production value.
The counter density is the only negative point but only so long until the Allies break out of their bridgehead. As the game goes all the way up to March 1945 it is not really an issue.

Beautiful game with a good feel and elegant means of handling logistics and events. The rules are surprisingly well translated and edited. Allied support effects are too random and can have too much influence on game outcome. Somewhat unbalanced in favor of the Germans.

In terms of theme and mechanics, this is a great game.  Where it really falls short though is that playing as the Germans is an exercise in nothing more than making obvious reaction moves.  If the Allies launch their initial invasion into the Netherlands, then there is only the slimmest of chances that the Germans can do anything other than win some small victories before the Allies enter Germany and end the game early.

That's the best wargame I've ever played. After about 20 times played, I'm allways pleased to begin a new one. The game is very well balanced. As german or allied commander, you'll have to take care about all of your decisions. You can do the best...and the worst. You can be stucked in the bocage or elsewhere with allies...you can also be in the Ruhr in september '44. German playing is also challenging...you're not limited to retreat...PzDv counterattacks will be very deadly for allies. Everything is also possible with various amphibious landings on all french beaches or even in Holland. All of this with an easy to learn rule of 20 pages...with some genious things as "Fuhrer's approval which gives "tempo" for both players and supports to simplify gameplay.
Great !

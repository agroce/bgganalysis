Fun.  Interesting tension between balancing your income and turning it into points.  My only complaint is that it seems disproportionately valuable to get the cube production vendors early, which you may or may not be able to do based on your random cube draws.

1st play: Meh - Michael Schacht has better games in his arsenal.  We played a pretty significant rule wrong, but I'm not sure it would have changed the game all that much.  I am willing to play it again, but I doubt the game will get picked again, and I'm not likely to pick it myself.  The limit on cubes and money prevents really big combo chains from happening, and the extra characters constantly changed hands.  The art is appealing and I like the theme, shame the game isn't better.

So here we are building an amusement park by buying plots of land and placing show people and then attractions on them.  There are three types of resources; money, red cubes and white cubes.  Money buys land and the services of various characters, who are mostly a help in reconfiguring your resources.  The cubes are needed to place show people and attractions.  Attractions and newspapers (the gift of one of the characters) are the big vp scorers.

The most interesting aspect of Coney Island is that placing show people on the board increases your income.  Likewise, when they are returned to you after being covered by an attraction, your income falls; a neat mechanism to slow down a high scorer.  

However, overall Coney Island seemed just another OK eurogame.  While everything worked, it failed to generate a great deal of tension or many interesting decisions.

The production quality of Coney Island is fine and the artwork is quite jolly.  We failed to uncover any issues with the rules.

A really fun, seemingly light family game that is actually pretty strategic, very competitive, and gives you some excruciating choices to make. I love the newspapers, which almost create an alternate game that runs parallel with the one on the board, generating quite a bit of tension as players collect hidden points. The character tiles also give you many options on your turn. 

By far the game's best mechanic, though, is the way the powerful short-term benefits of the showmen can screw you at the end of the game when they penalize you heavily. Because of this, you have to manage your resources, the board, and your time very carefully to make sure you aren't clobbered during the final scoring.

Meh! It’s short, but the short playing time also means that the number of “decisions” is very limited. The spatial aspect of the game isn’t that interesting (and while you can block it’s not that easy), and the overall gameplay is too simplistic which doesn’t constitute a good game. The various artists you can hire certainly aren’t balanced well, and some are much stronger than others. Also, the luck of the draw (cubes from the bag) can have a significant impact on the outcome of the game, as can the points for newspapers (which seem like a very strong strategy).

Coney Island is... well, not quite what it appears, and even after playing it a few times it still yields a few surprises. The problem is that the game at first appears very tame and boring, thus causing many to shrug and write it off as not one of Schacht's best. But I'm not so sure. Coney Island has three very big things going for it: 

— its rules are clean and elegant: take for example the balancing act between placing small personal attractions and the amount of resources you obtain. Simple, effective, and utterly clear to everyone within one minute of play.
— it has various ending conditions, just like Attika, or Hansa Teutonica. The players decide how they want the game to end. Focussing on one aspect leads to one end condition appearing more quickly than another. Based on previous experience, this is undoubtedly a Good Thing™ as it means the players are not constrained in usual ways.
— it is quite interactive: players can easily harm other player's longer-term income and further topological prospects.

It is once players begin to understand the relationship between all these very simple processes that the game takes on shape and substance, and that is definitely [i]not[/i] something you glean from your first go. I will say that I am not sure how far this exploration of the world of Coney Island's game patterns will take me, but I am becoming more and more convinced that it will be a fun ride all the way. This is without doubt a quality title by Schacht. Where it gets it wrong is, strangely enough, the kitschy and naive artwork which belies its sometimes confrontational gameplay.

This game is OK. I find the theme really disjointed from the mechanisms. You have a decent amount of options, but the game is presented as a family game. It's actually a bit brutal for a family game. I think the game is not "bad". I just don't enjoy it that much. The character that buys newspapers is annoying. It almost seems like you have to let others fight over it or keep stealing it yourself to keep someone from just acquiring a giant stack of papers.

I feel the theme is a pasted on but everything is colourful and it works well with the gameplay. 

It's a typical euro cube collect and spend game with actions and selectable characters.  

The strategy in this game comes with the novel mechanism that income (Points, money and cubes) is related to how many performers a player has placed on the board.  The kick comes when another player builds attractions and uses your performers, returning them to you, and thus reducing future income.  Although this is mitigated with some extra points. 

Any performers left on the board at game end are subject to a points deduction, so the game becomes a timing exercise to maximise income and then build attractions to return perfomers before the end.

I like this game but our group has mixed opinions about it.

Let's get this out of the way first: The theme doesn't make sense. None.

The game beneath that thin veneer of cardboard and plywood is a bit of a freak that doesn't seem totally out of place, however. It first looks like some sort of engine building game but frequent breakdowns and replacements of said engine from the ground up are part of the design. One way to go about is to try to keep your own engine going while shutting everyone else down. Of course, that doesn't work too well in its pure form, either, because shutting down your own engine (or having someone else shut it down for you) is where a lot of the points are.

So we have the caricature of an engine building game with some aggressive interaction that totally lacks a sense of development and accomplishment. It's retreading the same few basic actions again and again and again. Who wants to work in a theme park?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The theme of this game is really cool. You get to build your own themepark. And as the game evolves you really see the park while it gets filled with attraction.

What I really like is the fact that you get advantages as you place your workers on the board. But when you play an attraction (which will give you points) your workers come back and the advantages are gone. So timing is very important.

The character-cards are nice as well.

Fun little strategy game that combines tile-laying with an interesting trade-off mechanism, i.e. you must return 'showman' pieces back to the player board to score big points from attractions, but doing so may reduce your points/income/construction materials per turn. Good amount of decisions in short time-span.

I love games where you build your own park.  This one is odd, in that players compete to build in the same single area of park.  I wasn't sure I would like that aspect, but it works well without being overly cruel.  Just make sure everyone know, if you let someone get newspapers the whole game, they win.  I still find the whole newspaper bit odd.

Not a bad little tile building game, if a bit dry. The highlight is the way your fortunes ebb and flow with the number of workers you have on the board. The more you have out, the more income, VP, and building material you'll collect every turn, but you'll have to give all that up for the big VP-granting attractions. Clever. Don't let the newspaper guy run away with it though.

Clever! Players construct roller coasters on Coney Island. The best way to get the resources to do so involves sending out people to reserve space for you, but you'll need them back by the end of the game. Then there's the special powers; that part is fun too. In classic Michael Schacht fashion, it's simultaneously light, quick and thinky. I like it. (1 play)

I tend to avoid Schacht games because they are generally... "too light" isn't the right word... I usually find them to be too one-dimensional. They become almost an activity rather than a game. Zooloretto/Coloretto is Schacht's finest design because the central mechanic really does create an interesting decision point, even if the rest of the game does not build upon it adequately.

I got Coney Island in a trade not realizing it was Schacht. Clearly I didn't do my homework. I was a little disappointed when I received it, but knowing that learning a Schacht game is no great matter, I played it. There is no innovative "-etto" mechanic in this one, but there are interesting decisions and it has more going on than in most Schacht games. Here you build the board, plan the building, and then build. There are three forms of income - points, money, and building materials. Your basic income is getting one of each every turn, but as you plan - place showmen from your personal board to the playing board - your income increases. The ultimate goal is to build attractions over your and other player's showmen. Your showmen are returned when you take this action and your income goes down again. While you get points when you build your income is punished. You certainly want to build late in the game as the showmen left on the board all detract from your point total. Another facet is that the buildings you build early are worth more than the ones you build late - so the game encourages you to build up and break down again and again. 

The theme is weak, although the art is good. I do think there are interesting opportunities to work against each other and cooperate and with the right audience this could be very interactive. I need to explore it more, but this one might have some plays in it.

Coney Island is typically Schacht with its simple and abstract frame. The theme is nice but forgettable. Mechanically, it's building up the resource engine by placing tiles/workers on the board to generate resources, converting these workers at some point to VPs by overbuilding them with attractions and buying special roles to get additional actions. 
These elements create two interesting features. First, the tradeoff between keeping own workers on the board to generate further resources versus transformation to VPs thereby decreasing resource generation. Second, the option to interfere with other players' resource engine by overbuilding their workers or snapping roles away directly decreasing their future potential although giving them VPs.
Coney Island has to be played confrontationally and opportunistically. If players are left alone with their strategy, they most certainly will run away with the game. The challenge is keeping other players in balance while not sacrificing your own position while doing this. An interesting, nevertheless bland game that might suffer on repeat plays from the repetitive cycle of building up the engine, tearing/having it teared down, build up again etc.

Definitely a game which I'm ready to play again, but because there is no need to get my own copy, I'm quite sure, that I won't play it ever again. But I'm happy to see, that Mr. Schacht has still good pace going on (some other designers have lost their best touch) so I hope we'll see some nice games in the future! Coney Island will get the title "The best new game in Helcon 2011/Lautapelaamaan 2011 event".

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This can be a nasty game requiring people to keep each other in check.  See someone get too many performers out in the park? - Construct a grand attraction over them and return them to their owners.  Sure they get a few points, but so do you and their income decreases considerably!  There can be a bit of tension in deciding which performer to put out due to income received and potential for scoring additional points from grand attractions being built over them...and you do want that to happen before the end of the game as each performer remaining on board loses you 2 points at the end of the game.  The five minor characters and their special actions can change hands like crazy...and probably should to keep people in check.  

Never did feel like I was building an amusement park though!  Felt like there were four people given permits to build the park and we all showed up not realizing three others were also given permits and so a nasty fight ensues!

I tend to like Michael Schacht games. He tends to do lighter stuff without a lot of needless hoo-hah and some tough decisions. I wasn't familiar with this one, and it was tough to figure out the best way to approach it. There's a balance between getting stuff onto the board and keeping it there. The theme is nonexistent; there are red and white cubes called "resources" that literally no one bothered to even paste a name onto. Once we got going we sort of figured some stuff out, and I had a good time, but this is an important detail: I completely misunderstood the endgame and was playing it with literally the opposite end goal in mind -- and won. I'm not sure who this is an indictment of.

Yeah, I wasn't expecting the world's next Through the Ages from the guy who brought us Web of Power/China.  But I have no real desire to play this one again.

The number of meaningful decisions in this game is remarkably low, the theme is a joke, and once that thin veneer strips off, all that's there is a slightly more interesting version of that pen-and-paper game where you try to fill in boxes.  Blocking opponents is about as strategic as it gets.  Luckily, it plays fast.

There comes a highly interactive tilelaying game by Michael Schacht! I love how many choices are put into a short gaming time. This game is fast and cutthroat. Players have many possibilities to mess with each other.
Will play this again and hope replay value stays high.
This looks like a familygame, but I think this is more for gamers! The theme itself is not very strong!

Light/Medium game about building the Coney Island theme park.  Uses area control and action selection mechanics.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game seemed to feature a lot of internal conflict, as the actions you took tended to be both good and bad.  If you played one of your tiles off your board, that was good in that it increased your income, but if you didn't get him back by the end of the game, there was a penalty.  If you played rides to the board, it would score you points (which is good), but also move tiles back to their owner's boards, which would score them (good if it's yours, bad if it's your opponent's), decrease that player's income (bad if it's yours, good if it's your opponent's), and help that play avoid the aforementioned end-game penalties (again, good if yours, bad otherwise).  So it really becomes a game about timing, and making sure other people's incomes don't get out of control (at least without them having to pay for it later).  It makes you think, you see.  Oh, and those newspapers might be somewhat too powerful.

Ok Fun. Might have some (a lot) downtime with AP players, while the game could go rather fast because your actions are (very) limited. Fun with three players too. Many ways too victory!

Michael Schacht at his best: fast, fun, not too difficult but with enough depth. One minus point that you can also have with his other designs as Zooloretto: If players aren't equally skilled, the mistakes of the unexperienced players (for instance let one player buy all the newspapers)can make the decission who will win.

An interesting area-control game with worker placement elements.  LOVE the theme, but it is fairly abstracted...could have been anything, really.  The art is well done, and the components quality is on the higher side of acceptable. Very easy to set up, and fairly intuitive ruleset. 
Complaints:  Can be a little cutthroat, as most area control games depend on some sort of conflict. Gameplay is forgettable in a crowded field of similar games.  I think of Coney Island as sort of a simplified Tigris and Euphrates.

Vai um balde de água fria... Vai um balde de água fria! O jogo não é mau, mas teria gostado muito que fosse melhor; pelo tema, pela arte e porque os jogos do autor costumam agradar muito mais do que este. O tema não é aproveitado, nem tão pouco o artwork brilha nuns tiles tão pequenos, pobres e muito afastados daquilo que é um parque temático na vida real.

Coney Island --

Great interplay of mechanics. Tough balancing act.  Some elements of Hansa Teutonica.  Some definite screwage.

I would buy it if the price dropped significantly. (Currently 43 bucks at CSI)

RATING: 5
Sadly, a bit of a disappointment. On the surface, seems like a great idea (build up your own rides within Coney Island). But to be honest, after our first 4P game, everyone was left feeling 'is that it??'. Way too few big rides available, but in truth, that would only add to the 1 hour plus game time already.

Set up time: 5 mins

Game time: 45-65 mina

Schacht kind of game with simple mechanic, short turn and income phase. Not very interesting though as it turns out to get a bit boring at some point, in my opinion.

3 nice hooks in this light medium game

1) That building an attraction can score for you and opponents, that banishing show folk can be either good or bad depending on the stage of the game (early bad/end good)
2) You can, 2 some extent customise your income which allows different strategies (flipside is you can mess with opponents strategies by banishing their showman with an attraction)
3) Arc shifts at end of game towards getting show people off the board

The theme of the game does not really marry very well with the mechanics though and the muted art work does not  help.

All observations based on one play with 2 and I suspect it will be better with more.

Light, quick-playing but very enjoyable. Ground-claiming actions increase income (VP, $ or cubes), then bitter-sweet development actions that earn VP (for you and perhaps others) but also reduce income. Game end penalty for undeveloped claims. I also like the relatively austere old-school artwork.

Pretty fun and interactive game.  I really like the mix of engine building and positioning on the board.  Do you place your markers far apart in a defensive position, or close together in prep for the end game when you when them all on your board.   There are several ways to make points.  The interesting part is when to pivot from using them and making a dash to end the game.   Good game.

Although Coney Island has simple rules and few moving pieces, I think there are numerous strategies that can lead to victory - definitely one of the best aspects of the game. Unfortunately, I think a lot of games will be won or lost based on who gets targeted most/least. It's actually possible to bomb a player back to the stone age if several players build attractions over that player's showmen, depriving them of any appreciable income. Guess this is my main quibble with a game that otherwise is nicely streamlined, works well and is - like so many Schacht designs - a little out of the ordinary.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Could someone adjust the brightness on the Coney Island artwork?  And the gameplay?  An amusement park theme sets high expectations for a board game, but this is drab.  The board starts as a vacant lot. As the bleak tiles accumulate, one asks: where's the vibrancy? Where's the excitement of a carnival?  Unfortunately, the graphic designer accurately represented the gameplay, which is an unexpected dud from a proven designer.

There's still much left to do in order to become the world's largest and most diverse amusement park! Your family (one of four) has a small, but steady income that should suffice to hire a few showmen to bring life to the oh-so-empty park site. As you earn more, you can afford a favor or two: the police officer is kinder to you, you can hire a migrant worker to do extra work, and you can even finagle the attention of a promoter or a journalist!
The families will need to co-operate from time to time; after all, those grand attractions don't build themselves. In the end, the grand attractions are what will impress the crowds and bring about euphoric headlines in the newspapers!
To set up Coney Island, each player takes two money tiles, a random building material and a player board, covering most of the spaces on that board with showmen tiles. At the start of each turn, a player receives income. At the beginning of the game a player's income is one VP, one money and one randomly drawn building material; as the game progresses, the player can remove showmen tiles to uncover VP, money and material spaces, thereby boosting his income. A player can never have more than five money tiles and five materials.

It is remarkable how most of the instructions of this game are processed into the artwork on the boards. However, that is about the only thing that is remarkable about this pretty average euro game. Even though I won, it gave me no real sense of achievement, and the theme is very much pasted on. All in all, not bad - but hardly the author's best work.

My first impression is that this is too heavy for families and too heavy for gamers.  I also think based on the mechanics that I should like this more than I do and would like to play again to find out if the play is more interesting with experience.  In that first learning game resources were incredibly tight and the board position felt very static.  The interplay of the roles and special abilities for placing tiles seem like they should be more exciting... but in any game where the resources aren't trying to be anything but cubes I suppose there is only so much you can ask for.

Read an interview with the designer, Michael Schacht, a while ago. He said that his main goal is to create nice family games. Well, he succeeded in that with Coney Island. Also I read, that it was original Roman themed. That might be nicer, but would make it less attractive to families I think. There is luck involved in this one, as you have to draw your building materials. You could take it all out of the game, and then it would become a lot more tactical, and interesting to people who play games on a regular base. Best game we played at the boardgames club this month.

RATING: 5.25
Simply didn't work for me.  I like my area control a little meatier.  I did enjoy the unique mechanic whereby you lose production commensurate with building a ride which scores VP and you can use the same strategy to basically "give" your opponents VP and thereby cripple their game engine.

Thematically cute.  Could possibly serve as a second tier gateway to younger players.

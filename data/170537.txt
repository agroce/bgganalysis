RATING: 4
My rating and comments are based on a single six-player game.  With that number of players it seems to me that Swords and Bagpipes breaks down.  The incentive to remain a loyal Scot becomes too strong.  None of the bagpipe cards that I saw favoured the English faction and with six players there are many in circulation.  In addition, the division of points for an English victory between all players who supported it is a serious disincentive to disloyalty in a game with a high player count.  Our game had everyone backing the Scots until the final turn when something radical had to be done to try and reel in the leader.  I imagine that this is a better game with only three or four players; there will be fewer bagpipe cards in play and the spoils for supporting the English may go to fewer players.  

The artwork is a bit juvenile (big heads on small bodies). Production quality is decent.

Fast-moving mayhem and treachery through a really nice combo of interactive and simultaneous features. And featuring me own clan Bruce! (But with our nemesis Comyns on the reverse side of our card - no way for 700+ years of blood feud to be pursued on the tabletop.)

An excellent game that plays like the movie Braveheart. You want to support England to get the gold, but the gold from King Edward is split among all the players who support England so the pay out may not be as great. And if England is supported too many times so that Scotland loses the war, the least treasonous player wins the game, regardless of the gold they have hoarded. If you're obvious, your friends may accuse of being a traitor and cause you to lose gold or take an additional dagger card. A good balanced game with many decisions.

Great production, cool idea...terrible game. Could not figure out a way to accurately guess if the other players were going to play for England or Scotland. Apparently, the game is built on the idea of the prisoner's dilemma, so you CAN'T figure out what the other players are doing. Imagine a game where you had little knowledge of what the other players were going to do...yeah, I don't want to play that game either. Sold.

Very fun social deduction game with some great twists.As a Scottish noble of wavering allegiance, in each turn you have to decide whether to support Scotland or England in the Scottish War of Independence, There are two different game endings (England wins, or Scotland wins), and the actions you can take that support an English win reduce your personal chances of winning should England win, and vise-versa for a Scotland win!

There are only seven rounds, and judging on which of those to break free of the group-think will make or break your game.

A lot of fun in a small package, especially for a Scot living in England such as myself!

I Love This Game! Wonderful! Players represent Scottish clans and choose in each round of (maybe) seven rounds whether to fight a battle for Scotland, or scheme and fight for England instead. Neat game. I think it might play best with 5 players.

I have a set of large wooden castles to replace each player's mat, but this is essentially a card game involving treachery, as Scottish lairds secretly decide whether to join the fight to repel 'Hammer of the Scots' Edward I, or to side with the invading English king. There is a board but this is really only used to show a short four-place track recording the English incursions. As an interesting aside, this game is actually Russian rather than Scottish (from the same stable as the original version of Evolution).

The game play really captures the theme. Played once with four players. Have desired to play again since and would buy a copy. Our game had a varied amount of supporters and betrayers. Component quality is good. I enjoyed the artwork which kept the game light.

One of my first games purchased. I got it in hopes my wife would play with me (she is have Scot). Alas, it hasn't seen much playing time. Would like to see go to a new and active home. 

My rating of a 6 is for lower player count (2 and 3), but is really 7 if played with 4 or more players.

Provisional rating, one play at Spiel, 6p. Interesting concept, but there seemed little incentive to fight for the English. Group-dependent? Just fragile?

It's a known fact that bagpipes run off the static charge that accumulates when kilts incidentally brush up against Moorland grasses. This most commonly occurs during the pipers' annual sprints to the top of Ben Nevis, the tallest mountain in the United Kingdom.

Science!

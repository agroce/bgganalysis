RATING: 10
The rating of "10" is for both the content, outlook of the game, and most important the keeping of promise: I received a message on July 31 saying that the games had been shipped that day and I received the games here in Hong Kong on August 4! Thus I'm really eager to try the game (and I wouldn't rule out the possibility, though I hope not, that the rating might be lowered after plays).

RATING: 10
This is such a fun game!  The rules are simple- end your turn by drawing a card and hope you don't get an exploding kitten.  But as the rule book has a lot of humor in it, it's worth reading just for the laughs.  All of the cards are funny and some are funny in a weird way, but provide endless entertainment as you play.

RATING: 3
Basically just random nonsense. I bought it mostly to play with non-gamers, and I guess it still sort of functions in that context. People do normally enjoy their first few games.

Games I've acquired more recently like Machi Koro and Love Letter fill that "light, silly non-gamer game" slot way better though, and are more fun for me / my girlfriend / any other "gamer" people that happen to be around than exploding kittens.

I struggle to forsee a scenario where it would come to the table again.

RATING: 3
Played this game at a party game night. First thing that struck me is the poor production quality of the cards; these cards are not meant to last. I loved the cute art, but the game was pretty much pulling cards from a deck and hoping you don't get a kitten. You may get some cards from the deck that will help slightly, but I felt very railroaded - at every point, it felt like there was only one logical move to make. Would not play again unless someone really, really wanted to.

Pointless, brainless game.  I have no interest in the Oatmeal web comic, so the "theme" and art does nothing for me, and the game itself is a complete waste of time.  There are fewer decisions to be made than in a game of Uno.

There are very few games I actively hate, but EK would be one of them. Basically, imagine combining set collecting and "take that" mechanics, but stripping out all the fun you just imagined and adding in jokes that are funny the first few times, and then lose their luster.

Very few (if any) meaningful decisions, poorly thought out and likely un-playtested mechanics... In the end, this is an arbitrary slog of a game that suddenly ends with no real conclusion, just a, "I guess it's over now."

I'd rather do my taxes than play this again.

A friend of mine brought over Exploding Kittens and after playing about six games of it, I knew I had to go out and buy it. This game is full of betrayals and strategy. One moment you'll find yourself in a good spot but once someone steals all your defuse cards, you're done for. Really fun game for a group of friends.

RATING: 5
Sure there was lots of raving and complaining about this game! Instead I never cared for Exploding Kittens either way... and, after playing it, I can say that this is not going to change.

Exploding Kittens is indeed a pretty bad game. The main reason for this is, that there's no decision to be made in the game. All you do is drawing cards turn after turn, hoping for the best. The only thing you can find in this box is a pretty dull sense of humor and some light take-that... both things remind me of Munchkin. However Exploding Kittens has one pretty relevant plus, when compared to Steve Jackson's game: It does not take forever to play.

Exploding Kittens is not a good game by any means. It's a stupid luck-fest with some dull humor on the side... but, being quick to play as it is, it's also probably not the most horrible thing you can find, especially if you approach it as a micro game.

Exploding Kittens is a kitty-powered version of Russian Roulette. Players take turns drawing cards until someone draws an exploding kitten and loses the game. The deck is made up of cards that let you avoid exploding by peeking at cards before you draw, forcing your opponent to draw multiple cards, or shuffling the deck.

The game gets more and more intense with each card you draw because fewer cards left in the deck means a greater chance of drawing the kitten and exploding in a fiery ball of feline hyperbole.

Incredibly stupid and not a well designed game. It was amusing enough to play a couple of times at lunch to try it out but that quickly faded. Zero depth or strategy.

A luck-fest with very few options available to the player and early player eliminations likely. I didn't loathe this game until around ten plays of it, the extra exposure has now made me hate it in many ways.

The artwork is trying far too hard to be funny, I don't get the humour so I'm left judging the game for what it is, hence the poor rating.

One of our regulars given its quick setup and portability. Sleeved and stored in a deck box, this base set plus Imploding Kittens expansion fit nicely in a backpack or pannier bag meaning it makes it to more adventures than most other games. Playing with the Imploding Kittens expansion makes two player a bit tedious though not to the point that I've messed with removing cards. For my group, four to five players seems the best balance of things happening and being able to track those things to play strategically.

Love the game!   Addictive!   Simple and quick.   Mostly luck, but some strategy - sorta like UNO or Love Letter in that regard.  The iPhone/iPad app is great too - you can play against random players when you don't have a local opponent.  

Unfortunately, I've been playing it so much I'm getting burnt out on it.

Almost $4m and no discount to shipping or stretch goals? Greedy...

EDIT: Oh look, there's finally 100,000+ backers, so you can all have a whopping extra 16 cards. All it took was exceeding the target by a factor of 400.

Post release EDIT: An ungame that was basically designed (being generous by saying that) put on KS, THEN playtested, yet people went throwing money at it because it's LOLRANDOM. Still, amazing what a bit of internet humour can do for a game that can be completely proxied with playing cards and a Sharpie.

Keeping this score at 1 forever so that there's idiots out there who will keep a 10 rating for this garbage on their profile, advertising their lack of taste to all and sundry. :)

Initial Impression: I actually enjoyed the family friendly version of this game's artwork more than the NSFW version, if for no other reason than I wasn't impressed with the other version's toilet humour. The game itself is based on a press-your-luck mechanism with a fair amount of screwage. This game can get nasty quickly so players should be aware of that going into the game. My family enjoyed the game enough that my kids are requesting it. I'm assuming that the jokes will eventually get stale but for now it will hit the table often.

This is a fun, light card game with a bit of strategy and a fun premise.  The artwork and card descriptions are great as well.  It's really easy to pick up and teach new players, plays in about 15 minutes, and is full of tension and excitement.  However, I wouldn't want to play it all the time because, as players play a few games, the game becomes all about "hoarding" cards in the beginning to just play all of the available actions near the end.  This gets rather boring, but at least the game still finishes quickly even with this.

A ridiculously simple ruleset that somehow manages to overstay its welcome after 1 game.  It takes too long.  The one positive is that the cards are funny, however you never want to show people your cards (if you want to win), so you can't share the comedy.

Awkwardly disappointed with this game. I can see where the appeal would be. But it just didn't work for me or anyone I game with.

The 5+ rounds we played we enjoyed, but it just felt like the same thing over again. I think our problem was that we weren't up for a light-weight social/party game. That may have been our fault.

Regardless, It just isn't going to have a need to pass our table for a long while.

The theme is fun and enjoyable. I'm a cat-lover so anything cat themed is still a winner with me.

It comes in a fancy box that actually 'meow' when you open it and funny artwork from The Oatmeal, but that's basically the only things that I like about the game. I'm keeping this more for collection purposes. It's an easy game to pull out from time to time with non-gamers since they tend to enjoy this luck-fest filler.

This makes for a good drinking game. Buy a few bottles of vodka, and give each player a shoot glass. When you explode, you die and have to drink your shoot. The survivor of each game does not have to drink. Game is finished when all but one player has either: passed out from alcohol poisoning. given up or when there is no more vodka (GET A LOT OF VODKA!). Enjoy!

I really don't wish to jump on the band wagon of terrible comments for this so I will pretend I hadn't seen all them and just review it based on my feelings.

It has great card art and simple easy to learn mechanics. However, the jokes on the cards fit very specific sense sense of humour (think hipster) which really didn't make me laugh at all, nor the people I played with. 

Beyond that it is strategically shallow, and so many of the cards are actually quite boring to play/have in your hand that it isn't as exciting as it should be. 

I won't scream and leave the room if people want to play it, but I don't like it.

Initial Impressions:
--------------------------
Reminds me somewhat of "Straw", as you don't really have much control over what happens, but you just find a way to stock as many power cards as you can and keep the leader down.

There really needs to be an update to fix the beginning of the game.  As it is designed, there's really no reason to do anything but draw cards until the first kitten shows itself, and that can take a while.

Maybe try house rules that limit your hand size to force you to do something.  But out of the box with no mods, this game is just drawing/hoarding cards for no reason until everyone is eliminated.

I was excited to play this game... until I played this game. 

It's a quickish, elimination game where players see who can last the longest using the mechanic of boring-randomness.  

Note: Quickish because in one game, I was eliminated in the first round and then sat and watched two players go through the entire deck before someone won. Buy this game if that is your cup of tea!!!

This is by far the most played game I own. It very frequently comes out at Milly's game night. Seems like some people around here turn their nose up to it because it's a quick simple game.

This is one of those games that explodes because of something completely separate from the game itself.  The game itself is utter chance, sure you have some cards to try and stop it, but in the end it's 100% about card draws, nothing else.  People love this game because of the humor and art, but since they don't do anything for me this game does nothing for me either.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Non-gamers might enjoy this as a replacement for Uno, or for the artwork.  There's very little game here and it's all luck of the draw.  Get a good hand and lean on one person til they're eliminated, repeat while holding your cards as long as possible.  Very meh, getting me to play this again would require the hosts to own nothing better and enough beer I don't care if I'm gaming or just sitting.

Decent card game to play with people when more in the mood to socialise, rather than "game". Could definitely see it being used a fill, but it's probably something I'd have on the table at a "gathering" rather than a game's night - a drinking game in disguise, I suppose.

RATING: 3
I think it's fair to rate this game as any other, not as the creation of a specific person. Let me stress out that I love the Oatmeal as much as the net guy, but there are certain things I just cannot accept about this game.

1. The campaign. As someone who has followed a few kickstarter campaigns, I can see a significant difference between those and exploding kittens. Problem here is that the creators don't seem to give to the backers as much as the other creators. Which doesn't really seem fair, given that they got x10 the amount of cash of the most generous game developers. I mean, you exceeded your goal by 400 times, don't these people deserve a little more?

2. The price. Pardon me for being greedy/savvy, but I just cannot make myself pay 35$ for 2 decks of cards (+ shipment). Yes, the illustrations are ridiculously funny, but there's no way the game mechanic could be that impressive with those 112 cards that I would not feel cheated out of my money. 

So 2 points for illustrations, 1 point for the humor.

"Party" game. (3 to 5)

Pros: 
People who like The Oatmeal like the drawings and the jokes.
It's simple to teach.
Plays fast.
Non-gamers seem to like it... (not sure if it is really a pro, tho)
The stress factor is there, so it does what it wants to do...


Cons:
I'm not a fan of The Oatmeal...
Player elimination (could get long for some people)
The price is at least 10$ more then it should be for this kind of simplicity. 
Not that good of a game
The box is way too big for 2 cards and a half (or so it seems)


Note: If I didn't have that game, I wouldn't buy it. In fact I would be happier if I didn't have it. I just get mad when people see it and wanna play...

Wow. I can only assume basically all of the ~$9M they raised went into designing that box. It certainly didn't go into the game design. Or the fonts. I mean, it's great that the Oatmeal guy can monetize his comics. But why don't we just give him the money directly instead of going through this ridiculous enterprise of having him make a staggeringly dumb game? This is game that's noticeably worse than Fluxx. Seriously, player elimination? Really?

Bryant has been excited about this game, ever since kickstarting it.  He says it must be a great game because it made so much from kickstarter....  It really isn't a good game and the humour ran out before it even began, and I don;t think the NSFW version is going to make it any funnier.  Super duper random... Not as much bluffing as I would like, and it might actually play better with more players.  This game is definitely OK.  IT isn't terribly awful, but no one should be begging to play this game.  Even if it is available at Target, and that is only good for the hobby... much...

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The tension in this game is clearly about drawing cards. Will you or will you not draw the card that kills you? 

Which is why this game gets better the higher the player count and which is why my rating at this time is a bit odd. I've only played it two players where there is little tension as there is only one exploding kitty in the deck, so very little chance to draw it. So there is no reason to play anything but your stealing cards until the end of the game. Making for a very poor game indeed.

However, with more I could see that once you've played your defuse, there will be actual tension when it comes time to draw a card, and so you may actually resort to using your peeking cards when you have a reshuffle in hand, for instance.

Which is why my rating is odd, I am rating the game on a theory, as opposed to what I've actually experienced.

The adult version of the game has more clever illustrations/gags and is not any more problematic than the standard game, I would always play that one if available, even with children.

Requires the right people to play, and I think that five to six players is a good size.

Certainly a novelty, but unlike Munchkin (another "novelty" card game), the artwork and humor is 1000% better.  This game is good to play on maybe an annual basis, as it would wear out its welcome if played more frequently.

I bought two copies during the Kickstarter - one was given as a gift to a friend who had accidentally caught her cat on fire one evening - very appropriate.  The other copy suffered a "mysterious disappearance" by my brother-in-law, who apparently forgot to give it back to me and took it with him when he moved to Brooklyn last year.  Oh well - my wife doesn't like the game very much anyway, and it is my way of supporting Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal) since I have never bought anything from his website.

Unimpressed.  The game felt like it had only one thing to offer (the artwork) but once the questionable novelty of that wears off you're left with a poor card game that involves randomly drawing and matching cards.
It might work well for younger children, but the adult-themed artwork makes it unsuitable for them meaning it's not really good for anyone!

There are much, much better filler games out there, so I'd suggest giving this a miss.

Just... meh.  I kickstarted it since I was a fan of the Oatmeal.  Game always starts out with several rounds of drawing cards because there's no real reason to play any cards until the deck is about half gone.  

There really needs to be something added to this game to make you want/need to play your cards during the beginning of the game.  Imploding Kittens expansion sort of does this, but it's not enough.

This rating is based on humor alone because as a game, this really is mediocre.  The corny jokes made for a fun 20 minutes but I never ever will play this again.  This is worst than UNO, there's nothing nice about this game.  You do not make decisions, you basically go through the cards, laugh about it and that's it.  The only thing you do is hoard cards that do nothing (literally... cat cards do nothing) or play cards that either will do almost nothing.  This looks like a near 9 millions dollars joke... that's a shame.

EDIT: After multiple play-throughs, I've upped the rating. Very fun filler game that's aimed at survival "strategies". Some luck of the draw, some screw-your-buddy. The NSFW deck is very much that. People who know the Oatmeal and that style of humor will enjoy it. Overall, a very entertaining game to play with 3-5 people who are looking to kill 10-20 minutes. 

Ranking based on play-test of Exploding Kittens. Excellent filler game that is fast and fun. Very easy to learn which is excellent for casual gamers. With its quick pace (15 mins or so per hand) extreme portable (standard poker deck size), this is an excellent game to add into your rotation if your group is not up for a night playing Settlers. 

Will rate again once the final version arrives and is played.

This game suffers somewhat from I call the Munchkin effect. The Munchkin effect, in a nutshell, is when a game has a heavy focus on novel humor and while it's very enjoyable every time you see a new element of the game revealed, that aspect quickly diminishes after the novelty wears off. While not fantastic, luckily, Exploding Kittens has a much more fun underlying game mechanic than Munchkin.

A game that is great for getting people into tabletop games or filling in between the strategy heavy games to give your head a breather.  Russian roulette with cards and cats.  Press your luck and time your card plays to survive to the end.  Hilarious art, or course, and an awesome game to just pick up and kill a little time and have a few laughs with friends.  Yes, it isn't hyper deep strategy and can feel a bit reliant on luck it seems, but it's fun and well balanced and isn't that what's important?

This is a great gateway game, especially for 10-16  but adults too. Introducing new people to games where they can be laughing like crazy one minute and then totally stressed, fearful and dreading the bomb the next.  Good times. Super easy to learn, haven't found anyone that doesn't enjoy this.

A party game and I think it does it's job. It's a great gateway game for family gatherings, especially when there's younger children involved. There's really no learning curve and everyone's able to jump right into it. It's an excellent way to burn some time and have fun with all ages.

A very fun take-that, press-your-luck filler game.  As I'm a fan of the Oatmeal online comic, I love the artwork, but others may think it's quite weird.  We played with the regular deck and the NSFW deck combined, and if you do this, I highly recommend to add in extra exploding kittens cards, especially at a lower player count.  This game was more enjoyable with 7 and 8 players than it was with 4, where it seemed to drag since it took us forever to get to the exploding kittens cards.

Definitely a lot of randomness here, but it plays like Uno-on-steroids.  Fun for gamers and great for non-gamers, as it takes about two minutes to teach.  Lots of fun with the right group, but I definitely wouldn't want to play it ALL the time.

If you want a different party game to give yourself a break from endless rounds of Cards Against Humanity, then this is for you. Just be forewarned that there is very little skill involved. It's mostly luck of the draw.

On your turn you must draw a card, and hope it's not an exploding kitten. Before you draw you can play cards to bide yourself time, look ahead in the deck, etc. Each player starts with a defuse card which is the only thing standing between you and an explosion.

The pure randomness and player elimination makes this a bit tedious for me. With the right group that's appropriately slap-happy there may be a modicum of fun to be had.

RATING: 7.5
Warning: don't approach this game seriously. Not all games are meant to be serious or deep in strategy, but they can still be fun regardless.

Exploding Kittens is an excellent party game. Since it's a card game it's quite portable, and it takes a minute to explain the rules to a new player and ten more minutes to actually play. The gameplay creates a tense, Russian roulette-like atmosphere where every player desperately fends off disaster by either screwing over others or drawing from the deck and hoping for the best, and its short play length keeps the player elimination aspect from ever being bothersome. If you want something you can bring anywhere, teach anyone, and have a tense and fun ten minutes with, Exploding Kittens is for you.

It falters in replayability. Once you've played it a few times with the same people, you get a general idea of everyone's strategy and it loses its suspense. This is a game I'd play rarely with the same people, which is why it's so valuable that it's easily teachable and accessible to new players; they keep the atmosphere alive.

RATING: 5
My wife kickstarted this game. I myself knew very little about the game going in. After a playing a few games of this, it seems like the main appeal of the game are the monkeycheese random humor-bearing cards themselves. Strip that away and underneath is a mechanically weak take-that game that mostly comes down to luck of the draw. Employing player elimination is a mark against it, but the games are at least not overly long.

The only strategy I found myself using was putting my less valuable cards in the middle of my hand because the people I played with usually pulled from the middle when the cards were fanned out. This is more of a meta-strategy that has little to do with the game itself. Still, Exploding Kittens has some entertainment value based on players' reactions to the cards alone, though such an assessment implies limited staying power.

This game is decent, fairly quick to play, and very simple to teach/learn.  It's basically a last man/woman standing game.  You don't want to draw an exploding kitten, and if you do with no defense against it, you are out.  That's one negative I felt about the game, is someone could be out very early in the game and that's never fun.  But, the cards are all very creative, and there actually is enough strategy that it doesn't feel like it is all the luck of the draw.

Random chance predominates the "play" of this so-called "game."  I am not offended by the art, etc.  I am offended that this gathered $8MM on kick starter and turns out to be just terrible, while other games, lacking the name recognition of The Oatmeal, may have a hard time selling.

When this game comes out, though, due to its extreme un-fun-ness to play, I leave or start another game.  Will never play again (yes, after multiple rounds across multiple days.)

Fun with large groups that haven't played the game a ton while being social. Long term strategies are few in this game and most of it comes down to tactical decisions near the end of the game with a boat load of luck. I'll probably keep it around to play with people who are looking for a quick game that's easy to understand but I'd rather play something like Deep Sea Adventure.

A decent take on Russian Roulette, Uno, and a hint of Hot Potato. It's a very 'take-that' heavy game, with lots of chances to throw your friends under a bus or two. The artwork also has a strangely disturbed (in a good way) charm to it, making it quite amusing to play 'Attack of the back hair'. Games are usually fairly short, which helps mitigate the inherent player elimination.

Unfortunately there's not a great deal of replay value in this. After a few plays, the game felt very samey. Ultimately, it's a quick, light, so-so game for people who don't mind being mean to their friends. I think there are better games out there, but this one isn't inherently bad.

Exploding Kittens is a kitty-powered version of Russian Roulette. Players take turns drawing cards until someone draws an exploding kitten and loses the game. The deck is made up of cards that let you avoid exploding by peeking at cards before you draw, forcing your opponent to draw multiple cards, or shuffling the deck.

The game gets more and more intense with each card you draw because fewer cards left in the deck means a greater chance of drawing the kitten and exploding in a fiery ball of feline hyperbole.

This game is more of a novelty item than a game and obviously designed to be so.  Going into this game I had very low expectations as this game is notoriously famous as being the Razzies-award winner for the worst game of 2015.  I was not disappointed.  But, I have to admit I laughed and had a good time playing with it.  But as a novelty item like the “100% marshmallows-0% cereal” boxes they sell in gag stores, I have no desire to ever touch this again.  I laughed because it was obvious that the creators clearly set out with the intention to make a game so horrifically bad… its good.  But watching “Plan 9 from Outer Space” with friends is a little different than playing a really REALLY bad game.  

You basically have cards in your hand: some with actions, some to collect (seemingly infinite) sets of types of cats (think Garbage Pail Kids-style) and you draw cars in hope of not getting an ‘exploding kitten’ card.  There are also many other rules that exist in the game without rhyme nor reason: they aren’t intuitive and trying to figure out mechanically why they exist is as pointless as this game.  The creators went out of their way to check off all the no-no’s of game design: No theme [check], No intuitive rules [check], no streamlining [check], Positive Player Elimination [check], no ambiguity in the rules/game play [check], no way of planning any strategy to win [check], no game ending goal [check], no way of know how long the game will last [check], really horrific and cheap artwork [check], poor quality card stock [check], a game that goes on far longer than it should [check].  It truly is an achievement that they made a game this awful.  

As a novelty game, I could see this as a hit with non-gamers and the general public that maybe play a game once every two years (if that).  It is there for a quick laugh (and its creators are apparently laughing all the way to the bank).

Exactly the kind of game I knew it was going to be and the kind of game that is least satisfying to me. This game is for stoopid fun times and made for teenagers who seem to love it, so those are the only two groups I would play this with: people who’ve been drinking and are waiting for the food to show up and bored teenagers you’re forcing to spend time together. 

Mind you, the take-that + player elimination might make some teenagers sulky and even less sociable.

When I play this, I find myself not caring about picking up the exploding cards, in fact, I welcome it. People who dislike elimination games because someone is sitting around waiting for the game to finish, in this case might find it a blessing. If you have too many people like me playing the blasé-who-cares way, where’s the fun and what’s the point?

I’d rather do sudoku in the corner alone than have to play this again. Or learn to play Uno.

RATING: 5.5
A very light, fun, and fast game.  Good for filler and when time is short.  Basically a press your luck type of game where you are tying to make others draw the infamous Exploding Kitten, while trying your hardest not to do the same.

The core game itself is rather lacking in actual decisions that you can make and strategy.  This was mostly remedied though in the "Imploding Kittens" expansion pack.  With the expansion, the game is much better and I would never play it without the extra cards from the add on again.

My daughter loves this, but I don't understand the appeal. I love The Oatmeal but the cards aren't that funny, there is very little variety and there is no real humor once you've seen them all once. Gameplay is average to poor. The saving grace is how easy it is to teach to people. I suppose it can be a quick filler or gateway game.

A game that relies more on the status of it's artwork than the game.  A simple 'take that' that can be broken, even amongst it's randomness.  The winning strategy, hoard as many defuse cards as you can, the one with the most defuse cards is the winner.

A "Russian roulette"-style game with absurd cat art. It plays similarly to Fluxx as far as the "take-that" card play goes, but with two key differences: First, there is player elimination. Second, nobody will mind being eliminated, as the game has a hard once-through-the-deck endgame condition, and hence, doesn't take too long.

For those who say this is a great party game - you throw terrible parties.

I'd say it might be good for a children's party, but there are much better children's games out there.  Also the box meows when you open it, so it gets a few points there.

But yes, mostly a 'non-game'.

I wouldn´t call this a grounded game. I would rather play Parchís or Uno. I bought it for the successful campaign it had in Kickstarter... and I really don´t know how this crap had a single backer. I mean there are thousands of games better than this one. It could be named "Munchkin for chimps" instead. I consider playing this game a total waste of time that you could replace for playing a better game (thousands of options) or simply having a nice conversation or I would even enjoy more just getting bored.

One of the first 5000 Kickstarter Backers. So far, played a 2-player and 8-player game. Both games got down to the end of the deck without anyone getting eliminated before the last 10 cards. Great art and fun cards/gameplay, even if you dwindle down to the end of the deck.

The meowing box can get a little grating, though.

This actually reminds me of a game I made out of a deck of playing cards when I was 8 years old. In it you would blindly push-your-luck picking cards in the hopes of making pairs of cards that you can use to skip future turns. You will want to skip turns as the deck gets thinner, because if you wind up drawing a joker you will be eliminated from the round.

It was quite a hit with my family back then, and we actually still play it from time to time. I guess I should have tried selling that idea, though. Apparently, it's a million dollar idea. Lol!

It just take the first game to understand you just have to collect some kind of cards and wait for the last part of the game. With the second game you'll realize you just wasted your time.
And the humour could be ok (actually not) like 10 years ago. Now it's the standard "mix animal A with object or human behaviour B".
It's also really overpriced.

Better than I expected. The game does a good job building tension and there is some excitement to it. The cards have enjoyable art. However, Exploding Kittens is not as good as Skull (formerly Skulls and Roses). The only reason I'd play this over Skull is the two player works reasonably well.

this is probably the worst game i have ever played.  i mean, seriously, do people actually like this rubbish?!  if you ask most people what they hate in bad games, you are likely to get the answers: 'player elimination' and 'games where you have loads of turns where you dont actually do anything'.  it seems to me that EKs is based on these two concepts.

the standard deck card game 'Sh#thead' is like a good version of EKs..

While it will never be the best game on BGG, and likely never crack the top 500 even, Exploding Kittens is a silly little game you can break out at any time. The tension is actually somewhat realistic, as it plays out as a Russian Roulette style game. 

Not the Mona Lisa, but certainly worth playing when you've got nothing better to play.

Exploding Kittens is a great little party game for 2-5 players (Even more with two decks or the Imploding Kittens expansion). It is extremely well balanced, and most games play until the bottom of the deck. Cards are fine quality, and the artwork is both wonderful and hilarious. 

The gameplay is incredibly simply and easy to learn, yet each game provides a unique experience and a lot of deception. The goal is to not explode, stopping or avoiding those exploding kittens at all cost. It's even great for kids! My 6-year-old son loves it and picked it up in 2 minutes. 

Definitely recommend! Small box, so there should definitely be space in anyone's board game collection.

I'm not into most of the artwork, but the game creates just enough fun for my family to sit down and play a few games when we don't want to invest in a heavier game. I do commend it for increasing the tension as the game winds down, and eliminated players don't feel completely bored as they watch the game unfold.

This is not a game I would recommend playing once, let alone twice. Basically a version of Russian Roulette with cards, it's pretty mindless and ridiculous, and not all that fun unless you've been drinking and the weird illustrations on the cards make you giggle. I would say that its main advantages over real Russian Roulette is repeat playability and easier clean-up.

I like the Oatmeal, I like short filler games.  Guess I'm the target audience for this game.

It was better than expected, in the sense that everyone around the table was having fun.  The game is fastpaced, has lots of take-that moments, and there's this "with enough luck, I can still win"-feeling.

As a game: yeaahh... There's some strategy, I guess, but it's really obvious what the best strategy is (to us heavy gamers anyway).  So you'll be playing on autopilot.  Luckily there's little chance for analysis paralysis, making the game run very smoothly.

So, the game runs smoothly.  To me, that's very important, since I like being the host: playing a game that creates an appropiate atmosphere is more important than me myself playing the game I want.

It succeeds in that regard.  It's a very fine product that does exactly what it wants: a game that requires no thought, has suspensefull moments and a suspense arc, whimsical art, and good production values.  Combine with non-gamers = success guaranteed. 

Now for the negatives.

Once the jokes wear off, and after enough games, it becomes very same-old-same-old.  You play on autopilot and each game plays exactly the same. 

The game is really non-interesting for those that got kicked out early.  Watching the game is really boring, since all cards are hidden.  Except for the occasional nope-wars and the endgame, there's nothing to see.

A lot worse with 2 or 3.  Needs 4, 5, 6 players to be fun.

In conclusion: Better than Uno, worse than Monopoly Deal.

Also, the "expanion" NSFW isn't an expansion.  It's the same game with different art and jokes.  Both of which are worse in my opinion.

EDIT: lowered rating with 1 (6 tot 5), since the day after one person said: "if we're going to play games like this regularly, I don't plan to keep on coming".  My previous assessment that "everyone are the table was having fun", was incorrect.  He liked the art, but found the gameplay terrible because it was play-by-numbers and there were no room whatsover for (creative) choices.  Also: overly long/repetetive, and player elimination.  Note: that person is very easygoing: he doesn't nomally go into the grain.

As a host, it's my responsability to make sure EVERYONE is having a good time.  If one player isn't having fun but is coerced by the overly enthousiastic "look the box meows, and it has kitten-bombs, lol lol lol" crowd, then that speaks for the divisive nature of this game.  Therefore: rating -1

Backed this to get a card game with Oatmeal art.  Ended up with a really fun, thrilling, tense, strategic, push your luck russian roulette game.

Don't let the surface fool you.  Yes you're generally going to end your turn by drawing a card and HOPING it's not a kitten, but it's what you do before that that makes all the difference.  Do you play your cards now?  Take a card from the person on your left? Right? The person with one card left?  Did the player before me skip because he knew there was trouble coming, or to draw out a whole bunch of everyone else's cards?

This game is dead simple to learn, but reasonably complex and a lot of fun.  Works well with a ton of players, and the quick nature of rounds mean people can jump in and drop out relatively quickly.

Re: Luck.  This game has the same relationship with luck that a game like poker does.  Yes, an individual draw is going to be luck (unless there's a kitten loose), but you'll be making dozens of draws in a game, and your play style smooths that out.

This gave me a new appreciation for bland gateway games. I don't understand people playing Ticket To Ride and being like, "Wow, board games are awesome!", and I don't understand people playing Exploding Kittens and having the same reaction. Fine, I don't need to understand.

But at least people who get hooked by Ticket To Ride don't come away thinking "I bet if a game has a funny idea and nice art, that's how I can tell I'm going to like it!"

This game is awful. The other games that have flooded onto Kickstarter following it look worse. Bah humbug, etc. This is at least almost short enough to be tolerable, but not quite.

There are two kind of kickstarters.  
The first kind has given birth to games that have been developped the same way as non kickstarter games: promoters use quickstarter as a promotion tool, but most of the games would have been published without quickstarter anyway.
The second kind looks like the first kind, that's the problem, but the games from the second kind would never have been published because they are crap.  
Keep your monnies guys.

I was given this and had never read The Oatmeal, so that's where I'm coming from. Technically not broken, but this is not even really a game. Stripping away the amusing drawings and captions this is what you do: draw cards and reshuffle the deck until all the "defuse" cards are drawn, declare the player with more defuse cards in hand the winner, and you're done - or you can play it out until the player with fewer defuse cards exhausts them and draws a bomb kitten. My 5-year old thinks it is fun because she gets to make daddy explode, but I sure hope she grows out of this quickly...

It's a shame this artwork (which IS unique and amusing) couldn't have been attached to something with actual gameplay. I don't think it would have been hard to find an game designer to come up with something better than this, which is basically on the same level as Uno. The game certainly generates laughs, but I suspect it will be much like Munchkin, in that it's a joke attached to a "game" and will only be funny the first time you play it.

RATING: 7
[i]UNO[/i], having just been dumped by her boyfriend of three years, puts on her CFM boots, opens ShugaSpün (the Oatmeal's "dating" app) and swipes right on a ballsy Russian...  The "game" is the answer to the word problem "What's two liters of cobra whiskey plus one-boot-off humping plus five rounds in a Saturday night special?" delivered in a jump-cut montage set to Lover Boy's "The Kid Is Hot Tonight".

This ultra-casual filler only really works when played with the right people with the right mindset in the right timeframe (read: [i]goofballs, party-time, briefly[/i]).  As we all well know, there is no greater agony than wanting a game to be that which it is not—and wanting this to be four-hand duplicate Bridge or even Hearts will lead to shock, outrage and existential ennui.  If you have "concerns" I can guarantee it's not for you.

If you're down for a casual pub-style card-chucker as a social activity—and appreciate the stupid-absurd—you just might have some fun with this.

NOTE:  I rate the original version a 5—it gets +2 points if we're playing with a newer set that has [i]Alter the Future[/i] cards.  That tiny inclusion makes it way better at achieving what it sets out to do.

(Party Pack, 2-10 players)

I enjoyed this more than I expected-- I am not a fan of Killer Bunnies, for example. Irreverent humor is not really my thing. But I love The Oatmeal, so I gave it a shot. Now my boyfriend wants to carry Nope cards around for every day use. I was also glad that we were able to teach this game to his parents, who are infamously bad at learning new games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
This game provides nothing but slightly amusing cards. There is no game play other then play a card or don't play a card, oh and then draw a card. Woohoo. 
The cards have very few options. Skip the draw phase, Make the next person play twice or look at the next 3 cards in the stack. You can play two identical art cards to steal a card from someone else. Lastly there is a card to stop an action some else played. 
If at some point you draw a exploding kitten card you lose. Last one left wins. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz
People complain about Munchkin or Fluxx but for some reason rave about this. People are blinded because some fella, who does some comic, made it. I hope the comic is better than this game. 
To anyone one about to buy this, NOPE.

About 2.5-3 out of the 5.5 is due to the fantastic and chuckle-inducing artwork. Game mechanics are similar to a host of other basic card games with a defecate-on-your-neighbor kind of vibe. Not my cup of tea, but not horrible. Definitely not a 10 - so probably disregard those people, but not a 1 either. Take the unfortunate title with a grain of litter.

I do not understand the hate that this game gets. No it's not the best game, nor is it anything to rave about. But. it's a great game for non-gamers with cards similar to uno. The art is palatable unless you get the NSFW version and it plays quickly all while being portable. It's a game that if you don't take seriously is just about having fun and laughing at your own or other's misfortune. would I give it a 7 or higher ever? No. but it's not bad.

There are almost no strategic decisions to make, and the ones that are there to make are obvious. There are better ways to waste your time than with this game. At least Fluxx is chaotic and can have crazy things happen when certain rule cards go into play. This is the same boring thing over and over until you finally have the bad luck to draw an Exploding Kitten with no defuse left in your hand.

Backed because of Inman's art and because everyone else was KS-ing it. If there is one positive about it, it is that it made me start reading rulebooks *before* purchasing games. Only the easily amused have any patience for the gameplay that will drain one's IQ with every passing minute.

RATING: 3
The random draw makes for a suspenseful game.
But ultimately the only interesting mechanic is when the player has the ability to choose where to put the bombs in the deck. Either on the very top, or maybe a few cards down or on the bottom. This makes for a bit of negotiation and social interaction

RATING: 2
Make no mistake - purchasing a copy of Exploding Kittens is purchasing a deck of humorous cards featuring art from The Oatmeal. As a game, it is bland, uninspired, and soulless. The core tension is simply drawing a card, hoping it isn't bad, and then hoping nobody plays a card that takes away the potentially useful card that was drawn. The game doesn't really have any meaningful decisions and, while the art is professional, it feels like the kind of game an amateur designer could have devised in an afternoon using a deck of Uno cards for prototyping.

The game basically plays itself. You're there to hold the cards and play them when required.

No real strategy except deciding when to draw cards the rest is very obvious moves.

I can't really recommend this game for anyone unless they really like cats and bombs. The one good thing about the game is it can play relatively quickly since you don't really make any choices.

The art is funny for about the first couple of cards as it gets repetitive quite quickly.

Exploding kittens unfortunately offers no strategy.  Having played 3 games with 5 players, each player agreed that the game was merely "Russian Roulette", with each player waiting to draw the Exploding Kitten card, and any other cards having no lasting effect on the game.

If the game lasted < 5 minutes, this sort of gameplay may have been appealing as an "in-between other games" style time-filler.

Unfortunately, have no interest in playing again.

* Kickstarted! *

A press your luck-style game in which you (a) may play a card to affect your opponents and then (b) draw a card, hoping not to blow yourself up. The nice part is that a diffuse card in your hand will send the explosive back into the deck at a spot you want. It's a quick game, that's decent as a starter game.

PLUS: speed of play, the chance to avoid death
MINUS: play is basic

This is a hard one to rate fairly. I am a fan of The Oatmeal, but I did not back this game. It seemed way too simple for my gaming interests. The humor and art (while largely arbitrary, especially on the adult-themed version) is fun for a read-through. This, however, is a gaming site and so I must rate this a game. 

"Card game version of Russian Roulette" is an apt description. You essentially have meaningless decisions to make in the game since you are limited to the decisions your hand allows and the outcome/impact of all of those decisions is random anyway (except for "Favors", but come on, everyone is going to give you their worst card). 

The game gets a "2" - which is what I give games that are full of meaningless decisions - but I'm boosting it a point for the fun art and theme. I don't think the game is worth playing once, but if you get your hands on a deck, it is worth looking through the cards, at least. Both versions get the same rating.

This is a great game that I would normally give an 8 to. If I was judging it on how much fun I had on Tabletop Simulator, I would give it an 8.

HOWEVER, the physical copy of the game has one major problem: The cards are super thin and cheap. My friend took it upon herself to shuffle the deck before we started playing, and immediately on the first shuffle a card bent and now sports a permanent crease, so now whenever we see the back of that card we know it's an attack card.

Additionally, the shuffle card is kind of just a drag to use because the deck is so hard to shuffle without bending the cards. And when there are only two cards, it becomes a little difficult to shuffle the deck fairly.

I'll try to contact exploding kittens support to get a replacement, and if I do, I'll change the rating to an 7.

I cannot currently recommend the physical copy of this game due to the card quality. It shouldn't be a deal-breaker, but it killed my friend's spirits before we even started playing the game because she thought she just ruined my Christmas gift.

RATING: 4
The best thing I can say is that the game has an amusing rulebook. The art, the attempt at funny names didn't really do anything for me, (e.g. hairy potato cat... umm ok). The game itself is just luck, each player draws a card every turn and tries not to get the Exploding card.

Backed this in the Kickstarter, I'm a huge fan of the Oatmeal and was PUMPED about getting this game. But once I got it... I think I've played it maybe 3 times. There's just nothing to it. Almost entirely luck of the draw, no real sense of strategy involved. The artwork is great though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
While a little silly at times, there is one basic rule in the game that makes this shine: when you draw an exploding kitten and you have a defuse card, you get to secretly put it back in the deck where ever you choose. Makes for fun player interaction and tension.

Too little depth for me. What's more, clever plays and good card management make you stand out in the group which leads to others denying your actions and setting up bombs for you and...

The game doesn't play itself but it does almost feel like it. In fact, like I said above, you're punished for trying to actually play the game.

Kicsit tartottam a kipróbálásától, de teljesen rendben van, egy igazi rövid, mulatságos partijáték. Az új ára azért némileg ijesztő, de ha ezt nem veszem figyelembe, akkor sok negatívumot nem tudok róla elmondani. Egy olyan kis szórakoztató kártyajáték, ami senkinek sem fáj, nincs mit túlagyalni, egyszerűen csak pörgetni kell nagyokat kacagva. :)

RATING: 6
More of a card game card game than a board game card game. It's a fun, light game that anyone can pick up. Artwork is funny and there can be some strategic elements as the game gets in the later phases. High amount of randomness based on the card drawing. Lots of "Take That!" mechanics which may turn some people off. I like it overall and can be a lot of fun.

Silly card game with about the depth of a party game and raunchy humor, especially if you add in the NSFW expansion.  It's good for an opener, or closer for the night, or if you want to drink and yap and have a prop for doing both.

I've never come away from a game and remembered any particular depth or specific memory from any given game and really only gets played once in a blue moon.

Maybe I'm rating a 1 because I'm jealous of the designers for making millions of dollars from a card game with awful, excruciating mechanics. Actually there are no mechanics. Don't draw the exploding kitten or you're eliminated. Fun, fun. Oh you wanted to sabotage the deck. Not going to happen because I'm going to shuffle the deck. Egads. For a small party game,  I have never seen people laugh while playing this one. Exploding Kitten fans there are many other great games in the board game sea.

Best. Game. Box. Ever. It meows when you open it. Box aside, the game is average at best.

The humour is merely OK. I like Matthew Inman's sarcastic and acid writing way more than I like his drawing skills, and Exploding Kittens is composed of the latter: funny pictures. The theme isn't implemented into the mechanics, like in [thing=176][/thing] or [thing=143741][/thing]. It's just a collection of funny cat pictures.

Theme aside, it's a take-that luckfest with a hard time limit. So, basically, the best kind of take-that luckfest: you just know it'll be over in ten minutes tops.

An entertaining game for fans of the odd, though possibly less so if your sense of humor doesn't lean toward the weird. My kids have a blast with this one, and the illustrations of the various cats are amusing, but some of the other card humor doesn't quite appeal to my husband. It definitely helps if you're a fan of The Oatmeal.

Although this is commonly compared to Uno, I find it less awful.  Yes, there's "Draw 2" type effects.  Yes, it is frequently random topdecking an exploding kitten...

However, there is some actual meta play here when defusing.  How deep do you put the exploding kitten in the deck?  Equally interesting, when an opponent has just defused, where do you think (s)he put the exploding kitten?  (Is it safe to rip off the top, or do you need to avoid the top card?)  Wine In Front Of Me is at least a bit of a game that Uno lacks.

The most successful Kickstarter campaign ever at $8,782,571 that started as a lark shipped on time, and lo and behold it's a decent game. Is it brilliant? No. Is it funny? Yes. Is it short? Also yes. You can play this with non-gamers and gamers alike. It shouldn't take more than 10-15 minutes to play, and if it does, don't play it with those people anymore. This is not a game for deep thinkers and card counters. It's a quick "bang, you're dead" game.

Exploding Kittens isn't much of a game for gamers, it is very simple, very short, and is likely to be skipped even as a filler game. However for non gamers it hits the mark with few rules, nice and funny art and easy gameplay.

Much of the fun comes from looking at all the hilarious cards, and most of the strategy comes right in the last few turns. This surprisingly works out for a good game because as the cards are becoming boring you can shift your focus to strategy.

Got this as it was cheap on Kickstarter. Never heard of Oatmeal (artist) and not a big fan of the art or humour. But okay-ish game to play with friends and probably worth it for the cool box and 'special treat' included. Don't think the game is really as bad as the haters make out.

This is a cute game, and more fun than I expected.

The cards themselves, with Matthew Inman's artwork and lots of funny captions and details, carry a lot of the weight. Without that, there's not enough game there to keep it engaging.

But it does involve enough light tactics to keep it moderately interesting. Do you steal cards from someone else, or save up to fish a Defuse out of the discard pile? Attack now, or wait until you can stack the deck and then attack?

The basic arc -- save up Nopes and Defuses -- feels a lot like Lunch Money (not a good thing in my book), but the road there is better.

Incredibly random game.  Very hard to make many meaningful choices.  The best bit is the box which goes meow when you open it.  Decent art isn't enough to save this game.  Gameplay is simply lacking.  Thankfully it is short.  Don't want to play it again.  

Many other options for quick filler games.  Love Letter for example.

Meh. Final verdict - save your money and spend it on another game. I can't imagine anyone being interested in this game beyond 30 minutes (at most). Rules are extremely simple and there's very little strategy involved apart from keeping track of who may have certain key cards. It plays fast but there's a reason the rules are simple and the game takes (at most) 15 minutes to play and that reason is that there isn't much there. 

The game is extremely repetitive and for the most part you're just left drawing card after card and doing very little on your turn. We played for about an hour and got 6 games in and at the end of it I never wanted to see the game again. 

This game belongs in an age category of 6 to 12 perhaps. Good if you've never played any game at all in your entire life.

My husband had high hopes for this game. He loves The Oatmeal and the concept sounded intriguing too him so he went ahead and backed the kickstarter.  Unfortunately the game is not nearly as good as he was hoping it to be.  The game play is boring and the humor I would have expected coming from the oatmeal really isn't there.  There are so many significantly more interesting games that one could purchase in the price range.  The only redeeming feature is that kids in the 7-12 age range seem to find it outrageously funny.  My children are entertained to tears by "hairy potato cats" and the thought of shaving each others back hair... Even with that it is hard for me to work up the motivation to play with them.

It plays well.  Takes a full play through at least, to begin to see the strategy values of some of the other cards and combos (pair, 3 of a kind, 5 different, shuffle, etc) in placing and picking cards.  Also, after the first play or two players will be familiar with the rules and game and game play will be much quicker.

With 2 decks combined (or the regular+NSFW) you open up play to (6-9 players).

The only downside is the hard to read aspect of the cards text - the funny is just to buried in a tiny font to be front and center.

Got this as a christmas gift - because I love board games haha.
Now I am very grateful for this: It actually has got more plays than most of my games... because everyone loves internet meme humour and kittens, and this is easy enough for every non board gamer to pick up in 2 minutes.
A 5 as a game, would be a 7 of the fun it brings to every non-gamer group, but had to retract one because it is way overpriced for the flimsy card quality (and the ridiculous low amount of cards). Feels a bit like a cash grab.

TL;DR  "Take that" card game... terrible as a game with Oatmeal art (ymmv).

I am not the target audience for this game, but played a demo copy of the game at a flgs on International Table Top Day anyway...

Pros:  the game is not mechanically broken and the artwork is OK.  And a thankfully short playing time.  

Cons:  minimal depth, minimal skill, minimal gameplay... all positives I suppose, with the right group.

Probably best played with non-gamers, intoxicated people or foisted on that poor unsuspecting soul who lives under a rock.

But theoatmeal.com is worth a visit.  Maybe two.

I'm so amused that this game has already gained a swathe of crappy ratings!

Seriously haters- rating a game before you've played it based on an idea you've had from a couple of posts and pictures makes you look like a load of dicks.

I suspect EK will be thin and simple, but I also predict that the mix of The Oatmeal artstyle and humour crossed with Cats is non-gamer, super-viral gold! This thing will probably be the next Cards Against Humanity.

Whether that's a good thing or not you have to hand it to the Oatmeal, he looked at what brings people to his site and took it by the balls.

$10,000,000 dollars backed?! Terrifying! He'll probably give some to a good cause again like he has in the past,  only making the haters look worse.

Where do I start? 

I love the Oatmeal but that alone does not make a good game. This "Highly Strategic" game looks only to pack about five minutes of fun into one or two games before it gets old. If I am wrong then I will be more than willing to change my opinion. 

As it's Kickstart campaign is apparently the highest in modern history I will have no problem finding this game pretty much anywhere so no Fear Of Missing Out. Also I'm guessing it won't be $35 when it makes it's way to Urban Outfitters, Barnes and Noble and Hot Topic (because that is how mainstream it will be). No it will surely be much less. I would think 20 at the most. 

 I'm guessing this will be released to the Kickstarts and then probably hit the shelves before the first decks get into Kickstarter's hands. I'm sure retailers are already making moves to acquire this game. 

The creators (I think) are overwhelmed and potentially greedy or at least that is what it seems like. Why hold out till 4 million dollars till you release a really lame stretch goal. At this point they are making and releasing this game for pennies while pocketing millions (I know, I know, sort of the point of a market economy but not the general mission of Kickstarter, but you know good for them I guess).

I'm glad they are doing well I just hope there are some real rewards for those Kickstarting this project.

A pretty typical take-that card game with some random, and sometimes very strange, humor. I enjoyed the game well enough, but I was ready for the game to be over with long before the end due to playing with all the expansions. Some groups will probably enjoy this, but I would rather play Fluxx, Munchkin, Chez Geek, and many other games in this vein. I draw the line at Red Dragon Inn though.

Tem-Purr-A does the exact same thing this game does in a better way, albeit without the quirky humor, which, at times, made this game a little better than it would be otherwise.

The Russian Roulette Cat Card game. It had huge hype on KS, people dissing it when it came out, but it's actually a good filler game.

Minimal strategy, and a lot of luck when drawing it can be a definite screw you to put back the Explosive card when you defuse. The expansion, however, seemed HIGHLY overpriced just by looking at it, with a negligible cards to boot? I'll just wait for all the expansions to come out at once in a single expansion.

It is beyond compare how bad this collection of mildly amusing illustrations of cats is. It's technically not even a game. I still feel bad for the person I sold this to.

RATING: 5
It's.... ok.  It technically does what it sets out to do, but the player elimination makes it a no-go for me.  The cards are funny, the artwork is so-so (I guess if you like the comic, you'll appreciate the art far more), and the actions are kinda fun to do.  It's press-your-luck with very little ability to mitigate that luck.  At least it plays fairly quickly. :)

There isnt much planning available in the game and as far as party games go, I feel like theres others like Eat Poop You Cat or Push Your Luck games Id rather play.

While artwork and jokes from the Oatmeal make Exploding Kittens a delight to look at, the game itself is too shallow to work as anything but a light party game – and yet it also incorporates the party game faux pas that is player elimination. Good for a laugh or two, but not much else.

This is a tedious experience of a game no matter what complement of people you play with. The game borrows mechanics from other card games (turn skipping/switching in "Uno", deck scrying and interrupts from "Magic"), but it is essentially a "take that" game with amazing Oatmeal artwork. I just cannot see this having a long shelf life.

The game components are average, with "funny" illustrations and an overproduced box that meows when opened!

It is a very casual game with an irreverent theme that dissapears midway your first game, leaving you with a simple abstract game where luck rules, but it has a bit of "push your luck" and "take that". This is not the kind of game I use to like, but Exploding Kittens has a couple of very likeable virtues:
-> It creates tension when drawing cards and manages to keep it all along the way.
-> It does not pretend to be more than it is, with unnecesary twists or game lenght.

Because of that, I'm willing to forgive its shortcomings, like the player elimination. Still, no more than one game from time to time for me.

I played this once and the experience was very much like pulling teeth. It feels like you draw cards and tread water to get the right cards. It does not matter if this takes 20, 30 or 50 turns; the game does not really progress and then bam over. The best part of this game is the fact the lid makes a noise when you open it.

Probably find this more enjoyable than most reviewers just because I'm a fan of the artist and his work. As a game it's too easy to the point where it's almost not that fun. Nice for a super simple party game because it's got the same amount of luck and strategy as a game of Uno so you don't have to concentrate on it that much, but that's about it. There *is* a card-counting element and more advanced combo moves you can learn to enhance play. Will probably by NSFW deck as a gift for the bf just for the fun of it (and because he loves the Oatmeal art even more than me).

There's nothing clever to do. Play the cards you get to put off drawing as much as possible. Otherwise, at the end of each turn draw a card. If it's an exploding kitten and you don't have a protection card, you're eliminated from the game. That's it. The cards are poor quality cardstock, the artwork is average. It's more of a pastime to see who accidentally wins rather than a game. The only aspect of any redeeming value might be the theme. Maybe. Not my kind of thing.

Fun things to look for: just when you think you have a strategy, that shuffle card will ruin it every time! The rules also say pairs of the named cards will grant you special actions, the video says that this can be done with any card. Strategy Time! Pair up 2 or even 3 defuse cards and pull any remaining defuse cards from another player guaranteeing a faster game lol

The cards were amusing. Not the best but definitely a fun game to play when the night is late and your fading quick.

Will try it again.

Pretty uninteresting overall. Has the strategic depth of a puddle and it isn't nearly interesting enough to warrant a lot of plays. It's strongest asset is the card art, which is charming and grotesque at the same time. The tension of potentially drawing a card to reveal an exploding kitten feels weirdly forced and unsatisfying, since this game will most likely come down to random chance as there's no real strategy besides keeping your defuse cards. Thankfully the game is short (like 10 minutes or less short) so you won't waste too much time with it.

A great example of how the group playing and their expectations are important factors to consider in whether a game is 'good' or not. I'd never take this to a games night, but having it taught to me by a friend's 6-year-old and being repeatedly beaten was delightful. It does also have some really good design choices - in particular its ticking time-bomb nature doing away with the 'Fluxx problem' of the game extending long after the fun has ended.

Fun, silly little game for groups that are not gamer or just want to have a relaxing night. Works well as a drinking game too of course. If you're sober and in the mood to be entertained, this game is a little too shallow and gets old very fast.

Cute filler, it is quick but not much game there, there is some humorous artwork on the cars. It is pretty much a take that game until the random draw dedides your fate.
On your turn you get to play some actions cards that may pass to another player, look at the deck, steal cards. Then if you haven't passed the buck you must draw a card and if it is an bang - you are dead unless you have the defuse card as a safety. As you can see the game is mostly luck of the draw.

This was one of my first entries into my board/card game collection. The artwork in fantastic and hilarious. My friends loved staring at and reading the cartoons from Matthew Inman. It will definitely make you laugh initially... However, I feel this game is Uno meets Russian Roulette and I have no desire to play either of those games. The take-that cards can feel harsh and unfair as this really is a game of luck more than anything else. Bullying is definitely a possibility in this game. I would not recommend it.

This game with the base rules isn't fun. It's absolutely dreadful. There is nothing fun about picking up tones of cards until the end of the game where bombs are found, then vomiting your hand until you force yourself or someone else to lose.

This does not make for an enjoyable game.

My rule modifications for it can make it bearable, and even a fun experience. :O

Rather boring game with a fairly self-evident strategy about 2 minutes into the game (hoard all the cards).  I do like how the bombs become more likely to be drawn as the game goes on and defuse cards simply put the bomb back into the deck instead of discarding it.  However, there isn't much in the way of strategy or interesting choices to be had here.

A take-that game with a high degree of randomness.  Played once and enjoyed it.  The design encourages players not to act until desperate (although you will act if you enjoy chaos), which makes for a strange twist to the take-that dynamic, since you aren't required to attack anyone.  Curious how that plays out.

For a game that I backed on KS because of all the hype and how hilarious it sounded I expected very little from this game.  But he game is awesome. From rule explanation to finishing the first game can be done in 15 minutes.

The game is fun. Push your luck by drawing cards as long as you can, worry about when a fragmentary feline will appear, and pick on the weakest player. Once you get past the cartoon art (mileage will vary depending on whether you were a fan of the webcomic it is based on), the game is pretty simple. Not bad, but there are much better short, fast-playing filler card games.

Too random and little to no choices. Typically would pass on playing this.

RATING: 1
Rating based on 2 plays.

The player elimination element is very poorly done.
Early elimination coupled with kittens on the bottom of the deck means that people were sitting around for 10+ minutes waiting for a new round. This is just poor design for a party game.

Gameplay/strategy is pretty brainless too. Draw like crazy while you have a defuse in your hand - do everything to avoid drawing when you don't.

This "game" seems to be popular merely because it is trying to be border-line offensive. 

This is really just a bad game and is best avoided.

Special way of playing. Instead of picking up cards it is quite dangerous to pick up cards from the stack. Because maybe you explode, but if you're packing cards you can also get good cards. For example, you can delay your cards, or let someone else take an extra card. You can also view the top few cards of the stack to know if a bomb is coming. And you can shake the stack of cards to avoid the fact that i catch the card with the bomb. Everyone has 1 card to protect himself from an exploding kitten, and 1 additional card is hidden in the pile. It's a very funny and fast game to play

My friends had fun playing this, so I boost the rating a bit.  For me, it is total junk - worse than UNO because it has player elimination.  There are many light fillers will player elimination that are so much better, like Love Letter. I don't really get the popularity of Oatmeal art - it's not that funny - and even during the first game I had little interest looking at the art of the cards.  I considered not using a defuse in my hand, and just blowing myself up.

I really disliked this game the first time I played it, but after playing it in multiple groups I realized it's mostly just dependent on who you're playing it with. You have very limited opportunity to thwart what fate has in store with you, but just enough that it doesn't feel entirely left up to chance. That being said, while I won't turn down a game, I will not seek out playing this game myself.

I have not played this yet, but the gameplay seems a lot simpler than I thought it would be. I'm disappointed. Also, the "surprise" included was kinda meh, and the shipping from Blackbox was HORRIBLE. They didn't even tape the box up! Anyone could've had a free card game! As well, "Exploding Kittens" was printed on the outside of the box, and for those who have inquisitive/angry/abusive parents like I do? Not a smart move at all. My dad almost threw a fit at the name. This was a major knock off of points for me. Overall, I wish I could get my money back. Not worth the $35 for two decks.

My first play was two player and I didn't like it.  But then a couple of family members sat down and we played it with five people and it suddenly became more interesting.  It's still a pretty simple and lightweight game that is little more than Russian Roulette with cards.  But we actually enjoyed multiple games of it with members of multiple generations and we laughed the whole time.

I'm not the biggest fan of silly games. Not to be that party-pooper guy, but this game also has very minimal content to it. The playable cards lose their humor because you play them every other turn.

A very simple game with a sort of "hot potato" mechanic. It's easy to teach and most players catch on within the first 3 rounds of playing. Strategy and luck mesh well to make for a game that anyone can win, but most wins will go to the more strategic players. 
It can get to be boring as the biggest source of entertainment is seeing the funny things on the cards for the first time. After that every game feels very same-y. I enjoy playing with new players, but if no one new is around I'd rather play something else.

The game feels like a variation of UNO. The theme does nothing for me as I don't read the Oatmeal and I hate cats. As a game, it's terrible. As a social experience, it *might* be OK depending on the group you play with. For a quick game with less randomness and 1000% more fun take a look at "No Thanks!".

Okay, I rarely rate games below 4. I would play almost any game as long as I'm with the right group of people. That being said, if I  had the opportunity I would play just about any other game besides this one (so maybe this should really be a 3). It kind of reminds me of Old Maid for college-age groups.

OK before you throw stones..,  it is a 7 rating because I am rating it as a fun family game with 8-11 year olds kids with 3 or more.

I used this game to get the younger kids into games, now they have moved to Junior Wizard and so on.

This was surprisingly fun.  I had my expectations low because the Kickstarter was so insanely popular.  I figured that nothing could live up to that level of hype.  This is not the second coming.  This game will not heal the sick and raise the dead.  What it is is a rather fun party game.  There's not a great deal of strategy involved or even possible.  The cards are shuffled, and most of the time all you can do is draw and hope you don't get an exploding kitten.  There are defuse cards, which will help you survive, and various cards that let you skip drawing or peek at what's coming.  It plays quickly and the artwork on the cards is highly amusing.  All in all, not a bad little game.

RATING: 7
Exploding Kittens is a fun, funny, and light, 15 minute game.  However, do not expect it to be balanced or perfect, it has its flaws.  As an example, the first 5-15 minutes is often just card draw and with more players it can even be worse.  Most people just bank cards until the first person draws a kitten.  I tried to go beyond the recommended max of 5 players with the NSFW deck and I will never do so again.  With extra cards and a bit of chance, the kittens ended up near the bottom, so we spent 30 minutes drawing cards while some new players spent time deciding which cards to play between experienced players drawing cards.

Additionally the expansions aren't much to write home about.  The NSFW deck adds nothing but art, and honestly I rarely use it and per the above, I would NEVER recommend a large number of players with this game.  

Imploding kittens adds some nice stuff but the collar just delays the game horribly. When someone forgets it is their turn they just delay instead of asking whose turn it is, because they don't want to wear the stupid collar.  I would have rather paid 1/5 as much and gotten the small handful of cards it comes with.

Everyone has one card that can save your life. So, naturally, players figure out to only use it on stuff that kills you. This means everyone uses that card for things that will kill them and just takes everything else as it comes. In other words: The end of the game is already determined the moment you start. It's Candy Land with cat jokes. Boring.

Played it once at a party, we never will again. Group consensus: Boring and pointless.

I think it is an OK game. It seems like a rehash of Uno. But it amuses people quite a bit. I am happy to start a game session with a light game like this. But I still prefer Uno, actually. It's not a very balanced game because the defuse card is the only recourse against being dead. Uno feels more balanced in this aspect as you could win in many ways. I don't find the art very beautiful, but they are obviously painstakingly designed and appeal to many other people.

With the top card face down, you have no choices.  Draw card, did you lose?  If not, rinse and repeat.   I feel this would be an actual game if you played with the draw deck face up.  Then playing a skip card or a shuffle card 'matters', rather than just guessing.
As is, it's not a game, as there is little to no decision making during the activity.

Exploding Kittens is great fun the first few times you play it. After the new of the cards lose their initial humor, it can be a tad boring at the beginning with all the typical hand-loading that people do. I'd still play it, but it's not as fun as it once was.

Played only once and didn't hook me that much. Was okay, but I wouldn't consider buying it or suggest playing it, although I would accept playing it again if someone wants to. The game is about drawing cards, with higher chance as the deck goes thinner to end up with an "exploding kitten" which will make you lose if you don't have a card for defusing (you start with one, you can draw more). Also others can pass their shit to you if they have the appropriate card, so you can make others lose, a bit like Uno.

Really one of the shittiest "games" I've ever had the misfortune of playing. No decisions. Completely random. Atrocious artwork (I find The Oatmeal gross and juvenile, which is exactly why it's so popular in the United States, I imagine). It's also overpriced: $20 (in stores or on Amazon), for like, 60-80 cards. Light $20 on fire, and I promise you you'll have more fun than actually playing this.

Exploding Kittens is about managing odds. Each turn, you play cards from your hand to reduce your chances of drawing an exploding kitten and losing. Played cards are discarded, but exploding kittens are reshuffled into the deck, so while your chances of drawing one increases as the game goes on, so does your knowledge of the remaining cards. Still, the result of the game is largely down to luck.

This feels like a non-game.  You randomly draw and move cards around, trying to make pairs, like a somehow-more-boring variant on Old Maid.  The NSFW deck is lazy, and just goes for some laughs that a middle schooler might appreciate.  I really expected more from Matt Inman, who is an otherwise brilliant dude.

Russian roulette with 100x the game length. Player elimination that can and will happen very early. Almost devoid of any decision making, but has just enough to fool people into thinking they're being clever. But hey, it has dumb looking cats on it, so it'll sell millions.

I could not get into this game. Not sure how it did so well on Kickstarter except for the PR and a famous maker (The Onion). I will be more careful when backing projects after this. It lost it's replayability very quickly.

RATING: 5.5
I really feel as though this game was over-hyped when it first came out. Due to high praise I decided to buy it and when I actually played it I felt a little disappointed. The game itself is easy to follow and thus great for newbies and casual gaming, but it doesn't truly draw my focus like Hanabi or Get Bit! does. I find that I am really just laying down cards without too much forethought (kind of like if I was playing UNO) which doesn't feel too rewarding at the end of the game. In addition, this is another one of those games that I have played a few too many times for my own personal taste as everyone else typically wants to play it. Overall I plan to keep it for lighthearted, introduction games.

Jan 2016: Kinda disappointing. The illustrations are good and accompanying text can be amusing, but the game is so fast playing that you don't really have time to appreciate that, and usually people just read out the type of card (eg "nope!") rather than the full description. With this in mind, the theme seems completely wasted. It might as well just be a card game with no real artwork (Ala Uno, Ligretto etc), which is a shame. 

This was played 5 player with a mixed group of kids and adults. 

Have only played once so will try again some time and see if it fares any better. 

Aug 2016: Had a few more plays with 2 & 3 player games. We had fun. Stupid fun, but still fun. With fewer players we paid more attention to the silly artwork and descriptions and the theme of the game was appreciated more. With 2/3 players you seem to be able to plan people's demise a little more effectively, so the 'take-that' factor is more apparent. Rating raised from 5 to 6. This is now a decent, portable family game.

Really disappointed by this title.  It's essentially just Old Maid with some modified rules that really don't make it any more or less fun.  The cards are nicely illustrated, and printed onto durable cardstock... so I'll give it points for quality there.

Exploding Kittens is a kitty-powered version of Russian Roulette. Players take turns drawing cards until someone draws an exploding kitten and loses the game. The deck is made up of cards that let you avoid exploding by peeking at cards before you draw, forcing your opponent to draw multiple cards, or shuffling the deck.The game gets more and more intense with each card you draw because fewer cards left in the deck means a greater chance of drawing the kitten and exploding in a fiery ball of feline hyperbole.

Silly and fast player elimination, take-that card game filler. Last person remaining that doesn't draw an exploding kitten card that can be defused wins. Use hand management to play card combos to effect play. Cancel a player threat using a 'Nope' card. Replace a defused kitty bomb anywhere back in the deck is unique. Oatmeal art is amusing. Causes some humorous moments.

A game with the complexity that a 2 year old could understand but marketed toward adults. Decidedly unfun, though it does have some decent humor on the cards, yet sadly you can't share the humor as showing your cards to other players will essentially cause you to lose.  Once you've seen all the cards there is literally no point in ever playing the game again.

The game is good for maybe one play except that it is so long it manages to overstay its welcome before finishing even one game.

I feel the game may have been better if there were more card types. As it is, I find it rather boring and prefer other games that have that similar, random fun kind of feel eg Fluxx and Munchkin.

If this were the first game ever invented, it would still be a massive disappointment.  Though the fact that amoebas don't have hands and have never seen a mammal might factor into their rating.

Finally got a chance to play this and I'm speechless.  $8M on kickstarter for this?  I've only had 1 play of this game but I have no interest in having another go.  Frankly there's not anything left to see... this is a one hit wonder at best.  The art, jokes, and humor are good for a laugh but sadly can't carry a game where there isn't much of one to begin with.

Artwork fun the first time, grew old on me pretty quickly. Also don't care about Oathmeal much, so no bonus points for me there either (but probably would for fans of his/her work). But yeah, gameplay... It's Russian Roulette... with a twist... There are some take that elements and tactical plays you can do with the special cards, but the options are really limited and to me the game felt to play almost by itself. Which means I won't really enjoy it. Ever.
Didn't hate it though, if that counts for something...

Bought this at Essen (2015). Not sure it is worth the 25 euros they took from me. No actually I am sure it is not worth that. It's a fun little card game but if I had been in my right mind at the moment I bought it I would have payed no more than 5 euros for it -.- Okay so the kittens explode, maybe that's worth it? I really don't understand the price. Pure rip-off.

The artwork is hilarious, but I've become quite sick of the game itself after 5-7 plays. It basically boils down to luck of the draw. Whoever secures the most defuse cards will win every time. Even though there is some element of strategy, it's not enough. I only bring this game out when friends ask to play it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not a lot of game here, but the push your luck/ screw your opponents bit near the end when the draw deck is running thin and any draw could make you explode (ie: lose) is enjoyable enough for this kind of filler.  A lot of the fun is based on how much you enjoy the Oatmeal art and humor on the cards too... so if that wears thin quickly for you there might not be enough game here to have much staying power.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I know a lot of people really don't enjoy this game, or shudder to call it a game at all. I can admit that it can be very random, and that sometimes you just draw exploding cats close together or even on the first turn of the game. To me, that doesn't matter. This game works brilliantly for my group, and it is so much fun. Of course, this is considering game play with at least 3 players, preferably 4 even. The tension is excellent and the pace really speeds up as the game goes along. It is great fun to draw that exploding cat, defuse it, and then take the deck under the table to count out the dwindling turn count against some player who spurned you by attacking or stealing cards from you. I feel like a real devil in those circumstances. So, take this with an entire salt shaker if you want. I am somewhat of a casual gamer, so perhaps it's the filthy casual in me speaking :P but I do dearly love this game. Great for non-gamers! But I've found that it's just a good, ridiculous time as long as you aren't expecting too much :)

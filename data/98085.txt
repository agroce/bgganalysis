It's exceedingly simplistic: match your cards to existing cards by color - rather like playing dominos. But it has a certain card that I really dislike: swapping goals. In one lucky move, an opponent can steal all that you've accomplished in the game. That's a huge strike for me. Without that, it would be innocuous. As it is, I dislike it.

A casual filler game only.  Although the rules technically allow for 2 players, it needs at least 3 players to be interesting.

RATING: 8
It is family friendly, four player card game, where you have to lay down different coloured cards representing fiery dragons. If you are able to make a set of seven contiguous cards you win the game. It is not as simple as that because you have special cards which let you rob cards from your opponent, or switch objectives or simply just pick up a layed down card. Nice artwork, good mechanics, easy to grasp rules.

In this game you attempt to match up your same colored dragons. A perfectly decent filler game, but nothing too special.

RATING: 7
This a short, easy matching game where players are trying to chain 7 of the same colored dragons. Keep an eye on your dragon's color and the other colors so you can block an opponent from making their chain of seven.

The game is best in smaller groups so that there is the x variable of the extra goals that are technically still in the game and able to be rotated/traded.

Hangulatában valamiért nekem az aranyásókat idézi, de ez jobban tetszik.

My oldest son and I enjoy playing this game as a 2 player or adding other unsuspecting family members who dare sit down at the gaming table. The artwork is beautiful, the game play simple, the goals attainable (though nothing is worse than working towards your goal, seeing it almost done.... and then having someone swap goals) :)

The game is quick and works as an ice breaker, introductory game, or filler.

NEW!: This game is even better when you get at least 3 players.  I took it to a board game party for a starter game.  It's so easy to teach and bluffing with the right crowd is laugh out loud fun.

OLD: As always, once my 12-year-old has done a few plays of a strategy game, it's almost impossible to beat her.  Played two games before bed last night and she won both.  Great game.

Old: I played this for the first time tonight.  I've had it for over a month.  I pulled it down while my 12-year-old was in my office and we were up and playing in a few minutes.  Setup is simple and quick.  Gameplay has a fun mix of chance and strategy.  We ended up playing two more times after the initial game.  My daughter says it's her new favorite of my games.

Quick, fun, very competitive game. It is really easy to learn (5 min) but still has some nice strategy. Theme is not relevant to the game, but the artwork is very nice and far better than color blocks. There is a lot more player interaction in this game than I originally anticipated. It is best with 4 or 5 people.  I like that people can join during mid game and not be at a huge disadvantage. For an extremely portable, quick strategy game, this is hard to beat. Best of all it is only a few bucks.

RATING: 5
I normally hate arbitrariness and chaos in games, but find this to be fun despite being utterly arbitrary and chaotic in spades. The timing of cards is the most important thing to control: either try to set yourself up to steal an opponent's color right before they claim a win, or, if your color is succeeding, plan on saving a power card to retake a color that someone else might steal from you. (Of course, if someone takes your entire hand, that's more difficult!) There is little strategy here, but if you can let go of your desire to win and just have fun with it, it's entertaining enough.

Ez a filler játék nagyon bejött a társaságunknak, pedig leárazva egy Aldiban (!) vettük 2000 ft alatt. Az akciókártyák és a titkos (de felderíthető) célok visznek bele kellő mértékű stratégiát egy amúgy elég random, dominószerű játékba. Viszont ha minden játékos ismeri a játékot, elég könnyen döntetlen lehet a vége. A folyamatos status quo érdekében körönként változnak az alkalmi szövetségek, hiszen meg kell állítani és bekeríteni azt, akinek épp a legtöbb összefüggő területe van: mindezt persze mindenki igyekszik úgy meglépni, hogy közben a saját (vagy azon szomszédja) színét növelje (akinek a célját úgy sejti, hogy meg tudja szerezni).

I got this game figuring I could remove the action cards and play it with my 5-year-old daughter. But I was pleasantly surprised when I opened up the instructions to find that there were recommendations on how to play with kids of different ages. We've been introducing each action card to our daughter one-at-a-time for the past few days, and are about ready to play a full game with her already. 

For adults, this makes a fun filler or party game, with plenty of twists and turns to keep everyone one their toes. Good game.

A fairly simple game, it plays quickly, has an interesting mechanic, and the hidden goals add a fun aspect of trying to figure out what your opponents are going for. Not sure how much skill is involved, sometimes you just need the right card and you can win. Also, I'm not sure how much replayability the game will have, it might get old once the uniqueness of the primary mechanic wears off.

A light filler game with beautiful art work.  A matching game somewhat like dominoes. Ages of 6+ is about right.  

It is fast with simple rules, and a mess-with-your-opponents element that makes the game chaotic.

Nice little card game that looks good on the table. I'm not such a fan of games in which hands & goals are traded, but in this one it's part of the tactics. Luck of the draw will often decide whether you can stop someone from making a string of 7. But I don't mind in such quick games, though they might sometimes end too quickly.

If you'd use the cards as wall art my rating would rise considerably. The game, I'm afraid, is rather pointless. Why should anybody try to play well if, by the play of a single card, you can make the best player the worst and vice versa? Not that you actually have control over what cards you can play since those can be swapped liberally as well...

Best suited for kids. If everyone knows what they're doing, it's likely to end in a tie after a LONG time going through the deck. The idea of having goals rotate out to nonexistence players is brilliant, making a 4-player game the perfect amount.

The dominoes-like card placement is kind of fun but typical Looney chaos ruins it. Exchanging hands is bad enough, but switching goals means any effort you make can be arbitrarily snatched away. Lame.

A game I often use to introduce newcomers to gaming, or to fill time. I liken it 'a mix of dominos and fluxx, with both the board building element of dominos and the rule-changing element of fluxx important in it'. Part of the art of the game is working out who is seeking what goal (the win condition is to get 7 dragons connected of your colour) and using that information to your advantage, considering how conditions are likely to change.

Similar to Aquarius, Seven Dragons includes the addition of the Silver Dragon.  The Silver Dragon is the starting tile, which starts wild and changes color based on the color of the top Action of the discard pile.  You may discard to the top or the bottom of the pile, so you don't necessarily have to change the Silver Dragon's color.

Each player has a secret Goal.  The cards have one to four dragon images on them, and players are playing them to a common board by matching at least one color.  First to get seven connected dragons of their color wins.

Initial Rating: 4.5 (September 2013)

At first, I really enjoyed this little game because it was so quick, but after another game, I began to get bored as the game took much longer to play and had so few interesting decisions. I like the hidden identities in it, however I hate the “attack the leader” mechanic prevalent in this game. This makes for longer games until a player finally get lucky and wins the game. If all players know how to play, the game will take longer. It is too light for my taste. I also dislike the action cards, as they totally wreck any strategy you could have. The name is great but there is no theme in it.  It is a good game if playtime doesn’t exceed 25 minutes, more than that and I’m getting bored. 

The game components and art are ok. The game is easy to learn and teach making it perfect to introduce to new gamers and/or family. 
 
This game has had some positive buzz among my game group, however I´m beginning to drift apart from general consensus and no longer enjoy light games.

For now, I will play again if requested, but I won’t pursue additional plays of this. It is very likely that I will sell my NIS copy of the game. If I want to play a light card game I would choose another one over Seven Dragons.

I actually really enjoy the game with all 5 dragons being played. If it's only 2 people it comes down to who gets the first chain, and if you can snag their dragon beforehand. Once it gets to 5 it becomes more entertaining.

I'm a huge fan of Larry Elmore art. That's about all I like about this game though. Game play is bland. I also can't stand the fact that you can rotate and trade goals with other players. What is this, the Mad Magazine game??

This is a gorgeous card game with a bit of strategy involved to place your dragons in a way that will get you a victory. If there's one minor complaint are the constant cards to swap goals, swap hands ... etc ... it makes it a little frustrating - but I guess it adds another dimension to the game. We'll have to play Seven Dragons more to be able to see if that mechanism works better in terms of strategy and gameplay. In all - a great, easy, fast, and fun game for two. Will definitely need to play with more than two!

Objectively, I know this isn't a "great" game, but I really enjoy it. The art is nice and it plays quick. I like that the goals can shift, but that they don't shift randomly - has to be done by a player.

This is just a good card game to pass the time.

A lot of fun to play with my family.  I've read that some people don't care for the chaos that results from the Action cards.  I play this with my daughter and we love that element of the game.  For us, it adds a tactical element as well as some fun "take that!" moments.

RATING: 4
An okay filler with some cool visuals, if nothing else. Can feel a little chaotic and Uno-ish as goals are being traded around between players. Also suffers from the Munchkin problem where you bash on the leader until people run out of ways to do so. I enjoy this game, but it's not a top tier filler, by any means.

An excellent game that's easy to play and remember the rules. You simply connect the dragons in any arrangement that will yield a connected set of 7 matching colored dragons. This game comes with a section in the rulebook devoted to teaching the game to very young children. The goal cards are really what make the game. You usually can't keep your goal...others will steal it or it may get traded away...so you never know exactly what set of dragons you will be stuck with. 

This is also an updated version of the game Aquarius.

Great Game!  Larry Elmore artwork, which also makes the game colorful and beautiful, rather than distracting (as I find with Aquarius Card Game).  Different ways to play (besides the standard), which can cater to much much younger players.  Still challenging for veteran gamers.  Games can be very quick.  Part mindless game, part "stay on your toes"-be flexible-bluff-scheme game.  A different game than Aquarius because of at least 6 new elements. I thick-sleeved this game right away because good shuffling is necessary, and that little ones would also play throughout the years to come.  I bought this on a super-strong hunch after viewing a live demo; love at first sight.  My first Looney Labs game.  Also my first game review-comment on BGG.

The game is what I expected from a quick filler with the exception of the card quality, which is terrible. After carrying it around and playing it for 1 day at school, the goal cards all have identifying marks, and a lot of the cards have ticks on the edges. I take very good care of my games so this one just seems to be really shoddy quality. Sleeves are a must!

Simple filler abstract domino game, with a pasted on dragon theme. I do like dragons, but in here, it somewhat decreases the general clarity. 

As for the game itself, it's too random to get attached to your "setup" and well-timed action play (usually the target color change) is winning the game for you. Nothing particularly bad here for a game of this sort, but nothing particularly good either.

RATING: 10
Pros:
* Very fast setup
* Portable
* Plays very well with 2, 3 or 4 (haven't tried 5)
* Simple rules allow for fun house rule tweaks.
* Lots of direct player-to-player interaction (action cards, bluffing, blocking)
* Just the right amount of luck
* Tense; quick; random in a fun way; fun even if you lose.

Cons:
* If you get bent out of shape by luck or chaos in a game, don't even bother.
* 2 player may not be as much fun without house rules.

Other:
* Our cat Lisa used to "play" this game with us. After she passed, the game earned a special place in our hearts. While we do legitimately love the game, it's possible our sentimental attachment to it has some part in that.

= 2014-05-04 - R:10

This is our most played game. Yes, we do it for sentimental reasons, but we also love the game and don't see it ever getting old. We play with a custom variant that works very well for us as a two player game.

Love it and never get tired of it? Must be a 10.

Enjoying this one quite a bit right now. My wife asked to play it three separate times yesterday; burned the bbq during the last game.

Seems better (best?) with 3, but still fun with 2 (as long as you pay attention to the rules about how "Rotate Goals" and "Swap Goals" work).

= 2012-10-07 - R:9

Changing to a 9. We play this almost every weekend morning with breakfast. In our 2p games, we've House Ruled a couple of things.

[-](1) With the Rotate and Swap Goals cards, we don't allow you to force your opponent to give up his goal.[/-]

(2) We also allow you to trade in any two cards to get a replacement. This can be done as many times as you'd like and doesn't count as your turn. You must discard face up and your opponent may look at all discarded cards.

= 2013-01-27

Still playing this one on weekend mornings with breakfast and it's still a 9. We've changed our house rules a bit. It turns out being able to take the other person's goal is half the strategy/fun and contributes to your ability to bluff so House Rule (1) above has been removed. (2) is still in effect and we've added a new one.

(3) Before the first card is played, if you have any action cards, you may insert them back into the deck and draw replacements.

= 2013-07-13

If this isn't our most played game, it's quickly getting there. Between my last entry and this one, our dear cat Lisa passed away from cancer (in March). We used to make her a part of this game by showing her our goal cards and having her wish us luck. She would pay quite a bit of attention and you could often guess someone's goal by how Lisa reacted to it. For reasons I can't remember, we had decided that the blue dragon was Lisa's favorite and so we'd sometimes play to "win for Lisa" even if we'd figured out neither of us was blue.

After Lisa passed, we continued these traditions. We place a photo of her on the table and show her our goals, but now we've got a new variant that's probably the largest departure from the base rules so far.

(4) The blue goal is removed from the game. If you have any cards with blue in your hand, you must play one of those cards, an action card or the rainbow dragon.

While we had intended for this to be a silly way to pretend Lisa was playing the game with us, we've actually found it to be an effective way to add a "dummy" player to the game and also adds some interesting new bluffing strategies. Did I play that blue card there before I had to or because it also had yellow on it and that's my color?

In addition to this new rule, we've also tweaked (2) so you can only trade in action cards. We've also modified the "Trade Hands" rules so instead of it's normal power, you discard any 3 cards and draw 3 new ones. This has on occasion been a useful way to get an excessive number of blue cards out of your hand if you're using the (4) house rule.

This game might not deserve as high a rating as we've given it, but it's become our family game and we have a strong sentimental attachment to it.

[-]Oh, I also checked the rules and discovered we've been playing a rule "wrong" (I put wrong in quotes because we decided to continue playing it our way and therefore didn't really consider our version wrong). When we play a action card and wish to use it to change the color of the silver dragon, we place that card on top of the silver dragon. Until such time that a card has been placed on the dragon, it's still wild. The official rules indicate that the color of the top card in the discard pile (which can only be action cards in the official rules) determines the color of the silver dragon and therefore it can only stay wild until the first action card is played. Our version allows action cards to be played while leaving the dragon wild.[/-]

I may have been wrong about this. The official rules seem to allow you to leave the Silver Dragon wild.

E kártyajáték célja a célkártyánkon megjelölt színű sárkányokból 7-et összefüggően lerakni az asztalra. A kártyákat dominószerűen tesszük le. A színes sárkányos kártyákon kívül vannak akciókártyák, amik elég rendesen megkavarják a játékot, ezért stratégiát nem igazán lehet benne tervezni. Számomra fölöslegesen erősnek tűnnek ezek a kártyák. Lehet ez a játék is többet mutatna többen, ketten nem igazán tetszett és nem is az én típusom az ilyen játék.

Nice game of placing cards to form a contiguous block of your secret target colour, and trying to block other player's attempts at the same.

Simple Looney Labs filler game, short, fast, fun, and some minimal strategy. Exact same game as Aquarius, but with new, beautiful artwork and one new card (which you can get as an add-on if you have Aquarius already). 

I like this game much better than the more popular Fluxx games from Looney Labs, because it is an abstract game with more strategy, though it's equally as light and short as the Fluxx games. This is great for small children 5 and up, as if they can count to 7, they can pretty much play this game and think about strategy. I think of this as a must-have filler game that all gamers should have on their shelves.

The core part of the game -- laying down the cards and working toward making a chain of dragons in your hidden color -- is just OK, maybe a 5 at best.  But then you start adding in Fluxx-like chaos where you're swapping cards and goals around, and it defeats whatever purpose there was in putting any actual thought into the game.  That it's designed by Andrew Looney doesn't surprise me in the least.

Classic game. To me, THIS is Looney Labs best game, NOT Fluxx. Tile (card) laying game of match 7 of your color. Throw in a few action cards and this is a very smooth, easy to pick up and play game with quite a few tactical decisions.

Decent game but seems a little too simple.  I would love to see this as a tile game.

I have played this game four times, all four times the people who didn't strategies, who didn't even plan out any moves won. The action cards when utilized eliminates almost all the strategy with this game. 

This is a ok light filling, the problem the games has if you utilize the action cards abilities the game can be described as this. "Play down any card any matching spot, every turn you don't need to think about anything. Then when you see 2 or 3 dragons almost assembled (7), then utilize some cards hope the game will randomly end with you winning." 

The game is not chaotic, chaotic is when things get challenging, and change constantly to create adaptability. This on the other hand is pure lay down any card any place at any time & your likelihood of wining is the same as any other persons.

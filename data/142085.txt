Something similar to 'History of the World' (same designers).
Positive: well done, general rules ok.
Interesting mechanic: players with different powers but with opposite development during the game (Heathen players have good conditions early in the game vs Hebrew ones only later).
Negative: almost random choice of kingdoms, limited actions can happen for Heathen players, waiting times can be long. Meeples too big for the regions in the board game.
Anyway I'd like to play again.

Some interesting mechanics adding some complexity to what is a variation of History of the World. We played with 6 players and the downtime was way to long. We were all playing this for the first time and it took 6 hours+ to play. Some players were doing nothing for an hour as they had cards right at the start of Book 1 and then towards the end of Book 2. Not great. More familiarity with the rules would probably speed this up a lot, but there is no player interaction.

After one play, lots to like: strong narrative without being too constraining, variety in the setup, lots to think about strategically across the Book and tactically across the turn. Unfortunately there is a lot of down time as your turns come irregularly; and the play time, especially with newbies, seems to long to fit easily into an evening. Great game if you have the time, would work very well by email.

Lucky to be asked to play test mid way through design process. Only played the basic game but end results were very close. Description of the full game sounded like there was a lot more flesh on the bones.

I look forward to playing the full game sometime.

Play #2: With the full game now and 5 players, 2 heathen and 3 Hebrews.  With 5 players the 'team' of 3 only get 2 cards each but have 4 actions per card, the Heathens get 3 cards each but 3 actions each.

As before the Heathen get off to a slow start compared to the Hebrews with less units on the board per card. As a result, attacking opportunities are restricted and in this game The Hebrews efficiently pounced on lands with Patriarchs significantly cutting the Heathens revenue. This restricts the purchase of artefacts and progress on the royal track.

Not sure if 5 is the sweet spot as the Hebrews crushed the heathens scores and although the Hebrews only had 4 lands on the board at game end the points were nearly 20 apart from 2nd to 3rd. Needs a replay where the experts can demonstrate how its done with the Heathens.

A lot more to think about with the full game.

Game 3 and the Heathens had a far better showing owing to some rule tweaks. The random set up of the Royal and Kingdom tracks along with the variety of the artifacts means that the experience will always be different for every play.

My copy of the KS game received 10th Dec 2013.

Wow. What an interesting game! A mix of mechanics built beautifully and well-integrated into a much loved theme for me! Lots to explore in strategy and even some in tactics as well. My only real complaint is possibly the time it takes, both between turns and overall. I'd love more Bible games like this though!

RATING: 8.5
Great 'area control game'.  Although you play in teams, it's not really a team game as each player is trying to win by manipulating one of two main factions, The Hebrews and The Heathens.  It's got a unique mechanic in that no-one owns either major faction or the kingdoms within them, you just need to manipulate them for your own ends.

Although this is an area control game, the areas you are controlling and the units you are using potentially change each turn.  You really have to make the most out of every move.

The more I play this game, the more I like it.

Not sure how I feel about this one.  One play at 3-player makes me wonder about how balanced the game is, and how scripted it could turn out to be once everyone got well acquainted with the cards.  The final stages of the game seem almost anticlimactic, as the Hebrews have virtually no resources with which to engage in conquest, and the heathens have tons of forces available but potentially no objectives to achieve.

If the Hebrew players are anywhere close to the Heathens when Book 3 commences, the value of the cards almost makes it impossible for the Heathens to have a chance.  Not sure how I feel about that.  More plays might show a way to mitigate this feeling of inevitability.

Quite a lot to like in this scenario-like reboot of 'A History of the World' (by the same designers) but a couple of concerns.

An interesting 'teams' but everyone for themselves mechanic mixed with development track pushing and old-fashioned dice based territorial conquest and a good use and engagement with it's theme.

The concerns are play length, which I can't see coming down to below 3 hours with four players (which the game really needs) and potential downtime between turns.

Players take the turns of Heathen and Hebrew nations, fighting over pieces of the Promised Land during the times of the Old Testament.  A truly wonderful game, featuring the History of the World card/empire engine and expansion rules, combined with modern Euro point scoring mechanics.  The rules take a few turns to fall into place, and the attractive board is very cluttered, but the game play is superb.  Long, but rewarding.  The Ragnars do it again.

I hated this, massive amounts of downtime, at one point I waited 45mins for my turn, next time I play I'll make sure to have a good book to hand. Seems strange that a fairly heavy wieght game has such random elements, I'm thinking of the card allocation and then you just roll a dice and see if you can get higher than someone else, makes planning next to impossible.

While this reminds me a bit of "Euphrat & Tigris", aswell as "Vinci", it doesn't offer the same amount of fun. It feels unbalanced and is complicated in some ways, which doesn't help the game at all.

Enjoyable and interesting old-school game.

A bit long for what it is, though: My first game (three players) still lasted about 3.5 hours, which is a bit high for this. In addition, game time is bound to go up with the addition of more players.

Playing as a lone Hebrew player (and winning convincingly), I wonder whether play balance might be better with four players. OK, I was pretty lucky with my nation cards - that helped - but still; having perfect cooperation between both Hebrew factions presented quite a bit of challenge for my opponents.

Bottom line; fun game, but probably too long to get played often...

Tentative rating. 6 players is only recommended for very quick players, 4 is a good number, and probably 2 as well. I like the two very different kinds of actions: expanding your only-one-turn civilization at first, and then installing your patriarchs on productive and safe lands. A negative point maybe is that your strategy completely depends on the cards you take.

Probably the game is too long, over the average of the heavy eurogames, but the theme is real, you can feel the expansion and defeat of Hebrew people. The scoring is very well-balanced. Finally, I like the 2 options for combats, with dices or without.

Due to time constraints we only played 2 of the 3 books.  So my rating is tentative.  My reservation about the game is that I didn't have much fun.

I was one of three heathen players.  My biggest force was 3 counters.  I just didn't have enough to do, and that was paired with long waits for the turns to roll around.

I think I would prefer a 4p game the next time I tangle with this.

Fits the historic arc very well. You control either Hebrew or Heathen tribes, but 'you' are effectively an extended family of farmers, traders, priests trying to make a living despite the disruption of tribes around you waging war on each other. Major problem is the downtime especially with the unusual turn order which in a 6 player game can leave you doing nothing for around an hour at a time. Best played with 2 (if I can ever persuade a second person to join me.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Probably a two player game. The massive amount of downtime between some turns is not helped by poor graphic design on the artefact cards that slows the pace still further. There's a good game in there but I think you need the right people, the right number of them and the right approach to enjoy it.

'A land of milk and honey' on the side: funny.  Looks very nice and good quality.  The cloth map quite nice: wish I'd not ruined one of my cards already with a drop of soda.  Game play reminiscent of History of the World but with very interesting scoring mechanics.  Some of the rules took us some time to decipher but we think we have it right now.  Certainly want to play again.

May '16: rating increased.  Also elements of their Kings and Castles design.  There is some luck of the draw but the order the Kingdom tiles come out influence the game in interesting ways.

Positives:

- 2 vs. 2 was pretty cool

Negatives:
- way too much downtime in a 4-player game
- boring dice rolling combat (no dice variation found in the rules might fix that)
- some tiles didn't have any visual clues of their effect so you need to constantly check the rules
- duration too long for a game like this

Great looking, pretty straight forward conflict game with a great theme. In many ways it reminds me of Vinci (but longer and more complex of course). Really like the team aspect. Played with five players first time - big mistake! The downtime was horrible. I guess the ideal pace is found with two players, but to get the whole team dynamic I'd suggest four players (four non-AP:ers though).

We have played several times. I find the 2 or 4 player version to be very balanced. For some reason, we have never seen the Hebrews win (not even close) in a 3 player game.

The game is similar to Vinci with a touch of History of the World. There is a learning curve in that knowledge of the various tiles and how they may affect the game is critical. The limitation on the number of tiles allowed to be played each turn results in some agonizing decisions.

There is a lot here and each play reveals more.

Lots to like. Thematic and nicely produced. The drawing of cards for turn order is clever. Variety of upgrades and bonus tiles adds replayability. I do wonder about the length and downtime. Played with four, and I imagine the full game would typically be more than three hours. I suppose that would be less of a problem with 3 players, but then you lose the tidy 2 vs 2 format. Worth exploring further.

A magnificent tweaking of the civilisation selection in History of the World (and A Brief History of the World), form the basis of this excellent game. Three times players will choose a small number of civilisations which will then be played in card number order. Take that group and spend the assigned tokens to expand geographically, or build a city or temple, or simply take money. Then perform a limited number of actions to expand your income base on the map, or achieve certain assigned goals, or buy your way along the Kingdom track. Then take income and finish off your turn with an artefact purchase.

It's all gloriously interwoven, simple, challenging and fun. Everything is worth points. Most things give you further abilities. By doing one thing you're sacrificing advancement in another area. Nothing is an obvious move. The choices are meaningful and significant to your future plans. Balance is handled by the player interaction, but the starting point and ongoing card income and action numbers seems about right. Artefacts are not too powerful and are varied enough to make choices interesting. The three different currencies prevents income generation from being too simple - instead it feels just right.

Possibly prone to a bit of analysis paralysis, but I expect that with experience the pace of the game will pick up nicely.

Definitely a game to keep.

I like this (final?) iteration of the HOTW system. Vps dependent on fulfilling goals, and the purchase of artefacts, with the ability to do this based on placement of Patriarchs not just the land occupied by your armies. It adds another layer to think about, as does the one use artefacts  and benefits of the kingdom track.

Strong theme (which the graphics nicely complement), rules somewhat obscure (with some real head-scratchers), and a player-aid would have been nice too. In other words, a typical Kickstarter release.

Still, this game is multi-layered and a helluva lot of fun to play (think 'History of the World' on steroids). Players who didn't like it expressed concern about tedium and downtime.  

The designers do borrow heavily from other games, including their own, but everything is interwoven together to form a mostly satisfying experience.

A very impressive piece of game design.  Lots of interlocking mechanisms with plenty of interesting decisions at all phases of the game. 

A beautiful narrative arc to this game too.  It also handles difficult/asymmetric player counts in a quite innovative fashion.

First 3player game clocked in at four hours, but I can see that reducing to 3hours if I ever get another game in.  A large investment of time, but worth it.  Has a similar 'feel' to God's Playground.  

Only reservation is the downtime between turns.  I can see this getting extreme at the 4+ player mark, as individual turns are quite long and complex.

A good game, but very similar in many ways to History of the World.

I am a bit concerned that no one really has very much control, and that winner is really determined mostly by a few lucky breaks.

I have only tried a late prototype version of the game, but really enjoyed it. Players play either Heathen or Hebrew tribes throughout the ancient history of the region, as narrated by the Old Testament. This rich theme is added to a blend of worker placement, resource management and dice combat mechanics. Looking forward to seeing the published version with proper graphics.

RATING: N/A
Good solid game with plenty to do. Rules take a bit of working out, but nothing severe, and it all makes sense once you start playing. Components nice and solid - I have the Kickstart wooden pieces, but apart from the Patriarchs I didn't use them, I find the city, temple & ark are too big. I did use the teatowel map though, I love those...

One thing - this is not a wargame, the elements of direct conflict are an inadequare simulation of the forces involved for that category, but it does involve quite a bit of strategic thinking and careful use of forces.

In play, the map will fill up quickly with higher numbers of players, so there will be a lot of conflict, and a lot of alliance building & breaking - there are two teams, Heathen vs. Hebrew, as well as individual tribes - and the balance of power shifts during the game. At the start, the Hebrew player(s) will easily overwhelm their neighbours, spreading out quickly. But in the endgame, they'll be lucky to survive... In fact, they get points just for still being on the map at all at the end!

Really like this game, lots to do & see.

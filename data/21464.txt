Fairly simple but quite interesting set collection game.
Quite abstract really with strange and uninteresting pasted on theme.
Can't see it hitting the table much.
2 player, took about an hour.

RATING: 6
The manly art of home decor, in a board game.  I feel like seating position plays too big a role in this one, as being early in the turn order usually means you can't afford to buy the tiles you want, then the guy two seats to your left gets them at a discount.  Fast and pretty fun though.

California is a very well done filler with a bit of thought required, but it just doesn't grab me in the way that China/WoP and Hansa do. I really like Schact's designs for the most part (cough... Kontor) so I will keep playing this game. I don't think I'll be purchasing it anytime soon though.

Initial rating after one game. The game presents a series of issues to you - the choice of gold or tiles(something like Atlantic Star); placement on your room mat (a simpler form of Princes of Florence) and some additional targets for you to achieve. Overall feel is a quick game (our 4 player game lasted 40 minutes) and pretty enjoyable.

RATING: 7
A fun, quick game.  Not very deep or strategic, but excellent for what it is.  Scales decently up to 5, though I suspect 3 or 4 is the sweet spot.  Not too long.  Gameplay is quick and simple.  Probably a decent introductory (gateway) game.  In the 5pl I played, scores were very tight at the end (I won by 1 point).  I would expect (hope for) more differentiation with fewer players, particularly since people are likely to have more turns and a bit more control.

So I've only played this once and it was a three person game. It was a really boring game  where you had to choose between picking up money or paying money to pick up tiles to "furnish your home" to be the first to make certain sets  and also get gift-points from buxom "guests". There was an artificial spatial tile placement restriction which did not remove too much slack from the game. While there were some decisions to be made, it was an underwhelming experience. The theme is boring, the decisions are not always hard and I can't imagine why I would ever play this game again when there are hundreds of super fun light fillers already in my collection. blech...

Not much here, but good for a play every now and then. Kids will enjoy it too - my 7-year-old likes this one. If you do play it with your kids, be sure to tell them that living in a mansion in California, entertaining moochers, and drawing from one's trust fund rather than working is okay in board games, but not in real life.

The best reference game I can come up with is Alhambra.  I find this is shorter, but not too short.  Lighter, but not too light.  Finally, I think the theme is much better.  It's less a case of "feeling" the theme, and more how people are observant of it and appreciate the lightness of its implementation.  Seems to go over great with gamers and non-gamers alike.  Make sure to note that the bonus tiles are for furniture, not carpet!

It arrived at 10:30, I opened and punched it, read the rules, and we were playing at 11:30. A strangely fun game, but one that it isn't immediately obvious how to play. And talk about a thin veneer of theme...

RATING: 6.5
This game flys under most people's radar for some reason.  It is not clear exactly why.  Game play is easy to explain and the game plays fairly quickly.  There is a definite feel of familiarity with the game and that is likely the drawback -  there is nothing particularly spectacular about the game.  The primary game mechanics are solid but not original.  The graphic design of the game is acceptable but not stellar.  The theme is functional but not engaging.  While nothing stands out, that doesn't make the game bad or even average - it is a good game.  It's just that everytime you think about some aspect of the game you're compelled to add a "but" to every statement.  Thus it's a good game, but...

Under-rated Schacht game. Tile stacks like Hansa and Zooloretto as well as placement similar to Zoo. Save up to get gifts at the right times. Pay more to get first pick, wait and pay less for what is left. Fun game. I think it would work great as a gateway game.

Some good moving parts in the engine, but nothing really interesting going on overall.  I might play it again if I had a few drinks in me, but otherwise not so much.  Strangely had a Vegas Showdown feel to it, but without the interesting Amun-Re-ish bidding.

RATING: 6
I actually enjoy this game quite a bit.  There are multiple different strategies, and therefore you can take many paths to victory.  The flaw to the game is that there really isn't much theme here.  The method of calculating how much you must pay for items is simple but makes no thematic sense.  It's worth it if you can pick it up for cheap, but I certainly wouldn't rush to get it.

Pretty light and fun. Wife completely destroyed me in our first game.

Still fun after 3 plays, although we have yet to play correctly. We read the 2-player rule where the game ends when a player has 9 or more points in cards, but didn't see that the game is played out until the end of the current day -- we ended it immediately. Oops.

After more plays, I'm enjoying this a lot. It plays smoothly, it's light and good for a semi-quick game.

Okay economic game.  Luck-heavy.  Has a "race to win tiles" element.  Typical feeling of so much to do with so few actions (or not enough money).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Definitely would recommend this with 4 or 5 players.  There needs to be lots of competition to make this one as drawn out as possible.  At 2 players it just becomes a race to see who is lucky enough to have their room tile become available first.

Rather disappointed in this one.  However, only one play.  There is a conflict between speciallization (which gets the 3 point tiles) and diversification (which gets the gifts).  The money mechanism isn't as elegant as I thought it would be.  Ending a round seems to be an advantage.

The theme makes absolutely no sense when associated with California. 

First of all, if you get a house in California, you can't afford to renovate or buy furniture. If you paid for the house, you're already broke. Even if you inherited the house, the property taxes will break you.

Second, and most important, neighbors will NOT come over to welcome you in California, much less bring gifts. We hosted our own house-warming party, inviting all the new neighbors, and only 2 even acknowledged the invitation. A mansion in the hills would be secluded, requiring neighbors to drive over and get through a security gate.

I bought this based on it's recommendation in the Games 100 issue from last year - got it for cheap, so I wasn't expecting much.  It's a pretty simple game, but I think it's also underrated.  It's a nice filler, and getting the guests to your house is fun in a stupid kind of way.  Not amazing, but Schact's designs really fill a nice niche - simple, elegant, but often quite challenging (or at least moreso than you'd expect, given the simplicity).

It's a light family game that plays quickly, and for the right group, it's just great.

It feels like it would probably be best with 3 or 4 players.

We played with 5 players which is definitely the wrong number for this game. With a max of 10 actions before the day ends, the same player is guaranteed to always be the last player unless someone chooses to end the day early. Also, with 5 players, scoring furniture bonuses becomes too dependant on the luck of the draw, turn order and other players actions.

(Rating: 4 or 5 with 5 players. 6 or 7 with fewer players? )

A really light game. I would not recommend it for the gamer crowds, but I think it goes perfectly well with people who are into TTR already. It is a very fun lightweight game with not very many strategic decisions to do. It mostly comes down to buy something or take some money but making things cheaper. It can also be very quick paced. I can only see the game taking 60 minutes (as advertised on the box) if you have all 5 players and you have one or two slow players. Another bonus is that it does play decently well 2 player.

Add floor space to your mansion on which to build items which attracts guests who may leave gifts.  The cost of floor and items is relative to the amount of money available and for floors, another coin or two depending on the floor space cost.  Bonus points for certain groupings, points for covered spaces, gifts, and negative points for loans.
Better with more than 2 players.

Rating based on 2-player. I think it will be better with 3. It's the kind of game where the number of players makes a huge difference in how it is played. My husband and I really like this after only 2 plays. The theme is cool, there's plenty of strategy, and yet it's really simple and elegant. Love the theme, good quality components. LATER: I have played it with 3 players now and it's quite different. I think I like it better as a 2 player, but it's good with 3 as well. The strategy is significantly different with 3.  LATER: Just finished playing it as a 3 player with my 7 year old. I was surprised by how easily he learned the game. So, as others have said it's definitely playable with younger kids if they're interested.

Components: Sturdy components all around, and nice artwork for the guests. However, the rest of the artwork (coins, floor tiles, mansions, gifts, and store) is unattractive and, along with an uninteresting theme, detract from the game.

Experience: The central mechanism of buy something at the current price, or take coins but therefore lower the price, is one I'd like to see Schacht use again, to better effect. There were seldom competitions for tiles, and many times when it was clear that a player had insufficient funds to buy a tile and would therefore need to take a coin. I never got the sense that I was particularly invested in collecting a specific type of tile, nor did the theme make me feel that I was renovating and furnishing a mansion.

Has two things going for it.  Firstly, it plays quickly.  That is a huge benefit when the game is so samey.  Secondly, it puts Estimated Prophet into my head.  On the downside, every round played out pretty much exactly the same in our five player game, as the round started again within one spot of me in all twelve rounds.  That needed to rotate around more.

Not a bad filler, but this game alone doth not a whole game night make.  I admit that, because I live in California, I bought it mainly for the name.  It's supposed to be similar to Zooloretto, but I find that I like Zooloretto better, and not just because I work in a Zoo.  Now that I own Zooloretto, I really don't need this game.  Traded for Artifact.

RATING: 7
This is an interesting game where a player can take one of the 4 coins from the bank or buy one of the 8 tiles from the mall. If there are 4 coins, each tile costs $4. If you take a coin so that 3 coins remain, each tile costs $3. And so on. The very act of replenishing your funds makes it easier for your opponents to purchase the tiles you need before your turn comes around again

RATING: 7
Can't really decide if I should give this a 6 or a 7, but I'll go with 7 for now. 

On one hand it's a nice little filler with a fun theme. Nothing new here but still an ok game. What makes me want to lower the rating is the fact that there seems to be very few actual decisions to make. What to do each turn is quite obvious most of the time.

Update: Down to a 6, lots of better tile laying games out there.

This game is easy to teach, fast, simple, and fun.  Most games take longer to play than what they advertise.  This game actually takes less.  With 4 players who have played before, it plays in 30 minutes.  So it makes great filler.  Also, there are moments that get the table laughing...like when you have to put a swimming pool in the attic because you don't have room for it in your mansion.  Only played once, but...this along with "For Sale" are my top choices for filler.

Not great, but certainly fun enough as you design and redecorate your awesome California mansion.  Shelley loves to get the dog, though why it only goes on the green floor is a mystery.  I do like the "take money, but make things cheaper for your opponents, or pay a high price" mechanic.  Probably BEST with 3.

ugh!!! i've only played 5er, but not enough there to see if
it is better with fewer numbers. no control. no choices, no strategy,
no tactics, just make the move that the board gives you and hope
the random/chaos fates shine on you. game time of 20 minutes felt like
an hour. So the positive is 'the game does make time stand still'.

California is a decent tile laying game.  To me it felt similar to Zooloretto but better.  It's pretty good in that it's a quick game with a some decent decision making.  It's interesting to watch how rounds play out depending on what tiles are placed in the stores.  You could have a round with people taking a lot of money and then buying stuff cheap, but every now and again store tiles will cause a store to empty and much faster than money is taken.  This also scales well within it's number of players.  Overall it's a good tile laying game, but there are many better games with this mechanism.

Good, light filler. Tight decision-making, like all Schacht games. The winner here is that the game is not dry at all, but reasonably engaging. I think it helps that the game plays quickly and is not bogged down by AP. 

However, luck of the draw and turn order can be crucial, and could potentially land a player a big coup.

It's quick, the bidding is interesting enough, and my girlfriend likes it.  I basically bought it for the Sims-ish theme, though, and I have to admit that I was a little disappointed with the lack of variety in the items and such.

RATING: 7.5
I enjoyed this despite playing poorly. The basic mechanisms of taking money but reducing the price for others, and choosing between what you really want and can't afford and what forces the day to end early work together nicely. The luck of the draw can favour some, and maybe it plays better with less than 5 players, but this is an interesting game and worth trying out. *** Played again as a 2-player game and we messed up the end game conditions, but it stills works very well for two.

I usually like Schacht games, but not this one. Too many little actions. It's a very good mechanism the one that make you decide to take a coin or buy a tile, but I think it's a little bit wasted for this medium light game. I'd like to see this mechanism in a heavier game.

My husband and I enjoyed our first two games of California, even though we played incorrectly the first time. (We took bonus tiles after placing renovation tiles instead of waiting until we placed furnishing tiles.) The second time, using the correct rule, was much better. The solid design does not seem to provoke over-analysis while still offering meaningful decisions.  The component quality and visual appeal are good. The game might be better with more players, but we think that the two-player  experience is fine.

A decent little strategy game with some element of luck. React to the cards dealt, take out loans as needed and take the points where you can get them. When I played this game, I did an excellent job of demonstrating how NOT to do it. I got tunnel vision about a specific set I wanted to complete and never got the right cards. In the meantime, I let many other opportunities for "guest" points, etc., slide by. My mansion was nicely furnished, however, and was featured briefly in "Home & Garden."

Michael Schacht at his best.  As in every Schacht game, a simple mechanism propels the game quickly to its conclusion with very narrow, tightly-controlled options offered to the players.  This Schachtian topography often makes me feel like nothing more than an agent of fate, but here in California the lay of the land feels right for the game.  You're usually pursuing different goals that beckon you in many directions, timing is critically important, and you need to pay attention to inhibiting the other players.  Together, these factors make for some interesting (although light) choices. I also enjoy playing up the stupid theme of inviting your posh, materialistic friends over to see how awesome your possessions are.

I've encountered a wide gulf in opinions on this game.  Some friends have found the game charming.  Others have complained that the it didn't offer enough opportunity for thoughtful play or strategy.  My response to the second group of players is, "Well of course!"  California isn't a thoughtful, strategic game.  It's a minor game.  Approach it like you'd approach Coloretto or Geschenkt, and then see what you think.

A light game with familiar mechanics. Very simple and fast. On your turn, take money or buy a tile. The original touch is that you reduce the price of tiles for your opponents when you take money.

A well put together very quick eurogame...  highly abstract with an obnoxious theme pasted on.  Tile laying/buying with a nifty cost mechanism and several different ways to score.

Typical Schacht-very simple, almost minimalist, with plenty of tension and constant worry about whether you are helping yourself or your opponent.  I like it quite a bit. It's tempting to put it in the Zooloretto family of games because of the tile placement rules, but the drafting is quite different and the simplicity is a little greater (and for Schacht games, this is a good thing). Good with two because the relationship between your house and your opponent's is so close.  Much less control with more players. (3 plays)

Nothing special or out of the ordinary, but an amusing theme.  Fairly standard tile laying game with very simple rules and a few interesting choices to make.  One needs to be very careful about picking up money, since you not only do not acquire a tile, but you also make tile buying cheaper for everyone else.  My wife remarked that this would be a good intro to German games, and I heartily agree.  I think I would enjoy this more if everyone was already familiar with the game, creating a faster play time.  This could potentially be filler-length, which is where I would most like to see it.

I originally bought this game in an attempt to seduce some of my girl friends into board gaming with me.  What I didn't foresee is how I wouldn't like the game.  I hated the colour scheme, and the mechanics didn't draw me in.  At one point I thought about decking it out with glass tiles from the dollar store, but I didn't like the game enough to do so.

The most fun I had with California is when I decorated the house outside of a game.

After playing this several times, I felt dissatisfied.  The game is reasonably fun and moves along quickly, but with twelve rounds it is a little long and involved to be considered a "light filler."  The strategic choices it presents do not seem very rich for a medium-length game, however.  For example, the strategy of tiling is almost trivial.

RATING: 8
The theme is interior design but it's really a tile laying light strategy game.  Do you take money and make things less costly for your opponents?  Or, do you spend now, buy the tiles you really want and hope your opponents make things cheaper?  It's works very well in theme and there are some interesting choices to make throughout the game.  In any case, I really like it but best with three (four if you include the expansion tiles).  It compares favorable with Alhambra and I suspect I like this more b/c it has similar gameplay and decisions in a much, much shorter time.

Fairly enjoyable, quick playing, tile/set collection type of game/filler.  The variable cost of the tiles based on the bank's quantity of money is an interesting twist.  Pay more to get what you want or take money to make the cost go down and to gain money.

We received this from a math trade and it had some positive reviews as a nice gateway game.  Plus, we had just moved from California so the theme was pretty welcoming (especially after a cold winter in the Northeast).  However, in the end it just didn't hook us.  It felt a little like a warmed over cross between [GAMEID=6249] (buying the tiles) and [GAMEID=33154] (match specific room recipes).  

The large number of available tiles for purchase makes the two player game feel way too open so there's less chance of any tension or the other player being able to affect you.  We also really miss the lack of a dummy Dirk player as a way to affect each other as well.  As a result, it's far too easy to complete the various "room recipes", so quite a few of our games finished as an automatic win for one player.  I'm sure that there is some optimal path between taking more money or buying tiles, but it just didn't feel like it really mattered in the two player game.

Unlike [GAMEID=6249], this one is probably better with more than two, where there is actually more competition for the tiles and guests.

Update: we just played this with three players and it was a completely different game---it was so much better! With three, suddenly there's more tension with buying tiles first---will they even be there by the time it gets back to you? Should you take the money but make everything cheaper? Taking the loans suddenly become a good tactic---maybe you need the extra cash this turn to get a specific tile. Much, much better and we'll probably never play it with two again. Rating upgraded.

Great, easy game to teach.  Fast to play, a 5-player game can be finished in 15 minutes, with plenty of decisions for everyone.  HIGH SCREW-YOUR-NEIGHBOR factor, so if you don't like a quick game with potential for getting hosed, you won't like California.  If you don't mind getting hosed in a game that lasts only 15 minutes, then you might enjoy this game a lot.  

Dumb theme.... I mean, California is a little weird, Germans are weird, but German concepts about what California really is are just bizarre!  Ugly artwork, klunky connections to the theme in terms of the mechanics, but somehow, a fun, great game make in part because of the awful theming... almost a "it's so bad it's good" situation.

I like that this is a fast game (under and hour) that's easy to teach but has some tough choices.  In this game of timing and efficiency players are redecorating their houses and trying to attract guests.  The big points, from what I've seen, are in the bonus tiles where players are racing to complete certain tasks first (these involve being the first to furnish the house a specific way).  Take the money (which you'll need) or purchase a tile before others do?

Overall I like the strategy & decision making you have to do. It's all about obtaining what you need or sacrificing that to block another player from getting bonus points. Or just forcing the day to end when needed. It does have 2 player rules that prevents the game from going on for hours. With more players, it is certainly going to be a winner. I give it an 8 out of 10

California is a harmless Euro with the silly theme of tricking out your mansion with expensive carpeting and expensive things to put on said carpeting. Once you get enough expensive carpeting and expensive things to put on it, you can claim one of various set-collection goals that earn you points. As soon as you've furnished [and floored] your study, billiard room, conservatory, or ballroom with a new fancy thing to show off, a Prof. Plum-ian snob will come visiting and if a Mrs. Peacock or a Miss Scarlett are already there, he'll know and bring a gift that can earn you points later. The starlets' tastes are rather fickle, however, so getting them to be there to receive a gift when Col. Mustard comes knocking to check out your new moose head plaque is a bit of a balancing act. The more interesting balancing act, however, is in the economic system Schacht chose for the game. Schacht has a lot of clever, tight monetary systems, and this is probably the best of the lot that I've played.

Every round a new set of carpeting and carpet-dwelling items are made available for purchase. The price is determined by a cute little give-and-take mechanism. A "bank" board holds four gold coins at the start of each round; on a player's turn, they either take one gold coin from the bank or pay a number of silver coins [1 gold = 5 silver] equal to the number of coins left on the bank to purchase a carpet or item tile. That is to say, choosing to take money [because you can't afford or don't want to buy anything] makes buying stuff cheaper for everyone else after you. In typical Schachtian fashion, money is extraordinarily tight, so there is a careful balancing act between surviving on slim margins and hoping the other players don't buy out the stuff you want from under you when you're forced to take money because you have none, or stockpiling up money so that you can afford to pay higher prices for better tiles before cash-poor players can get more capital. A loan system allows players to switch between these two play modes. It's a pretty tactical system, admittedly, but the tactics are interesting; it feels like a bigger Elephant In A China Shop. A shame the rest of the game is quite bland.

RATING: 6
Sure, I like it.  A more colorful Euro than Schacht's latest, and perfect for a co-ed game night.  But like many of these kinds of euros, there's nothing that stays with you afterwards.  Could almost be a filler.

RATING: 7
A Euro by Schact but this one felt like a 'cut your teeth' kind of design before he found his feet.

It's a pretty dry Euro where the aim is to decorate the interior of a Californian Mansion in the hope of attracting guests and collecting various goal tiles. 

It's really set collection at its core but not inspired in any way.

RATING: 8
Many of Schacht's designs have an aspect of inbuilt player interaction I'm quite fond of. In them, "setting the table" for the next player is often as important as making the best move for yourself. While not as central as in, say, Hansa or Richelieu, this feature can be found in California as well.
As for the theme: while some people have found the idea of renovating a mansion and attracting visitors somewhat lame, I find it original and even quite interesting. After all, there are plenty of opportunities to sabotage other players' plans if you keep your eyes open and plan well ahead.

Interesting tug-of-war for two or three. I wouldn't want to touch it with any more players, though. California is a game that rewards strategy and perseverance and - indeed - is a little bit too one-track in that direction. Unlike the best strategy games, it's very difficult to diversify or change horses in midstream. Pleasant entertainment, but no more than a time waster, really.

An average game.  It has some similarities to Zooloretto (same designer) but its the lesser of the 2 games.  I got it cheap to play with the kids and it will do fine.  I would have disappointed if I had paid full price for it.  The overall Geek rating graph is skewed at 6 and above and my GeekBuddies say 7, so I thought it would be good.  But its just ok.

I have since traded away my copy.  Zooloretto is a much better game with similar mechanics so this one just didn't come to the table.  We tried but after a while it just sat there unloved so I moved it along.

My casual gamer wife liked it at first, so that alone made it worth trading for.

An interesting game with lots of tough choices. The theme is fairly thin, but is enough to be effective. Unfortunately, it wants to be played very cutthroat, at least with 2p.

It seems to play pretty well with 2p, and seems like it could get chaotic with more, so I'm surprised that almost half of BGG voters don't recommend the game with 2. The 2p game ends early (around turn 6 so far), when either player gets 9 bonus points. It took me a while to understand the point of that rule: to force the players to block each other from getting bonuses. Since blocking is not our favorite part, we might house-rule it. On the other hand, having the games end after about 30 minutes is nice, so we might keep it.

I think the 1.8 weight is about right.

Has a fun theme - let's fix up our house and throw a party.

Some interesting points to give a bit of strategy.
Balance of getting money versus taking tiles. 
Each tile taken reduces the price for later players (when to pull the trigger).
How to lay out the rooms (tableau) to allow for growth.
When and which furniture to select to get the party bonuses and the set collection bonus.
When to end a round and force remaining tiles to be discarded.

All in all more there than meets the eye.

I agree with others - CA is an underrated gem! It's family and non-gamer friendly, it's quick, interactive, elegantly simple rules, the theme is unique and appeals to people who usually wouldn't be interested in games, good components, and it's insanely inexpensive.
Another excellent Michael Schacht game! I like the mechanics and think they are even superior to Zooloretto, since you are taking away from 8 tiles as opposed to filling trucks. It makes for more active strategy than the first turns in each day of Zoo are just getting some tiles on the trucks for later strategic play. Still think Coloretto is the strongest of his games, but CA is his 2nd-best that I've played.

Neste esboço do que mais tarde viria a ser Zooloretto, pouco sentimos a Califórnia, num jogo que até nem é mau…

Very light for a Schacht game, and also pretty thematic.  Furnish your house, collect neat stuff so that your friends will come over and you'll be popular.  Simple, interesting.  Mostly an evaluation of worth game, but no auctions are involved, and subject to player chaos and luck of the draw.  Not too sure how it will hold up to repeat plays, but I enjoyed our 2 playings.  Also, seems like the kind of game that would not hold up well with fewer than 4 players.

This game seems pointless to me.  It's super light, bland, and not much fun.  I don't care if it's a filler -- it's a bad one.  In fact, I think Monopoly is more fun, honestly.

Side note:  Blocking isn't really effective until late in the game since more tiles will continue to pop up as the game progresses, and your efforts can be overridden by turn order.

It was a waste of the $9 I spent on it.

Enjoyable game where you try to furnish your house with the most stuff first. The game masquerades as a tile-laying game, but this is really a push-your-luck game, in the vein of the designer's Coloretto series.

Enjoyed this much more than I thought I would, considering the game is cheap, ubiquitous and has bad artwork. This is Zooloretto as it should have been, because the money system fits so much better with the mechanisms (instead of just being tacked on). The unique take or spend money mechanism makes this game worth at least a try, and gives this a very Coloretto-like feel and tension, even though what you do mechanically is nothing at all like that in Coloretto. 

This game would be so much better appreciated if it had better artwork or a different theme (indeed, the Zooloretto theme would fit perfectly here; California Zoo, anybody?). Better still, go for the whole nine yards and get The Sims license, because similarity to The Sims is the only redeeming quality of the theme and artwork.

Mechanically wise, I think this game would be tenser (i.e. better) if gold coins were worth less, say 3 or 4 silver instead of 5, and if the ratio for the loans were steeper (say 3/6 instead of 3/4, or even time-sensitive, like that in El Capitan).

Very nice filler with these fixes, but I don't have time to dress and fix games up when there are so many others that, even if not near-perfect, give a lot more intriguing things to work with straight out of the box.

Quick, light and easy to grasp with a really innovative purchasing system; this is a great little dutch auction game.  It is quite simple. While often the right tiles drawn at the right time certainly dictate the shape of the game, there are enough choices that help determine whether you earn your victory or not.  I like that you are rewarded with points by competing in areas as you will get points by regaining guests, this makes up for a bitter blow to losing out on the bonus tiles.  Plus, thematically it is rather fun.  I love how cheesy it is, a nice jab against American consumerism.  I totally need to showcase two motorcycles in my house.  (This seems to be best for three).

I don't think I played this under ideal conditions: two-player with the tile-sweeping at the end of the round ignored for most of the game. It was just okay but I'd need to play again with more players and correctly. Little problems for me though are the lack of thought into the design: gold coins in California!?!; outfitting my house with a pool???; a dog could cost as much as anything else?; the bonus cards don't feel particularly thematic. And why do guests keep coming by to drop off presents if I buy a treadmill???

Not a bad little game, actually. The components (especially the artwork) are pretty cheesy, but the auctioning is pretty interesting and the game moves at a pretty good clip.

Completely abstract with a thinly pasted on theme: players have inherited a mansion that they are trying to renovate. Boards represent 16 spaces. The central area shows 2 stores with 4 randomly chosen tiles each, and a bank with four 5-gold tokens. On your turn, you can take 1 gold token, or buy 1 item from a store (price = # of tokens on bank). The round ends when any store, or the bank, are depleted. You play 11 rounds, then use the discards to draw 8 random tiles for the final 12th round.

The mechanisms are nice, but I just don't care that much about carpeting the mansion and then covering it with random similar-colored stuff. Why am I keeping a motorcycle in the house, anyway?

California is a family friendly tile laying game with a great mechanism to control costs.  Players need to balance between taking money or taking tiles.  Most scores end up being pretty close.

So far, have only played this game twice (both were 2-player, one with a hard-core gamer, one with my wife) and rated it 6.5 as it's fun to play and I would be willing to play it again. I like that you can control the price of items a bit, and that you can mess with other people by buying and storing things in your attic that they needed to complete bonuses, or taking the guests they worked so hard to get.

I don't think it's one I would play back to back, but once in a while would be fine.

I would like to play with more people to see the difference and get little bit better view of the game.

My wife's opinion is pending as she was tired and I had to withhold the 'take that' attitude a bit, so wasn't quite as fun as that's a key element that makes this a fun game (for me).

I love the mechanic/choice that dictates that refilling your money pool actually makes it cheaper for other players to buy items!

California is simple and fast-moving with few tough decisions.  In fact, learning the rules is harder than playing it (otherwise, it would be an ideal gateway game).  California has been accurately described as Zooloretto light.  Although inoffensive, there's nothing to recommend California if you've played any of the designer's higher-end designs.  The kooky theme and oddball artwork also don't do California any favors.  It's a fizzy lifting drink with low replay intrigue.

Fun little game.  Nothing new, but it has an original theme that might be better at sucking in non-gamers.  It also works pretty well with kids.

Update: Rating ticks up from 7 to 7.5. I have just enjoyed playing it and I prefer it to its sibling, Alhambra. I wish it had a wider variety of "stuff" for one's house. It would be cool if there weren't repeated items. Still, it is pretty funny to have two tanning beds.

Update: I wish this played better with two. I don't get to play this as much as I'd like.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 2
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 2
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1.5

This was a disappointing Schacht game indeed.  Perhaps it's unfair to compare California to some of my other favorite games of his, like Hansa and China, but it just doesn't measure up in terms of interesting decisions.  Your decisions seemed much more obvious in California when deciding what to buy, unlike your moves in either Hansa or China.  I'm happy to cross California off my list of games to ever play again or consider buying.

Some good decision-making, especially around establishing the next round's turn order (a favourite mechanic of mine). The buy high early/buy low later mechanic is also unique.

A very typical Schacht game. On the surface, this game seem relatively simple and not entirely very interesting. But this game offers more strategies than meets the eye. No, it is not as good as his other creations : China/Web of Power or even hansa. In fact, for me, Coloretto is his best creation. Still, I enjoyed this little diversion. The game is best with 3-4 players. Beyond that, the game can lose its flavor and also there is very little you can control. The game starts slow and there does not appear to be much action, but in later stages, the ability to end the game each day at different stages makes for a high screwage probability. 
 I enjoyed a three player version of this game. The game starts off relatively slow but the pace picks up

Easy to teach. Fast, tense play. A little screwage, without direct conflict. Attractive bits. The shopping, decorating theme appeals to folks like mom, Nana, and sister-in-law. I recommend it to people whose family enjoys Ticket to Ride and Alhambra. I like it better than either of these two games because it feels like there is more player interaction in terms of how your decisions can impact your opponents, less down time, less score keeping, faster play.

I liked this game.  It's about renovating a house.  You buy flooring and furniture in the form of tiles and place them in your mansion.  You get bonuses for completing sets of furniture.  In addition as you place furniture you attract guests and guests often bring gifts.  The trick is to get the right tiles before your opponents do.  There's a nice balance between money and tiles.  As you take money you make tiles cheaper for other players.  It played very nicely with 3 players.  I've heard 5 is no fun at all.

RATING: 5
Considering the designer, I actually liked this more than I thought I would, especially the mechanic where taking money reduces its value during the round, which leads to an economy of inflation/deflation. But I would prefer this mechanic be implemented in a game that had more backbone to support it - the rest is relatively uninspired set collection with luck from turn order playing an annoying role in determining who gets advantages.

With shades of Alhambra, California seems like a distant cousin to a much better game.  It has some neat mechanisms that give it a different feel, but it feels fiddly and forced.  It's not a bad game, and offers some strategy, but it's not all that I was hoping it would be.  It plays much more quickly than its predecessor, though.

A fun, light game. I picked it up at the Tanga/Uberplay fire sale because I enjoyed *loretto, and while it does have a different feel to it (enough so that I think there's room for both in larger collections), it scratches the same itch for me and I don't enjoy it quite as much. I also picked it up because it supports 2 (Coloretto does not, at least not very well), but it's not really that great with 2 players either. The biggest issue I have is that the bonus tiles seem to me to be proportionally the easiest way to get points, but this is fairly minor. Traded it away because it wasn't hitting the table often, but in some ways I regret that decision.

Simple to play, yet has a surprising depth of strategy.  The scores are often close enough that the money tie-breaker has to be used.

intresting tile collecting game of capitalisitic aquisition, simple rules and short play time make it a nice filler, solid and well presented bits, in my opinion for what actually comes in the box (including some nice plastic "coins" and a drawstring bag) good value for money

A worthy Euro game I got for cheap on Tanga.  Nothing new here but still a good game that plays in under an hour.

A fast fun gateway game.  The end of game variants for 2 players make it work for 2. Production quality is fine too.

You know, if this would have been published in 1998 instead of 2006, I would have bought it in a minute.  But today, it's just another game.  The decisions are only slightly interesting, and there isn't that much interaction.

light filler with a good theme if you want to play with women that are not much into games.
it is very simple to explain but it has also some very interesting choices, some nastiness you can do from time to time, some space management, some planning, not too much luck. all in all a good game

The California I knew had redwoods, gangs, and sunshine.  And we didn't get prizes for any of it.

Easy to teach and learn.  Easily accessible for non gamers.  The theme is fairly wife friendly.  Fairly interesting strategically.  Plays quickly.  A winner.

There are actually some interesting mechanics at work here, and my daughter rather enjoys the theme of furnishing her house.

If you already own Zooloretto, you do not need this, the theme will probably appeal more to girls than boys but it's a solid family game.

Lite fun... but also not as simple as one might think. It is a fun game for the folks that are not as into the heavier games as I am. Good for those visitors that show up for a weekend that may enjoy a 'game'. A tile laying game with a more mass market appealing theme - home decorating... it succeeds in what it sets out to do - nothing more or less - so it is a solid design for what it is. Bits of top quality - eye candy - and fun.

This manages to toss in some nice Euro decision making/money mangement into a family friendly package (both from a rules and bits perspective).  I really like how taking money makes things cheaper and that taking things from certain places can lead to a round ending more quickly or lasting a bit longer as that provides another way to block other people from getting what they need. Its also nice that the points in the end are a straight forward counting of tiles that makes this a bit more accessible to younger players than other light/medium Euros.

A really simplistic and dull set collection game.  Someone commented that it felt similar to Zooloretto.  Frankly, I'd rather play that than California.  Definitely not for me.

I don't know what to make of California.  Part of me wants to say that there's something off with the game, and the other part wants to say that I really don't know how to play it.  I want to play more and see.

California made almost no impression on me.  "Did I really just finish playing a game?  I'm sitting at a table...there's tiles and boards and whatnot...so either I got whanged on the head or that just wasn't very good."

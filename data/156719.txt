RATING: 6
Simple and good family game. The game offers a good experience, a good level of player interaction and simple but still interesting mechanisms. There's a lot of luck, but the game is fast and therefore the randomness is not too annoying. The components are very nice and strongly appealing for children. 

Overall a game that does what it's supposed to do. It's nothing special for grown-ups, but very good for kids.

RATING: 6.5
Fast and funny kids' game. Luck is the main part, but with 4 players there are many cards to play and the outcome is unpredictable. Lava, with 1/6 chances to come each turn, can play a primary role (giving many penalties) or a totally marginal one: maybe this could be adjusted in some way.
5 cards in hand at start maybe are too much. Better trying with 3 cards.

RATING: 6
Light kid's game, with some "Take that" mechanism by tripping people and stealing cards.  Unfortunately when we played, the lava was only rolled once.  We thought it might be better if the lava was actually cards that were in player's hands and you could play maximum one per turn.

[ESP][Ana] Lo mejor es la soberbia calidad de los componentes, que lo hacen increíblemente atractivo para los peques de la casa. La mecánica es sencilla y fácilmente asimilable. El dado añade aleatoriedad al juego lo que añade una buena dosis de diversión.

Mooi materiaal die dinootjes.

Doel: koppeltjes dino's naar het eind van de race leiden, en liefst met een ei.
Ondertussen ligt een vulkaanuitbarsting op de loer, en duwen de andere dino's je achteruit of omver.

Meteen gekocht voor mijn 6-jarige dochter.
Op de doos staat vanaf 8, maar ik ben overtuigd dat ze dit al kan.

I wanted so much to like this game, but it is incredibly stressful. If the bits were not so adorable, I would probably give it a 5. However, I think the components could be used to make a much better game with some rules tweaks.

I rate this a '5' because there are much worse games for kids out there. But I don't think this game translates well for adults. It is so luck-dependent on the cards you draw and what you throw on the die, and the choices are so obvious, and the point system is so overly biased to the player who crosses the finish like with their second dinosaur first, that there's just not much to like about this game beyond the wonderfully cute dinosaurs that come with it. And the "take that" mechanic is the often used sin incarnate of many kid games.

RATING: 4
I wanted to play this game badly. I saw all those dinos and shiny components. After the first play I thought that buying it wasn a mistake. To be honest our mistake was that we played with adults, not kids :) It can be a cool game for kids, and the fact that we mostly play economic games had an impact on the score.

The game itself is really good.  Both as a game for kids (family) or as a lightweigth for adults.  The movement system is solid, the take-that cards are nice, it's easily explained, moves forward and has enough strategic choices without being overwhelming.

But who made up the point system? I have never seen a more useless point system.  It's more complex than the game itself, and the plastic insert in the box even has no places for the three different kinds of scoretokens (it fits everything else perfectly).  The scoring system works like this: trailing players get negative points, leading players get positive points.  All this is done in really convulated way, with three (or four) different kind of scoring tokens, some of which interact with eachother, and you make (non-meaningfull) choices when you choose which scoring token you take, and the game always end with the player first over the finish line scoring 20 points, and the trailing player scoring -1 points.  I realise there's some kind of farfetched strategy adult gamers could use because of this strange scoring system, slowing the game down to get the egg and such, but you need three or four players (with two players it's just a race and the scoring system means nothing) so it's just too much of a hassle.  Have I made myself clear how much I hate the scoring system? ;)  Besides that: really fun relaxing game.

Also, historical anachronism.  Flowers and blossoming plants didn't exist yet in the time of dinosaurs.

2015 acquisition.

Great children's game and my 5-year-old really likes it.  The components are sturdy and the dinosaurs are great for the children.  There's a fair dose of take-that element in the game so if your children do not enjoy direct confrontation then this may not be for them.

Update August 2017:  the kids absolutely love dishing out those "take that" cards and not upset receiving them.  I'm increasing the rating to an 8.

You need to keep in mind this game was designed for 6 year olds.  The game is simple and pretty straight forward race your dinos off the board to get the most victory points and win.   The game is at its best with 4 players.  It makes for a good family night or just a game between old friends for lots of laughs, because this game has a huge amout of screw your neighbor in it.

Dino Race!!

Seriously though, this is a game in want of a developer to point out some things:

The scoring system is needlessly convoluted for children and needlessly arbitrary for adults. It was presumably designed for four players with little thought given to how it works with two.

The game only ends when someone leaves with the egg, so if the last player remaining has the egg, I suppose they keep playing (this isn't explicit in the rules). It doesn't make sense for anyone without pieces on the board to get the egg, so I also suppose it stops changing hands (this isn't explicit either). But that means the last player is guaranteed to get the egg points, and the only thing that remains to be seen is whether they get any eruption penalties. (When asked about this, the designer didn't give a conclusive answer. Possibly he didn't think rules were really needed for some stuff that might obviously happen in his game.)

The volcano doesn't go nearly fast enough to feel relevant. Eruption frequency is proportional to the number of players, so there will be more volcano rolls with more players, but this is counterbalanced by the increased flow of bonus cards. Someone could get singed early on if they get tail-whapped at the wrong time, but that's about it. It does serve as a soft clock and discourages moving only one dino, but other mechanisms already fill the second function and it seems like a poor use of the dramatic imagery.

The "push back" card should have been called "tailwhap". Dino Race!

Dino Raaace!!!

Almost good. Some nice ideas (movement, part of scoring), but in a same time I see a lot of things to tweak AND the rules leaves many things unclear. Great components anyway. Doesn't offer anything for the adults, but with family this is a quite good choice.

Juego infantil, que no familiar, de 6 a 10 años. Los niños disfrutan más con las quemaduras del rival que corriendo al final.
Sistema de puntuación oculto que no termino de acertar el motivo.
 Como con la mayoria de este tipo de juegos para jugar pocas partidas antes de aburrirse de el.

Very fun game, easy to understand. It can drag a little bit sometimes if no volcanoes are rolled and people keep hitting eachother back, but you'll be done in under an hour no matter what.

Nice looking fun race game that will be much appreciated by younger children. The game takes a bit too long with 4 players since actions are quite repetitive.
Too much luck with points tiles makes this game less interesting than it looks.

The dinosaur models are really quite cute, but much of the joy of the game evaporates after that.  Extremely rules by the card draw, the scoring is so wild as to be almost laughable.  Smacking the guy with the egg seems overly nasty almost.  A pity... It probably can be salvaged with little kids.

Componentes de sonho num jogo chato e muito pobre, que pisca o olho a "Catan", mas que acaba por ser caótico e bastante aleatório, falhando completamente o alvo, uma vez que é bastante complexo para ser um jogo infantil. É uma corrida parva, onde a única coisa boa é a componente vulcão, pois todo o resto é um insulto a quem gosta de jogos de tabuleiro!

RATING: 7
Pretty good kids game, probably most entertaining for those 8 and younger.  My 5 year old enjoys it, though it has taken a few plays for him to get the hang of it.

The more players, the more entertaining it is.  The volcano mechanism doesn't come into play much with only 2 players, which makes for a rather boring game.  There's no incentive to get rid of the egg because you're unlikely to have more than 2 volcano drops before the end of the game.  It's better if you have want to get rid of the egg early on.

In short, the game is at its finest with 4 players.

I wish there were specific rules for each number of players.  For example, if playing with only 2, maybe the volcano automatically erupts after every 6 consecutive non-volcano rolls.  If playing with 3 maybe it automatically erupts after every 9 consecutive non-volcano rolls.  That way there is more incentive to get rid of the egg and taking on lava drops becomes a bigger deal.

Ratings:
2 players - 5
3 players - 6.5
4 players - 8

If playing with 4, this is my favorite children's game out there.

We bought this to play with the kids but ended up playing it with a group of French people at our hotel in Essen. We liked it a lot but it depends what you are looking for. It's a game in the style of Atlantis with cool dino's. 

A light game to start the evening with, play with kids or non-gamers.

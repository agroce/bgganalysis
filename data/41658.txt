Simultaneous action game. Each player has 3 cards in from of them, and each player has some tokens (bullets) that are used to shoot down other players cards, when only one player has cards left the round is scored.
Plays fast and is quite funny and frenetic.

Not sure that this is such a good or replayable game, since there seems to be very limited strategy outside of yelling "bomb reload reload" as early as possible.   After all, if you're dead they're no use to you.   It would normally get a 4 or 5, but the pieces are creative and the theme is relatively funny, so this gets a bonus.

RATING: 5
I enjoyed the game well enough as a quick and light filler.  However, it's going to be one of those games like Ricochet Robots or Ubongo where differences in skill level can really kill things.

Since the game is all about speed in adding some numbers together, someone that can do really fast arithmetic is going to run away with this game unless everyone gangs up to kill him.  Still a fun enough time to spend 10 minutes unless you're absolutely horrible at this sort of thing, in which case I imagine it would just be frustrating.

Fast, fun game in the tradition of Bang! and Cash n Guns. The rules are very simple, the action is fast and furious. Comes with wooden bullets and dynamite for each player. Very thematic, and you can play over and over again - a game plays in under 10 minutes. The only downside is that only 4 players can play - wish it could handle 6 or 8 players.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (March 2014)

I only bought this game because a friend liked it. At first I wasn’t impressed, but after 4 plays, I have come to like this real time speed game. It has very easy rules and the gameplay is very short too, however I feel this game need a special kind of group to be properly enjoyed. Many players can gang up on the leader, but in this case it doesn’t bother me as 1. The game is finished pretty quickly and 2. It is not extremely easy to do so because you only have 2 numbers to begin with, so you will always try to hit someone with those, not just the leader, also the dynamite plays a huge role. To play this, players need to exercise their basic math. Good stuff. 

The art is adequate, but the components are awesome (the bullets and the dynamite). I like the theme.

If players like the game, they will always ask to play again after we finish the first game. I like Adios Amigos much more than Bang! and Ca$h `n Gun$.

I will carry it to our game sessions, it has the potential go to a little further up in my ratings. For now I will keep my copy of the game. Great family game.

It is undisputable that Adios Amigos is an unique game. I enjoy it but I have decided to sell it. The reason is that I have too many games in my game collection so I’m culling the lesser ones to guarantee I play the best ones

It is a shame and it was a hard decision, but I will get rid of Adios Amigos soon.

I might have this rated one point too high, but I like most speed games, and this one is a little different, with cool bullet and dynamite pieces.

There's a lot of luck involved, but usually the faster player should win, and the addition of the reload and bomb actions mixes it up.  I would like to play this more to see how it holds up.

I have two reservations.  First, the bullets roll around and can be unwieldy to pick up and put in the middle of the table when you're trying to move quickly - maybe this is intentional.  Second, I don't see why this only supports four players.  It seems like it could only improve with 5 or 6.  Perhaps there would be a problem with the reload rules, but it doesn't seem like it would be that big of a deal.

[b]Pattern recognition/speed game with addition and subtraction. Neat wooden components (dynamite, bullets). Interestingly, even some of my friends who usually hate speed games don't mind this one much. It's chaos with four players shooting at each other, but that's how it's supposed to be. Luck (resulting from what cards the players have out and what numbers they reveal when) is mitigated by the fact that the game is played over 5 rounds.[/b]

Math-based speed filler game with a pasted on theme. Still, it makes a decent filler for one game (15-20 minutes). Only 2-4 players though.

The game feels better played tan when you read the rules. Still, it's a game you will only want to play once or twice, and then go onto something else.

Also, I thought it will be quite easy to pick on the leader, but up to now, this has not been the case. Everybody is quite busy looking to place his tokens and there's no time for anything else. I guess it might be different with experimented players.

I will really shine at conventions, especially for non gamers.

RATING: 7
Hilarious fast paced game, of flipping tiles and allocating them to cards in other players' tableaus as fast as you can, beating the other players to it. You can allocate a tile to a card if its number is equal to either the difference or the sum of the two numbers on the card. Which sounds arithemeticy and anti-fun, but the theme of shooting at 'em makes it work, because the math is so fast and easy that tiles are flying left right and centre as people shoot for them. And of course there are the frantic calls to re-load (spending a bullet) which allows everyone to flip 2 more tiles and keep it going. And then the dynamite call which gives someone a 10 second pause to kill one thing by himself, while the other players are counting 10 to 1 in an increasingly histrionic manner with hands over their ears to muffle the boom as if a bomb really is going to go off. Anyway, lots of fun with a fun-loving crowd. Oh, you win by killing / claiming more cards than other players over 5 rounds, and a round ends when all players bar one have had their cards claimed. But that doesn't matter so much. It's not a game that will always work, and not one that you'll want to play every week, but can be great fun when pulled out as an occasional filler.

A game that combines [i]math[/i] and [i]simultaneous playing[/i]? I feared the worse since my experience with these kinds of games are usually that the idea is nice but the game doesn't work or then it's no fun at all.
But at last, someone [u]made it work[/u]! Adios Amigos is really, really [b]FUN[/b]. It's fast and furious and the math doesn't [i]feel[/i] like math, it feels more like aiming at the other player's desperados. It gets better if all the players really embrace the theme of the game. I love the panic sensation when a player throws his ammo to the centre of the table and screams [b]"Reload! Reload!"[/b].

And the components are extraordinary too. This could well be a 9:er at some point! And the best thing: it's really, really fast!

Charming fast paced math game.  It is like playing with addition flash cards only you get to shoot them.  The components are awesome.  Where it not for the potentially gruesome theme (which I love) I'd say that this should be in every elementary school.  Still, the art is whimsical enough for this to be good for kids.  The violence is so cartoony that it is all acceptable for the lil' ones.

As for adults, this is a silly fun beer and pretzels game, and throws out all the ridiculous trappings that take that card games have and just cuts to the chase.

About [thing=41658][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=41658][/thing] is a party and family game about math dexterity done with simultaneous actions by the players, in a shootout of additions and subtractions, coupled with reloads to give more shots, dynamites that make everyone else close their ears and countdown from 10 to zero before acting again, and lots of arms flailing.

[thing=41658][/thing] contains few rules and loads of interaction done in real time, with players using tokens to "shoot" the cards of other players, in order to gain points and, hopefully, be the last one standing, which is worth some more points.

All is done very quickly, frantically, with everyone trying to be precise, as there are penalties for mistakes, as well as fast.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Each player reveal three cards, facing the others. All cards have two numbers. Then players reveal, at random, 2 bullet tokens, and these have numbers going from 0 to 9. After this, players use these tokens in order to "shoot" at the cards of other players. For instance, if I revealed my token number 2 and someone has a card with number 3 and 5, I can use my 2 to shoot that card (5-3=2) - a token number 8 could also be used to shoot this card (5+3=8).

At first only two of the ten tokens are revealed, but at any time a person can use a bullet token to make everyone Reload - which means everyone reveal, at random, two more tokens.

Every player also have 1 Dynamite that, when used, makes all the other players to stop the shooting, put their hands above their ears and countdown from 10 to zero before being allowed to return to the normal actions.

When a player have her three cards shots, she is out of the round. When only one player is left the round ends and the person takes one Gold tile, which is worth points (and more points as the rounds go by). Then players check the shots on the cards, to see if the math match. If it does, the person that did the shot takes the card as point. If the math is wrong, the player must pay 3 points to the person she mistakenly shot and also 1 point to everyone else - is a harsh penalty.

Once all the cards are checked and distributed, a new rounds starts. At the end of the fifth round the player with the most points will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Mainly two and both are very simple:
- When to use Reload (to reveal more bullets tokens). This is usually done not only to have more options, but also to throw the other players somewhat off, as they change their attention from one point to another;
- When to use the Dynamite (to stop, for a few moments, the others from playing). This is usually very short lived, as the countdowns are done really fast, but this use can be important to take an important advantage, to finish someone off, for instance.

I could add the use of the bullet tokens as decisions, still they hardly are. Is simple a matter of quickness of perception: you see a card which fits your token, you use the token, regardless of who the person is. Still, I have seen someone focusing his bullets in the player he thought was the closest to him in points, and was successful in doing this. However, this is seldom done - yet the game allows this, so if you are fast and cold-blooded enough, the use of the bullets tokens can be a decision also.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Easy to teach and to play;
- All is said and done in a matter of 15 to 20 minutes;
- Portable and with some nice bits;
- Good amount of interaction.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- There can be some bash the leader, as player can focus their attention on the cards of a given player to eliminate her fast. Yet, most of the time this simply won't happen, and be everyone for themselves. Also, the random reveal of bullet tokens prevents this a little, as you won't shoot if the math doesn't match;
- Player elimination, albeit a very short one;
- The penalty for making a mistake is harsh and likely to take the player out of the contest - but I understand this rule in order to keep players from shooting blindly only to eliminate the others, making necessary to have some caution.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
In the nerdiest shootout ever.

Overall, [thing=41658][/thing] is good for what it is, as the elimination hurts little and stays out of the game for just a short time, and the rules are easy enough for everyone catch on quick, making [thing=41658][/thing] work nicely for both game nights, parties and family time.

Adios Amigos is fast-paced card game runs for five game rounds during each of which each player represents three desperadoes. All players act simultaneously. They need to realize quickly which pistol counter allows them to shoot at which desperado, and then immediately pull the trigger. They can do this if the hit number corresponds to either the sum of or the difference between the desperado numbers on the cards. If you don’t forget to reload and have your bundle of dynamite ready for just the right moment, chances are you may be the last desperado standing and get a loot tile in reward.

The best reaction game for me. Highly thematic and as managed to make such games more interesting. It is not only turn a card, look and grab as fast as possible. Great game and great components too.

Funny game with enjoyable moments, it's ideal to play having a couple of beers and gives a lot of laughs. But I don't like the mathematical "must" of the game, it will be better with something more simple & visually connected.

Juego divertidisimo con muchos momentos de disfrute, es ideal para jugarlo tras tomarse un par de cervezas y proporciona numerosas carcajadas. Pero no me gusta el aspecto matematico obligado del juego, sería mejor con algo más simple y más conectado a lo visual.

Un buen juego de cartas para cuatro jugadores, fácil y rápido. Se trata de sumar o restar, y hacerlo más rápido que los oponentes, para que tus bandidos sobrevivan al tiroteo. Un filler que no puede faltar en cualquier ludoteca.

Rápido y chorra. Agilidad sumando y velocidad. Poco más.

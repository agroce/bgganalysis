[I]tl;dr - Dominion meets area-control, but a themeless result makes for a game that's nice to play, but definitely not exciting, or, for me, a keeper.[/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Trains is Dominion meets Ticket to Ride, and somehow the end result is greater than the sum of its parts. It's a little too fiddly, but the map adds something I didn't know was missing from deck builders. Though I hate the setup and the randomizers (I prefer to fine-tune my own startup deck based on the preferences of the players) the game itself plays quickly and doesn't overstay its welcome. I've played 2 player, 4 player, and 3 player and all three play counts work smoothly. 

I pimped out my copy with some cheap wooden train pieces from Mayday and have printed out a bunch of expansion maps (which I have yet to try). Looking forward to more plays, this may be the deckbuilder which sticks in my collection. 

I wanted to love this one -- I wanted to love it so bad. But without my group behind me, I had no success getting it to the table. Everyone's conclusion was that it was "fun" and "nice" but ultimately other games did the job better. 

Since then, [thing=201808][/thing] has come out, and that more successfully melds deck-building with a central board.

3 plays / 3,4 players

LIKE: Many strategies and card synergies. Having a map is really fun and creates the center of the interaction. The cards are easy to work with, not a lot of text reading. Plays quickly.
DISLIKE: Some reading of the cards, which is a turn off for me, but having similar cards helps. Card draws can get random. Familiar comparisons to Dominion turned me off. There are attack cards, but we didn't play with them.

OVERALL: I was really impressed. The game plays smooth, I enjoyed how players got in the way of each other, but no serious negative effects. Very good for a deck builder, which I normally avoid most deckbuilders.

Basically the same thing as Trains but a real small amount of interaction added in the card variety as well as a very small amount of bonus routes added to give it a ticket to ride feel. I think they started on the right track BUT stopped short of where they should've gone. I hope they take it up a whole level with the next expansion if there is one.

RATING: 4
Not very impressed after my first play.

I got the feeling that everyone ends up buying the same cards, doing the same things, building a similar rail network, and ending up with almost the same score.

I won our first match with a score of 45 while my adversaries scored 44 points each. And I don't know what I did that was better/smarter than what they did. It could have gone either way.

I have to try it some more, but it didn't give me the feeling that this is a real rail game in which you have to try to outsmart your opponents in trying to build a better rail network/economic engine, like in a typical game 18xx, Railroad Tycoon and even Ticket to Ride.

It might be early to say, buy it felt like a poorly implemented theme around a typical, Dominion-style, deck building game.

It really lacks more interaction.

EDIT AFTER SECOND PLAY: For trade.

Nagyon-nagyon magasan veri a Dominiont. Tök hasonló élmény volt, mint anno az alap Trains.

Ebben ami új volt az a távoli összekötések, amikért járt egy 4-5-6 pontos kártya. A 2 személyes táblaoldal is jó.

A dominion clone with a map and a train theme. Works well. The innovative elements are the Waste cards you have to take with each action on the map and the fact that the map actions limit your deck building capabilities and offer dual focus strategies. They both work well, but it does not take deck building one step further, like ascension does. I do not prefer the attack cards.

Awesome fun! I think this is better than the base game. The cards seem to be more strategic, but no less complicated. The 2 player board was a blast and the route cards give you a focus to base your building on. 2 player game, me and Sander. Sander puled it out 58-51 by getting the 3rd station on the 1 city on the board that could hold 3. Great stuff, keeper!

I really enjoyed this game.   What I liked most about this is that the board/trains really intuits a lot of complexity without needing to explain so much.  As a result the cards can make quite a bit of difference without having to have so many rules and rule exceptions.

This really helps, as a beginner, where you can see how things work together, what would be a useful play and what wouldn’t be a useful play without having to have played the game times before.

10x10 2015.  I've never played the original Trains and I played this primarily 2 player.  The economy is almost exactly the same as Dominion with copper/silver/gold in train form.  The area control board game that is attached is very simple.  I recommend playing with the route bonuses too as I feel the extra bit it adds is nice.  Only two of the games I played were close- and those were the last two and were easily the most fun.  A lot depends on the map and how you stake out your area early on.  In the games that weren't close it was clear about half way through who would win.  A lot also depends on if someone wants to end the game quickly- laying rails repeatedly, which seems like it can be a good strategy.  I feel like, compared to Dominion, the cards are less interesting or at least are very situational depending on your board position, strategy, and map.  Of course part of the boring cards problem could be that there is so much less variety compared to Dominion with all the expansions.  I like the game, but I think it needs more variety which means more investment, and even then this probably isn't a Dominion killer, for me.

I like this one a lot. I've wanted a Dominion like game in my collection but I've been hesitant to invest in Dominion in particular. I'd have probably bought it by now if my wife had any interest. 

When I learned about Trains, it seemed like a perfect blend of the Dominion card drafting mechanic and the beloved train theme. I like the inclusion of a map and how that draws players together for more interaction. I still haven't played enough to really get a feel for all of the different cards.

From my plays so far, the board has been slightly disappointing. I want so much for this game to be just a bit more than it is, but I can't put my finger on what it needs more of. Ultimately, I look forward to playing more. I think it has immense potential.

For two players, this game is much better than the original. Each board is half the size of the original one. Also, the victory point cards all are different from those in the original, and the cheapest is 4 dollars. Consequently, the interaction on the board is more interesting, and there's more of it. In fact, in many games the board produces all the scoring; none comes from the cards.

I like deck-building. I like area control. But I don't really like them together in Trains. While unique to try and add a little more spice in point gathering (essentially a game within the game of collecting points), it just doesn't hit the theme enough for me to get very invested. It feels more like an annoying side game. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy more complex games with lots of parts to them, but neither of the parts in Trains are that interesting. I rather play Dominion for the deck building aspect and another game for area control.

Adds attack-type cards, bonuses for completing routes, special two-player maps, and a slew of new cards. 

It's a full game, which may turn off those who just want to buy more cards for the original Trains. But that was fine with me. 

A half-point deduction compared to the first Trains for some vague wordings in the rulebook regarding combining the sets (like what to do with the multiple victory point cards). This felt sloppy to me, and one of the things I liked about the first Trains was how slick and tight it felt.

Very nice expansion to Trains, but I wish it wasn't a $60 stand-alone base game.   The two-player maps are a nice addition, as are the route cards.   The rest of the game is the same, but with new cards of course.  That's the main reason to get this.

2017-04-17: I like this game but I'm afraid it will 'always' drag out to be a longer game than Dominion. It is quite prone to yielding low income and thus making the game go a bit too long. Also there are no ways to trash your lowly 1-income trains which is really slowing things down. I like the trash all waste' action though! And no limit on Buys is the best decision ever!
The board adds a bit but building stations is irritating when someone just swoops in and get the same points as you.
Would very much like to have a larger map/card-base to draw from. Will get original Trains, but Destination Fun? Sigh. .

A bit disappointed by this. The deckbuilding is fine, but the board play is little more than a complex victory display. There is route-building, but there is no feeling of an expanding network; no sense of connecting industry with raw materials; no pick-up and deliver. The game's entire arc is in the development of your deck, which seems a missed opportunity. Not a bad game but likely not good enough to bump Dominion out of the rotation.

Highly recommend. Compared to the original Trains this is more of the same with the addition of route cards and a little bit of more interaction cards. Most notable improvement are the route cards that improve the feeling of building railways. The two-player specific boards are great. Adds some "take that" mechanics without being overly aggressive.

A great addition to an already excellent game, with creative new cards, new maps (two for 2 players!) and the route mechanic, which is also compatible with the original game.

Played Oct 2014

I'm not a fan of Dominion style deck building games and this was no exception. The board element was neat and the onslaught of waste cards was interesting to deal with. I would happily play this a couple more times to get a sense of the cards I didn't play with, but even then I'm in no rush. I just didn't find the decisions in the game very engaging.

RATING: 8.5
They did a really good job listening and fixing the player problems with the first game.
This game adds a bunch to the first one.
The new maps are real good (especially the 2-player ones).
The attack cards are not that strong in my opinion, and are usually not worth the buy, but this game is a must have for Trains lovers. And I would suggest this one over the original if you are just starting up.

It is as good as the original Trains is - the new things here won't bring anything totally new here. Not even "tickets" aren't that game changer actually. But yes, you get more cards, more maps etc. so some more variety for different plays. And Trains is still very good game! But if you ask from me, I would say it's enough to own one of these games - not both of them - if you don't play it A LOT.

RATING: 9
The game is lighter than I thought: Tash-Kalar is decidedly longer, but much more satisfying, for me. Puzzle Strike is also heavier, with more complex effects and combos.

The upside is that the effects are very legible, very clear (use of symbols, large font). They make thematic sense, as well.

Now, I do like it: it's fast, and I want to get better at it.

It's also fast, with a slightly long setup time (5 minutes maybe, so longer than many of my games).

I expect it to be nicer with more people: in the two player game, occupying the same cities as the opponent can be a no-brainer, since otherwise they can get points for stations, there.

With this expansion only, it is not possible to trash/discard cards, except Waste cards: this limits how much the deck can evolve.

It's also nice to have another "route" game (in a similar category, I have Power Grid. Maybe Quartermaster General would qualify too?).

I really like how the strategy shifts during a single game depending on what my opponent plays and how the board situation develops.

I really like the pace of the game (despite the shuffling: it is a bit challenging to keep thinking while shuffling).

I like how I don't have to make so much effort to memorize the points grabbed my opponent, unlike in Dominion.

Using the route cards is not my favorite way to play: they restrict the possible board strategies rather than enhancing them, I find (at least with 2 players). The goals in Race for the Galaxy, by contrast, are a bit hard to reach, and your cards might not allow you to reach them: you have to compromise, to let some go, etc., where the goals in Trains: Rising Sun are easier to get, with a strategy which is obvious (where the goals in Race interact more with your overarching strategy).

RATING: 8
Without the 5 and 8 cost victory point cards, the new route bonuses, higher point value remote locations, no Tourist Train, and more cards to get rid of waste this standalone expansion definitely has a lot more involvement on the board, and at least for most games I think there is no fear that 90% card strategies dominate. I especially like the route bonuses because it feels like you're actually building a track rather than just a blob of rail tokens. 

Most of the cards seem more unique than in the original, instead of e.g. 4 different cards to ignore costs in different types of terrain. There are still some that from a glance seem pretty weak, but in general I think the cards are more balanced. One problem is though some cards appear to erratas to originals (Upgrade is a strictly worse Garage, while Charity Support is a drastically weakened Tourist Train), and so mixing the sets together may be a bit awkward.

Overall I think it's better than base game Dominion and maybe even Dominion with 1 or 2 expansions, but it can't compete with 9. I'll need more plays to see if it replaces Thunderstone with one expansion as my #2 deckbuilder.

Plays are tracked via my Trains entry.

Game Quality: A significant improvement in the system, and the one I would recommend to start with despite meaning you miss out on some really good cards from the original game. More later. Let's go with a 8 so far, but I can see this moving up.

Would I buy this again if I was starting over: Yes. Would it be one of the first initial group I buy? I'm leaning with a yes. 9.

Do I want to play this if asked: I want to pause on saying I would play it every time I got a chance to game, but I could see playing this until people who I play with got sick of it. 8.

Overall: 8.98.

Rating Potential: 8.98, but I'm not against it going higher. I haven't been this fascinated by a game since Suburbia.

Since my wife and I play a lot of 2-player games, we bought this stand-alone expansion for Trains. We don't own and never played the original Trains, so our comments are based on this version only. This one really worked for us as a 2-player game! The deck building combined with the rail laying on the board, the waste in your deck... it all nicely fits. There are 2 2-player only maps included in the game and one is really tense with the starting player spots. We didn't like Dominion but this one is really a perfect fit for us!

As a stand-alone game, Rising Sun is not great; the big new features of this game are the attack cards, about which I remain skeptical. Some of the new trains are just plain odd, not adding anything so much as simply trying to get by based on their novelty. But the game does add several new ways to manage waste, something which was under-addressed in the original game, and it also includes two two-player maps, which are a wonderful addition. As a standalone game, Trains is probably an 8. Trains: Rising Sun is a 6.5. But if you take the best parts of both games, with some careful pruning, there is a solid 8.5 or 9 in there.

This is the deck builder to beat at the moment. A timed Dominion-like gameplay with a bit more player interaction via a game board. This game does so well in creating a sense of urgency among players as the game could end with 1 of 3 possible triggers. The waste mechanic is brilliant as it requires the player to weigh skipping a turn to return waste or to push on with hopes that your deck would still run just fine. Highly recommended.

I had sold Dominion because I felt I had got what I needed out of it and didn't really have a desire to play it anymore. I saw this game was almost identical to Dominion but added in the route building aspect. This interested me because I liked Dominion but wanted something else on top. Trains was good but I still felt like I was just playing Dominion with some route building added on. I have other route building games that I like more and I wasn't looking to replace Dominion with Dominion so I sold it after 1 play. As the rating shows, I would play this again if someone had it and wanted to play, but I wouldn't request it myself.

Edit: I guess I played it twice, hehe.

RATING: 5
On paper, the combination of the amazing Japanese rail system and deck-building could do no wrong for me. But Trains: RS proves that a fantastic concept can sometimes translate into a mediocre game experience. 

For starters, the deck-building system lacks the conventional elements which make the genre appealing to me. The individual cards are short on character, there are no quirky combos to assemble, nor does the variable set-up nudge you into different paths to victory. I'll grant that handling the voluminous amounts of waste is a [i]different[/i] challenge, but it also goes against my better judgement of keeping my deck trim and efficient.

The crucial decisions lie mostly in how players position themselves on the board, but that also happens to be a generic rail system. Sometimes you'll get to play cards which are marginally more effective, and sometimes you won't. To sum, Trains: RS works exactly like how you'd expect a deck-building train game to work, but it doesn't really offer anything exciting beyond that.

A Trains alapjátékhoz képest új térképet kapunk, ami kétoldalas, egyik 3-4 játékos számára, a másik 2 darab 2 játékos térképet tartalmaz. Ez már kellemes változatosságot ad. Új kártyákat kapunk és útvonalkártyák jönnek még be újdonságként. Adott két hexát összekötve bónuszpontokat kapunk, illetve egy egyszer végrehajtható akciót. A kártyák szépek, a játék számomra jóval érdekesebb a Dominionnál, a téma közelebb áll hozzám. Ami egyedül kevésbé tetszik benne számomra, hogy csak a szemét kártyákat lehet alapvetően eltávolítani, azaz nagyon kis paklira nem lehet lemenni, ez persze tematikus valahol, hisz nem dobál ki az ember vonatokat csak úgy, de valahogy ez hiányzott, de gondolom kiegészítőkben bőven lesz ezt szabályozó kártya. Mindenesetre egy ponttal többet adtam rá, mint az alap Trainsre, jó játékélmény volt.

This is a deck-building game, but fortunately it's not just deck-building -- I don't really love those games very much! The board adds a much needed spatial element to the game, with players fighting to reach certain areas, manage borders (sort of), etc. I also like the tweaks here (vs. Dominion):
- buy as much as you want
- use all your card actions
- built in way to "Chapel" your deck, at least for those Waste cards, without turning this into a deck-thinning game instead of a deck-building one

This was a lot of fun, and I even managed to (barely?) win!

WOW!  Unbelievable improvement on the base game for 2 players.  The 2p boards are now extremely tight and tense, and the other tweaks to the starting set up show that they really put effort into designing and playtesting the 2 player experience -- and what a great experience it is!  Building on the board and laying rails is now crucial to victory, which turns deckbuilding into a full board game experience -- not just a neat mechanic.  Huge replayability, as well.  This one is absolutely a keeper and renders Dominion superfluous in our collection.

Terrific expansion, and worth getting even if you don't own the base game. Fixes a lot of the perceived issues in the base game with a lot of the new action cards (expanding on the board is much more important in this expansion). The two-player specific boards also completely change the feel of 2P games. Highly recommend.

Instead of taking a great train game and using card drafting as an engine to drive it, Trains takes an okay drafting game and bolts a remedial train game onto it.  The result is that the train game sucks energy out of the drafting game and both flop.

This is one of the rare deck builders I've enjoyed playing. I remember the first time I played Dominion and ended up playing it multiple times back to back.  And then it just became meh.  All the Dominion clones or games that borrowed from Dominion left me bored - even when I won!  Rising Sun reminded me of the first time playing Dominion.  I want to play it again! I've realized that maybe I just need something in addition to the deck building to make it work.  So far this does and I would rather play this over Dominion.

Considered an expansion for Trains, one of my favourite games. Kept the box to fit all cards from Trains, Rising Sun and Coastal Tides. All maps and spare pieces are in Coastal Tides' slimmer box. Trains box was damaged and tossed away.


Only first play logged, then included in Trains.

Provisional rating, one play stand-alone.  On the basis of cards seen so far, no reason to prefer over Dominion Intrigue (say).  The spatial element doesn't increase my interest.

This simply works. Fast pace and meaningful decisions. Compared to the original Trains this is more of the same with the addition of route cards and a little bit of more interaction cards. Most notable improvement are the route cards that improve the feeling of building railways.

Love that there are 2 two player maps that come with the standalone expansion. Seems like the designers really listened to what people wanted. Also love the endless replayability with the randomizers, not to mention if you have the original game, no two sessions should ever be the same if you shuffle well. Good deck builder that feels like it has a purpose (element of area control/map interaction/bonus route completion). The bonus routes are a nice addition. Plays very quickly, even on first play, and is a low investment to learn and teach.

Do enjoy the game with 3 or 4 on the bigger maps for a longer, more involved experience. Scales well though.

Edit: may have to remember to include at least 1 waste management randomizer in each game because waste hampers building your deck. Especially painful for new players when introducing them to the game.

Not much to say here, if you've played Dominion you already know 80% of how to play Trains. The most obvious addition is the board. One of the possible actions on some of the cards allows you to lay rails, which you track on the map. This opens up a few new ways to score points, besides just collecting VP cards, as you do in Dominion.

In my very limited experience, it seems like the track laying isn't necessarily a victory condition. It's more like a cold war mechanic. You don't necessarily need to dominate the map, but rather just keep up with what your opponent is doing. If someone ignores the map completely, they will lose, but it isn't likely they will win if they focus there.

The waste mechanic is interesting as well, acting as a governor to slow down an engine of runaway combos. It's not just an arbitrary buzzkill though, as it actually adds a fair amount of push your luck excitement to the mix, as you try to outrace the pollution clogging up your operation.

The long and the short of it is that if you love Dominion, you probably don't need this. If however you thought Dominion was a neat idea trapped in a one-dimensional game, then Trains might be just the thing you are looking for.

It"s a very fun deck-building game. Scoring from building rails on the board makes the game feeling like playing a board game not a card game. My kids love it a lot.

A very similar deck building experience to Dominion except that now there is a board/area control element to shake things up a bit. I absolutely love the waste concept, as it generally prevents any true golden decks and the board element adds a whole new level of strategy.

I find the theme to be slightly more approachable than dominion but at the same time I'm not sure if I actually like it better or not. This is partially due to the setup time, and partially due to the increased length of the game, even for just 2 players. Plus the route goals that come with this expansion are definitely a must have over the original train!

I think that for someone who really liked dominion but wished for a bit more it's perfect, I'm just not sure if I actually needed more.

(Was purchased with Trains base game, so the review is for the combined set)

-- Sold: 7/2/16 - This was such a hard call, I really really enjoy this game and have no issues with it. But it just wasn't seeing any playtime. I could definitely see picking this and rising sun up again one day.

This is one hell of a fun deckbuilder. I prefer it to Dominion, Thunderstone, and even map-based ones like A Few Acres of Snow, and Mythotopia.

The maps add so much to the game, and I've never before thought that deckbuilders work particularly well with only two players, but here you simply use a 2-player map, and the game is just as fun as with more players.

The new VP cards are a definite improvement, fixing a problem with the original game. However, I still didn't feel like there were enough different effective strategies, and there's a certain blandness to the presentation that dulls excitement.

RATING: 8.5
I have the "Superstar" version with the individual player cards. Heck of an enjoyable game. Quick playing with somewhat accurate results. Too bad this series was not continued.**

**Purchased a home brew All-Time All-Star set of 800+ player cards (plus a CD containing 2100+ more players). This expands the game in a great way and they're well done cards that include the dice numbers on them so you don't have to do that silly line matching of the cards on the game board.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Fun, quick game to play.  Results are easily attainable and there are some good home brewed rules and sets so you don't have to pay a lot (or anything) to get the game.  I prefer a more detailed sim so it's not ever going to be at the top of my list but it's still enjoyable and easy.

Certainly not the most realistic game on the market, but it was realistic enough.  The fielding mechanism was over-simplified, which was one of the biggest drawbacks. However, it was fairly inexpensive, the rules were easy to learn, it played really fast, and it didn't take long to set up. I could literally fill out the lineups and play a game in 20 minutes if it was a pitcher's duel. I have worn out the all-time all-star team charts, I have played them so much. Definitely my most played game ever, and still one of my favorites, in spite of some obvious drawbacks in realism.

I own the 1971 version in a long box. I got this in a trade with a buddy many, many years ago. Fun and fast moving, but it didn't really seem to capture the interplay between batter and pitcher as did Statis-Pro Baseball - the SI game is more lightweight and just fast, fun, dice rolling.

We had a group of about 4-6 people in which each summer during high school and college, we had drafts and managed 20 game seasons.  We loved this game. We were able to determine the odds on rolling each number and correlate that with the player cards to see how the cards actually matched the players lifetime batting average and to determine what type of hit each player would be most likely to roll.  This added strategy to the draft.  Fun game!

I owned the Superstar Baseball version of this game.  It never did it for me at all.  First of all, player cards based on careers are hokey.  Are they doing it based on the whole career, his career peak, or what?  I have no idea.  And then, how are they standardizing between eras?  Again, no idea, and even if I had an idea, no one would be able to agree on how to do so.

Gameplay is fairly standard.  Not as smooth or as in-depth as Replay, though.  But the two-roll system is innovative, if cumbersome.

People like the fact that the results are right on the card, instead of having to check a chart.  But that doesn't make sense either.  The card says something like "G*".  What the heck does that mean?  I guess I have to go look at a chart to find out.  "But," they'll say, "you will soon memorize what G* means."  Oh, just like I will soon memorize what a 1 means in Col. 1 in Replay?  It's the same thing.

I have the brown box version with the Babe Ruth cover.  The intrigue of the various matchups makes this game very interesting to me.  I also bought the 1978 expansion set and copies of [i]All-Star Replay[/i] that had additional cards in them including Joe DiMaggio, Hack Wilson, Jimmie Collins, and Herb Pennock.  Excellent game for solitaire play, too.

Having played this the same night as Strat-O-Matic baseball, it's hard to not compare the two.  I guess this one seems a little simpler (at least when playing by the basic rules), with fewer statistics involved.  But it's fun to put all the baseball greats on a team together and see what happens.  I think I feel the same way about this game as I do with Strat-O-Matic.  I wouldn't choose it myself, since I'm not the biggest baseball fan, but when played with people that are, it's fun.

Just one solitaire game so far.  I have the AH "Ruth" edition.  I can see the allure.  There are some mechanical aspects to this game which make it a little fiddly.  But I did like it enough to revisit it.  Not sure I'll make it through a full season, and I would want different cards so I could play my dream team against a variety of opposing teams.

But more likely is I will play around with this on slow afternoons and be content with the mix found in the box.

Sports simulations are not my favorite type of game and this is not even my favorite baseball simulation (memories of years of Strat-o-Matic has forever enshrined that classic as the ulitmate in that category).  That said, this plays quickly and offers a good deal of baseball flavor with just the right degree of chart lookups so that the game has some depth without becoming a chore.

RATING: 9
Sports Illustrated All-Time All-Star Baseball is the best of all the Sports Illustrated games and the best baseball sim ever.  A classic.  Superstar Baseball, which features card versions of 96 of the ATAS players, is fun but seems flimsy.  (Charts are better than cards any day!)  There were 3 sets of charts for individual seasons (1970, 1971, 1972), each with a different format.  If you like this game, you owe it to yourself to check out the many sets of homemade charts that have been put together by various individuals over the past few years.

Randy Cox has done a lot of good things with this game, but it still only cracks my top 5 -- the changes made by Randy greatly improve the game, adding detail and realism, but it's still not in the caliber of Strat-O-Matic, Dynasty, APBA or Replay (IMO).

This is a great game and often overlooked in discussions about baseball board games. It doesn't have the season replay value of APBA or Strat-O-Matic, but it has a really enjoyable and unique system for playing baseball. I especially like the lefty-righty pitcher-batter system, as it allows for lots of strategy and contemplation.

There was another SI game with the Hall of Fame All-Stars.  It had pitching and player cards and dice (roll 10-39)  My brother still has it.

Haven't found it yet but would like to buy for my old time baseball game buddy.

This rating is for "Superstar Baseball," son of Sports Illustrated All-Time, All-Star Baseball, which many baseball boardgamers swear is the best simulation ever. As such "Superstar" is generally considered much less of a game than ATAS. This circumstance is complicated by the fact that "Superstar Baseball" only came with 96 players, and, later, a bonus release of some stars from the '70s. However, through the miracle of the Internet, and via a usergroup for the game, one can download individual all-time-great player cards and play leagues, etc. I have the 1978 version of the game, and although I've always liked it I've never gotten into an actual replay. So I rank it a 7. I can play a game over my lunch break and feel like I'm really simulating baseball without having to re-roll dice and check endless charts. One can make strategy decisions such as stealing, hit-and-run, bunting, and whether to try for an extra base. Wild pitches, passed balls, hit batsmen, and other such plays also occur. The game board contains a field and all charts, so rolling dice and looking up results is quick and easy. Especially attractive are the batter cards that provided hitting breakdowns vs. left- or right-handed pitchers, and part of the fun is placing the pitcher in the left- or right-hander box as well as each given batter. In sum, this game plays fast, feels like baseball, and simulates actual player performances. Other games may provide more detail, but for me this one provides a good balance of complexity and playability.

Yes, I'll play this game any time despite it's roster deficiency and lack of strategy (such as infield back or in). But it's so easy to play, has beautiful charts (1970 version), and reminds me of my childhood when I had a lot of time to play games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I've always considered this to be the very best of all the baseball simulations.  It's much more streamlined than APBA, Strat-o-Matic, or Replay and miles simpler than Dynasty.  Plays quickly with accurate stats and is a blast for the older crowd (ie, those who actually remember when Pete Rose or Jim Hegan played). :)

Superstar Baseball (pictured of this page of BGG) is NOT the same game as Sports Illustrated Baseball, which contained the 1970 season charts.  SI later published the '71 charts, which added 5 extra players to each team.  Then they made the Alltime Allstar team charts, filled with charts for 800 (mostly) hall of fame caliber players.  Superstar Baseball (Avalon Hill) changed the charts to cards and whittled the 800 players down to about 100, I think.
So, my ratings are:  1970 SI Baseball  9.5
                     1971 SI Baseball 10.0
                AH Superstar Baseball  8.1

Blecch.  Superstar Baseball version with individual HoF player cards.  

Pro: pitchers have influence and not in a 50-50 way; managers have control of steals and runner advancement (in some situations)can elect to steal of have runners advance; all results are either on player cards or right on the playing board; lefty-righty matters

Con: having to align batting and pitching cards just so on playing board grids; no individual fielding plays (generic "fly out" or "ground out", e.g.); two cards needed for each pitcher (for separate batting and pitching tables); clunky fielding results (like double play with bases empty); typos on cards; 

This has some things going for it, but the lack of individualized fielding results made it impossible for me to get the feel that I was simulating a baseball game with real players.

9 for nostalgia.  My brother and I played this game more than all others combined--times fifty.  We drafted, kept teams together (and traded) for a full 162 season, broken up into 18-game miniseasons.  All stats kept on yellow legal pads by my brother, who is now an actuary.  I think I can still tell you the HR rolls of every card...  I would love to play this again.

Baseball simulation game using statistical charts and specialized dice, released by Sports Illustrated during the early 1970s. Inherited my copy from my father. Played extensively in solo during my teenage years as well as a few head-to-head matches with my father. I even used to record stats for the players in my all-time all-star league (and learned some pretty good math skills along the way!). Haven't played in well over 10 years however.

Owned the brown box version (Babe Ruth cover) as a kid.  This game is the only reason why I still recognize the names of ancient hall-of-famers.

Played endlessly in a way that showcased my obsessive tendendies.  We kept full stats on every game (recorded every play, etc.) and every player.  Somehow [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_Nichols]Kid Nichols[/url] - a big-time player from 1890 to 1906 - was the hottest pitcher in the league, even though his "yellow card" stats were terrible.*

Man, did I truly love this game.  Not something you play as an adult, though.  That's what video games are for - to prevent sports fans from rolling dice 500 times for the win.

*Nichols played for the Boston Beaneaters, apparently - a team I'd never heard of before typing up this comment.

GAME: Biblios Dice
RANK: 2597
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
1st play: This very much captured the tension and difficult decisions in original Biblios.  The market phases emulate the "spend or hold" feeling of the 2nd half of original Biblios, and I liked it.  Very well done dice port - on par with Roll For the Galaxy in the sense that it captures the feel of the original game very well, but with dice.

2nd play: Although I liked it and it felt like a good implementation, Biblios Dice is really expensive for what it is, and at that cost, I'd rather play the regular game.

Given that neither Biblios Dice or Biblios have any sort of theme, the two games don't feel similar in the least; the only thing they really share is a name. Really light but fun little dice filler game that is very enjoyable to play.

Interesting game, and fun, however it does drag on a little long. I love the dice drafting, however I dislike the interim dice pool auction that happens a few times per game. I think its not needed and makes the game go on too long. After 10+ plays, its lost its luster.  I would play it if requested once in awhile.

5 players is too many. You only get 1 crack at selecting and you're just getting scraps as you move further down the line. With 3, and maybe 4, I could see some much needed tension developing between the 'drafting' rounds. But with a reduced dice pool for fewer players, maybe not. I also think 5 is too many for the auction. It makes breaking up the 2 piles a less strategic affair b/c you can't analyze everyone's position well enough to make the decision. There is also an issue with sequence of scoring I need to figure out - can you go below 0?

While not as good as its predecessor, Biblios Dice is still a lot of fun. It has several advantages over the card game in that it can play up to 5 players and it has a better 2-player setup (using a 3rd bot player). A disadvantage is that it takes longer to setup and takes twice as long to play. If you're looking for a short filler game for 3-4 players, stick with Biblios. But if you want to try a dice game with some fun bidding mechanisms, give Biblios Dice a roll.

Great game.  Some have said it is a little fiddily with the chip set up and it is but that is not unlike the card game.

Why I got rid of it : Yes I know there are no chits in the card game but laying the cards out and then picking them and then auctioning them and repeating is a lot of hand work and not much thinking is needed in between making it a little fiddly.

I heard this described as a heavier version of Biblios, and was very excited. However, I ultimately prefer the greater simplicity of the original game. Biblios Dice feels less than the sum of its parts - lot's of little bits to set up and move around and not quite enough interesting decisions. Mind you, it's still a good game, just not as good as the original for my purposes.

This has a bit of Biblios in it, but it's nothing like it. Without the market phase, I think the game will turn out to be very bland. 

It was okay, I enjoyed my first play but if I could only choose one game, I'd pick Biblios in a heartbeat.

Price point is a lil steep for a dice game.

Dr Finn should be commended for listening to feedback and improving this version in every respect, thus making an already very good game into a great one. The original Biblios is still one of my all-time favorites and although I enjoyed the  original dice game it was never going to reach those heights, until now that is but  now. This really is how a dice version should be imagined, it plays differently enough to the original, but shares a common aim and  reinterprets the core mechanics in a fresh innovative way. Biblios really has got the dice version that it deserves.

Quick playing dice activation game. Roll some dice, take turns doing actions, bid. There is sort of a race element to it as you want to climb the scoring tracks faster than everyone else. The game ends really quickly, and for the decisions involved that's a good thing! It's a light, filler game, but I prefer regular Biblios.

* Kickstarted! *

NOT Biblios just re-worked to dice, the only thing similar are the categories and dice for point tracking. Instead of card drafting, one player rolls all of the dice and then players, one-by-one, pick sets based on the results that can improve their standings in the materials, get them gold or shift the score. Instead of bidding card by card in an auction phase at the end, there's a regular phase in which you bid on 6 or 3 of the dice. And instead of just playing to the end of the deck and seeing who's got the most of another colour, you play until people reach the top and then award more victory points on top of those accumulated on the way. The attention to what others are doing is essential, it's intense, and it's a lot of fun.

BIG PLUS: easy to learn, interactive, well designed
MINUS: starts to feel long at the end, power die not included beyond first 50 kickstarter backers

Biblios Dice is a great new take on Biblios.  While I don't personally like the dice game as much as I do the original, it's still a fun game and it's different enough so that I can play one without tiring of the other.  I really like how the tracks work and how it's sort of a point salad with end scoring.  Simplistic with a lot of moving parts and a great game.

07-28-2015 - I'm probably rating this a 6 while comparing it to regular Biblios.  Biblios is such a great game, and this game, while capturing a lot of the feel and translating the experience to a dice game reasonably well, just isn't the same.  The biggest missing element for me is the agony you feel sometimes when deciding what cards to hold onto and which to let go in Biblios.  You don't have that in Dice.  Everyone sees everything that'll be available once the dice are rolled.  Perhaps using a point to re-roll the dice could add an element of stressful unknown, but it's just not the same.  Still a decent game though, I'm sure it'll get some more plays.

It's sad that the most fun part of this game is when it's your turn to be start player and you get to roll the dice. I love the original Biblios, but this game just doesn't compare well. No reason to play this if you already have Biblios, unless you REALLY like rolling dice.

Adapted from one of my favorite games, Biblios Dice succeeds in keeping the thrill of the original game while adding some new elements. The conceptual flow of the game remains the same: the first player rolls the dice, then everyone selects one type of resource from the pool. But instead of two phases of the game (drafting then auctioning), there is a market phase where the first player divides the dice pool into uneven groups of dice and then all players auction for the chance to take their group of dice. I thought it was an interesting version of an already great game. I love Biblios and I love Biblios Dice. I refuse to live in a world where I'm forced to choose between them. Excellent game.

Biblios Dice is both the same and different from the original Biblios. There's definite similarities but the mechanics as a whole are quite different. Hard to classify, kind of like a light euro with dice chucking. Plays pretty quickly (AP prone people might lengthen the game some though).
First, the negatives: Setup is probably the weakest point, taking quite a bit for such a quick game, and the game can be a bit fiddly with bits. Theme is pretty weak but not entirely absent. The only other point of concern for some people may be the chance element. An unusually good dice roll could give one player a strategic advantage. Usually this is mitigated over the whole of rolls, but as game scores do finish relatively close, such an event could make a difference in final ranking. That said, most games will benefit from the nature of statistical average and come down to strategy.
Now the pros: There's actually a lot more hidden strategy here than first meets the eye (warning to AP prone players). Some really interesting decisions come up every turn, and I really like that. Of course the dice chucking is fun too. The market phase is a bit unusual but seems to work. And of course, for its game length this is a pretty solid experience.
There's a two player variant which uses an AI system; it works pretty well but the game is much better still IMO with at least three players.

Honestly, the game feels nothing like the original Biblios. This should be rated as its own game, and based on its own merits this is a very solid dice drafting game. Mostly tactical decisions, but still interesting. A lot commenters seemt to think the auction is the best part, but I actually think that's the one part of the game that falls flat, since opportunities to get gold are so few, it is usually pretty easy to predict who will win an auction just by paying a little attention.

Didn't feel like there were enough interesting decisions for how long the game goes. Maybe if there were less tracks where players had to compete more intensely for? I dunno... The Auction turns came way too fast and kinda broke the flow of the game. Ran a lot longer than I hoped it would.

Played once with 3P. Biblios Dice retains the core elements from the original Biblios, but re-engineers several other parts by incorporating a dice-drafting mechanism into the equation. The majority contest now takes place openly on various tracks. Auctions are no longer a separate phase of their own, but are triggered intermittently instead. A brand new racing element is also added to diversify the VP sources as well. 

Biblios Dice is a solid reimagination of its parent, although it doesn't quite reach the same standards. Personally, I favor the minimal and streamlined approach of the original. It also lacks the level of angst which is present in the original Biblios' card-drawing mechanism.

It has the flavor of Biblios, but the chaos of the dice ends up really taking away from the clean strategy of the original.

Too much randomness for my taste.  The game, for the most part, came down to having a good roll on your own turn and being lucky with picking up a good roll from the person ahead of you in turn order on occasion as well.  All night long, I basically rolled rainbows, meaning I could rarely ever pick up more than 1-2 dice on my turn.  The others I was playing with often ended up being able to pick up several dice at a time, with the next player getting to pick up a couple dice as well, and then back to me at again, a choice to pick up a single die.

I enjoy Biblios much more than this game.  Biblios Dice is a definite pass for me, and I haven't any desire to play it again.

Biblios dice is a game that is not quite up to snuff with it's predecessor. The delicious decisions that were associated with the main mechanic in Biblios are merely an echo here.

If you are not comparing it to the aforementioned, I suppose the game has some merit, but it looks like such a mess on the table and lacks a bit of elegance in both game and graphic design.

If I were to recommend a dice roller by this designer, it would be Cosmic Run, which is one of the finest I have played in the genre.

Once upon a time there was a game called Scripts and Scribes. They renamed it to Biblios. Then they came out with a dice version of the game called Scripts & Scribes: the Dice game. And now they've revised that into Bibilos Dice. Which I've just played. I'm not sure if this is a proper new-to-me game as I played the S&S: The Dice Game... but that was 3 years ago and I don't really remember playing it.

The game is a series of tracks. You roll dice which have the track symbols on them. Then in player order you take all the dice of a certain symbol on them, and go up on that track. You keep selecting dice, player by player, until they are all gone.

There are goalposts along each track, where the first few people to cross them some points (more for the earlier players). And at the end of the game, the players get points based on the value of the track (which can be manipulated during the game) with the players getting double, single or half the value of the track if they're 1st, 2nd or 3rd. There's also penalties if you never advance very far on the track.

There's a special Bishop track which is used to break ties. It also gives neat bonuses when you hit the goal posts. And it gives you better and better rates to convert money to points depending on how far up you go.

There's also some other dice. One which gives money. Another which lets you change the value of one or more tracks by a point, either up or down depending. And there's a mule die which advances the mule to market.

When the mule gets to market, the active player divvies up the dice into two piles (one with 5 dice, the other with 3) and an auction begins. Players have bidding cards 0-7 and simultaneously reveal a card. This keeps repeating until everyone passes. The player who wins the auction pays full price and takes the dice of their choice. Second place pays half price and gets the remaining dice and everyone else keeps their money but gets nothing. The game ends when someone gets to the top of the Bishop track or when people, collectively, have gotten to the top of four of the other five tracks.

The game is interesting. I like the theme and the art a lot. I found the most engaging part of the game to be the auctions. I loved trying to figure out what other people will bid, and maneuvering so that I could either win the bid without paying too much, win second place to get the half-price discount, or just force other players to bid too much.

The dice selection in a normal round tends to involve little thought. Sure, there are decisions... but the considerations, like "Am I racing someone for a goal post bonus?" or "Do I want to partner up with Player X so that we both work on raising the value of the black track?" or "Do I ding the track someone else is winning on, or leave it for them to ding the one I'm winning on?", all seems very obvious. If there are multiple dice of a type, you're probably going to take that pile. That repeats until there are only single dice of any type. Then you weigh whether you need money or not, or if there's a track you really need to race for or whether you'll take the Bishop die. There's rarely a time when it's hard to decide which dice to take.

The main drawback of the game is the randomness. You can roll a large set on your turn and snag it leaving other players with a much worse choice. You can end up getting an extra die selection if the dice group up just so.

For example, our game was quickly decided when I rolled four bishops on my turn, ending the game. That let me advance to the top of the bishop track in a single bound. It also gave me two bishop bonuses which let me advance on four different tracks. Additionally, it let me convert gold to point efficiently... which some other players couldn't even do. It was like teleporting from halfway around the racetrack to the finish line and left a sour taste in more than one player's mouth.

RATING: 6
Both an improvement over and step down from Scripts and Scribes dice. Gone is the fast paced dice drafting of the original, replaced with a more thoughtful draft and auction. On the one hand, the pace suffers with new players and may not even be worth it even with 3+ (it reliably takes 45 min to an hour and should take 30 min at most).

On the other hand, there's much more of a game here. Every decision has an interesting balance and there are a lot of interesting mitigating factors in VP and Bishop bonuses for deciding where to advance. It's more reliably satisfying to play than it's predecessor, which could feel capricious and herky-jerky at times.

It's a hard one to rate, for while I can surely say that the changes in this version certainly are *improvements*, it's hard to say whether or not it makes the game *better*.

If I were going to write a review for this I'd call it: Who's on First?

With 2p this game is unnecessarily confusing when it comes to turn order.

Keep the following in mind: You roll the dice, move the pawn on the mule track, choose your dice, then your opponent chooses, then you if there are still dice, and so on until everything has been taken.

Then your opponent goes.

Then consider this: If you're the first player of "the round" you roll three dice for the ghost player and you advance their tokens.

Then this: If this wasn't an auction phase the first player switches.  So with 2p that means that you frequently take two turns in a row.  But then an auction happens and then you don't.

For us this breaks down immediately after the first auction.  Who's first?  Did I move the first player token over already to my opponent?  Have I played twice in row?  Did you?

The rules for all this are straightforward.  However, in this game you are changing player order constantly and then, suddenly, you're not.  It's too much confusion for such a light game!

I liked Scripts and Scribes Dice, but I got rid of it because I read this version was better.  In some ways it is.  I can see that the decisions are more interesting and there's a little more strategy.  But at this point, after two plays, I don't care.  I don't want to have concentrate so much on player order when I could be thinking about how to play the game.  

I'm probably being too harsh with my rating, but I feel strongly that the player order issue is a major flaw at 2p.  It's downright clunky and the complete opposite of how smoothly the card game flows.

So at this point, both S&S Dice and Biblios Dice are gone from my collection.  Put a fork in it for me at 2p, I'm done with them.

I like this game way better than Biblios. In video reviews everyone rates Biblios higher but Biblios Dice is excellent. It's still definitely a filler, but it feels like there is more strategy. I feel like there is less luck.

Maybe I didn't give it enough plays, but for me there just weren't enough interesting decisions for the play length. Great components though.

Of all biblios and script and scribe versions this is my favorite. The original card game is too monotonous after awhile. This dice version provides the same auction and draft feel and build up tension for majority in faster play format. Plus, I love the mule track to indicate and prepare for a coming auction.

I continue to be mystified over the target audience for diced-up versions of light Eurogames.  Are they...

* People with not [i]quite[/I] enough money to purchase the original version?

* Jocks who can grudgingly afford to spend 45 minutes on a game, but can't possibly waste 90 entire minutes on a game?

* Ameritrash diehards hoping to return to the Eurogame fold without fear of mockery?

* Readers who strongly enjoy book series, but sometimes prefer it when the second installment is a pamphlet instead of a book?

* Bronies recruited into the lunchtime gaming scene because their teleporn has been locked out with parental controls?


ANY-way, when you have Biblios Dice thrust upon you, I suggest that you follow my strategy guide:

Loved it, even if my son did beat me. We'll definitely be playing this more. :)

This game has a bit too much setup for what it is, but I still like it. However, the original Biblios is a step up and one of my favorite games.

Dice drafting and auctions, with highly upgraded components over it's predecessor, Scripts and Scribes Dice.  Really fun stuff.

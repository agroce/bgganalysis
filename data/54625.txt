RATING: 7
Gorgeous components continue the "must buy" tradition of an otherwise needlessly complex rules set.  The simplicity of the game is due to there only being a small selection of the 40K universe's characters in the game.  Fun nonetheless!

RATING: 9
An asymmetric tactical combat game fought between the few (but powerful) space marines and the innumerable horde of genestealers within a space hulk (a giant, ancient space vessel, made up of old space ships, asteroids, and space debris). It's a game with all the fluff, theme, and background of Warhammer 40k, but without the "collectible" aspect and with a good and simple set of rules! The minis and board pieces look absolutely great, and there's about as much flavor and theme as you could hope for in a game. The rules are easy to learn and teach, fast and furious, and intuitive. It's awesome!

The sand timer may be unnecessary, but its simple existence puts the pressure on the marine player. The overwatch rules are one of the awesome parts of the game; it's quite exciting when a genestealer is running towards your marine and you keep shooting at it, hoping you don't jam. The relatively short playing time is nice for such a great 2-player game.

RATING: 8.5
Probably the highest quality components for any industrially produced game, ever. Incredible-looking new limited edition incarnation of the classic 2-player tactical miniature game. It's brutal and highly luck-driven, but definitely a ton of fun to play! A true Ameritrash icon.

RATING: 9.5
SPACE HULK epitomizes my reasons for gaming.

Of all the games in my collection, this one has the best production quality I've ever seen.

The most detailed sculpts, the embossed boards, the thickness of all cardstock... everything.

Two minor niggles: (a) Some of the artwork on the sculpts is way too fine and is easily snapped off -- even if very careful. (b) The artwork on the sculpts tend to get in the way of the game. They tend to snag on each other and are awkward to handle and move about -- but that's just me.

Game play is basic, simple, and a great deal of fun. Highly recommend this classic.

RATING: 8
Хорошая тактическая игра с миниатюрами. Отличное исполнение картонных компонент (части поля, жетоны). Хорошее, но непрактичное исполнение фигурок. Им бы на полке стоять, а в коридорах Скитальца они постоянно падают, цепляются когтями друг за друга и привышают размер клетки поля (это всё в большей мере относится к генокрадам чем к десантникам). Такое положение дел вынуждает не пользоваться некоторыми фигурками без вынужденной надобности. Да и остальные стоит доработать (подставки утяжелить и т.п.) Но в любом случае игра интересна.

RATING: 9.5
Exemplary game. Extremely streamlined rules lead to furious, nail-biting action with barely any overhead.
The components are beautiful, although hard to remove from the sprues, but even the high detail embossed floor tiles are rich and hefty. Superb rulebook with photos covering nearly every eventuallity.

I'm not a games workshop fan, but they have done an amazing job with this game, and other publishers should start to worry if they get back into the board game business.

RATING: 4
I had the original version with a bunch of extra bits. I always wanted to LIKE this game, but for some reason I was horrible at it. I mostly lost as the Marine player. A lot of the scenarios were hideously unbalanced against the Marines, which I understand is actually the point. Even so, I always lost. I could be missing some fundamental strategy, or maybe the dice weren't in my favour. I occasionally wish I still had it, as my son would love it. I guess it just wasn't for me.

RATING: 5
All GW fuzz aside: it just is not that good of a game. Sure, components are great and the underlying theme could work if supported by a decent game. Truth is, the game is not broken but not working very well either. Two dice rolls can doom you and I wonder who decided that corridors necessarily have to be that narrow. Tactics don't win you the day and are usually so obvious that it is rather pointless to try different approaches. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
GW has taken the basics of WH40k and simplified it to a move and roll dice game with great minis. Instead of complicated rules set to simulate a boarding. GW has opt to use a roll and see who has the highest, to compare a win or lost situation. 

In such a way, a game could be done in 15mins and the tense moment of the timer does add to the overall effect. It also makes the game approachable by gamers of any level and experience. 

Overall, with the theme, it serves to be a gateway to WH universe and it's more complex system. The limited amount of minis, are also an encouragement to new painters to give it a go with sight of completion.  

Tense game especially for the marines. Great minis.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
First thing I've bought from GW in 20 years or so. Spectacular bits, if somewhat overcooked, and the unsteady figures can be annoying.The timer-induced-tension is fun. LATER EDIT downgraded: definitely overcooked, definitely annoying, awful rulebook, seriously contemplating moving this one to the trade list.

EDIT 2: genuine rating 5.5. '1' rating for GW's heavy-handed IP enforcement.

EDIT 3: back to actual rating. I want to play this as much as I want to play Thurn & Taxis, so rating amended to reflect this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
There's not a lot of game here for the genestealer player. Asymmetrical play is great but when one side's asymmetry is "not do anything particularly interesting" then the game suffers.

I hate timers since they make me anxious in the way that's not enjoyable. Rating reflects not playing with the timer, otherwise it would be like a 2 or something because it elicits that strong of a reaction from me.

update: changed rating from four to reflect my hatred of timers since I shouldn't rate a game based on house rules.

No he jugado a la versión de tablero sino a una versión de pc que respeta las reglas y la forma de jugar del original. Jugando con marines la verdad es que transmite esa sensación de agobio que tanto me gusta que da, por ejemplo, jugar con el vampiro a Furia de Drácula. Por otro lado, es un juego caro y difícil de encontrar, sólo para 2 jugadores y que supongo que acabe siendo repetitivo. Yo una vez completé todas las misiones en el de pc no volví a jgarlo.

Love this game, lots of fun and fairly replayable.  Dice luck can be important as a favourite genestealer tactic is to just hurl huge numbers at a marine and hope to swamp him.

Ah, Space Hulk. A wonderful, wonderful game, coloured perhaps by my nostalgia for the first edition which I played as a teenager. Guns against claws, tense, thematic. Yes, there's lots of luck in the dice rolls but if you play it quickly and get through a scenario in under an hour, the level of luck isn't overwhelming.

It's funny that I bought the game just because I learned about it from a fan site... JUST BEFORE GAMESWORKSHOP LAWSUIT WAS UPON THEIR HEADS!!! 
Well.. Had GW's obsession for their IP caused this intimidation on their fanbase a bit earlier, then I wouldn't have heard about 3rd Edition SH and therefore GW wouldn't have earned money from my purchase. And that would be fair enough. 
But now it's too late for that kind of fairness
Hence the removal of my rating

You want how much for what!?! Not my sort of game to start with, but throw in the ridiculous pricing and "made in China" on the box bottom and I am out. I played the original (1st Ed. Space Hulk) and I didn't like it either.

I managed to be talked into a game by my nephew - twice. My suspicions were confirmed . . . This is not the great tactical game that lots of folks are touting. It is probably better than the 1 I originally gave it, so, I give it a 2 - I won't be playing this one again.

Beautiful new components (although the miniatures are ridiculously overdone and way too elaborate, they do actually fit the mood of this game).

Regardless of what I think of GW's IP terror tactics, this is a great game!  The tension created for the Marine player by the timed turns and innumerable foes makes this drip with theme.  If GW cranked something like this out every couple of years they could have a major following in the board game community. 

Got everything but the figures on eBay for $40.  I'm currently using Lego figures for the marines and the Rock Striders from Nexus Ops for the Genestealers.  As soon as the dice start rolling, I can't tell the difference between these and the GW models.

RATING: 7
Perfect Ameritrasher for your average Eurogamer. Tight ruleset, puzzle-like gameplay and near-perfect rendition of theme (heavily armored marines vs. buglike alien beasts). Also, this is the only game in my collection for which I would actually prefer lower production values, since the sheer attention to detail and huge amounts of flair may intrude on the actual gameplay somewhat. I am not rating it higher only because of the ridiculous limited (un)availability and the already mentioned overproduction that unnecessarily pushes the price tag up. Oh, and GW are a bunch of a*holes, which kinda affects the overall enjoyment of the game.

An ill-timed gun jam can be the difference between surviving and failing. My favorite mechanism in the game simply has to be the hidden blip system for the genestealers. It's just so thematic. One day I'll gather up the nerve to actually paint my miniatures.

[i]Edited: 1/16/10, Rated: 9[/i]

What to do with this game?  The simple truth is that [i]Space Hulk[/i] is a fantastic experience for two players.  It's also an investment of money and of time.  The "versions" you've seen in the fancy pictures have been painted by talented people.  I'm not so talented, nor do I have the time to try.  I'm convinced games with miniatures are sold only to generate the more profitable secondary market for paint supplies.  But even without painting, a copy of [i]Space Hulk[/i] is an expensive proposition for a game that doesn't scale beyond two players.

Layered on top of that conundrum is the poor attitude displayed by the game publisher, Games Workshop.  You may have heard of the uproar they caused in November '09 when they [article=4256396]demanded that BGG remove user-generated content related to this, and other games of theirs[/article].  I don't explore a game fully when I first acquire it.  Instead, I prefer to spread my game time amongst multiple titles, and then later revisit the gems.  The action by Games Workshop threatens my enjoyment of this game: the materials which could enhance my experience are being removed and discouraged.  That leaves me less desirous of spending more time with it.

Does that make [i]Space Hulk[/i] a "1?"  No, not really.  More like an "8."  At the end of the day, it's still a fun game to play.

The pacing is perfect.  I love the idea that the human player is time-limited due to human reflexes being [i]slow,[/i] while the Genestealer player can take as long as she likes.  There's an important subtext to that ability, though: the longer the Genestealer player takes, the more time the Marine player has to think about his moves before the sand starts running.  The asymmetric nature of the two sides makes them play, and more importantly feel, very different.  The tension of watching opponents close with one another, always fearing (or hoping for) a jam is sublime.

So, if it's an "8," then why give it a rating that is a point higher?  Because playing [i]Space Hulk[/i] provides a memorable narrative that lasts long after the box has been put away.  My sons and my friends don't say things like, [thing=3076]"Remember that time I offensive captained you, and then shipped from my own harbor?"[/thing] or [thing=31260]"How about that time when I grew a carrot?"[/thing] They [i]do[/i] say things like "Remember that last-ditch stand by my Marine who gunned down five aliens in a row?" or "What about that one alien of mine who dodged all of that fire and killed both of your guys for the win?"  A game that has that kind of emotional impact is great, period.

Do I advocate rewarding a company who treats its own customers with little regard?  Absolutely not.  Is [i]Space Hulk[/i] a game you should try if you have the opportunity?  Unequivocally, yes.

Update: Downgrade to 8. It's still an awesome game, but there are a fair amount of edge-case rules and playing the Stealers is not as fun as the marines.

Unfortunately on 26-11-2009, BGG were instructed to remove all uploaded files all all GW games. Even those files with no copyrite material.

The games might be OK but the company attitude to it's customers is definitely broken. All my GW game ratings are reduced to '1's until GW mend their piss poor attitude to their client base and files are allowed to be reinstated..

So many things that I like about this game! First of all, the components are amazing. Obviously the figures are great, but the tiles are also very nice. Even the dice are cool! Gameplay is great. I like the timer for the marines. I like how quickly the play progresses. It has nice simple rules that work well. I also like the asymmetrical nature of the game.

This is just an extremely nice looking, very fun game. It was expensive, but I'm quite happy that I bought this.

Edit: Have had problems with warping boards. GW sent me some replacements. Hope those don't warp as well.

Edit2: Had to bump the rating down because I rated Claustrophobia a 10 and I just like it more than Space Hulk.

I previously gave the Space Hulk a good rating reflecting the nice work and quality components contained therein. With the revelation of the strong arm tactics (in my opinion) utilized by the GW legal department at the direction of management, with respect to copyright enforcement of fan generated materials. I withdrew my rating. I applaud the work of the GW staff and celebrate their efforts. I will not celebrate the un-enlightened policies of their management and legal departments.

RATING: 2
I had fun with the original, in a beer and pretzel shoot-em-up sorta way.  Thought my XBox addicted Middle Schoolers might like the reprint so purchased it.  So far, no joy.

The models are over the top complicated compared to the easy to assemble originals, no directions, and too dam fragile anyway.  The other components are too dark and busy to be able to easily distinguish.  There are rules for which weapon the figure is holding, with different capabilities for each, but I can't tell from looking at the figures.

My guess is the fan boys will love this, but it is not the easily approachable beer and pretzel game I remember.  Not complex in the sense of a good wargame, but it demands an investment in the whole, frankly silly, theme to even play.  If one of the kids really takes an interest I'll play, but otherwise not worth a grown man's time.

The most thematic boardgame I have ever played.  The game is a little finicky, but once you get a hang of all the rules they all just help to reenforce the theme.

RATING: 8
Fun game.  Be sure to make a sacrifice to the dice gods before playing!  In this game, the best-laid plans can be destroyed by a few dice rolls.  However it does make for a suitably dramatic game...  possibly the most dramatic in my collection.

Love the component quality, but obviously one pays for that.

I am nonplussed about the anti-GW sentiment right now (2009-11).  While I don't agree with GW's modus operandi, I won't rate the game a one in retribution, nor rate it a ten to try to offset others' ones...

One play in and I was surprised I didn't hate the game.  I had fun while playing even though my marines eventually lost.  I destroyed a mountain of genestealers before finally losing one or two key guys and having the game get out of hand at the end.

Did have an epic ending though, last two guys walking back to back slowly down the corridor and almost making it to the end while covering each other.

I still hate dice.  They decided way too many things in the game.

Best ever edition. The mini's are superb, but perhaps a bit too large for the boards. The board and counters are made from good thick stock and detailed. Game play is fun and dripping with theme.

Few plays now, pretty much similar to 1st Ed + Deathwing, so an '8' for me (which is how I rate Deathwing).

Curse you GW, had to go out and buy paints and stuff - thought I'd given up that part of the hobby.

*** Update, played it some more, and I dunno if it's nostalgia, but I really like it. Short, asymmetric, great bits, upgraded my rating a point ...

RATING: 10
GW did here a great job.
The components are just great and is worthy of a Anniversary Edition. Thumb-thik card boards, with gloss and press cuts and individual design. The plastic miniatures are awesome looking and very detailed. Maybe a little to detailed as some of these tend to break or dent easily. 

They pack all the good things of the 1st Ed. and the expansions into this. Some rules were streamlined. Also the polished rules helped the space marines to have a stand vs the genestealers.

Space Hulk manages to capture the atmosphere of the aliens film nicely. The adrenaline level rises high during the game. The pressure on the marines is bone-breaking and they must to have some good dice rolling to achieve victory in the name of the emperor. 
This game is very tactical and the use of the time limit for the marines is mandatory. Never play without it (expect in the first game).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A lot faster than my other Dungeon Crawls (Descent+ Doom). The plastic figures are slightly tricky to cut out and the components are a bit to big for my taste (hardly any scenarios fit on an 80 cm wide table, be warned!). The game is quite simple (and open to luck), but if you just want to blast some aliens/eat some marines it does the job.
Overall: Heavily recommended for a bit of work night die rolling.

RATING: 3
This bloated piece of crap gets my vote for most over-rated.  Despite all claims of tactical genius, it is a monotonous dice-fest.  It doesn't even rise to the tactical level of Hero Scape.  Somehow, five figures moving single-file down narrow corridors fails to excite me.  As long as I am ranting, I might as well point out  the shortcomings of the figures.  The Gene Stealers are too big for the board spaces and frequently fall over.  And what's up with the giant Space Marine armor?  Is it really doing them any good?  I have to wonder what the ratings would be if this game were released by Hasborg.  Not as great, I think.  But at least the game would be priced fairly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fulfills my expectation of theme, and is surprisingly strategic considering the simple ruleset.  With that said, I wouldn't call it incredible, and I think nostalgia is contributing to the overall score on the Geek.

Although how can one say since the overall rating for this game has been tainted and is now not reflecting the final product.  Ratings should be based on the quality of the product, not the douchebaggery of the publisher.

2 player only.

Box is too large for what it is.

Miniatures need to be removed from the sprues which has caused damage to more than one set I'm aware of.

Gameplay not significantly changed from previous editions.

The size issue could have been dealt with by changing out the components.  Start with using small wooden cubes (red) for the space marines and grey cubes for the genestealers, because it wouldn't change the game play one iota.  Add in the ability for the marines to fish or farm and build extentions to their space hulk and maybe this game would be better.

The components are top notch, and I've played with two and three players, and both worked out well.  I've been coveting this game since I was a kid, and never had a chance to play it.  Based on what I knew about it, and how great the reprint looked, I conviced my family to pool their money and get it for me for my birthday.  I'm really glad I did.  Go get this game!

Space Hulk is legendary for a reason.  It does the Aliens theme perfectly.  My only complaints are that the game can get a bit repetitive as many missions play very similarly with only different hulk layouts.

Having discovered BGG and gotten back into boardgaming just about 4 years ago, I missed out on the first two editions of Space Hulk.  By coincidence, I stumbled across the BGG entry for 2nd edition a few weeks before 3rd edition was released, and thought it looked interesting, but it was too expensive for an OOP copy.  Next thing I know, there is an announcement that it's being reprinted.  I immediately preorderd a copy.

Price:  personally I think this game is work every penny of the $100 I paid for it.  First, that included shipping so the actual price was $90 in my book - which is just $10 more than Descent's list price.  SH's components easily match up against Descents - fewer figures but much higher quality, beautiful tiles, rulebooks, markers etc.  I can't imagine anyone being disappointed by the compenents.

Gameplay:  I had somewhat low expectations, and expected this to be something like Heroquest, namely too simple to get me excited, but a good game to play with my 8 and 6 year old sons.

I was VERY pleasantly surprised.  The game play, though very simple from a rules perspective, is really quite challenging especially when you use the timer for the marines.  The game is so tense and deep, my boys are actually a tad overwhelmed.  In a few more years though, this will be a favorite I have no doubt.

If there was anything I could change about Space Hulk, the only thing I could think of would be to add MORE.  We need expansions with more missions, mostly, but more weapons, and more monster types would be cool too.

Any game whose only fault is that I like it so much that it cries out for expansions is easily a 9 in my book.

This is in response to GW's request to have most of their player aids and rules references pulled from BGG. While I understand that it is within their rights to do so, I also believe that their is such a thing as being NICE. That is, as long as someone isn't hurting you, you should be good to them, even if it is with in your rights to be a grade A jerk. I find people that are jerks in these situations to be extremely, extremely annoying. So annoying, in fact, that the annoyingness transcends all rules, game types, and genres. Needless to say, Space Hulk falls within this category and therefore gets a "2" rating, as it is 'extremely annoying". On the bright side, it is still not as bad as You Can't Check Me, not that I would ever buy either one or ever suggest to anyone one else ever to do the same.

I'm looking forward to playing through each mission, and I have experience with the 2nd edition predecessor.

Space Hulk is tricked out with this production, and they didn't introduce anything to detract from the good original gameplay. A very very well done update.

UPDATE: My opinon is that the game is a 10, but I do not encourage purhasing any products from Games Workshop due to their hostile stance toward BGG and fan web-content in general.

Until Games Workshop stops being foolish about this cease and desist thing my rating for this game will remain a "1". I am angry this happened after I bought this game because I will no longer be purchasing their products until the idiocy ends.

GW may trying to protect their IP, but they are merely angering their fans and actually slowing the growth of new fans for their games. Fools...

BGG ought to remove EVERY single GW game from the database until GW gets a clue. Games Workshop does not deserve the free advertising of their games they have been enjoying all these years now.

I finally purchased a copy of this for MrGeek. As it turns out, not my favorite game. It may be that I am not sneaky or blood thirsty enough, but I haven't managed to win a game yet. The rules are kind of complex and involving. MrGeek thinks it's great, but need a rules clean up. We both agree that the miniatures are awesome and that we are going to mod the heck out of it at some point.

While this game is beautifully produced I don't understand what all the fuss is about.  The game play is decent.  The modular board and various scenarios should result in a good amount of replayability.  The doors and miniatures are annoying.  The doors can block a player's view of the board.  Some of the minis are poorly balanced, thus tipping over easily.  Others are too large to fit into one square on the board.  I'd be just as happy if the minis and doors were cardboard chits.  Otherwise, after a single play, my impression is that seems like a decent mid weight war game.

Vicious, tactical and asymmetrical close quarter combat.

RATING: 10
Pimped out! :-)

Marines and Stealers are painted (as well as all 1st ed stealers and some intermediate ones so you can choose which you want to field), doors are painted as well. My very first paint-job, and I'm quite satisfied with that.

I have also lined the board pieces with black edding, created two sacks with logos for blips and command point tokens, and packaged everything in nice foam inserts.

The next step will be to paint a deathwing chapter and to make a patriarch (1st ed style). And then I'll create some 3D scenery ... (never gonna happen) ...

OK, I'm spending more time painting and thinking about painting and modelling and building than I am playing the game, but I'm LOVING it.

My favorite game.

RATING: 5
It takes a specific mindset to truly enjoy this game.  There is strategy and tactics involved, but at the end of the day, it's a luckfest due to the dice.  If you can accept that, and you'll love the game.  If you're the type of person that will get all upset when your Stormbolter jams while you're on Overwatch, then steer clear.  

The tales this game tells are epic.  I've won and lost nail-biters, and then I've suffered overwhelming losses (and maybe a few solid wins).  The thing is, I enjoyed the terrible losses just as much as the heroic victories.  Heck, there was one game where my last Space Marine was backed up into a corner facing off against 13 Genestealers!  I managed to take two down with me before being overwhelmed, but the feeling of helplessness and, in turn, the acceptance of my fate ("Well, I'm going to die, but I might as well take down as many of these suckers as I can") is what made the loss memorable and FUN.

When I first started playing I spent way too much time processing my options.  I believe that the game is not meant to be played like that.  Pick a plan and try to see it out.  If it works, cool.  If not, meh...  The dice can always change the outlook of the game at any time.

Only played a few times. An absolutely gorgeous production that made me seriously consider taking up painting minis again, but my eyes are too far gone for that. At least one of the early scenarios is broken, but this isn't a game you play for balance--it's pure experience and story. I wish the alien minis didn't fall over all the time, though. Ultimately it died for me due to the similarity of the scenarios...each game kind of felt the same.

RATING: 8
9-14-09: What a heavy box! I haven't had time yet to dig into the goodies, but it looks pretty impressive. Now I am mulling over whether to attempt to paint, or just dive right in and play. 

At this point, based on theme, gameplay, and production qualities, I must rate this game a 10. 

Edit - (November 27, 2009): Due to Games Workshop's recent decision to force BGG to remove most files supporting this and other GS games, I have removed my "10" ranking from this game. While I greatly enjoy playing Space Hulk, I no longer wish to contribute to the game's high ranking here on BGG. If and when GW reverses their stand, I will restore my ranking.

Edit - (2/9/2010): I have rerated SH at "8". It is a great game, and while I continue to believe that GW used a less than optimal approach when communicating their wishes to BGG regarding their IP, it seems clear now that GW does allow non-infringing material to remain posted, and that it is BGG that has chosen not to accept new SH files, even though GW is not prohibiting them from doing so. That being the case, my feelings against GW have softened and I have restored my rating, albeit a couple of points lower than my original "10". I did this because a) I would have really preferred pre-painted minis, considering the hassle I went through to produce decent looking models (-1 point), and b) I am going to have to dig around the Web to find additional missions, due to this ridiculous GW-BGG situation, which is still partially GW's fault (-1 point).

Space Hulk was always a great implementation of the theme, and a wonderfully streamlined, but tactical, rule set. This edition does not lose any of that nor does it let itself down in terms of the production value which is amazing. The initial price point may have seemed high but the amount, and quality, of what is in the box justifies it.  

It's good to see a compnay treat one of it's old and venerated, although now not core, products which such respect. Full marks to GW.

Gameplay (engine elegance, replay value, balance, rulebook writing), components (moddels, board tokens, extras), background (fluff) are all pure gold. I do not see a downside to this game apart from the fact that larger maps can take up to 15 minutes to set up (I hate long setups).

Played Suicide Mission and enjoyed it. Awesome components and theme really add to this game. The mechanics are fairly simple.  It's a nice tactical excersize of taking control of firing lanes.  Of course it's loaded with luck, but I don't really have a problem with it.  Reminds me of Mutant Chronicles..which I think I like better.  But Space Hulk mission complexity also go up with later scenarios, so rating could go up.

Hard to rate much higher honestly, due to cost and smaller amount of decisions to be made.  Plus there is that annoying C & D letter.  That's -1 point right there.

RATING: 10
Players either control an Genestealer (alien) infested derelict space ship, or a squad of marines boarding the ship.  Heavily inspired by the Alien movies, this is the 3rd edition of a 20 year old classic from Games Workshop.  The marine player spends action points to move and shoot their way through the ship, mapped out by jigsaw cut floor plans.  The marine player is handicapped by a 3 minute timer, to represent the fast moving aliens.  The Genestealer player them moves his "blip" counters around the ship, which convert into 1-3 aliens when bought into view of a marine.  Classic game, simple mechanics.  The marine is trying to blast his way through the scenarios, while the Genestealer player is trying to swamp and close with the Marines and wipe them out via hand to hand.  The rules have been tweaked up a bit from the earlier two editions, with stuff from the expansions incorporated here.  The components, however, have been given a lavish makeover ... chunky thick tiles with gorgeous art and individual debossing, and stunning plastic models. Games Workshop have raised the bar above anything else out there in terms of "bits".  The game plays like a 20 year game - very retro, but great to see this classic back in print.  Beautiful remake.

A yet-more-refined version of a classic fun game! Highly recommended.

Don't get me wrong, this is a very good game with a wonderful production.  However, I think the general opinion on Space Hulk may be somewhat inflated by nostalgia and awesome paint jobs.  This is probably sacrilege, but I'd probably have preferred less over-the-top minis.  Personally, I don't find it to be the masterpiece it seems to be revered as and think DOOM the Boardgame is overall a more interesting sci-fi pew pew fix.

RATING: 9
In the modestly average landscape of games published in 2009, this edition of Space Hulk puts the HOBBY back in hobby gaming with a capital "H".   Simply put, the most lavishly produced components I have ever seen in a game, and hands-down the best and most detailed miniatures that Games Workshop has ever produced.   The love in this production oozes out of every component.  GW has the best "fluff" (art and backstory) of any intellectual property in the industry.  It really sets the bar for what a $100 game should include (and as a side-effect, it emphasizes where Rune Wars and Horus Heresy fall short of the $100 mark in terms of production values). The game istelf is an old-school classic -- tense, tight, overwhelming, short, quite light, and thematic to the Nth degree.  "Command Points" and "Overwatch" will become your favorite new phrases.  Lots of strategic options and small squad tactics for the Marines make it a blast to play.

Space Hulk is one of my favorite games, just solid all around with a brilliant mix of streamlined action point rules with tense, tight and exciting. It has rules that evoke the theme of the game and a setting that feels like a movie unfolding in front of you. The way the game creates a narrative is tough to match and really no other game I feel creates such a compelling story. The one downside in this production is the models, they look amazing but their practical use is low. Top tier game.

I would like to trade a copy of Space Hulk, which has been opened to verify that the miniatures inside were not destroyed by the weight of the cardboard (all models still on sprues and cardboard pieces still shrink wrapped), for Zombicide Season 1 and/or Season 2 kickstarter exclusives.  Anybody?

Good board game. 
Pro
* models are different color to make it easy to distinguish what each model has 
* game play is easy to learn
* rules can be modified easily for beginners to learn the game.


Con
* setup of board takes time.
* packing everything in a single box is pain.

When the original Space Hulk came out in the 80's I was lucky enough to be traveling in the UK with my family.  On our last day in London I convinced my folks it would be ok if I separated for a bit, and so I ran a kilometer through downtown London to pick up the game.  It was worth it then and it's worth it now.  What a great edition of a fantastic game!

Space Hulk is great game. I've used to play Space Hulk SP on my PC and boardgame version gives the very same desperate feeling. Both players has to spent every AP wisely. Still I have one complain. The miniatures are impractical (nothing new from GW) and some poses look stupid or foolish. When the board is hoarded with minis it is hard to adjust miniature's facing or move one without knoking over rest of the miniatures.

What a rush this game is, at least for the Space Marines player. For example: I had 7 guys, each with 4 APs plus whatever bonus APs I pulled from the bag and only had three minutes to make my moves. That's 28+ actions to program in 3 minutes. Talk about pressure! The timer ticked down to single digits on more than one occasion. 

My guys had to go retrieve an artifact (a chalice, because ya know, you need that for drinking in space) and then get out the way they came in. I was able to daisy-chain the chalice back across the board to the guy with the flamer who had to burn his way out through three Genestealers. He flamed two of them and only had to roll a 2-6 to kill them. I rolled a 1. Twice. I guess it had run out of fuel. He died two spaces from the exit. Epic. Classic SH. Great story, and a lot of fun.

The setup is a bit tedious (why didn't they number the board pieces?!) but can be mitigated via some teamwork.  When the game is "on" and the luck is about even, it can shine as a tense tactical battle that can go either way and come down to the wire. Having someone roll 6s all night can make it less so. Still it's a one-of-a-kind game that every gamer should try once.

I always like the atmosphear of this game, the struggle against odds. But I always felt it's a bit TOO MUCH casual, since sometime you loose or win a game by a single throw (almost).

There is a lot of hype surrounding the new 3rd ed release. However, I like to tell myself (delude myself?) that I'm above the hype because I've ranked Space Hulk a solid 10 since 1st edition.

Everything I love is still there, plus MORE. Hell, the hype is warranted. This is a great game.

Extraordinary looking components that are produced with many flaws and are carelessly packaged. Delicate parts are simply crammed without cushioning into a box that is too small. The heavy components aren't secured in the box and slide back & forth snapping plastic and scraping tiles. Even if the outside of the box appears to be perfect, some components are likely damaged. Also, my board tiles warped over an eighth of an inch off the ground after only a few weeks! All of this senselessly detracts from my enjoyment of this otherwise great product.

Manufacturing & packaging sucks :(

Gameplay & aesthetics are awesome!

I'm giving this a ten after 3 solo games. I just wanted to get the rules down, but after the first game I couldn't stop. It's very intense, and very short, so you could play many games of this in an evening. I'll have to see how it holds up after repeated plays, but for now, it is my only ten and it surpassed Arkham Horror (which is still very awesome, but takes longer to play, while this game is also very immersive and takes way less time)

RATING: 8
After 3 plays, I see the fun this game brings to the table. I'm not sure it met my expectations after all the hype, but I'll have to play it more to really know. I found the rules for this, basically, miniatures system, to be pretty good. I don't see as much depth in strategy as I'd like, largely due to how confined so much of the play area is, combined with line of sight rules limiting firing / covering fire / bounding fire opportunities. Although lacking a bit (and I mean a bit) in depth, they are quite elegant. The rules and game play lend themselves well, it seems, to forcing players to adapt to each sides strengths and weaknesses while applying strategy to complete the mission. 

I find the Marines the most interesting side, at least in the early going, due to a wider variety of weapons. This allows you to make a more involved battle plan. I think in later scenarios, more about the Gene Stealers will be revealed. I find them a bit harder to play, overall. There are just so many of them. There are ways to force the Gene Stealer player to think it through. In scenario 2, for instance, you get a huge load of models, but they are very finite. So, you can't really just throw bodies away.

I'll try to update these comments if I play some more games. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I'd play anytime.  Light rules and awesome bits.  Ultimate theme game.  The rules are about as heavy as Memoir '44 but with more tension.  The lack of hit points for the models really keeps the game moving along.  Bloody and exciting!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is an absolute crapfest of luck, but at the same time, there's a great game there.  The smallest of decisions can have a huge impact, and I think the game leaves a lot of room for creative strategies and tactics.  The time pressure on the marines' side makes it even more enjoyable.  

For the genestealers, it's more a game of bluff and timing.  Trying to find the weak link in their armor.  Not quite as interesting of decisions, but it's more satisfying when you take down a marine.

I just plays fast and tight.  Everything is appropriate for what it is.

2009 release: 20 years on, Games Workshop give us...Space Hulk deluxe.  Massively improved production values, with a truly awesome set of components, plus a revisit to the 1st edition rules with a few tweaks and additions such as Librarian rules that actually work well (unlike the original Genestealer expansion) and the super-hard Broodlord.  Worth the hefty £60 price tag, definitely a must-have.

2016 update: £60 seemed like a lot for a game back then.  How times change, eh?  I spent my youth loving Space Hulk but I'm more of a euro gamer these days, didn't see any reason to pick up the ever-so-slightly-different 4th edition.

   Played a few times then gave my copy to die hard GW fan who couldn't afford it otherwise.  At least he'll have fun painting up the plastic.  Maybe that's a tad harsh as the game isn't totally boring.

   For me there are far better dungeon crawlers (even in space, ie. Azanti High Lightning).  The 40K background is just too goofy for my tastes.  Finally far too expensive for what you get.

I enjoyed Space Hulk for my first couple of plays. Afterward, I could no longer justify keeping a game where the weight of success or failure is based so much on the dice rolls. Much better dice-combat games have very well-thought-out systems to mitigate dice rolls. Space Hulk tries - good lord it does - to keep things balanced. But it really doesn't. I think fans recognize this and like it just as a very thematic, claustrophobic 2-player combat game. And it is that. But for me, I need a bit more of a deep game to keep my brain occupied.

[b][i]Space Hulk[/i][/b] is what dungeon crawl games should be: simple, fast, and fun. Many games of this genre are burdened by convoluted line-of-sight and combat rules. Space Hulk, on the other hand, is simple enough to keep the game progressing quickly with significant tension. It's also complicated enough with varied scenarios to allow for a good dose of strategy.

Oh, and the components are top-notch (and top-dollar).

What can I say but that Games Workshop has made one of the best games of all time that much better. The component quality is through the roof, the rules are a combination of the first edition with rules from one of the expansions, the number of missions is doubled, the dice are custom, even the door holders are molded to fit in with the theme. What's not to like unless you just don't like to have fun playing games?  If I could give this game an 11, I would.

Space Hulk 3rd edition is all the best elements from the first edition and it's expansions and the second edition and THEN improved.

2 player games are always welcomed in my home.

I brought my 30 pound box of goodies home, and holy cripes are the components awesome! Based purely on the components, this sucker is worth every penny.

Compared to games like Descent, the quality is 10-fold better for nearly the same price. The minis are gorgeous, the tiles are the thickest I've ever seen, embossed, and need no trimming or cutting to remove.

The gameplay itself? It's very 90's, and really can't compare to the much more elegant and amazing games coming out these days. However, it's a really cool game, with amazing components. The tiles in mine started to warp after a few hours out of the box, but that's the only thing bad I can say about the quality here.

While it is quite simple, there are a lot of room for tactical manouvers and also some strategical depth. It's just that I don't seem to be that passionate about it. The game is good and the game is fun, yet the game doesn't engage me in the way Descent do. I think the reason behind that is that I prefer the theme less here and that Descent has a lot more chrome.

I have played two missions and I found those mission to be very different in the way you have to execute the tactics. The different sides make the game even more replayable.

Tendency: I don't expect the rating to go down and I might even raise it to an 8 or a 9.

2009 acquisition.

I have removed my rating for this game based on the actions of GW over fan-made content (not because I lost a couple games to Thijs :P  ). I will no longer be supporting or purchasing any future GW game.

I rated it a solid 7.5 before I removed the rating.  I'll be playing this game for years to come but there are lots of other games I can spend my money on so no more GW games for me.

Yes, I paid $100 for this game.

I've then proceeded to play it a bunch of times and enjoyed each one. Even including setup and teardown it's a 60-75 minute game, full of tension. And once I commit to figuring out a better storage solution, I'll probably shave time off setup, too.

Really, what's not to like?

I thought I had this monster subdued when I drug it home.  However, once I cracked the seal, it punched me in the teeth, ate my dog, and stole my car!  Awesome!

I'm so glad they produced such a beautiful new edition!  It's 10 times better looking than the original.  It's also an A+ effort on GW's part.  They could easily have flopped out a lazy effort.  

I like the new rules, as well.  The game has deceptively simple rules to play, but the tactics to win are deeper than the mechanics would imply.  I don't expect to ever tire of playing this gorgeous behemoth.

First play in many years was a little shaky. My opponent had never played, and I think he felt shafted by the overwhelming odds and unclear choices (my fault). Next time I'll do better.

RATING: 8
I really like 1st edition.  I disliked how they took the timer out of 2nd edition and a couple other things that I don't remember.  I'm glad they put the timer back in.  It's kinda nice that they went ahead and ACTUALLY put a timer in, but I kinda miss that the Sgt/ and Capt's added time.  But, that's fine.  I'm not sure I like the adding the 'CC Overwatch'.  But, I can live with that.  I don't think I like that you 'go back on overwatch when you clear your jam'.  Kinda annoying.  BUT, with limited CPs I don't know if it's going to end up mattering enough to go past annoying.

The tiles are great, but I wish they were so much thicker then the others.

The models.  Well I guess the are great for people like Dan.  But, I got out of 'miniature' gaming for one reason, because I dind't have the time or the talent for the painting.  I d think there is two sides of miniature gaming.  The gaming and the hobby.  The models are great for the hobby side of it.  The gaming side of it, the genstealers are a bit annoying.  Then you think, hey this isn't a miniature game, this is a board game.  I actually prefer to call the 'plastic' bits that come with board games as either plastic bits or plastic board game figures.  To me they aren't miniatures.  So, really they are 'over produced' in my opinion.

I can see me getting people into it and then switching to 1st edition.  Although, I have no problems with the rules set, so I might just use the 1st edition tiles (much more) and the figures (much easier to use).

Because the 'human' player is under a time limit, I find it interesting and fun the throw in 'miscommunication' into the mix.  So, I like to play Missions where there are two squads and each squad is run by each person.  Then when one person draws and looks at those Command Points the timer starts and now one person has to take care of his squad while keeping track of the CPs and communicating with the other guy whom needs to ask for CPs when they need them and hope the other player is keeping them in mind.  It's a wonderful addition to the stress.

Yes, yes this is the one. I personally don't think this is quite as evocative as Aliens as others think--for a game evocative of Aliens, I play Aliens.
This has a flavour all its own. The Terminators are powerful, seemingly invincible, until a 'stealer gets in One Good Shot. And there are oh so many 'stealers.
The third edition has ridiculously gorgeous components. The tiles must be seen to be believed. The minis are insanely detailed, so much so that I could never dream of painting them--but they look great unpainted.
The game is simple, very fast (45-60 mins), and very fun. I am in no way confident that any of the missions are balanced--but (and this is very uncharacteristic of me) I don't really care.
[EDIT] Yes, Games Workshop has done some objectionable things. I will not devalue the utility of BGG as a database further by changing my rating.

The missions are so different.  What a great game and entry into 40K.  Based on the pretty quick play time, light rules, and insanely good theme and components, this could end up ranking higher.  

The tactical play is almost puzzle like- one space over can make a world of difference.

Too bad it is only 2 players!  The nice thing is anyone with some 40K minis can house rule up a 3 or 4 player version.

UPDATE: 2nd play made me say wow- this is the best tactical skirmish game I've played.

RATING: 8.25
got a figureless set and sorted my own mini's. God, breaking up a cool boardgame. the GW sharks have spawned ebay money grabbing sharks. like touts of touts with front row seats, real scumbags. Typical GW though:
"you will be taken to court if you dare to post an FAQ pdf on the internet. But some donkey raping cock master can charge 25 quid a pop for 2nd hand singles of our minis on ebay. thats fine."
Anyway, game is as cool as ever, scenarios are puzzles to be solved, rather than real scenarios, which sucks some theme away. I would give it a 9.5 if it didn't have GW written on it. Probably be a 10 with lots more decent scenarios. but that obviously never gonna happen beyond torrent sites

Painted

Have since picked up all the minis.
Genestealers painted
Marines Base coated. can't be arsed to get them started due to every figure having so many, exactly the same, skulls and chains and school sports day rosettes to paint, mega yawn!

20th Sept 2014: bought the 2014 re-release & WD33. Keeping mint. Going to pass this onto my boy when he is old enough. Hopefully GW will go under in the next ten yrs, then he will own a piece of history that will be worth more than its own weight in weapons grade Plutonium! If you can't beat em, join em, eh!?

RATING: 7
Alright, only one play, but here’s my pros and cons:

CONS:

1. Spaces are too small. Many genestealers especially will not be able to fit if another figure is on an adjacent space. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that facing matters, so you can’t just turn them sideways to fit.
2. Sculpts are too busy. Figures have a lot of detail, which is great, but can be confusing (at least unpainted). I found it difficult to distinguish the flame unit by his weapon, and had to go more by what pose he was in.
3. Facing rules. I didn’t personally care for the facing rules, but they do make sense. The bigger complaint here is that it is difficult to tell which direction people are facing. That might sound strange, but it mostly happens because the figures seem to be looking in directions that are not aligned with one of the sides of their rectangular bases. So to have them facing a certain direction is to have their base cockeyed to the spaces on the board. It’s easy enough for you to remember which way your guy was facing, but difficult for your opponent to tell at a glance.
4. Mobility issues. Your figures cannot move or shoot past each other. In a game mainly comprised of hallways and 3x3 rooms, this is problematic. This seems like something you would get used to and be able to plan for much better as you get used to the game, but I still felt handcuffed by it to a degree.
5. The timer. The sand constantly got stuck. Not an uncommon problem for a sand timer, but in a game with this degree of quality, you would think it wouldn’t be an issue.

PROS:

1. Components. No surprise here. The boards, figures, chits, etc. all look amazing. Despite the complaints above with regard to them, this is one nice-looking game.
2. The blips. It’s no secret that the feel of this game is much more Aliens than 40K. Before you can draw line of sight to an alien, it shows up as a green chip that moves around, simulating your radar. When you see it, it is revealed to actually be 1, 2, or even 3 genestealers. This may have been my favorite part of the game. It does a great job of (a) increasing the tension, (b) fitting in wonderfully with the theme, and (c) making you plan for the unknown.
3. The timer. Yeah, believe it or not, I liked the timer in this game. If you don’t, you could just play without it. But I liked how it made it feel like you had very little time to get everything done. In many cases, running short on time, you are better off doing nothing, or just putting someone in overwatch rather than make a poor hasty move, so running out of time is not a huge penalty, but you really do want to keep moving.
4. Overwatch. Basically this means spending 2 action points (each figure has 4 per turn) to let your marine completely unload on anything that comes into his line of sight on your opponent’s turn. Lots and lots of times. Every time a genestealer moves, attacks, sneezes, breathes, whatever and your guy on overwatch can see him, he takes a shot. This generally manifests itself as a genestealer charging down a hallway shrugging off bullets with every step until he either takes one to the skull, or reaches the marine and shreds him to bits. In melee combat, genestealers roll three dice and pick the highest. Marines only roll one. Which leads me to…
5. Assymetry. The two sides are markedly different and make great enemies for each other. The marines are bulky and slow moving, and need to spend an action to turn. They have limitless range, and can wreck aliens with their guns from a long way away. The genestealers spend no action points to turn, can move 50% faster, and have much greater numbers. They have no ranged weapons at all, but are deadly from close quarters. Your genestealers feel much more expendable and you want to rush them into their deaths praying for a marine’s gun to jam. Whereas playing the marines, you will almost cry when one of your guys buys it. (Game over man, game over!)
6. Gun Jams. In overwatch, you get a shot everytime something moves in your line of sight on your opponent’s turn. On your turn you get a free shot with every move. That’s a lot of shooting. Your marines roll two dice, and if either one is a 6, you get a kill. If you fire at the same target again, you only need a 5 on either one. However, if you roll doubles, your gun jams and it will cost you one action point to un-jam it. If you are out of action points with a jammed gun and a genestealer charging at you, well, it was an honor serving with you.
7. Command Points. Each turn, you draw a tile with a 1-6 on it. If your commander is still alive, you may redraw this. This gives you a secret (from your opponent) number of action points to spend on any marine you choose. These are especially useful for un-jamming guns in overwatch, as the four actions per marine do not carry over to the genestealer turn if unspent, but command points do. These are also great for when your marine just needs that one more step or one more shot.

CONCLUSION
            All in all, this is a quality game with great atmosphere and tension. It can be a little fiddly what with facing and turning, but once you get used to it, it does a good job of simulating a classic sci-fi battle. It’s not the second coming people have made it out to be, but it certainly has its merits. In general, if I was going to play a “combat in the corridors” kind of game, I would prefer something like Descent, mostly because I like opening chests, upgrading characters, getting new weapons, etc. and you won’t find that here. But it does take the basic dungeon crawl formula and boil it down to combat, combat, combat, so if that’s your thing, you will love this.

Beautiful minis! Great theme, and awesome tension with good balance for both sides. And, my wife plays it as well. A clear winner.

The tactical possibilities in this game are, while not endless, very vast. Both players face tons of interesting decisions, with the marine player (with all his different weapons, plus the time pressure) being under a bit more stress - which is exactly how it's supposed to be.

This is a game that stood the test of time. Too bad recommending it rarely works with a good conscience, since it can barely be found anymore.

Hmmm I can't autodestruct anymore?  Some rules have been simplified, sometimes it's an improvement and sometimes not.  The sculpts  are wonderful (but impractical).  

Space Hulk stays a very pleasant game with a fun theme, but that's it; a solid 7 (actually my rating for the 1st edition is higher).

And GW and the "limited edition" thing suck.  The game cost me 120€, so maybe I'll sell it; apart from board, there is no improvement worthy of a new edition.

RATING: 7
Space Hulk is always tauted as a keystone in dungeon crawl design. Now I understand why -- it's the UR-text for designing dungeon crawl games from next-to-nothing (it's somehow even more pared down than Claustrophobia). The two differing factions are highly asymmetrical and to good effect: the tension is quite high as the well equipped but slow moving space marines fend off a swarm of quick but short ranged genestealers (think Aliens, the movie). One hit = one kill in this game so every decision matters -- the risks and rewards are always high in this game but the rate of success is low. Accordingly, the game creates a rich stress-full space which might have some praying to the dice-god of their choice. You can almost taste the space marine sweat as you fire shots into those long narrow corridors!

Plus, the production quality is gorgeous (I'm not sure if I can stomach the 300+ dollars myself though).

Ich finde es einfach unglaublich, bewusst von einem ganz gut laufendem Spiel nur eine so geringe Anzahl an Examplaren herauszugeben. Das ist für mich nicht nachvollziehbar und sehr ärgerlich. 

Dieses Verhalten von Games Workshop werde ich mir vormerken und sicherlich auch keine Werbung für diesen Verlag betreiben. Ich werde sogar versuchen, so wenig wie möglich von diesem Verlag zu erstehen (so wenig wie möglich, weil ein gutes Spiel nunmal ein gutes Spiel bleibt...egal, bei welchem Verlag es herauskommt)

Naja...am liebsten würde ich das Spiel schlecht bewerten, um den Verlag meine Missgunst zu zeigen. Da aber das Spiel selbst und der Spieleautor nichts dafür können, bewerte ich dieses Spiel einfach gar nicht...

A true classic returns!  An awesome birthday gift!!!  I stupidly sold my 1st edition set nearly 10 years ago and regretted it ever since.  Now, it is back and better than ever!  The chrome is phenomenal and the rules actually include a lot of the extra expansion stuff I never had the first time.  I only wish it had more scenarios, but, the promise of a scenario editor tool and the bgg community will certainly insure that there will never be a lack of adventures for this one.  If only it wasn't so limited, so EVERYONE who wants a copy could get one.

Very atmospheric rendition of a man-vs-alien setting pitting superior human weaponry against cunning lightning-fast claws. The time-limited turn for the human player will forces the marines to plan quickly and recreates the split-second decision making of the squad leader. The possibility of human victory also slowly deteriorates with every passing turn since only the alien swarm receives reinforcements. The semi-hidden alien movement is a creative mechanic and further adds to the atmosphere. Beautiful miniatures, components and map tiles.

Don't you just love GW? It attempts to get everything into one box, but not everything carries over from the First Edition, no ranged weapons for Genestealers for instance. Great production values, gameplay just the same.

When your brother-in-law owns it....there's no need to have your own copy

Probably one of the best two-player tactical games. I love the asymmetric play. The Space Marines need to play in strategic defense. Guarding all routes while having to move deeper into enemy territory (depending on the campaign parameters). The Tyranids need to effectively control a possible hoard of aliens.

This game gives you the same feelings from the movie 'Alien.' Having the Tyranids appear as 'blips' on the board was very thematic. You never know how many there truly are. Terrible danger is always lurking around the corner.

Simple rules, tense action, 1-shot kills, modular board, several missions included (and fan-made ones scattered online)...  An unforgiving game of excitement.  This might be my favourite 2-player game of all time.

Got on ebay x2 (one copy punched, half painted, never used; second copy punched, unpainted, gently used, boards slightly warped), January 2012.  I'm partially done painting one set.  I'll probably sell/trade a set once both are painted.

11-27-2009: Changed my rating to a 1 (from a 8) because GW had BGG remove ALL user generated files. There was some great stuff by fans that GW thinks infringes on their intellectual property.

Finally!  I can now enjoy the Warhammer 40K universe without having to take out a second mortgage.  I can also play multiple games in a single afternoon as games only take about 1 hour or so to unfold.
3rd edition has some fantastic production quality.  Yes the game costs $100 (probably more now that it is out of stock everywhere) but you do get what you pay for.  Beautiful sculpts on the plastic figures, embossed map tiles, tons of counters and chits all made of some impossibly thick cardboard with a glossy finish.

Everyone knows Space Hulk. This edition has absolutely overwhelmingly smashing components and rather clear rules. What I love about SC3ed is how simple, engaging and totally unforgiving it is. Sharp and tough as a true diamond should be...

Edit: I changed my rating from 8 to 9, because although I believe GW to be acting weird and fanatical with their C&D letter, I also believe that the people who put their work in this fantastic game deserve a better treatment from a community that believes itself to be balanced, matured or simply "in the right". Shame on all the immature and fanatical, so blinded by mindless rage that they let the BGG rating system become faulty.

This is a very simple and quick playing game that has great components (3rd edition) and some good tactical depth.  For me it is a 7 but my kids have been playing it a lot and rate it higher, so I've bumped it to an 8.

One major problem with this game is the extremely delicate figures. I would prefer they were made of more durable material, even if that means somewhat less detail.

Finally played it now. Feels very much like a miniatures skirmish game. Heavy on tactics and understanding how to use your troops, but because of the speed and brutality the strategy is lacking somewhat for me.

The absolutely idiotic decision by GW to remove all files that were player created which largely contained no property of their own (some did sure) is why I rated this a one, something I would never normally do.

First, it is beautiful.  Unfortunately, it is too much work for what it is.  Setting up a scenario takes up a ton of space and time and the game play is lacking.  The game promotes some bad tactics and some of the scenarios are just plain dogs. A skirmish game like this should play quick and not drag on.  I love the blips, BTW.

RATING: 7.8
A labor of love.  It took a couple years to paint with a buddy as we periodically found time to get together and pass some time painting the game pieces.  It looks unbelievably great and is a lot of fun to play, even though the gameplay itself feels a little dated.  Setup time is a little long, which makes it harder to get to the table on a whim.  After 7 years, I'm seeing some boards warp slightly, which is surprising given the thickness.  I think these are the thickest boards to any game I've had short of Sunrise City.

RATING: 9
Space Hulk captures its intended essence and feel brilliantly. The action point system provides a smooth framework for the game, and the rest of the ruleset is quite intuitive. The inclusion of a timer is a nice design choice,  creating added tension for the Space Marines player. The variety of weapons and corresponding rules are highly thematic, and the missions introduce you to these features of the game gradually. The components are of the finest quality, yielding superb aesthetics. The game plays quickly, allowing for short sessions and switching sides. Sure, the actual gameplay is mostly positional tactics and rolling dice, but the result is a fun, memorable gaming experience unlike anything else I've played.

RATING: 8.5
An outstanding tactical space-crawl game for 2.  These figures are each unique and incredibly detailed while the paper-stock production is the best I've ever seen.  We play w/o the timer and the understanding that the SM has roughly 3 minutes in which to complete their turn, so far we haven't had a problem with this.  Knowing how much to save and when to use CPs w/Overwatch is essential.  I'm having a great deal of fun playing Space Hulk with my 16 yr old son who likes to verbalize/role-play (using his Cartman voice) while making his tactical decisions.  He cracks me up every time.   Booyah!

**September 2010 - finished all the scenarios and sold at a good profit**

Couldn't care less about the storm in a teacup regarding GWs (justified) practices, rating games down just hurts BGG, not GW. In fact the general level of entitlement (HOW DARE THEY ASK TO REMOVE MY PLAYER AIDS!!!) from some users just shows that this community isn't all its cracked up to be. BGG removed ALL the content, not GW and users should be aware of what they can and can't use for fan made materials.

RATING: 8
Space Hulk got a lot of hype when the third edition got released by Games Workshop. I fell for it, especially after watching and reading Florence's and Barnes' reviews. I got the game for a reasonable price, but still a very high price for any boardgame. The components are the best I've ever seen for a boardgame, and the theme is absolutely fantastic, set in a very rich universe, and tapping into an Alienesque storyline, with hopelesness and despair as its main theme. Each mission seems impossible, if it were not for the totally badass Space Marines that are recruited for the missions. Gameplay is simple and quick, there is a lot of randomness and excitement, but movement seems to have a chess-like calculability, where efficient movement and carefully securing all hallways and corners are the way to victory. The aliens just need time to win, so speed is of the essence. An incredible tense game, with incredibly wobbly alien figures that hook into each other and fall over.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Our first experience with 'Ameritrash', and I have to say we're pretty impressed. Even beyond the phenomenal production values, the game has enough depth and variance to keep it interesting.

I was a bit apprehensive that my wife wouldn't take to it based on the theme, but she quickly jumped in and enjoyed the game despite the tense sci-fi atmosphere. So much so that we've been splitting the wins pretty evenly.

The only thing really keeping it from a higher score, is that it really is a game you need to be in the right mood to play. It requires a lot of thought, and puts a fair amount of stress on the SM player to quickly optimize their turns. There are nights that I devour experiences like that, but then there are others where I'd just like a nice calm game of dice rolling or cube pushing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Same Space Hulk flavor, but in a more forgiving package.  The changes made with the third edition make for a much more even game as the Marine player is no longer required to think that a single mistake (or a turn of bad luck) can cause him to lose the entire game.

Still prefer 1st edition rules and am not thrilled with a close combat sargeant. That being said, the production value on this is better than almost any game out there.

A definite step-up from 2nd Edition, a little more options and tactics for Space Marines although the Genestealers still play the same way.

Components are good: nice thick cardboard tiles, minis look good, but are impractical (tiny bases that topple over and are impossible to view direction of facing). This is critical for Space Hulk so I'm not sure how such an oversight could have been made.

But other than that the game is still lots of fun and can be played as a quick 1 hour game or a 5 hour campaign.

Even with some minor rule confusion this game's become an instant hit.  I can't tell you if it's worth the humongous price tag, but I can tell you it was for me.  This is the game that may have actually brought my father into board gaming.  For that, the $200 price tag is more than justified.  Mechanics-wise the game plays like X-Com: The Board Game.  Like an asymmetrical chess game where some pieces can shoot and others can bumrush you and open your throat like a christmas present.  All that coupled with the RIDICULOUSLY high quality parts make this one of my favorites from both a gamer and collector perspective.

I went nuts trying to get this game, and now I don't have interest in it.  I don't know what's wrong with me.

The guy I originally got this from traded it to me, but 3 of the minis are broken -- one of the Genestealers needs his arm glued back on, and two of the space marines need their arms re-attached as well.

Needless to say, I was upset about this, too.

It's going to have to be a pretty good offer to make me trade this, even with the 3 broken minis.

The game is fun, but I have not yet made up my mind how much I like it.  My one big complaint would be the darn miniatures - they're too brittle, too detailed and many of the sprue connections are poorly placed; it's pretty much impossible to detach them without causing some damage.  They're also too big for the boards.  It would almost seem the boards and models were designed by independent groups that felt no need to consult with each during the design of the game.

Further update.  Raised to a 10.  I've played more than 400 games, more than 250 this century and hundreds in the '70s and '80s.  This is one of the best and although it now sells for hundreds of dollars it's one of the few I'll never part with.  And although some misguided grognards waged a campaign to vote otherwise, this is a great wargame to introduce thematic gamers to the wargaming hobby.

Update.  After a few more FTF plays with my son who is now older, this game really rocks!  The tactics of overwatch, and the bluffing of the blips for the Genestealers, really makes this game exciting and tense.

Initial rating based on some solitaire play and some plays with my 9 year old son.

Easy to learn, fun light wargame.  Great components.  If you want to introduce someone who likes sci-fi to wargaming, this is the game to do it!  Easy enough for a kid (9 year old) to learn and do well at.

RATING: 8.5
Had I known it was coming out, I would have bought this in a heartbeat instead of making my own copy.  

*Update* Well, I've played this edition a few times now and I'm really irritated by the minis, which look great when they're standing still.  

But they are in static poses meant for a diorama.  Many of them look silly moving around the board, especially the genestealers hanging off the walls or climbing over stuff.  

And this game is all about aesthetics.  Otherwise, why bother with all those pretty minis in the first place?  

Logically, that means that you don't get enough usable genestealers with this game, since so many of them are in "static" poses.  

I'm also unhappy with the marines who have ambiguous facing or are doing something that they wouldn't be doing while moving around the Space Hulk, like tearing up the floor or displaying a genestealer trophy.  

The gameplay is still great, even if Suicide Mission is broken, but I now think of this edition as the second-worst looking edition, with only first edition looking worse.  

2nd edition with the pewter termies for the aesthetic win!

This game has all the elements I like from gaming:  miniatures, great components, combat, great story telling, and just all around fun.  Coming from a miniature wargaming backround I love assembling and painting minis.  Since time is in short supply these days, I don't have the ability to paint whole armies anymore.  This game scratches my mini gaming itch as well as my love for boardgames.  Great fun!!

Use to be a 10 for me but I really miss the variety and versatility that the original games expansions gave through adding the Hybrids and things such as that.

If that ever happens I'll be the first to load up on everything space hulk as its the original highly asymmetric tactical conflict game.  I equally enjoy playing both sides in this one and its highly balanced once players learn the basic strategies.

El hecho de que a sus compradores nos parezca "una ganga" el haberlo comprado por ¡¡78€!! puede ayudar a hacerse una idea de la extraordinaria calidad de sus componentes: las piezas del tablero absolutamente distintas unas de otras, con efectos de relieve e impresas en un cartón más grueso que mi barriga, los dados marmóreos, las puertas, los counters... y, señores, hasta 38 miniaturas que honran los mejores trabajos de Games-Workshop.

El juego es trepidante y no da respiro (sobre todo al jugador que lleva a los Marines) y transmite ese aroma a Alien que ningún aficionado a la ci-fi dejará de apreciar.

This game is really interesting.  I don't tend to like "dice-heavy" games, where your fate can turn on the luck of the die very easily.  But Space Hulk is an exception -- it's dripping in theme, and when I glare over the board at my steely-eyed opponent, daring him to step out into the corridor so I can overwatch that sonuvabitch, it's fun.  It's not a game you should play if you:
1) Can't stand your plans blowing up in your face.
2) Dislike playing as both "good guys" and "bad guys".
3) Think theme is unimportant.
4) Get pouty if you don't win all the time.  You won't always win this one.  Get used to it.

That said, it's REAL fun, and scratches a particular itch.  And you can bond with a male buddy over this shit so easily, it will remind you of why you play games in the first place.  FUN.

I always want to play it.  Will this never change?  I don't know yet.  Ask me in another 20 plays or so...

Unprecedented lavishness in components.  The game components are in fact the best that I have ever seen and I have seen many, many games.  The unprecedented production values mean that this has to be a 10 and yes there are $100 worth of game components in the box.  Another Halliwell gem, thank you sir.

Great tactical game with a wonderful atmosphere. There is a lot of pressure when playing the marines side using the timer cause you don't know how many aliens are rushing towards you.

Brilliant components in this 3rd edition and the fact that you have everything you need in one box increase the score from 1st edition. Still not sure if I´ll play 1st or 3rd edition rules though.

RATING: 9
Does a great job of adding tension to the space marine turns... all around an incredible and fast paced game.  And if you dig models, the ones in here are legendary.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great tension: Timer.  Deadly attacks.  The mission has to be completed (clear goal).  The time pressure is great; optimizing moves is important (the action points must not be wasted).  Luck plays a role: always hoping for the best…

Nice variety: 12 missions, 2 sides, a few different strategies for each mission.  Space Marines have different capacities.  Genestealers come randomly in bunches of 1 to 3.  The luck plays a role (dice), which modifies the way each game is played.

Nice narrative: Scenes from a movie.  Desperate acts.

I love RftG, especially with 2 people, because there is always a lot to think about: the game keeps me very busy; this immerses me in a world which offers a nice break from the rest of the day.  Now, SH excels at keeping the players immersed in the game, thanks to the timer and the models.  In SH, one does not need to think as deeply as in RftG, but, similarly, one thinks almost all the time.  Both games do require concentration and reward with a specific experience that nothing replaces for me.

Great game, among the games for 2.  A relatively similar game would be Commands & Colors: Ancients: not too long, for 2, with head-to-head fights with dice.  Playing Genestealers give me a feeling similar to ordering soldiers in CCA: your only chance to win is to go for hand-to-hand combat, but, on the other hand, doing so also augments your chances of dying.

Relatively short playing time: about 60 minutes, including setup and tear down.  This is better than C&C:A.

* Maybe to add to review: *
Nice spiral of death: fewer marines means faster turns.  You have more time to think about your moves, if there is hope; the game can end faster, if there is little hope.

Can take a lot of table space!  A nice, long dining table is useful.

Balancing mechanism: Space Marines killed => more time for each one.

Very thematic.  This is one of the few games for which I would consider variants; for instance, a scenario might give additional powers to a Space Marine, and this would easily be implemented by giving him a dice modifier.

One minor quibble: Sergeant Gideon dies quite easily (see statistics thread), but he's supposed to have survived hundreds of combats…  I guess the missions in Space Hulk are tough…

On a similar note: thanks to the strong theme, you can play intuitively and intelligently at the same time: in order to learn the rules, it almost suffices to know what you want to do ("I want to quickly turn around in order to face my enemy and shoot at the Genestealer"), then what you can do ("Then you must first turn 90 degrees…"), and only then how to do it ("… and it costs you 1 Action Point").  My 8-year old can play without any problem, and he creates situations that could easily make for nice action scenes in a movie.  I even found out that playing a first game while leaving out the timer can be a disaster, if the Space Marine player indulges in so much thinking that his turn take forever ("Oh no, I did not want to do this: it's not optimal.  Can I put all my Space Marines where they were at the beginning of my turn?").
This kills the ambiance, and a good part of the pleasure that the game has to offer.

The rules are quite simple and follow the theme closely, which makes them easy to remember.  However, I had missed a few points, that I only noticed after a few games (and thanks to BGG).  For instance, I had forgotten that only a SM that witnesses an Action can use Command Points during the Genestealers phase (which speeds up and simplifies the game, as there are fewer possible SM Action during the GS turn—on the other hand, the SM player can get bored while waiting for the GS player, if he's done thinking about his next moves).

My wife, with 2 games behind her, did not like it.  Granted, she said, there is a real challenge in playing the SM.  However, it's only guys killing other guys in bloody fights.  That's the kind of things that turn her off from Awakening the Bear as well…  Note that she's very opened to any theme, usually (she loves RftG, which is also sci-fi).

Cost: reasonable, for what one gets.  Worth 2 40 € games.

Negative points:
Scenario 2 can lead to a situation where the Marines just open up a long alley and wait for Genestealers to come (but maybe only if the GS player lets this happen??).

This is my favorite adversarial game, due in large part to its emphasis on cutting down game mechanics to meaningful decisions and its implementation of geometries of fire.  The theme is a nice Aliens variant, and apart from minor problems like a scenario occasionally feeling like it's become "the game of count to six" during the genestealer turn, I can't imagine it being much better.

Have a few games under my belt since receiving this game over Christmas.  It's a great game - regardless of actions taken by the publisher.  I had no issues with broken models, no problems removing models from sprues, no bloody fingers from Genestealer claws.  I have experienced warping of boards since opening the box a month ago; will try to straighten with heavy books and report back.  Otherwise, quality of components is excellent.  Relatively uncomplicated rules which allow for greater depth of play than one would first expect.  Just great stuff.

[size=18][b]Best of 2009[/b][/size]

A combined 18 hours later, this was finally assembled by me and my friend.

Frankly, I'd be hard pressed to find a more tightly designed tactical combat game.  Space Hulk strips it down to the bare bones of what is needed.  The theme comes across in full force, but the actual rules need only five minutes of explanation.  The asymmetry between Marines and Genestealers is one of the most delicate balances in all gaming: the individual scenarios can throw it one way or the other, but anyone can win.  Hands down the prettiest game in my collection, and the game I'm most likely to show off.

(If you can't get this, Death Angel is pretty good as well.)

I own this.  I feel like I got ripped off.  

When the game initially lauched it was pretty cool, but board games have moved on from those days and sadly the re-boot of this game did not.  From the nostalgia perspective the game is what it is ... but it just does not stand the test of time. 

Yes the fanboy in me says oh goodie pretty minis.  The value in this box is not there and what GW did by limiting the production and then clearly making more and giving them out like candie to favored game stores is just obscene.  Its a one sided game and for the money many third party companies have produced tile sets and blip markers ... go with those ... the rules are all over the place really cheap ... get some terminator and genesteler models get the tiles and the blips.  Ya you'll probably spend an extra 20 or 30 over the original 100 price but in the end you'll have a higher quality set by far.

Space Hulk is very old game rereleased with new miniatures, board tiles and rules. 

The original game (fist and second editions) where, as most Games Workshop games, a gateway to buying more miniatures. Third edition (and fourth, which differs only slightly) seem to abandon that idea giving as custom miniatures without Warhammer 40k system bases and much easier miniature assembly. It is actually a complete board game. 

In it you follow a group of Space Marines entering a Space Hulk - a mass of debris, some thousand years old, floating in space. Of course it is not empty. There are many hazards, of which the biggest are Genestealers - alien like creatures with sharp teeth and claws and six limbs. It is no coincidence that the movie Aliens came out a few years before the game was released. The game evokes the feel of the movies where our heroes walk around dark corridors, one-man-wide and will shoot continuously at the monsters. Only the monsters don't ever die, there is endless supply (limited only by your imagination and the number of models in the box. To Add to this the marines have limited time on their turn (3 minutes) counted by an hourglass. The marines often get overrun and it is a challenge for a marine player. 

The board consist of interlocking tiles made of thick cardboard. The missions feature a map how to set up the board, background story and some special rules. You get about 10 missions in basic game, which is plenty. 

The miniatures, the artwork, the board and everything feels amazing. The rules are easy to follow and are not very deep but are enough for most gamers to keep interest. 

So, is there anything wrong with this game? Little things
- The maps are premade, nothing really surprises you
- Playing on Genestealers side is boring: almost all models are the same (only a single Broodlord has different rules) and almost every mission is the same. 
- Once you figure out the pattern every mission might be a breeze. Later missions add special characters and different objectives to counter this. It will still take a good 20 hours before you get bored 

For miniature and thematic game lovers I would highly recommend it. For average gamer it is still worth. The setting might be a little too dark and grim for some, my wife can't stand it.

Polished assembly of the previous editions and expansions.
My comment is still about the same of old SH (not surprisingly), reported beklow.
As expected from GW, the components are excellent (detailed minis, evocative artwork on board sections, etc.), the price high ("hobbyist product") and the foreseeable support null.

[my comment to old SH, played 6 times]
Tactical skirmish with sci-fi theme. 
Repetitive (despite the different scenarios, it is feels quite similar each time).
It features some nice ideas and has very manageable rules.
Randomness plays a crucial role (strategy is not irrelevenat, but it is secondary to rolling well the dice).

Played it a couple of times now and I have to say...WOW! I am a warhammer 40k player, so there is perhaps more of a silver lining for me. But even so, this game has a lot of elements involved that are distiller down to simple mechanics with great results. The rulebook could probably address more situations/be generally laid out a little better, but many questions have been addressed here or elsewhere on the Internet, and the scenarios rock. Haven't tried the random scenario generator yet, but I don't doubt it's fine as the rest of the game has yet to let me down. The tryanids are instinctive yet powerful and the space marines need to be savvy and bold. I look forward to near endless replay value, and it scales up to 3 or 4 players well

From the depths of space an ancient vessel drifts slowly towards the Imperium of Mankind - a space hulk. Within its confines, untold thousands of Genestealers slowly emerge from hibernation. The Space Marines must enter the cramped corridors and tomb-like chambers of the ancient ship to defeat this alien menace.
Space Hulk is a board game for two players, recreating the battles fought between the Space Marines and Genestealers. One player commands the Space Marines as they carry out deadly missions in the ancient Space Hulk, and the other commands the horde of Genestealers opposing them. Space Hulk's fast-paced rules simulate the tense atmosphere of a mission deep inside the cramped confines of a derelict space hulk, where split-second decisions are needed for victory.

Love the game. I removed my rating because of GW's stupid move against its custormers. But then I realized the game is just the game, and GW being abusive to their customers has nothing to do with this great design that has stood the test of time.

Anyway, I did lower it a bit because I'm not so enthusiastic about the game as when it was released. I still love it but there are games I enjoy more. Still it is a great game that would deserve to be in print. It's a shame GW decided to make this a limited edition.

I have long been a GW nut. Heck I was even crazy enough to be an outrider for a bit. Space Hulk took all the goodness of the 40k universe and put it into a fun and very playable game, full of the 40k flavor with half the fat. $100 is steep for a board game but it is a bargain for Games Workshop, and this printing of Space Hulk is heads above the earlier editions in terms of production value. If you have the cash to spare I strongly suggest buying this game.

9/09: I first wanted to own Space Hulk back in 1989, but I couldn't afford it and didn't think I could do justice to the minis in any case (I was 12). In college, I could have afforded it, but again: the minis.

Twenty years later, no force on earth would keep me from owning this game. It's fired my imagination for two decades.

Space Hulk looks as pretty as its price tag suggests -- it's easily the most sumptuously produced board game I've ever seen, the bits:cost and production value:cost ratios are phenomenal.

Punching out the rooms and corridors, I realized that not only are they twice as thick as the cardboard bits I'm used to (in addition to being glossy and gorgeous), but they have RELIEF elements. It's an amazing little detail.

I can't wait to get the minis de-sprued, glued, dip-painted, and into action.

---

11/11: My genestealers have all been painted and dipped, but they look like a drybrush before the matte coat would really make them shine. Then it's on to the marines.

---

2017: I got my marines about 40% painted three or four years ago, but eight years after buying the game it's still not ready to play. I suspect when, in another decade or so, I eventually paint the minis and play it, that it'll be worth it -- but on balance, man do I wish it just came with prepainted minis.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I liked this more than I expected.  I was biased by the apparent simplicity of the game and by a general dislike of Games Workshop.  What I instead found was a thematic, relatively well balanced game.  It wasn't perfectly balanced (the scenario that I played ended up in a Mexican standoff siutation), but it was pretty good.  Best part were the stories that you can't help but come up with when player.  (ex. in my case it was Chain Fistio who single handedly killed 24 Genestealers against all odds; everybody remembers him)

A streamlined re-release of the 1989 classic. Not a single one of the rules changes upsets me - several of them improve on what came before. The gameplay is just as tense and atmospheric as ever. The highest production values of any game I've ever seen are just the icing on an already amazing cake!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First thing you notice is the production quality. That really adds to the cool factor, and the miniatures are awesomely detailed. I enjoyed the simple mechanics and the small hallways that are only one person wide. I thought that allowing the space marine's gun to jam upon rolling doubles was an exciting detail, which i haven't seen in other games. Feels slightly more puzzly than just an all out dice fest. It's a classic and will likely never leave my collection. Not sure which i prefer yet, this or Claustrophobia. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
5 / 5 - Great

Not played this, but rating based on first edition. I like the look of some of the rule changes, but not others and of course you can use either set of rules with either edition. Be sure to check out the mission generator rules from the 1st ed Deathwing expansion if you get fed up with the 12 on offer here.

RATING: 7.5
Space Hulk has the name and the nostalgia and this is an utterly gorgeous printing of the game, but I think it's losing its crown to other games, such as Claustrophobia. The old boy still has theme in buckets though and, while it can take some time to set up and play, it still grimly holds the throne for corridor creeping.

I loved playing this solo years ago but I have not played it even once since I bought the new edition. Set up time is painful and it just doesn't have the same thrill. Either boardgames have just gotten better or my tastes have changed.

Update- I created a new take on solo play and it's really brought the game to life again. After playing the book missions again I realized the problem with the game is how huge the mission maps are and how known the layout it. With solitaire games I focus on smaller groups (3 terminators) traveling through a few sections that are revealed as you move thru them!

nightmare of creating all the pieces still awaits.  For £60 you expect the game to come ready to play.... it will look beautiful - eventually - but for a busy man, having a 30 hour investment of time and effort before playing the game is..... poor.

RATING: 8
I am a big fan of the Warhammer 40K mythos (as well as the Alien(s) movies), and all things to do with WH40K, which this game is exactly that.  I never got a chance to play the original Space Hulk release, as I got into 40k a while after it came out.

This new Space Hulk, however, looks great!  I think everybody can agree that the components are some of the best ever made for any board game.  The price is a bit steep, but it's worth it, and it's not that much more than most of the epic FFG games.

The game does take a while to setup, and clean up, but if you have the time, it's worth the investment.  There are a lot of tactical decisions to be made, by both sides, and a lot of different scenarios to try them out on.  The rules are also very easy to learn, and to utilize.  

As an added bonus, if you are a Warhamemr 40K player, you can use these models in your Tyranid, or Space Marine armies.  As these models are limited, and really gorgeous, it will make your armies really stand out!

I recommend this game to fans of Warhammer 40K, fans of sci-fi \ humans vs. aliens battles, and fans of tactical military squad based games.

Played long ago 2nd edition. If I could get a set ready to play (no painting, no mounting figures, etc), I would consider buying 3rd edition, but I just want to play, not the other elements (Yes, I used to love wizkids stuff for the ready to play figures).

Game play, is OK, but not that awesome. Too much to go on dice rolls for my taste.

Also, because it is a GW game, it makes it a much worse deal due to the horrible company that publishes it.

While I greatly enjoy playing Space Hulk, I no longer wish to contribute to the game's high ranking here on BGG. If and when GW reverses their stand, I will restore my ranking. 

Great game with a lot of tension.  What I do like most is the way the marine must rush while the Gene Stealer can casually make his play.  Definitely a great game.

Game in a Nutshell: Fast masses of aliens try to stop the powerful but clunky space marines from completing various scenarios.

Missions played: I, II

Pros: Some really brilliant strokes of genius came to the designers when making this game that set-up the mood and intensity: Overwatch, the sense of firing wildly into the darkness; timed marine turns, to simulate how quick you need to think when you have aliens barreling down on you; jammed guns, the futile desperation; and the list goes on. A big amount of replay-ability when you consider all the scenarios you and other fans can dream up. The production quality is top notch.

Cons: The publisher is a bunch of dicks. A limited print run, high price tag, cease and desist orders are all well documented gripes.  But at least they replaced the timer that arrived shattered out of the box... after about two months. Back to the game: I found the level of engagement to be unbalanced in terms of how much less interesting it is to play as the aliens. There's little emotional attachment to playing the swarm since there's a virtually endless stream of them at your disposal (lose one marine however and notice how gut-wrenched you feel). The word "robotic" comes to mind as the simplest of tactics is needed to win a fair share of the games as the aliens; saving all the interesting stuff for the Marines. Set-up is a pain.

Other: Ok, ok... so I've only played the first couple missions. I'm holding out hope that future missions will make the game more engaging for the aliens.  I don't know what could possibly do that, but time will tell. Until then, it seems the only way to make this game fun for both players is to play to games and switch roles in between. If I were to only ever play this game as the Aliens, I'd likely rate it a "4".

Best Use: A fast, furious game for two who want a little edge of your seat action.

Beautiful game with top notch miniatures and nice story, but with some glaring issues:

The board tiles become bent after a while, making it harder to fit them together. Also, the command point tokens quickly become damaged from frequent shuffling. The print is beautiful, but the cardboard isn't good enough.

Some scenarios are so easily won by the Space Marines that they can't have been playtested at all. There's especially one where the librarian can simply dash through the map, holding the genestealers back with his psychic powers, and there's absolutely nothing the genestealer player can do about it. Plain silly!

Great game! Very high quality for the most part. The action is intense and the atmosphere is perfect. It requires in-depth tactical thinking and strong management of your resources. The miniatures are good quality and could easily be substituted in a 40k game with no one the wiser, provided they were painted up right. 
The only two complaints I have are the difficulty and the setup time. The difficulty curve starts steep and quickly goes vertical. It's not unheard of for the marines to be plowing away, seconds away from winning and then be completely killed to a man in one turn. That can make a player look on the last 2 hours with some bitterness. The maps for the included scenarios are very large. Almost every one requires 95% of the tiles. Add in the table room needed for the various other parts and it becomes a game that can only be set up on the largest tables.
I love to play this game, but those two complaints are enough to make this a "special occasion" only.

Once set up, it is so much to just look at. If you can find someone at all interested in the theme, then you'll have a winner. It has seemed to work well putting new players as the genestealers since the only strategy is to overwhelm in masses. As such, a new player doesn't have to learn the intricacies of the terminator rules before play. They are usually able to pick most of them up thru 2 gameplays if you give a quick explanation throughout your turns. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Played the first scenario three times: very tactical and strategical game that requires analytical thinking for playing the space marines. Playing the genestealers is a little bit too simple. 

I see it more as a puzzle game for the space marine player, where the genestealer player tries to make the challenge as hard as possible. And for that a lot of space hulk fans will hate to play the game with me. But I dont care, I liked it, but I worry about the replayability once the puzzle is solved.

I laughed, I cried, I poo'd myself. This game is so epic that it makes me want to draw the wrath of the wife and just secretly shell out the $100 bucks for it. I won't. But I sure want to. Oh man do I want to.

Second play: Why act coy about it? This game is the shining beacon of glorious awesome, piercing through the impenetrably tenebrous vacuum of space to save us from [-]Euro crap[/-] Genestealers. This game is sickeningly intense, even against a fourteen year old opponent with no real tactical understanding. I don't care if you're tired of the hype or not. This game was a bolt gun to my f***ing brain, and I loved it. It's a 10.

Now if I could only find the $150.00 it's going to cost me to pick up a copy, damnit.

===============

Edit: I was hoping to pick this and Bloodbowl up for Xmas, but after GW yanked all the user created content from the site, I decided to hold back. I have plenty of other games I can spend my money and time on and most of them are supported well by the companies that produce them and the community here. A pity, really, but oh well.

===============

Ha, the universe laughs at me. After removing this from my wantlist, the wife decided to get it for me for Christmas. And apparently she jumped through hoops of fire to do so, so in lieu of that a boycott seems a bit silly. So darn, I guess I will have to punch it a and put it together and play it. Repeatedly. And if I also happen to enjoy it, that will have to be part of the price I will have to pay. It's hard to do the right thing.

November 2010. I have never ventured beyond the second mission, and each play was gloriously intense and frustrating. It's everything Ameritrash should be, boiled down to it's core.

At first I was sceptical about both the high price and the changes to rules of the earlier editions. However, my fears have been relieved upon getting my copy of this game.

It is produced to the highest and most beautiful quality! The tiles are textured and thicker even then FFG components, the models are detailed in the extreme (even if some are posed a little TOO dramatically for gaming with) and the rules are 1st Edition at core with enough new differences for old veterans of the series to find something fresh in the gameplay.

I use the second edition mission book as it has 18 missions instead of this version's 7.

Meh. Amazing components, but I'd pretty much rather play anything else I even sort of like. I don't know why. Set up? Return on time? Not sure. Hell, I think I'd rather play Death Angel.

My copy has about two ore three plays on it. That's probably all it's ever going to get.

Your basic tunnel slaughter without pussyfooting, meaning that one hit kills basically EVERYTHING. Cool minis and components, tactically sound.

Let's get it out of the way: Games Workshop has been disrepsecting its fans for the past few years. Yes, they're jerks. But I will not let the actions of the company dictate how I rate one of the products.

Space Hulk is a fantastic game. Its mechanics are elegently simple and easy to learn. The overall design promotes the "grim and gritty far future" of Warhammer 40,000. (The only exception to this is the sand timer. Come on, guys. Every other bit looks great and that's the best you could do for one of the most important parts of the game?) It's close to flawless but sadly seems to beg for expansions that it looks like it will never get.

I've always liked the 40k universe and didn't even know there was a old game called Space Hulk until they recently re-released it. I've played it several times and it's becoming one of my favorite games. I'm looking forward to playing more of the scenarios and to painting my minis.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Rating: 6 This isn't really my kind of game any more, although it is not the dice fest I feared - visually it is a production value overkill... but I'm not into painting minis anymore, which takes half the fun out of games like this. The effect of playing Space Hulk was much like when I dug out one of my best childhood/teenager memories, Hero Quest, just to notice that time has moved on, or rather what I look for in a boardgame has changed... SH light, testosterone-driven and quick - features I look elsewhere than boardgames for. I wouldn't mind playing it again it contains a nice tactical element to it.

The 2 is a statement for GW's "IP-protection act", which resulted in file removals of player aids and FAQs on BGG - and signals my desire never to play any GW related product.

RATING: 8.2
Well, this is a pricey game (new = 60£\80€\100$). 
GW is an obscure company: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/468467/games-workshop-and-boardgamegeek 

And I'm stupid enougth to buy this game. 
I'm still waiting for the figures I've give a friend in november to paint them, hope they come soon, so I can play Space Hulk realy atmospheric ...

Nothing matter I like SH. Its an awson game, but for all that dice rolling. They used for combats only and they are well intergrated in the gameplay. The rest is handled by actionpoints you can classify like you want. Not all missions are ballanced but this is volitional. The Space Marine player is so stressed by the sandglass... Good atmosphere realization. 8 Points for SH, 0 for the company!


For traders: I've got a shrink copy in german for trade. I like to have an edition of Axis & Allies Annivesery for example or something like that...

Space Hulk is an intuitive, elegant and engaging dungeon crawler, rich with thematic touches – particularly the alien radar blip mechanic. It's somewhat unwieldy in terms of player limits, set-up time and physical bulk, but none of these factors detract from the good time to be had. 

Exceptional!

That usually leaves the Genestealer player doing very little in the way of playing the game.

To heck with all of the critics.  This game totally lives up to the hype.  Even if you factor out the giddy teenage nostalgia it may evoke, it still has more than enough Space Marine on alien action to make a great, fast paced and exciting game.  The theme is great and the production values are outstanding.  I love it!

Even though luck dominates Space Hulk there is room for strategies and tactics. The game is light, exciting and fun even though I am not into science fiction. However, I fail to understand what people here on Geek is are raving about. This game simply lacks depth. I enjoyed the first edition of the game when I was a teenager. Now I am willing to play only if I have a pint in hand. Playtime is about an hour which is nice.

RATING: 4
Has some interesting mechanics, but I'm not a fan of this type of dice-driven combat.  Does a great job building up the ominous atmosphere, but that doesn't by itself make it a great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The claustrophobic two-player extravaganza Space Hulk was released nearly at the same time as HeroQuest and shares many of its qualities: relatively light but very entertaining, unapologetically fantasy-laden, with a strong influence of the dice, and optically very baroque (at least for its time... well, this last reissue is very baroque by any standard). In a word, GEEKY.

Space Hulk increases the amount of tactics in HeroQuest but it lacks its surprise element (dark alleys that contain lots of monsters who first show up when the heroes enter the room). Nevertheless, for both reasons Space Hulk boasts higher replayability: although the modus operandi for each mission can be slowly optimized by both players, good or bad luck mean new challenges that keep each game thrilling.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I totally suck at painting minis, so I will probably not get full "enjoyment" out of this game. In fact, because the minis are "in progress," our first few games have been with LEGO minifigs, and they do Just Fine.

Great game, and the kids really enjoy it immensely, particularly all of the dice rolling. (Why do they always roll 6's?!)

It's not right up my alley, but it is a fun time, even though I'm not sure these minis will ever get finished!

Outstanding game. Well worth the hype, which is a rare thing. Be warned: This is a Games Workshop game, which means no 'open the box and get playing' - you will have to cut the minis off the sprues at the very least. Painting them is optional.

Replayability looks to be solid, on the assumption that GW will come through with a scenario editor. If not, there's a fantastic tilesystem program available in the game forums that lets budding designers do their thing instead. One way or another, I'm certain this game will have more than 12 playable scenarios by the end of the year.

Gorgeous production, tense gameplay and tremendous fun - what's not to like?

RATING: 4
Uhh, pretty much the same as the previous editions, unless you are rating it for the components. The new dolls seem to fall over more due to the small bases and over-exaggerated poses. At £60, the game is overpriced for what you get in the box, yet comparatively cheap for a GW product. 

Overall it is on okay game, not bad but not great.

First of all, this game looks absolutely fabulous. Probably one of the best game produced. Some of the miniatures are too complex and take a bit too much space, but this is tolerable flaw.

The game is a bit luck-dependent on certain occasions, but you usually need to minimize luck factors. Still sometimes the dice just don't play along...

The rules have been simplified nicely. Gameplay is clear and fast-paced. Playing time is just perfect (about an hour). Love at first sight! Too bad that GW doesn't make these smaller games more since they definitely have the required skills. The day GW leaves WH40k and WHFB and starts to make more games like this is to be waited!

We played the second mission, seemed broken to us. There's no incentive for either player to move after most of the GS are on the board... 

Finally managed to play this! I played the genestealers, and that is not nearly as much fun as playing overlord in Descent. Figures are really too big, they interfere with the gameplay (can't put them facing in the right direction, they will cling to eachother and topple eachother when moving one). It breaks the suspension of disbelief... 

bf played. figures don't fit the squares, which is annoying.

I really love Space Hulk, honestly.  It's just a game that doesn't see a whole lot of play due to its 2 player requirement, its distinct theme, the size of the box, and the amount of setup and teardown involved.

It's a good game because it does a very distinct theme in a very distinct way, but it's not a great game because it's still just push-your-luck dice rolling like most Games Workshop products.

I do own this game, and will admit to not yet playing it, however I will not provide a numeric rating for this game (despite how much I may come to enjoy it) as I believe GW's legal department is too heavy-handed in their desire to control their IP.  This decision was not spurred on by the BGG community at large, but rather is based on GW's approach to other fan-sites that may be in a similar vein (and perhaps more focused) to BGG.  Of GW products I have purchased, these would include SHv.3, various paints, as well as the FFG distributed, 'Chaos in the Old World'.  It is extremely unlikely that they will recieve further patronage from me, and I do believe that their recent endowment of the BGG Geek award is well timed - in conjunction with their C&D order.  May I suggest that BGG enforce their right not to allow GW to advertise their recent BGG award?

OWN: 4TH EDITION (Sep 2014) [SAME AS 3RD ED. + MINOR RULES/MISSION CHANGES + 4 NEW MISSIONS (=16 TOTAL) + SOME NEW CARDBOARD TOKENS]

Original comments for 3rd Edition...

Still the classic game I remember it to be, long overdue for a re-release. Great 2 player tactical battles, plays really quickly, easy to swap sides and compete for best outcome.

Rules are pretty much taken from 1st Edition but with a large number of small tweaks and simplifications. Also includes many selected parts of the 1st Edition expansions.

Components are great. Good decision to colour the models red/blue for marines and genestealers as this allows play straight from the box without painting. Cardboard components are unbelievably thick, although the plastic coating top-layer can peel back taking the surface image with it on some of the pointy edges (notably the entry arrows).

The streamlined rules combined with the improved components definitely put this a touch above the original.

Played frequently during my youth and never got bored of it.  The timer is a must.  People say that the genestealer side could be run by a simple AI; perhaps, but there is some strategy (i.e. press your luck) involved.  The redesign was faithful to the original, and did some good rules streamlining (though not enough given the errata), but I actually prefer the old simpler minis.

What a treat for an Ameritrash-gamer. Amazing tiles and minaiture, plus exciting and thrilling scenarios that pit the crazy marines against the feverish genestealers coming from all corners. Played with the right people and atmosphere, this game would creep the shingles out of me. The rules are simple enough with a few exceptions and fiddly rules you need to remember but the flow of the game is great. The timed turn for the marines both prevents AP and makes the game more exciting. Love it, it is a shame it is so hard to track down.

A good example how GW messed up a good thing. The 3rd edition is over rated, hence my "1" rating. The game is worse than the second edition. Even with all the extra bits. I'm sticking with the 2nd edition of Space Hulk, which by the way, I rated much higher than the third edition.

I used to have a protest rating of 1 so that people looking at the 1 ratings would see a positive review and a nose-thumb at all the other anti shills.  Even a fan like myself could rate it a 1 and Space Hulk could still sit in the BGG top 10.

With the recent hullaballoo (2009-12-02) I've removed my rating to avoid confusion.

I got so wired about buying this game I bought two and not to sell either. I have no idea. Curiously I know lots of folks who have got the game and not even played it. Im doing the paint job on it currently then will give it a run.
Some of the best components I have ever seen in a game.The indented board tiles are great and the marine miniatures are strangely the best I have ever seen from Games Workshop.You know if GW actually hit this standard some of the time I might even be interested,but they dont.

An excellent update to the original. Rules are mostly derived from 1st Edition, largely ignoring the weaker 2nd and added a whole new level of production value on top.

RATING: 8
Formerly my rarest game before they reprinted what they swore blind they'd never reprint (I never believed them). Great components but it suffers horrendously for lacking even the most basic of cardboard inserts. The beautiful and solid embossed tiles also warp over time. Good fun to play but requires the right mood and proper planning to play as combined setup and play time are quite long.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Apart from getting the figures assembled and painted, I don't know how they could improve the package any more. It's an absolute labor of love and it shows in every aspect of the game.

The 3rd edition rules tweak the game to be a bit more helpful for the Space Marines, but it's still merciless as ever. Overall I'm glad you can play this pretty much with whatever edition rules since all the components are intermixable. Normally, I'm not that keen on house rules and tweaking stuff, but in this case I think it's valid.

"I think we need a bigger table..."

Great game.  Dynamic gaming experience that changes each time you play.  Space Hulk can be too random at times, but that can make the game very memorable.  Like the time when the flamer beat 3 Genestealers in hand-to-hand and completed the mission (epic).

I recently aquired a "third edition" after a 25 year long break from Space Hulk and the likes. I must say I really, really enjoyed playing it again, and with this excellent edition it can't go wrong. I've been re-discovering boardgames and have been playing some Dungeonquest, Carcassone and the good ol' Aliens but this...it's in its own league. At the moment it feels a bit unbalanced, but we just started playing really.

Dice fest, Dice fest, Dice fest. Yes, somebody like dicefest, Im little disapointed, that very nice look and atmospheric game is only about random, random and only random. You may choose tactics, but....not good dice roll, not good tactic. I give 5 - very high score, because I like Warhammer World and I spent very much time with Electronic arts PC game Warhammer. I was happy for reprint, but now, im little disapointed. No tactics, no RPG, only random dice fest. You fail mission, try it again, maybe dice rolls will be better. About nothing more is that game. 
Yes, plastic figures are amazing, cartoon mateial also, one of the best looking game, very nice design. Collect this game? Yes, play it?,....maybe.....not

ULTIMATE BOARDGAME BOY-TOY
Tactical die roller - tense with plenty of decision making.  Fabulous production value.  Need to keep the 60 second expoxy handy while assembling the space marines - several of the arm pegs snapped during assembly.  I also filed the sprue stubs off the bottom of the bases to improve stability.  I have neither the talent nor patience for painting the figures, they look quite nice without.  [1-18-2010]  First play with Young Blucher as the Space Marines.  Slaughtered many Genestealers with ranged fire, then one of the baddies got in close combat ranged and tore through three marines in a row.  Ouch!  Purchased as Christmas 2009 gift for Young - I thought I had missed out on this one as it was by all accounts SOLD OUT - I was at my FLGS getting some sleeves for my crumbling Up Front cards, just doing a little browsing - and there it was in front of my face with the standard 10% mark-down (that's right $90) - SWEET.  Of course $5 worth of sleeves turned into a $100 purchase.  Oy!]

 I played second edition tons of times, loved the game but this edition has some great improvements in game play. The timer is great as well as the Assault Cannon, Psyker, Broodlord, new flamer rules, Lightning claws, Gaurd order and command point system. The miniatures are just amazing, especially all the terminators being unique and the Genestealers have some great poses. I am almost finished painting the set and one other thing I do with my game is black line all the board sections and doors. It just looks much better that way.

A fun strategy game that pits two extremely different opponents against each other in mission scenarios.  The game is beautiful and the system is effective.

Beautiful. Such amazing work on GW part for the minis and the boards in this game. And for once the excessive price seems justified. Sadly this is the production quality ALL their games had back in the late 80's early 90's. 

This game production value may be beautiful but unfortunately it does not play quite as smoothly or as easily as some of the earlier editions. Also many extra rules, options, and variations were "slimed down" to make this big bucks version more appealing to a wider audience. Sadly that makes this the least gaming bang for your buck, no matter how many shiny plastic pieces it contains

Games Workshop, a company which spits on its fans, does not deserve to receive aid and comfort from its enemies.  This rating is solely to assist in keeping a Games Workshop game from staying in the top ten.

This 1 is my only way to wage war against GW, a company that hates it's fan base and any sort of creative output that the fan base might have. GW is a company that hates life and all of mankind.

EDIT: So, Aldie have asked that we do not use ratings to lash out against companies. However, he also says that BGG takes IP very seriously. Well. No company should lose profit, it kind of removes the purpose of the company. But what we have here is another case altogether: removing fan-made player aides and out-of-print games. I still hold THAT to be immoral and evil, no matter what rulebook you rely upon. But out of respect to Aldie, I raise the rating to 2.

22-04-2014. Rated after 2 plays. I like Spacehulk a lot. Mini's are awesome and scenario's are interesting. Game seems to favor the gene-stealers quite severely.

Game is very simple, mechanically, but the scenario's and spawns make it challenging.

Did I say it looked nice? Only downside is that I cannot paint and I am bad in gluing the mini's even. Should buy this one pre-painted or give it to someone I trust to paint..

I just had to play it because of all the hype surrounding it. I wasn't expecting anything going in. I played as the marines in the first mission and came out victorious. A lot of dice rolling and a lot of luck, but you still have a lot of decisions you have to make in order to maximize your luck. Great game. Fully lives up to the hype and then some, in my opinion. I just wish it wasn't so limited a release, so I could pick it up myself.

Edit - After a few more plays, this game isn't for me. Maybe it was the hype that built it up for me, but subsequent games have been a bit of a let down with the amount of luck involved. Still a great game, but not what I hoped it would be or what others appear to make it out to be. Glad I didn't purchase this game.

I had heard about previous editions of Space Hulk but never played neither of them. When I found out it is going to be republished I got curious and pre-ordered it.

Once I got the box and opened it, I was amazed. After couple of evenings putting all those minis together, I was irritated 'cause it really wasn't very easy for me.

But once I got to playing it, all that irritation was washed away. I was again amazed. It was so streamlined and easy. I had to order a second copy for massive Space Hulk FUN.

One thing to note is that I have only played 4-player games with 2 Genestealer-players (with 1 blib/turn each) and 2 Marine-players (with 1 squad each) and it has been great. Majority here seems to think it's even better with just two players, and I'm eagerly waiting to get to test that.

[color=#CC0000]

An exceptionally fine blend of skill and luck.  You win by pushing it.  You have to reach a bit, you have to make good decisions, and you have to have contingencies prepared for when something unexpected happens.  

Skill will pay off in this game.  It's not just "the overwatch baby" though that's a cute slogan, it's about driving into the enemy and taking control of the situation.  This game provides that opportunity, but you have to [i]take[/i] it -- it's not handed to you for free.

The game drives emotion.  You feel compelled to succeed, for no apparent reason.  The theme is this curious blend of combat and monastic tradition which almost generates its own Gregorian background music as you play.  Beautifully rendered.

Production quality is literally second to none.  I challenge you to name a game with finer components out of the box than this.

Fabulously produced game but the gameplay was just not for me. I enjoy Warhammer and thought I would like this game and while I enjoyed it, there are many things I would rather play instead.

This may be the first game I've played that can be described as "cinematic." It replicates a thrilling, intense story, and does so almost flawlessly. You'd think that such a game would require arcane rules with tons of exceptions, but you'd be wrong. It's very streamlined, and games play within an hour. Combine that with the finest components ever produced, and this game is a true classic.

*addendum* Everything about my original comment stands: Space Hulk is one of the best games I've ever played, the absolute best that Games Workshop has ever done. But it sat unplayed on my shelf for long stretches, suffering the same fate as other two-player games. However in the last year I've had the great pleasure to begin playing with my seven-year old son, who understands the feel of the game, if not the tactical nuance. It's been a huge pleasure to enjoy this game with him, and it has elevated Space Hulk even higher in my estimation.

aaargh. Want to rate low because of how much GW pisses me off--dumped my 40K stuff decades ago in a fit of pique after yet another round of price gouging, mini-disqualification-so-you-have-to-buy-the-new-stuff and rules dumb-down, so I'm not primed to like any of their crap...

but this one remains in my collection. played on and off for the last 25 years. it's solid, the timer for the marines is genius, it remains the standard for one-on-one thematic beatdowns. fun exciting dice drama at its best.

3e is a great edition. Can't imagine what 4e could do to improve on it. more missions maybe? Don't know, probably won't find out, this edition is fine.

First played Space Hulk when it first came out at a GW Gamesday MANY years ago. Played the 3rd edition recently and (apart from tweaked overwatch & sustained fire rules) was pretty much exactly the same experience from all those years ago.

So it's stood the test of time, as in still being somewhat fun to play, but my tastes have really moved on. The main emotion I feel while playing is frustration. As the genestealer you spend the whole time "charging" down corridors at marines on overwatch, which is more like you move 1 square and they roll dice at you...if they miss you move another square and they roll dice again; repeat till you get shot. 
There are some tactical/strategical options in the game (deployment and use of blips, order of your marines in corridors etc), but everywhere the game should be interesting (like whenever the genestealers and marines get anywhere near each other), it’s just a load of dice-rolling. Summary review?

"OK, but I can easily go my whole life without ever playing again."

RATING: 7
Hybrid set - 3rd edition box, chits and board pieces, 2nd edition genestealers, and a mix of c. 1993 marines and terminators. 

Maybe I'm biased owing to having had to make do, but I believe I vastly prefer the earlier minis because I don't really go for diorama poses on game pieces. 

Considering buying more board sections as they seem to be the cheapest component to turn up on ebay, with the most potential usefulness.

Hugely impressed by the quality of the board components. I never played the original: I imagine it was way out of my price range the first time around. I recall being deeply unimpressed by Citadel's early plastic miniatures, considering them a rip-off - not too sure now, as I generally find them much easier to paint (although they are undoubtedly a trifle light and brittle).

Everything I would want 40k to be - fast, simple and entertaining. Expecting that this one will see a lot of play over the years.

Looks absolutely fantastic. Tension and theme are all in the mix. This has been a classic for 20 years and will continue to be so for the next decades. If you did not have the time to buy a copy do it, do it now! You can always sell for double price, if you don't like it.

So far I have not liked this game as much as I expected.  I like the Sci Fi theme and the components are fabulous.  I usually like tactical games, even light ones.  But for some reason the the options in SH seem just too limited.  By way of comparison, on the PSP I have extensively played and enjoyed Squad Command, which is turn-based W40k squad game.  There was a more to it.  There were more options for movement and positioning due to the different board layout, which usually involved a war-torn city or something similar.  The design of the Space Hulk with single file corridors really hampers positioning options.  I know some people like the challenge of working in those confines, but to me it just reduces the number of options and drains interest. Also, in the PSP game each unit got a large pool of action points he could divide among movement, making multiple attacks, improving the accuracy of attacks, and the like.  Managing and conserving those points was a lot more interesting than the options I find in Space Hulk.  The choices in SH seem pretty limited, although I may be missing something.  Strangely enough, even a simple game like Ninja vs. Ninja seems to have more tactical options.  I need to try some of the later scenarios that use the Broodlord, psychic powers, etc.  That might increase the level of interest.

I can't get enough of this game - it's insanely addicting.  It's obvious why this game has stood the test of time - it's rich, full of theme and tension, has deceptively simple rules but rewards smart play and harshly punishes any mistakes.  And you can play it in an hour and set it back up for more.  Worth every penny of the admittedly hefty price tag.

I've never really gotten into GW games, but I really enjoyed playing this one with my friends as a kid. I almost bought the re-release at a game store and found, when I went back to get it, that it was sold and out of stock. Pity.

Fortunately, I found it on BGG, and I now own a copy I can mess around with. The game mechanics are as good as I remember, and the third edition is beautiful. I just wish the pieces were better suited to the board; when you get 15 genestealers in a tiny corridor, you can run out of room, FAST. It's also difficult to tell where a couple of the Space Marines are facing sometimes because they are holding their guns in one direction and looking in another.

Still, this is a great game with a modular board and really refined mechanics. It's probably my favorite of the GW titles.

RATING: 8
Only played the Suicide mission so far. Tense and provides ample strategic considerations with minimal exceptions, without going into tedious bullshit 'flavor rules' like most wargames do. Conflict of Heroes is a very similar game, but lacks the production quality and is unnecessarily complicated.

Not too high on this yet but that might change after I try the other scenarios. It's boring being the Genestealer player in the Suicide mission.

For $100+, I sure wish the figurines could have come ready-made, or at least have a manual on how to cut and assemble them correctly. I screwed a few pieces up, and this often seriously hampers my willingness to play this. The chunky cardboard bits are beautiful, but the glossy cover looks in danger of peeling sometimes. And I dread opening the box to one day find warped tiles.

[hr]

Finally tried another Scenario (3: The Rescue), and BOY THAT WAS INTENSE. I could practically hear the alien screams and the firefights in the corridors. Confirmed my suspicion that this boils down the hex-and-counter wargame to its bare essentials, and keeps it fast and furious like it should be.

Genestealer strategy was much more interesting, mostly in terms of where to place Blips. Also how to set 'free-involuntary-Reveal' traps, and where would you like to cause a potential jam first. Even if it doesn't improve, screw it: this game is all about switching sides and taking turns to give your friend a shit-in-pants-awesome experience. AI in board games didn't really exist back then, and it is always 'buggy' in modern board games anyway.

4+4. Taking the 1 point off design since Genestealers still suck, just not as much.

3rd edition has been my introduction to Space Hulk and I'm duly impressed.  The presentation and component quality of this game are outstanding - as well they should be, given the price-tag.  Having a scenario set-up on your dining room table, in all its glory, is a thing to behold.

The rules regarding tactical combat are solid and provide a numerous interesting decisions.  But most impressively, Space Hulk provides a great sense of tension throughout the game.  Rolling a series of overwatch attacks on an approaching Genestealer is absolutely thrilling.

Too bad GW doesn't trust its fanbase, but their behavior doesn't affect my feelings towards this game.

I had previously rated this an 8, but in protest of GW's recent cease and desist letter to BGG, I am un-rating the game.  I was in the midst of painting my minis, and have suddenly lost all appetite to play the game, or any other official GW game.  Off to play their also-banned, fan-maintained, NetEpic.  If GW doesn't want to support their fans, I see no reason for BGG users to give them free advertising and product support.

*as a side-note, I have never before entered a "political" vote, and hope never to do so again.

For me, this is the definitive edition of Space Hulk.  The miniatures in this game are some of the finest I own (I have hundreds of GW miniatures across all of their game lines) and they are very evocative of the theme.  The cardboard tiles are, hands down, the best of the three editions of this game (although I don't like how each door has a different design or color - I prefer the uniformity of the matching doors in the other editions).  The only real disappointment in the box is the cheap plastic timer that comes with the game.  A great game whose components I hope stand the test of time as well as my 1st edition copy has, because I'm sure to be playing this game for the next 20+ years too.

When this game was released, I did not have the money to get it.  But about a month after, I had the money and they were already sold out.  I found a game store online that had a copy and bought it.  (I think I paid about $50 more for it).  When it finally arrived, the box had been crushed in the shipping.  I was very upset as you can imagine.  A few of the minis had parts broken off, but nothing too extreme.  In fact I have glued them back together and they were all clean snaps so you can't even tell.  The other thing however, I couldn't fix.  The timer had broke too so there was sand all over the box.  All of my beautiful tiles from space hulk have tiny scratches all over them.  Not too noticeable unless you look closely. It still upsets me greatly though cause 1) I do my best to keep all of my games looking as pristine as possible.  and 2)  I paid a lot of money for that.

RATING: 8.5
Price is overinflated for the Australian market (US$99 = AU$120 NOT AU$165). But it's heavy (4kg) and looks fantastic.

Game looks fab (imagine the amount of tree killed in the making of those THICK tiles). Game is a Euro dungeoncrawl. The marine player has a three-minute time limit to move his squad. 

All actions are AP driven and the Marine player has Command Points (as seen in games such as Conflict of Heroes) to do extra actions or react on the Genesteelers turn. Lots of tension and good all round fun. Easy to teach, easy to pick up and play.

Great miniature sculpts...but the damn things are too fragile to get off the sprues. Expect to take hours to get the game ready to play (and that's even before painting!).

Looking forward to more missions.

Outstanding components. This game won't get played anytime soon, because I'm painting slowly painting the figures. I've never painted miniatures before, so I practiced on some plastic Zombies!!! first. So far, I have just primed my Space Hulk figures and nearly finished painting the door stands and bases.

Update 11/30/09: I haven't finished painting my figures yet, but I have now played several games of Space Hulk. It's a great game with clear rules, exciting gameplay, and outstanding components.

The Emperors new clothes look better than ever. Yes, the components are top class, the board pieces stunning., the space marines beautiful.. some of the stealers look a bit funny, but then again cannon fodder is cannon fodder.

The small changes to the 1e rules don't bother me. GW has left them mostly as they were. Some old farts complain, but some always do (often I'm one of them). If GW would produce more products of this quality I'd gladly purchase them. I guess this was a rare treat and now it's back to the umpteenth edition of 40k.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Initial rating based on 6 quick plays of the Suicide Mission. Space Hulk is the best tactical, squad-based combat board game I have every played. (That isn't to say that you can throw a long term strategy out the window - you cannot. But tactical chops will determine the victor.) After I got my copy, I discovered all this stink about the poor business practices of the publisher. But my rating does not reflect my opinion of the publisher, or the private habits of the game designer, or anything of that sort. The game itself is at least an 8 for me, I expect the rating may even rise.

Update: more plays sees this rise to a solid 9 for me. Some reviewers comment that this game is "good for being an older game". Wha?? It's a good game. Period. It does not feel clunky or outdated to me. It's just an excellent implementation of tactical, squad-based combat. The rules are easy enough to teach just about anybody and not too complicated to recall between long breaks away from the game. I'm sure there are deeper games of this sort on the wargamer's chest, but delving into serious wargames is a commitment for which I lack the time and interest (at this time). So Space Hulk is perfect. Each game is tense and exciting, and I especially enjoy the asymmetry of the Genestealers vs. the Space Marines. Example: The Space Marines have to use a timer to limit their turn, whereas the aliens get all the time they want. This is a fantastic way to represent the fact that the aliens are really, really fast AND perhaps have some sort of telepathy thang going on. The Space Marines excel at ranged combat. The Genestealers have none, so must close to hand-to-hand to win.

I also like the balance of brains and luck. It seems just right for these kinds of conflicts. I look forward to many more plays.

Really cool game, and cool atmosphere...

Some unique thematic elements, especially the sand timer on the Marines.

Ignoring the cinematic feel of the game, the gameplay feels a bit less robust than other similar games. 

By Scenario 3 or so it gets better though.

It's too bad that playing as the Genestealers really is kinda boring in most missions.

Awesome fun. Played this as a couple of guys bought it from our LGS. The minis are incredible for plastic ones, not that I know much that what can and can't be achieved with plastic as the material. Gameplay is fairly simple, but the plethora of different missions and the prospect of custom missions/mission generators ensures a longevity for the game. Also that it probably is compatible with some of the original Space Hulk's missions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Really nice components and fast, simple gameplay. But the game is extremely luck-dependent, with victory or defeat often determined by the command point draws of the Space Marine player. Also, the pieces are too big for their squares most of the time, resulting in figures catching on each other and knocking each other down, which kind of ruins the effect.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I finally played my copy and I have to say that it was fun but I was a bit underwhelmed. I knew the Genestealers have fewer decisions to make, but they seem to have even fewer than in a game like The Awful Green Things. However, having said that, it was still fun to see my horde of Genestealers rush the Terminators, hoping for a jam. In the end, there are plenty of scenarios to try out and I'm hoping they increase the choices for the big bad blue guys.

Played the computer version of SH, many many years ago.  Back in the days when computers were slooooooow.  The old PC version of SH was great.  Highly atmospheric and downright tense.  Had my eye on this game since it come out but was refusing to buy it because of GW's arrogance.  However, my rage has eased off and I have picked up a copy. The components in this game are the best I have seen. 

[b]This game is tense and atmospheric,[/b] especially when played with the downloadable "Deep Space Assault Console" by Beasts of War Ltd.  Immerse the game in some wicked sound effects playable from a computer and ipod hooked up to your speakers and you have probably the most atmospheric boardgaming experience possible.

There are three downsides to the game:

1.  Assembling the figures takes some time.
2.  Playing the gene stealers is nowhere near as exciting or as interesting as playing the space marines.
3.  And lastly the major downside is Games Workshop. They are corporate bullies and it leaves a sour taste in my mouth.

I feel the same way about this as Warhammer Quest.  It seems they are pretty similar or even the same systems, a very bare bones dungeon crawl adventure game.

I like richer experiences and this is a bit too simple for my tastes, especially compared to something like Descent which is not really any less accessible but offers a fuller experience.

This certainly isn't an awful game, just completely outshined.

A classic. Played over and over again. The best, that GW has ever made! No other game can be played this intuitively. I own the first edition which I played very many times in the past 20 years, but this one here is high end, an artwork! Wonderful minis and the fact that the designers understood, that you do not have to play against an overly complicated rulebook to create an intelligent game, make this my all time favourite. The game is very well balanced- there is not too much and not too little. As I said in my comment on the original game: Every rip off that´s been published in the last years may have introduced some little "improvements" (battle cards, mutation and so on),claiming to be better than the original. Truth is: None of them was able to bring a package that transports this feeling of completeness as Space Hulk does. Thank you GW for this wonderful masterpiece!!!

La nota es una protesta por la política de GW, pero después de haberlo jugado, le pongo un 4. Es bastante aburrido.

Space Hulk is a classic game, which I remember playing as a child. When the new edition was released, I knew I had to get it.

I carefully put the miniatures together, and played some games. It's fun, no doubting that. There are a few different missions too, which gives plenty of replay value.

But now, I rarely get it out. The problem is ... the miniatures are too good for a board game. You don't want to just chuck them all in a box and take it with you to your local gaming group. It feels like something you need to be very careful with, and that gets in the way of it being a good game.

Also, because it's only 2 player, it limits the number of situations it can be played in.

I'm glad I have it. Every now and then I'll get it out, look at all the parts lovingly, then put it back away. As a beautiful artefact, it's a success. As a game you'll be playing all the time, it's not.

RATING: 9
This is a great game. The pieces are so beautiful. The rules very well written. It's got a fun theme to it that draws you in and invites lots of fun trash-talk at the table. It's fast-playing. It's easy to play, easy to teach and easy to learn. The strategies are clear enough for a kid to pick up, but interesting enough to engage adults. And it is extremely fun.

I rated it medium-heavy Game-play Weight not for the actual weight of game-play per se, but for the commitment in parts-assembly when you purchase this game. It doesn't exactly require advanced modeling skills, but it does require some careful cutting to get the parts off the plastic sprues without breaking them (if you don't own a pair of modeling clippers or at least some small wire-cutting dikes, you will need to buy some), and most of the miniature pieces need to be assembled before play. I noticed that some of the pegs are very tight fits to the mating holes in the Space Marines' shoulder joints especially. It is easy to break the pegs off, but if you file the pegs down with an exacto knife or model file, they fit easier. Use the photos of the models on the back of the mission book as a guide to how they should be posed, because it's confusing how some of the arms are supposed to go on in a few cases. It is recommended to fix them together with plastic cement or super-glue, for enhanced durability. 

After spending this much money and time on them, it almost seems like a waste not to go all in and paint them too. In the forums here there are some tutorials on how to get very impressive-looking results with only a few colors of paint and very little investment of time. Check them out!

The jury i still out on the rating. Only played first mission (3 times). It is looking pretty good (much to my surprise actually), and seems to have a surprising tactical/strategic depth. I think many different kinds of gamers will like this game.

 The game components are absolutely gorgeous. 

The Rulebook is terribly non-rigorous - awaiting FAQ!! (And as it turns out the FAQ isn't too rigorous either, and has an absolutely silly answer to LOS. 

1st ed. to the contrary seem much better written, exposed, and thought through. 3rd ed. has some good ideas though...

I would say it is a very good game. Best if mix up 3rd and 1st edition. 3rd edition alone is deeply flawed.

What a boring dice-fest! For a two-player game, too much luck is involved. For a simple game of chance, play time is too long. Action points and eye candy (read: miniatures) do not compensate for these weaknesses. Not my cup of tea. (And yes, I did play this half a dozen times or so before reaching my verdict.)

I'm not a fan of the change to the overwatch rules and will probably continue to use the 1st ed rules in that case.  Librarian rules aren't as fiddly as the expansion rules were.  Overall a good game, but I stand by my "6"  There are other games I would much rather play.

FANTASTIC! I love this game. It drips atmosphere and is super tense for the marine player. I play it with a sound time track to make the timing easier and more intense. Definitely one of my all time favourites.

Long time ago I played Space Hulk but I still remember it as one of the best experiences I had with a board game. Love the theme, warhammer world and fraging those critters.
Unfortunately the reality is that this game is way over my budget and as GW have put a stop to producing and do a reprint of this game I wounder if I will ever get hold of a copy myself, pity.

RATING: 7.3
This reminded me of Aliens and though it is significantly prettier (the floor tiles are frankly wonderful), it has some of the same problems, plus some new ones thrown in.

The missions aren't balanced, and perhaps aren't meant to be, but it annoys me when you play a game and one side has essentially no chance of winning some missions (I'm looking at you Memoir '44 and Claustrophobia). Also, how is it you can publish a game where the player pieces (the genestealers) don't fit on the board - when you have a group of them, you have to position/stagger them oddly so they'll fit - this in a game where the direction pieces are facing matters?! Also, scenarios that can result in stalemates (mission 2) - not a good thing.

The rule book is typically for GW, useless and seems to be more for selling paint than for teaching you how to play a game.

Ultimately, it was fun and I'm happy to have played it, but I'd much rather play Claustrophobia any time.

RATING: 5
This game was a complete and total surprise to me.  I didn't expect that I would like it.  It never seemed like it would be my kind of game.  I tried Warhammer once and hated it.

But Space Hulk is different.  First, it doesn't have the tape measure movement (Which I hate).  You move on squares, like a real boardgame. 

Second, it's not a big rolling dicefest.  Sure, there are some dice in it, and there is some luck involved.  But it's really more about tactics, and positioning troops, etc.

Lastly, it doesn't take 6 hours to play.  You can play in about an hour or so.  Some of the bigger scenarios take a little longer of course, but really it's not bad even then.

It loses points in that I don't believe each scenario is perfectly balanced.  But it can be remedied much like Memoir or something by switching sides.  Also, playing the stealers doesn't seem to be quite as fun as playing the Marines.

UPDATE: I still feel the same way about this game, however, I can not support a company that doesn't support its customers.  So I am putting in a 1 rating.  If GW reconsiders its policies toward it's consumers, I'll move my rating back to the 7 it was at prior to this.

Components are amazing value. Minis of Space Marines and Genestealers are probably the best game pieces in any game. Board sections likewise - gloss finish, heavy cardstock, embossed, almost each piece has different artwork. Gameplay is fun but can lack variety after some time. Be warned the minis come on sprues and take quite a lot of work to assemble (though they snap together without glue).

This is a really pretty 2 player sci-fi dungeon crawler.  All of the components are stunning, from the board tiles to the miniatures.  The mechanics are pretty good too and do a great job simulating the Alien-style, almost horror atmosphere.  Sci-fi and horror aren't really my cup of tea, but I can appreciate that this is a good game.  If you like the movie Alien and haven't played this yet, you are doing yourself a disservice.

Really great board game. very challenging and lots of good re-playability for those creative enough to come up with their own scenarios. Downside is the setup time required, and the sheer table-space involved. For two players this game can seem like a fair amount of work.

one thing you absolutly can NOT beat is the price. for $99 this game is an insane steal. (5 GW terminators are $50 as is... in this game you get 12, and that doesn't even consider all the genestealers, the board sections or the wonderful game involved here!) 

The collectibility and "limited time" business is a crying shame... but for the price, this game is quite comparable to other big-box board games with similar components, and hands down better quality miniatures/pieces.

RATING: 7.75
You'll never read what I have to say about Space Hulk.  There is so much written about it that whatever I say will just be a mumble in the din.  So I guess I write my thoughts down for myself.  Very well.

Space Hulk is a bombshell.  It is everything good about games wrapped tightly in a glimmering package that will blow your head off in a second.  It is the most embarrassing game I own--because it cost over a hundred bucks.  It just looks expensive.  A person can't see it and not be floored and curious. 

Why haven't I rated it a 9, or higher?  I don't care one bit about what Games Workshop did/does.  This entry is for the game, what I think of the game, not of the company that published it.  I haven't rated it higher because I don't think that I have played it entirely correct yet.  It hasn't clicked the way I know it will--yet.  I spent 8 hours punching and cutting everything out.  

I will say I don't really care for the set-up.  It brought back memories of HeroScape, which I don't play more often simply because it does take so long to set-up.  Shame on me.  Maybe I am not a real gamer.  

But I do like Space Hulk.

This is a great edition of this game. We've played the original all these years & it's nice to see this redone. A few tweeks to the old rules, all for the better. The original was great. The original expansion, "Deathwing", worked well, but the expansion, "Genestealer", clunked a bit, & the new rules fix some of that. Great production.

RATING: 7
Holy crap, I can't believe I bought this. I thought I was done giving Games Workshop money! On the other hand, it was the last copy at my FLGS, and it had been sitting there for weeks at its retail price.  
I could turn around, sell it online, and make double what I paid for it.  

But I won't.  Because I am a BoardGameGeek, not a merchant, and I will proudly slay Genestealers by the friggin' dozen.

Except for the fact that I'm pretty terrible at this game, that is.  I don't think I've won yet.  But it's still a great game -- claustrophobic, methodical, and deeply tactical.  Playing as the Space Marines reminds me of scenes from 28 Days Later...one minute everything is just fine, then someone makes a tiny mistake, and within a minute, half your squad is dead and the rest have no chance of surviving.  It's gripping.  I look forward to actually winning the game!

EDIT: This game might be a little too unforgiving for me.  Making a mistake in this game often feels like making a mistake in a game of slow-motion Jenga.  I generally reach for Claustrophobia these days, but I also feel like I should come back to this again sometime.  And it's still gorgeous.

I love the concept and backstory of the WH40K Space Marines and the entire mileau. The game is decent but it's not quite "deep" enough to keep me really interested. Surprisingly, I'm 8-0 in plays of this, but it remains one of my non-favored games. Wierd.

RATING: 7
The beautiful components and miniatures really make this game stand out among its peers. It's gameplay is solid and simple, yet tactically interesting enough. It's a finely tuned game, stripped of all extra fluff. The decisions you have to make are straightforward, which makes the game faster to play than other games in its genre.

The included sandtimer makes the game almost too tense for the marines, and as a result my friends always want to play as the Genestealers, because they're wimps. My friends, not the Genestealers.

Update: lowered ranking from 8 to 7. The game's a bit too simple to keep me interested for a long time.

Own one eBayed set of components minus the miniatures.

Overall, I still prefer first edition, but it's all personal preference.

Like: 
Base game including minis covering various loadouts. That rocks!

Component quality: Really, the only way it could be better is if FFG produced it. GW has really outdone themselves here.

Rules: Overall, I think the rules are more balanced. Overwatch is different, but not worse. The free un-jam still hasn't proven itself as not overpowering.

Librarian: Very well incorporated, and much cleaner than the Genestealer system.


Don't like
Broodlord. I understand it's a variety thing, but I just don't like that it's there. I've always seen the stealers as a giant wave of homogeneity washing over the marines with death and woe.

Dramatic poses: some are just over the top and impede play. This is only a few models however.

Naming all the characters: Takes away some of the 'my hulk' feel, whatever of it there was. While this is ultimately easily ignored, it bothers the nerd in me a bit.

RATING: 8
Light, tactical, dice chucking for 2.  Really enjoyed my first two sessions of this game.  Caught me off guard, because its normally not what i go for.  Playing the Space Marines is way more fun than playing the Genestealers, but as long as you switch sides to balance out the fun life is good.  The minis are sweet and help you imagine you are watching a science fiction action movie, where troops are securing corridors, kicking down doors, and racing to destroy the evil enemy alien.  The genestealers slowly gain strength through numbers, and I can hear the spaceship alarm going off as the marines try running to complete their mission.  The minis are bittersweet, however.  I am not much of a bits person, so the fact that the custom pimped out minis make the game more expensive than I am willing to pay.  Therefore, this could have replaced Memoir '44 (2 player, dice chucker, scenario, switch sides), but alas I will have to daydream about playing this when Memoir comes out on the table.

This game truly transcends any euro/ameritrash labels.  Streamlined, fun, tactical, and evocative of theme.

A really good 2 player game.

I can't say it lasts after all the missions have been played twice (playing with thw two sides), as it seems that, because the set up is pre-determinated, that same strategy will work everytime, only changing the degree of success (because of the dice rolls). But I only played two scenarios without repeats - so take this a grain of salt.

RATING: 7.5
For all those who favor games with near equal or equal balance and where luck does not matter: play Go.

Good game has to have strong theme. Good game has to give chance (even minimal) when sitting in situation that one can not win. Good game should not turn boring in a half way, knowing that you will lose without any chance at all and can only hang there until game ends. Good game does not allow players to drag on infinite time to establish their actions on their turns.

I have always favored side with greater disadvantage on any game ever played, most of the cases I prefer outright desperate situations.

Why? Because of the feeling that you get when you manage to do something against overwhelming odds. If not much, at least show how one can lose with honor and with great cost to your opponent.

It is a pity that some of the scenarios are broken.

True to the hype, the game is excellent. I consider myself mainly a Eurogamer with occasional forays into these fantasy type war-games. While I cherish the elegance of Eurogames, I crave for theme that only these types of games can deliver. Fantasy Flight games typically drip with theme, but I have found them to be increasingly fiddly. Fortunately, Space Hulk has done a great job in marrying these two concepts. The rules are not terribly complex but offer enough choices for tactical maneuvering to achieve your goal. In a way, this is an abstract puzzle with multiple pieces moving in a tightly confined space. Excellent implementation of the theme and very gorgeous models. I haven't had this much fun playing a unique game in a long time. This is my third 9.5 after many many years.

This game isn't the Second Coming, but it is quite good nonetheless. I've played about half a dozen times, but only on the first mission, so my rating may yet change. But compared to other Ameritrash/crawler/sci-fi games, I'm impressed at how [i]tight[/i] the game is while still being highly thematic. There are only a handful of mechanics in the game, so I get an almost Euro-like sense of focus when thinking through my moves. It's a very different feeling than the loose, baggy rulesets you get in FFG titles. That being said, the rules [i]as printed[/i] leave a lot to be desired, as I've come to expect from GW.

This game takes a lot of flak for its high price. I was extremely skeptical of the cost before I saw it myself. But if anyone complains about the physical quality of this game, I'd lay odds that they either haven't seen it or just can't afford it, because the components are unbelievably well done. Even at $100, this is a better value for components than most games are at $50. Whether the gameplay is worth that or not is a different question, but the physical quality and attention to detail is impeccable.

The combat tactics can be a little stale: pile up aliens just out of line-of-sight, then rush in with hopefully overwhelming numbers to dismember the heavily armed space marines. If that doesn't work, repeat. But the wide variety of scenarios and vivid art design bring the brutal setting to life. A great option for 2 players that requires a lot of space, but won't take up your entire day.

Rating for the components right now.  I need to play a few more times to be able to rate the game play.  I have finished painting the figures.  Hooray!  The components are top notch.  Nice thick map sections with embossed features.  Doors that slide easily in and out of the holders and tokens both of which also made from thick stock. Good dice.  Okay sandtimer (could have used some chrome here).  The icing on the cake are the figures.  Dynamic scults begging to be painted full of eye catching details.  The bases of some of the figures are kind of odd though (very minor complaint).  Well writen rules and missions manuals with great art throughout.  Edit:  Played our first game tonight.  It was rich and thematic.  The scenario seemed pretty well balanced.  The painted minis added to the experience.  Definitely glad I bought this game!

Juego apabullante. Tengo la versión en italiano. Las miniaturas son insuperables, hasta los genestealers son enormemente variados. El escenario parece de hormigón más que de cartón por su resistencia. Es un juego adictivo y muy tenso, el factor tiempo lo hace vibrante. No os lo perdáis si podéis pagaros una copia.

Wow!  The tension of the timer, blips of an unknown number of genestealers, limited action points/command points, the claustrophobia and general ambiance of the hulk, termies that are are armed and dangerous but not terribly mobile.  Fantastic!!  I have never been a super heavy "theme" guy.  Any 'ol pasted on theme (or none at all in the case of abstracts) is fine with me so long as the game play is fun.  This game, oozes, and I mean oozes, theme, dripping with ambiance, you add that to very engaging game play and man you have the most exciting game for me in a very long time. Can't wait to get in some more plays!

This is just great game...mayby "ameritrash" at it's best were even some "designer"-game fans might enjoy it!:)
Only way to really improve this formula! (because let's face it if it was easy it had been done in this 20years)
Here's hot tip from BGG user:

"So.. let's create the Euro Hulk!

First, a re-theme is a must. Something medieval is definitely in order.

Minis can easily be replaced by wooden cubes. No prob there. Blue for the Genes.. umm.. I mean Castle Siegers, and red for the Mari.. I mean, Knights of the Round Table.

Board can stay, just castle it up a little..slap some castley interior for the big rooms and secret-passage-like torches in the corridors and you're set.

Dice..they gotta go. Sorry, no dice. But a few decks of cards with 1-6 numbers and some nice medieval pictures on them will do nicely.

Missions should be replaced by an auction mechanism where players bid on various tiles being used as well as mission objective. Special care must be taken so noone suspects even for a minute that the theme isn't pasted on.

Finally.. "Euro Hulk".. nah. I say name it "Bellum Magnificum" or something.

So..Agricola, watch out, here comes "Bellum"!"

Played twice. Need to play some more before I give it a final rating. But I can safely say this: Component-wise, the game was definately worth 100$! Still, I actually wish the game had counters instead of miniatures, as they keep falling over during play. Gameplay is fairly basic.

Hail to the Brits for creating the definitive "Ameritrash" game.  I have both the 1st and 2nd editions.  This one outshines them both.  Interestingly, I purchased this just days before GW decided to request a bunch of their intellectual property related materials be pulled from BGG.  It doesn't factor into my high  rating of this game.  This version returns the action/turn mechanisms to the timer first found in 1st edition.  The plastic sculpts are some of the best I've seen for this game and the corridor/room graphics are up to 21st century standards.  It's great to see the game republished as it's a great tactical game of desperate battle of the elite few against the endless masses of of hive minded minions.  Despite the dumb corporate decisions made by GW, this game remains a classic worth having in your collection.  As a 2-player game of combat that plays fast and furious the designer couldn't have done better.  The rules are fairly easy to pick up and there are plenty of scenarios in the box to keep you coming back for more.  If you've never had Space Hulk, this is the version to get.  If you have, you'll probably want this version as well.  Long live the Emperor.

Back when I was a child I played Space Crusade and Space Hulk and I loved it. When this third edition was announced I just had to get it - and boy is it a gorgeous game?

I'm torn between giving Space Hulk an 8 rating (as I think it deseves as a game) and a 1 rating (in protest of Games Workshop and their recent C&D bullying). Giving the game a 1 hurts the game, and the designer - neither of which did anything I am personally against here. I don't deny Games Workshop the right to protect it - I am disturbed by the way in which they have done it.

In the end I feel that the integrity of the ratings needs to be preserved but I don't feel comfortable supporting this game. I have therefore not given any rating to this game. As the saying goes... if you have nothing good to say about something, say nothing.

After wanting to play for 10 years (long story, but I'll spare you the details), and after owning 3rd Edition for almost 3 weeks (very busy, frustrating weeks in which I was not able to set up and prep for it) I was finally able to play Space Hulk!  So now I can also finally rate it after reading about it for so long.

The game is a [b]lot[/b] of fun.  I enjoy how each side has its own strengths and weaknesses.  They are very different from each other, but the balance each other out quite nicely.

Normally I dislike timers in my games.  However, like Galaxy Trucker, the timer adds a lot to the fun in Space Hulk.  It cranks up the tension and helps to make you really care whether each of your Space Marines accomplishes his tasks.

Of course this edition is a work of art.  The models are amazing.  The floor tiles are thick and each one is unique.  The manuals have a good mix of information and flavor text.  The box is good and sturdy (although you have to come up with something to protect your assembled minis from the heavy floor tiles when you put the game away).

I suspect that I'll always want to play this and always have a love for this game, and the beauty and quality of the components is just icing on the cake.  Thick, gooey, delicious icing.

But without painted models, it [b]is[/b] a little more difficult than I was expecting to see at a glance what the facing of any given Space Marine is, and sometimes it's a little tricky to get all the models set just right when there's many of them about.  (Due to the dynamic poses, they have a tendancy to get tangled up and get in each other's personal spaces.)  This is the only negative that I can think of (besides my concern that 12 missions might get old after awhile -- then again, I hope that I and other users will continue to come up with good "Mission XIII" scenarios), and I don't think that's enough to drag my 10 down to a 9.  So 10 it is.

Space Hulk is entertaining, but, the game doesn't really offer much of anything for variety for the Genestealer player. All the interesting aspects belong to the Marines (weapons, abilities). What do the Genestealers really have other than melee?

Earth Reborn blows Space Hulk out of the water in all regards. Both factions have plenty of abilities and interesting things to do. This is not the case with Space Hulk.

Soooooo much fun! The theme is absolutely wonderful, the pieces are completely gorgeous, and the gameplay is beautifully smooth.

This is the best looking board game in existence, period.  Not only that, but a track record of 20+ years tells you all you need to know about the design and gameplay.  It plays quickly, has plenty of tension, and plenty of theme.  Also, with 12 different missions there is more variety and replayability than almost anything else I can think of.  Nothing is broken here.  Is it worth $100?  Maybe it is - there's no other game that has so many pieces of this quality, and now that it's out of print, copies are selling for $200+ - so yeah, it was worth $100.

Material is very, very beautiful!! Such a heavy cardboard and finely moulded minis bring a lot of atmosphere to the game. However, ergonomics were AWOL the day the game was designed. There are no 2 minis that fit correctly in adjacent spots of the map, and it tends to be very annoying with the swarms of genestealers which move and pile in corridors...
The rules are easy to learn and the game mechanism is quite light and can be followed quickly. With dice involved luck plays a big part in the outcome of the game, but different abilities of the characters brings a bit of chrome quite enjoyable. It seems to be a game hard to beat but it offers many tactical possibilities, and so renews itself considerably.
A perfect choice for those looking for gorgeous material and the easy rules make the game in the reach of non-hardcore gamers (think spouse or children).

Note that I'm rating this 1, because of GW's move to force BGG to delete user content such as player aids and mission logs for this game. I've seen the game as high as rank 6 in the overall BGG charts, and since GW did that its dropped to 170 in the space of a week and is still falling.

Its left a sour taste about the game and while I'll still play it and I enjoy the game, I'm probably not going to be painting it now for instance. I'm not going to keep an eye out for a 2nd copy for extra models and terrain, etc.

2011 note: still have not played since the GW thing.

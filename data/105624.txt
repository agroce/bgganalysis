Not bad.  Had some very clever ideas, but it felt like there were just a few too many things going on in it.  I thought I played pretty poorly compared to my opponents and I nearly won...not necessarily a good sign.  Eye-catching production, of course.

Components are top notch. Game play is interesting too. Lots of gimmicky stuff, but together it all works.

RATING: 6
1st play: The kids were amped up when we played this so not a totally fair impression. The production quality is off the charts, but there's quite a bit of randomness. The randomness can be mitigated, but when playing with kids (which this game seems geared toward), the strategies aren't apparent. What seems to be left is a game that's too complicated for it's target audience, and not complex enough for a gamer audience. I will pick a better group for the second try.

2nd play: Played with the wife, the game is simple and the dice/wave mechanic is neat enough. It's a little too complicated for a kid's game and a little too simple for a gamer game. Not really a gateway game either, somewhere in that "next level but for young-at-heart gamer" game. Not sure I'll keep it, cause I don't need many games for that niche.

Huh. This is a weird game. It's sort of unlike anything else, really. It's set collection, I guess at the heart. Beautiful components, but the game... It doesn't feel right. I don't know how to describe it. It feels like a modern game but from another dimension where game evolution took a different turn. Can you tell I'm unsure how I feel about it?

Poseidon's Kingdom has some interesting gameplay mechanisms and requires a healthy amount of strategy. It certainly is great for family play as it is not too difficult but is still interesting and engaging. The wave is fun, the components are awesome and add to the gameplay experience.

RATING: 8
Interesting mechanics, I didn't fully get the strategy at first but half-way through the game it became apparent. 

I didn't actually learn the rules before playing, I simply picked them up during game play. I feel that if I had actually learned the rules then the strategy would have been more obvious at the beginning. 

I do feel that the instructions are somewhat lengthy so I would not try to introduce the game to non-gamers. This limits the audience of the game because due to its visual appeal, I would think it would draw in non-gamers.

I would like to play again.

Initial Impressions: This is definitely a unique game. The components are beautiful and the fish are cute. I would love to introduce it to my kids but the mechanisms may be a bit to complex for them to fully understand. Speaking of mechanisms, there are many of them in this game and once fully grasped I'm sure the game will be even more enjoyable.

Another light/middle weight Fragor Brothers game with the usual "cute" nicely produced figures and a unique dice rolling wave/crashing mechanism that I have not seen in any other game. 

The gameplay is engaging for what it is, but it is not a gamer's game although there are interesting decisions in building your reef and the actions it provides or negates. Recommended for family game nights.

Awesome components as per typical Fragor bros. production. Gameplay is simple but has some interesting mechanisms working together. At it's core, the game is about collecting and spending dice to get points, but the subtleties in how you go about that is very interesting! Plus, it has one of the coolest dice rolling components ever... the DICE WAVE!

This game gets several points for just how fantastic it looks. This is one of those games that people want to watch/play when they see it setup on the table.

While it's not super deep it offers enough challenge to make it an enjoyable experience.

RATING: 5
This is probably the weirdest-themed game I own. Of course the bits are really nice and the wave board is really fun, but in the end the game is fundamentally lacking in decisions. In fact, probably the most interesting part of the game is building your little coral reef, but even that gets kind of boring. After a while the movement around the board gets repetitive and the game lasts too long for what it is. It's fun enough, but most certainly not worth what I paid for it.

This is a lot of fun, and the bits are great.  There may be one too many mechanics here (the scoring at the end feels like it was added on hastily), but overall, it's a lot of fun and unique.

RATING: 8
When so many games seem 'more off the same', this most definitely is not. As is typical of the Lamont brothers designs, this is something a bit different with a fresh feel to it. The initial impression is very much of the fantastic components; loads of dice, the impressive wave and, of course, the very cute playing pieces - supplemented by nice chunky counters for everything else.  The game play is good too - I particularly love the way the wave breaking brings fresh food supplies for your creatures, but there are other nice touches too.  It's far from a heavy gamers' game but it gives you a number of things to think about - the competing demands of loading the wave and building your reef are well balanced, as are the need for extra movement/collection and dice when reef building - and it plays well and, I would say, about the right length for its weight.  And did I mention the presentation is lovely?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The first game seemed like an awful lot of effort just to get the thing set up, but once we got playing, the game is a pretty fun experience!

The game utilizes a pretty unique action mechanism (which was borrowed from Antics), but results in a much much lighter feeling game without the feel of very difficult decisions.

The real fun here seemed to be the theme and the whole dice wave thing, which is a novel addition to the game.  That chrome really carries the game, whereas I didn't feel like the game underneath it all was all that exciting in itself.

So, in the end, it's a bit of a weird game to rate for me.  On one hand, it was fun enough to play, but on the other hand, there was nothing really impressive about the gameplay which drags it back down a bit for me.  I kind of feel like I've experienced the novelty of the game and that it wouldn't be that exciting to play a second time.

Intriguing game. Unlike anything I have seen or played before. The theme is refreshing and the components look top notch. The gameplay is not overly difficult, although, it takes a bit to grasp the flow of the game initially and there is a good amount of interesting choices in the game. It will likely be a game with not too much replay value but it is something worth playing for a change and watching the wave of dice.

Finally got a chance to play this one at Geekway, but it was late at night in a noisy room and as the rules-reader in my group, it took awhile to slog through it all.

Would like a chance to play again sometime now that we have the flow of the game down, but for now I'm giving it a solid 7.

There is a lot going on this game - almost too many choices to keep track of. While I enjoyed it, I was a bit bothered feeling like we needed a "traffic cop" to remind us what was happening, where the shark was headed, etc.

A bit of a miss.  Cool bits, obviously.   I also liked the wave crashing gimmick, which scatters dice as fish food around the board.   The Kraken Trackin' is cobbled together and obviously was adjusted to give you free chips for "passing GO" so that the game would be shorter.   The reef-building mechanism is a neat idea, but I'm told it works better in Antics than here.   Two plays and I think I'm good with that.

1. Played the prototype. Great mix between random dice rolls and the skill to use the outcome wisely. "Reef"-mechanism similar, but easier than the "anthill" in Antics!, this is lighter, but nonetheless challenging enough and highly interactive.
2. Edit: Now played several times with final rules after having translated them. Much better than the first version! And a perfect mix of "lightness" and challenge together with the fun part (rolling the wave!).
3. Edit 2: Played the final product several times at Essen and at home. Rating increased to a 9.5 for what it wants to be

The gameplay looks really complex as you set up all the different boards, and then the tokens and then the wave itself, but honestly the gameplay is fairly straightforward, and after a turn or two fairly intuitive.

The figurines for the player pieces are excellent and the cardboard used for the chits and tokens is excellent and really thick , however they choose flimsy cardboard for the wave, making it prone to falling apart, which is a disappointment as this is the unique mechanic of this game.

The wave as a dice rolling mechanic is really interesting, if it were more sturdy I think this would be great, however since it is so flimsy we were barely tipping the damnable thing resulting in a lot of dice ending up in the same sections of the board. 

The coral reef mechanic is really interesting and I have not encountered many mechanics like it. There is a lot of scope for different styles of play simple from this one mechanic. 

Unfortunately there is a very simple I have more dice in play therefore I win more mechanic, which is slightly disappointing. More dice means opponents take them which pushes your piece around the board thus allowing you a 'free' rescue of a friend, more dice also mean greater bonuses once the wave crashes as this is based upon the number of shown pips.

I also feel there is very little you can do to stop an opponent who manages to rescue all 6 friends thus triggering the end game.

This game looks absolutely great! Just one look at the characters and I begin to smile!

But a good looking game nisn't always a good game.

Poseidon's Kingdom is a nice game. It introduces the big wave, which is used to roll the dice. Pushing over the big wave is great but it's also the reason that luck plays a big roll in this game. 

Nevertheless I enjoy playing this game. It's reasonably easy to play, doesn't take very long and looks great :-)

Lavish production and cute figures, as to be expected, but the game itself is rather lacking. Players place and roll dice in order to collect sets of items. As you race against your opponents, you must also stay away from the shark.

The game could be a lot better if it could be simplified. There just seemed to be far too many things going on for what is essentially a dice-fest. It's too complicated without being complex.

Fragor Games' 2011 entry in their annual Essen game series. Glad they went back to the cute animal sculpture tradition of their Shear Panic, Hameln and Antler Island days. This game has a lot more going for it than just Wallace and Grommit style animals though. A lot of interesting spatial things going on: building your own coral reef, evading a shark while trying to scoop up dice in the intertidal zone, and the best, a "wave" device that literally crashes and distributes new dice every so often. All this is in an attempt to score yahtzee style combinations of points. This might be my favorite game they've done yet, I could see my rating go up with subsequent plays.

They really should print some more of this game. Gaming brings a lot of fun to people. I don't understand the point of limiting that fun by printing a limited quantity. It is a fun looking game, but has plenty of strategy in deciding how to move your pieces to gather the dice which act as resouces.

2nd Edition as a purchase: 5

Family board game in its fullest, but there are a few too many rules, and there is a very high rate of 2nd ed copies.

The main issues I have are that the kraken tracken is poorly understood from a strategic standpoint, and interactions between rules are either not understood or exploited.  This means that people who don't/can't understand the meaning behind the rules have no clue what is going on and don't try, and people who can obsess over focusing on one or two rules as the key to victory.  Not one of our four players was simply playing it as a simple board game for fun.

Then there is the Game Salute problem.  The dice are hard to differentiate without very bright and clean white lighting, and if you are color blind they are worse. The wave--the thing that sells the game--doesn't work correctly and the company is all but saying they recommend you jam toilet paper in to stabilize it.  Of the 541 copies they Kickstarted, a good few dozen people have missing/broken pieces. To make it worse, the people who brought issues up early had their posts deleted.

Actually pretty simple despite the rules explanation. Players just try to collect sets of dice to rescue their friends.

The components are superb, definitely a wow-factor when introducing to newbies, and perhaps a simpler reef/coral system would have made this game better.

An interesting combination of over-the-top components and real strategy.  The cute as a button player pieces make this look like a silly family game, but the actual game play is fairly deep.
Do I build my coral reef or add dice to the wave?  Do I increase my movement, my eating or my dice rolling?  I don't think there is a wrong answer, but it does matter.

FOR THE KIDS: Let me say how disappointed I was that this EXPENSIVE game that we were promised was UNIQUE AND VERY SPECIAL and would never be printed again, got printed again. Well really, I don't care about that -- I like to see everyone get a chance at all of the games. But the second edition got miniatures that the first edition buyers cannot get unless they buy a second edition! That is a ludicrous breach of professionalism. I will never purchase another Fragor game. Ever!

It's too bad -- I really like the other Fragor game we own, but I don't trust the brothers anymore.

This game has the most amazing table presence. It's so lovely and it's fun when the dice spill off the wave and across the board.

We decided to trade it because it was too light for us, while also having quite a few elements to track. The combination just wasn't right for us, but we can see why other people love it.

It arrived on September 8, 2015. I'm  slightly disappointed by the insert given the cost and the nature of the components; also, the Giant Wave is poorly executed and needs shims to make is rigid. I'll have to make a foamcore insert for it and find a way of making some semi-permanent shims.

This is way the most eye-candy that I have in a game! However, don't be fooled by the cutesy components and artwork, this is a serious game. 

The Reef mechanism is excellent, the tension of the Shark is brilliant and the decisions about which dice to use are tough. Looks like a kids game - but sure doesn't play like one!

Super-cute little models, and the 'crashing wave' quite amusing.  The setup time is ridiculous and the game is awfully convoluted.  Do this while stacking that when eating this move this there to gain a piece here which allows you to take a marker there...  Way too much for a silly game, not enough for a serious game.  Still, had a good time.  And actually won big!

What a unique game. I'm so glad I played it and yet doubt I'll ever play it again. The mechanics are so unique, the production out of this world, the very idea amazing. It's a beautiful, amazing game that everyone should play once. It's hard to describe what makes it so different from other games, but it is truly unique. I'd play again. I'm going to veer from my usual policy of following bgg rating standards and rate this higher than I normally would based purely on play frequency, because this game just deserves it.

Pretty pieces, but nothing special in regards to gameplay. The reef building mechanic seems underdeveloped as the best strategy appears to be "build taller" leaving "build outward" as a poor choice, as the stats only benefit from being higher. Piece moving and eating always feels like setting someone else up for a better move, and I don't enjoy planning a path based on what dice are where. Decisions didn't feel interesting. Give it a try, but I caution against investing before.

One play and I wasn't blown away from this. I uses the simplified level-up building system from Antics!, but where in Antics! starting your game with building up an efficient ant-hill, here it seems to be better to go for those dice as fast as possible and score the big points. I don't mind owning this game, but I wouldn't be sad if I didn't own it after playing this.

This looks really cute, but it is no walk in the park. There is a good amount of luck, but you can plan a lot of interesting things. Two player has a lot more control over the shark, and the motion around the Kraken seems pretty interesting. One thing is that it seems that building the reef needs a lot of consideration, particularly when you have to place the death tokens on it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Let's get this out of the way first; the bits are absolutely fantastic.  The sculpts are adorable and of the usual high quality.  The art is whimsical and a pleasure to look at.  The wave is clever and fits the theme nicely.

With that said, this is a pretty disappointing new game from Fragor.  I was really hoping that they had managed to create a better game for their fascinating "ant hill" mechanic.  Sadly, this is not the case.  Instead, the watered down version presented as a coral leaves very little in the way of interesting decision making.  Much of the game is left to luck as your dice are rolled off the wave.

Getting the most dice on the wave is key.  The more dice you have available, the more likely it is that you'll get one of the better bonuses when the wave crashes.  Plus, you get the benefit of having more dice available for others to take, pushing you faster around the "Kraken Traken" to automatically safe your next friend.

It's awfully cute - my nephew was entranced with the cute pawns and the breaking wave. Game play has a fun twist on dice pattern building though the flow worked out a little too fiddly on first plays for a family-themed game. Maybe it will grow on me more with a few more plays. I hope so. This game wasn't cheap. ;-)

Just a enjoyable game that is nice to look at and play.

I bought this game in preorder, being one of those who couldn't resist the hype. When I read the rules later on, I had the impression that this might be a fun game. Yesterday we put it up to the test, and fun we had.
Breaking the wave is BIG FUN, hopping around with the figures is BIG FUN and let the shark eat your opponents is BIG FUN.
The game isn't that complicated, but hey, we don't need a brainburner every day, do we? 
This wave will ceertainly hit the table more often.
If it lives up to the hype, I don't know. But I don't care either, for I am glad that I bought it.

The game is simple and straightforward, put the dice (food) on the wave or you increase your reef (which allows you to make actions more efficiently). then move your figure and feed it. spend your food to free your friends from the kraken and score points. move the shark and, if so, get eaten by it.
Simple as is.

Fragor continues to make visually appealing games with straightforward rules.  PK is no exception as it can be easily set-up and explained allowing the players to dive right in. 

What I struggle with is a certain inelegance or frenetic motions as one executes a turn.  Maybe it is just a sign that the turns aren't that complex and we just race through the various stages of a turn.

Bought on Spiel 2015.

Nice Game with not too much thinking Part. It take a while to understand the best between riff building /  place dice on the wave and take dice from the board the free friends.

For me its a 8.0 because the starting from the game where no dice at the table is bit boring and when you can take dice there a often not the numbers you needed for your friends. And even when you have good numbers they will be often not needed when you get the bonus to rescue friends for free.

My Girlfriend would give the gamee a 10. So i rated a 9.0 for the middle.

The Parts from Game Salute are much improved to the first version from Fragor. The Cuteness is the same! :)

Four-player, one time - seemed like the ideal number.

The wave apparatus works beautifully, and the players' personal coral reefs mechanic (introduced as the anthill mechanic in Fragor's [thing=80642]Antics![/thing]) is not simply a matter of building upwards, thanks to the game-end bonuses, which can reward expanding the reefs outwards.  The wave crash triggering the sharks' direction reversal helps to keep players on their toes.  

All around, fun!

1 play, 3er

A quick, light, fun, beautifully produced dice-allocation action-selection (sort of) game. It recycles the action selection mechanism of Antics, but I believe this is simpler (with fewer types of actions?). The reef may be a bit too simplistic, although I guess that fits for a game of this (short) length. 

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
The game starts by using the wave tool to crash = randomly distribute dice on the board. On your turn, first either:
- add dice to the wave; if it's completely filled, the wave will crash at the end of your turn (adding dice randomly to the board). When it crashes, players sum all their visible dice and get rewards (e.g., sneak peak at end-game scoring coral tokens, add dice to wave) for having higher sums.
OR
- build your reef. Your reef starts with space to hold one die from turn to turn, and 5 empty spaces. When you add to your reef, you can build outward or upward; tiles you add have icons for the various actions. 

Then, you move one of your fish on the board and eat dice on your space. Taking another player's die moves their token around the Kraken Tracken board (every full loop around gets you your next unclaimed scoring token, and a bit of knowledge about some hidden VP tiles). You can save some dice you ate, if you have any space in your reef, and/or turn dice in to claim a scoring token (which require various combos, e.g., sum of 7, low pair, high pair, trip, 4 different dice). Players claiming each type of tile earlier get more VP. Depending on where you land, the shark will move several spaces eating any fish along the way (those players must place a bone token on one of their reef spaces, making it unusable). Eaten fish return to the board at either end (player choice).

Most of these things -- loading the wave, moving your fish, eating dice, storing dice -- depend on how you've built your reef. For each type of action (except storage; height not relevant), you look at the highest appropriate icon; the higher the icon, the stronger the action (e.g., move further, eat more dice). 

The game end triggers when someone has claimed all their scoring tokens; every player gets one final turn. On this turn, they may use dice to claim 2 of the hidden scoring coral tokens, which give you VP depending on how you've built your reef (e.g., for each visible wave icon, for not having any bone tokens). Most VP wins.

I like the figures but that's all. There's nothing really big in the gameplay. The wave is big I agree but doesn't work properly. Not good enough for me.

Being a shell is not one of those themes.

Fairly average overall. It has a really cool gimmick with the wave, but the rest of the game feel a bit random and silly.

The anthill mechanic is a fantastic one, so if you were the one who "invented" it why not transfer it to another game of yours? The anthill mechanic's still nice even though now it's a coral reef mechanic, the figurines are as cute as they are awesome, the whole presentation's fine and the tidal wave really adds a nice new never before seen mechanic. It's not for the hardcore gamers but it's for gamers who like their gaming both casual and hardcore.As I have spotted with several other Fragor releases half the fun of playing the game is coming from playing with it.

I played this at a CON and fell in love with it. I actually pulled out my iPad and ordered a copy on the spot. I hope to get it to the table soon. 

::UPDATE::
After a few plays, I'm happy with the game. It's not deep, but it provides some interesting decisions tactically, and strategically. For that, I find it better than a lot of other games in the same category that tend to get a lot more praise. Takenoko, for example. Aside from the eye-catching components and art, I don't understand the popularity with that game. I would play this game any day before it, and I find them to fit in the same weight category.

This is a tricky game. It absolutely looks like a family game in every way. Even it's most notable mechanic, the dice wave, gives it the family vibe. This is NOT a family game.

A player has a lot of plates spinning in this so the amount of information to consider and track alone makes this purely a gamer's game and a pretty heavy one at that.

Needs more plays.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 1

My first impression of Poseidon's Kingdom was that it was cute. It's got some serious cute overload going on. The game is a little overproduced with thick cardboard and some huge miniatures and it's all just adorable.

Given how cute the game looks and the fact that it's all about dice, I had a little trepidation about whether it would actually be an enjoyable game. Luckily those fears were unfounded.

The game has a big "wave" construct where you can "load" dice by putting them on the appropriate dice spots. At the beginning of the game you seed the board by tipping over the wave and spilling dice onto the board.

On your turn you either load dice to the wave, or build your reef. Then you move and eat dice in the spot you are in. You can eat anybody's dice, but there are reasons why you might prefer your own or someone else's (more on that later). There's a shark that moves around the board and it's bad if he eats you. How far he moves depends on where the last player ended up... but it's usually just one space on every player's turn.

Building your reef involves taking a tile and adding it to the tiles you start the game with. The tiles have symbols which relate to how many dice you can place on the wave, how many spaces you can move around the board, how many dice you can eat, and how many dice you can store from round to round. The wave/move/eat dice tiles all depend on what level you put them on. If you build your reef higher and higher then you get the associated ability equal to the level height of your symbol. Of course, there are some end of game points that want you to have a lot of symbols, which conflicts with covering up symbols to get higher. The dice storage spots don't care how high they are as they only have room for a die regardless of where they are.

Loading the wave gets more of your dice into play when the wave breaks (which happens when all the dice spots fill up). That does a couple of things. First, it give you a bonus depending on the total value of all your dice on the board after the wave breaks. Second, it spins the shark around and he heads the other way. Third, it puts more dice in play for eating, hopefully yours.

The primary point of the game is to get points by freeing your friends off the Kraken board. That's done by spending dice to meet certain goals, like three of a kind, four different dice, etc. You use the dice you've stored and/or dice you eat from the current turn to meet those goals. Each goal has enough tiles for each player next to it and those tiles decrease in value as more people complete them, so there's a race to be first to do each thing. When people eat your dice instead of their own, then a meeple of yours on the Kraken board gets a movement bump for every die they use. When your meeple completes a full circuit of the Kraken board you get to release your lowest level friend and peek at one of the end game bonus tiles.

The game ends when someone frees their last friend. Everyone gets another turn to eat and spend dice on the endgame bonuses. You get points for all the tiles you took when releasing friends during the game and the end game bonus tiles you bought.

The game is interesting and there's definitely some strategy. Do you eat your own dice, which avoids giving other players bumps on the Kraken board, or do you leave your dice on the board and hope for a high pip value total when the wave breaks so that you can get a better wave break bonus? Where will the shark be when it finally gets back to your turn and where should you move to avoid being eaten? Can you do something tricky and force the shark to eat someone? Which dice will let you get the first "free a friend" bonus on the harder, and higher vp, piles?

I think the game is maybe a little more on the family game side of things, but there were still some things to think about and it was fun to play. I don't know if after you get over the cute factor whether the game will hold up to repeated plays.

Even though the game is quite chaotic (your fate in some areas is pretty much determined by other players and then there is the chance that your dice roll off the board), I had fun playing it. The "dice wave" gimmick is original (I really wonder how they came up with THAT idea ;-)), and the action tile mechanic from Antics (the part of that game that I liked most) is perfected here. All in all it is an OK game with beautiful components. No need to own it, but would happily play again.

RATING: 6
First impressions: 
Poseidon's Kingdom is a fine example of how individual parts do not make a game whole. Both the anthill and wave mechanisms are novel and quite brilliant (someone sell me Antics! please!) I truly enjoyed both mechanisms and the first I have seen anywhere though the overlapping strips in the anthill design remind me Schacht's Dschunke. The way dice are distributed on the wave and allowing them to crash is also truly awesome in a way that is seldom seen or employed in other games. 

But alas, the individual pieces really did not fit well within the game. For starters, I the unique mechanism felt disjointed and did not flow with the story arc. Why would fish go around eat dice to free their friends from the Kraken? Why would they travel in such an odd path and why would the existence of the reef determine their fate? I think because of the disjointed actions, players did not remember the flow and sequence of the game as it was just not intuitive. I constantly had remind them of all the moving parts and because of that, we lost momentum for the game often.

Yeah, the Fragor Brothers design is pretty to look at and pretty unique in its own right but the experience of playing the the was anything but pretty. Where can I get Antics!?

Extremely cute middle weight game, where you build up a reef that defines what actions you can do and how powerful they are. Actions are things like moving your fish, eating and storing dice, or loading the big wave with more dice. Ultimately, you move your fish around the board, grab dice that have rolled off the wave, then use those dice to purchase tiles for points if you qualify (one tile needs 3 of a kind, one a 3 long straight, etc). Avoid the shark while moving, or your action reef will fill up with unusable spaces, making future actions even tougher.

I'd read lots of reports on how light this was, but I found there was more game here than I was expecting. There's a spatial element to building up your reef which I found quite difficult. Each time you grow upward, you cover up something else, and I repeatedly found I was covering things I needed, or couldn't grow because I wouldn't be able to do what I wanted.

Expensive, but worth it.

Good game unlike any other. Surprisingly many things to balance and choose between. Could be very good if it holds up to repeated plays. Very nice components - prepare to add 15 minutes for a photo-shoot before playing.
Rating: 7 for the gameplay +1 for originality and components.

How adorable is this game?  The playing pieces were great (I especially loved my dental-impaired starfish) and the giant wave added a neat mechanic.  Even though this was a very cutesy looking game, there was a lot going on as far as balancing your moves and strategies.  Do you try to build up your coral reef in order to be in a better position to collect needed dice combinations and rescue your friends or load the wave so others are forced to pick up your dice and move you forward on the Kraken Tracken?  Do you try to avoid the shark or risk getting eaten in order to pick up the dice you need?  Lots of fun!

So this is probably just a "solid 7" Euro but I'm giving it a full point for the classic quality Fragor figures and another full point for the innovative use of the dice rolling/wave crash mechanism.  The shark reminds me of Sherman from Sherman's Lagoon.

A colorful extravaganza of cascading dice.  With decent game play as well.  I'm not sure there is enough game play here to be a top notch game for the long term, but it is enjoyable and fun.  The problem is the price tag - it is darn expensive for what is really a family game.

Like: Theme. Wave and Reef System. Scoring.

Dislike: It's basically a complicated version of Yhatzee. Pieces feel incredibly fragile. The Shark.

The combination of the name of the designers, the strict limit to 1000 copies and the nice models inside the game, makes that this game is badly wanted by boardgamers. The cheapest copy of this game I found on the internet was EUR150. Well to be short. This game is not worth that amount of money.

The rulebook is a bit chaotic. Yoy have to read and re-read it several times before it will come clear to you. There are also lots of small jokes in the rulebook. It’s funny, but it doesn’t make it easier to understand the rules. Also there is a lot of small rules. This will make it a hard job to explain this game to other people. And that’s not neccesary at all, because it’s a pretty easy game. All the things you have to do in your turn is:

    Build (on a) your coral reef or b) the big wave)
    Swim
    Collect food (and a) store it or b) eat it)
    Move the shark

Of course, each actions has a few more rules, but these really makes sense and just are logical. This makes it an easy game to play. It took us about 40 minutes to play the game and 80 minutes to get through the rules and understand them.

Fun game, worthwhile playing this? Yes. Worth buying it? No. Just make a reprint (I understand that this won’t happen) and give a a normal price (about €40) and then it becomes a yes.

Fun, with a good pace.  It's fascinating playing a dice game in which [b]you[/b] don't roll the dice; the wave does.

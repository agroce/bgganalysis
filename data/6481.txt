A very different 2 player game from the norm.  Lots of fun, great pieces and easy to learn.  There is a fair bit of depth in it and a little luck, too.  The mechanics are fun and I love the scoring system - basically you can do well even if you aren't in a position to go after your first goal of matching your pawns to the spectrum.  The fact that you can alter the order of the spectrum and force your opponent to swap pieces is great fun and can lead to ructions - esp late in the game.  If you like Lost Cities for it's lightness, quickness, ease and subtle plays, you will probably like this for the same reasons - and it also plays in rounds of three hands at a time!

My 9 year old daughter really enjoys this game now.  It sat on the self for a few months before we played it.  She likes the  movement of the pieces and the whole premise of the game.

It's good for her because she does not usually like games with a screw you element, but I think she is getting past that stage now. 

The components are very nice.  Very colorful pieces and quite large.

After three plays, I am not THAT impressed with the game.  It seems a tab simple for what it is, but it's light enough to play whenever she asks to.

My 7 year old daughter does not get this game as yet.  It is rated for 12+, so that's no big surprise.

when a swap card (between players) is played, it becomes a battle of who has the most, plus other niggles. A rule not to swap the same pawn back and forth move after move could be nice. Still, somehow not a very nice experience.

RATING: 7
Rearrange colored pawns to match the order of colored blocks.  Surprisingly rewarding - it's hard to figure out an initial strategy, but then everything falls into place, and you start moving colors and making chains.  There's a little bit of 'take that,' but not too much.

Another fun 2 player game. Many of my game playing sessions are with my girlfriend or my roommate, so I have a good collection of 2 player games. This one is a good, tight abstract where you are playing cards to manipulate you line of colored pawns to match a series of colored blocks in the middle of the board. The girlfriend loves this one, plus it's a little hard to find, so it's not going anywhere!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Creating order out of chaos, with plenty of cards to muck it all up again. A 2-player positional puzzle game that I like far more than I should, as it is too random to claim your wins were through sheer cleverness alone. If you like control and forward planning, beware! But although strategy may be a bit hit and miss, the simple truth is that with utterly basic and familiar mechanics and georgeous components, this intriguing puzzle game just draws you in and makes you forgive all its flaws. 

It has a touch of the early-learning centre about it, but in a good way. The colours are bright, the pieces perfectly formed, slightly oversized, and made of wood. A sensory feast. The rules are taught with a few lines, the game rattles along at a fair pace, and instant replays are a given. A perfect cafe table game, and one that will turn many a head.

At times it can be a bit tit-for-tat, and it's probably decided when a player finally fails to draw a card that blocks the upcoming game-winning move from the opponent (those that alter the spectrum, and those that allow you to swap a pawn with an opponent). I guess some games just appeal far more than game play really justifies, and there is nothing wrong with that. It's seductive, and does make friends from many ages and abilities very easily.

The designer reminds people to play the, what became, "swap end-pawns" cards how he originally intended it instead: move one pawn to the other side and nudge all others one step across.

A fun and quick 2 player game.  All my friends and family who have played it really enjoy it.  I would say it relies too heavliy on the luck of the cards, as a good stratgey can be obliterated by drawing nothing but Move 1.

Well, it's ugly. And you have to be kind of careful when you move your pieces, because it's easy to bump into adjacent pieces. But it *is* fun, and it plays quickly...and has a bit of nastiness in it as well. No major gameplay complaints.

Good spatial manipulation game.  The "swap with opponent" cards add a nice dose of messing with your opponent that keeps things interesting.

A decent abstract two-player.  It reminds me of a two player Guillotine.  Light-hearted and fun, with plenty of screw your opponent tactics built in.  It's easy enough to play with younger players, which will probably keep it around after I tire of it.

RATING: 7
I enjoy this game a lot, but I am coming to the conclusion that the single biggest factor in determining who wins is who draws the most "exchange pawns with your opponent" cards.  Obviously, that is not the only factor, but it seems to be the biggest one.

A nice 2-player abstract. Its lighter than it looks, but there is room for skillful play. The pawn draw and the card draw may end up favoring one player significantly. The rules call for playing matches of 3 games, but we usually have had our fill before that long. 

The components are attractive. If you enjoy games like Odin's Ravens, Balloon Cup and Lost Cities...you'll probably enjoy Phoenix on the lighter end of that scale.

This game is very colorful, which I love, but it's not one you can play a lot, because you would just get board. It's really a kind of filler game, but how many filler games do you need when it's just two players? 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.8
A good light game that is enjoyable when you don't have the spare cycles for total brain burning.  Nice chunky pawns similar to Ninja Galaxy and heavy cards.  The designers have indicated that the "swap end pieces card" is really a shift card, meaning you remove the pawn from the end, shift the remaining pawns to fill the gap, and put the picked pawn in the now open space.

The game gets interesting as you decide whether to hose your opponent and slow them down or advance your own cause.  I am spatially challenged, so my wife kicks my butt at this game, but I enjoy the losses, as it is still pretty close.  A perfect example of a game in the sixes that I still enjoy playing.  Occupies an important niche in my gaming ecology.

I have to admit that my ratings are a bit scewed when it comes to abstract games like this. I am not a big fan of them for the most part. So as far as abstracts go, this game is alright. I like the card playing mechanism and there is some thought involved, though don't expect to contemplate it for too long. Its a mildly entertining game that I wouldn't mind occasionally passing the time with. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice little two-player. Rules say to play 3 rounds, but since you score the round and add points, you could play as many as you like, or to a certain score, or whatever. The randomness of card draw and chaos of cards that opponent plays means that this is not a game to take seriously, unless you're playing a lot of rounds. Rounds are only 10 minutes or so, so the pace has a nice clip. Getting your pawns sorted feels like implementing a bubble sort. :-)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Simple and colourful game with perhaps a tad too much take-that. It takes a bit of thought to look for optimum rotations and translations. Between skilled players, the luck of the draw becomes quite influential, and that is, to be honest, problematic. You really ought to play a full manche of 3 games, but I can't be bothered to do more than 2 in a row. And that means that luck isn't washed out sufficiently. In addition, there are cards in the deck which allow you to mess with your opponent. This keeps the game lively, true, but they also cause the game to take on a take that-feel from time to time. Try before you buy.

RATING: 7
Components: Hefty wooden pieces, and clear iconography on the cards.

Experience: An interesting, competitive puzzle, where each side is trying to efficiently arrange their pieces, while keeping an eye to take advantage of opportunities on the opposing side. Biiiig luck factor, both in the initial set-up, and the cards drawn. But games usually take fewer than fifteen minutes. I enjoy having to adjust my tactics when I realize that my opponent is closer to completion than I am.

RATING: 6
Good idea for a game with some flaws in the implementation. It can become tit-for-tat with the 'player interaction' cards (switch two spectrum pieces or exchange one pawn for an opponent's), and the person with the final tat likely will match the spectrum first to end the game. However, you can get points other than by ending the game and sometimes can keep the score close when you have no hope of matching first.

RATING: 4
Seems like a nice 2-player challenge, but so far it strikes me as highly dependent on your pawn draw.  I think it might be better if there were more cards that let you alter the center spectrum.  The cards that let you swap pawns with the other side tend to just get used in succession by both players until one person runs out.  Also, I think "Spectrum" would have been a much cooler name for this game ;)

RATING: 4
Too random. I have other games that play in the same time which I'd rather play. The one thing that might make me keep playing this instead is that it takes up very little space and is thus suitable for playing on a small table in a cafe or restaurant where you also need space for food.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
Over 3 rounds the luck of the initial placement tends to arbitrarily grant a win to either of equally matched players. But, the play is light and enjoyable, and there is some tension to the game. My wife enjoys it more than myself, so I play it more than I'd like.

Played 2 times. Very nice colorful production. One or two of the action cards seem alittle more powerful than the others (ie. the 'swap sides' card) but the game has a pleasant feel to it with just enough in it to make you feel clever without hurting your brain. A simple action card game of arranging pieces to match a (possibly changing) sequence. I would have liked this even more if it had had some sort of theme!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Enjoyable, easy rules, simple play, colorful.  It has a high element of luck which I always rate lower.  Phoenix has a problem:  It lasts 3 rounds, and if at the end of the 2nd round one of the players is far ahead, then there is no way to catch up.  One solution is to consider each round as a game, and play best of 3 games.  That way, you bypass the useless 3rd round if one player is too far ahead by the 2nd. My non-gamer children often ask to play this one.

RATING: 6
Interesting challenge of aligning your colors to match a pattern that can change at any time.  A bit random but fun still.  Since your choices are card-driven and your starting point is luck driven, yes you may not have much control on a bad situation.  Got this on a huge discount so not sad at all to get it.  Will play again with my daughters.

RATING: 6
Subtle neutral tones lightly caress the grayish pawns in this monochromatic game of blocks.  Ok, actually this game vomits color.  This is a game of getting your pawns in the same color sequence as the blocks in the center of the board by playing cards the switch pawns this way and that.  You definitely have to think ahead in this one, but bad cards can kill ya.  If you like puzzle-type games, you may like this, but there is chaos as well.  On the whole, not a bad game.

[Initial Impression: 6]
A light and portable game with colorful pieces, the goal is to arrange your colored pawns in the same order as a set of central blocks.  Movement of the pawns is governed by the cards in your hand.  Most of the tactics lie in knowing the distribution of cards so that you can anticipate what moves you and your opponent are likely to be able to do in the near future.  It's important to try to meet certain conditions (have one pawn of each color, 3-5 pawns in a row, etc.) to score points even if you're not the first to get the correct order.  After several games, you start getting better (mainly due to learning the distribution of cards and how best to use certain combinations and paying lots of attention to your opponent's pawns) but that's also when the game begins feeling stale.  Because the tactics are relatively straight-forward and limited by the available cards, I find this one a bit boring, but I play relatively often because my primary gaming partner enjoys it.  My interest might be somewhat revived if there were an expansion that provided new movement options or changed the card distribution.

Cracking little game with great component quality, simple rules and a very good scoring mechanism which limits the luck of the cards. Although you can still be very lucky with initial pawn placement.

Phoenix is a totally bland experience of array sorting with pretty colors.  The chaos really takes me out of the game despite the seemingly well designed cards to mitigate luck.  I also think the scoring needs some serious work as going out yields way too large a bonus while sets of colors yield too small.  I wouldn't really recommend this to anybody even though that one rabid guy here on BGG (you know who you are) thinks it's the greatest thing since sliced bread.

A peaceful kind of game.  Maybe too abstract for some.  I like it.  You can play it lazily by just going for who gets their pieces in order first or you can play it with the scoring as written which adds more strategy.  

It reminds me of Rack-o which I also like.  My husband finds this comparison baffling.

First impression after one game:  Starting draw seems very important to finishing first, but other ways to score might lessen the impact of an unlucky draw.  Not much direct interaction with your opponent, other than swapping pieces or rearranging the blocks.  Feels more like a puzzle than a game, but it was still fun.  Easy to learn & teach, which is a big plus.

Me and my wife have been playing/trying out two-player games and this one was instantly enjoyable, instantly fun and unbelievably easy to learn, and explain.

We both fell in love with this game because of the simple and fun mechanics.  The quality of the playing pieces is beyond compare - some of the best game pieces out there that you want to gobble them up they're so attractive.

It's lost a bit of lustre since we played it way too much - but I fully support giving this as a gift or picking up to play if you haven't.  It turned into me winning every game so we decided to move it out for something else.

On the surface seems interesting, but the gameplay is pretty stale. You're at the mercy of the cards in your hand and there really aren't many choices to be made. Sure it is pretty, but when all is said and done I'm not proud of winning or disappointed for losing. A classic nothingburger.

Picked up in 2006 (Christmas 2005)

I have to admit that Kobra1 was right about this being a good game. Easy to learn and easy to set up. It is a bit of a brain burner as you have to factor in the luck element. I don't like the scoring mechanism that much however. Given the price, this is a fantastic addition and should see a lot of play. I  will probably construct a portable version using glass stones and printed business cards, possibly even a magnetic version as the pawns seem very slippery.

Needs more play, but so far it has been fun.  More luck than I tend to like in an abstract, and like most abstracts some people see the patterns, some don't.  Play with the rules as written, don't stop at just trying to get the colors lined up.  The game is much better with all the victory point awards over three rounds.

My wife loves this game, I like it too, just a little less. It's another nice, short abstract in our collection. It has more luck than, say YINSH, Quoridor or Blokus (which have none.)

RATING: 6.5
Phœnix is a quick two-player abstract. There are six wooden blocks, each a different colour, in a random order along the middle of the board. Each player has a randomly selected set of very bright coloured pawns. They take turns playing cards to re-order and swap the pawns, trying to match the order of the coloured blocks. Some of the cards swap pawns with the opponent, others move the blocks in the middle; but most are used to re-order your own pawns.

The game is reasonably light. There is not too much chance of analysis paralysis.

Phœnix looks really good, but the colour choices are problematic (orange and green defeat this colourblind player). We used little hats made out of sticky paper. The cards are coloured too, but this does not impact on play.

I liked Phœnix: it is challenging without being slow.

A fun abstract game using the cards you draw as best you can to get your pawns moved into their right positions, while being messed up by your opponent, and messing them up in turn.

This is a very "light" game. If you're a fan of abstracts in might appeal to you as a gateway to those kind of games with your kids. Your actions are determined by your hand of cards so something the winner is determined by who draws the best cards. However, with 5 choices you usually can do something useful. As a game with kids I could recommend it. As a game for serious fans of abstracts, like the GIPF series, I would say there are better games for your time.

Match your 10 coloured pieces to the random colour-spectrum of blocks in the middle before your opponent does. Play cards that move pieces or swap with your opponent or change the spectrum.

Play 3 rounds & highest total score wins.

The idea of a spectrum in this game was something that really appealed to me, particularly a spectrum where color is ordered differently than that in our world.  The addition of cards to what is otherwise a rather abstract game, add enough variability that my wife (or kids) have something of a chace to win.  This is good, as for a brief time, they wanted to play quite a bit.  My wife actually enjoyed it more than I (or she) expected.  She was quite disappointed to learn that it had been on the shelf for quite a while.  [02/02/2008]

One of the best two player games around.

After several plays, I really like Phoenix.  The game itself is visually appealing, with all of the bright color cubes and pawns, and the hand-management and positioning aspects of the game make for a pretty good and quick game for two.  The only part that I don't like is the damned "switch the pawns on the ends" cards, because they are f'ing worthless, and I've been stuck more than once with several of them in my hand -- but a word of note, I found a posting elsewhere that the publisher got those cards wrong, and that the cards' original intent was to move a pawn  to the other end and cause the whole line to slide; a little more utility, but still somewhat limited in scope.

This is a quick, fun game with easy rules and components that are both aesthetically pleasing and highly portable.  Great cafe game.

Enjoyable game for two. Not something I would want to play on a very regular basis, as the choices are not that compelling. On the other hand, the scoring rules do give some flexibility on what to pursue: being the first to reach the correct sequence, having all colours or having multiple pawns of the same colour in a row. No matter how bad you initial set-up, there are always possibilites to score points.
All in all, nice enought to own.

RATING: 5
[Eurogames 2003 edition] {Abstract, couple; hand management} I usually search for good couple games because I like to play games with my wife. When I came across Phoenix, it attracts me with the colorful bits. After reading the rules, I bought it because she prefers non-confrontational games with some luck, esp. when playing with me.

It is easy to learn Phoenix but it takes some time to master it. The card functions can be explained easily but players need to pay attention to the correct rule of "Rotation" card.  (The author states that it is a misprint in the English translation but this 'mistake' is common in all translations.)

The pawns are colorful. It may be the most colorful game in my collection. However, it's not suitable for color-blind players due to the red/green ones.  The pawns are useful in other games, too :)

The game is quite balanced. If a player can't use their cards to build the Spectrum, he may use them to get score by grouping colors. The function and distribution of cards are nicely tuned except the "Exchange" cards. Having more "Exchange" cards is clearly advantageous.  From my experiences, whoever has more "Exchange" cards is more likely to win because they have better defense power and more tactical choices. (e.g. you may need the "Exchange" cards to collect all colors) 

I found several minuses of Phoenix. Firstly, the interaction between players is real low - only "Exchange" and "Modify" cards can affect your opponent. Secondly, it's very luck dependent. The initial pawn arrangement of pawns can make a difference, though it might be balanced by 3 or more rounds of play. The randomness of card draw is too much for my taste because what you can do is limited by your hand. (e.g. I did have a hand of 5 "Rotate" cards several times; what could I do?  I have to figure out if it's my bad luck or poor hand management skill.) Thirdly, it's quite chaotic to control.

In all, it is a good casual game.  But I am very against that some players declare it is a very tactical (or even strategic) game.  It is a good choice for time-killing. Just don't take it too serious.

This is a good try for first-time designer.  Keep up the good work!

Worthwhile two player game that comes in an awful coloured box. Only Austin Powers could get excited by this box!!!
But don't let that put you off. the components inside are good quality and far less garish. It's also an incredibly cheap buy at the moment.

One thing I really like is that you can play 3 rounds (a complete game) in a reasonable amount of time (30 minutes or so) which keeps the game length right where it should be for this game.  The bits are nice to look at and very well made.  Simple rules are easy to explain.  This game strikes a nice balance between depth and playability, and is enjoyable to play while carrying on a conversation.  This is a very good 2-player game.

Phoenix is a pretty fun hand-management game with a very nasty "screw your opponent" element.  You are constantly wrecking each others' plans so the game is mostly tactical.  Still it's easy to play and it looks great so it's a good spouse game.

Unfortunately this one is out of print.  Someone should really pick this up.

Give and take aspect that was interesting, but alot is dependant upon the cards.  It's quick enough to play though, that it still manages to hold your interest throughout the game.

How can I turn down a game where the general goal is to make a rainbow-ish design?  Phoenix is a fun, light, two-player game with enough randomness (via drawing pawns/cubes, and cards) thrown in that while the better player will often win (games are played to three rounds), everyone will win at some point, which is good.  Don't expect deep strategy in this one.  One quibble - the scoring system is generally garbage.  I haven't played a game where the auxiliary points really mattered and overcame the points given to the player that won two out of the three rounds.

I usually don't go for two-player abstracts, but when your possible moves are dictated by cards I find it easier to handle without too much analysis paralysis. This one plays quick and still has a good deal of optimisation you can do. Certainly my chess playing engineer friend seems to be better at it than me..

Very clever game. From being behind to suddenly being ahead is not too far off. And always like games that I can genuinely play with the kids and/or adults too. Nice and short and good fun.

RATING: 7
Neat card game involving some clever play. Should I move my pawns or really mess up my opponent by moving the center pieces? Some games can end quite quickly, so it is best to play it several times and keep score per the rules. Very good value.

Phoenix is a bright, popsicle-colored rarity that plays a little too fast for its setup time.  With occasional exceptions, this is multi-player solitaire and something deeper is missing in the card deck.  It's a cute idea but best left for kids.

I really liked this at first.  The components are nice, the puzzle aspect is appealing, and messing with your opponents' set-up is fun.  But in the end, with equal opponents, the game seems to come down to who can get the right card at the right time, which is disappointing.

This is one of my wife's favorite two player games. Limited ability to strategize because the other player can mess with your setup, but that's okay because you can do it too. Beautifully produced.

RATING: 7
This was an interesting abstract game with nice looking components.  You and your opponent are both trying to order your set of colored pawns to match a preset pattern.  You're playing cards from your hand each turn that allow you to move your pawns over, swap pawns, or modify the preset pattern.  It seems like a game where it would be good to plan ahead and have good spatial awareness, but the card draw can make it somewhat unpredictable and your opponent's moves can definitely disrupt your best laid plans.

A colorful game which can be played casually with fun, or can be played cleverly by judging and cracking down the other plery's secret plan. The hand management of action cards is cruxial to devise your plan. The action cards and the changable goal makes the replayable and light enough as a 2-player game, particularly suitable to a couple. The scoring system is smart to balance out luck factors. Recommended as a good couple game.

A cute little game.  It bogged down a little more than I would have liked, but things were going faster by the third round, so maybe it just took some time to get into the mindset.  I probably like it more than most two player abstracts, but it didn't really wow me, either.

A cute game with nice pieces.  It's just a little too random for my tastes.  It's trying to be a strategy game but there is too much dependency on the luck of the draw.  I could see a better variant where the players draft cards but I'll probably never get it to the table to test that theory out.

Quick, fun, color coded "abstract" game.  No language or age barrier to game play.  Simple rules, lots of choices on your turn.  My wife even enjoyed this one - which is rare.

RATING: 5
I like the different ways that you can move your pawns.  It almost prevents you from getting stuck with a card that you can't use, but a bunch of crap draws in a row will put you at a disadvantage.  The way that you collect points allows for players who don't finish the spectrum to still stay in the game, which is good.  It does have some "Take That!" elements to the game, and players who are hesitant to hit their opponent WILL LOSE.  Unfortunately, it's hard to plan around the inevitable chaos, but good hand management should give you some advantage in the game.

This is best discribed I find as a light version of chess. It is a very balanced game. I find usually when a person wins, the other player is within 1-2 plays behind to win the game.

This is fun enough to play. I was surprised at how tactical it is - it's pretty difficult to have a long-term strategy and stick to it. I also can't shake the feeling that the decisions, while certainly feeling interesting, take a backseat to the cards available to you and the randomness in the setup. Still, it plays very quickly (usually) and offers more tough choices than most games that are this easy to teach.

Great 2-player abstract game with cards & colourful wooden blocks & pawns.  Reminiscint of RACK-O, players use cards in a race to re-arrange their pawns so that their colour order matches the colour order of the blocks.  It is a quick, fun, light game with a few neat decisions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Anything my husband likes immediately gets at least a 7.  The idea is simple and to the point - line your colored pawns up to match the spectrum in the middle, using cards to arrange and re-arrange.  More tactics than strategy, with a good dose of luck and little bit of screwage tossed in.  Recommended for ages 12 and up, but I think a bright 8-9 year old could give an adult some competition.

I'm not getting Phoenix.  Not well enough, anyway.  I have to learn how to play both offensively *and* defensively at the same time.  And it's hard for me to do; I concentrate too much on my own pieces and my wife wins in the meantime.  It's still fun, though.  Even if it's a bit random and lacks some control.

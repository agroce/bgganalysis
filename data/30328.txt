Played the full game, by the rules, and it went on for a bit too long, but my daughter and I had a blast still.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Very good fun, played with more as a toy than as an actual game.  It's neat to set the figures up and demolish them with the totally random flicks I achieve with the catapults.  I think as a game it would be very frustrating for an adult.  I am pretty happy to play it with my sons though, hence the rating.

RATING: 3.5
Great game for my 4 year old. The components look good even though some are made from low quality plastic/rubber. 

Nothing in the game play except to totally demolish your opponents army via projectiles. 

Lame for me.

Childhood fantasy of catapults and destruction. This is still the best of the best, and worth setting up year after year for a round of destruction.

Good luck finding it, it's a collector's item now, but who cares? It's too fun NOT to play.

Loads of fun on the right type of floor surface.  Note: the 'right type' of floor surface, typically limits my desire to complete a full game, as my limbs and joints incur pain from playing on tile. :)

more a toy than a game, this tit for tat combat simulator  pumps adrenaline and has a level of excitement that make it worthy of play at least once a year.

This is the newest incarnation of the original, and while it doesn't have all of the components of the original, it is an interesting twist on the lineage.

RATING: 6
A solid update to the original Crossbows and Catapults game that I treasured as a child. Kids love building their castle defenses and smashing down their opponent's, and adults will get caught up in the action as well. A nice mix of toy and game, as kids will likely want to play with the pieces even when they don't have an opponent for the full game. If you like painting miniatures, this gives you an opportunity to engage in your hobby while giving your kids a nice upgrade to the game.

RATING: 6
My oldest son received this for his birthday.  Anything with "guys" is always a winner, especially when you get to wipe them out with rubber band powered catapults.  Our coffee table makes a perfect battleground, as this disks fired from the crossbows slide quite well.  Since then he's picked up a couple of expansions to augment the carnage.  It's fun to play with my boys, but probably won't take out with my gaming buddies.  [Gift]

RATING: 8
Hey look, it's that TOTALLY AWESOME catapult game from the 80s remade so that you don't have to pay $100 for it on eBay!

If you know what you're getting into -- a mindless dexterity game were you're flinging little discs at the opposing guys walls and guys with mini catapults -- then this game delivers and is a blast.  Don't expect anything more out of it.

The expansion don't add a lot, but they do their job--expanding the base game.  

This one is a no brainer for a kid-favorite.  I've 'played' dozens of games with my son, and we've yet to actually 'play' an actual structured by-the-rules game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Compared to other things I own, it's a 6, however when playing with my little brother (age 25) and all the expansions, I rate it a 10.  We can shoot things all night and have an absolute blast. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Outstanding. Always want to play, and expect this will never change. After all, it hasn't changed in 37 years. The beauty is its simplicity. If you think this is just a kid's game, take a walk down memory lane back to Kriegspiel: wargames fought with little soldiers and mechanical cannons that really fire to try to score hits on the enemy. This is admittedly a cartoony incarnation, but there's no reason why house rules couldn't make this a contender for an all time great game, at least if you have boys, which I do have one of.

OK, so this is a mindless, shoot up em game.  However, it is just FUN!  I got this for my son for Christmas (how do you argue with $9.95 at Toys R Us) and we have both had a bunch of fun with it.  In less han a week he has gotten real good and using the catapults to shoot my men down.  Also, I've used the game as a chance to begin teaching gun safety because these catapults will send the artillery across the room on a fly.  WE haven't started with the 2" movement rules yet but he's having fun so who cares.

Makes me feel like a 10-year old kid again! Better than Hormone Replacement Therapy or Botox! lololz! And which other wargame actually lets you shoot missiles at the opposing army?

RATING: N/A
Update: Gave this one away, as nobody at our house was playing it. 

Probably fun if you don't take it too seriously.  I had real trouble getting some of the weapons to work correctly.  And there was a lot of extraneous activity in the room, which lead to pieces being knocked over rather often.  If I play this one again, I hope it's in a calmer environment.  

Owned:  added when my step-son's collection merged with mine.

Cambiado en Nov2011 a jankovicz por La muralla China, Boom Town y Cata de dados. Curiosamente, justo el día en que llegamos al acuerdo, encontré una copia incompleta del juego en una tienda de cáritas, por tres euros. Ni qué decir tiene que me hice con ella, de modo que tengo casi dos juegos completos. Alejandro está encantado con el juego.

Es un juego de habilidad. Hay que eliminar a los contrarios lanzando fichas con catapultas, ballestas y demás armamento. Juego muy sencillo, adecuado para niños, y con un material excepcional.

Vendido en octubre 2014 a vicente.r2 de la bsk por 30€

A very fun, interactive wargame on a light scale.  Can also be used with H.G. Wells' "Little Wars" ruleset, which is the main reason I bought this stuff to begin with!

RATING: 6.5
I think this is some good, (very) light fun to have with your kid(s).  I can't say that my rating is attributed to the nostalgia factor, as I didn't have this game as a kid, so take that for what its worth.  I wouldn't want to play this all the time, but with the quick setup, I must say that I prefer this being suggested rather than Heroscape with its VERY long set up time.  I still like Heroscape, but for a quick "kids' game" this wins hands down in the "quick" category.

Pretty damn fun.. and actually works.  Sloppy rules, but I think it's safe to house rule anything you want.  It's still the best when you destroy the enemy's gate, and the flames shoot up and the guy launches off the top.

RATING: 6
If the little kid in you is still alive, the prospect of shooting up your opponents stuff with actual projectiles probably sounds fun, and it is!

The only drawback here is that the weapons are of varying quality.  Some work great right out of the box, and some require modification (usually just stronger rubber bands) in order to be effective!  Kids will still love it as is, but adults will be tinkering with it to make it work properly!

This game is a hoot!  What fun to shoot your crossbows and catapults across the table and knock down your opponent's troops and walls.  I only wish that there were some sort of melee rules for the soldiers.  The price for the expansion kits has gotten insane.  I bought mine at Toys R Us on clearance and was very pleased.  My kids love it.  Everyone that has played it has had fun.

A fun game, my main complaint is that it takes a lot of space and a lot of time to clean up.  My son loves it, but when I just want to play a quick game with him I always turn this down.  After the setup the game can drag on for way to long if no one is making good shots.

This is a fun game to play with the five year old and have played a few times with friends. The Little Wars feel of the game makes one want to change the rules to match that of H G Wells but we usually do a hybridization of the new rules which are vague and the classic rules from the 80's set.

09/08 - I bought this to play with my son someday. Update 12/2010 - I brought the game out a few times in 2010 for my son (3) and daughter (5/6). Well loved by both but we didn't play by the actual rules. It's enough fun just blasting each others walls to bits!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
You're largely buying the game for toy parts, including a few catapult weapons that are powered by elastic and kind of fun to shoot. The rules for the game are absymal, and essentially force the players to make up their own -- which is OK, my children and I can come up with house rules, but if the designers had showed half the attention to detail to the rules that they gave their plastic pieces, my rating might have doubled for this game. As it is, I have to be talked into this one by my kids.

Better than Attactix because of the open endedness of it.  It is an awesome toy.  Knocking over lego castles rules.  It is Crokinole (careful aim and clever banks) plus Loopin' Louie (precise finesse to land things right where you want).

This is an awesome re-issue I love this Toy Game!  The new rules and accessories mainly new weapons add so much I have played with my cousin once in a while we have only played 4 times and I finally beat him once!  But it is so addicting. I am playing this game along with the original crossbows and catapults game this battle has turned into a full out war!!!

Cool dexterity game that involves rubber band powered crossbows and catapults.  Launching disks back and forth while wiping out the enemy fortifications is fun, but maybe short-lived.  I would have played this tons as a kid.

I bought a bunch of B:C&C stuff on clearance.  The original Crossbows & Catapults played a large role in my childhood, and I just couldn't resist. I did, however, combine the stuff I own into one entry to streamline my collection a bit and make it easier to browse. :)

Nothing deep, but what the game offers in nostalgia, tactile pleasure, and sheer appeal to ones inner child makes for a very fun gaming experience.  The bits are beyond awesome, and the very real risk you could lose an eye adds a wonderful tension to all you opponents turns.  Yes it can drag on too long if played with official rules, but this is really a sandbox for a really cool table top war game.  This is what warhammer, and those other collectable games should really be - a dexterity driven smash-a-thon.

Because it is so flexible, both in victory conditions and even in what type of rubber bands you put on your catapults, this really may be the best two-player dexterity game in existance.

The main drawback is the mess and the space required.

RATING: 7
Preliminary rating, as I've only played with adults.  I'm sure my rating will go up when playing with kids.  It seems like a little boy's dream game, shooting discs all over the place.  I would be concerned maybe about breaking fragile things in the vicinity or losing the discs, but what can you do?  This sort of game is little more than just playing with action figures, as the rules are terribly vague and the game just begs for house rules, to either increase/decrease difficulty or time of play.  Personally I would be for shortening the game.  

Update: Having played with kids, I think they need to be the right age to make the game shine.  There is a significant amount of dexterity involved if you want the game to not be too long, and it is almost impossible to enforce the rules.  I guess it's ultimately more of a toy than anything else, but it's still fun for a little while.

Mmm...  Pointless nostalgia.  Have great memories of playing the original with my dad and neighbors as a kid.  Saw it in Walmart and knew I had to have it.

OMG!!!  Where do you get this game!  I was about to rate the old school C&C since i recently played Pirates on the High Seas which totally reminded me of C&C.  I was going to beg for the original to be re-released and my wish came true before I even made it. Sweet!!!

A great game if you have well-behaved children. And a great game if you have well-behaved adults.  A light game of skill (shooting rubber band powered weapons over short distances in an attempt to hit miniature targets) with minimal planning and strategy needed. Great for a tough day after work on a weeknight with a good buddy and an ale. Prepare to incorporate loads of house-rules before it's playable though.

Got this for my Son, great game for kids. It is good clean fun and has been since the 80's. It is a toy, but a good toy and with the right people (read a sibling with Crossbow and Catapults rivalries going back 25 years ) it can be fun for adults as well. 
I am partial to the old set but thats probably nostalgia. The new set does some things better, for example the walls are better at blocking since the attack disks are a little lighter an slightly larger.  The looks of the game is much nicer than the 80's version. (i own both)

This is just as much fun with my 4 yr old son as I remember when I was a kid. The rules could use a revamp and I am disappointed they didn't include a knockdown tower like the old Lakeside edition.  I might make a pdf of a moat someday and post it on here with my own house rules (based on the prev edition).

For games like this, however, the most important thing is inventing your own way to play.  This game is all about imagination.

Got it for my son for Christmas. I could criticize things like the vagueness of the rules and the fact that warriors can't melee attack. But I think this is the sort of game that must be appreciated simply for what it is and enjoyed that way without too much deep thinking.
Okay, I have now played it, and it's silly fun. Possibly it's just because we didn't quite have the ranges down yet, but it took a long time to finish. It just took too long, and we got a little tired of it. My opinion of it after a second play is pretty much the same: It takes too long for what it is. Probably some house rules are necessary, as suggested by several others.

This is unlike most of the games I've rated here, as in this game players position two rubber-band-powered weapons (catapults, cannons, etc.) next to a castle, build some walls, position some little guys around the weapons, and then proceed to attempt to destroy the other person's guys, walls, and castle by shooting little round disks at them.  This is a purely mechanical game, is not brain-burning at all, and is insanely fun.  Try it next time you feel the urge to blow up some buildings.

What a fun dexterity game.  You use weapons wrapped with rubber bands to fling your pieces across a room (yes, you need lots of space) to try and hit your opponent's defenses.  Not really any strategy, just pure flinging fun.  

A bit too much bending over for those of us getting a bit older, and a friend of mine hurt his knees hurrying around in excitement, but a fun, easy, stress-less game.

My five year old daughter would love this, but we're happy shooting catapults and bolt throwers at our new Roman Playmobils, so I'll have to pass for now. 

UPDATE: Saw it for $25 at KMart at 50% off. All stores seem to be selling this off quickly now - I saw expansions at $10 too. Tempted, but I could buy another Playmobil catapult for that.

UPDATE 2: Found in Salvos for $9. Complete except for one disc and rules. Should have bought the expansions a few years back! Anyway, it is mildly fun - my now 9 year old daughter loved it - but gets a bit old quickly, even with house rules. Good beer and pretzels game.

Ok, out of the box, the "game" is just too long for the amount of fun had.  The first few minutes are a blast, but there is a diminishing return as the game slows while you are trying to pinpoint the last couple of dudes.  

Really the game should just end when one of three conditions are met:
1. When your scrubs are dead.
2. If your flags are all knocked out.
3. If your castle then your leader are destroyed (You can put a power disc under the leader).

If you still want to play afterwards, just set up and play again.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Certainly not the deepest game, and the actual execution is a bit less fun than you might imagine.  But Crossbows and Catapults is still fun.  I also think it is best to play by some specific rule set rather than just set up and knock down as most kids want to play.  The default rules are okay, and they can easily be tweaked to add more objectives and rewards.  I don't like the rule where you can't fire the same weapon twice.  It makes the game harder (and longer) than it needs to be.

The look and general design of this version is *much* better than any previous version.

Man, what a blast from the past!  When I stumbled upon a complete copy of this game in a thrift shop, it instantly sparked memories of playing the old-school version in my childhood and I knew I had to get it.  And when I finally had a chance to play it with one of my brothers, it was a riot!  The newer, more "miniatures-like" rules are rather hit and miss, with the concept being cool but the measurement aspect being a little fiddly.  I feel like a couple of house rules are in order, but it's a fun game nonetheless.  It's perhaps a little graphically grotesque for its target market (eg. the chief Orc holding a knight's head), but the components (especially the weapons!) are top notch.  I just have to find another copy at a thrift shop so that I can have more bricks to build bigger castles.  And I need to pull out one of those catapults the next time we play Torres...  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 7.5/10

This is so silly, but so much fun. Played at sometime around 2am with Nato and we were laughing and encouraging each other, but taking the aiming deadly seriously at the same time.

I bought this on a whim and am now expecting to play it surprisingly often.

Update: It is a lot of fun, but it also runs a little long, has some under-baked rules and really is a toy rather than a game.

Traded for £15 (which is a £1 profit!).

Oh does this bring back memories!!  My brother bought this for me this Christmas when he realized it was newly released.  Everyone says the rules are different, but I don't remember the rules at all...I just remember the power of the crossbows, and bricks flinging through the air!! :)  After a single play tonight, I am happily satisfied that this is the game I remember, except for it looking so much better!!  House rules are a definite must, in my opinion.  But, the game still plays fairly well by itself.  So, if you've got a young crowd, the base rules still make for a fun game.  This is the first time my youngest brother has seen and played C&C and he's already played it 4 times in 2 days.  Needless to say, we will be playing this again :)

I'll rate this as a kids game.  The only way that I have played it is with my 8 year old and my 4 year old son.  I wouldn't mind playing it with another adult, but my rating is strictly as a kids game.

And as a kids game, it is fantastic.  When I was ten, I would have absolutely loved Battleground.  Seriously, flinging things across a battlefield--who wouldn't have liked it at ten years old?  Heck, I have a blast with my kids, and I can easily see how it would be pretty strategic yet very goofy fun.  How many games can claim that?

It's fun to use all kinds of plastic artillery to try and hit your opponent's forces, and the starter box offers good value for money. Still, the game is not without its problems. First, it is surprisingly hard to effectively use some of the artillery pieces (the cannon springs to mind), making the game last longer that it should. Second, the required size of the playing area will force most people to play on the ground, which means that there is a lot of squatting and getting up involved. This can make the game physically tiring. I definitely need to be in the mood for it in order to enjoy this game.

I was absolutely right.  This is a huge hit.  It is simple and childish for sure but all in a good way.  This is somewhat different than the old release.  This game actually features some interesting strategic choices.  I have nothing bad to say about it other than the unnecessarily large box that is supposed to impress but just gets thrown out.

The components look way better than the first edition, but the transparent elastic bands are not as robust as rubber bands, and seem to blow out their elasticity pretty quickly.  Of course, you also get pretty disappointing results from certain weapons:  The cannons bite big wind.  The ballistas can work pretty well on a sufficiently smooth surface, if you load them well.  The new, wheeled catapults need to be held in place, but do pretty well.  I adore the goofy fire that pops up from the castle when you hit the front gate.
Update: I've gotten some good performance out of the cannons, now.

Fun and easy racing game.  Just enough strategy in each deck with a dash of luck. Fills that racing space in my library without being to complex. Love it, and my group is a big fan.

Funny illustrations and funny powers(for the most part) and unique opaque player markers make this game a rather pleasant one to play with a beer in hand and a good company..or rather..it would be such a game if some things were not as they are: same illustrations for all the cards of each of the 6 possible factions, track pieces that are somewhat flimsy and don't fit to one another for the most part..let's say it won't see the table as often as it could have and all the times it does see the table, it shall be for 4 players+ (2player game is stupid, for 3players the track has to be reaaaally short for the mayhem (aka fun) to begin

Finding this game to be fun with all groups I've played with. May look into creating new track pieces like a few "y" or "x" peices...

Wacky racing meets Mario Kart in this zany board game of deck manipulation. Customizable race track to make each experience unique.

I think I gave this game a fair shake.  We played it many times and in the end it's just sort of mediocre. Not bad, but not mind blowing either.

Wanted to play this for a long time, and finally got to. It was about as I expected it to be, super duper random and silly. I wanted there to be just a smidgen more control. Also it was hard to tell the racers apart. Awesome art, not as awesome components.

Played it with designer Matt Hyra at GenCon one year. Loved it, had a blast. Dad was a gear-head, all the art reminded me of my childhood. :)

The game is fine. The card mechanics (no pun intended) are good. What I really like about this game is the artwork.

And that I got it for $5.

SO MUCH TRACK.  You can go absolutely wild with the race track setup which means almost no two games will play the same.  The parts fit fairly well if not 100% perfect, but when you have so MUCH to use, you can't expect them all to fit 100% perfectly.  Also the art is greaser/White Zombie/metal mix and is awesome.  If you played Epic Spell Wars - you know the vibe.  Played best with more than 2 players, this game could benefit hugely from expansions and new race crews.  The (intentionally) small decks mean you're constantly re-using cards, but the constantly changing position on the board means you always have different reasons to play them.  Fairly simple to play and the idea of racing a "season" as described in the rules seems like it could be a blast.  Definitely a unique setup - you're free to determine what kind of challenge you'll face - a speed freak straight heavy with lots of pit stops and hazards or a windy track with sparse stops where you have to weigh over taking the turns at high speed (and some damage) vs. slow and steady through the twisties and possibly running out of gas.  The level of complexity of a play session is entirely up to you as players!

This is what a racing game should be.  Fast and a little chaotic.  I like the art style but some dislike the middle school-er look.

Grabbed mainly for the art atyle. A bit of take-that mixed with racing. Actually fun, with a custom track and everything.

This is actually pretty fun. Probably better with less players, but it depends on how fast people can play. The randomness is obviously important, but the game still allows for player decisions that affect the outcome of the game.

Psychobilly. Hotrod. Racing.

Modular board that you can piece together and build and type of track you can imagine. Amazing and diverse cast off characters.I Vehicle upgrades. You have a deck of action cards that also double as your gas tank. Once you're out of cards, you're out of gas. It's a very clever game that is often overlooked. Probably because of the art, though I find that a plus for my group and me.

Fast,fun and silly race game with a pick on the leader element but it's not a super harsh "take that" as it's ez to make up for lost space. Uses some modern card techniques so while it looks simple everyone actually has a different deck with different advantages. I think it would pimp out nicely with mini-pitch car track and classic hot wheels.

RATING: 7
A fun and yet simple and whacky race game, where players are not only trying to win the race, but destroy each other in order to do so.

The game components are a little on the cheap side, but they work and you really get a lot of track pieces and they even included some cool cardboard stand-ups. Like the ring of fire, shark tank and the spectators seating, which was a very nice touch.

I really enjoyed this one and am looking forward to many more plays. It's a quick light game, that would especially be good for some family fun.

I really like the Big Daddy Roth like artwork as well. Fun game. Check it out.

Setup can take a little time (only because you get to build your own racetrack) but a really fun game of "take that" with a smattering of tactical play in there.

Love the Rat Fink-style artwork as well.

Received my copy today and played a 4 player game. Set takes some time but the game play is fun and engaging. Lots of strategy involved nearly every turn. Looking forward to many more plays of this really fun game.

RATING: 5.5
So far this is a fun, simple game with some 'rubber banding' going on with the racing. I'm not yet sure whether playing blindly would provide a significantly different outcome to consciously trying to win.

(edit) Further play has definitely proved that you can try to win and succeed! More help with how to set up good tracks would be nice, also the 5 and 6 player version can really bog the game down.

(further edit) The teams feel too samey, the upgrades aren't thematically satisfying. A bit more work and this could have been great, but I doubt we'll see the hinted-at expansion or any further work on this game.

Demo'd this at the MOZU booth at RinCon 2012.

It's easily the best racing game I've played - certainly more fun than Formula D/De - basically it's Mario Kart the board game only with awesome 1970's style psychedelic Ed Roth Rat Fink art. Tons of chaos, but the card driven play also allows for some thoughtful mitigation of that chaos. Lots of room for risk taking, and good hilarity. I especially liked how drafting was handled, how the car could be upgraded with humorous custom engine parts, wheels, etc, and how there were TONS of track pieces in the box, allowing for some clever custom tracks.

RATING: 7
Light, fun and colorful racing game. I dig the card mechanic where damage taken and "fuel" spent comes out of your deck. Plenty of Take That! 

Modular board means you never have to race the same track twice. 

Fun game, but can take up a bit of table space (depending on the track you build) and a bit of time to build a track. 

The cubes representing the cars are cool. Track components are fine, but a bit finnicky about fitting together. 

Played: Three times.

This feels like "Mario Kart: The Board Game." It's pretty fun, and I like that you can design your own tracks. The racers all feel very unique, and I get a kick out of the personalities that the upgrade cards have. The components are poor, but otherwise this is one of the best racing games I've come across.

This game delivers exactly what it promises.  I would have liked more examples of track layout, just to make it easy to play right out of the box.  The actual plastic player pieces need to be replaced, I will probably make standees from the card art.

It is a shame the box is so big.

Picked up for free at end of GenCon from the auction store! It was a game they didn't want to box up as it wasn't reclaimed by original owner. They offered them to people passing by their door on Sunday! I grabbed this one and a few others. Why not when there free! I haven't seen the auction store people do this again yet.

I first played this game with three, and it was ok, but the drafting and spatial effect cards weren't doing much of anything. After playing this with six I downgraded this rating from 3 to 2. Playing with more players did make the spatial cards work better, but they're not really fun. The race aspect of this game just isn't that well implemented, which is a shame because each racers gas tank deck is really cool. This game has some good ideas but just doesn't come together as well as I want it to.

Played three games of it in a row and was narrowly edged out by my girlfriend. We both enjoyed the game, and changed the track up and our teams up also (the different teams have slightly different decks ("tanks")), so it's good to try different ones.  The rule book was very good: every time we'd have an odd question, we found the answer pretty quickly.  I could really see myself snapping up an expansion for it (wish they'd do one for Epic Spell Wars too!), especially with some alternate path options and other obstacles or problems (and maybe with additional track length too).  Two player was ok, but I could see it being better with four or five.

Better than expected! I wouldn't seek out this game to play but if someone wants to have a few drinks and race, this is a surprisingly fast-playing game of fuel management.

Most factions aren't distinctive enough, with repeated cards, and upgrades seem grossly underpowered and specific, but the game itself feels balanced and rubber-bandy. Fun.

TRADE DESIRED: A racing game?

Very interesting mechanics in this game. I really like the concept of the gas tank deck of cards, and the ability to create your track. Maybe it doesn't quite fit my group, but I do want to try it again.

Update: Just finished a 6 player game with another group. Doesn't fire on all cylinders for me, but at least everyone else said that they really liked it.

Update: Ok... My group really likes it... just wish I did too!

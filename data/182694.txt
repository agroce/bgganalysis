RATING: 9
The combination of  case-solving a la "consulting detective" (Spiel des Jahres 1985) with some worker placement/outbidding mechanism for locations and special player powers works quite well. Though it may have not the depth of the original, it seems less dry and more entertaining.
The cases are well conceived, so I'm looking forward to playing more.

update: after 4 plays I raised my rating to a 9. The game is excellent!

note: not so good for 2 players, no solo mode, on the other hand great with many.
Eeven though the box says 2-7, this even works great with 8 to 20 people (play in groups, some space for group conultations needed)

The stories are well done. But the mechanics are at times an odd affair. The bidding system is serviceable and the players powers are adequate. The lock and key mechanic can be annoying which is perhaps the intention. And as a last point, players can be eliminated which although unavoidable in the design, is unfortunate in play. But thematically, it is there and the mysteries are compelling.

RATING: 7
Oh, I love solving mysteries. Watson & Holmes takes a less frequently seen approach on the matter since the deduction part of the games is not just simple elimination of possibilities, but you actually have complete freedom to give you own answers. This makes the game a lot harder and leaves room for interpretation but at the same time it feels more realistic.

Of course, games depending heavily on story telling are only as good as the story is (within the limits given by the game). Here the mechanics are simple enough not to limit the story too much. However there are a couple of things that feel a bit forced. For example the Watson mechanic feels completely unnecessary. Another one is the locking of certain clues from other players by placing a bob to guard it. You want to lock a clue when only you have read it, thus with more players you almost certainly must do that on your first turn. Hence the game follows a scripted path on the first turns. Moreover, since everyone has a chance to lock a clue, is the meaning of the whole mechanic reduced pretty much to zero.

I understand that these elements have been added to make the game more like a boardgame but in my opinion the game is better without them. You already have the characters with (weak) special abilities and you are bidding on the privilege to read clues, and that is all it takes to make this a boardgame.

I enjoyed the Sherlock Holmes puzzle aspect, although some of the answers felt "spelled out" if you went to the right locations, but I didn't enjoy that most locations did not add much to the mystery aspect and were simply worse than others.

The carriage tokens and police stuff felt tacked-on, adding "take that" simply to make it more "game-y".

Due to being a competitive game, the interaction was quite low, and I wouldn't need to own this.  If you're looking for a Sherlock Holmes experience with competitive aspect, this is a good game for you, but that's not what I am looking for.

Well, this is no Consulting Detective.  The small number of locations, each with a single clue, in each scenario means that Watson and Holmes' cases can't hope to match those of Consulting Detective for depth and subtlety.  I wonder about the bidding system whereby a detective piece can be turfed out of a location by using another with more coaches added.  In the scenario we played it was hugely beneficial to start at the murder scene. If another player pitched up and outbid you with coaches, a shot in the dark and a random clue was the only option.  Despite all this criticism, I did find Watson and Holmes reasonably good fun.

The artwork looks like nothing much, but is functional.  Production quality is good.

RATING: 7
This is a somewhat watered down competitive version of Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective.
It is watered down because the cases are a bit easier to solve, and there are no hidden clues in the map or newspaper (they are not elements of the game).
It is competitive because the players don't work together as a team, but compete to be the first to solve the cases.
It is very enjoyable, and I will probably play every case ever published... but it won't become a classic like SHCD...

RATING: 9
This is basically competitive mystery solving. A bit like if you combined Clue with Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective. Since the game is simultaneous action, it supports high player counts really well and you really want at least 4 people playing to make some of the mechanics (like unlocking Sherlock Holmes) more interesting. The tension that rises after each round and wondering how close your opponents are to solving the mystery is excellent. Some people will be turned off by the fact there can only be one winner and maybe not getting to solve the entire mystery themselves. That doesn't bother me too much. The post-game discussion that this game produces is also fantastic.

first play today. 4p. case 2. I tied for the win though I should've won one turn earlier. Twas not bad though I think so far, SHCD looks like the more interesting deduction puzzle. I think I like the competitive nature of W&H though I think SHCD is the better deduction game. Something gets sacrificed with the competitive game, including the fact that there are set locations to search in W&H.

RATING: 7
A competitive game of solving a mystery case. Everyone plays individually, but at the same time works on the same mystery case in a Sherlock Holmes style. Dont expect lots of interaction, but it's a fun game to bring to the table with friends. I must mention that once you played through all the cases, you're pretty much done (because you know the solutions to the cases), just like Pandemic Legacy and Time Stories arent repeatable. Its not necessarily a bad thing, but keep it in mind.

RATING: 7
Interesting little competitive worker placement-ish deduction game. It comes across as kind of a Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective light, and it's pretty enjoyable. You're bouncing around locations (cards) and reading their snippets of story trying to piece together a solution to a set of public questions.

It has a race feel as you're trying to solve the case the fastest. This appreciated because it adds tension and pressure to the situation, causing you not to want to waste even a single action. This leads to some interesting bluffing and manipulation from other players.

I only played the first scenario, and would be willing to play more, but I wasn't all that impressed with the resolution of the first episode or the game mechanics.  The gameplay makes it almost impossible for one person to figure it out earlier than the others (you will almost certainly be missing info if you try to guess early), and the method for resolving conflicts isn't very interesting either.

Might be better to play this as a relaxed, cooperative puzzle and just have everybody write their guesses as you go.

Deduction games really aren't my bag, so you can take this negative review with a grain of salt. I will say, however, that it's absolutely ridiculous that this game is listed by the publisher as playable with two players. It's not. Not even a little. With two players (or even three), you're never bumping into the other investigators, which essentially removes the game's entire strategic element. At that point, it's just "place pawn, scribble notes, rinse and repeat." BOR-ing! Things are better once you get to four players, but you still have to deal with the deathly quiet of the Investigation Phase, when everyone has their nose buried in their respective location card and thus can't make a peep of noise. It's almost oppressive how silent this game gets.

This game seems like a reimagining of the 1975 game 221B Baker Street: The Master Detective Game. It looks like the author took that game, got all the good ideas and then modernized it masterfully. By far one of the best games that uses the Sherlock Holmes universe.

Je ne surprendrais pas en vous disant que c'est un jeu d'enquête. Vous connaissez peut-être Sherlock Detective conseil (un jeu qui a eu un gros echo auprès du monde ludique et qu'on a à la triche). Vous aimerez surement Watson&Holmes. Vous allez avoir des enquêtes à résoudre. Réussir à comprendre les mobiles des crimes se fera de façon très narrative en fouillant les lieux de l'enquête. Oui mais ce n'est pas un coop, mais un jeu compétitif ! Le premier qui trouve, le premier qui gagne. Vous pourrez donc bloquer des lieux (ou alors mettre des bâtons dans les roues de chariote) pour empêcher les autres joueurs d'obtenir des renseignements cruciaux. A vos loupes !

The objective of the game is to immerse yourself in the Victorian world depicted in each story. Visit the right places, decipher the clues, and above all find the path that leads you to solve the mystery before anybody else. Victory goes to the player who accurately uses the deductive reasoning so famously and ingeniously implemented by the hero of 221B Baker Street.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The script (story line text) of the cases is excellent, considering, not only, the consistency required to join different pieces of text (spread among different game locations) into a solid story, but also all the "Holmes atmosphere" it can generate, beeing written in a quite elegant form.
However, as a game, it does not shine, first of all because there is almost no interaction between players (it´s almost like everyone is doing his own game, that is, his race against the time for beeing the first with a solution) and little interpretation inaccuracies can spoil several hours work.
It would be perhaps even more fun if this was just a solo game, although the after game discussions between the players about their views of the clues and the hints are very enjoyable.

This is a competitive game that includes multiple scenarios to play through. The players will go from location to location to get clues to solve the case. There are mechanisms in the game the players can use to try and block people from going to where they want to go. They work fine enough. When you think you have discovered the solution, you go to a location and check the solution. If you fail, you've essentially eliminated yourself from the game. I had a big problem with the note-taking in the game. How detailed should your notes be when you investigate a location? This part of game really dragged. I felt it should have had some sort of incentive to make people finish their note-taking as quickly as possible. Maybe that would lead to more incorrect answers, but I felt something could have been done to make things go smoother. My group agreed and after having played T.I.M.E. Stories, we wished it had been a cooperative game. I recommended Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective over this without even having played it. Not for me.

Es un juego que pretende parecerse a Sherlock holmes detective asesor pero tiene un poco más de estrategia además de que las partidas son mucho mas cortas y dinámicas.

No podría decir que me gusta mas porque no sería cierto, los misterios de SH detective asesor son mucho mas profundos y complejos, pero por esto precisamente no siempre se dispone del tiempo necesario para disfrutar una buena partida, en esos casos este juego es una muy buena alternativa, las sensaciones son similares pero con casos mas cortos y mas interacción entre jugadores.

Really interesting concept as each player mills around the board, visiting locations to gather clues and hopefully solve the case before anyone else. 

There is a bidding mechanic for locations and a lock down/open up location mechanic however honestly these feel shoehorned in to make it feel more like a game.... personally I don't feel it needs this.

It is rather strange playing this as you basically play in silence reading each of the cards and scribbling down some notes. I can see that this could lead to the game dragging if one player is making obsessive notes but overall as a group we were fairly balanced in the time it took us to read and note each location. 

Stories (at least that I have played) are interesting and you do not have to visit every location to piece together the story... but neither are you leaping to wild conclusions a la sherlock holmes consulting detective. I like that the questions are presented at the start of the story so you know what information you are looking for and what is and is not relevant... which is one of my biggest complaints about sherlock: consulting detective.

This is one of the worst games I have ever played.  It is not that it is a particularly poorly designed game, but it is definitely only barely a game.  It is essentially a choose your own adventure book printed on cards, and the players take turns reading an bidding on reading the cards first and take some possible actions to block others from reading the cards.  Essentially you sit down with people and take turns reading cards to yourself.  This is a suck example of a game.  I personally do not like reading to myself around other people and waiting for others to read to themselves and/or reading to my own self while others are waiting.  After all this is done round after round, players take once-per-game guesses at solving the mystery.  Did I mention that you have to sit there copying cards on to written sheets of paper?  Sucktastic!

Watson & Holmes is a game of deduction set within the magnificent works of Arthur Conan Doyle. Two to seven aspiring detectives step into the shoes of Doctor Watson, working alongside the detective Sherlock Holmes to try to solve a series of so far unpublished cases directly extracted from Doctor John H. Watson's diaries. Those who accept the challenge relive the adventures of the crime-solving duo, visiting each of the locations where the inquiries were made. Following the trail, each clue brings players closer to solving the case.

Watson & Holmes is a very nice competitive deduction game similar to Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective where players move to individual locations where they learn clues about the case. Players will need to make deductions and determine where to go next, what information is important and what isn't. Once ready a player can go for the win. If they don't have the solution, they can become a source of information for other players.

Provisional rating after one play. 

I think there is more depth to this game apart from the deduction element. The outbid mechanic; the ability to forbid access to a certain location (and the consequent bluffing, if you use it in the proper manner); the special abilities of the characters; the "resource management" aspect of the game; all point out to a very thoughtful design. 

I think that the game can show its true potential, if you don't play linearly and just travel from location to location, but instead try to "play" the game and outsmart your opponents.

I am very eager to play the rest of the cases. My rating will probably go up.

Similar to Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective, scales up in players better because its competitive instead of co-op. I find Watson & Holmes to be more palatable because the info is broken down into cards on the table, rather than having to scour over multiple newspapers and booklets. And as such, the gameplay isn't as long. I like the mechanic of locking a location from other players so they can't have access to that information. However, even with four players i didn't find that the game was as tight as i would have hoped, but that was only our first play. But now that i know that the game is still pretty fun even without the tension, i'd be willing to play it with 2 players, just to try and solve each case. But the addition of the tension makes it better, so i'd recommend more players if possible.

Played Case 0 - a good introduction, that answered some questions (e.g. how detailed did we need to be, etc). I like the game but with 3 it didn't feel very interactive. Gut feel is that I will prefer this game with fewer players (3-5 max) as it has less confrontation in selecting locations; I think with 6 or 7 it could feel very crowded - although then the carriage tokens would be of more use. A couple of issues with the rules but we sorted them out quickly. I hope that there will be expansions!
Also Case 1 as a (3p) learning game with Bigster (17). Her lack of familiarity with murder implements worked against her in this instance. We have been remiss in her education.

Sold out at Essen, which was a surprise.  I hope it is something my son can play as well.

Kind of like a simpler Consulting Detective.  The first was indeed easy but we had a good time.  Very solitaire, we still enjoyed discussing our different paths to the solution after the game ended.  Text is pretty basic and the characters sound more like they were written for tv dialogue than by Doyle, but still some nice humor.  

Scenario #1 a bit better, and I like how you have to deduce things that are not given on the cards directly.  Some nice small points in this case I missed, but fun to go back to the cards and see they did mention something that I missed.  Will have to be more careful the next time!

Totally not my idea of fun. I also tend to do badly at this type of puzzle solving (I don't know if I would have pieced the story together if I had read every card). Clues have no logical order, and in the game I played there was a critical piece clue on the "Scotland Yard" card, yet no other cards hinted that I should go there, so it all felt like a random crap-shoot anyway. For me, reading the long sections of text each turn - mostly full of the same clues repeated in different ways - was just tedious. I didn't feel like there was any strategy to this game - just read as many cards as you can and hope you're lucky enough to read the right ones before the other players.

RATING: 7
I like this game; however, I’m buying a timer to put in the box. Two of our players wanted to write down the entire content of each card, which meant that the phase for reading the cards took so long that two other players who finished quickly would start side conversations each round. Fair enough, but more time was taken getting the conversationalists focused back on the game each round. The conversationalists are good people and considerate gamers, but their conversations were of a slightly meatier nature that were difficult to break off in the middle without wrapping them up first.

So, the game took nearly three times as long as it should have. I’m amazed that I can see the potential for an engaging game after all that, but it’s definitely there...if I buy a big sandtimer to limit the evidence phase of the game and keep it running on track.

A coma disguised as a game, but without the drama of whether you might wake up. 

This risible exercise in crushing tedium basically boils down to reading a collection of short paragraphs and then trying to guess the solution. There's virtually no game. Yes, you can bid off to go to the same space as someone else, but there's rarely any reason to. I like almost all games, but if I never see Watson & Holmes again, it will be a lifetime too soon. 

Save yourself two painful, gruelling hours and just read the cards at the outset, then go and watch a film while everyone else dies slowly at the table.

Deduction. Really enjoyed my one play of this. Unlike "Clue" type games in which there is a known pool of target items (who, what, where, for example) that is whittled down by process of elimination, this one features the actual piecing together of information while visiting different people and places in the scenario, complete with taking your own notes on what you think is important so you can answer the questions required to win.

Very cool.

Edit: just got Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective, so need to try that out. Although I think that is strictly co-op while this is competitive.

I want to like this more. I think the cases are extremely well-done, and the art is really nice. You definitely feel like you're part of a Sherlock Holmes story. I like bidding games, and bluffing-style games, which are the key mechanics here for determining which locations to go to and when to ask for someone to read their clue aloud or to place a police barricade. The problem for me is that I didn't like both of these elements being in place in the same game. I appreciate the Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective, as a pure co-op to use the deduction to solve the mystery. Here, it seems that the jockeying for position to get the information overshadows the deduction element, and so it's a frustratingly tense management of which information you get rather than a competition about your deductive abilities, which is what I think this game was trying to be.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I think I liked this more than I should.  The mechanics are only okay, and waiting for people to write down their notes is a drag.  Still, the deduction elements had me wanting to play more cases.  Supposedly, the mechanics have some more interesting elements in later cases.  It's certainly not as good as Sherlock Holmes: CD, but it can be played in less time, and there are only so many cases of SH:CD.

Loving it. Take Consulting Detective and turns it into a competitive experience. During the game, everyone sits in silence scribbling notes, and then as soon as someone gets the answer everyone immediately blurts out their own story of what just happened.

RATING: 8
Let me start by saying I hate deduction games. I find them tedious, repetitive and not at all interesting as they are either a simple exercise in basic logic or simple efficient set collection both of which are not very interesting mechanics.

Now still I do rate this game an 8, while it is clearly a game I should hate. Why? Because this game mixes the inevitable deduction mechanic with a great story. You are racing with other inspectors to most efficiently solve a case and that is EXACTLY how this game feels. Besides for the always great Sherlock Holmes theme it lets you decide for yourself which location you want to go to without some tedious spatial movement so many of these games possess. At that location, there is a mechanic to come in big and pushing the other investigator to some less interesting location (to you, at that moment, at least). So there's that.
Also, there is this tactical 'Dr Watson' mechanic which allows you to force other players to share their findings of a specific location with everyone should you deem it beneficial. Also, there is a very thematic 'Police zone' card in which you can seal off a location so no other investigator is allowed there (to tamper with your evidence, mind you). All of these are great little mechanics which not only lead you towards solving the case, but to make sure you can report back the fastest as well.

Where the game really shines is in the overload of information. You get so many false leads and clues that it is challenging to pick out the right things to go on. And if you are inefficient, this will force you back to a location already visited, wasting valuable turns in the process. After all, only the first investigator to answer all questions will be the winner.

In the end, replayability of this game will not be that much due to the limited number of stories, but for the time being it will keep you highly involved, something which I will take any time over a highly replayable but bland deduction game. 

Accessible yet highly thematic excellent deduction game. Recommended!

As someone that has played and enjoyed Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective, I don't see how Watson & Holmes is anything but a strictly worse version of that.  W&H is like each person is playing their own solo game of SH:CD, except once you finish reading your clue you have to stop and wait for everyone else to finish reading their clue.  There is an auction-style mechanic to determine which location you go to, but for the most part there are plenty of locations and it didn't get too competitive.  

There is also a Watson card where you can force one person to read their clue out loud.  That person gets shafted and it's largely arbitrary.  That extra semi-random "take that" aspect is not something I like in multiplayer games.

Lastly, to win the game you need to guess 3 questions correctly.  But, the questions can be quite vague and you don't know exactly what they are looking for.  Unlike SH:CD where a vague question just means you lose a point or half a point, in W&H if you get one question slightly wrong you are effectively eliminated for the rest of the game.

All in all, it feels like they took SH:CD and added elements that only make the game worse.  I can see how some people that dislike co-ops would enjoy this more, but IMO the whole point of puzzle solving and deduction is the collaboration and discussion.

Haven't played the game yet, but I need to give a warning about the price.

I picked up the Asmodee edition for $20 on Amazon. The game has a $60 MSRP. When you open the box you see two decks of oversized cards and a number of cardboard tokens. That's it.

If the game is good then $20 seems fair enough for what you get, but I can't imagine paying $60 for this game and not being incredibly disappointed. It's important to not buy a game like this at full price as a way to tell Asmodee that their pricing is getting out of control.

I feared that the cases would be very linear and obvious compared to Consulting Detective, but I haven't found that to be the case through 5 "easy" cases.

In fact getting all the answers 100% right is hard enough that the competitive part of the game borders on unnecessary.

However I do appreciate how they managed to hammer Consulting Detective into a coherent competitive game.  

Great component quality, particularly in the new edition too.  Well done, I'd buy expansions for it.

First Impression:

Take the amazing Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective boardgame. Gut each case book to a few pages to fit it into cards. Gut its cooperative "pure case solving" gameplay to competitive "a bit guessing, a bit bluffing, a bit bidding and ok, a bit solving as well". Gut the awesome theme of being a detective to being a jerk that hampers an investigation to feed his ego. Gut the whole atmosphere of talking, sharing ideas, discussing clues over the table to pure mute. Oh, and add some special character abilities to make it look cool.

Even all that effort can't really crash a board game down to 0. That's how good Sherlock Holmes consulting detective is!

This game took 3-4 hours for the basic level 0 game and we probably said 20 words between each other the entire time. Part of it was we didn't take near enough notes so it dragged out a bit.  

If you like playing solitaire in the same room with each other then this is a great game.  If you actually like talking and interacting with each other then pass as there is next to no player interaction.  

Why this game wasn't coop i have no idea that would have made this game infinitely better, the fact you're all competing to solve the case first ruins it. Especially since if you guess wrong you have to help the other players by giving them partial answers, which why i would want to help them win is beyond me.

I decided to check this one out because a friend recommended it to me, and because I'm so fond of Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective. This game is not cooperative though, as every player wants to be the first to solve the case. The game adds a bidding element and you can use carriages to block your opponents from visiting certain locations. In our first game however, there wasn't a lot of that going on, because carriages are important towards the end of the game, and because everyone was focused on their own solution and needed to visit at least 10 out of a possible 12 locations. Solving the case is the fun part about this game though, so I'll keep it until I've played all of the scenarios.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Deduction game comes with 12 cases. Its a race to be first to figure out the 3 questions of the case.  Players visit the central display of card locations that may or may not contain relevant clues. Use carriage tokens in a bump auction to pick these locations. Blockade tokens add a wonderful bluff and deter mechanic to impair, false lead, or misdirect the others. Break blockades with search warrants from Scotland yard or using lock picks. Get help from your special assistant. Elegant game play allows players to spend their time sorting the complex clue relationships. Demo'd at Essen. Some of the clues are long and not the greatest crime solver but I still have fun. I love the "chase" feeling of the game afoot, love bump auctions, and love-love the bluff opportunities from using (not using) blockade tokens and throwing verbal or non-verbal "tells".

I have the 1991 Mayfair version, SOMEWHERE!  I bought it a long time ago when I was really into Magic and wanted to see the game that partially inspired it.  I remember playing once or twice, but board games weren't really my thing back then, so I'm hoping I can find it and get a few plays in before rating it.  I'm not really sure where it is--probably floating around somewhere at my parent's house.  

[update] I would really like to play this more, but I can't seem to find the right group for it.  At Origins someone was playing with Euro cubes instead of the flimsy paper, and I think that's a brilliant idea I should copy.  

Have acquired both More Cosmic Encounter and Simply Cosmic, I believe I have the complete Mayfair CE.  I've also been playing the base game a lot more often--I love it.  The base game offers so much variety and is so easy to play that I don't know when I'd ever feel the urge to include the expansions.

This game was fun due to the shit-talking, yelling, laughing, etc. that occurred while playing. However, the game can feel kind of confounding as the game sometimes seems to slip totally out of your control. I would happily play again, but I have no need to pick up a copy. Internet play could be the way to go with this one.

Brilliant game. If you have the Mayfair edition, play kickers when you'd play reinforcements. More fun. Use the Kicker x1 like the Butler flare from the EON set. It allows you to put one token per challenge into the warp. If you're caught, it comes out, and the person you were doing it to flooshes two of your tokens, and you lose the flare.

I loved this for the first 20 or so plays.  (Would have rated it an 8)  Must be played with exactly 4 players. Is most enjoyable when played with non-gamers or while very tired and unable to think.

RATING: 7
A little chaotic for my tastes (And yeah, I understand that the chaos is the *point* of the game). When it first came out, I was put off by the number of expansions (not to mention the silliness of some of them. Particularly disliked lucre and moons). And yet, still worth playing after all these years. Almost everyone that I know who games seems to own a copy of this from some company or other.

This has a 10 primarily for historical reasons - it was one of my first boardgames, and I adored it. It was lent for the longest time, now I'm waiting for a right moment to spring it on my game group (i.e. a big enough crowd in the mood for some wackiness). I love the chaos brought on by multiple powers - I had most fun with 5 powers per player, and everyone needs to negotiate me down to two or so before each play. Awesome stuff.

I can now see what all the fuss in about and why this game has persevered for so long and through many printings and expansions.  This is fine negotiation game with special powers.  It may be too random for a good portion of the Geeks populance but I have no problem at all with and I'm fine with the go-with-the-flow nature of the game.  I all the 4 and 5 player games I've played everyone was just as likely to win and it was always a close game.

I wish I could have played this when it was first around. I'm sure I would have enjoyed it. It was fun but I think there are now better space conflict games around. Starcraft and TI for example.

After playing the Fantasy Flight reprint a few times I have started to like this game. It is not the game I originally thought and is just a mad negotiation, chaos fest of awesome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The granddaddy of them all. Original Cosmic is often considered the beginning of hobby games and even the root origin of Magic: the Gathering CCG. If you haven't played this game, you owe it to yourself to play at least one version of it. It's possible you may not like it, but you will be less for the experience if you don't play it at least once. Base game is OK, but the expansions open this game up to a whole new level.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
i can certainly understand the past appeal.  i only played it for the first time in 2006, and i can clearly see the variable player power influence on stuff like magic: the gathering.  i found the game somewhat enjoyable because of the special abilities and their interactions, but the core game struck me as clunky and uninteresting.  it makes me look even more forward to trying dune.

RATING: 7
Variants make this game fun - two powers, house rule moons, or to go all out, try "cosmic encounter croquet with funny hats in the front yard".  Sci-fi theme is fun, complete with history and brief description of your powers to boot.  Must be played with the right people.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Play several games in a row and see it take off. The first game new players are likely to make silly mistakes and the fun subtleties will be missed. The second play, everyone will be more in tune with the negotiation, card management, and player reading, making it a better game for all. Third play, people will be hooked.

It doesn't sound very good, but it plays well regardless.  It's more about playing to the randomly chosen set of odd powers that each player gets than really getting much kick out of actually winning.  It's like an RPG game where you can get crappy stat rolls, but you can still play your unbalanced character to annoy the other people.

I want to buy the 1977 game and all 12 of the expansion packs that I had, somewhere around 1982.  I'm just a newly hired school teacher, so I'm fine with a cheaper price rather than a new-in-box condition.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.9
Okay, so I am very aware that we didn't play this one as it should be played. I'm certain this grade will rise very muchly after another play, but this is based on the first play we did. Everyone was too concerned with the rules and how everything worked, and not at all watching anyone else, and all of a sudden after five turns one player won (because she was in on all the five encounters).

Essentially a negotiation game where players have assymetrical powers. The basic game plays fairly quickly, just long enough considering the luck of the draw in the attack and edict cards and chaos of the battles. The numerous races and special powers ensure quite a bit of replayability out of the system.

For some odd reason many of the people I game with rarely have any interest in playing this game.

For a game collector, this is a absolute must have game.

RATING: 6
Interesting game, it has lots of critical decisions, a huge amount of scope and great replayability. However, the game seems overly long and rather arbitrary, two elements that I don't much appreciate.

This entry also includes the card game Cosmic: The Encounter, which in most elements is almost identical to the board game. In my oppinion the differences improve the game. 'Seeking your Destiny' has much more control in Cosmic: The Encounter, and when the rules are tidied up and the players know the game it should play much faster than the board game. My rating for Cosmic: The Encounter is a 7
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Have the AH version, only played the online version, which is very quick. People moan about how AH stripped all the greatness out of this game for their version. I've never played the Eon version but I like the AH version just fine. I can't really miss what I never had right?

Okay variable player powers game, but the constant negotiation of alliances (for single battles) annoys me.  Some powers (e.g. Zombie) seem unbalanced.  Also, I don't find the gameplay to be very interesting.

I've only played the old Games Workshop version that Miguel bought for 25p. Not that familiar after 2 plays and there's more to this that we dug up in that time, so further plays may revise my opinion of this. It's an OK game with plenty or strategy and a bewildering array of ruiles breaker powers that can totally amend how you think the game is going to pan out.

Due to Games Workshop's recent decision to force BGG to remove most files supporting this and other GW games, I have removed my "6.5" ranking from this game. I no longer wish to contribute to the game's ranking here on BGG.

Maybe I've played it with the wrong type of gamers, but I just don't get this one at all :(

Where to start? Seems to have all the elements I hate in a game, and the resulting mix isn't much fun. Attacks are random (fact you draw them from a strategy deck is laughable), blind bidding for combat resolution. Then add in buckets of chaos from edicts and special powers.

Wouldn't expect the game to be 'balanced' as the idea is players interact - but this goes to such an extreme kingmaking is the game ... group decides who wins. So is it a game or a popularity contest?

Add in what seems to me excessive downtime (but that's probably because I don't 'get' the game and what for me is 'downtime' IS the game for others), and you have something I don't want to play.

*** Update, talked into playing - bleugh ... still don't get this - never want to play it again, dropped the rating to 2.

I have the AH(Hasbro) version. Sadly this one only supports 4 players. As this is to a large degree a diplomacy game it could be more interresting with more players.
It seems the experiance strongly varies (partially of course depending on the mood of the gamers). Some games can be great, but nearly half of the games I played where average/slightly dull.
As mentioned this is more of adiplomatic/social game. Don´t play it expecting heated space battles...

One of the first games of variable player powers.  Due to a number of factors (the variety of alien power combinations and flares among them), this one should have high replay value.  Suffers a bit from luck-of-the-draw (alien power, seating order, hand of cards, and the cone of destiny are all random), but the game seems more-or-less self-balancing.  I'd be happy to play this one again.

I used to own the Games Workshop version years ago but couldn't work out the balancing aspects of the various powers.  The new AH version doesn't address this all that much -- but I can see how player interaction can effectively level the field between the inherently imbalanced races.  Now I need just to convince my players as well that it really does work; their own experiences, from years ago, were much the same as mine. EDIT: I've since played the new FF version - and it hasn't improved my own opinion of the game. (Rating drops.)

Ah, the stories I could tell of lost afternoons and evenings playing this game.  No two games ever turn out the same if you're properly mixing in only a few of the expansion powers each game.

I like the variably powered aliens.  They're fun and add a bit of variety to what is otherwise a fairly dull excursion.  Maybe I haven't played with hard core negotiation types, but I have the feeling that even if I were the game still wouldn't be that fantastic.  The order chips tell you which system you have to attack in even if it gives you the option of who to attack.  The closer you get to winning, the more spread out you become and the less likely it will be that you attract allies.  This causes the game to turn into a sort of stalemate situation where nobody can really do a whole lot and everyone sits around waiting to see who will draw the opportunity to attack a weak planet occupied by a weak player.

RATING: 3
Bleh!!  I just don't get what all the fuss is about.  It seemed like random crap to me.  It seemed like I was playing mini games of war, the card game I played as a 5 year old, except with special powers that made it even more pointless.  Even when you do win, someone can just throw a card down that makes you lose anyways. This is especially true when you're trying to win the game by claiming your 5th base, at which point is becomes a bash the leader contest. 

The deal making in this game can be especially odd.  It always resulted in useless deals that were made only to avoid the penalty for not making a deal.

At the end of this day, this style of game is just not for me.  I don't care for negotiation, I don't care for bluffing, and I don't care much for emergent partnerships.  This game contains all of these elements, so if they're up your alley, you may enjoy the game much more than I did!

The first and best forever.  Some in my group can't get over the relative 'unequal' powers (I agree that Chronos is too powerful) but I love it.  Definitely a game to be played more than once in a night.  The online version is great (and a quick game) too!

RATING: 9.1
Games plays best with the flares cards.  Only the Eon (expansions #4 and #8) and the Mayfair versions have flares. The other ones don't, so they are not worth getting.  I have the Eon + 9 expansions, Mayfair + expansion, Games Workshop, and Avalon versions, and even a German version.  The Avalon version was released without the expansions (ie, no flares), and is essentially the basic Eon set.  Get the Eon (with flares) or Mayfair versions if you can find them.

The theme, the alien races and their powers are fun. It is fun to imagine a nice game of Cosmic Encounter, but it often turned out to be very boring to play: It just depends on the initial distribution of powers too much. Depending on which alien races are in play, you might have a huge head start or no chance at all. Since my gaming evenings have become to scarce (3-4 per month), I won't risk my valuable gaming time with this one anymore.

Your race is in peril. To survive, your alien life form must spread five colonies to other star systems. Fleets of spaceships, willpower, guile, and a bit of tricky card play are the tools at your command. Those, and your special alien power! Using your power lets you bend, mutilate, or break one rule of the game in a specific way. But beware -- all of the other aliens in the game have their own special powers, every game is sure to be different and exciting.

Rating is for the new "Avalon Hill" edition:  This was one of the earlier games I purchased which got me back into gaming.  Prior to this my boardgames consisted of things like Shogun, Risk, and Monopoly.  I had heard about Cosmic Encounter from long ago in my AD&D hayday but passed up a chance to own the earlier editions (with much regret).  Anyway, I really enjoyed playing this game and it saw a lot of action, but then I was opened up to a new world of board games and I haven't touched it since.  It's still a fun game, but from what I've heard the original versions are much better.  Would love to have a go at those!  There is a new online version, but I really think player interaction is a lot of the fun on this one.

 Loved it in my adolescence, but I'm the type of person that likes variant player powers and more options / abilities - if someone could figure out a variant that would allow a player to use / choose additional powers during the game (besides everyone starting out with multiple powers), then I would push harder to get this game out on the table.

The one time I've played this was with an original 1977 copy and I must say that the names of the races and some of their powers were entertaining to read. The art was so 70's that it was just awesome, and the big "vortex" tunnel piece is so ridiculous that it's endearing. 

I was originally dissatisfied with this game - partly because I approached it expecting it to be a particular kind of game. In other words, I thought I was going to get a more strategic game. Instead, this is more of a light-hearted game that isn't meant to be played with an uber-serious attitude. Looking at it that way, I've decided to remove my rating until I've had a chance to play it again.

I respect Cosmic Encounter more than I like it. Not all the alien powers are equal...which gives you a fun and varied gameplay in the same sense as roleplaying.  Despite what some say, I don't think all players start with an equal chance of winning, which may bug a few people.  Its about negotiation and creativity...which I think is neat. I guess the thing that is less appealing to me is that CE just feels a little bit too chaotic.I would happily play it if someone in the group wanted to, but I don't know if I would pull it out of my closet on my own very often.

This has been my #1 game for over 25 years, and I still don't see that changing any time soon!  I love the ordered chaos of Cosmic's near-infinite gaming universe.  Everyone is always in the game and always has a chance.  And every game is different since there are so many powers available.  Unfortunately, I'm hardly ever able to get this game to the table.  There are so many other great games to choose from these days, and thus greater competition for gaming time.  This game is best when all the players have a few games under their belt and have learned some of the strategies.  Also, you need 4-6 players for the best game, and you really should be using flares.  Play with the Eon or Mayfair editions!  The Avalon Hill version is too limited.

I bought the Hasbro version because I had fond (but vague) memories of playing one of the earlier versions years ago.  I was a bit put off by the plastic pieces, but didn&#039;t feel like paying auction prices for an &quot;authentic&quot; version.  I shouldn&#039;t have bothered- what fun was left in a game that is now rather dated is soiled by the slick, overdone presentation.

This may be my most played game of all time. I have played this over 100 times from 1977-1980. The expansions killed it for me. The base game and the first two expansions were all that were needed. They should have stopped there.

The Avalon Hill version can be considered Cosmic Lite.  It is so crippled as to be useless (but the bits are pretty...  Bits are not very usable, should be replaced
with simpler things)

I have played Mayfair, much better than AH.

I have played ION, with all the expansions and the 300+ aliens the the Framingham group made.  I actually played at the Framingham group.  This house is DEDICATED to gaming, it is wicked odd (in a good way).

Overall, I consider it a wash between ION and MayFair.  I consider the Framingham Group Aliens essential.  Both ION and MayFair versions are out of print, and expensive on eBay.

Have the Games Workshop Edition (32 aliens 2-6 players)which I recently received in trade. Had one play so far. Played it totally wrong rules wise but we had a blast. It is a very social game with lots of interaction and negotiation. It had us laughing and arguing as a family. Very quickly we appreciated the imbalance of some of the alien powers. This aids the negotiation element of the game. The kids loved it (11 and 14) which always makes it a winner in my book as without them some 3+ player games rarely make it to the table.

Mayfair version with parts of add-ons.  Started playing in early 90s.. still sees the table more than half of game nights.  Endless variation, love those logical discussions on how powers interact.  We joke that we might as well give everyone four planets and start from there.. love it anyway.

A true classic.  Currently own Mayfair edition (with More Cosmic Encounter).  Originally got the Eon edition as a birthday present back in '78 (intrigued by the ad in Games magazine!), traded away about 15 years ago, and regretted it, so ebay'd a Mayfair version for a semi-reasonable price.  :-)

Man, I hear rumors that there used to be like 100 races for this game.  I love how the simple rules tweaks each race have turn a simple mecahanic in to a deep interaction game.  However, the more you get in to it, the more you wish for something more.  It is almost formulaic around the tenth play.

RATING: 6
I found this at a flea market not knowing much about it, but it looked cool and so I picked it up. I've been very excited to play it, but very few plays have been worthwhile. One play with experienced players was very fun, but every time I have tried with beginners, even though they're big gamers, it has pretty much flopped, usually due to confusion over when/how alien powers can be used. Perhaps I'm lousy at explaining games? Or perhaps the alien powers are a tad daunting to learn? I'm still convinced this game is a gem, but until I get more enjoyment out of it, I will have to give it a more modest rating. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Possibly the greatest board game ever created, I have the Mayfair version of CE.  I also bought the "More Cosmic" expansion, but with all the different ways the alien powers can interplay in the original game, my group has never even bothered with the expansion.  I keep telling them that as soon as we've tried all nine billion possible alien powers combinations in the original game, we could move on to the expansion.  Wonderful, wonderful game!

I've heard about it for years... and now I've finally played it a few times and I feel just lukewarm about it. I like the variable powers. I like the deal making. I don't like the lack of control over who attacks who. I don't like the imbalanced powers. A game whose time has maybe passed... but I'll try this again for sure. My first few plays were with 2 powers - this may be better with 1.

Don't recall which version of Cosmic Encounter I played with. There are so many of them. Probably was a good board game in the when it came out, but today with the choices of games out there, it didn't age very well.

When I played it for the first time, I didn't really liked it. The only thing I liked about this game is that it's area control. I generally enjoy that type of mechanic in a board game. Cosmic Encounter didn't make me feel that I had to play again.

Cosmic Encounter is rather random. Some races are better than others. In some cases, like the game which I played, I had an easy win due to the power I had. I had some kind of alien race which was super powerful compared to the other players.

There is very little control or balance. A game can last a bit longer than expected. I know this game is popular with some people, but I can't seem the reason why.

I don't plan to play Cosmic Encounter any time soon.

There are too many better games out there that playing this game on a regular basis is a waste of time.

RATING: 10
Perfection... I like player powers, I like game elements that break the rules just for you and gives you a unique edge in the game.  The game was built on this premise and that satifies me tremendously.

It has has heaps of player interaction.  Each turn there is the possibility that you can get involved and either postively benefit from another player's turn or screw over someone else.  Because of this the downtime is rather minimal.  If you have a lot of people playing the game then it might be quite awhile before your turn comes around again, but I've seen people advance very far without having their turn pop up.

The core element of the game is the challenge and the toothy grins each player makes as they select their cards to reveal is a wonderful giggly bluffing match.  Sure it's chaotic, but its the mix of bluffing, negotiation and analysis of powers that help balance things out with player detente.

The downsides to the game are that it can be chaotic, it can take several hours to play if people don't want to have a shared victory, and you do need to learn the game a bit more than some types of games to do well.  There are a lot of different powers in the game and so having a good working knowledge of what is possible is required unless everyone is a newbie.

RATING: 7
Cosmic Encounter has stood the test of time and for good reason. The game is littered with deduction and mind games, and not as negotiation heavy as I had imagined. Additionally, where most game's strive for balance, Cosmic Encounter is proudly the opposite. The various races, and flare card, vary wildly in strength, but this power imbalance fosters early targets. While 'The Void' may well be the most powerful race, you'd best believe everyone else knows that and will target that player until they are on equal footing. Granted this purposeful imbalance can produce some king-making scenarios, it never goes so far as to be self-destructive.

Rating after first play. Rating will most likely go up in future plays. This was more an experience than game. Amazing first play (that I think I took last in by the way). 

After two more plays, this game has been put down to a 7 in my book. I respect the game for everything it is, and everything it has contributed to gaming, but it feels kind of clunky and dated for euro standards. 

Update: It took a seasoned Ameritrasher to convince me that Cosmic Encounter is nothing more than a super-random game of unbalanced powers. I still see the irony in this, but damnit he's right. I sold my copy and I don't think I'll play this title again - I do have good memories of a couple plays though.

Played the Avalon Hill game with Eon roles, and I'm not totally sure I get it.  So I was amused when I read through the game comments and saw many people saying "I don't get it".

There just isn't anything to DO in this one.  The fun supposedly comes from role-playing aspects, but I'd think you could play Caylus with a colander on your head and speaking in a funny voice and get the same experience except with some actual decisions to make.

The hand management and alliance systems present no meaningful choices.  I'd try another version to see if the AH game was really missing something important.

Mayfair Edition.  Players represent alien races that are seeking to spread themselves onto five foreign worlds. To accomplish this, they make challenges against other players and enlist the aid of interested parties. But all that would be boring without alien powers, which are unique to each race. The alien powers give players ways to bend or outright break some rule in the game...

[Special powers, area control, negotiation, wargame] {Hasbro version} Chaos and randomness personified. If you're looking for control, you won't find it here. If you're looking for game balance, you won't find it here either (that's not a knock on the game - it's CE's nature). Basically a game of special powers, area control and interference. The card draws can be painful, and the bash the leader effect can make the game easily outstay its welcome. The Hasbro edition is damned pretty, but it can't overcome the feeling of helplessness at making events go one way or another.

One of my favorite board games ever. Silly, fast-paced, tons of variety that makes every game different. But also loads of interesting player interaction (very little downtime in CE), deep strategies, and some really intense bluffing. This game really has it all.

Eon Edition.  Trade as part of complete Eon set.

In my top 10 all time.  How can you not like a game that lets you break the rules, screw your opponent one second and be his ally the next, and never plays the same twice?  Besides, it's one of the sexiest looking games ever invented.  Fun, fun, fun.

RATING: 10
To put it simply, awesome game. The combinations and situations that arise never cease to amaze me. Personally, i love the balance in the game between skill and luck. It seems the majority of our games have the more experienced players winning about sixty to seventy per cent of the time, but new players still have a good chance of winning. The diplomacy aspect in the game helps to shake things up a little. To me, the fact that half the powers are more or less powerful than the others makes the game far more interesting, it's great to win a game in which you had the weakest or least used combination of abilities.

RATING: 4
Transposed rating from the FFG reprint. I feel my rating & comment is equally valid for the older game.

The way we played I have to rate this a 4. It barely made it once around the table, powers seemed hard to use intelligently, and the game was basically decided on card draw... With two players winning (including me). Maybe we got some rules wrong? Otherwise I can't see why this game is enjoying such a cult following...


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I played the EON version of C.E. hundreds of times as a teenager. Combined with expansions 1-4 and 6-8, this was an incredibly fun game due to the variability (which powers in play), numerous decisions, and having most players involved at all times.

This game was not deep. With the expansions, it had some amusing theoretical flaws like the possibility everyone could simultaneously win or game could get stuck in an infinite loop. And it had deeper flaws in terms of power balance (i.e. Mesmer was too powerful in the hands of experienced players when flares in play). But this game introduced several new innovations in game design which inspired countless games over the next few decades, including Magic the Gathering.

I was thinking of only rating this 9 because it's boring without at least the first 4 expansions. But the expansions were so cheap (about $5 each) that you could get the game and all the expansions for around $60. Given all the fun I had with this game, I have to rate it 10.

The bluffing part and hand management of the card play is pretty good, and the various power are great fun, but I can't easily get over the random assignment of attack targets. And there's no dramatic progression, we're always all a little surprised when someone wins, like "Oh, yeah you win. Wait, that's it?". To be fait, we played it a lot at some point so there may be some burnout effect going on, but I just wouldn't be very interested in playing it again.

After only one play, I can sense that this could become, with the right group, one of the great ones. 1977 Eon. 

Update: My intuition was right. Cosmic Encounter is heavenly bliss. Bumped up the rating.

Update: Having now experienced Dune, must lower rating a bit. Dune surpasses Cosmic Encounter in most every way. But CE is the lighter, take-that, beer-and-pretzels Dune. It also can be a bit Munchkiny, if too many expansions are thrown into the mix. I tend to prefer my CE served straight and up.

I've played both the old version and the new AH version several times.  When I read about this game, I was very intrigued and excited, since so many people love it so much.  Now that I've played it, I have to say that it was a big let-down.

In the old version, there is so much going on with all the expansions, it's way out of hand.  There's not much game left there, just a lot of negotiating back and forth and deciphering rule interactions.  The last two times I played were 6-player games that ended in ties!  Ridiculous, and no thanks.  My impression is that people love how there are so many expansions, and love all the moving parts in the game, blinding them to the fact that this is not a good game.  Magic comparisons are applicable here.

With the new AH version, the game is trimmed down, so you would expect that they would be able to clean up and cover all the rule contradictions.  Nope.  In our final game before I got rid of it, the game ground to a halt on the first turn, when two of the powers were found to have mutually exclusive effects.  The resolution of this conflict was not covered in the rulebook, so we just quit the game.

Remains the king of the "special powers" games.  The chaos and unpredictablilty that results from the interactions of the various powers and flares is what keeps this game fresh after 25 years.  If you have only played the Hasbro/Avalon Hill version, you owe it to yourself to try one of the editions with flares and a greater selection of alien powers.  I play modified Eon rules (which means re-usable flares), preferably with exactly five players.

Brilliant. Combinations of powers lead to very different games; I've played 6 hour marathons ending in 5 way ties, as well as winning the game before it came to be my turn. Even in extremely unbalanced games, there's a real delight in thinking up a good move. Expansions -- all the powers, lucre and the extra cards are good (including kickers). Flares, moons, and reverse hexes aren't necessary, but can add a bit of flavour.

An original game.  Not at all a wargame, despite my original impressions.  It's heavily based on luck, and probably the most shockingly unbalanced game I've ever played.  Still, if you're going to play a luck-based, unbalanced game, go for Cosmic.  It's just too bad that most of the things that make the game so unique are also its greatest downfalls.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A good game, but commonly over-rated. Its greatest strength (the various alien powers) can also be its greatest weakness. A modest amount of chaos results in a fine game, but too often it's overwhelming and the game becomes a mess.

This is especially problematic with aficionados who love to make the game as chaotic as possible. I recommend playing with the simpler aliens as much as possible.

Prefer the Mayfair edition (since I haven't seen most of the aliens from the various Eon expansions.)  Great variety of strategy keeps me interested.  One alien may work well against several other aliens, but the next game with the same alien can be an entirely different experience.

I finally played the game again playing a set that included the Eon and Mayfair editions and found it enjoyable again.

Most of my plays of late have been of a set that is Mayfair AND Eon mixed together as they are compatible with each other.  So, all my data should be considered as for both now that they split the nearly identical editions into two entries.

Well, have 2 German Versions of this one. I was so glad to get it, after I played it as a kid, many years ago and had so much fun that one - but this fun seems to be left behind in those days. Well, might be a classic (it definitely is!) - but not for me. Card values vary so extreme, that inviting is &#039;nice&#039; but not a real must. (All might be different when you play with 6 - but I have quiet never the chance anymore to get 6 fellows onto one table).

It's not a bad game, but it is a game you have to be familiar with to enjoy. Learning the rules is easy, but the ability to devise a workable strategy requires an understanding of each of the characters' attributes. In other words, unless you can find a few players that want to endure the learning curve, it might end up sitting on your shelf for a while.

Update: Mayfair's Simply Cosmic was the only boardgame small enough to bother taking with me on vacation in Panama. As a result, it was played often and the afore mentioned familiarity achieved. Better and better with each repeated play.

Our group of friends in college played the Mayfair edition of CE until the pieces fell apart.  I like the fact that the game is very scalable.  You can play a quick, straightforward game with the newbies or you can go crazy with loads of powers and flares.  CE was also the first game I had ever played that allowed for several players to share a victory.  Since I adore games that allow for bluffing and back-stabbing, CE will always make my top five.

RATING: 6.5
This is a bizarre game.  The deep level of randomness and the insane power of some cards makes it less of a traditional board game and more of a framework for loose role-playing liek gameplay.  The interaction between players, alliance building and general silliness seems to provide greater entertainment than actually winning.  Make no mistakes, there is clearly strategy involved, but I don't think it is entirely critical to the experience. I do like that the basic rules are simple, although i am challeneged by all the radical modifiers and a lack of obvious hierarchy to applying overlapping effects.

I played John's Mayfair edition copy at Mike's house.

A great game with what looks like tons and tons of options, combinations, and permutations that will keep it infinately interesting. I've only played it a couple of times but am looking forward to playing it again many more times (maybe I'll raise my rating as I see more of it) -- I played the old Eon version with all of the expansions and was really dissapointed (but not surprised) that Hasbro bungled the new version by having such limited options.

The game that breaks its own rules. If nothing else, CE rarely gets boring because every game is different due to each player having special powers that change the way the rules work. Not complicated by any means, CE is a nice diversion. One of those games that someone wins and everyone says &#039;huh? how did *you* win?&quot;.

RATING: 6
An archetypal teenagers' game in that there's lots of fun and table talk, but no real way to win, other than by stealth or outrageous good fortune. The special alien powers aren't even remotely fair or balanced, but negotiation is expected to make up the difference and how successful that is will depend on the nature of the players. I must admit, it has a certain something that draws you in, and it's the closest thing to Diplomacy you can play in an hour, but overall this is a seventies game starting to show its age.

Simple mechanics lead to frenzied confusion - especially if any multi-power variants are used.  Slippery pieces you can&#039;t pick up.  The only game I know with a Hyperspace Cone.  This is my top desert island game (if I were stranded with five other game-players!)

I remember disliking this when I played it back in the early 1980s ago.  Some time around 2005 Thomas persuaded me to give it another try, and it was even worse than I remembered.  The game mechanism is lame and stupid, and all the business of special powers which is supposed to be so intriguing is in fact just a big hassle.  It'll be another 25 years before I try this again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The rules (in our Mayfair Games edition) are humourously written, and a fun read. Unfortunately the game itself is not such fun. The game is such that other players find it fairly easy to stop each other getting the last of 5 points, meaning everyone typically gets to 4. The winner is then ultimately determined by luck more than skill, and the playing time is unfortunately not short enough to justify such a random result. Nor does the game provide many meaningful choices to be made.

Rated for the mayfair version of the game. . .just wonderful.  The sheer amount of alien powers.  The only downside to this game (And the reason it didnt get a 10) is that sometimes you end up with that alien power that doesnt do anything real beneficial to you when you combine it with your oppenents powers (But this doesnt happen too often).  Would Really, really, like to get my hands on a copy of this game for a price thats less than the cost of surgery!

I am sure this is much much better FTF, it is a fairly simple game to play with very little strategy but there are some good tactical decisions to make. The fun of it comes from playing the roles of the aliens and ganging up on someone. Making alliances is also fun and, well, breaking the alliance is even more fun....hehe... all the facial expressions, bluffing and cursing is lost on the computer unfortunately, this probably rates around an 8 FTF

 Not a bad game but I have never been a big fan of players having different types of powers as sometimes the powers seem unbalanced. Probably with more plays I might enjoy it more. I have the version that is for 2-4 players only without expansions. 3 players might be ok but probably need to play with 4 players to enjoy it more.

(And it's not just a matter of writing the same rules more clearly. Much was actually cleaned up.)

**NOSTALGIA RATING**

Cosmic Encounters itself is not a heavy game, it's a game of chaos and fun. Truly a fantastic game I intend to keep it forever, but Cosmic Encounter is player dependent and not for everyone. 

It is best face to face, it is best when played lightly and with humor. You must like messing with folk and enjoy being messed with (personally, I rather enjoy being messed with:) ).

Don't go looking for heay play, but play it for fun and enjoy the wild powers that directly affect game play.

I admire the open-ended nature of the design and I think that if I had started my gaming obsession back when this first came out, I would have been drawn to it.

One of my favourite ever games. Played it consistenly since it came out. Got most of the original expansions even the awful moons one, which just did not work.

The first play left me cold. If it wasn't such a cult game, I wouldn't even think about playing it again. But being popular 30 years after its development, there must be something to it which we all just didn't see. We always invited everybody else to the attack/defense, were too cooperative in the negotiations and always agreed to exchange colonies. In the end we all had four colonies and it was a matter of who got good enough cards first. We probably need to get more creative in negotiations and more than 4 players should improve the experience as well. I doubt that the game will get the chance to prove it.

I love Cosmic.  It was a game I had first played only a couple years ago-- the AH verison.  When I found out how old the game really was, and how much better Eon's version was, well... I was pulled right into the Void with it.  I think it really started me on the path to German gaming.  That, and hearing about Carcassone did me in.

One of the truely innovative board games that has helped to inspire and shape modern gaming.  It's a little clunky by modern standards, but is still very entertaining.  Everybody needs to be able to say that they've played Cosmic Encounter.  Waiting for the FFG version to finally own my own copy.

I loved this game 30+ years ago, and had all nine expansions, as well. The latest version from Fantasy Flight games is better, though. The quality of the EON components and art was hit or miss, and rules got extremely convoluted if you tried to play with all of the original expansions.

This game was seminal in shaping the way I thought of a space conquest game.  It strongly influence how I thought of traits as effectors to alter game-play.

I really really really hate it (played couple of times the finnish version 'Universumin valtiaat'). Ok, finnish edition has a very bad translation, but the game itself is bad one too. I don't like games which can take anything 30min->180min and Cosmic Encounter has this problem. It's a game where you need to kick the leader and that's all. Attack cards are too powerful, so the ships has only a minor role. OK, Cosmic Encounter is a "legend" or something but for me is just a great example of "oldies" which I don't care that much.

RATING: 9
My Mom, sister and I played for hours with this game when it came out.  We had *all* the expansions as they came out.  We didn't care if they were like $20 (and in the 70s and 80s that was a lot of money for a ziploc bag worth of components!)  

Unfortunately, during Hurricane Ike my roof leaked into son's closet.  All the expansions were in the box.  Total Loss!  It was hard to tell my Mom what happened - we were both heartbroken.

RATING: 2
I played the first edition of the game and I hated it. First, you have almost no control because you do not select you target player. Second, the number of  ship you send has really few importance because the attack cards can go from 4 to 30. Si it's not 4 additional troops than can make a huge difference. Third, some mechanics are just weird or does not make sense. Still, I don't have the special race ability. The fact that each race has really powerfull abilities does not bother me at all. It's more the flow of the game, the actions you can do and how some mechanics works that I hate. If helping players could also play cards it could bring a new dynamic to the game.

I made another review of cosmic encounter on a more recent game when I played my second game.

In overall, I realized that it would be more exciting to play snakes and ladder than playing cosmic encounter.

With optional rules, such as pick 3 powers play 2, and the right group, this game is a complete blast to play. I sold my copy for a ridiculous amount years ago. Fortunately, one of my gaming buddies rates this as his favorite game, so I know there will always be a copy available.

I know I'm supposed to love this game, but I've played multiple editions of it and none of them do much of anything for me. I just don't find it fun or interesting. Whenever I mention it I've been told I'm playing the wrong edition, or the wrong rules, or I need to add this element, or take away this element...I suspect the main thing is that to enjoy it I need to have fond memories of playing it for hours in my dorm room back in college.

Awesome. My Mayfair version sat in a box for a decade after many plays in college.  Played it again after many years in hiatus and it's better than I remembered,  Every time I play I get some idea for some other games.  One tip: Leave the Lucre and Lucre-based aliens in the box. Dune, Shadowfist and so many others started with this.

I used to play the brazilian version (Contatos Cósmicos) when I was a kid.

Avalon Hill Edition.

A lot of fun because of the forced interaction between the players.  Also, since the attacks are also forced there is no ability for the game to stall or for a player to turtle.

My only complaint is that some of the races are seen as more powerful than others which usually results in people gunning for you.  Of course, since you're more powerful you can kill them easier when they do.  :)

RATING: 10
Cosmic Encounter should be in the Gaming Hall of Fame. Up until it's release, games pretty much followed the same basic idea of having the same set of rules for everyone. CE broke that mold and gave birth to the idea of player specific abilities and/or rules.  Player's now had unique abilities that only THEY had the option of using and a new genre was born. Although certain combinations of Alien Powers may "unbalance" the game, there always seems to be SOME way to prevent a runaway victory and keep things close.  Cosmic Encounter presents players with a completely different level of strategy and tactics within the game because with so many powers available, the chances of having the same combinations appear in a game (ever?) are astronomical. In other words, your brilliant strategy from last game doesn't mean squat because not only are you most likely facing a completely different set of Alien Powers as opponents, your ability is different as well and figuring out the way to a victory is where all the fun lies. Some can't stand this type of chaos, but others (like myself) enjoy having to work out a new strategy to come up with a win.

Mayfair's version streamlined the playing and cleared up a lot of ambiguities and the changes from EON's version were for the best in my opinion (Timing rules, moon classification, one shot flares,  contradictory/super power combo's listed ect...).

My old gaming group had SO much fun with this one, I made parts to combine Cosmic Encounter with Simply Cosmic so we could play with up to 10 players at a time - using TWO Rotating Cones and having two players at a time take their turn. It was crazy but loads of fun. You can see pictures of that set-up in the game listing.

CE doesn't get pulled of the shelf as much as I'd like these days as my present gaming group are heavy wargamers and prefer to play something like Twilight Imperium instead of CE - although the race specific abilities in TI are a direct throwback to CE!

I give it a 10, possibly due to some nostalgia, but it is still a great game with a enthusiastic bunch - like at a convention!

The mayfair edition got a lot of play in highschool.  I'm not sure I'd enjoy it now, but it was a lot of fun at the time... kind of.  The winner seemed fairly random sometimes and many powers didn't jive with each other.  It had its time, but I don't think I'll play it again.

I've always had trouble selling this to my groups, but I like it. The gimmick of giving every player a rule-breaking power is enjoyable, and there's just the right amount of random weirdness to make it fun in different ways every time.

Cosmic also has a charmingly old school quality to it that I dig; I'm not sure if that carries over into the newer edition. We always take out the "end the game" moon, as that one seems particularly unsatisfying.

This is the Avalon Hill edition I have had it for a few years, and I loved it.

But for some reason they eliminated a lot of the more interesting alien races (how could you not include The Sniveler!) and added a lot of over-developed, useless plastic pieces.

Another of those I played quite a bit 'back in the day'. It's fun for what it is, but I've never been a big fan of negotiation games, nor of games with 'inevitable back-stab'. We played it with far too many expansions, before FFG took it over and rationalized it. I've played the FFG version just the once and that was marred by being set up wrong, thus destroying gameplay.

I'd play it again, with the right group, but it's on the trade list for now.

RATING: 10
One of my very best games growing up.  Some of the expansions got to be a little much.  (If you love Cosmic, you have to try playing with Moons, but if you love Cosmic you probably never or almost never played with Moons.)  When playing with Lucre, we always added 1/2 the Lucre to the combat total.  Our favorite was to play was deal out 3 or 4 powers per player, who then each select one open and one hidden power.  Playing 5 powers per player (one per system, kept only as long as you kept that system) was wild but also fun.

This one goes up to 11 (c.f. Spinal Tap...). Not for the faint-hearted, but by far the greatest example of chaos-gaming. It's still the game I would choose over any other with 5 or more players. I now have the Eon, Mayfair, and GW versions. All are good, but I do have fond memories of playing 6-player, 3-power Eon with all the expansions (except the moons) every weekend for 3 years. It also taught me everything you'd ever need to know about rules-lawyering.

RATING: 1
Less appealing than a sharp stick in the eye. It's been 20 years, and I'm still traumatized by my idiot friends' bizarre devotion to this monstrosity, and the handful of games I was lured into. Utterly boring and trivial, requiring virtually no skill. Fortunately, you can play while eating, drinking, talking and socializing, without paying any attention to the game itself. The most horrible game I have ever played, possibly the most horrible thing of any kind ever.

I was disappointed* recently to learn that for the "Hating the Top 100" GeekList, this 8-year-old comment was not the "most scathing" 1 rating for the game. The horror! So I am updating it as follows to make sure that, should another such list be attempted, there is no chance of being overlooked.

This game is so bad that puppies cry themselves to sleep when it is mentioned. This game is to Dutch parents what the boogeyman is to American parents, except that it will only kill the little Dutchlings if they are impolite or eat all the whale blubber. This game made babies with Satan, but they were too rowdy and ate the expensive furnishings, so they were sent to live with the Kardashians.

This game is so bad that someday, when time travel is invented, it will turn out that the reason it was invented was so that the first time traveler could go back and prevent the game from ever existing. Except of course that, when he returns from the past, his explanation makes no sense, because now no one has ever heard of the game. So he will have had to go back again and make it exist so that his motivation for extinguishing it will make sense, and then the whole Time Paradox Causality Matrix Effect drives him insane and he overloads the time machine, killing everyone in a 500-mile radius around Modesto, California, a place I have never been but which has an unpleasant sounding name and is, probably, the sort of place where the sort of person who invents time travel would live.

*And by disappointed I mean not affected in any way except to be mildly amused.

This isn't a gamer's game.  It's not for those high and mighty on strategy but it's an excellent game for those who enjoy playing mind games and meddling in someone else's plans.

I'd rate it higher but I believe the expansions are necessary for its full enjoyment.

Played new AH version (although host busted out his original Eon set and ALL the expansions to show us youngun's what-ho!).  Game in particular is much fun, with the core rules being simple enough for gamers and non-gamers alike.  The great part comes in with the different race powers -- these powers DRASTICALLY affected playing style in the first game, and it's easy to see that any subsequent games can be totally different.  Seemingly TONS of replayability.

I was given the original Eon edition of CE back when I was 11 years old or so - I loved it to death.  I bought the Mayfair edition along with More CE when that came out in 1992, and probably played that copy more than 200 times.  I bought the re-package that came out in 2004 or so (terrible, played it just once then packed it away) and have just played my first game of the 2008 edition - which I'm hopeful will become the definitive edition once they get an expansion under their belt!

One of my best geek claims to fame is that I was the winner of the "world CE championship" back in 1998 (or so...) at DexCon #6 in New Jersey.  I traveled a hundred miles and went without sleep for 3 days to play in that tournament.

Quite possibly my favorite game of all time. With all the crazy components thrown together (Mayfair version + More Cosmic + obscure Cosmic newsletter) it's more chaotic; more difficult to predict what your opponents are going to do. But that never stopped me from enjoying the hell out of this game. I might say the more stripped-down, online version is better (www.cosmicencounter.com) but I would prefer a much greater variety of aliens. I'm not really sure which I like better, and I don't know where I'm going with this so let's leave it at this: One of the best games ever! Oh, quibbles? Sometimes it's frustrating how the fates can screw you over, but if you want a luck-free game just go play chess. :)

RATING: 7
Quirky, fairly fast playing and bizarre, not so much a 'wargame' as an activity. Like being in a rolling wagon going down a hill, in theory you have some control and you don't know until the end of the ride whether it was fun or not.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I think I like this game, but I have a feeling that the Fantasy Flight version might be updated enough that it would make this a solid game for me. This is my kind of negotiation game though. The parameters for each action are laid-out and understood by all the players, so there's very little in the way of nebulous deal-making going on. I can't stand games that have you going back and forth with literally anything up for grabs. I do wish that there was a bit more going on with this system, but for a game that is 40 years old, it holds up remarkably well.

UPDATE: I ended up trading this away in favor of the Fantasy Flight version. The upgraded presentation and increased player count is worth it.

RATING: 7
Players take on the role of aliens with special powers and attempt to win by occupying 5 enemy bases. Combat is determined by "pointing the cone" at an enemy base, ask for allies, playing cards face down, reveal, then add the cards to your strength to see who wins. The special powers of aliens break many rules, which was quite innovative for 1977. 

I played this many times as a teenager in the early 80's. I thought it was a great game then, with multiple powers, and hidden powers, but now that I replay it, there is a certain unstableness to it, with a ton of luck. This is due to varying abilities of powers, the expansions, flares, kickers and so on. Still it is a relatively classic game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Never ever leaves the top few slots for me.  Infinitely replayable, modular and expandable.  Also, easy to teach with scalable complexity.

I've only played the Avalon Hill version with all the superfluous plastic, which by many accounts is inferior to the game's previous incarnations.  I find this rather easy to believe.  I really disliked the amount of randomness in the game, and was appalled to see encounter cards numbered 20 and 30 when I had a hand full of fours and sixes.  Race-specific powers are unbalanced, too.  At least it didn't take long.

RATING: 7
This was a staple for a long time - back in the 80's.
Short, very different games meant that you did not care too much about the fact a game was likely to be unbalanced.  Also the ability to call for "allies" was a great equalizer, meaning that even the super powerful races did not get it all their own way.
The first game in my experience to be based on "breaking the rules", had to be a big influence on Magic.

RATING: 2
The first game I played seemed a bit tedious. The player with the bacteria ability won, since all she had to do was get into a couple of systems and spread when they came up again. This seemed to be overly strong since she could easily get additional bases without having to be part of an actual attack. Seems to suffer from the same problem that magic has. If you don't get decent cards, you're likely to lose.

After my second play, I am convinced I never want to play this again. It's far too random to be enjoyable. There is no point in making any plans as the battle cards are so variable. Think your 15 is strong? Oops, I have the 40, looks like you lose. Oh, you think you won a battle? I have a special card that sends all attacking ships to the graveyard. And I get to put it back in my hand! I'm invincible! No thanks.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
First impression: I like how the core mechanics are quite simple but the game is far from trivial. Cosmic powers are unique and make every game interestingly different. There is a luck of draw with encounter/artifact cards you draw but I don't mind it and I think there should be some luck in this type of a game. Might not be as a good experience with non-gamers as everyone should carefully ask for alliances and be aware of situation all the time or game isn't as fun.

Crazy game where the whole point of the game is to exploit your special powers in order to win. Really unbalanced and unfair, good fun but not as much as I'd hoped it would be. I have only played this version with all the expansions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
One of my all-time favorites -- a mix of luck, strategy, negotiation, and role-playing (yes, role-playing!)  Each players represents an alien race, with a power that breaks or alters one of the game's rules.  With alien races such as Pavlov, Silencer, Reincarnator, Filth, and the ever-popular Sniveler, each player has specific advantages that they can exploit for fun and profit.  With different powers each time you play, the game is always a new experience... and if it starts to get old, you always have additions like two-power games, alternate home systems, and the lucre economy that you can tack on to the basic game.  A classic.

A few drawbacks keep this from a "10" or even "9" rating: certain powers seemed overly powerful or annoying and were removed from our home set (namely Diplomat, Witch, and Virus) and certain aspects of the game, such as the timing system, are not particularly intuitive.  Also, it is possible for multiple players to win at the same time, which sometimes lessens the thrill of a victory (but certainly makes the negotiation aspect more interesting...)

(Rating based on the Mayfair edition, including More Cosmic and the hexes from Simply Cosmic.)

RATING: 8
Proverbial example of how to make a game whose strength is normally seen as a flaw (unevenness). Throw in at least four players for avoiding a kingmaker, a rather big dose of luck (card draws, election of conflicts) and only a small amount of truly difficult choices... and you get a funny and incredibly interactive game which manages to be nasty without really annoying anyone. It's a mystery how it succeeds, but it does.

RATING: 7
Rating for the FF edition. A good game, but very fast and requires players understand the relative strength of the races and any special powers. There is a learning curve. Consequently it [i]can[/i] get very random; new players may not react well to constant screwage, or simply not understand everything that is going on.
This isn't the worst thing in the world, but should be understood from the outset. CE is light, relies on negotiation, foxing and luck, and plays fast. If you want something deep and strategic, look elsewhere.

RATING: 5.5
I first played Cosmic Encounter in 2006.  I have played both the Eon version and the latest Hasbro/Avalon Hill version.  As a game it was certainly ahead of its time.  Unlike a lot of other people who have rated this game I did not play Cosmic Encounter in my youth and have no sentimentality attached to the game as a result.  That said, I find it a bit lengthy and chaotic for my tastes.  While I wouldn't turn down a game, I certainly wouldn't be requesting it.

This is a good game with simple rules but then all manner of ways to bend and break the rules, mostly from character types.  The expansions just keep piling on the length of the game but add a bit of depth.

RATING: 5
I enjoy when playing with real fans, but it's a luck fest. The mechanisms are pretty simple - negotiate like crazy and then big card beats little card (with support modifiers from allies) if you weren't able make a deal. As such the mechanisms, and the board / components for that matter, don't lend themselves to being a great game in themselves. All the fun is in the special powers and being able to do the best with what you get. Having a sucky power is ok if you can use that perceived weakness as a strength in the negotiation aspect (a bit like Diplomacy really).

The fluidity of the negotiations keep any leaders in check, so I guess the strategy is to build yourself into a mid-game position from which to strike for the win. This is really an experience type game, trying to do the best with your powers and seeing what happens and telling the story afterwards. Which is of course quite a different gaming objective from most German / Euro games. If you love deal making, this is a game for you. If you don't, and you just play the cards as you get them, you're in for a luck-fest, one which I'm not a big fan of.

TRY Mar/05: Played the AH edition, and from what I've read, that'd be the one I'd want to own.  Good fun with my family, including an almost 6-year-old who's just learning to read.

Hmm.  First play went VERY fast (9 combined turns).  Subsequent plays have revealed a game that may go on and on...  and the 2-player variant seems positively broken, with some alien powers HUGELY unbalancing.

This game seemed revolutionary when it first came out: a game where the players each had a special power that subverted the rules. It was a game that was popular and fun to play. This is the original version. Since then, the game has been republished with numerous expansions. These have not all improved playability or the playing experience. In my view, this is one of those games that has suffered from expansionitis. I still like the original game tho.

I recall enjoying Cosmic Encounter in the 80s, and I still like games that give different sets of powers to different players.

  The game is excellent.  Always different, fast and fun. As a filler, the game can't be beat.  It is the grand daddy to a lot of games that exist today. (Citadels comes to mind).  Prefer Eon version to Mayfair.

While the AH version does not include flares, etc and only 20 aliens, it makes for a great introduction to Cosmic Encounter. It is fairly easy to pick up an AH version cheap on ebay. (I have.) The artwork is the best of all of the editions to date. I use the board and units from the AH version with all of the other stuff I have accumulated from other versions in the past....I have spent way too much on this game over the last 30 years.

Note: the FFG version is the best for game play.

I love and hate this game.

The races and combos are stellar and amazing and awesome.  Variety and number are amazing.  I like the random pulls for opponents, as it helps quell player-specific piling/vendettas.  Combat is nice, simple, and a good mix between strategic and random with the cards and commitment of resources.

That said, that's pretty much all the meaningful decision that I feel most of the time I play.  Which card do I want to play, maybe who am I willing to take help from for attacking.  I feel little to no incentive to help in defending other than to try to prevent game ending, and there's not a lot of control an individual player has over the game flow.  You can't do much to block a winning player who has a decent card or two, and you can't do much to improve your own fortunes if the cards aren't going your way.

[Rating for Avalon Hill version with the addition/adaptation of More Cosmic Encounter and 5 & 6 player boards created using a second copy of the game]

One of the best boardgame ever played for me. Simple, quite deep, with strong theme and exceptionally fun. I love the moltitude of gaming situations this game can create. Fantastic power interactions.
At best with five (or more) players in my opinion.

Avalon Hill version is a bit limited and supports only four players, a real pity because the components are awesome; so I expanded it by myself buying a second copy of the game and recreating some parts from the Mayfair's set.

This I compare to Dune - which looks like it it used many of the mechanics. I very much like Dune for the way it plays and the player interaction. CEs implementation is clunky by including the numerous special, challenge cards, alliance offers at every move each piece seems to detract from the game. There are so many "decision" points that making decisions are not worth while. Pity the game looked like it had potential. 
I did not play CE when it first came out - preferring other games such as Diplomacy, 1830... In retrospect I did not miss much.

If you want variable powers games - play Dune a much superior game.

The rules are abominable - how any one figures out the game from the rule set is beyond me.

It is indeed a candidate for the title of The One True Game.  Being able to cajole or wheedle others, manage your hand, and play to the strength of your Alien Power is what this game about -- and it's cool.  I've souped up my AH set by buying another to accomodate a 5th and 6th player, custom-made a full Eon deck, and added 80 powers with corresponding Flares (all the canon Eon powers [a few slightly tweaked], some of the Mayfair additions, and the best homebrews).  I also bought More Cosmic Encounter for the moons and used Axis & Allies chips for the Lucre.

RATING: 7.5
I enjoy playing this game.  It's easy to learn, and with each alien playing differently, there's allot of variety.  A gaming favorite while I was on deployment to Antarctica (Coast Guard), where we played a few times a week.

Like Kevin S. O'Brien, this is one of my all time favourite games (and I come from a period of playing board games before puters were around ...).  It isn't really a 2 player game, but with 4-6 peeps, inviting allies, hundreds of powers modified by moons and flares, the game has near infinite outcomes.

Good condition overall.  Some of the alien power cards are unpunched and unfolded.  The box has some wear, but nothing major.  Two of the hexagon pieces have a slight bend to them, and the rulebook has some yellowing.  A great classic version of this game.

What game is better than this?  It features conflict and partnership, bluffing and negotiation, resource management, trading, occasional zaniness, and has just the right balance of luck vs. skill (meaning it is unpredictable while still rewarding good play).  The powers and special cards give this game near infinite replay value.  The strategies, while not deeply analytical, require flexibility and adaptive thinking.  On top of all that, this game has a strangely compelling creativity.  I know of no other game that has the same quantity of player-made expansions.  You can't help but think about new powers and cards when you are finished playing this game.  Simply stated, Cosmic Encounter is the best game ever.  I have the Eon version, and will be getting the FFG version.

[color=#CC0000] 

    Some major disenfranchisement issues with what is by all appearances a thinking man's game.  The pieces simply do not always play nice together.  I found I had trouble remaining intellectually engaged in the play in spite of mechanics that keep you in the mix on other players' turns.

    An early rule-bender, the game was ground-breaking when it first appeared.  Credit where credit is due.  But I came to the table late on this one so that does not elicit an emotional response with me.  Though I'll certainly play when the opportunity presents itself, I'm not going to intellectually invest in the play, not out of stubbornness but instead because the game just hasn't coaxed me into it.  Too bad -- lots of people love this one.

Entertaining if simple.  Really a distribution game...the absence of dice is a nice touch.  Wanted more from the game though--some added depth.  We all enjoyed it nonetheless, and can see why it is a psuedo-classic:  it's easy, quick to pick up, and not difficult.  Also like the short play time.  The graphic design of the components is awesome--but we despised the "fiddly bits" aspects.  Or course--as many have already pointed out--this can be overcome by dispensing with the stacking and laying of ships in carriers and just using the ship markers in their "naked" state.  But still worth playing and graspable by the most newbie of gamers...

My rating is for the AH version. After hearing all the raves about this game, I bought the one that was easily obtainable, the AH version.

The original game that breaks its own rules. A weird and wonderful sci-fi game that I played a lot of in my past. First I played the Eon version, with its flares that you get to keep. Later I got my own copy, but it was the Mayfair version. I've got the components for that and the Mayfair expansion crammed into the original box. 

I've seen the new Fantasy Flight version and I think it's really nice.

Played an old Mayfair edition with fabulous retro sci-fi artwork. Fun, chaotic, thematic, but perhaps a little bit too long. I imagine the game length is dependent on the power interactions and player number -- maybe the AH version is stronger in this dept?

If you can dig up a copy of Dune, that does the same thing much better.

I remember struggling and failing to understand this when it (GW edition) came out, I guess when I was 13. But I was really drawn to it, and wanted to like it. 

Picked up a copy in trade a while back, finally got to play the FFG edition, on learning that far from being better with more, 3 is a perfectly acceptable number to play with.

The game has proven to be everything I wanted it to be; intensely enjoyable. The anticipation before a game, wondering what combo the powers will provide this time (and will they - can I force them to? - favour me?) is sublime.

Love both versions - altho Flares are neat, there's something just right in the GW ed balance.

The different starting abilities give this one legs. It's a good spaced themed beat up your opponent game, but it doesn't really do anything for me.

It's a little too chaotic for me and feels dated, but I don't mind a game every few years.

Before there was Magic:TG, there was Cosmic Encounter by Eon, and God saw that it was good. Then Mayfair got their hands on it and mucked around with it and mated it with a donkey. And God was right miffed, but he liked the components. Actually, I don't know what I'm talking about. But I did love to play this game. The whole concept of each player having special exceptions to the normal rules, and figuring out how those exceptions played out when used in combination, was so much fun. And Cosmic Encounter did it first. And God was confused, so He went home to play with his game collection and make box fart sounds. I haven't played this game in over a decade so my high rating might be glorifying the past...

[Eon]Man, I bet this game was brilliant back in the seventies, in fact I bet that even in the eighties this was revolutionary.  The sad truth is that there are just so many better games now.

It is a bit unfortunate that I came to this game so late in life.  I really wish I had this in high school.  Now, there is just too much down time and too little control.  It's all about if you have the right cards.  Dune and Acquire prove that old games can hold up, CE show how they can fall apart.

UPDATE [Mayfair]: After playing this again I really see how much this game just doesn't match up with my sensibilities.  Random draws off the deck to determine your "strategic attacks" random draws to determine the power of your hand and blind bidding to see if you win, awesome! In addition the chaotic results from special powers and crazy edicts make this an easy skip from now on.  There was no attempt at creating balance to this game, which is supposed to be good enough as players are forced to gang up on the leader, but that just isn't my kind of game anymore. Especially, how it just protracts the game even longer.  UGH!

Simple rules, tricky decisions, constant interaction, varied player powers, ease of teaching to new players, and customizability (especially if you add More Cosmic Encounter) make this one of the finest game designs ever.  An enormous amount of fun.  

One of those games that can turn a newbie into a geek before an hour is over. It has influenced designs from Magic:The Gathering to current Eurogames...I have the Mayfair version, which is attractive, especially the 6 player setup.                                                                 I Played the Eon set years ago, and prefer the Eon look, but the Mayfair rules -- it's easy to end up having the Galaxy overun by someone with an Alien power that aligns too well with a permanent, powerful flair.               
The Avalon Hill set is too fiddly and only has 4 players, when the game is at its best with 5 or 6.

RATING: 6
This is another sentimental classic for me, as it's one I've loved for decades.  The gameplay itself is basic, but everyone gets special powers that they can use to break the rules.  I've probably played this more than anything in my collection.  So many games have copied this, and because of this, there are better games to play; that said, I still pull it out.

RATING: 8
Have the original EON game with all nine expansions.  The further the expansions went, the less appealing the game became for me.  Rules/concepts I could do without:  Lucre, moons, and unique systems.  But otherwise a fantastic game.

Two hours of drudgery where I got roped into a game only to discover that my character gave me virtually no chance of winning.  It seemed like two of the characters were the most powerful and, lo and behold, they were vying for the win two long hours later.  One of those titles that probably benefits from nostalgia.

RATING: 7
This game is really fun, really easy, and really variating. Every player gets to pick a different alien race with different abilities. If this sounds interesting then you'll like it. If not avoid it. What this game basically comes down to is playing a card from your hand against your opponent and usually trying to figure out if he'll play a number card or an ability card. The major drawbacks of this game are largely unnecessary pieces, with a purely aesthetic value, that you'll often abandon and play without.

I have the AH version, and, while it is incredibly fun, a few of the powers are too strong, while others too weak.  I've yet to see a game in which the Healer did not crush everyone, regardless of the other powers involved.

RATING: 8
Home-made set I cobbled together during one of the many stretches that the game was OOP. I pieced together the rules I liked best from those I could find online, same with the powers. Then we made house rules on top of that. Staple for the entire family - love it!

First I bought the Eon version which fell apart, then the Games Workshop version with the horrible little cones that slip out of player's hands, and then the Mayfair version which is the one I recommend. Avoid the newest version with all the little pieces if possible because bizarrely this is only a four player game, and this plays much better with five or six. This game was one of the inspirations behind Magic: The Gathering.

I didn't discover this one until the Hasbro era, and have only been able to get enough people to try it 4-player twice.

This game was one of the biggest hits in the 80s. It actually sold for very high prices on auctions until it was reprinted by Mayfair.
Sadly (or gladly) the hobby has moved forward a lot since those days and Cosmic Encounter got overtaken by today's games.

Previously owned a copy of ASS "König der Sterne".

One of my most-played games of all time.  It's great fun for 3-6, though you kind of have to calibrate how much craziness you want--Does it stop with flares?  Moons?  Lucre?  Eventually the system starts to get more complicated than it's worth, but it's a very clever design and great fun.  And has been for 25 years.

RATING: 6
Great components. Clever Alien actions but there seems to be little you can do if people gang up on you.

Good points: different Alien rules in combination make for a unique gaming experience.

Bad points: Really just a game about diplomacy. More strategy (eg some of the the EON expansions)was needed in the AH version, to make this game stand out in today's market.

A friend of mine had this and we use to play it loads and I absoloutely loved it. A great game of negotiation and the variable powers meant each game could play very differently. I long for a copy of my own...

RATING: 4
The ships are annoying - the mothership totally useless and the carriers not far behind.

Some powers seem overpowered and allow people to succeed when they barely know what they are doing.  I suppose that would be ok, if this were more fun.  I'll play again in hopes that I'm just missing something/playing with the wrong group.  But I doubt it.

Really enjoyed this in the 1970s but everybody had more time to spend on stuff back then. In retrospect it has a sort of balance of power mechanism that prevents a runaway leader but also prevents the game from ending at a decent hour. I am not sure how much fun it will be if I ever play it again.

I picked up Cosmic Encounter years before I actually played it - but in college, I brought it out, and it immediately infected the entire residence hall.  I'd come home from classes day after day and see a message on my white board "Cosmic tonight?"  No other game I own has managed to grab people in such a way.  I have both the Mayfair and Avalon Hill versions of the game, although all my gaming has used the Mayfair edition.  It's been quite a while since I've played CE, in fact, probably since before I finished my undergraduate education, and I do miss it.

Mayfair edition: more rule vaguenes and inconsistency than I usually like in a game.  Mixed with a lack of balance (even though I understand the game adjusts for powerful powers by having people work together against them), it just doesn't stand as a classic for me.

(Avalon Hill Edition) Simple and fun. It is just missing that extra level of strategizing that would make it more engrossing. I have only played it with four. I hear it is much better with five or six, but the new set hasn't yet produced an expansion yet.

I own the Avalon Hill version, which while fun, suffers from the lack of a 6 player expansion and does not have rules for flares or moons.

Random, with a dash of randomness for spice.  The only way to alleviate the randomness is to negotiate - and that's only a partial solution.

RATING: 7
One of my first 'classic' board game experiences. Any game where all but one player can win at one time is a hoot. Playing with the early edition and the expansions with the funky alien powers is a must. The recent "AH" reissue was disapointing, the molded plastic space ships that look like actual spaceships are frustrating, clumsy and overdone. Not to mention that horible 'mothership' you have to balance attacking and allied ships in. Completly inferior to the original battle cone.

FINALLY got to play the full tilt version of this game.  I now know someone who owns literally every expansion for Eon and Mayfair editions of the game along with some of the web published stuff as well.  With a lot of crazy dynamics going on this is quite a fun game I see what the big deal is now...however I still cringe thinking about the AH version.  UGH!

Played the Mayfair version (Kev's) with lots of expansions and flares.  My first game ever, and so many events going on that I think some basic element of the game got a bit overshadowed.  A shame, cause I can see it's a good game in principle.  Looking forward to the next game..    ...    And played a second one now, with the Eon version (Chris'), with even more expansions and flares, and two powers each.  Still a bit overwhelming getting used to everyone going on, but liking the game, and have uprated it as a result!   ...   And now have played with the Avalon Hill version.  Seemed almost too basic after all the complicated games.  Want to try with two powers each instead of one; that might spice it up.

I know the Avalon Hill version is regarded as a lousy incarnation by most Cosmic Encounter fans (and that is, of course, the one I own) but I was hoping for so much more from this game. It was alright, my son loved it, but I don't have an urge to suggest it ever again. I will usually play if there's a game going, so it gets a 7, but then I'm so starved for games that I'd play a lot worse just to get in some game time.

I finally got a chance to play this classic game at Origins `06.

I have some questions.  I wonder how often it is possible to have a singular victory.  I pretty much remained unnoticed until I got my fourth planet, then, of course, no-one wanted to ally with me.  When another player got his forth base, he was lucky enough to draw me and I was happy to compromise for a shared win.  Apparently, it worked for him, too, since he didn't betray me.  How many different ways could this have played out?  I don't know the game all that well, but I can bet that there were edicts or flare cards that could have encouraged either one of us to feign cooperation.

That leads to the other question.  How vital are the extensions to the game?  I have the A.H. version, so I only have the basic set.  The heart of the game does seem to be in the negotiation and in correctly picking your allies.  Will the game be as much fun without the flares and additional edicts?  Now that I have played the game, I have more incentive to find out.

I recently discovered that I and my whole game group had been playing it wrong in one large, crucial way: you can only attack units belonging to the player whose system you're attacking in. Huh. Makes for a much shorter game that way. Still a very cool game for five or six players (theoretically two or more). Elegantly simple rules except for all the clearly defined exceptions....

A great and truly innovative design, which seems to have not fared well over the years. While I can totally see how so many people can love and play this game over and over gain, for the long hours that it takes, I can't ignore my knowledge of better or quicker games that do similar things. I just don't enjoy the whole experience, though I appreciate many of the individual parts.

My ratings for the expansions are based on my playing them integrated into the regular game, so I don't know which expansions are what, and frankly don't care; the game was one of the most fun I ever played when I was young, and IMHO, fie on the remakes that do Eon's version no justice. FIE on them!

Yuch.  I HATE this game, and I've never understood why it has such a following.

Annoyingly abstract, with long, boring gameplay with little strategic choice since you can't even attack who you want, and nearly every game of this I've ever had to suffer through was won by kingmaking.  Yippee...

*After one 4P game* A lot of chaos with very little player control.  It was fun for a while, but seemed to drag on a bit.  I can appreicate the variety of special powers, few rules, infinite replay value, etc - BUT I lean more toward the analytical game.  I would have enjoyed this much more as a teen or in college when sillyness was more appreciated.  Glad that I got a chance to play it.

The best most imagunative game in the cosmos. There are an infinite number of ways to win, and no two games are the same. If you aren't winning then you never feel like there is  not a chance for you to come back. Quick wit imagination and planning is what you need to make this game realy work.

RATING: 6
People talked so much about this game and made such good comments about it that I went out and bought the Avalon Hill version that is now available in stores. I can't say I'm impressed. The game is so unbalanced that we created a house rule: every other round we throw away the races that we have and randomly select new ones. This way if you are handled a stinker or if your opponent has a killer, at least you know it won't be for long.

Traded away on 2012/03/03.

Eon version. First Play - 4 players - 3 of us were new players so the player that knew the game (albeit from years ago) kicked us around a bit. There were some timing issues that came up that were resolved after some discussion. I'm not sure we were 100% accurate with the rules but I was happy with how it played. I'm looking forward to the next one and I'd like to get the next two expansions to bring this up to 6 players. *update* I've been playing my group's FFG version lately. Great components and the additional cards add quite a bit to the game.

I'm greatly disappointed in the AH set, but FFG is the perfect company to pick this great game up and dust it off.

I like it enough to've built a frankenstein Mayfair set. The Eon flares are just plain better, but that's typical Mayfair, interfering (usually with bad art) just to interfere.  Zany, chaotic fun.

The best dice-and-wine experience I've ever had and a reasonable candidate for 'greatest tabletop game ever.' Its 'exception-based' design is the chief inspiration for Richard Garfield's little card game -- and so half of the modern tabletop industry. Fast, funny, social, and not even a little bit balanced (that's up to you).

I've never even laid eyes on the new edition. I've heard it's nice, but in our crew we value the finer things, so I've only played an ancient copy.

An essential gaming experience.

Original Comment and Rating: "I have the EON version.  Best game ever!" 10

What I lacked in content, I made up for with enthusiasm.  Why the downgrade?  First, the powers can be wildly out of balance.  And second, with as many ways to "bend the rules" as this game has (especially when the expansions are included,) there inevitably arises a situation where a referee is needed to settle a dispute - and there usually isn't an impartial one on hand.

BUT - this game is my one "burning house" item, the thing I'd consider going back into a burning building to retrieve providing my family was out and safe.  (Disclaimer: The baby scrapbook is within an arm's reach of the game shelf, I'd pull a two-fer.)

As a two player game this gets a 5.75.  (Essentially luck of the card draw, provided the alien powers are evenly matched.)

I love the chaos of this game. I have a lot of great memories of playing this with 2 or 3 friends back in the late 1980s. My favorite alien was the "Plant". The new FFG version looks really cool but I just can't part with my old Eon version and I just can't justify owning both.

Played a few times. In my experience, the most interesting part of the game is determining which powers have been given to the players at the beginning. The actual gameplay is boring at best, with king-making and frustration possibilities to spice up the randomness and the unbalance. Maybe the expansions add some control? Some interest? But I guess I will never know.

Be warned that there is plenty of diplomacy and fans of optimal decision making based on "return on investments" may find it overly chaotic or lacking. Still its a great game because it plays so differently every time you play it and is full of surprises and the most unexpected deal making. 

1st (Eon) edition is still my favorite.  The trick when teaching this game is to play basic set only, then every so many games add the next expansion (once the game becomes routine).  Throwing all of them in at once is IMO less fun.  If you take a break from the game go back to the basic when you decide to rediscover it again.

Cosmic Encounter, without the $#%@ lucre expansion rules, remains my Favorite Game of All Time... depth, options, variety, replay... it's all in there. And lots of backstabbing, to boot! The Hasbro/AH version is an inferior, lackluster offering, and rates a lowly 4/10 -- nice production quality, but limited 4 player games, 1/2 the alien powers, no flares and lack of other options detracts from the game. Kevin Wilson did a fabulous job with the FFG to streamline the gameflow and create a more consistent game language to reduce timing conflicts and increase overall clarity.

I give this game a 10 value even though I don't play anymore. When I first got a hold of this I played it so obsessively that I got burned out. Interestingly, back then everybody I introduced the game to loved it. Now I game with a different crowd and very few of them like it at all.

I own the AH version. This game is best with people who know how the game works, since trying to outgues your opponent is half the fun. Backstabbing your allies is the other half. Can bog down at the end when everybody is trying to prevent eachother from winning.

RATING: 6.5
Finally got to play this classic with Kevin Wilson of FFG.  Big plus for the variety of aliens with their respective power and flare card, which result in some very interesting effects as to how the game was played.  I like the fact one can invite allies to attack or defend a base, however, the scarcity of reinforcement cards often meant the supporting players can only watch but not affect the outcome after the attack cards are revealed.  Compromise is maddening, and backstabbing happened with frequencey.  Definitely not a game for those that don't like confrontation and/or are easily offended.  My other concern is that it seem to have the tendency to run long as people start to gang up on the leader.

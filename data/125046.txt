*Rating based on one play.

A unique take on deckbuilding with a very unique theme.  However, I'm not convinced the game works.  It doesn't feel like you have much control over the composition of your deck, and it feels like it might be more random than other deckbuilders out there.  I think I need another play to really decide how much I like it.

Fantastiqa is one of the games that showed me how much a compelling aesthetic is important to me when board gaming. Although I only own the Rucksack Edition (I would gladly own the Enchanted Edition if it was available in Australia), the game clearly represents a genre style in a consistent and unique manner. The real-life art and specific literary references evoke wonder and respect for the versatile power of imagination.

Mechanically, this is augmented deckbuilding. It is my favourite deckbuilding game for a number of reasons. Firstly, it gives the deck purpose - in games like Dominion, where the deck IS the game, the luck of the draw kills it. Secondly, it incorporates the basic strategies of deckbuilding - streamlining, reshuffling, hand management - with balance. Some of the speedier deckbuilders like Thunderstone and Star Realms are too quick to allow players to thin decks. Finally, it manages a few currencies, like Mage Knight, but does them so you have to commit to a path and then race your opponent to the end.

RATING: 10
The best card game and best deck-building game I have ever played! It sinks Dominion without a trace, and the iconography is a lot clearer than Race for the Galaxy. It is extremely well-themed, and uniquely themed: it feels like you're a character in a nineteenth-century fantasy-novel by George MacDonald. Mind you, given the desire among older kids (that is, ages 13-25) to look "mature", the theme might be a turn-off for some in that age group. 
Very dream-like, and not like any other "fantasy" game out there, at present. The art is a beautiful (all derived from fine-art sources) and refreshing breath of sweet, clear, fantastical air. The alliterative flavour text is hilarious! 
Professor Seegert has designed a wonderful system that is scalable in terms of difficulty levels, time commitment, and number of players. Nevertheless, I would not call it a gateway game: there's just far too many options to consider each turn, except in the early game...and even then, with more frequent play, the options won't appear as obvious as they did during your first games. And getting just about anything done is quite a challenge. Tension is relatively low, initially, but rises considerably as the game progresses, when lucrative Open Quests are available.
Negatives? While the rules are well-written and generally clear, there are a number of potential circumstances that just aren't addressed, and require players to make an educated guess. There is also a fair bit of housekeeping that needs to be done when setting up and cleaning up Fantastiqa....but it's worth it!
This is the best new game I have been introduced to in about a year and a half!

The theme and art all jump out at me. Love the quirky fantasy vibe. Rules made it sound potentially decent, but the gameflow is meh. Feels like you're putzing around doing nothing and suddenly everybody starts scoring all the points at once and it's over. The drama and decisions are pretty bland.

RATING: 6
Thematically Fantastiqa is like an old fashioned fantasy tale for children.  Friendly dragons offer cups of tea, while the very baddest monsters are merely grumpy and have poor personal hygiene. None are slain by the player characters; instead the "subdued" monster joins the character's team. In the same spirit, the game's quests offer tasks such as "Swing from the Marsh Mangroves of Myria and win back the gem of Joopolo". I found all of this unusual and charming.

Mechanically Fantastiqa marries deck-building to a spatial element, with characters moving between locations in order to subdue monsters, gain benefits from visiting a statue, or complete a quest.  A problem that I have with pure deck-builders is that, regardless of theme, they feel pretty abstract affairs of currencies, special abilities and victory points.  I found Fantastiqa's spacial element didn't reduce that feeling of abstraction very much as it is itself fairly abstract.  There is no sense of journeying through a land as there is in, say, Runebound.  

The deck-building element doesn't work as we're all used to.  Conventional deck thinning is expensive both in time and gems, the game's currency.  However, as a free action you can add cards to a quest, getting them out of your hand until the quest is completed. The cards themselves mostly have just one or two icons.  Only artefacts bring possibilities for manipulating your deck.   As deck-builders go, Fantastiqa feels rather pedestrian.

I mostly like Fantastiqa's use of fine art, although the two female characters look anything but adventurers.  Component quality is excellent.

RATING: 4.5
Rating based on a single play where I got trounced. The game's not incredibly complex but I for some reason felt completely directionless throughout most of this game. I don't know if I like moving to acquire cards, because often cards I wanted pulled me into useless corners, and moving to places I needed to be clogged up my deck with garbage cards.

It's been a while since a game this mechanically simple made me feel lost as to what I should be doing. Sometimes that's good, though. I'd be willing to play this more times and see if it opens up.

RATING: 9
A wonderful game. The game is deeper than it seems. In many ways the picture of the wanderer above the sea of fog truly depicts the game. To the untrained eye only the superficial level of the game (the fog) is visible. The true game lies beneath the fog and only the one patient enough to wait (play it a lot) will see it for what it is.

The repercussions of your choices reverberate throughout the entire game. Even simple choices like whether to subdue an extra creature or not are very important in the long term or the timing of the use of tents and magic carpets. 

Third and most important to me: this game is based on simple concepts and rules that eventually become an extremely complex game. This quality alone raises it above the rest!
I wholeheartedly believe the Da Vinci quote that "simplicity is the ultimate sophistication". Furthermore I can name very few games even in the top 100 that share this quality. I am not saying that the game is perfect but it is aesthetically pleasing as a pure boardgame design.

RATING: 7
Fantastiqa is a visually beautiful game with nice components and beautiful art.  The cards have an interesting antique texture, and the "statues" are so attractive that I wanted to grab them, move them, and play with them.  Interestingly, the actual player pieces are nice, but I still wanted to move those statues every turn!  Can't I be one of those cool statues?

This is a deck building game with some interesting twists, particularly the team play when playing with 4 players.  Exchanging cards with a team member when you are in the same location on the board is an interesting mechanic.  It took us awhile to figure out how much better we could do in the game by exchanging cards. Duh!  Why didn't we do that earlier?  The iconography in the game is "interesting," perhaps a bit young, but nevertheless, charming.

Bottom line:  if you are a fan of Dominion, or deck building games in general, you should definitely try Fantastiqa.  It is the next cool thing in deck building.

A deck building game with some classical artwork on many of the cards and components. It gives the whole game a style that lets you feel like you're playing inside some childishly strange fantasy world. Which is the point after all. Using the cards you have you move through this world gathering more resources in order to score points to win the game. This game reminds us in some ways of a much much MUCH lighter version of Mage Knight. In fact after playing this game we traded Mage Knight for that reason. Fantasiqa gives you the feel of exploring a fantasy realm but without the novella of rules you need to understand in order to play Mage Knight.

This game surprised me.  I was expecting it to be a simplistic deck builder aimed at children.  While not complicated in terms of rules, the game has a lot of think to it.  It is much deeper than it first appears.  It has elements of A Few Acres of Snow and Mage Knight to it, but it is by no means a rip off of those.  I liked this better than Mage Knight (a bit more streamlined).  For me it is a satisfying deckbuilder because you are doing something on the board with the deckbuilding.  It is not merely a deckbuilder.  Very surprised and very pleased with game.  Refreshing in many ways.  Including the art and theme.  Superb design and gameplay.

I am fond of mr. Seegert's designs: the ones I tried always felt original and characterful. So when the cheaper reprint of Fantastiqa came out, I jumped at the occasion and bought it.

The game is a quite unusual deckbuilder. There is a "map" on which players move their pieces, and by moving the decks take shape: each move a monster will be subdued and added to the deck. But there are other cards to be obtained while remaining still at a location (through Statue actions, paying diamonds): artifacts add peculiar free actions, and beasts are the strongest monsters.

The goal of the game is complete quests, and reach a certain number of quest points. There's a couple of open common quest, but players can acquire personal quests (again through Statue actions) that opponents can't steal.

The theme is unusual, and the dreaming, literary atmosphere permeates the game. The paintings used as artwork help a lot in that way.

The only two things I really don't like in the game, and both feel like Eagles' fault:
1) the rulebook is well written, but horribly laid out and learning the game is harder because of that
2) the graphic design is really poor, both artistically speaking (how can you mix paintings with clip-art like images?!?) and functionality-wise (when you look at the table, you just see a "cacophony" of colors).

Anyway, I quite like the game, and I would like to play it again. Particularly I'd like to try the 4p partnership.

It's an okay deck-building game with an unusual theme.  A friend says it feels repetitive but I think we played inefficiently.  The primary downsides are bloating of player decks with weak cards from movement (adventuring) and that you must keep 1 of 3 quest cards (goals) when you draw cards at the quest statue so you could end up with a real stinker, and incomplete quests count against you.

If I were to be asked what game has my favorite theme, I would say this one. The game might not be very good, but I can't tell at all. The whole circle of subduing is a neat trick and trying to pare your deck down to the essentials is a bit of a challenge too. So, yes, I do think it's one of the most interesting deck builders I have come across. But man, this theme. I love it so much.

RATING: N/A
Some nice ideas, simple yet effective deckbuilding mechanics, and horribly designed cards. I do wish more had been done with the gems - have different colours serve different uses, rather than as generic pieces - and perhaps have each character's standard set of cards feature differently named items (and slightly different setups). But for what it is, the game is extremely... functional. The card titles are a little on-the-nose, and the ability to use two matching symbols as a wildcard is a little generous (I would use three of a kind - make such decisions trickier). So much to like, but also so much design mediocrity!! Worth trying, if nothing more.

I like the production of the game.  The mechanics are somewhat unique for a deck builder.  As a deck builder I had a hard time knowing what my deck was about.  Mostly I would just use tactics to pick the best move and end up with some cards.  Only played once.

Lovely art and lovely game concepts in a game that's lighter than I tend to prefer. I especially like the entwining of traveling and acquiring cards; sometimes you want to do both, but sometimes half of the equation becomes a cost rather than a benefit.

RATING: 6
Components: Nice artwork, cribbed from various sources. Good iconography. Chunky statue tokens. I'm not a fan of the graphic design (i.e. the cards look a bit blah). It's a cool dynamic touch that the statues are randomly placed, but I think it's unnecessary that the locations are also randomly placed. I didn't see any card that referenced two locations, so they are, in effect, already randomized by the fact that I only care about their relation to each other with respect to the statues and quests. Would have made for a much nicer game board to have actual location art painted on the board, with paths between locations.

Experience: One of the core tenets of the deck-builders I've played is that it's good to quickly get rid of my starting deck, replacing it with better versions of the same cards. Somehow I found that particularly difficult to do here. It's costly to release a card; difficult to dismiss a friendly dragon, and I'm clogging my deck with low-level creatures just by adventuring. The mistake I made was thinking it was all about acquiring a variety of subduing icons. Rather, I should have specialized, and selected quests that matched my specialty. I used many gems to buy artifacts and bazar creatures, but these gems would have been better used releasing cards.

I like that the low-level monsters grant additional powers.

It's fun to look over the board, identify the creatures I need to subdue to complete my quests, and think about how I'm going to adventure around efficiently.

The quests make for very interesting card welling that I underutilized. I can temporarily get cards out of my deck very efficiently via quests, even if I never plan to complete the quests, and even if the cards have nothing to do with the quest. The starting deck contains 12 cards; I can immediately dump up to 10 of these on the two quests in the middle of the board, which I may then withdraw from at any time. This means that right out of the gate I should be able to convert my deck to a well-tuned subduing machine.

Players are adventurers, teleported to a mysterious land, where they must recruit allies and complete quests.  Players on their turn choose to do one of three things - Adventure (travel the board, subduing creatures and acquiring them to their deck); visit a Tower (purchase Quest, Beast or Artifact cards for their deck, or thin their deck by paying gems); or complete a Quest (pay the correct number of cards to complete an open or private quest, for victory points).  On top of this, players may take free actions such as use a magic carpet chip to travel, stash cards from their hand in a separate "Questing" deck, and so on.  Nice, simple deck building game, with a charming theme, terrific production values, and importantly, feels a little bit different from this rapidly increasing genre of boardgames.  The rules are easily taught, and the game play offers up some nice deck management decisions.  I liked it.

Do you think the "Q" hurts sales because people can't find it? 

But I digress. The game has a beautiful storybook style and should appeal widely. The mechanics and bits are fun, but I wouldn't estimate that players who are In It To Win It would really like this one. It's a bit tough to build a strategy. 

My only complaint is the set-up is laborious. Fortunately they give you baggies for all the starting equipment which helps out a lot.

DEC. 2014 UPDATE - Bumped to a solid "8" after multiple plays and purchasing a couple expansions. Choosing what actions to take on your turn is always fun and it's easier to build a strategy than I initially thought. 

The team dynamic introduced in a 4-player game is also surprisingly fun.

General comments: This game is often misunderstood - it's about adventuring first, deck-building second, and shouldn't be evaluated as a deck-builder because this mechanic plays a backseat role in this game.  The rules can feel a bit more complex than they should be in your first game.  Are you playing the game or is it playing you?  - can be hard to develop a strategy and wonder about how meaningful your decisions are and how much control you have, but focus on the narrative and fun.  It's a very thematic, whimsical and charming adventure that grows on you.  Best with 2 or in partnerships I think.

played a prototype. Based solely on that play it is not a children's games nor a game for adults I would enjoy, it seems unlikely that I'll ever get a chance to play the finished version.

RATING: 6
Charming at first glance. There is a spatial element in this deckbuilder, but in my opinion it neither feels like an adventure nor is its gameplay as original as some reviews led me to believe; it boils down to set collection and tuning your deck. It can be a fun race though, especially in the 4-player (teams) game.

I am rather shocked at how much fun I have playing this game despite its being rather simple (game is for 8 and above). It really is just a deck-building game, but somehow it is more than that. Well-designed, and absolutely beautifully made. One of the nicest looking games I have ever seen. If you have friends, I cannot recommend a game higher than this one. If you don't, I still recommend it.

Played my first game of Fantastiqa today. There were three of us and we all loved it. Plus everyone watching kept commenting on how beautiful everything was. The game has a lot of depth that I think some people miss. The theme is very fun and whimsical. I can't wait to play again. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Fantastiqa is an okay, but not great deckbuilder. I found the feeling of the game quite repetitive. The majority of it is collecting symbols in order to beat cards with those symbols to gain their symbols and beat even "tougher" monsters with more symbols. Artifact cards help with bending the rules in your favour.  Even though I really like the use of public domain classical art (fantasy games should take a note that some of us are sick of the flashy, steroidal art that is so generic in fantasy games today) I found the symbol graphics and general graphic layout quite off-putting and kept me from getting into the theme (which is pretty whimsical). There is a game here, but considering the large handful of deck builders that I truly admire, I just don't see any room for Fantastiqa in my list of special DBs. Perhaps it is because it doesn't have what I like quite a bit with deckbuilders: cool combo moves. There's really no combo system here. It's simple symbol matching with some other cards to bend the rules here and there. Can't imagine wanting to play this again. Just felt clunky. Oh well! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Well, it's not as good as it could be, but it's OK. The Peaceful Dragon mechanism for slowing the game down is almost unnecessary as the game goes quite slow enough. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Fantastiqa is utterly fantastic and I can't get enough of it. The more I play it the more the deck building stands out as one of the best deck building systems in any game. The amount of subtle emphasis the game puts on knowing every single card in your deck and having a really solid mechanic for weeding out cards you don't need, really makes it one of those games that you appreciate more and more as you play it.

Every card you add to your deck makes it harder to complete your specific goals, but you NEED to add more cards to your deck to reliably move around the board. You can remove cards from your deck, but doing so is costly both in using an action that could further your progress in the game as well as in gems that could be otherwise spent on "better" cards. It really feels like every action in the game has a wonderfully balanced benefit and drawback that needs to be considered, while being really light on analysis paralysis.

The game itself is so easy to play and so simple in core mechanics, but it's incredibly well balanced, hides a TON of depth and strategy, has a really fascinating theme, and is just outright fun to play.

RATING: 5.5
Uniquely styled deck builder with a fantastical theme that feels out of the 1920's or 1930's. Unique in the sense that the fantastical theme is strangely twisted into a blending old Victorian, Alice in Wonderland, and almost a Monty Pythonesque- Terry Gilliam quality- sort of. The game play is smooth, quick, & easy to follow, and there is purpose here- for a deck builder, unlike others of it's kin. If you allow yourself to get drawn in, you're doing more than just hopping around & collecting items & defeating monsters (and adding them to your forces). But I suppose that is the difference and game-breaker of many a game, whether or not one buys into the theme. I'd return to it here and there, but not often enough to rate it an 8. Still enjoyable, though.

RATING: 5
A deck builder combined with a board but the deck building side is very weak - cards come out randomly at all times with actually very little variation in effect so not much to think about - the main objective is to complet quests (collect card sets of symbols) but this is simplified (in terms of game play) way to much by being able to store cards against the various quests out of your hand (effectively removing them from your deck - so free deck thinning). "Better" cards are available to buy using the games second currency (gems) but it seldom pays to waste the turns getting these as just collecting base cards at random and storing them up against the quests will win the game anyway.  

Components are very pastel as is the art - may appeal to children. All the bits are very good quality.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Deckbuilder meets Elfenland, which is a positive. It takes more than one play to get a feel for this game, since you need to plan out a little more how to get places and optimize yourself to accomplish quests. Efficiency meets route-planning. I quite like this inventive mix of mechanics.

I am one of those smitten with the theme and idea behind this game. Really impressed with the components. I know people are complaining about the graphic design, but really it is perfectly functional. I am an art/design person and I am fine with this. If I had one request it would be to feature the classic art even more and give more information about the pieces and artists.

Very similar to Mage Knight except with a human level of complexity.  A little oblique to start out but it ends up developing through quite an arc.  The public goals seem to be the key, maybe too much so.  Overall very satisfying experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fantastiqa is a light-hearted deck-builder using (mostly) classic romantic artwork, set in a fantasy world with a feeling something like Carroll's Wonderland.

Alf Seegert has gone the classic art route before (Road to Canterbury) and again it seems to work well with the mood he sets.

The players defeat creatures to add them and any rewards to their deck. Subdued creatures bring standard abilities (Dragons - Fire, Trolls - Club, Fairies - Magic...) and may also offer other abilities or gems.

The combat and monetary systems have been streamlined to the simplest level: match abilities from cards in hand to defeat creatures or fulfill quests, play two to four gems to buy things.

All of this makes it a family friendly game, but one with some meat for older players.  Player interaction is mostly denying cards to others by claiming them first, or by putting useless Peaceful Dragon cards in others' decks.

That said, I don't expect this will hold up to repeated plays as well as Agricola, or even Core Worlds- it is a family deck-building game, and it hits that niche fairly well.

Starting this at a 7 after two plays (one 3-player live, one 2-player solo).

Took me a few plays to get into this game. I spent my first few games trying to wrap my head around the "silly" theme and play style of the game.

RATING: 7.5
I really enjoy this game, though the game is really best with 2 - adding a third or fourth player does not really add much to the game.  For the length and light-ish feel of the game there are a lot of interesting strategic choices.  To me it seems the most important aspect of the game is deciding how you want to build your deck.  There is a great interplay between the various statues, open and personal quests, and all the creatures on the board such that the best strategy to build a good deck is not always clear (what constitutes a "good deck" is not always clear either, and can change over the course of the game).  The game can be a little slow to start (understandable since it can take awhile to get a good deck going), but by the end the gameplay is fast, furious, and tense.  Another great sleeper title from Alf Seegert.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Cannot recommend this game enough. It's one of our games that hits the table often. It's whimsical, thematic, and strategic. It's also great since you can vary the length of the game by choosing how many quests you'd like to complete.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I generally don't like deckbuilders, but this one is so light that it doesn't really feel like one -- plus it's got board play. Pretty much you go around the board, defeating monsters or completing quests if you have the right cards, or buying new cards if you have the gems. You can almost always do something good on your turn, and some game elements (e.g., the magic carpet tokens, two of the same symbols make a wild) seem designed to ensure this. I find the theme and art utterly charming, and for me that is the game's main strength. 

Fantastiqa is a family-style game, and probably too light for many gamers. Yet it's short of being a very good gateway game because it's a bit fiddly rules-wise, and setup is a chore (the expansions, while interesting, exacerbate this). Still, such charm.

new deck building games seem to continue to be the rage.  this one actually has a game board with some interesting new ways to build your deck.

in the end however it seems overly complex and takes longer than the advertised 60 minutes play time (especially if you need to explain the rules which seem overly complex, if you can get past this one and haven't played Dominion yet it makes Dominion look like a breeze).

one good thing for those that like it (I don't)... this one has lots of theme

This is an interesting take on deck building, with a great Victorian adventurer theme. The goal of the game is to complete missions for victory points. In the course of doing that, you travel the board and encounter monsters. When you defeat them (combat is vert simple and straightforward) you add them to your deck and can use the to either defeat other monsters, or complete the previously mentioned missions. There's not a ton of strategy, but the game is still quite fun, and the theme and design are really beautiful.

Unlike Thunderstone, Fantastiqa does not trip over itself trying to replicate Dominion closely AND being a totally different game at the same time. (I thought Thunderstone was a mess (but Thunderstone Advance is better...).) This is a different game in the whole way it is conceived and executed. It is basically an abstracted adventure game, so if the words "abstract" and "adventure" don't work together for you, don't get it. However, I have to say that the board play, while simple, is well-designed, and the special artifact cards are a great help while not being over-powered. It is basically a set-building/deck-building game. And it works. And it's fun.

Update: I didn't find a lot of replayability in this. Not enough variety, so I've docked it a point.

Fantastiqa has the highest production quality of any game I’ve ever seen.  What really makes this game stand out though is the unique and fun gameplay. Compared to other deck-builders I’ve played the ramp-up time (the time it takes to build a deck that allows you to actually do something cool) is lower – it’s very satisfying to jump right in and begin subduing creatures. On the other hand, I never feel like I get to the point where my deck is too powerful, as sometimes happens in Thunderstone. Different strategies are possible and you can get awesome combos by using card effects, treasure tokens and artifacts. The gameplay and mechanics are every bit as solid as the components.

Fantastiqa is a deck-building board game set in a fantastical landscape of dark forests, mist-shrouded highlands, and frozen wastes. As you and your foes journey around the board, you will subdue strange creatures and fulfill fabulous quests.

Each creature you encounter has both an ability and a vulnerability. By playing card symbols to which a creature is vulnerable, you can subdue it and recruit it as an ally. Each creature you defeat is added to your expanding deck of cards, making its special ability into an ability of your own! A defeated Enchantress will wield her beguiling charms to help you overcome wandering Knights. Knights in turn subdue Dragons, adding their fiery breath to your cause. By combining the powers of different creatures you can fulfill curious quests.

One of those games I am glad a friend owns and am willing to play from time to time.  This is an interesting take on deckbuilding mixed with a bit of an adventure theme as you acquire cards by taking out the creatures which then become your cards.  Cards can have different special abilities, provide a gem, and provide an additional icon or two to help defeat future creatures/quests.  This is a race game to a certain number of points.  I found the game enjoyable, but also at times a bit tedious.

A great deck-building questing game by the designer of Road to Canterbury.  In this game, you are adventurers who have been given a rucksack of common household items such as spatulas, toothbrushes, washcloths, etc.  You are magically transported to Fantastiqa where your items have suddenly become swords, magic wands, magic carpets, etc.  A very thematic game where you can actually believe you are questing in the game...a rare feat in deck-building games where it usually just feels like you are doing card-driven math.  In addition, as in Canterbury, the quality of the components are very high. Highly recommended.

I like deck-building, but this seemed a little too fiddly -- too many rules to keep track of. I liked the theme, but it was pretty easy to ignore. Went a lot smoother in game #2. Tried with four, and it goes way too slow. Three is definitely the sweet spot. Definitely no chance of dethroning Puzzle Strike or Thunderstone.

Pros:

Unique deck building game where you gain cards by defeating monsters in a rock-paper-scissors format, fairytale/whimsical theme is done well, expansions add new mechanics and even more thematic elements.

Cons:

Set up and take down can be a pain because there are a lot of pieces. It can also take up a lot of room on the table.

Fantastiqa sort of feels like a super light Mage Knight with a fun Narnia-like theme. I want to enjoy this game more than I do, but it just never came off the shelf while I owned it. I just prefer other games when it comes to a deck-building experience.

The game itself is pretty good.  You have a deckbuilder that gives you multiple options to manage the luck of the draw, be it by committing cards to quests, releasing cards with money or acquiring artifact cards that do a sundry of things.  It definitely plays like a well-designed, balanced game.

The problem with Fantastiqa is the artwork.  It uses art from real painters of centuries past, and puts them inside a boring oval.  Not only the art itself is unappealing (unless you are an art connoisseur), but the board is completely boring and devoid of life. It was made to be practical, just six circles where you can place the six different landscapes, but the background is very uninspiring.

I am not really a fan of the whimsical, fairy-style theme of the game but it would have been much better if it had been accompanied by whimsical, cartoonish art.  I actually think the Glory to Rome artist would have been at home here...even the Munchkin one!  

Well, we are stuck with the art, so let's see if the meat of the game gives it enough legs to withstand the passage of time and the constant wave of newcomers to the boardgame hobby.

UPDATE:
The art direction was so off-putting, that mixed together with the meh-whimsicality sent this one to the trade offers.  There's a game in here, that could have been polished a little bit (wild luck swings) and made more serious or competitive with better artwork (yes, pay some artists!) and more engrossing fantasy.

[b]Fantastiqa[/b]

[i]I will start by saying this is an absolutely beautiful game, they did an excellent job choosing artwork that has a whimsical, folk tale feel to it.
I was happy to finally try the game, although at this point I have come to realize that I really don't care for the deck building mechanic.
As much as I wanted to love the game (I thought it would be a great gift for my older daughter) it fell flat.
I played a 2p game and it lasted over an hour and there really weren't many decisions to be made; the meaningful decisions were few an far between.

All that said I think many would find that Fantastiqa is a great intro into deck building, especially for a family.[/i]

While maybe not as theme linked as A Few Acres Of Snow, the board and location elements provide this with a sense of theme that's missing from the more pure deck-builders. I particularly liked the partnership game, which provides the ability to get together and swap cards, allowing for quicker specialisation in each deck. There's a long rule-book but the game play is quite simple ... spend the icons in your hand to move around the board (each move acquires the card that's blocking the road and any gem it may have), spend gems to acquire even better cards from special decks, aiming to improve your decks so that you can draw into multiple icons to beat quest cards, be they personal or open public quests, aiming to be the first one to finish X points of quests. Everyone loves quests and including them here as game objectives is a great move. The artifact cards you can acquire provide a host of different powers, so decks will take on different characteristics from game to game. The game also provides a lot of freedom in regards to providing two different reserves in which to store away cards (temporarily thinning your deck ... gems can also be used to permanently thin your deck) and the ability to keep or discard as many as you like from turn to turn. Freedom is good. Fantastiqa is very good.

RATING: N/A
What I liked:
- I like the deck-management+map concept
- Nice art, and high-quality components

What I didn't like:
- It encourages the play of (minor) screwage cards (the Espresso Dragon variant helps)
- 80 minutes was too long...should be 45 tops

NOTE: We played 4p with teams, but missed the rule that allows trading. That is a HUGE error, and because of that my experience in the learning game was basically invalid.  Almost every time my turn came around, it seemed like there was hardly anything productive I could do. That would not have been the case with trading available.

I agree with the BGG-voted weight of 2.5, a bit above Dominion.

This game really felt like "deckbuilding for kids".  It's inexplicably a team game with 4 players--I didn't really see why this was necessary.  I liked the romantic-period art they used, but some of it didn't fit that well (the Peaceful Dragon was in a totally different style, for example).  The game seems to encourage you do move your pawn around and add lots of cards to your deck--if you know deckbuilders, adding lots of bad card to your deck isn't a good way to win.  The cards themselves were very basic--generally they just had a number of icons.  The game is easy to learn and play and has a whimsical theme--probably great for introducing a child to the genre.  Experienced gamers will probably leave wanting something more.

Quite the different deck builder. It's maybe a bit on the random side, but the quests are fun and it's definitely unique. I'd love to eventually acquire the expansions, I just wish they didn't do it in such a money grabbing way.

Here is my breakdown of the expansions that I own and have played:

[b]A Wild Goose Chase, Espresso Dragons & Exclusive Artifacts:[/b] The wild goose chase part is okay. It's essentially there just to possibly buy you a turn when another player is going to win. It's not something I would always play with and found it the weakest part of the expansion. The espresso dragons are fun and easy to incorporate, but not a permanent addition. I'd play with them most of the time. The artifacts are permanently mixed in.

[b]Fantastiqal Landscapes:[/b] The gem bag is nice and the addition of the cloud crystal will probably be permanently mixed in. The castle and the paintings are maybe a once in a while thing. A bit fiddly and a bit too much to worry about.

[b]Curious Companions and Rarest Relics:[/b] Permanent addition but not likely to be played with when playing with new players.

[b]Audacious Artifacts:[/b] Permanent addition. Just more artifacts.

[b]The Abandoned Abbey:[/b] Have yet to play it.

I'm not sure who this game is supposed to be aimed at. It's too complicated for children, and too insipid for adults. Using spatulas to defeat dragons and completing idiotic "quests" for points... I felt like I was in some strange hell consisting of an episode of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic.

Beautiful deck builder that has a board in which you character moves and tries to defeat different fantastical creature after which they become part of your deck. The art is public domain but fits very nicely with the theme and production quality is stellar it has many expansions that greatly change the gameplay. Base game is great for introducing people to deck builders in lieu of dominion.

I  like the whimsical theme and classic art.  There is a fair amount of luck in the way creatures and quests come out. Usually that would be off-putting, as I enjoy longer term stategies. However, there there is still room for tactical play and I think good play does substantially affect the game outcome.  Also, my partner actively likes it, so that is a plus.

Have to reread the rules and play again before making a final judgement. Some strange mechanics, that's for sure :s

Edit 17/04/2013: Played it 3 times now, 2 times with 4 (in teams) and one 3-player. I like this game more and more. I'm especially fond of the team-play variant with 4, it gives an extra dimension to the game. With 3 you will however have more competition for the open quests.

A game I had bought on a whim when it was on CSI daily sale. I like interesting deck builders and it looked pretty. Pretty thematic is a bit confusing with the starting deck and the names of the items. I only played the team game and I had a good time with it. I am interested in trying the 2p game. Seems it has legs to stand on in terms of deck building so I look forward to it!

Unimpressed. My least favorite deck-builder. To some extent I just didn't enjoy the theme: unoriginal and overly-silly flavor text, nice artwork but little if any of it is original and the mix of styles was jarring. I found the take-that nature of some of the cards irritating, along with the degree of randomness. Too many occasions when you had to take huge risks just to hope to catch up with a player with an early lead.

RATING: 10
(Rating based on the Rucksack Edition)

Pros:
- High quality components
- Great (if strange) artwork
- Lots of interesting strategies to work on in-game, even via solo-play using variants
- Theme is very original and prevalent in the gameplay
- Easy to learn, hard to master, very puzzle-like

Cons:
- Every game we have played so far has been a lot longer than the game claims it should be, even when playing a 'short' game.  This might be because we are still terrible with our deck management but considering there was only one or two of us, I am concerned about how long a game might get with 4....

Note On Expansions:
Some of the expansion cards were cut a different size than the base game.  I had to hand cut them in order to get them to match as well as to be able to get them to fit into the sleeves. Also, some of the expansion components do not match materials with the base game even though the tokens are supposed to be the same kind of token as the base game.  I wonder if this has to do with the difference between the Enchanted and Rucksack editions.

Further Notes:
I wish I had the play board from the Enchanted Edition.  I miss having the little roads and such.  I think they make a clearer visual differentiation between the quests and the creatures.  I plan to see if I can get an image of it and make a playmat.

The simple gameplay with a deck building flavor and an INSANE theme is Fantastiqa in a nutshell.  Be warned you may just sit back and enjoy the view but remember there is a solid game in this box.

I keep telling myself that I need to stop unabashedly falling in love with games after just one play, but this game was made just for me.  It has all the whimsy of the books and movies I grew up on and still love (Hobbit, Princess Bride, Narnia, Labyrinth, etc), and a deck-building mechanic at its core.  It's light to medium, with adjustable difficulty levels that make it suitable for children or a more experienced game group.  I'm going to try to get this to the table often and talk about it a great deal to anyone who will listen.  Alf Seegert makes great games, and this one in particular is a peach.

RATING: 7
All I had really heard about this game was something about "Rock Paper Scissors" And having played it, I now know what was meant by that comment, but it was really really misleading.

The game is a deckbuilding game where you want to get cards into your hand that will give you symbols you can use to complete quests. Moving around the board requires cards of the appropriate type to subdue monsters on the paths. Those monsters are added to your discard pile and can be played for their symbols later on. Unfortunately, most of the monster cards on the path aren't so good, so you'll want to get gems to buy better ones and/or artifacts. And while there are some public quests, you'll want to get personal quests.

But getting to a place where you can buy creatures, artifacts and quests usually requires moving around the board and clogging your deck. Additionally, completing quests requires you to be in a certain location.

There's a good bit of luck in the game, depending on whether you get the right cards to play in your draw, whether the monster cards that come out are convenient for you to subdue or not and whether the cards you can buy are good or not. But the game is quick and better play mitigates the luck factor somewhat. It's not the deepest game out there, but it was fun.

I've only played once so my rating is provisional. When I first heard about Fantastiqa I was excited because this sounded exactly like the kind of fantasy game I wish existed - one, not based on panel van art and the endless slaughter of enemies and the lamentations of their women, but one based on children's portal fantasies where you go from the "real" world into a fantastic land where you have adventures. The art is perfect for me, it feels like a lost children's game from the past somehow brought into the present. The take on deckbuilding is much better then recent ones I've played with enough ingame mechanisms to control your hand and your deck. I think this is a real sleeper, and I can't wait to play it again.

I liked it. I liked it a hell of a lot. It's one of the few games I've ever given a 9 star rating to on BoardGameGeek. It'll be in my collection forever and will be one of my go-to games for some time to come. It may not be for everyone, but if you enjoy deck-building games, with a mix of neat mechanics that feel like a euro-style game but play very fast, you'll really enjoy this game. I played it two days ago and I'm already looking forward to the next time I get to put it on the table.

Very weak deck-builder with little redeeming value.  Game is overly complicated for no benefit, and the length is awkwardly short to the point it feels wrong and simply not well-tested.

What if you made a deck-building game, but made the deck-building part of it mostly irrelevant?

Perhaps it's because my only play was with the four player game with trading, but this was intensely unsatisfying.  luck of the draw was big, the game ended just as it was getting started.  Although the art is wonderfully evocative of the theme, the theme itself is strange, with symbols and names not corresponding in any kind of easily parsable way.  Unless you feel a need to play every deck-builder out there, this is one you can miss.

PERMANENT PLACE IN COLLECTION

Based on 1.5 plays. A genuinely charming game and a novel take on the deckbuilding genre. Lovely quirky theme, amazing component quality, moderately simple rules... Wonderful with two players.

The only downer is that I sometimes felt I spent a few turns drawing and dumping cards. That may have been because I didn't know how to build a good deck though.

Wanted to try this for a long time, but fairly disappointing. Very random and quite a bit of downtime even with 3 players as most of the board is randomly replaced between your turns - would be even worse with 4 players.

Somewhat interesting deckbuilding with a purpose to move around the board and complete quests, but the randomness and 'teleport anywhere' actions kills it.

Although deck building is not a mechanic I enjoy, unlike Dominion, this game is not a pure deck builder (it has other mechanics like set collection). The art is beautiful Pre Raphaelite style and I enjoy the whimsy and theme in this game. Enjoyable.

The world of deck building is possibly a little crowded, as ever since Magic & Dominion, designers have flocked to the mechanic and built all sorts of variants from it. Fantastiqa stood out to me as it offers something quite different to the usual dash for an engine and VP-buy staples of other games. It certainly won't be for everyone, especially with its art and quirky graphics. Nevertheless I feel these attributes really fit the theme and thematic would be a good way to describe what the game seems to do. It's not really about building engines but having fantastical adventures with creatures and magic. Perhaps less for the optimiser and more for the flighty daydreamer.

Not a bad game but theme/art too childish for serious gamers, and game too convoluted for children/light gamers.

Game has grown on me.  The first couple of times, I really had hard time thinking of what I should do next.  but playing through that, got me to the point where I feel like I have an idea, and never feel like I have nothing that I can do.

Deck building, hand management, adventure game. Get quests, artifacts or hire creatures in a strange and humorful world of imagination. Coordinate actions using items from your rucsack deck like toothbrushes or spatulas to string together moves that take out multiple encounters. Gather gems along the way. Smooth play.  Easy to teach to first timers. Kid friendly theme.

Unlike any other game I own. 
 Fantasiqa has chunky wooden pieces, delightful artwork and a spooky fairy-tale setting whose whimsical appearance tucks the deeper, strategic thinking of this game in a shadowy place that you will only see once you play.

This is not a heavy euro, not ameritrash, but a blend of mechanisms from both that together mesh into a light to medium weight game that is an enjoyable time of questing, collecting and journeying.

Five plays.  Very impressed and want to play much more.  My initial thoughts are that this is the most unique deck-builder I've ever played and extremely fun to play.  After a few more plays, I will post a written review.  :)

I found Fantastiqa to be extremely charming and whimsical. It’s not a brain-burner, but there are still interesting tactical choices to make. Like most deckbuilders, everyone starts with the same 10 or so cards. As the game goes on, though, players decks seem to be able to vary much more than the typical deckbuilder due to the different types of cards can be added to player decks. Players are racing to get a certain number of quest points through completing quest cards. Not only do you need to gather and play all the icons for the quests to complete them, but you also need to go to the correct region to complete it. This creates a pretty cool strategy and tactics puzzle. The deck-building elements, spatial aspect of the board, and multi-use cards all come together extraordinarily well into a neat package. Furthermore, the atmosphere of the game is really well done and not like any other game I’ve played. This is certainly not your run-of-the-mill deckbuilder – there’s a lot more going on here!

I have had the great fortune to play this game all along the way from its inception and I must say that it is A LOT OF FUN!  It has only gotten better since I first play tested it.  

I understand that the graphics kill it for some people either for fear that it inhibits game play or that they don't make the cut for some personal tastes, but a game is more than just how it appears.  I am not the biggest fan of the graphic design, but I can say that the lay out makes the game play wonderfully.  The mechanics are sound, clever and fun with a great deal of replay.  "Innovation" is another game that I didn't quite appreciate for its looks at first, but after playing it I couldn't stop - an example of a great game with offbeat graphic design.

For those that will pass on the game because it doesn't suit their preferred visual tastes, y'all are missing out on a great game, even though I understand what you're driving at.  I think the game is brilliant, one of Alf Seegert's best.  

Not always does the vision of the graphic designer grasp, with the same gravitas, the imagination of the game designer, but functionally they pair up just fine.  I am terribly excited to have a none prototype game in my hands to share and play with my friends!!  A great gateway game too!

Thank you for keeping up the great game design Alf!  And thank you Griffin Games for producing such a magical game, I f***ing love it!

Simple deckbuilder with mostly pretty art design, but the big problem I had with it was play time.  This goes on a good deal longer than it should for what's happening.  By the end, my eyes were glassing over with the repetition.

This game looks beautiful and is enjoyable to play just to look at. My wife and I enjoy 90% of the gameplay. The one thing we don't enjoy is how easy it is for me to win every time since the game is complex enough a strategic person has a serious advantage over a casual gamer. We're going to try out a cooperative variant which will hopefully make this game fun for the both of us.

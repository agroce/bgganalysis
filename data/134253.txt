Surprisingly addictive solo game.  Many solitaire games designed as such turn out to be puzzles that, once cracked, lose their charm.  No so with Hostage Negotiator.  Tens of plays in, I still want to give it another go with another combination and see what happens.

Game should get a healthy life extension from the booster packs in the works.  It also travels well.  Overall, this is a solid game to own and play.

A very quick and enjoyable solo game. I like the way the game plays and although it is heavily luck driven the speed makes it quick to set up again.

I include here all the expansions as they add small variations to keep the game fresh.

Still getting some of the rules down. Rules like “terror card says kill a hostage but they’re no hostages left, then flip one more red terror card but don’t resolve it” just got missed the first couple plays, but that situation didn’t come up so often.

Additionally, I think some of the abductor packs are a must, otherwise you can get through the content pretty quickly. 

Also, really glad I picked up the Negotiator packs, particularly the first one due to its inclusion of the unknown abductor. This card alone will bring a lot of replayability to the game.

Fun solitaire game that plays out in about 20 minutes or so.  Some decent strategy is needed but bad dice rolls will force you to lose no matter what.  You can alter the game rules slightly to make it a bit easier so as not to get too frustrated.  Good filler game at lunch -- it definitely can create a tense environment while you are trying to save the hostages!

+ Getting into the theme of this game is easy thanks to the excellent tie-in with the mechanics; Building a combo towards a big turn, and then having it work, is a very satisfying experience.
- The flavor text on the conversation cards are very lacking; The theme will definitely not be for everyone.

Three games in - and having lost all of them with decreasing ineptitude! - and it has passed that first hurdle: no glaring weaknesses. 

The aesthetic is effective given the scope and small footprint (the differentiated flavour for the hostages is suitably complex characterisation). The mechanisms feel sharp; you are strategically managing a hand to attempt to get better cards, relieve pressure, or reveal demands, at the cost of time. There are dice, and they are harsh, but at this stage they don't feel randomly unfair. For such a short play time (15 mins?), the solo dynamic is engaging, tense, and often despairingly abrupt. 

I have yet to play Friday, but this feels like a slicker Space Hulk - Death Angel, a game I still feel is pretty good. It lacks some of the complex decision-making of that game, but here the strategy is more controlled and chance better ameliorated. 

I grew tired of Mage Knight because of the significant investment required in time and space. I'm starting to like this genre of

First game I didn't push hard enough, only got one hostage out alive. My bad, next time I'll go harder!

Second game a squeaker (4 of 7 rescued).

4 game win in Turn 8 with Arkayne surrender after all hostages freed!

Next game I'll try another abductor.

The game is easy to learn and seems to have been well thought out.  The theme is original. The gameplay relies heavily on dice rolls with some opportunity for rerolls and to convert misses into successes.  A series of bad rolls can become a huge setback and can make the game seemingly unrecoverable.

meh--a dice fest.  Really not as thematic as you would think.  Set up game, chose a strategy, roll the dice:  success, you win!  Failure: you lose.  Shuffle the Terror deck and play again.  That's really about it.

Long time expecting for it. Before, I rated it a 9 but after playing it over and over again, I've seen this little gem as it shines. When playing I feel like I'm negotiating against an abductor. And each one of them make the game taste different. Some people complain about too many dice rolls but these give the feel of the desperation of the situation and how things changes in a minute, and, even though, how a perfect plan can turn into a complete failure because of the abductor's unexpected actions. 
There are few games thought as solo games and this one is a real MUST HAVE for all solo gamers out there.

This is a pretty enjoyable solitaire filler. It definitely has some tense moments as the lives of hostages hang in the balance. However, this one ultimately fell a little flat for me. It seemed like the decisions I was making had much less to do with the outcome of the game than the die rolls did. This one is okay, but it isn't great.

Update: I just couldn't deal with all the randomness. I felt like I had very little control of the outcome of this game, so I sold it.

***Need to play a few more times before I rate it***

Initial couple of plays, I find the game to be very challenging and that is in a good way.  I have been finding myself so focused on getting the threat meter down rather than trying to save the hostages that I ended up losing based on the threats.  It's something I am working through to find a good strategy to handle the abductor.  Overall, I really like this game.  In fact, I have put this game in my travel bag when I have to travel for work. Before giving a full rating, I want to run through it a couple more times.

After the first 6 games, I was ready to sell this game, as I'd rather play Space Hulk: Death Angel, if I want a shorter-play-time, tactical, dice-rolling game (which isn't one of the Hoplomachus games). Due to the comparative ease in set-up and shorter playtime, I stuck with it for a few more plays. I'm glad I did. The strategy and tactics involved in this game are more subtle than in Space Hulk: Death Angel. That subtlety is a strength in the game design, but does make it a bit difficult for this game to immediately shine.

At first, the dice seems to have too much influence on the outcome of the game. After playing some more, the subtle strategies and tactical decisions start becoming more natural. The outcome can still be decided by the dice, but your decisions as to which cards to play and which cards to buy have a strong influence on the outcome, as well. 

Your overall strategy does slightly vary for each abductor. However, the opening play for the initial hand seems fairly on rails for the base game. I look forward to opening the expansion packs, in the hope that they solve this minor issue.

As of now and for solo dice games, Hostage Negotiator, as compared to Space Hulk: Death Angel, loses on variability, but wins on play time, narrative, and set-up time (though both are light on set-up time).

Due to the apparent on-rails opening for the base game of Hostage Negotiator, this game, for now, will be rated equal to Space Hulk: Death Angel. Unlike Space Hulk: Death Angel, however, the rating of this game has room to grow, if the abductors in the expansions prove to increase the variability in the way I hope.

As an aside, I agree with a number of people in that the dice do feel strange. I make sure to deliberately shake and drop them (any effect that deliberateness has is likely to be only in my mind).

*Update May 2017: After playing more, the dice do have too much influence for me. In the end, it feels like the dice and terror cards decide the outcome, despite the card decisions you can make throughout the game. I would rather play Friday if I want a quick set-up solo game, or Space Hulk: Death Angel if I want some dice. Maybe I'll come back to it in a few months.

*Update, June 2017: This game continues to fall in my eyes. I want to remove the dice and substitute in Gloomhaven's attack modifier deck with additional purchasable cards that can be inserted into the modifier deck during the negotiation. The hand management and card drafting as combined with an unpredictable abductor and terror cards are interesting as a core concept, but the requirement of rolling 5 and 6s kills this game for me.

*Update July 2017: This will probably be my last update, but after I played a few States of Siege games, this game has some similarities that further cement the fact that Hostage Negotiator (HN) is not really for me (I vastly prefer the States of Siege games). Both HN and, we'll choose, Cruel Necessity have a card-driven action system where the board state changes upon flipping a card. You are then allowed to take a number of actions to mitigate the board state, plan for the future, etc., and the success of those actions is determined by dice rolls. In HN, you're given approximately one to two dozen actions throughout the game. In Cruel Necessity, you are going to perform about 100 actions. A few bad dice rolls has a huge impact on HN, as compared to a single dice roll in Cruel Necessity. Further, bad dice rolls feeds into having less dice and, due to CPs not carrying over between negotiation rounds, having less dice makes it harder to successfully adjust tactics to the "kill-the-hostage-taker" strategy.

After a few plays the game doesn't convince me. There is no atmosphere, just rolling some dice.

If you would compare it with solo games like Friday or Death Angel it falls short in story telling.

Perhaps good for a few minutes of diversion, but I doubt I will choose it as my first game to take with me on vacation.

And other games with under 60 minutes playing time are simply better (LotR LCG, Star Wars LCG etc... etc ...)

I usually hate games with dice, but I love this one.  It's got a great narrative arc to it, difficult strategic and tactical decisions, and plays quickly.  It's all about mitigating the risk of the dice by building the right hand with the right cards at the right time.

I've got this game setup in a drawer at work.  At least once a day, I close the door, open the drawer, and take down another abductor.

Highly recommended.

Fun little solitaire game. I ran through 4 games of this in about 45 minutes. Knowing when to discard cards for a success or when to purchase the possible game ending card make for some tense decisions in a very short timeframe. You can fall prey to horrible dice rolling and lose no matter how well your strategy is thought out. I will end of getting another set of the Negotiator cards and some more Abductor cards to give the game some much needed variety. Last note, it seems much easier to win by getting more than half of the hostages saved and then rescuing another one then by eliminating the Abductor. Keeper!!

Bought this in the Kickstarter cause I was really intrigued with how the game was going to work.  Enjoyed a few plays but eventually decided that good game play, let alone winning, required more focus on manipulating the game mechanics than the theme.  Nothing wrong with that, lots of Euros are essentially that, but it didn't float my boat.  I felt less like a Hostage Negotiator than a puzzle solver and the "narrative" didn't come to the fro regardless of winning or losing.

So, a clever game on a difficult subject (my hat's off to designer!) but I had little interest in playing again.  Sold

Difficult and tense, as any solo game should be.  The game flow definitely has a conversational feel to it, which is engaging.  The only negatives are that the resource management and abstract tracking can take you out of the moment occasionally.  It's also extremely short and can sometimes lack a solid narrative due to unexpected abruptness.

I'm also not a huge fan of the repetition the game offers. It doesn't feel particularly dynamic as you're continually rolling dice and repeating trying to grab better cards.

RATING: 2
So this game seems to have plenty of potential answers to the question what should I do now, but I can't seen any incentive to give any answer other than: reveal demands and then spam the threat level until they start releasing hostages and finally surrendering once all the hostages are freed. I say this because the game incentivises you to lower threat level as a route to victory and also to increase your odds of succeeding at threat rolls. 

So this game comes with tons of cards and options and I ignore about 80% of it because of a near mindless dominant strategy. How dominant? I won six out of seven games doing this against the first four abductors. So it works regardless of the differences between various abductors and works very well.

I like this game, but not sure I enjoy it. In my two games it was hard to feel like I was doing anything to improve my chances to win. The luck of the dice and the end of round terror cards really seemed to determine the game more than anything I could do. 

I think my problems with this game can be related to the card play this game has. The fact that the expensive cards are still one time use there is no deck building aspect here so if I spend 1 turn to get 1 good card and then the next round I fail with that card, then not only does something bad happen, I also lose the card and would have to buy it back. I get that may be thematic in terms of high risk / high reward with hostage negotiating, but essentially losing 2 turns plus the card to do that was painful. I'd rather feel like I was building an engine/relationship to combat the bad guy instead of a bunch of 1-time use abilities. 

The game is also rather fiddly to me having to keep track of what cards I discard for 1 conversation (likely to multiple piles) and what cards I can pick up for free next round. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.65
Several plays in and I really like it. Each game can be radically different than the next. A few bad rolls and Terror cards might push you into the more radical moves, like granting minor requests for water or media coverage all while preparing to tell your sniper to "Take the Shot!" The "flavor" of the 3 bad guy cards really adds to the game. Definitely interested in the expansions that add more baddies.
Engaging without being a brain burner.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The premise is nice, the flavour is there, but despite ways to limit the element of luck, to me this game is a luck-fest. If you like a game where you are punished by every failed dice-roll, where you get that very expensive card you need only to draw a "discard the highest value card in hand without effect" immediately after, with no possibility to play it, and see every other bit of your hard work ruined by bad luck (called "the unpredictable nature of a hostage taker" to use the game's flavour as an excuse for its mechanics), this is the game for you.

I am scoring it as high as I am because I like the flavour, the rules are straight-forward and the play time is short, so you can squeeze this game in rather easily. However, I get more frustration than fun out of it.

The first few games have made me feel at the mercy of the dice. You can spend turns building up to what feels like it will be a big turn but then roll badly and lose it all. 

It turned out what happened was that the dice are larger and heavier than I'm used to, so I wasn't rolling them very well--the same "you fail!" faces were coming up again and again. The time I played this game using a dice tower, things felt much more manageable, like I actually had a chance at winning. Even so, the way the dice can destroy several turns of building up doesn't feel fun.

I do tend to like tough solo games, so I expect my rating will go up over time for this one.

RATING: 5.5
Simple dice chucker solo game with a decent theme that actually compliments the mechanics quite well.  It's very luck-heavy so it's not something you will really strategize; since it's so dice-dependent, you're basically at the mercy of randomness with this one.  It's not a terrible piece of work, but there's plenty of solo games out there that are much more exciting to work through.

Some pros are that the cards are nice linen, the dice are custom etched, and the game plays in roughly 20-30 minutes, win or lose.

This isn't so much a game you "play", but one you pull out when you've got some time to kill and just wanna press your luck a little bit.

Things that would make it better: make abductors more unique; they only contribute the opening configuration and maybe a few cards, but otherwise you're always playing with the same set of everything else.

The game is OK, but at some point I started to hate the dice. In my opinion they have too much weight in dictating what happens in the game. Yes, I know, you can mitigate blah blah. Nothing matters when you only roll 1s, 2s and 3s... I got rid of it in the end.

A cool theme and a nice solo game, but so far it seems VERY luck driven (I think dice are particularly frustrating when they don't come your way), even compared to other games like Onirim. May rise in score when I adjust to this, and play the game for what it is... but if you're an unlucky roller you will definitely lose, even if you play perfectly, and I dislike that.

Hostage Negotiator packs the punch and tension of an 80's/90's action-thriller in a compact box.  For what could be very abstract mechanisms the game is presented in a very thematic manner in which everything makes sense.  You are fighting an uphill battle and it never seems like there is enough time (turns) as the game has been well play-tested to almost always be played down to the wire.  The tricky part is keeping a level-head and making the optimal choices in a game where nothing is certain.

A common complaint I've heard about Hostage Negotiator is that it is too random.  There is randomness, chaos and curve balls being thrown your way but I never feel stuck for options.  Interestingly enough it makes the game very reactive as you are dealing with things as they come, be it good or bad (Tip - If you think there are no good options, don't roll, discard to purchase new cards or end your turn earlier to have more options next turn).

I think of Hostage Negotiator as almost Elder Sign lite in regards to gameplay and feel.  It has all the tension, dice rolling and being up against brutal odds in a much shorter playing time.

The theme is captured well throughout the conversation cards and events. Even each of the Abductors have a unique back story and their own demands and setups. In the end, though, it may be a little too dice dependent for me to fully enjoy. However, I do appreciate how much theme this quick solitaire game manages to pull off.

This is a fantastic solo game.  The different abductors bring their own feel and effects to each game, so the replayability is high and new strategies need to always be considered.

However, if you're not a fan of always being at the mercy of dice rolls or mitigating risk against dice rolling, this is not the game for you.

There is also something to be said of the honest dread I feel when a hostage is killed.  I'm very impressed that this dice-rolling game had enough theme to pull that out of me.

I wasn't sure about replayability at first, but hey, it is one of those games where if you want to keep playing new content, you'll have to buy more (cheap as chips) new content - and Van Ryder is certainly dishing it up for you to buy.  Plus the difficulty is entirely tweakable if you want more of a challenge or a slightly different challenge with the as-shipped status quo.  You'll get good value either way.

What a great game this is.  I had the opportunity to participate in the playtest from early on.  Even then, this was a very solid, very fun game.  I would pull out the game to play once knowing it was too late for me to really start.  4 plays later I'd finally put it away and drag myself off to bed.  The game has that effect.  I kept finding myself wanting to try just one more time.

In this game you are trying to save hostages before the abductor kills them. If you can save at least half the hostages and either kill or capture the abductor, you win the game. 

I like it. When I first started to play I wasn't sure I'd like it at all. But it's quite fun taking the risk of the dice roll and carefully choosing the cards you want to purchase from your conversation points gained. How you play what you purchase (and re-coop from zero point cards) is fascinating. There's lots of luck in the die rolls, but there's some strategic planning in playing which makes it fun. If you play it well, you can gain extra die to roll, which gives your agent the edge in conversing with the abductor. The pressure is on though because time runs out when the Terror deck is used up. Terror deck represents the abductor doing something mean.

Very unique theme and mechanisms for this solo game. The theme works fantastically here. You are basically emulating being on the phone with a terrorist of some sort, most of which have provocative and oddball art which gives the game a ton of flavor. You have to use cards that represent language/bargaining tools to communicate with the terrorist and save hostages. It's pretty tough, you're definitely gaming the system trying to mitigate some luck to save as many as possible while keeping the terrorist stable. Pretty cool game, and one of the more fun solo games I've tried.

RATING: 8
There are so many things about this game that are just perfect (for any game, but especially for solitaire games) - 

1) Quick set-up 
2) Small footprint. This game sets up easily within a 2 x 2 foot area
3) Fast play time. The box says 15-30 minutes. I've found this to be accurate. 
4) There's enough luck to keep things exciting, but a lot of strategy and ways to mitigate risk. 
5) Perfect balance. In my experience most games have come down to the wire - on the last turn and a single die roll or two determine success. 

It's a challenge without being too frustrating and is fairly simple but with enough complexity to still be interesting.

Speaking of keeping things interesting, the expansion packs are very good and each add another element to the game (usually specific to that abductor). 

I highly recommend this game.

A game of minimizing risks, where you select a hand of cards representing various conversation options and then deploy them against a criminal who's taken hostages. You have to keep the criminal's mood good while simultaneously trying to extract the hostages with no deaths.

Not an easy game, especially since in the end everything is determined by very unforgiving die rolls. The best you can do is improve your odds and decide which risk to take.

Disclaimer: I'm not the target audience for most solo games. This one seems pretty good.

But okay, the deal here is that the dice really do hate you. That feeling of a genuinely malicious entity who does not want you to win-- rather than one who's just tirelessly trudging toward a destination you happen to be in the way of, like in Ghost Stories or Forbidden Island-- is something for the designer to be proud of creating. I guess I prefer my mechanical adversaries to be mischievous instead?

RATING: 6
Good concept, though overly reliant on dice results, of which the odds are weighted against the player.  People often state how difficult the game can be, though I feel the reported difficulty is almost entirely due to the way the dice work. 

Roll enough 5s and 6s to get more cards and dice that let you better roll 5s and 6s...   fail to roll 5s and 6s, and you start losing dice, meaning you must recover by rolling 5s and 6s on less dice.  

I'll agree that there is some decisions around the card play and hand crafting parts of the game, but the cards you can purchase during the game aren't very exciting, as they're just more "roll 5s and 6s or it doesn't work".

This game had the potential to be an excellent dedicated solo game, but it's tremendous reliance on dice rolls (and even the mitigating methods involve dice rolls to work!)has made it sometimes frustrating, as no matter how clever I play, the dice have the final word.

I hope they add more cards that do not require dice, perhaps having some cost to play (in addition to purchase).

This is a nice, little hand builder which gives me the same tense feeling as the better State of Siege games but with more theme. It has a small footprint and comes in a small box and my games can take anywhere from five to thirty minutes. The components are top-notch and layout of the rulebook and cards are great.

Pros:

- This game is highly thematic and creates an amazing narrative. It's wonderful to be able to tell your S.O. what happened in your game as she listens with polite indifference because she's trying to get ready for work and you got the day off and were up early and managed to get a few games in before she left in the morning. Telling people how you've scored 38 victory points by building a pretty good wheat engine is boring. Telling people how you saved 4 hostages and then the abductor killed one and you responded by playing a single card which allowed you to save the remaining hostages and kill the abductor in one smooth move is a great story and there are many of these great stories in this game.

- The game has a good amount of luck. This may be a con for some people but I find solo games need a good amount of luck to keep things interesting. If there wasn't any luck in solo games the game would become a puzzle that would eventually be solved and then shelved. The luck in this game allows some of your plans to go awry and some of your long shot gambles to succeed. Besides, it's a short game. If the dice hate you during a game just start up another game and play the same strategy. You lost 15 minutes because of bad rolls, not an entire evening. It's no big deal.

- It’s addictive. I always want to play one more game. Even when I win I want to play again and do better.



Cons:

- I find that all the flavor comes from the different abductors and unfortunately there are only three so even though they can be paired with different major demands and escape demands the games still play out relatively the same. Also there aren’t too many conversation cards. I understand that this was a Kickstarter and it is after all a small box but in my perfect world, Hostage Negotiator would have came in one of those big Fantasy Flight card game boxes with a bunch of conversation cards you could mix and match or draw at random for your game. Also the game would include dozens of Abductors and terror cards and demands and special rules and more depth. Maybe an option for epic sieges that play out in an hour or more. I understand that there are more abductor packs coming out which will add more variety to the game which I feel is lacking.


- Edward Quinn is too easy.

- 
- The 2nd In Command is thematically clunky and weird.

8/10 (with a chance the score will go up after I get my hands on more content)

Creating a solo game to play within 15-30 minutes is such a huge plus to me. 
As well and as far as I can tell, there's nothing needed to 'bling out' the game, either.
I colored the sides of the tableau black, but that's about it.

Though it is a grim and somber theme, I don't yet own anything like it in my game collection.

I usually don't like chancy games thus I am not a fan of dice rolling. I am okay with rolling multiple dice and being able to mitigate or re-roll, but just rolling 1-2 dice and sticking with it doesn't fly well with me.

In this game, I usually roll 2 dice that I have a chance to re-roll. Keyword "chance". I can fail again. I didn't like that. The game felt too random. I loved the theme though.

The theme is a bit strong for me but I really like the straightforward mechanics and quick playtime for this one.
I like the way a deck building sort of thing is going on here. More solo games should try something like this.
The main issue is the game is basically impossible due to bad dice rolls. You can play correctly but fail dismally. I totaly prefer solo games where strategy has more of a part to play. I would prefer this if I still had the tension of trying to meet the victory conditions but get beat by the game, not the dice.
Anyway, a great looking and fun little game.

Dice are punishing.  I don't usually fare well due to dice fate which can throw my strategy right out the window.  Flavor text really does capture the spirit of the negotiating process.  Nice components, especially  tactile feel and thickness of cards.  Although the rules aren't hard, some of the nuances in the rules can be overlooked pretty easily, and a poor dice roll can really deflate your chances.  Captures the feel of a negotiating process fairly well, and can suck you in with tense moments.

Just purchased on Amazon. First solo game, ever. We'll see how it goes. 

Arrived 8/27/16.  Long day so read thru the instructions and looking forward to a game tomorrow. 

Finally made it to the table.  Played twice. Both learning experiences.  The cards work in combo but not seeing it yet. Forgetting some options.  Game player is quicker than I imagined.  This one will definitely grow more interesting as I learn the cards and build a strategy. 

Played 4 solo, 2 with the starter terrorist and 2 with the school teacher.  Won one against the teacher. Game is tense.  I think there are some terror threat cards that are unbalanced and are needlessly punitive. I've removed one from my deck.  So much is luck because of the dice but the cards, especially the minor demands give you very playable options.  Keeping this at a 7 if only for the dice but need more plays to get a real feel for the game. 

Still on fence about the life of this one.  I think it's more about it being a solo. Wish there was someone to share the rolls with. Little luck with the dice. 

Happy to say my son is back from college for the weekend and was curious about this new game.  He has a great strategic mind, and he was out to beat this one. Frankly, I was frustrated and have not played in a few weeks. Needless to say, he came up with strategies and was winning within just a few tries.

RATING: 6
Hostage Negotiator is a bit of a guilty pleasure. It's not a great game as it has some serious flaws, the biggest of which is the way such a serious theme is handled. The game's light "luck-pushing" mechanics don't always create the tension one would expect from this theme. That said, the mechanics are interesting for a solo game (thought it's going to need some new cards to keep it fresh in the long-term). This title is best for solo gamers looking for something a bit different or fan of "luck-pushing" games (I'm slightly in the former and definitely in the latter, so this is a game I'll be keeping for a while).

Still giving it more plays. I've been hunting for a quick little solo game. I was hoping this was it, but the game overall feels a bit bland.

Surprising tense solo adventure has you playing the role of - you guessed it - a hostage negotiator.

Clever card play and a bit of dice luck contribute to your success - or lack thereof.

RATING: 3.5
Every tactical decision you make is moderated by the roll of the dice. This makes the entire game seem both rather tediously mechanical (play card, roll dice, play card, roll dice ad infinitum) and overly subject to chance. 

The rules provide a costly opportunity to alter some dice rolls, but it would be less frustrating if the player could interact more with the dice to give more feeling of control and less of blind luck. As it is, the game seems to stumble about like a drunk from good result to bad.

Muy buen juego para echar un rato. Con un setup fácil y rápido además de mantener durante la partida algo de tensión si te metes en la historia.

Update 6/7: Played this game again, lost, and really enjoyed it. Updated my score from 6 - 7.5. The reason isn't necessarily because it's not as finicky as I first thought, I actually think it can still be pretty swingy. However, the experience is one that has me coming back and thinking about the next game. This is the sign of a good game! Very enjoyable!

This is a hard one to rate. My first experience with it was really positive: I felt the pressure of time ticking down, I liked the way the dice rolled for me, and I liked the general mechanics of the game. The problem is that the dice rolls seem like that they can be super swingy, which could really ruin the experience for me in the future.

3 formas posibles de ganar:

1. Combinar las cartas de "Rescate menor" + "Lo que quería decir era..." permite liberar rehenes; además son cartas de precio bajo fáciles de adquirir.

2. Combinar las cartas de "Intenta mantener la calma" + "Lo que quería decir era..." para liberar rehenes reduciendo la amenaza al valor mínimo; cartas de coste 2 y 1 respectivamente.

3. Combinar las cartas "¡Dame sólo unos minutos más!" y "lo que quería decir era..." para ganar dinero y comprar cartas que permitan eliminar al secuestrador, como "Francotirador, Fuego!" de valor 7. Otra opción es utilizar cartas de petición del secuestrador que permitan coger sin coste cualquier carta de la reserva. Una vez está fuera de combate el secuestrador, el objetivo es liberar al último rehén de la reserva para que el 2º al mando se rinda, ya sea con el método 1 o el 2.

Las cartas de petición del secuestrador son una gran ayuda para el negociador, que tiene que saber elegir el preciso momento en el cual utilizarlas para sacarles el máximo provecho.

A partir de aquí, hay tantas combinaciones como al jugador se le ocurra probar, pero creo que estas 3 formas de ganar la partida son las más obvias,eficientes e igual de válidas.
Al final todo dependerá del azar de los dados y de la capacidad del jugador para visualizar el escenario y hacer buena gestión de cartas.

Nota: Poner boca abajo cartas de conversación para ganar puntos de conversación es algo muy necesario en la mayoría de partidas, por lo que hay que tener este factor muy en cuenta.

On my first play, I played against Edward Glinn and lost in 2 rounds because I rolled poorly and the threat level skyrocketed.

Rating based on solo play only.

Very good solo game; nicely themed, fast to play (never outstays its  welcome), difficult, involves luck but with ways to mitigate, and keeps a good amount of tension throughout. It IS a game where you roll dice for fail/pass checks, though, so I have to be in the right mood for it as it can be frustrating at times.

A great solo game. One of the best.

A bit like an ameri-style deckbuilder where you remove the cards each time you play them (to buy them back later).

[u]02-Jul-2015[/u]:  So I've played this game a lot already...but most of it was playtesting the third and fourth Abductor Packs, which haven't been released as of yet.  I recently received the physical version of the game, but I have yet to play it.  I feel like I have a good handle on the game though.  So take these comments as you wish.

I haven't played either of the first two Abductor Packs that came with the base game's Kickstarter delivery, but they look interesting.  If they are anything like the other two I playtested, I'm sure they will be exactly what I want from these additions...new ways to play the game through rules tweaks and new mechanisms.

As for the base game, I've had a love/hate relationship with it so far...although my feelings have eased up over time.  Overall, I think this is a good solo game.  The theme is unique and interesting, and the game's mechanisms work well within that subject matter.  It's not a deckbuilding game as it may look on the surface.  Cards can be bought, but they are a one-time use only and go back into the market for re-purchase on a future turn.

Cards are played on your turn and dice are rolled to determine their amount of success or failure.  This is where my frustration has come in the past.  Sometimes, you can do all the "right" things, but those dice just don't give you anything but failed results.  There are ways to mitigate this up to a point.  But if things are just bad that day, they're just bad.

The good thing, though, as the game plays quite quickly...15 minutes on average, I'd say. And that randomness does fit well with the theme, which I feel is the game's strongest feature.  There is definitely a good narrative flow to the game that makes it fun to play.  And I'd certainly say give this game a try if you're interested in solo games and want something different than your typical deckbuilder or tableau building game.

Overall, my first experience with Kickstarter turned out well.  It did take a while to receive the game, but I understand the world we live in these days with production and shipping times/concerns.  Congrats to AJ for a thematic solo game experience with a quick playtime and great additions in the Abductor Packs.

Easy to setup. Rulebook instructions are clear and concise. The game is very thematic. Gameplay is deep enough for me. Dice roll results force you to change your strategy every now and then.

This is a pretty solid solo game. The best thing I can say for it is the narrative that each game creates. You have a pretty well-defined individual serving as the villain, and your cards you play help to carry on a conversation with the Terror Cards being the reactions to what you do. It doesn't always make perfect sense, but I appreciate the flavor text and how thematic the whole experience is. Unfortunately, it is largely luck-based, which I can understand since it's a solo game. Without luck, a solo game will usually get old fast. However, this crosses the line of having unfair luck for me, and so it can be frustrating. It's not too bad though.

Finally played this game while covering a stretch of over night shifts up in a server room. Nothing much to do, so I played this. Fun game. The rulebook was well laid out and only took me around 20 minutes to learn. The theme comes through very well and you feel as though you have options to work with, and sometimes fail completely due to die rolls associated with an unreasonable threat. It really felt like I was at the whim of a hostage taker, yet with a good dialog and the ability to send the SWAT team in guns blazing when I had a good opportunity. The components are excellent, and so is the art. The box just pops! This is one of those themes, where even non-gamers think it sounds interesting!

I can't think of a con, other than that it doesn't support more players. That will prevent me from rating it a nine or a ten, but on the other hand that is exactly why I bought this; normally I prefer games for more people, but this game is great for special occasions/locations.
To be honest, twelve plays aren't that many for a short game like this; they were played in just three sessions total, but so far I'm very happy with this buy.

This is an under rated gem that I am thoroughly enjoying.  I was hesitant at first due to the serious and realistic nature of the theme, but the sensitive topics involved are handled well mechanically and really deserve more credit from the video reviews I have seen.  The expansion "Abductor Packs" are amazing and add new abductor specific mechanics AND additional card to the base game pools.  I had one of the most tense and thrilling game play experiences as I raced to get hostages off a bus speeding towards a cliff just across the international border.  It came down to a die roll and it was beautiful. Thanks Van Ryder Games!
[B]TTS Play:[/B] If I am short on time or know I'll have interruptions, I will play via TTS against the base game abductors - makes fitting in a session really easy. I would love to see the other abductors included eventually.

BOX INSERT: Van Ryder's Crime Wave expansion provides a full box storage solution with card dividers and foam spacers.

EXPANSIONS: Hostage Negotiator: Crime Wave Expansion and ALL released Abductor Packs (1-7)

Something about this theme makes me uncomfortable, and I've given up trying to get past the feeling.  I just don't like imagining hostages being executed.  The game is a good solitaire design, but not for me.  I might try it twice more to get it on the five and dime, but it will feel like a chore.

This game took a long, long time to grow on me, but is now one of my favorites. 
While it appears at first glance to be a luck fest where you absolutely need good dice rolls and card draws, that is not really the case. There is a deceptive amount of strategy in this game and a lot of it is very subtle and only emerges after repeated plays. It is usually possible to win, even without being very lucky. 

Final turns can be very chesslike - it doesn't happen in every game, but quite frequently you will need to see clever combos and play your cards in the right order to get the win to fall into place, and its often magical when these types of end games occur.  

The 3 villains in the base game all require slightly different strategies and their individual personalities come out nicely with just minor tweaks to the basic mechanics for each. It's difficult to not start role-playing in tour head when you're doing battle with these bad guys.

A very fun solo player game. Plenty of luck involved, but I like that each time you roll the dice you need to "prepare" for the worst. You do this by ordering which cards to play first, and purchasing cards that can mitigate bad luck. When I get this out, I rarely put it back after only 1 play. It's very satisfying to play a very close game, regardless of whether I won or lost. The story told through the demands etc. are engagingly dark. They wreak of popular fiction, but also are very reminiscent of real life tragedies. They build the theme very, very well.

6/28/15 Still not liking this game. Feel like it's just complete luck to even have a chance to win. You have 33% chance per die and really need the 2 success to do decently yet that's an even lower percentage. Getting 3 dice just seems impossible and it just feels like a total crapshoot. Will try with negotiation cards next game but I'm definitely not really liking this game. If I wanted to roll dice to see what happens, I'd rather play pathfinder.

A number of things to like (use of the cards, the balancing of the different things you want to do, quick set up and play time, made for solo play).

I'd like this game more if I could roll dice better. No amount of mitigation can save my epic roll failures. As a result, I start getting tired of losing. 13 plays and I've only ever beat the first abductor. If you can't roll, you can't win.

Smart solo game. Plays pretty quickly yet has tough meaty decisions. It is not very strategic, instead it is highly tactical. There is plenty of luck but good play will usually mitigate this--still some games you can make all the right moves and still will lose. I personally am not really bothered by this, but this is not a game for those who are. 

The theme is really on with this one, and the game even introduces abductors that aren't just straight up evil terrorists but instead represent the real life complexities and multitudes of abductors. It's a theme that nicely ties the game together. It is also a game that is quite expandable since your an always add new rules with each abductor to switch up the game and give it more variety and variability (which is indeed what they have done via many Abductor pack expansions). 

I'll continue to enjoy this as a shorter solo game. In many ways it reminds me of Friday, but whereas I eventually had "solved" Friday, Hostage Negotiator continues to offer new abductors to keep the gameplay interesting. I look forward to slowly opening each new Abductor expansions and playing a few more times.

Relies too heavily on dice and terror cards. What you do doesn't matter. Provided you CAN do it. Because the dice won't let you anyway.

It is very important for your enjoyment that you do not use the dice provided with the game as they are very poorly balanced. I can never do anything at all using them, but am always close to winning when using any other set of dice.

I can't get over how awesome this game is. The various abductor packs don't just add new faces; each abductor, whether in the base game or expansion packs, offers a new facet to the game, making every abductor a unique experience. I was afraid that the mechanic of playing the cards, which makes up the bulk of the game, would feel hollow, but the card text meshes very well with the card actions making it feel like a real conversation going on. And there are so many "extras" in this game: only a fraction of the many cards are used in any given game and pulled randomly, so the replayability is phenomenal. The tension is there as you watch your time slip away.

Seems easy enough at the start but boy things can turn in an instant.  Die roll is pretty heavy with this so for as serious as the theme is I think this one has to not be taken too seriously as sometime things just don't work your way.  Intriguing game that may have more depth than at first impression.  This one need more plays. 

Edit: after more plays this is definitely a game that need multiple plays to see the strategies.  It's still die heavy but using cards face down a the right time is often the key to success.  This one is growing on me and plays in about 15minutes once you get the hang of the cards.

Érdekes, nem szokott "gondot jelenteni" a játékok harcos/véres stb. témája, a Túsztárgyalónak azonban valami egészen fura pszihotikus behatása van :) Rendesen rossz érzés, mikor kivégeznek egy foglyot. Ezért nagyszerű a játék. Egészen jól visszaadja a túszdráma feszültségét.
Már az alapdoboz is igen változatos, és nem érzem, hogy mechanikussá/egyhangúvá válna-e valaha. Rengeteg módon lehet próbálkozni, habár igaz, a túszok kiszabadítására kevés lehetőséget kínál a tárgyalás pakli.
Egyszerű és tematikus a kockadobálás, és nem is agyatlan. Nyilván sok múlik a paklin, a kockákon (a szerencsén), de pont ezért tudja jól leképezni a valóságot. Nagyon jól egyensúlyoz a határon az egész. A játékos azt érzi, hogy ő irányít, míg közbe nem szól a Terror pakli, amikor jön egy váratlan esemény :D
A minőségi megvalósítás és a kompakt doboz is megér egy kalapemelést. (Sőt, a doboz már túlságosan is kompakt,  4 kieg csak beleszuszakolva fér el.)

 Super fluid gameplay, super thematic, dice rolls can be bad yes, but I feel like it also focuses on efficient hand management.

RATING: 6
Tense dice roller. Plays in about 10 minutes, so it's kind of addictive and tempting to set it up again for just one more go. Lots of rolls should go towards evening things out. At the end of the day I think I prefer Greenland and Phantom Leader for a solo dice roller and Friday for a card based solo game. There are some decent decisions here that can all go wrong based upon the roll of the dice, so there you go. Do your best. Compared to these other three games I have the feeling that the game is playing me more than I'm playing it. The luck of the Terror cards combined with the luck of the dice just runs the show. I'm mostly a passenger hopelessly trying to guide the narrative along a peaceful path, but the cards and dice are doing their damnedest to conspire against me.

The theme doesn't trouble me as much as some. Whether I'm trying to save a cat in Flash Point Fire Rescue, or playing SS troops in Advanced Squad Leader, they're all just games. By playing them I no more like cats than I support terrorists or Nazis. Certainly it feels more personal in Hostage Negotiator than usual, and I suspect that's because of the background story provided for each of the hostage takers. In the end the goal is the same - try and save as many of the hostages as you can and stop the hostage taker from getting away.

A decent game if you're one of the solo fans. Not one I'd bring out with the kids to play co-op - like we do with Friday - and that is because of the theme. At ten minutes a game it's sticking around in the collection.

I love playing games, but sometimes, I don't have anyone to play with.  Hostage Negotiator is a solo game that involves luck and strategy.  The luck comes from the roll of the dice.  The strategy part comes into play with the conversation card you may want to play or buy with conversation points.  The theme may be a little harsh for some players, but if you don't mind the theme, then go for it.  Its a fun, quick game that offers plenty of variability form choosing your abductor and the different demands that may be chosen.

Another one that I was quite excited to play until I got it. The game presents itself as some sort of tactical strategy game, but essentially it's a dice rolling luck-fest. Nothing you do really matters as your excellent decisions and plans can be laid to waste by a series of bad rolls. Rarely does this game come down to the wire (I've played many more times than I've logged), with most resulting in a breezy victory or a crushing defeat within a few rounds. Terrible.

Chucking the dice into the box works great! :D
Rolling them causes inordinate failure.

I like the different strategies that come up.
Certain moves can really benefit saving the hostages, but you have to be open on changing your tactics on the fly.

Things can go bad really quick too and steamroll to disaster.

Which really works well with the theme.

Although a grim theme, I did find it interesting and somewhat thematic. I still have found it to be pretty hard to beat, and I'm still not sure how to manage my hand. I'd like to feel that I have a bit more of a chance, and I sensed that my options were a bit too limited to make good progress, although perhaps that's necessary for the title. I did play it a couple of times, but I didn't find myself really feeling like I'd love to go out and try it again.

RATING: 6.5
An interesting little cards and dice game, where you cycle cards through, aiming to increase points and reduce a level scale.  The context is negotiating with an abductor of hostages, and the cards are played as part of your conversations with the perpetrator.  The game mechanics are fairly abstract, but the theme can be reinforced if you're willing to remind yourself of the factual events rather than just focus on the mechanics per se.  Nicely produced.  I quite enjoyed my first plays, and am expecting to enjoy it more as the mechanics and opportunities for strategy become more familiar.

Solitaire game of hostage negotiation: an abductor has taken hostages and the player must talk him or her down. Victory requires freeing at least half the hostages and killing or capturing the abductor within a certain timeframe.

It's a very tight design and the theme comes through strongly. Playing smalltalk cards grants conversation points (i.e. building a rapport), allowing the purchase and play of cards representing more difficult topics, such as requesting the release of hostages. Conceding to any of the abductor's demands gives a temporary advantage (some hostages freed or bonus conversation points) at a permanent cost, but failing to ask about or concede demands can also result in penalties. The hostage negotiator walks a fine line.

The difficulty from a gameplay perspective is that it's all very random. Some event cards give penalties for unrevealed demands, for example, while others penalize revealed demands not yet conceded. Moreover, most conversational gambits only succeed by die roll -- on 1-5 dice you aim for 1-2 successes (fives, sixes, and in some cases fours). Luck can be mitigated to some extent, but it's very possible that the abductor will simply refuse to be talked down. Generally, the better the possible positive outcome the worse the consequence for failure (e.g., ordering an all-out assault results in an instant loss if the roll fails). This is certainly thematic, but I'm not convinced it's enjoyable.

A related issue is that more dice are rolled when the threat level is lower (i.e. the abductor is more amenable), with a rich-get-richer effect: a few early successes in lowering the threat level make it easier to suceed later, while a few early failures make things much more difficult. Again, this is very thematic, and forces a (likewise thematic) recourse to more risky tactics. But there is frustratingly little control.

None of this represents a problem with the game per se, merely that I prefer my solitaire games to be more puzzling than random. Even with that bias, as a push-your-luck experience I have found Hostage Negotiator far more thematic and engaging than other heavily random solo experiences I've tried, like VPG's States of Siege series. A little roleplaying goes a long way.

There is significant variety in the base game box, with even more in the "abductor pack" expansions: CCG-style booster packs containing a new abductor with new demands, new conversation cards etc. There could be a lot of mileage in this one for someone who really digs the basic system.

Great solo game with loads of theme.
Even having lost a game I am ready to jump back in...
The game:
+ Sets up quickly
+ Plays quickly
+ Resets quickly
+ Interesting choices
- Luck of the dice Roll... can ruin a plan
- Foot print for the card market is a tad large but needed.
+ Unsleeved everything +4 expansions fits back in the box 
+ For me the game play evokes some strong emotions.

Lots of clever mechanics here that add to the thematic feel of the game. I especially like how the demand cards feel like a trade-off you don't want to make.

I don't think it is a bad game, I just didn't like it.  Simple mechanics are good.  Puzzles are fun.  Dice rolling is fun.  The puzzle-ness combined with dice rolling and building up for turns in order to hope for a good roll and try to mitigate bad rolls but in the end it could all be a failure... wasn't fun.  Though it is definitely thematic.

Wow.  A bit of an impulse buy, and one that has seriously rocked my world.  This provides a ton of narrative and drama in a small, quick-playing package.  I'm hooked.  Can't wait to pick up some more abductor packs, and the achievements are a nice touch.

A very cool solitaire experience  that does a great job with the theme -- I find myself talking soothingly to the board when the hostage taker is getting riled up and impatient.  I like that one often has to make a hard choice between trying to talk everyone out and going in fast and aggressive.  

A few little thematic details bug me: I'm not in love with the "Second in Command" as two of the three abductors seem like they'd be working alone.  I get it from a gameplay perspective (otherwise one would probably just go for a sniper shot, every time) but it feels a bit distracting.  And "winning" with a pile of dead hostages can feel a little hollow.  But maybe you don't know exactly how many people have been killed until it's all over?  I guess I'm fine with it.

Edit: Losing a little bit of luster for me (still eager to get the expansions, though.)  I had a great string of luck my first few games, but I've had several since where literally nothing goes right and through dumb luck the hostage-taker flips out and kills everyone.  Maybe as I get better I can avoid that kind of situation?

2nd Printing of the game via KS. I went in with this, because I was on the lookout for some solo deck builder that gives more depth than Friday - but this is more hand management than deck building. But since it is pure cards, it should make a good travel pack, too. First plays show a fun and fast die chucker with enough ways to influence the Resultat that it should work for me. Could take a place aside Space Hulk: Death Angels. Needs more plays but looks promising.

Good solo game.  Setup, play, and take down in 30 minutes. Great components, small-ish, and it's easy to learn. 
The game has replayability and variety, but I feel like it could've been more dynamic out of the box.  Fortunately abductor packs fix that..

RATING: 9
I have now played hostage negotiator about 20 times.  I have only played with the first 3 abductors (Arkayne, Scarbarough, and Quinn), but I do have the first 2 abductor packs.  I plan to break those out soon.

I find it interesting how the challenge of each negotiator swings and shifts between plays.  On my first play with Edward Quinn I succeeded in getting his son's operation. In my second play he killed everybody and fled.

Meanwhile my first 3 plays with Arkayne ended with a loss.  The dice in this game make it swingy, sometimes you have awesome luck, sometimes you don't.  There are however, ways to battle that.  I usually go into a game with the goal to reduce the threat level by pressing my luck with dice rolls. I actually get stuck in that way of thinking and ultimately lose the game because I never even consider getting cards that allow me more dice to roll.

That being said there are enough conversation cards to allow you to play the way you want, and give you a way to success, but it's up to you to utilize them in a way that will turn the ongoing conversation to your favor.

I believe the game is steeped in theme, but your mileage will vary here.  I really get into 'oh god I said the wrong thing, he's killing hostages' or "YES! talked him out of it!". It's really cool when I can get all of the hostages rescued, and I feel satisfaction when the abductor steps down (I have not had a victory through elimination yet).  I can see though, that some people may find this subject matter disturbing. Especially when an abductor kills everyone and runs away.  I believe the theme is awesome.

I feel that the rules are well written and easy to understand.  I've read the contents of the abductor packs and they seem to change the game quite a bit, without going overboard with special rules.

The cards are well made and feel good.  It's clear which die rolls give what effect.  The conversation cards are nice cool colors, the terror cards are vibrant orange/red. I'm only mentioning this because the colors convey a feeling, and were chosen well I believe. Really like the dice and meeples.  The board is functional and informative, it tracks the threat level, conversation points, and hostage pool quite well.

The box that this game comes in is very sturdy and worth mentioning. I have put the box through some abuse. It's still in great shape, I'm not setting out to destroy it, but I feel comfortable throwing it into my back pack, letting ot jostle around a bit, and knowing the contents within haven't shifted much, and the box hasn't come open.  There is enough room for everything in the box, I put the two abductor packs and dice into the top compartment, I shove the meeples under the insert next to the cards, and toss the rest of the cards into the card spot.  I believe I have more than enough room for abductor packs 3 and 4 when they arrive, so it should all fit in one box quite nicely.

To sum it up, I'm very pleased with this game.  I am not swayed by being a backer of the project. I have recieved perhaps 10 games from kickstarter and have absolutely hated some of them (which reminds me, I need to get my geek list updated!).  Hostage negotiator is the second or third one where I feel like I absolutely got my money's worth. I break this game out at work at lunch time, and before I know it, it's time to work again. It's a distraction for me, that I quite enjoy.

Well, it certainly feels like you're a hostage negotiator! I can't fault the game for it's incredibly tense gameplay and immersion, but staking everything on die rolls feels ultimately too chaotic for my tastes. 

Sure, you can make decisions about what cards to buy and what cards to throw away for more currency/occasional saves, but do they really matter in the long run? The answer seems to be no.

I just don't get the love for this game.  Someone in the 1-Player Guild suggested that you need to play the story out in your head that this game tells to fully enjoy it.  I love games that allow me to craft a story as I play, but Hostage Negotiator doesn't feel like it gives me this option; it provides the situation, and the dialogue, and leaves me to fill in a little bit of colour round the edges. This picture sums it up for me pretty well

Slightly more luck than I prefer, even in a game about mitigating luck, which this is. Death Angel's luck mitigation makes luck a minor factor, but Hostage Negotiator only lets you lessen it significantly. Very fun anyway. This is the first game I've played in which I didn't mind that luck was fairly significant.

Solo simulation of a hostage negotiation and rescue using card drafting and press your luck dice rolling.  Sort of a deck builder element as you build conversation points to acquire more powerful negotiation technique cards. I like how rounds terminate as phone hangups.  Much of the attention is focused on managing the perp's threat level which increases or decreases your dice pool which I like. Not typically a genre for me, some cards get repetitive, but it has amusing game play that definitely immerses you in the theme and pulls off the simulation.

RATING: 4
I was really interested in the theme of Hostage Negotiator. The theme did not disappoint.  Unfortunately the mechanics of the game just didn't hold up.  There appears to be one best strategy in the game raher than situational based decisions that keep you thinking what you should do.  As a result all the games end up being the same.

The game is based on die rolls.  As a result, players will often start to consider how to mitigate the results of the die rolls.  This quickly leads to finding what is the most optimal strategy for 90% of your moves leaving you with very few actual decisions in the game.

WARNING: What I consider game breaking information below so proceed with caution!

The most powerful mitigation is reducing the threat to the "1-S" range.  At this point you get 3 dice.  A 50% increase!  That's a huge bump in making sure you at least get the middle level of each card.  Typically the middle of the card is acceptable and you only really need to avoid the bottom of the card.  Sometimes the top is substantially better than the middle, but that is not often the case and very situational.  So in most cases, you only need one successful result.


On 2 die you have 20 results with at least one success and 9 results that are complete failures (no change of saving), and 7 results where you can spend two cards to make one results a success.  So assuming you don't want to waste your cards changing a die roll, you have a 20/36 (55.5%) chance of at least one success.  

On 3 die you have 152/216 results with at least one success (70%).  If you have the two cards to spare in a clutch situation, you raise your odds to 180/216 (83.3%) of at least one success.  

The transition between 55.5% and 70% is huge.  But to make matters worse, there is a rule that if the threat level is "S" and the results of a card/die roll would have caused the threat level to decrease, you rescue hostages equal to the amount the threat would have decreased and if there are no hostages left, the abductor surrenders.  This game rule takes what is already your statistically best move, and makes it that much better.  It pretty much devolves the game to just reducing threat constantly.  And even if you felt like taking the route of taking out the abductor, because of the second in command card you have to free the hostages first to have a chance at winning (at a minimum half and have some way to force the last one out since he will not kill them) and the quickest and most successful way of doing that is reducing the threat until they start popping out left and right.


If you happen to get the +4 threat card, this might change your play to use some of the raiding cards to get you over the halfway point, but this not often the case.

So yeah, there is a way to mitigate the luck, but it also pretty much breaks the game in my opinion.  I really wanted to like this game, but after playing through a few dozen times, I'm bored with it.  The realistic options you have are much more limited than other solo games and complexity of the decisions is much lower as well.﻿

With all that said, I do have two of the expansions, though I haven't played them yet.  I read through the rules and it doesn't feel like they are likely to change what I feel is broken with this game enough to make it worth playing, but I could be wrong.

This isn't a terrible game by any means, just a bit too transparently random.  The game seems to come down to a very small number of important dice rolls, meaning that winning or losing seems to be as much to do with chance as strategy.

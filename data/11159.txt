I failed several "Lord-give-me-Strength-plus-2" rolls hacking my way through the initial reading of the included rules leaflet, but with the aid of all the files available here the initial fog lifted. The other mistake I made was expecting that stand-alone means substantial, but as it comes venturing into the Haunted Woods feels more like clearing someone's walled garden from some snappy vines than venturing into a vast forest. It is obvious that this set will only flourish in combination with the other available sets, and compared to those, the perils on offer here are, on the whole, less lethal, making this a reasonable introduction set to get used to the flow of the thing.

I do want to like these dungeon crawls, and there is a lot to be said for using an expandable card system to set up a great variety of "maps", and inject a healthy supply of new monsters and gadgets before the old lot runs stale. When new sets arrive it is often the surprising "combos" with cards from other sets that can create memorable encounters, but we haven't experienced that yet with this one.

In a way I am glad they have avoided the trap of constantly inventing new rules "to spice things up". Instead it relies on old fans who want to add "more of the same, looking just different enough", and this set certainly delivers that. There is something relaxing and reassuring about knowing I am able to add a new set without having to relearn the game from scratch. This set also feels a bit more thought-through on the narrative side than some of its earlier brothers, but I still regret that the Dungeoneer series is whimsically thin on villains that haunt you from setting to setting.

I am probably also overly plagued by fond memories of heading head-first into the ICE Middle Earth CCG when that first came onto the scene, and compared to that breathtakingly vivid narrative gem, it is hard to get overly excited by any titles of the current outburst of "mappy" fantasy role-playing-light location card games. I try, as I do have a weak spot for the genre, but in the end this is just another set, added to a game that wasn't all too brilliant to start with. I like they are not pimping it up with additional furry dice for the sake of adding something new alone, and just stick to the format that we know to expect. But you'd think by now they'd figured out how to write up the fairly simple rules more clearly. It's my "bane" with this game, still.

As stand-alones, these thin expansion are a bit bare-boned. And a permanent Curse Point docked for making me read the rules booklet in its original form.

I tried to like it but it did not work... I love dungeoncrawling and games like Dungeonquest, Heroquest and so on, but this one could not impress me... Maybe it is just because we played it wrong (The rulebook is a MESS!) but many mechanics just felt more complicated than they needed to be and too abstract for the theme of the game (For example: Why is a hero able to explore a new area of the dungeon while standing completely somewhere else? Any many more things like this...

A great idea that doesn't always work. The cards are nicely done. There are a lot of things I really like about this game, but it definitely has some problems.

The real problem is that it is far too complex for a game that is supposed to be simple - there is just too much to keep track of.

I think this particular set of Dungeoneer has the best feel/mood of any of the sets.

After many attempts of eeking a good game out of this, I have given up. The game is just too unbalanced and complex for what it is.

I like the novelty of Dungeoneer being a card game, but it just can't compete with true dungeon crawlers (though I'll always have a place for it on my shelf). I thought that I would really like this set compared to the others, but the fact that it's just a half sized set means that they couldn't flesh it out as much as they should have. I think they should make another forest set to "finish" this one.
It's ironic but, I feel fine with the "dungeon" sets, but in the forest set I feel claustrophobic.

RATING: 5
The rules for this game could be simplified somewhat - here's my suggestion:
Rule 1) Find out who goes first
Rule 2) Whoever goes first, wins the game.

At least this was the case in the couple of games we played...It was always the case that the player who began the game won, and the player who came second would have won if he....well, if he had started....

Dungeoneer - somewhere there might be a good game in it, but it isn't yet quite there somehow...

RATING: 6
Played once.  I like Dungeoneer (see my comments under the Dungeon sets), but this one falls a little flat if played by itself.  Yes, it's fast as a two player game, but I just don't feel that there are enough cards here.  Best combined with another set (either another wilderness set or with a dungeon set).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
See my comments about Tomb of the Lich Lord for my opinion on Dungeoneer as a whole. 

For Haunted Woods of Malthorin:

This 2-player standalone expansion for Dungeoneer is probably the easiest of all of the sets to play. The hero cards and treasures here are notably powerful, and the monsters' difficulty is a step down from that of Den of the Wererats (the other 2-player expansion). I usually use this set to teach someone how to play Dungeoneer; it plays quickly due to a small map, and the quests are a lot of fun to complete. 

I enjoy the artwork on all of the sets, but Haunted Woods of Malthorin is my favorite. Thomas Denmark did an excellent job with these cards; they're just as much fun to look at as they are to play with.

RATING: 6.5
Bundled with 'Den of the Wererats' in one box (named 'Zemsta Malthorina') in Polish edition.  The only logical solution considering very modest quantity of cards.

It's basically the same experience as the first entry of the Dungeoneer series (see my comments on 'Dungeoneer: Tomb of the Lich Lord'), but for some reason this part is less compelling for me (flavour? ideas on cards? not being as familiar with cards as in case of TotLL?...).  Hence the rating lower by 0.5.

RATING: 6
[2007.Apr.12] This is fun adventure game that takes you back to your early days playing D&D. The entire game (and the game series itself) is played using cards. You build the map as you play, discover treasures to use, and battle any 'bad guys' that your opponent may throw at you! It's a light-hearted fun game, that is by no means mindless or easy. The one gripe that I have--one of personal taste--is that the cards could have been designed to be a little more appealing to the eye.  Other than this, the game is great filler game when you don't have the time to delve into a longer adventure game.

2p, 45m.  Bought on a whim as attempted antidote to WoWtcg in February 2007.  The graphic design is simply dry, and doesn't do justice to the card art itself which is pretty evocative.  The RPG theme is just too geeky for me.

Traded away for Bali in April 2007.

Dungeoneer is a card-driven "dungeon" delving role playing game where players build the map, complete quests, and accumulate glory and peril as they traverse the map.  Glory is spent by the player to gain items and abilities for their own hero, while peril is spent by their opponents to cause them to overcome traps and face monsters.  Players always know how much peril and glory they have accumulated, thus they can know how much opposition they may face.  Each game is a standalone game but they can be combined.

I bought this thinking it might be a good alternative to Runebound for my GF and I when we wanted to play something shorter (like on a weeknight).  Then it went unplayed for several weeks, and I began to suspect I would be disappointed.  We finally got it to the table, and in the end it's pretty much what I wanted - a shorter alternative to Runebound.  I like the fact that all the decks are compatible, and that the combination of map layout and variable quests will keep replay value up.  The terrible rulebook is a weakness, but once you've played through a couple of turns you'll rarely need it.

Dungeoneer is a Dungeoncrawler compressed into a deck of cards. Surprisingly it didn't lose any theme by getting compacted. Gameplay is easy to learn and enables you to explore a dungeon that is built during the game and leads you to the goal of your personal quest.
The artwork in this set is tremendous and all the cards, especially the dungeon cards are very diverse.
The game is highly interactive and has fun "take-that" elements.

The Dungeoneer series is an interesting take on dungeon-crawl board games. The pros about this type is that it is less expensive, customizable, and not as time consuming (1 hour compared to 3 hours typical). The cons include limited options with a single pack, run-away leader syndrom (but isn't that typical for dungeon crawl?), and you don't get as nice of bits.

Haunted Woods is a great wilderness expansion. Art is incredible as with all the Dungeoneer line.

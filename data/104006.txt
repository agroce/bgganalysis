A thematic and surprisingly original take on the tried and true worker placement genre.

As per usual, the goal of the game is to score the most points by game end, and there are many ways to score these points.  You start the game with a player mat which has a clock of sorts that marks the passage of time depending upon the actions that you take.  Your actions consist of taking an action cube (which is a currency of sorts and which comes in 5 colours) and then performing that action, and depending on the action you may also have to spend time and/or grain which is another form of currency.  Actions consist of such things as: currying favour in the city council, entering the priesthood, selling goods at the market, travelling/adventuring, crafting goods or paying a craftsman to make them for you, and having a child.  The trick is that your workers have an expiry date, and when their time is up, they die and are removed from the game.  The neat catch is that in addition to this being a trigger for game end (the cemetary or book of legends fills up with the deceased) it can also be one of the many ways to score points- if you manage to die at the right time and place you can put your deceased family member in a book of legends which is worth more points the more family members you get in there.

The ways to score points are myriad: dying (appropriately), adventuring, working your way up the ranks in the church, selling goods at the market, maintaining a high position in city council.  The game can play quickly or long depending on what players are working towards.  You can win with many or few family members, the scalability is great for 2-4 (and now 5 with the expansion), and the artwork is nice and the theme fits nicely.  

Own the [boardgame=136223]Village Inn[/boardgame] and [boardgame=155996]Village Port[/boardgame] expansions and the [boardgame=124118]Customers[/boardgame], [boardgame=166592]Customers 2[/boardgame] and [boardgame=168122]Schatzkiste[/boardgame] promos.  The Village Inn is an easy add-on and should be considered essential.  It adds components for up to 5 players and the game works well with 5, but it also adds a new location and set of options (the Beer maker and Inn/Tavern)- you can produce beer with one action (a craftsman action) and go to the tavern with another, and with this action you gain access to unique power cards (personalities) that give one-time in game bonuses or end game scoring bonuses.  Basically this option opens up more paths to explore without being unbalanced.

A rather unique but mechanically simple game. In village, you strive to build the most successful family, but time is working against you and you never have quite as much influence as you want. It is wonderfully thematic although occasionally bizarre in hilarious ways. Like for example, you can expand the family even if you don't have two family members, which inspired jokes around the table about how we're actually stealing babies dumped off at the steps of the church. Similarly, you can't help but wonder why the wagons keep on breaking... is your traveler racing them or something? There is slight disbalance that makes it hard for the travel strategy to win, but this issue is completely resolved by village port. Village Port also adds life goals, which are a perfect complement that makes the game yet more thematic and provides direction. I have also played village inn, which is very enjoyable and adds a new layer to the game. This is a game I will never play again without at least the village port expansion and I prefer to play it with both expansions are once, even with new players. The expansions bring this game up to a 10.

This beautiful complex worker placement game feels like a step forward from Stone Age and Ninjato, with its multiple paths to victory, story-evoking theme, and clever new mechanic whereby your workers die of old age scoring you victory points. It's a bit of a time investment, but doesn't outstay its welcome. I think this is a really excellent new game that brings something unique to the genre.

Update: Didn't hold my interest in the long run. Enjoyed 6 games very much, but they all started to feel very similar, despite trying the different strategies. Traded away, for Troyes, which is a fabulous game.

a unique take on action-selection, resource management, worker placement game. Quite similar to Orleans. You play as 4 generations of family, looking to make their mark in the village.
On your turn, you can choose between crafting goods (yellow), adding/calling back family member (purple in front of the temple), harvest in farmyard (purple), becoming priest in the temple (brown), becoming politician in council chamber (red), travelling (green) or serving customers in market by selling goods (blue). You take cube (green, pink, orange, brown, black) from the action spot as resource to your personal farmyard (if black cube, just advance your time tracker 2 spaces) and may do the action. A round will finish when all cubes are removed from the main board. Then, the mass ritual is performed to pick who will become priest in the temple.
The most unique & interesting element in this boardgame that piqued my interest to buy it is that one of your family members would die each time your time tracker crosses the bridge. You should plan their death well to make sure they would be put into the village chronicle & earn points by the end of the game. If not, they will just be buried in the normal grave behind the temple. Once either the chronicle/grave is full, the game ends.
I like this game. It does feel like you are controlling a family of meeples. My first game was around 3-4 full rounds, maybe 20-30 minutes per player. It's not as point salad as Feld games as I thought. It has relaxing theme & nice pacing. Just enough randomization for replayability. Certainly a keeper.

The meanest mechanism in the game would absolutely be the market, taking the action before your opponent can gather enough resources to be sold to the customers. Always love how vulnerable the meeples are in the game haha

RATING: 6.5
Gamer friends classify this as a solid game with nothing too original. I think it does have a few interesting new twists - not the death of meeples which folks seem to highlight, but the way you select resources to take actions. I like it but the over all impression is a large number of completely disconnected areas - a set of mechanic vectors jutting off in opposite directions. Despite that, it's a fine game in flow that I would play again, just not one that I feel I need to own.

Muy buen eurogame de dificultad media-baja, de colocación de trabajadores y gestión de recursos, en este caso atípicos como el tiempo, o habilidades, fe, conocimiento... las generaciónes de meplees van muriendo de viejas xD. Para matar meplees y que mueran con o sin dignidad xDDD Un euro con una vuelta de tuerca bastante original, en las partidas que he jugado siempre hemos terminado muy igualados de puntos. Puede llegar a ser familiar si no es el primer euro que se prueba.

I love this game.  To date it's my favorite Euro.  I enjoy the theme and the way it feels like you're building a dynasty.  I love the use of time as a resource, and the flexibility you have in either taking it slow or moving real fast to fill up the chronicle.  The various strategies seem well balanced.  I've seen every strategy used successfully.  And the game plays great with any number of players.  It's just as tight and tense with 2 as it is with 4.

I'm looking forward to the expansion, but the game certainly doesn't need it.  I just hope it doesn't detract from what's already an outstanding game.

Very much has a "Stone Age" feel to it, but really interesting mechanic with the dying meeples and all.  I've found that with the groups I play with it is a little more AP-inducing than Stone Age, although not really being a significantly heavier game.  

I'd be really interested to try the Port expansion for this, as the travel track as it stands in the original seems to be far to great an investment for the benefits provided.

RATING: 8
A well done action drafting game with a built in "mortality mechanic". In Village you try to ensure your family members die famous for the right things at the right time so that they are remembered in the village chronical and earn you points or that they end up in the right careers at the right time and love until the end of the game to also earn you points. The game is essentially about promoting your family in a village through different means and exploitation of resources and or time (time is a form of currency in the game and dries the mortality of your meeples). The more successful your family members are in certain careers while living, or remembered in death for what they contributed to the village, the better your score will be at the end of the game. Always worth a play in my mind.

Interesting gateway type worker placement/get resources/take actions to score points game with an unusual twist: a valid strategy is to kill off your workers! That's because filling up the scroll of honourable dead (or whatever it's called) gives you points.

Fun for non-hardcore gamers as it is easy to pick up strategy as you basically look at what others are doing and try to do something different.

Of the point generating spaces, the market seems to be needed in most games so there may be some "sameness" developing over time.

Still, a great game to play with family and friends who are casual gamers or may be just getting into more mid-weight games.

One major caveat: if you are colour deficient you will have a hard time with the board and the cubes. The orange and pink cube representations on the board are strangely similar and I have a difficult time telling them apart, especially on the travel section of the board.

This is a well-designed game with lots of neat mechanisms: some new, some old.  Unfortunately, it was long and just wasn't fun enough for the work put into it.  I think it's a good game, but it will be hard to get it to the table often.

Update: Upgraded to a 7, but I very well may not keep it.

Good game but not my favorite.  There are different engines with interconnecting pieces but they're not all equal and they're not all engaging.  Just doesn't grab me.  Maybe I need to play it more and see how it goes, but it wasn't a great experience and I don't feel that burning desire to immerse myself.  *shrug*  Maybe just not for me.

10/09/13:  I'm trying to figure out why I don't like this one.  It's a euro.  It's got an interconnected engine.  The engine is variable and there are a few different directions.  I *should* like this more than I do.

Maybe it's because the different engines are unequal.  Maybe because I haven't seen someone win without going heavy on the market.  Maybe it's because there actually aren't that many different engines (travel, market, chronicle, guys on the board).  Maybe it's because the first thing we do each round is the family action to get more guys.  Maybe it's because putting the wrong guy at the wrong place is ridiculously punishing.  Maybe it's because the end of the game just rushes into place.

I dunno, but I really am not a fan of this game.  I'll play it, but it's just not for me.

Played with the expansion in five players, I thought the game was a little too long because of the 5 player game and unfortunetly didn't know the game before and the expansion gave even more options to the game, so I was a little bit lost in my first game, liked the game so far, but need to play more to give an improved rating.

Edit: With a second play I enjoyed the game even more and I enjoyed the expansions this time, I had a little more focus on what I wanted to do, so I can say that this is one of the most thematic euros I've known and this is a great thing for an euro.

:cry: :snore: :snore: :snore:  Long and dry. I'm not a huge fan of economic resources-to-VP style euros, although this is probably the least unpleasant of the ones I've played. I might like it more if it actually played out in the advertised 60-90 minutes rather than the 180 minutes of hell my first game of this was... but I probably wouldn't want to risk the time on trying it again when I already have a half-dozen excellent and beloved games in the 2+ hour range that I'd rather play. 

I was originally going to call this an exquisitely crafted, finely-tuned, well-polished turd, but there's actually a decent game in there. It just takes way too much time and effort to extract that decent game.

Game owners, do yourself a favor, sticker your meeples before introducing others to this game, because nobody with stubby gamer fingers wants to start game night with a delicate 20 minute arts-and-crafts project. It just set a tone of "doing tedious things" that never really left when I played this game. 

Not an awful game but it just rubs my brain in the wrong way -- I have to go against all of my INTJ intuition to play it, and it makes it sort of mentally unpleasant.

A medium light reverse worker placement game. Very clear cut view of an elegant game system that works. Like all Eurogames, different ways to score has always been interesting, as if you are playing multiple different games all at the same time... Nothing that new, but the theme was refreshing and getting all the bits to work and gel together with color cubes was very well done.

Overall a very good 'light medium light' game, that is fun for multiple plays.

I love the way how this game tells a story. I feel like naming passing workers as they fulfil their purpose and find themselves spots in the graveyard.

Received as a birthday present in 2014.

A great game with a very interesting take on worker placement with the addition of the time mechanism. It's quite fun to put your meeples in the village chronicle as well as in the church bag and draw them out for mass (and I'm not religious). Definitely lots of choices and strategy. Can't wait to play again and to add the Village Inn expansion into it to see how it adds to game play.

I like the unusual approach to action selection with those coloured cubes and having your own farm. Also, the time mechanic is really clever in such a way that you should plan the death of your family to claim points.

Rules-wise, it's not exactly complicated; but boy, it can be fiddly! There is never a “This is the best action for me right now” moment: each action is but a step in a process, and each action will, in the short term, limit subsequent actions for both you and your opponents. And your choices may end up leading you in directions that you had not foreseen!  This is due to the randomness of the cube selection each round. No, Village is not a heavily random game; but what randomness it has results in excruciating decisions. It is a wonderful balance of strategy and tactics. You need a strategy, definitely; but you need to strategize keeping in mind the rapidly changing conditions created by you and your opponents. At least once a round (whether you end up winning or losing), you will be convinced that you’ve been doing the wrong thing! In spite of all that I’ve just said, though, the game is surprisingly lacking in analysis paralysis.
Negatives? Well, the colour selection of the cubes is appalling, and makes the game nigh near impossible for the colour blind, and is even a bit of a challenge at times for the rest of us! Also, the game end phase can be a long drawn-out affair, since someone has to trigger it, and it’s pretty easy avoiding triggering if you suspect that you still need to earn more VP’s.
Not heavily themed, except for the aging-of-the-meeple mechanic. If you find it too dry, play it with the “give-the-deceased-meeple-a-eulogy” variant.

Some very good ideas in there, especially the time mechanic, the chronicle, the graveyard and the countryside, but the rest feels like recycled Euro mechanics. Why do you take cubes when you chose an action? What's the logic behind the church actions? A bit too abstract for my taste, but I'm willing to give the game a second chance. I'm still surprised that it won the Spiel...

PROS 
- Time mechanic of your workers dying is new and interesting
- Not exactly traditional worker placement since you're not placing workers all the time
- All sorts of strategies to pursue and different options on what to do to win
- Colorful board
- The expansion makes it more fun and I'd say it's a requirement

CONS
- Theme is kind of there, but not as well as it could be
- The board is a little convoluted at times. It's hard to see the places where you can go

Felt overdesigned, to be honest.  Lots of moving parts that don't really do anything except get points and the occasional this that or the other thing, which means that a lot of your decisions end up feeling kind of pointless.  The main gimmick is cool and definitely unusual, but doesn't really add mechanical solidity to an alright game.

Lots of ways to score, resource cubes to spend, always wanting to do more than you are able, minimal player interaction (the usual taking stuff before an opponent), and a rustic medieval German setting.  If only there had been buildings to build, this would have been the archetypal euro game.  

That's perhaps a little unfair on Village.  The idea of time passing and death periodically claiming your workers is quite nicely implemented.  The sort of inverse worker placement - you take off a cube to perform an action - works well to limit the number of times each action can be taken and create tension.  And the game is quite faithful to its hackneyed theme.  Would I play it again?  Ye-e-es.

Production quality is excellent and the artwork is pleasingly evocative.

The game seems well-balanced, too.  Everything just comes together so nicely.  The death mechanic, which likely draws most people to the game in the first place (it did me), is unique and compelling.  The game is a bit daunting at first, given everything that's going on, but you'll figure it out a lot sooner than you might initially think.  The farmyard "profession", and how harvesting worked with respect to meeple placement on specific areas of the farmyard (or lackthereof, as it turns out), was a bit confusing for us at first, but other than that there were no real confusing aspects in the learning process.

Another game that stepped it up with a great expansion, this game's big draw of course is the timely demise of your workers to earn points.  As innovative as the gears and worker removal of Tzolk'in?  Maybe!  But overall the game just isn't quite as gripping.  Although .. I do love pulling cubes from bags.

Surprisingly thematic. I like that this game almost begs you to tell stories about your family. Wide open field of interesting options to pursue, but at the same time fairly simple and intuitive. Timing and tempo matters and players can drive the speed of the game, which are all aspects I like in games. This is a keeper for me. Just need to find players that enjoy it as much as I do. 

With the modular expansion options from Inn and Port it becomes a 10 for me. 

I love Lohausen's art. Especially on the villager and captain cards.

Curse you Richard Ham! We never thought we'd ever get into Eurogaming but with each installment of Rahdo Runs Through ... we become more enamored of them. This is well deserved as one of our favorite Euros. The idea of controlling generations of a medieval family is genius and makes for a game that has you thinking from start to finish. Be warned. You are gonna forget that that worker in the blacksmith is about to pass away and try to use him further. You have to to think a few moves ahead in this game. While that is not normally something we like it games here it makes things more entertaining and sometimes even comedic.

Love the theme of family and village life (lived interacting and competing with other villagers--i.e. players). The idea of collecting generations of meeples with which to stake your claims on the board is inspired! I love, too, the inclusion of the life and death mechanic, wherein players of earlier generations die (removed from play to village fame--or not) and subsequent generations are born (recruited) by taking a "family action" from the wedding party outside the church. Thought-provoking, thematic, wonderful!

This is one of my favorites. It's a euro style game with worker placement mechanics. Your meeples is borned in generations, and they die during the game. Just make shure they did something usefull while living and that they be honored to be written in the chronicle after death.
The game has different possible strategies to win, and you have to look out for what other players are doing.
Every turn you take a resource from a place on the board, and if you like do the actions possible at that place. I love how this makes you choose between what's most important; getting the right resource, doing a certain action or avoid another player from having that action or resource. Sometimes it's a great idea to get some plague, just to get rid of granddad.

Love the look and feel.  While I found it a far cry from thematic, I consider it to be a step up in the theme department from Caylus, a similar-looking cube pusher.  I really like the cube-removal action mechanic, and found the rest of the game pretty solid overall, if slightly wonky (e.g. the monastery and its horrible player aid).  Turns really flowed, and because the decision tree starts and ends at the same depth it didn't really change throughout the game.  We all thought that traveling seemed like a horrible idea initially, but one player went for it and the cube kickbacks did quite a bit to offset the cost.  Overall, a winner for me.

Worker placement games may have fallen from favor in recent years, but this game brings exciting play back to the board.  The game is a combination of several activities that each round presents as options.  the cube draw to perform an action works really well.  There are several paths to victory.  The time mechanism is actually quite brilliant.  There will be times when you want time to go slowly and times when you want it to go quickly.  Game components are well made.  The Kennerspiel prize was well placed on this title.

A Euro with enough theme, variety and depth to it that I found it fun, even when I find some games of this style a little dry. Having to 'retire' your workers by killing them and replacing them with another generation is pretty fun when you house rule little stories of their demises. Anyway this is a good time, with numerous paths to victory, I need to grab the xpac when I can find it at a good price, I've played that version with friends.

Large variety of paths to victory, all of them just calling out to be explored (don't yet know if some will prove to be consistently better choices). Specialization is very important, without falling for the trap of overspecialization, since you still need an engine. Key to winning seems to be awareness of time, and ways to speed up your progress at the lifetrack at the right moments. Some luck present in the church, but you have enough ability to influence it that it doesn't bother me.

Exceedingly good game.  We forgot some rules (as opposed to getting them wrong), but otherwise straightforward rules-wise.  Lots of interesting options, no obvious killer strategy,  and a requirement to semi-diversify.  Dying mechanic is different and thematic.  And fun!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
If the theme of killing off your old family members doesn't entice you... the gameplay just might. Mechanically speaking, this is a worker placement euro. But when players take actions, there is an additional cost not seen in most games... time. When you circle your board in time, you need to kill off the lowest value family member. 

Now, killing off family members can be both a bad thing and a good thing. On the negative side, many worker-placement tracks cost resources/time/actions to move up on... and loosing that particular worker can be especially hurtful. But on the positive side, there is a strong race element to kill family members in specific spots, which can be significant at the end of the game. Overall, it is very situational and forces you to plan ahead. Furthermore, workers dying is how the end-game is triggered, which allows players to manipulate the speed of the game based on what their opponents are doing. 

Overall, the game provides interesting tactical and strategic decisions within a rule set that isn't too difficult (medium to medium-light) and quite eloquent (very few exceptions to the rules). I like it quite a bit =).

Four games now.  First game I just couldn’t get my mind round it.  I’ve found others not liking it first play also, but telling them that was my experience, but that I am now enjoying it quite a bit.

I must admit I’ve stuck with the same strategy each time, five deaths (so accelerating deaths where possible – never buying with cubes, but taking time, and birthing workers from the board to get the deaths in the right places) coupled with completing the countryside.  So far its won each of the games so I guess I should try something different next time.  It’s also interesting that with this tactic, all the number one workers die, so workers placed early in the council and church won’t survive to the game end.  All good stuff.  Recommended.

Fantastic, even at just 2-players. Plenty of decision-making, tons of opportunity to competitively disrupt opponents, lots of on-the-fly re-plotting, and an awesome (and fairly unique) game mechanism makes for a blast of a time. Eager to try with three and four players.

UPDATE: Addition of two expansions (Village Inn & Village Port) adds quite a lot of strategy and flexible play. Highly recommended, certainly worthy of the Kennerspiel.

Rémisztő híreket hallottam a játék hosszáról, ehhez képest másfél óra alatt lement egy 4 fős parti úgy, hogy a másik vége feltételig sem volt sok hátra. Tehát a játék hossza kellemes csalódás, de nem ez az egyetlen érdeme, sőt! Ez a játék szerintem az egyik legjobb a 2011-es felhozatalból. Néhány jól bevált panel mellett egész jó új elemek is felbukkannak benne, pl. ötletes a kockaválasztással összekapcsolt akcióválasztás, és az emberek elhalálozása az "időköltség"-en keresztül (ez utóbbi a játék legjellegzetesebb része). Akár nagyon gyorsan is véget érhet egyébként egy parti. Nekem még jobban tetszene, ha nem lenne benne a zsákhúzogatós szerencsefaktor a kápolnánál, illetve ha nem lenne ennyire esetleges a befejezés időpontja. Mindezek ellenére is arra fogadok, hogy elég komolyan számítható a játék, talán még nyerő stratégia is.
A játék egyébként igényes, és bele tudom magam élni... Mindenkinek ajánlom!
---
A második parti után az az érzésem, hogy ebben a játékban nincs benne 10-20 parti, max 4-5. De továbbra sem értem, hogy lehet 4-5 óráig játszani, a 75 perc tökéletesen fedi a valóságot (4-en talán lehet 90 perc, ha nagyon kijátsszák...).

Stupidly good game (if you are not turned off by the theme of course)..I personally like it not being too much of an uber-thinky player and the game being rather (and potentially on who's playing) on the lighter side of complexity. While you can possibly start crunching numbers every turn if you want, I prefer playing for the ride..and this game DOES take you for a ride, every game saying a different story for your family, with multiple combinations of roads to victory being quasi-equivalent. Keeping your eye on the ending condition is also a mustm so that you don't remain with your eyes fixed on the ground wondering why your perfectly well planned turn got left in the middle, losing you the game in the process. Soooo keeping it in my collection.

I see why people consider it to be ground-breaking. It's a worker placement game where you don't actually place the workers. You bury them. Still I didn't think it was that accessible, and I didn't have a ton of fun playing either. I would play it again, but I'm not eager to. I don't think it's a game where "getting better at it" would add to my enjoyment of it.

Village is a very good game currently flying under the radar on BGG (it wasn't ready for Essen 2011, and hasn't had an US release yet, so that is quite understandable...): it could easily be considered one of the best medium weight euros of the last year!

Its core mechanic is worker placement (a favorite of mine), with a couple of interesting twists:
1. action selection and (part of the) resource acquisition are interwined and performed contestually, choosing one of the available resource cubes from one of the action spaces;
2. workers have a life span and actually die (many actions cost "hourglasses", and after paying a certain amount of time, one of the elders of your family passes away): there's some tension between the need to keep some key workers alive, and the need to bury them soon to be immortalized in the village chronicles.

The rules are well written and easy to understand and explain (after a couple of turns everyone but the most inexperienced non-gamer can play reasonably), the components are sturdy and well designed, there is a lot of ways to score points (and they appear balanced!), and lots of meaningful decisions in a reasonably short time-span.

Initial rating is 7.5, but it can go up if the game can stand repeated plays...

Game play is quite a bit of cascaded resource conversion: collect resources for use in creating other resources, and repeat as needed until the final conversion to victory points. That's not typically my preferred style of game, as I prefer to feel a sense of building something. However, this game is saved by the death mechanism and the cube bag pulls. The death mechanism helps ensure the game doesn't overstay its welcome. Would play again if presented the option.

Urrrrghhh...I'm drowning in meeple- and cube-pushing over here.  Methinks this is yet another case of built-up expectations not quite met.  I really thought I'd like this one, but after a couple of plays, it hasn't delivered.  I'd much rather play other worker placement games in my collection.  And the dying meeple gimmick is unique, but not anything that seriously makes it more entertaining.  I'll give it a few more goes, maybe.

*UPDATE* Somewhat like a fungus, this has grown on me since its first impression.  Still not ever my first choice, but the hubs thinks it's the cat's ass, so it stays.

I really enjoy the theme of Village, including the various crafts and professions that are represented in the timeframe that the game is based on. At first I thought of this as a worker placement, but it is really an action selection game along with some engine building. The way "units of time" are used in the game is very unique. I feel like there are several paths to victory. That always helps re-playability. Also, the speed of the game can vary quite a bit. One can do things to end the game earlier if you feel like that is to your advantage. It also seems to scale well. Finally, I'm very happy with the component quality.

First Play: Game structure seemed fragmented at first pass of the rules but the flow soon meshed together within the first round. A clever number of options to persue to gain points and a need to keep an eye on opponants actions. Not so many opportunities for screwage and more than one means to obtain resources so no one can strangle options long term.

There would appear to be multiple paths to vistory and i look forward to playing this again. Ordered via Boardgameguru.

Second Play: Yes initial feelings were on the money, there's alot to consider here and an absolute need to monitor your opponants options. Here is the opportunity for screwage and it must not be underestimated. This is a really lovely game.

Good, heavy eurogame with tons of resources, but actually you don't have to mind most of them. The thematics are not as strong as in Agricola, but that is the one this gets compared to. The time as a resource is interesting aspect and I like it.

Fint spil. Tematikken fungerer i spillet overordnet set. Man har et klart indtryk af at lede en familie gennem generationer i en by. Men ressourcemekanikken er undtagelsen fra det - man flytter farvede terninger rundt, men bringer ikke opsparede egenskaber i brug.

Village is a very good game.  It incorporates an interesting time mechanic where certain action cause a players time to pass which results in the death of their action pawns over the course of the game.  We tried the "Port" expansion and felt it improved on the base game.  We have now tried the "tavern" expansion as well.  I felt this one bogged the game down a bit (at least at first as players learn the cards).  I suspect the expansions may be a little overpowered (unbalanced) but I need more plays under my belt to know for sure.

Two plays and deserves more. Deeper than I had thought. Decisions early on become all the more important as the game goes on and first generations die off. Where the market is key, there are still many avenues for collecting points, death being an important one. Fantastic art design.

This is the most important "worker-placement" game on the market. It makes the sub-genre worth naming. If an interested person wanted to know what worker placement was all about, this should be the game recommended.

RATING: 10
Excellent game with deep strategy that rewards both planning ahead and flexibility.  It offers many paths to victory, all of which are remarkably well balanced, and give the game plenty of replay value.  And with its beautiful artwork and engaging theme, Village is a real home run.

This game is full of tough decisions; there are a lot of things to do in the village, but only so much you can actually accomplish before the game ends.  You must always weigh the opportunity cost of choosing one action before another because the action you don't choose might not be there on your next turn.  I should mention, however, that this tension is not accomplished in the normal worker placement way.  There is no blocking when it comes to placing your workers.  Rather there is a set amount of colored cubes in each general area of the board that denote the number of available actions, and these influence cubes double as a form of currency once they are picked up by the players.  Once all of the influence cubes are gone from a given area, that area is closed until the next round.  The game does offer one workaround to this in a pinch, but it involves spending three of your influence cubes which can be costly.

One of the strategic variables is in Village the length of the game itself, which will depend both on the number of players and on how quickly people run out their clocks and kill their workers.  If everyone uses influence cubes to accomplish their tasks, the game can be very long indeed, but if people choose to work their family members harder by using more time, the graves will fill faster and the game will end much sooner.  It is worth mentioning that in my experience the game usually lasts about 30-45 minutes per player, so the 75 minutes in the game description is a rather low estimate.

Another thing I like about this game is that the role of luck is kept to an absolute minimum.  Most of the variation will come from players responding to one anothers' strategies.  The better you can predict your opponents' strategies, the more you can plan ahead for yourself, and in some cases thwart or delay an opponent's plans.  The only downside to this is that more experienced players will most likely have a significant advantage over new players, but this is to be expected in a good strategy game.

The only surefire advice I can offer a new player is, perform family actions (grow your family) early and often, and don't let any one player dominate a single area of the board unchallenged.

I've played this once with 4 players and thought it was a decent game.  It has a lot of similar mechanics as other games with a few, clever, new mechanics like burying your people for points depending on where they are when they die.  I'll need to play it again to have a good feel for whether I'd want to keep playing this game or not.

I tried it again with 3 players this time and liked it.  I'd play it some more.  I like how the mechanics are put together and there are multiple ways to win.  Not bad.

Nice, a good, solid worker placement game with just the right feel of "so many things I want to do, but I wont get the chance to do all of them, which do I do first?"

Often in WP games, getting extra workers early gives you a powerful advantage. The cube-taking mechanism in this mitigates that issue nicely, whilst the death mechanism gives you a powerful incentive to keep growing and reducing your workers.

Behind all that are your very familar area-majority and triangular-scoring type mechanisms (probably too many of them if truth be told) but the innovative use of workers freshened the whole thing up enough to stop the over-familiarity being an issue.

Solid game.

You can try to convince me The Village is a thematic game but there’s no way I will agree: it’s just a dry and boring euro whose theme is nothing more than a convenient wrapping for its mechanics.

That said, I can agree with the committed eurogamer that, as far as his typical euro goes, The Village is a thematic game and even sports interesting features, such as letting your grandpas die while the new generations take their place.

Nonetheless The Village is still too cubes and economy-based (undoubtedly the market is overpowered) to be an enjoyable game and it’s even less fun since it prevents you from directly interfering with your opponents.

Lasting Impressions:
----------------------
This one continues to impress.  I really liked the game when it came out, but it probably didn't offer enough the explore (had it rated as a 7).  Then the expansion came out adding the villager cards, along with the beer good.  There seems to be many ways to win now, and no game ever seems to shake out the same.  This is one i see myself still playing 5 years for now.

Update 1:
----------------------
Added in the Village Port expansion.  It made an already very good, great.  Wow!  This makes traveling very interesting, and now there are SOOO many paths to victory, but at the same time, the game stays tight because of the cube allocation system.  I will never NOT play with all the expansions at this point.

Szenzációs mechanika. A hangulata fergeteges. Nagyon pörög a játék, mivel személyenként nem kell sok cselekedetet elvégezni. Sokféle stratégiát lehet kidolgozni és a különböző területek igen sok színt visznek a játékba. Mikor a színes kockák kikerülnek a táblára, csak azon kell aggódni, hogy az adott közbe hova nem tudunk menni ezért aztán bőven van min gondolkodni, de mégsem fogja meg a játékot. Kötelező darab.

// This is currently my favorite game. There's something
about the theme and mechanics that just works for me. The
combination of placing a worker and taking a resource while
trying to map out a pretty wide variety of paths in the
game - while also trying to effectively use your workers 
before they are removed from the game (and trying to remove
them at the optimal time) - makes this a great game. It's
also improved greatly by the first expansion.

A well balanced euro with an interesting death mechanic. But it's somewhat dry.
What makes it strong is that the different ways to gain points seem very balanced, but you need to be efficient about what you do. Since the board state is somewhat randomized each round, you'll always need to think of a clever way to do what you wanted to or even change your strategy to adapt.

Sometimes there can be bottlenecks in your opponenent's plan. Spotting those and blocking them can quickly become important. This demands a varied approach to the game that doesn't depend on a single thing.

One game, 2er.  
Village is a solid offering.  The game I played went by quickly.  As is typical of "worker placement" style games, the rounds are broken into placements that offer bite sized decisions.  Individual turns typically go pretty quickly once players have taken stock of what is on offer in a given round.  The mechanisms of the various spaces available are straightforward as well.  The whole thing comes together with just enough complexity in the interactions, and randomness in the cube draws for the rounds that it offers an interesting decision space without being overwhelming.  

Overall, I didn't come away desperate to play again, but would certainly be willing to play this.  Not exciting, but good enough to play.

Juego de gestión de recursos con un par de mecánicas bastante originales. En primer lugar, los recursos los obtienes al escoger la opción...(en lugar de colocar un trabajador, recoger un cubito de material). En segundo lugar, el paso del tiempo (algunas acciones implican un gasto de tiempo) provoca que los trabajadores se vayan muriendo. Cada jugador lleva "una familia" con cuatro generaciones.
Hay unas cuantas acciones (artesanos, mercado, concejo, pozo, boda, iglesia) y muchas formas de conseguir sumar puntos. La gestión de la muerte de tus trabajadores también es importante, porque determina la duración de la partida y además, te permite sumar puntos.

Es un juego muy original y divertido. Muy recomendable. No es dificil de jugar y creo que le gustará a todo el mundo.

Village is a really great worker placement style game with a cool generation mechanic. Do you want your worker to stay alive as long as possible and rank up in city hall or the church, or do you kill him off and claim one of the valuable town chronicle spaces?

Village did not impress  me much in my first play, but after playing it a second time with experienced players, I must confess I enjoyed it quite a bit. Players need to balance strategy and timing. Which action to pick in what order and when to retire workers can have a big impact. A better game than I first thought.

Worker placement, get some cubes, get an engine going, collect some tiles, convert them to VPs, blah, blah, blah.

What I did not like so much was the length of the game (over 2 hours) and the fact that there's so many things you can do. Too many choices during your turn generates AP even for the faster players. This said, I still enjoyed the experience and are waiting for further plays.

The theme - which I thought would be interesting - seemed in the end to be rather dry. Kind of disappointed in this game. But I'm not quite sure why. A second play made this game better. No big complaints.

Have yet to come across a Pegasus Spiele game that I've not enjoyed and village is another solid game. Enjoy the worker placement and racing to fill the chronicle track. Really engaging game and lot of interesting decisions to be made throughout the game. Not one I've requested to play yet, but can't see myself ever refusing to play either. My only criticism is the graphic design, which I find really distracting and off-putting. It's very busy and a lot of the buildings painted onto the board are a strange, jaunty angles which can look fairly odd to me, personally.

After a few more plays I'm starting to really like this game, especially way you interact with the other players (cubes, locations, deaths), unlike other games where a big part of the gameplay looks like a solo game. With more players it is more tactical than strategical, and a bit chaotic at that because of the randomness of cubes, which is why I gave it a 9.

A neat twist on worker placement, where you don't block opponents when you take an action, but actions are limited according to cubes available on the board. Having older workers die off early in the game really gives a different sense of pacing than other WP games, and forces you to think strategically, both according to which parts of the board you want to use and in terms of long term scoring. Since players are required to take cubes each turn, however, you also have to tweak your strategy once in a while in order to maximize your points. The Village Inn expansion is also great, and simple enough to teach to first time players.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Good medium-weight action selection (draft a ressource cube) / worker placement (invest a worker into a profession) game with some paths to victory.
++ The fact of having multiple generation of workers, that die, and to score this, is really innovative.
++ Using the notion of passing time as an alternative ressources to do stuff is really innovative as well and really well implemented in the game theme as passing time eventually kills your workers, in order of generation (oldest workers die first).
++ I really like that all the gameplay information is well blended on the board (action information are depicted clearly on the roof of buildings).
++ There are expansions available for this game (which is useful to refresh the game when we have overplayed it).


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- Although we should like everything about this game, it doesn't seem to have clicked as much as other game in this kind, probably due to the lack of an engine-building aspect (you're not building up your family, you just play them until they die).
-- The replayability seem to be limited without any expansions, as there seem to be only a few viable strategy to follow (at least in a 2-player game).
-- The colored cubes, although typical in a Euro and practical because we have to draw them blind for the setup, doesn't easily evoke the idea behind them (skill, faith, knowledge, etc.) and thus player just refer to them as brown cube, instead of Faith cube for example. It would have been awesome that they could have use some wooden disks with silkscreen on it with images that could have convey the theme better (but I know this would have increase the costs).
-- The printing on the rule book and the board is a little bit sub par (the surface is rough instead of being smooth).
-- I hate having to put sticker on game parts (but I know why they do it instead of printing on the parts).

A really cool take on the worker placement mechanic, as it kind of takes the system and turns it upside down.

In reach round, action space are seeded with cubes, and on your turn, you take a cube from an action space and take that action.  When a space is out of cubes, that action can no longer be taken (I guess there is an exception to this, but in general this is true).  Additionally, the cubes you take matter, as there are several colors of cubes which you'll need as parts of the various actions.  So, in the end, not only do you have to balance which actions you need to take before they're gone, but also which cubes you'll need to make them work.

Yes, each player does have workers, but they're more of a resource that you'll need in order to do things, rather than being used in the traditional worker placement sense.  The real "worker placement" here is the taking of cubes from action spaces in order to take actions.

Under this very clever mechanism, you have your standard Euro "lots of options for scoring points and there's more to do than I'll have time to do" system.  So, the real uniqueness here is in the methodology to reach the goal.  The goals are all familiar.

Overall, just a really neat system that I really look forward to playing again.

Here is a game that is certainly OK.  I guess I wanted more story, or theme behind why I was doing anything.  You almost want your family to die out at certain points as well...  which doesn't sit well with me.  I admit it is quit an interesting game, with a lot of moving parts. Almost too many moving parts, that just benefits someone who understands those parts...  I made a couple of dumb moves, and Dustin made some very smart moves... so I might just be feeling sour grapes...

My friend, Spencer, described it as a good next step game and I might say it's a little quarter step after the next step from the first step of Ticket to Ride, but that's just splitting hairs for the sake of sounding mildly interesting...

An innovative rather light eurogame. The age mechanic about when your meeples die is quite unique as you really have to plan forward as to where you want the meeples to die (so they can get in the village chronicles)!

There are lots of different ways to score victory points, which is always a plus. However, it seems that you simply cannot ignore the market if you want to win; it gives you too many VPs compared to for instance travel. At least that's what I've seen in my games, and even though it might be a coincidence, the consensus on BGG seems to be that the market is stronger than most of the other actions and that you'll often win if you concentrate on doing well there. 
Nevertheless, you need to get some meeples in the chronicles too and preferably one or two in the church etc. While you do need to do a little bit of everything, the market is where the big points are scored (it seems). Because of this, I really cannot give it a better rating than 6; games which have a superior strategy simply aren't that good after all...

The game plays equally well with all player counts and doesn't take much more than an hour to play which is pretty good considering the hard decisions you need to make during the game.

Good game after first play. Interesting mechanic with the time track. Sometimes it's good to have your people die early and sometimes it's bad. I really like creative though behind the generations and teaching your people trades and letting them work. Village has a different feel than any other worker placement game i have played. There are lots of ways to win and lots of hard decisions to make.

Wonderful worker placement game. The time element is so frustratingly good and one of the most unique mechanics I've experienced in a board game. This and Belfort are in my top ten of all time. The variety of actions is always so interesting and you will really think twice about which action to choose. I love rushing to kill a few of my early generations just to get them to the village history. They aren't gonna last anyway, right?

RATING: 9
One of the few worker-placement games where your "workers" actually gain points for dying and being removed from the board.

The combination of the aging mechanism and the way to collect certain colored cubes, in conjunction with which action to take to gain the most of each move, really makes this an enjoyable game.  Lots of fun, and I must play it more.

This seems like fantastic entry into the worker placement genre.  It takes about fifteen minutes to learn and teach, but it is worth the effort.

I really took notice playing this game for several reasons.  One, though it has a worker placement mechanic, getting more guys to do more stuff is not that powerful, which is different for me especially considering there is a 'get another worker' space.  Two, there really isn't any engine to build in this game, even though most games like this have at least a little bit of one.  Three, I really liked management of your level 1 and 2 workers and how time as a resource forces them to be removed.  Good game, willing to play more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Village is a very enjoyable worker placement game. The twist is that, as you draft actions, you are also drafting resources. This means you have to weigh how bad you want the action in addition to what resources you need.

The other addition is that your workers eventually "die," migrating off the board. Certain scoring opportunities require your workers to stay on the board, so you have to plan around this attrition of your workers.

It's a slick design, I enjoyed it... but it may be just a little too difficult for new gamers. The playing time is very manageable... I don't know if I'm inclined to pick this up, but I'd happily play it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A solid worker placement game with a twist in that workers will eventually die and you'll lose their ability that has been helping you for a few rounds. It is definitely something to plan for as losing a worker in one area may hurt one of your other workers ability so you do need to spread around the board and try and do multiple things. The game took a round longer than we all thought because we were all able to stay alive when we for sure thought either the chronicle or graveyard would fill up so a little longer than I liked, but still the turns moved quickly. I was honestly a bit surprised by Village as I thought it would be pretty dry, but the death of your workers and the little bit of extra thought that goes into it proved to be fun. Definitely enjoyed this one.

:sugar: :( :D :D :D Puzzly cube-pusher of the sort I am not usually wild about but this one won me over with its charm (as charming as possible for a game whose elevator pitch is "Meeple Death"), accessibility (a few pages of nicely-presented rules) and brevity (90 minutes tops if everyone's paying attention). Pretty much everyone I've sprung this on (including the decidedly non-gamer spouse) has enjoyed it. There are many sources of points and the game makes it extraordinarily difficult to do well in all of them. Finding the ideal balance is extraordinarily tricky and the opportunity-cost calculations are not insignificant. Five games in, it seems that canny use of the market and the far points on the city hall track is quite strong and travel seems quite weak, relative to the resource cost.

I think that grinding on the mathematics (i.e., thinking through all of those opportunity costs) of Village will yield positive results w/r/t good play, but the fundamental system is light enough, and the rule set is well-enough integrated into the theme, that this game is suitable for casual gamers. At least, for casual gamers of a certain bent: apart from a little bit of blocking and some race mechanics, the game is conflict-free -- it makes Agricola seem like Risk, such is its commitment to non-nastiness.

Conclusion: if you're going to play one of the current wave of Caylus-with-training-wheels games, you could do a hell of a lot worse than this.

Easy to learn, hard to master to such an extent that you will make the right decision every time. Making the right decision is rewarded but there is also some luck involved. It is possible to thwart other players but only so much: there is almost always a way to get what you want. This means this game is great for those who tend to be frustrated by a fellow player who does nothing but harrass them in a game.

Well balanced and innovative worker placement game. Mostly about finding the right tactical plan (sequence of actions either to increase your payoff or to decrease that of your opponents. It's a standard "go where other people don't"  kind of game, but there are high-level strategic directions and combos one can follow. Overall, quite a thinky game, while not too difficult to learn. A real pleasure, especially when played when Village Inn (haven't played the Port yet).

Play with scoring market tiles as soon as you get them, no point in playing memory games...

Don't like: 
- the expansion board-lets that cover the board

Likes: Very interesting management of "time" that adds greatly to strategy. There is very little downtime, as each turn is a micro-action that leaves for very little analysis paralysis, yet the game as a whole is complex enough to satisfy my desires for a deeper strategy game. Gameplay feels fast and the game itself also fits a quicker time frame. Solid components and great art.

Dislikes: Wish the cubes represented something specific thematically rather than just matching colors. Also, the pictures skewed on the roofs of buildings does bother some people aesthetically. Oh and stickers, not a big fan of stickers, but they are probably the most practical solution to mark meeples that will have to be randomly drawn.

Thematically excellent Euro with a nice twist on the usual multiple ways to VP cube pushing efficiency. The simple mechanics work well and balancing the 'generations' of workers is fun. I think this is better than say, Stone Age. Would love to play again.

I was tempted to give a 9 because I found it a very very fun game, though my opinion is that you should play a game a few times before rating 9+.

There did seem to be different pads to victory, allthough 5 persons in the book occured to me as powerful.

First play was 2-player and very uneventful.  The action selection mechanic of taking a resource or plague cube was not very interesting.  The idea of time used as a resource and death as the ultimate penalty are fantastic.  The game around it was just not fun to play.

Action Selection / Worker Placement
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Yet another worker placement game but with a lovely twist: death! In this game your workers (family members) actually die after some time - with time itself being one of the currencies of the game system. So you will have to bring new generations of workers into play while trying to let the grim reaper take your elderly family members preferably in the prime of their life (thus securing a place in the village chronicle for them). The game seems balanced and comes with very well written rules that leave no question unanswered. The theme in most parts fits the variety of different mechanisms present in the game and the graphics and game components are nicely done. Only the attempt to match the perspective of the icons on the game board with the drawings done in perspective has gone utterly wrong. Those are painful to look at. If this game wasn't limited to a maximum of 4 players it would hit the table quite often. (This is for the German eggertspiele / Pegasus (2011) edition.)

Very nice game. And nice twist on action selection. Choose an action [b]and[/b] a cube there. Many actions require cubes, but you often can't take the cube you want when taking the action you want, so you have to manage the balance. But be careful or your people might die. Wait, that's actually a good thing! Or is it? I dunno! Wow I stink at this game. I think I'm suffering from some cognitive dissonance between what things seem they should be worth, and what they're really worth. Such as: "getting stuff", and minor things like "keeping your people alive". Very little randomness, except for setup each round, which is the sweet-spot for me. But minus .5 for the random draw of monks at mass. That's just overly random. Although I'm not sure how I'd fix it. But minor issue.

Forgettable, bland, totally run-of-the-mill worker placement. Yes: removing the cubes [i]is[/i] worker placement, just not with workers. The principle of action blocking and their dearth is still the same. I suppose that if this title is your first big(ger) specimen in this genre you will be enamoured by it: a nice timing mechanism, some blocking, some randomness to keep it light and not too difficult, apparently lots of strategies... But if you're a grizzled cynical bastard like me, you'll soon see that these 'strategies', while numerous, are not really challenging besides recognising and subsequently following them. There is very little in the way of creative thinking required here. The game is very mild in the way players can cause havoc with the plans of others: only the aspect which has some players actively striving to end the game earlier than others want by forcing their villagers to die quickly causes some interesting tension. Unfortunately I have a number of other titles which execute this tension much better than The Village (Luna, Coney Island, perhaps even the nasty Grand Cru), putting the game into the class of 'fun for once every while' for me. It remains somewhat of a mystery why this title is so popular.

RATING: 6
I need to play again before making too many judgments, but it feels like an economic workerplacement game which has a scripted feel to it. Unlike Agricola which has the random cards, this game does not have that random element so I would expect the game to become stale after players devise the optimum strategy.

This game has been a grower. Initially I was unimpressed, it lacked tension and the strategies seemed reasonably balanced and choice seemed merely a formality. Over time I've grown to appreciate the narrative qualities of the game. You can't help telling stories about the horrible things that happen to your family. The game definitely benefits from more players. 4-5 players with the expansion is the best way to play.

RATING: 8
This game is good. The artwork is nice and somehow wonderfully rustic (as it should be) in my opinion.

I've scored about five plays with it now and I admit I'm not very good in this game. Somehow someone else always manages to optimize their VP engine better, though I've usually been the close second. Despite this terrible flaw (heh) I've enjoyed all the plays.

The game mechanics are solid and there are multiple viable ways to victory. You won't have time to compete efficiently in all of them so you'll have to focus on one or two of them. The other players will be doing the same and thus a frantic game usually follows. The cubes are a nice touch of randomness to the game.

I rated this game a round 8. It's a good game but lacks that extra special 'oompf' to reach higher in my books.

On the surface this looked to be another game of simple worker placement, cube pushing, and point salad.  But as we got deeper into the game, I was charmed by how it all fits together so nicely.  The mechanism of your workers being born and later dying - and trying to kill them off strategically - is awfully clever.  Now I can see why it's been so popular and won the KdJ.

Village is a little bit challenging to learn, but once you've played through it once it will be far easier to teach going forward, so I recommend learning from someone with experience.

Also - we played with the expansion (see below) and can't imagine playing without it.  So for me this is really an 8, but knowing that excellent expansion is out there to improve it nudges it up for me in the ratings.  Now I just need to get a copy!

Second play with the gang last night. This is a MEATY game. Lots of that Euro-angst...should I do this or that? Many paths to victory-the City Hall bangs out some good rewards as does the church-the craft buildings suck up a LOT of time, but get you stuff qucikly, keep your eye on the market-you want to make at least 1 sale. Travel is good-even if yo dont get to a city first and get that mini-reward, the reward for visiting many is good. Trying to "save time" and not let your people die? Then they wont end up in the chronicle - also big points and CERTAINLY one reason I had such a poor showing last night. The church and the mass certainly add to the matter....this is a solid game, worker-placement with a twist ("No Mr. Bond, I expect you to DIE!")....certainly will make it to the table many more times this year. Glad I got it!

Worker placement game for 2-4 players with a nice twist: your workers will die over the course of the game and if you play it right, they will become part of the village chronicles. The game is quite accessible and takes about 10-15 minutes to explain and a 4 player games playes in 75-90 minutes (with experienced players probably 60-75).

I've played with 2,3 and 4 players and the games scales nicely to suit the player count. As I have nothing quite like it in my collection, this one is a keeper.

Sort of a mix of various Euro mechanics tacked onto a very dull theme with an even duller box cover. However, the gameplay is interesting enough to entertain gamers. Still, it's not something that I'll be craving to play all the time, but after one play, I'd be happy to play it again. It does have various paths to victory, so not every player will be doing the same thing.

Update after three plays: I like this one quite a bit for a medium weight game. It's got the scarcity that I tend to like in Euros, and the game is tense. Very balanced, as the various ways to score VPs all seem viable.

The theme in this game is really noteworthy.
I enjoyed the clever blend of the mechanics into the theme that also triggered the end game.
It is a game that needs a lot of precise planning to kill off your workers in the desired spots as well as preserving them on the correct spots.
It was really enjoyable with a lot of RNG in the seedings which led to many unfortunate/fortunate deceases on workers.

A variation on the worker placement mechanic. The game flows smoothly and our first play surprised us... a lot of things we expected to happen didn't happen and several unexpected things did.

The game looks like it has a theme, but the theme is pretty weak. Those cubes (essentially) mean nothing. Just color combos.

The game suffers a bit from what I've seen called "point salad", where almost everything is worth points in some way... this makes nothing seem particularly important. (In fact, there's a strategy of killing off all your workers as quickly as possible by taking plague cubes. This, too, rewards you with points by getting your workers into the town annals quickly... and ending the game before anyone can score many points of other kinds.)

The end game also has a frustrating issue. Workers are drawn randomly from a bag. The results of this draw can very, very easily decide the winner if the game is at all close. To have a medium-weight game come down to a coin flip is annoying to me.

Initial rating of 8 after two plays with three players.

A lot to like here - interesting "death" mechanics for meeples - tough choices throughout - many paths to victory - opportunities to play defence on other players.

Positive surprise despite all the awards this game has won. Sure it got that Euro-feel, but it plays out fast enough, there's just the right amount of thinking involved and most importantly the game is fun. I like the way you all jockey to have your people die at the right moment in the right place. 

Adds to the game when players goof around and tell each other what this and that person accomplished (or did not) to earn a spot in the book.

Besides the messy, ugly looking, and poorly laid out board, the game underneath is very good. However, I felt like there wasn't enough avenues to win, and I can see the game getting dull quickly.

Edit: After many more plays, I have raised my rating. I'll never turn a game of Village down. It's a solid game.

RATING: 8
Pretty good game.  You want to avoid taking the actions that everyone else is taking.   Seems to have some depth with a good amount of moving parts.  This is an early rating and I could see it go up or down by a point.

After 3 plays, bumping this up from a 7 to an 8.  The interesting thing about this is the game timing.  Some games go very fast with lots of workers going to the graveyards.  Others games can linger on which makes the right play difficult (and fun) to measure and estimate.

RATING: 8
Players run a family of villagers, working their way through village life, trying to gain prestige (victory points).  A straightforward game, but with a lot going on.  A turn is simply remove an available cube from an action pool, and take the corresponding action.  Actions are divided into craft (make stuff, or acquire livestock), agriculture (gain food), business (earn game rewards), church (prestige), travel (escalating prestige), and so on.  The cubes you take are coloured, and you have to pay back sets of colours to take other actions, so there is a cyclic synergy thing happening.  A lot of actions also take time, which is recorded on a private Thebes-like time track.  When a lap is completed, one of your village elders shuffles off to either the village chronicle (prestige points!) or a pauper's grave (nothing) - so you want to time your deaths well!  Really nice game - a beast to teach, but plays out very smoothly, and importantly, doesn't overstay it's welcome.  Very good.

Worker placement game in which your villagers eventually grow old and die, only to be replaced by members of the next generation.  Manufacture goods, sell to customers, advance your position in the village council or church, or gain fame by traveling.  Being among the first in a given profession to die of old age makes you more memorable, earning fame points.

An inverse worker placement game, where action cubes are sprinkled around the board in abundance.  Players remove cubes to trigger actions, which sometimes requires leaving a worker behind.   So there isn't a lot of blocking until later in each round.   The triangular scoring in different areas isn't particularly inspiring, and the thin and bland theme even less so.  So, it will come down to how much you like the action/cube mechanism and the time mechanism.  I like it enough to play some more, but don't feel compelled to own it.

There's tension from multi-turn plans, other players exhausting actions you want, and the chronicle filling up and triggering the endgame. But the end can feel a little anticlimactic if you know your scoring position. There are limits on what you can do to reign in a leader, and the game is twice as long as I'd prefer.

After one play: about two rounds in everything clicked and we started hammering through turns. Some interesting, but standard euro strategies until you have to start looking at who to kill off and when. Once that decision starts to appear the game takes off into a 'can I squeeze one more turn out of my politician?' decision that is a bit stressful and yet very fun/funny. The one thing holding me back from saying this is a must have game for me is that our four player game lasted about 1 or 2 rounds longer than I had wished. But then again, those last rounds were really the best rounds. Try the game, it's fun, but it may drag on a bit...just a bit though.

I was pleasantly surprised by Village.  I was fearing it might be "just another worker placement game" but I found the action selection mechanism of removing the cubes and the life span/ death effect made it stand out from the crowd.  In the games I've played I haven't had the sense of one strategy dominating so would have to conclude it's well balanced.  I'm really looking forward to playing this one again.

I like worker placement games so I figured I'd like Village. I had seen a couple of video reviews of the game before I bought/played it so I had a general idea of the gameplay, but the layers and depth of strategy that Village offers surprised me. Simple choices like which generation worker should perform which task or what means you will use to accomplish something (cubes or more time) offers a lot to think about. One of my favorite parts of the game is to look back at what your family has accomplished - were they world travelers, farmers, politicians, craftsmen, etc. Overall, a solid game that I look forward to playing more.

Played once.  A pretty solid eurogame.  I like the way workers die off and are placed into the village's "chronicle", scoring you points -- that provides a good mechanic to theme connection.  I'm not sure the "exploring" or "wandering" mechanic fits in with the rest of the game -- it seemed to be it's own game, which is fine, but a bit at odds with everything else.  I'll have to play again to be sure.

I've heard a lot of talk about how innovative dying workers is. I'm not too impressed with the novelty of this mechanic, but I am impressed with it's integration. Death of workers works really well in the game, and it always seems to do the opposite of what you want it to. Black cubes may be a good or a bad thing. There's a nice balance to it. 

Overall, it's a mid-tier WP game. Its length/weight ratio may be a little off. I personally need a WP game to blow my socks off to keep up with Le Havre, Troyes, Gric, Caylus, etc.

I'm looking forward to get the expansion. The quality is excellent in this game as in all Tasty Minstrel games.

Too much of a victory point salad for my taste. Too much trading back and forth of resources without any engine that really stays. I never felt like my family was improving. I dislike the mechanism of gaining influence when taking actions, though interesting in an abstract way, because it doesn't support the theme all that well. Death is handled strangely, too. You want your people to die, so there's never any real attachment to the little meeples. In Agricola you feel bad when you can't feed your family, here you wouldn't mind starving them to death - as long as they work and have access to a better grave before they bite the dust.

Years ago I would've quickly added Village to my collection and it would get some initial play and then sit there, and I'd wonder why. Now, I see it as a game I'd happily play if it came out at someone's house, but I've no need to own. The mechanism of taking cubes from the board in order to place your workers is clever (cube color is meaningful and limited, and black cubes push your time marker), as is the way your meeples die from the board due to the time mechanism of taking black cubes. You lose, of course, the work ability they were providing, but you hope you can send them to the victory point graveyard (legendary townsfolk) versus the unmarked graves (eh, not so much). At first blush, it's fresh and different -- what's not to like?

The play space feels too limited in how you can go about getting points, and after a few games of trying them all, it seems like I'd get bored. Feels like it needs one other dimension to take off for me. Left me with a feeling of "almost a really good game."

UPDATE: Well, I played with the Inn expansion and think that is the missing dimension for me. The bonus cards offer new ways to go in the game and much more to think about than the base game. Are they too swingy or do they require everyone to get their share such that no one player gets all the great ones? I strongly prefer playing with them to find out.

Jelen pillanatban az egyik kedvencemmé lépett elő az Istanbul mellett! Nem operál olyan áramvonalas szabályokkal, mint az Istanbul de kellően agyégető, amellett kellően könnyed és logikus. Egyesek a hosszát kifogásolják, én ezzel szembe menve, inkább rövidnek találom, mivel az eltervezett stratégiát nem mindig tudom kibontani a kevés kör miatt. Tetszik, hogy mindenhol pontot szerzünk, sokféleképpen indulhatunk el, és bármilyen módon is cselekszünk, végig esélyesek vagyunk a végső győzelemre! Néhány körrel előre kell gondolkoznunk, azaz fel kell építeni nagyjából egy stratégiát, ez igényel némi agymunkát, de lehet érzésből is játszani. Ez tetszik benne. Ha a fokozatosságot betartjuk, azaz nem első játéknak választjuk, akkor családinak is éppen megfelel! Szuper gém!

A lighter non-confrontational euro that contemplates simple village life, the passage of time and one's place in history after death. The game feels rushed, much like life, time passing by, generations passing their elders. The pacing of this game cannot be praised enough. It felt both breezy and weighty, a quality from which many longer games could learn. Another game where the components are top-notch, telling a story as they're placed, and an intimate one to boot.

RATING: 8
To die is not a bad thing in this game, and it's not a bad thing to die "young" as long as you efficiently exploit each man's capacity at the full before he dies. Based on only one game, the game seems very promising. In this game, you can't definitely go for all strategies. You must pick a combination that works with spesific cube colours, unless you use the men in all production buildings (I doubt that it's smart to do so). It's balanced nicely, though almost too well balanced? It's a little confusing to know which strategy to go for. I miss a little accelerating point potential. This only exist for the chronicle. Should at least be for travel, where you invest quite a lot. I love the scoring mechanics in the church! A very nice game that make you want to play several times!

The action selection mechanism (picking cubes that dictate your actions from the center) and deciding how and when to let your people drop dead are both pretty interesting.

The market can be a bit annoying when somebody calls it just before you're ready (but that's good play on their part).  Other parts of the board like "travel" aren't very interesting to me either.

My gut says this one always goes on a bit longer than I'd like, which keeps its rating from being an eight.

Great components, clear rules and a nice novelty in the passing away of your meeples. But there is, imho, a major flaw in that new mechanism: the game actually rewards you for doing nothing.

Especially in a 2p game it could be worthwhile to just collect cubes and don't let any more meeples pass away. And that is the reason why it will not be in my collection.

Shame.

July 2014: No one was prepared to love this game more than me. The theme of village life, and the births and deaths, and legacies of its people, appealed to me; the visuals are great. But as soon as I watched the learn-to-play video, I realized this was one more parallel-play euro cube pusher. Green cubes are spent here and here; orange and pinks are spent there and there; etc.

Upon playing the game, my opinion didn't change: The game is fine but fairly uninteresting. I almost think the only reason this game is getting a 6 from me is because the visual presentation and deaths of my meeple make for a more memorable game than the mechanics would suggest.

Best ideas:
- meeples in the grave

Rather play...
...Lord of Waterdeep for a euro cube pusher
...Castles of Burgundy for a short 2p euro

At least it's better than...
...Dungeon Lords

This game was messier than I expected, with a bunch of different resources, strange ways of taking actions and getting VP, and a kind of incoherence to the design. There's very little blocking, all the slots have many opportunities to be taken, and in fact are guaranteed to be selected at least a particular number of times a round.

The aging mechanic was extremely interesting, but I found the game very tactical and the aging only made it moreso.

Still I'd play it again to see if I can understand the tactical play better.

Da una lastimica cuando se te muere el primer meeple. Pero a partir de ese momento te dejas de sensiblerías. Lo importante es que sean importantes y acaben en el libro y no en una tumba sin nombre anónima que nadie quiere. Un juego muy divertido si además le echas un poquito de teatro. El consumo de tiempo le da un punto complejo que se agradece

Village is a very solid worker placement game that gives a unique vibe with a clever implementation of the concept of dealing with the death of one's workers.  Each turn is pretty quick as the player simply picks an available cube on the board and does the corresponding action based on the location of the cube selected.  One of the cool things is that not only is the location of the cube important, but the color of the cube has meaning too, as it indicates a specific resource, or sometimes, no resource but a sickness that decreases the amount of time left for a worker to live.  However, having a short life isn't always bad - in fact killing off workers can be a part of an effective strategy, and has a direct bearing on the length of the game, and therefore the amount of time one's opponents have to perform the actions they want to do.  On the downside, there is very little player interaction, except in the sense that when I select an action, there's less of a chance that my opponents can select that action - but this is even less apparent than in a game like Agricola, since there are usually multiple chances to take the same action in Village.  It plays a little longer than I was expecting it to as well, and I'm interested to see how different each game plays from one to the next, as there doesn't seem to be as much variability as in some of my favorite games.  But I'm thrilled that I own this game, and can hardly wait to bring it out again!

My son and I enjoy this game immensely.  I love the various ways of scoring and the feel of the game. I actually feel as if I'm part of a long ago village trying to succeed with the simple life. You can definitely tell how short the lifespans were back then. I look forward to many other games of this and trying various paths to victory. Honestly, I will try to win of course, but just playing this is a joy to me.

Edit: After playing with another family that dragged this game out ruined it for me. I really don't have any desire to play it again. It's too bad as I used to really enjoy it.

I love the unique concept. The game is mostly fun. The  strategy is pretty deep and there are multiple paths to victory. The rule book was easy to follow and the design is high quality. 

The game is somewhat fiddly having to restock cubes every turn. It's not intuitive at first just about every action you take has multiple choices or weird quirks.

Once you get the hang of the mechanics the game is pretty clever.

RATING: 7
A curious game. Having your workers die is an inspired idea, ripe with thematic and storytelling opportunity. Unfortunately this is saddled with a rather dry Stefan Feld-esque cube-collecting exercise, and so although the game centered around a rich thematic conceit it ultimately proves a rather abstract experience. For example, whether or not a worker gets "remembered" is nothing to do with their achivements but decided purely by the timing of their death. Similarly, we're told that the cubes we're collecting represent "Faith", "Persuasiveness" etc. but they only ever feel like green and brown cubes. That said the game is very good from a strategic perspective; just don't expect it to feel like anything. I wouldn't turn down a game, but could think of too many other games I'd rather play to hold onto this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very original variation on an otherwise tired theme. I feared this would be just another everybody-manages-his-resources-in-his-corner but this game has a better ratio of player-interaction-to-planning than most. The use of time as a basically unlimited resource is very clever and puts a nice twist on the game. The theme is definitely not novel, but works really well in this one.

Egy elég alap munkáslehelyezős eurogém, egy két csavarral. 
Az egyik az, hogy a munkásaid (családtagjaid) idővel meghalnak, és ez nem is feltétlenül baj, ugyanis az egyik célja a játéknak a családod minél több tagjának beírása a falu krónikájába, amihez szükségszerűen előtte meg kell halni. A másik érdekesség, hogy a munkáslehelyezés helyett, inkább tudáskocka felvevés van. Egy-egy akció végrehajtásához fel kell venni az adott mezőn lévő valamelyik kockát. Ezek a kockák a későbbikben más akciókhoz szükségesek. Így egyrészt limitált, hogy melyik akció hányszor hajtható végre, másrészt egy érdekes kapcsolat alakul ki egy azonnali és egy jövőbeli akció között, ami rengeteg kombinációt ad és így agyalási elehetőséget (lsd. Santiago de Cuba).
A grafika szép, hangulatos.
két dolog nem tetszett annyira:
1. szerintem kicsit túl hosszú
2. a tudáskockák gyűjtögetése nem túl tematikus és lélektelen euróvá alacsonyítja néhol, ezt az amúgy igen hangulatos játékot.

RATING: 6
Village borrows quite a few mechanisms from other games and combines them in new and interesting ways. The most obvious, of course, is the often commented on time track that causes your villagers to die after a while. The novelty here isn't so much that your workers can die because, let's face it, that's really just another way to "promote" them to a state where they will (hopefully) get you victory points, and you've seen that before. No, what's especially nice about it is how it puts control of the end game timing into the players' hands.

Timing is important in multiple ways, for example many of the valuable victory point spots are available in limited quantities only and the actions players can choose each turn are similarly restricted. If there is anything that detracts from the overall positive impression it's the fairly heavy upkeep requirements and that some of the paths in the game, in spite of seemingly diverging quite a bit, feel very similar in the end. This makes the game feel a bit same-y after a few plays.

Interesting take on worker placement. Worker death is not only possible, but sometimes eagerly anticipated. You'll often intentionally grab plague cubes just to kill off your family faster.

This game is good, very good.  It just stays below that point over overwhelming in terms of options, but you certainly feel like there are many degrees of freedom.  I have played it twice and still have only a bare concept of the winning strategy.  On top of that, the twist on worker placement is a brilliant mechanism, and it is very thematic with the death of workers.  Would keep away from newbies, as its intense and at the end, I get that feeling of requiring a smoke (rating 8.932, Dec 2015)

I'm glad I got to try this out before committing to buying it. Village is actually a unique twist on the somewhat tired old worker placement games. Here you remove a cube to take an action, and then get to use that cube later on. It pretty much was standard "buy cubes and resources and convert them into other cubes and resources and then finally VPs" sort of game. However, this one was slightly marred by the fact that nothing really gelled together. They all seemed like parts of a whole that came off mashed up. "Dying" meeples is a great idea, but didn't play into the fun-factor as much as I was hoping. What was left over was a game whose theme I'm really getting tired of and whose gameplay is 80% rehash. Also, without any sort of catch-up mechanic, I pretty much knew 1 1/2 hours into it that I was tying for last place. And there was one more hour to go! In fact, the entire game was an exercise in dealing with very little. I normally like that, but here it was just tiring and grueling. Also, the game requires players to specialize in only a couple of areas. Spreading out too thin is a problem. Thus, I felt I had already explored the game thoroughly half way in and wasn't getting much excitement out of the rest of the game. Oh well, I was glad to finally try it! But I don't think I'll be playing again.

Super fun "life simulation" game. The mechanic of death is very clever, and really forces you to think what you want each family member (meeple) to be, and who should die first and where. Subtle ways of screwing with other people's plans (especially the "grab two cubes" spots) adds to the fun.

Black cubes are a$$holes...sometimes.

I liked the added dimension of having to keep track of which of your people were in each spot. That definitely made a difference in my approach and likely led to my eventual victory. I may borrow this and try it with my wife before buying a copy.

Village is a particular type of Euro.  It is in the same category as "Caylus" - and they do in fact share a mechanism:  Worker Placement.  

Village innovates and expands the worker placement concept in two ways:

1. by allowing multiple activations of a particular spots (buildings) by different players, but capped at "X" number each round (X is dependent on the number of players), 

2.  by allowing you to do (or consume and deny) an action with out actually placing a worker.  Once placed, workers are "sticky" and do not return to you without sacrifice.

Village resembles the "Caylus type" in a more fundamental ways - you turn about 10 resources into other resources and ultimately victory points; the consummate "cube pusher".

One of those resources is "time" and the commitment of one of your workers to the board.  Worker placement and time can buy many things in lieu of one of the other resources.  You almost always have time and workers (either in hand or in place) and can therefore almost always take a useful action.   

In this game, workers die off (in generational order) each time you spend a dozen or so time units.

I'm not a huge fan of these types of games... so it is a "6" at best for me.

Played a few times.
Village to me is a beautiful woman - and you can't deny she's beautiful - who's just not my kind of beauty. So, I did appreciate the idea of moving hourglasses to take note of the time passing by, of meeples put in the graves to score points, of the negative cubes, but at the end of the game it leaves me no emotions at all, just some kind of... incomplete. 
I would never buy it and I'd play it in the mood. Just, it's not my kind of game.

The dying mechanism and the way actions are controlled by picking up resource cubes (that looks like a worker placement mechanic, but really isn't) are very clever and allow for some interesting interactions.

Excellent cube pusher - get resources, convert to VPs - with genuine multiple paths to victory - the mix of available resources actually forces players to pursue alternate paths to some extent.

"I'm a sucker for Worker Placement games but something that I thought really changed the game was the presence of "time" in Village. Actions take time and you keep track of it on your board, when the "year" ends, your oldest workers start dying off... I thought that that was a really interesting and inspiring approach. Gotta keep making babies because the old folks are dying!"

A really enjoyable Euro, and probably my favorite worker placement game of the last year. Well, perhaps a tie with Manhattan Project. Intentionally pushing your relatives down a well to get points seems a little odd, but...
One concern: my daughter focuses just on travel points, and has won the games several times without diversifying.

Numerous paths to victory in a game that benefits from repeated plays.
revision; unfortunately having had a few more plays it now feels like market space is key to victory, especially if one player dominates - have now started playing with this as "advice given to all players" to see if we can balance the game ourselves. 
Feb '15 - Rating scaled down from a 9 to an 8 - just don't seem to get it to the table much and Sam has lost her shine for the game. Recent results haven't been as close either.

I don’t seem to be as enamored with this game as many of my friends. While it does its things pretty good it is still a cubepusher with multiple paths to victory. It seems like the game is much about timing your moves right, but also do what other players are not doing. I can’t point to things in the game that I particularly dislike, but neither can I point on things that excite me. Want to try it again and see if I miss something.

I love everything about this game except for the variable play time. When someone gets out to a quick early lead and rushes the end game by killing off their workers, there are few games that become as unsatisfying as Village becomes. It feels half baked when this happens. It's a shame too, because this would be nearly a top ten game for me if ending the game quickly wasn't a "feature".

RATING: 6.5
One play with three and two plays with four. It's one of those clockwork games where there are seven resources and five commodities and five point-scoring gears, etc. It's well-designed and it kept me engaged throughout, but I found myself wondering if its very convolution undercuts the drama; I need to feel like I know how I'm faring in a game as it's playing out, and without stopping everything to count up points it's all a bit of a maze. Possibly more experience is needed to fully appreciate it? For now I'm rating it a 6.5, but it could go up if I find that it becomes more enjoyable with more play.

RATING: 7.3
Rating after three games (3 + 4 player) which both lasted longer than the box says (60 to 90 mins). As the game is full of tricky decisions, it is also prone to A/P, which my fellow player used to think about a lot what their next move will be. I hope further plays go quicker. 

It's a medium/heavy low interaction Eurogame with a peaceful theme (so no confrontation here). I can't complain on behalf of the mechanics, their all nice interwoven and well playtested, one of them (the aging) is fresh, too. Sometimes there is a little turn angst. But I thought I would enjoy it more, as I like worker placement games.
You get plenty of nice material but have to put on the number stickers yourself onto the meeples. The insert of the gamebox is only one compartment of white cardboard, but at least there are some bags.

RATING: 7.8
Above all, my comment concerns the base game + village inn with 2 players. The first good point is the theme which introduce the very good idea of characters death (don't be afraid to kill your own meeples!). So the design is quite beautiful too (I admit I like medieval theme). An other good point is the variety of actions and collectibles. The Inn expansion adds cards, beer production and simple rules, that's very flowly. But I find "The Village" can be very punitive at the slightest error. An advice : don't rush, especially when you're near the end of the game... Also, at the end of almost each play, I am frustrated, and I'd like to do more actions.

Based on one 2 player game I can only rate this a 5. The game was over before it got started with us scoring something like 20 points each. I guess we played badly. I'm sure I'd have a better experience with more players. August 2014

Interesting generational-like mechanic. That said, I found the game counter-intuitive, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but I'd play Castles of Burgundy anyday compared to this one.

My rating is tentative, after one play, take it or leave it.

A workerplacement with a deadly twist, but it deviates quite a lot from 'standard' workerplacement conventions. I can understand why it won prices. Quite thematic for a workerplacement (or they translated living (and dying) and working in the Middle Ages into a very nice game). Maybe not the best choice with 2, but it is playable and still enjoyable.

This game is probably based on the PC game called Europe 1400 The Guild, or The Guild 2, which is a good idea.

The idea of being in control of a family and it's descendants is quite interesting. I like the mechanics even if it is another worker placement - victory point thingy :( . Also, it has been thoroughly been playtested to a point that whether you play a 2, 3 or 4 players game, the game will be the same. The same in the sense that there will be no adjustments nor any bugs or downside for playing with a different number of players.

Stay away from its expansion though, because it brings nothing new to the base game. You just add another location that brings additional victory points... the only nice thing for certain larger groups of players about the expansion is that it adds a 5th player... but I think 4 players is the best to play this game, play time is reasonable for such a game... adding a 5th player and another place you can visit only adds more time to each turn.

I think there's been a backlash against Village, saying it isn't as deep as it should be. I very much appreciate Village, I think it approaches the mechanics of basic resource collection and worker placement in a new way. The game itself can feel a bit like yak-shaving (do this to do that to do this for random points?), but it's unique enough that I appreciate it.

I don't think I ever played a more thematic heavy euro, and guess what, it made me question myself if I would die from the plague as I played it.
Jokes aside, it is a somewhat drab game (both in theme as in gameplay), so hardly my first recomendation in the theme (probably slightly less overwhelming than some recomendations I might actually make).
Solid (but not very fun) euro.
I would prefer playing it with 3-4 players.

RATING: 9
Very good game centered on a sort of reverse worker placement: although some actions do require a worker, you actually take a cube off the board in order to perform an action, and that is what reduces the availability of future actions in the round. Another interesting mechanic is spending time for those actions, which may cause your workers to die and eventually determines the game end. There are multiple strategies, many things to consider, and all seems pretty well balanced. The theme also works quite well.

A decent game with some things I don't like.

Overall theme is ok, and concept of workers staying on occupations and eventually dying is good.

Some of the core mechanisms feel bit gimmicky: dying early in different occupation categories to get to town book, getting randomly seeded resource cubes for taking actions etc. Nothing horribly off (ie. they work on mechanical level), but all-and-all this game feels bit unconnected and messy.

Also, I don't usually do very well in this game.

Quite a challenge to know what to invest in next. There is a lot going on every round and it can be a bit confusing keeping all the possible actions straight. This game also has a lot of components. However, I find it to be quite fun to see what set of events will lead to a successful end. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like that there seem to multiple paths to victory, even if I don't quite get when to pick which path.  I like that unlike in many other worker placement games, there is a way to take an "unavailable" action -- use three identical cubes.

There are a lot of important decisions to make at times.  Sometimes it's a simple as looking at what other players are likely to do (especially the player to your left), and beating them to it by taking the cube or action that they want.  A good example is the market cube, which can lead to good points at no cost in time -- if you're the one to take the market action.  If you have collected goods for acquiring the same tile as another player, you want to make sure that you go first in the market day before them.

Travelling seems to be a really good deal.  The spots closest to the entrance are worth 3 points each, plus their points at the end (at least 1 point, up to 4 points).  That can make travelling one extra spot at the end worth 7 points!  Also, some spots give you cubes, which can help you get to the next spot.

The council chamber is also pretty good, especially the 6-point spot at the end, which can turn a gold into +3 VP.  It's important to remember that you only need to pay a scroll tile or 2 green cubes (and time) if you want to advance in the council; you can stay in the same spot and take that action (or a lower one) for no cost.  So I can see how wheat to gold to +3 VPs could be a good VP strategy.

It's important to remember that you get end-of-game points for *each* person that you have in the council chamber and church.  So there is a reason to put more than one person in those sections.

I'm not sure I like the game, overall... A problem is that it's a timing game.  You could be gearing up with cubes and wagon tiles for the next few actions, and then the game could suddenly end by the unmarked graves being filled up, giving you only one last action.  So you have to guess who might end the game (who's in a position and motivated to kill a person that fills up the last grave) and play based on what you guess their schedule to be.  That can lead to a lot of "if I'd only known it was going to end, I would have played differently!" comments after the game is over, which doesn't feel fun.

Fun theme that is done very well.  A medium weight strategy game that I wish was a little heavier...I think.
 
Four problems : 1)You have no push at the beginning to take a certain strategy.  You have to start building a strategy on nothing. This is why a game like Agricola has cards that you get at the start of the game. 2) It usually doesn't seem like a bad thing to take plague cubes. 3)Suffers from the same thing as Lords of Waterdeep.  It doesn't understand "worker placement". Any player can pretty much take any action at any time or they may have to just wait a little longer to to take their desired action. No blocking. 4) To continue with that point a little - there is no line of strategy that really makes sense.  I feel like you can almost just take random actions and do fine.  Too much to do with no direction to the actions. 5)  The theme.  I love the theme and how it is implemented except:  when you put workers on a craft space they make a product for you.  Why for you?  wouldn't they be making it for others and you would get an income?  Whatever.

What I do really like about this game is how much attention you have to pay  to the pace of the game set by other players.  This is a great thing about this game and I'm am usually excited to play it because of this.

Yet another Euro resource conversion game. However, this game still distinguishes itself through a few novel ideas.

The presentation of the village as the location of action selection is aesthetically pleasing though.

For me probably the best Euro-game I've played so far. Medieval theme is great, there's a lot of things to do and a lot of ways to win, but only so little time. Meeple death mechanic is something great, that you have generations within your family and when time passes, the older folks are dying. That's a mechanic that truly forces you to optimize your turns and creates a feeling of urgency into the game. This game is shamefully understated. Expanions add a lot into this one, so please do get them too.

RATING: 7.5
Village proves to be an interesting worker placement game which takes the time/hourglass tracking in a different direction- instead of changing turn order it measures the actual lifetimes of the meeples (sad meeples- sob!)

But though the meeples that have passed away are no longer usable for actions, they occupy spaces which (a) give victory points and (b) serve as the game timer.

In a 1st solo 4-player learning game, I found getting to the end game conditions a bit tedious (I was holding on to earlier generations too long), but with additional experience one remembers to "Race for the Graveyard," and then the endgame flows naturally.

I initially feared the idea of deceased meeples might come across oddly, but it was really not terribly different from games like Key Market, where workers are 'retired' for VP's before the end of the game.

There certainly are a number of options in play, and I can see it potentially causing a litle AP in learning games, but overall I think this game flows well and would not cause too much thought for expeienced gamers.

I am starting this at a 7, with real climbing potential if I find (as I expect to) that it flows to a satisfying conclusion much better with plays under one's belt. 

Updates: Bumped up to a 7.25 after 2nd game (3-player solo); after fixing the cube distribution rule and the timing for interment of meeples I found this played in the expected time period, and I liked the flow much better. 

Bumped up to a 7.5 after 3rd game (2-player solo).  I was really pleasantly surprised how well the simple 2-player adjustments retained the taut feeling of the available actions, and kept the game-length down. This is a solid game at all player counts so far, and was well-worth the impulsive pick-up.  Now to see if the family like it!

(05/09/2014) Comment based on 1 play.

This is an interesting action-drafting, pseudo-worker placement game, that follows the lives of multiple generations in some country village. Each player has a number of family members that can be categorized into four generations.

On the board there are a number of action spaces, which are tied to specific buildings or events. At the beginning of each turn, a seemingly random assortment of cubes are placed on each location. A player will draft an action associated with the building or event, by selecting a cube from the corresponding spot. Once cubes are gone from that spot, the action can no longer be drafted. Some spots have more cubes than others. Thus, players must balance near-term objectives versus long-term ones based on the actions and the specific color of the cube they are pulling.

This is because most of the action spaces require expenditure of specific combinations of colored cubes that were collected beforehand, in order to make progress in a particular building or event.

The action spaces are:
1) Cart --> collect food.
2) Travel --> expend specific colored cube combinations a wagon, and time, to simulate the travel experiences of one of your family members.
3) Market --> expend hardware, scrolls, food, or some combination, in order to garner VP.
4) Crafthouses --> expend either specific colored cube combinations or time to get hardware, scrolls, or money.
5) Church --> expend a cube or time, and enroll one of your family members to become a friar in the church.
6) Church --> Get married and have a child, which brings out a worker from the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th generations.
7) Council House --> expend reputation cubes and time, in order to gain political power (and first turn).

As noted, some of these actions require "time", which is kept track.

Initial rating: "7".

(01/01/2015) Update after 2nd play.

I understand and am more comfortable with the action-drafting/cube-pulling mechanism, as well as the time progression mechanism this time around than the first. Although I enjoyed myself more and eventually won the game, this game left me feeling flat. As the time progresses around on each player's tableau, family members die off and are laid to rest in the "Chronicles", where more members means more bonus points. The game flows quickly if players know what they are doing, pulling cubes and drafting actions, but it is really not that all exciting. In terms of theme, there really is no rhyme or reason for the seeding and pulling of specific colored cubes in any of the action spaces, and this part feels disconnected and abstract to me (much like the mancala mechanism in Trajan, but for some reason I don't mind it in that game). The only tension is wondering if a critical action that is important to you is still there, it is a matter of prioritizing the action-drafting, as well as "timing" the aging of your family members so they are laid to rest quickly to occupy a space in the Chronicle. It is still a lukewarm, meh "7". Good game with interesting mechanics, but not all too exciting.

Tanto el sistema de juego como los materiales son muy buenos... El hecho de incorporar la acción de "la muerte de los meeples" le da más "vida" al juego pues tienes que pensar muy bien cuándo y dónde ponerles... Sin embargo, el tener tantas acciones creo que confunde demasiado... Aún así es un buen juego...

I played this at the spring Dollar Con 2014 with 1 experienced player and 2 other new players. The game ended with everyone within 3 points of each other (I was tied for first with the experienced player). Exciting? No; two of us were just glad the pain was finally over. 

While it's possible the game gets more interesting after a few plays, our first play was long (120 minutes) and incredibly dull.

Lots of possible choices but I would contend that it is just an illusion and that only a couple of choices make sense once you pick a strategy.

A semi-worker placement game where the main driver is actually taking a cube from an action and hence reducing its future availability.  Workers are also placed on some actions to make them easier to take a second time.  More importantly death plays a part.  Scheduling the death of your family members is key to the game. The base game seems to have 2 key strategy - the easier of them being travelling.

RATING: 8
Some interesting thematic touches set this apart from other euros. Getting used to the idea that often purposefully killing your workers is the best thing to do can take a few plays, and while the mechanics are strong the theme seems thinner and thinner with each play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The best Euros are based around a great theme and that applies here big time. The rose-tinted image of living, marrying and dying in a small community is very well captured and sets up a great gameplay experience. This is really a worker placer with a twist, instead of sending workers to capture spaces, you take a resource cube from a space until all have been taken. Very much a game that works best at small scale (2-3 Players), there's more chaos with 4 and I'm rather glad the designers didn't allow for 5 which they easily could have. It's very much an exercise in action efficiency and with tight scoring, random elements like who is drawn from the church bag can effect end of game placements. Above average for a recent Euro.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a cute euro.  The death thing, is, ah, original, and I quite enjoy the tension of manipulating things to get in the book before the other players. Prior to death, there are a lot of different paths to pursue. I'd love to believe that it's possible to win without focusing on the market, but so far I haven't seen evidence of that. (2 plays)

Classico gestionale tedesco, che introduce l'interessante meccanica della morte dei "lavoratori", come elemento sia di positività che di negatività.

This is a very enjoyable worker placement (much more than most WP that I've tried).  Building up your strategy for gathering points seems to be a four pronged plan dealing with markets, traveling, filling the chronicle, and throwing all your other family members into the church.

I don't know if I want to get the expansion (it is highly recommended and expands to 5 players).  The pub's individual cards may unbalance the scoring of the game significantly with one off and final score manipulation of rules.  I'd definitely like to try the expansion, but at $36 it's an outrageous over charging for what you are getting that I would never pay.

So underappreciated here at BGG. My wife an me love it and everybody else we played it with also did. The machanisms are a nice twist in the worker placement genre. 
It is more accessible that Agricola to teach to others. It is less tense and doesnt feel as frustrating so we pick it more often. It is also less competitive in the way that you do not completety deminish the strategy of others with your action taking.

Village is a limited action allowance game by worker placement mechanic. The game describes a daily life and livelihood of generations in the medieval times. Most of all, the game has successuflly expressed people's routine works in the middle ages. Unlike other worker placement games, in Village, workers are vanished with the passage of time. Because of the time variable, players have to consider the arrangement of workers. With these new mechanical challenges, players are faced with more tactical considerations. Village provieds lots of tactical choices to players. Moreover, Village gives a good lesson for the game participants about the transient life.

I dislike many games that Village kind of reminds me of, but for whatever reason I find that Village just has a certain charm.

I was disappointed by the Village Inn expansion.

Of all the games I've played of the "Euro" persuasion, this one is my favorite. Unlike a lot of the prototypical Eurogames, I feel the theme in Village really fits the mechanics and breathes additional life and narrative into the game. In addition to that, the game itself is very, very solid. I love the various routes to victory, and how all of the resources in the game interact with one another on some level. It makes for a very organic and satisfying experience in trying to optimize one's available resources and options. 

I also really love the subtle black humor of the game. The game is essentially about having your family toil away their existence in their chosen field, working themselves to death in the eponymous medieval village. The ultimate catch being the only ones that really matter are those that are remembered for their work by the rest of the village. Maybe I read too much into it, but I love the sort of cynical reflection the game presents about our own culture and the ways we attribute meaning to our lives, while at the same time being so darned charming and pleasant about it. At first I thought the cutesy art style clashed with the rather morbid theme and mechanics, but now I've grown to think it's perfect. It sort of gives me a Monty Python vibe.

One of my top games. I love it!

Bokkensprong 21/06/13 met grootva, Joris, Tine en dochter Lien (laatste twee speelden samen). Mannetjes plaatsen en acties kiezen. Doel: meeste prestigepunten behalen. Actieplaatsen: ambachten (paard, os, kar, ploeg, perkament of graan voor geld), graan oogsten (boer nodig), familie (nieuwe telg erbij, of man terug naar boerderij sturen), kerk ("in de zwarte zak"), dorpshuis (startspeler, voordelen...), reizen (wagen en tijd nodig), markt (punten verdienen door geschikte waren te verkopen aan klanten). Acties kosten tijd en/of gekleurde blokjes. Wanneer de zandloper volledig rond is, sterft een van de oudste familieleden. Sterven is geen probleem, maar liefst wel op de juiste plaats, zodat het familielid in de kronieken terechtkomt (ipv in een anoniem graf). Veel spelmogelijkheden; eerder strategisch; komt in begin wat zwaar over maar valt eigenlijk goed mee.

I don't know what it was about this game; it was nice, but really nothing special. I thought the whole dying thing would be cool, but it didn't actually seem to change things up too much.

While Village caught many a gamer's attention with the pitch that their families members can die to score points, that's not really what this game is all about. It's really more a typical Euro where points are scored in many ways combined with almost the opposite of worker placement (players remove tokens rather than placing them to take actions). The use of time and death is novel, but this is a pretty standard Euro game. I enjoy those, so I've kept this game in my collection. Others may not be so kind.

For those who do like this game: get the Village Inn expansion. It improves the already solid base game.

I've only played once, but I'm impressed so far. I like the time/"death of a family member" mechanic especially. Your "time" often seems like something you need to use wisely, but at other times you want to waste it and kill off family members for those sweet, sweet VPs.

This is also probably the most thematically interesting "medieval town" game I've played. The permanent placement of workers makes each one seem unique and special. I still feel sorry for Novice Gerald, one of my first generation family members, who spent almost the entire game trying to get promoted in the church, but kept getting passed over for more worthy recruits, and those whose families could offer a bribe. He finally got his first promotion, but died off soon thereafter.

It won Kennerspiel des Jahres, so you've probably read up on it.  It's a resource management game with an interesting role selection mechanism.  Your meeples span several generations and many of them will die.  You're looking for as many of them as possible to die well.  One would think it's too long and heavy for me, but I enjoyed it.  And I won, which doesn't hurt.  It seems like the kind of game I'll be terrible at once I understand what's going on, so we'll see.

The game continues to grow on me. Having now seen people pursuing widely different strategies in order to score points, all those strategies seem viable: The church, the town hall, and the market are all obvious candidates for many end-of-game points. Travel might be too, but it seems awfully expensive, and you need to commit to it wholeheartedly in order to score big points.

Getting your workers into the chronicle is important too, but (for us at least) it hasn't been a mindless rush to get them there: While true that one shouldn't necessarily see the death of a meeple as a bad thing, it really depends on timing, and just mindlessly killing everyone off as soon as possible seems like a bad strategy.

So far, at least, Village continues to impress.

------
A positive surprise: While the game doesn't seem particularly well-polished (or necessarily balanced, I don't know), it's a very thematic euro and for a worker-placement game, it seems very *different* somehow (and not just the 'death' mechanism). A breath of fresh air in a somewhat stagnant sub-genre...

Initial Rating: 7.0 (September 2012)

I was pleasantly surprised by Village. I guess I DO like eurogames :D. Village doesn’t really bring anything really new to the table (except for the dying meeples, that´s a first for me) but what it brings it does well. It is a lot more meaty than I initially thought, a big plus for me. The game has a lot of luck (The mass and the seeding of the cubes each round) but it can be managed, so it really doesn’t bothers me. The player who best plan his strategy will be likely the player who wins, that is, I feel the luck, although high, doesn’t impact negatively the game.  
 
I particularly like the meeples dying mechanic, you have to plan very well how quickly and from where you will “kill” your family members :devil: and the fact that you have to kill them in generation order adds another layer of strategy to the game. Sometimes you need to kill them fast and other times you need them to live a little longer. I love that.

The game turns flow easily, I didn’t feel any downtime with this game.

The components are very well done and the art is adequate although a little dull for my taste. I don’t like the theme (as with most Euros) but the gameplay is so good I can ignore that. The game board serves well its purpose, it is easy to understand and explain the game to new players as everything is so clearly depicted. 

Bottom line it is a solid game. I definitively want to play again, for now this is in my “like to have” list of games but I think it can get an upgraded rating.

Solidly designed worker placement game. The death mechanic is a new and creative idea. The cube placement mechanic is also quite smart, it adds a level of randomness to the action spot seeding, and also acts as a currency to fuel other actions. Adding in the Inn and Port expansions just improve the game, add more choices and improve some of the less used mechanics of the base game (i.e. travel). While the game is quite thematic, the theme itself is a bit dry (i.e. farm family living near a village). However the expansions really spice up the theme and bring this already solid game up to a 9. Adding the pub patrons and the sailing mechanic adds nicely to the theme and makes the game less dry and more adventurous.

I bought this and tried it the same evening...honestly I was a bit disappointed.  Perhaps I over hyped it in my head but the whole dying mechanic and placing your workers in the graveyard was unique but didn't wow me like I had expected.  My game also ran long (close to three hours if memory serves).  For this type of game it was just way to long.  It's not a terrible game and I'd certainly play it again but I'd just assume play Castle of Burgundy, Key Flower, or Tzolkien over this title.

I really thought I was going to like this game. I watched Rahdo's run through of it, Shut Up & Sit Down's review. It looked awesome. My wife and I played it today and were seriously underwhelmed. Richard Ham has a great imagination, and with him playing the game and telling the story, the theme seemed really strong. I won't say my wife and I lack imagination, but I will say that to recreate the kind of storytelling gameplay that he experienced would take an effort that my wife and I aren't always up for. So, without the theme, we we're left with the mechanics and the decisions. They aren't bad at all, they just weren't particularly interesting to us. We're going to give it another try, so maybe my opinion will change, but our first impression was not a good one.

Nice little worker placement game where over time your oldest workers will die off, forcing you to choose which worker to bury. I didn't see anything new in this game and it did play at a good pace. Ultimately, there are worker placement games out that I enjoy more so I don't expect to be playing this much.

June 1 Update:  Upgraded to a 9 after about two dozen plays.  This has been the most played game in my collection for 2012, just about everyone I have shown it to has enjoyed it, many have come back for repeated plays.  No two games have played exactly the same, and there appear to be multiple paths to victory.  Play balance has held up, so this is my candidate for Game of the Year -- note it is a finalist for the KdJ (Kennerspiel) award.

Tentative rating based after five plays.  Have played a number of the Essen 2011 releases and, right now, this would have to be my candidate for the best of the bunch.  Rules are fairly straightforward, there are multiple paths to victory, and the rather unique element where certain workers that are placed "die" during the course of the game adds an element that I have not seen in other games.  Hopefully, the game will not get stale with multiple plays but, as of this writing (Feb. 2012), it's my favorite of the fall 2011 releases.

RATING: 8.25
An excellent take on the worker placement genre, with multiple paths towards scoring points and victory.  You really need to pay attention and adjust your strategy based on the strategy of others, which I love.  

I look forward to many more plays of this title in the future.

This game's awesome! Do I really need to say more? It just has a lot of different dynamics and a lot of different ways to win. I love the "time" being a resource aspect. Each person playing does his own thing and the one who does it the best, wins.

Solid game, nicely done.  A bit busy in rules and artwork.  No real complaints here - just does not quite capture the imagination, despite the novel ideas, and its a bit long.

RATING: 5
This is alright. Picking up cubes, timing your workers' deaths is interesting. Concerned about the depth of the game though... there are certainly multiple strategies but overall every game should play out the same way, with everybody doing one section of the board. The only difference is who will be doing what each game.

I also dislike the cathedral pulling, adds luck to the game.

Maybe some random setup element is needed.

One of the best (if not the best) Eurogames I've ever played.
Great theme and feel of the game, with a great deal of strategy.

This is a worker placement game with a twist, eventually your workers (or "family members" as they are called in the rules) will die, which at first made me little sad when I lost some of my workers early in the game. But late in the game (a bit too late in fact) I realized that it can be desireable to have your workers die off early in the game to get them into the village chronicle before the other players (a bit morbid I know, but there is lots of easy points to be obtained that way).

Village is a worker placement / action selection game that convinces by solid gameplay coupled with the extraordinary setting of everyday life in a medieval city, i.e. you are not building a cathedral but instead your folks are working, praying and dying. Especially the time mechanism for dying is unique enough to justify yet another worker placement game. Beside that, there are various ways to victory, the game end can be timed by the deaths of workers and there are many small races to be ahead one step of others to make Village stand out from the masses. Rating might increase with more plays.

27 July 13 Really enjoying this one with our gaming group. It's a shame that no-one wants to use the explorer part of the board (top right hand) as it's too expensive and doesn't give enough bonuses. We're going to house rule that you don't hand in your wagon when travelling. That might make it more attractive.
That aside we all really enjoy the market, church and rest of the board. Fun.
Update 18 Jan 14 - played using the house rule of not turning in your wagon when you travel in the travelling section. Worked much better and made more sense. Didn't unbalance the game in any way. More players gave it a go and did reasonably well. Will play with this house rule in future.

Really like the mix of mechanics in this game.  The random placement of the cubes yields the fascinating interaction between balancing resource acquisition with the actions you want to complete.  The 'death' mechanic and timing of the later generations in particular places is also a stimulating challenge.

This game has one really cool mechanism, the one where time goes by and you get to kill off one of your own meeples.

The rest of the game is just another boring euro.

So this is the game that will make you fall asleep...

I was really against the exclusive deal that TMG had with this game and so I ended up being really late to the party. The Brands seem highly inconsistent to say the least, but this game is mechanically sound. Sure, it's a cube-pusher point conversion game, but it works. The down side is the horribly bland theme which doesn't really bother me that much except for the fact that it seems like they didn't even make an effort. It's not Strasbourg or Norenberc or Firenze. It's "Village". Not only is the theme completely interchangeable with a ton of other eurogames, but they didn't even try to situate it in any type of place except a generic village.

A clever game of Euro-cube collecting and converting to VP. There's a special mechanic of aging your workers so that they die, and you need to bring in newer ones.

The problems I have with the game are VP related. There are no clear VP paths, and there are too few ways to get VPs. You just seem forced to play a certain way every time. Also, the layout of the board is horrendous. Words printed and skewed in every which direction. Makes for poor reading.

RATING: N/A
A good and solid game, and still feels fresh although you get the usual mix of euro elements. But there are two nice twists that take the game a little about an average euro: members of your family will slowly but surely die, and you get a coloured cube when you take an action. Many options, and many decisions to make. You cannot do everything, so choose a path and try to follow that road. 
Complaints: I did not like when my member had to die at the council, and I had to start from scratch again. It did not make sense, and felt a waste of time and resources. '
The game end is frustrating, as you do not really get to do a lot of things, just wait till you or someone else triggers the end. Game explanation took almost an hour, but once we started, the game flow smoothly and at a very good pace.
BGG rating: this game is not 3.1, it should be way below 3.

RATING: 7
A large amount of options on each turn, and players always have an "out" if their preferred action is taken, so it doesn't initially seem as cutthroat as some other Euros, but the death mechanism can afford players a surprisingly large amount of control over the game speed.

The seeding and mass mechanisms are interesting additions, too.

RATING: 7.25
Interesting game. I do think that too much is made of the 'death' feature of this game. I like the variety in the game. I like the multiple paths to victory. I especially like the mechanic of removing a cube to signify your move, rather than placing one.

I think this board is poorly laid out and could have been done much better. Although I enjoyed the game, I came away feeling that I really hadn't achieved much. It was -- dare I say it -- a bit boring.

I suppose it's a bit of a mixed bag: a very good game which is somewhat boring.

RATING: 6
Another worker placement game with the unique aspect of time and workers dying.  It kept things interesting but ultimately I didn't feel like my choices were that difficult.  I prefer games with heavier theme as well.  It was an average game but there are so many other games I prefer.  
A MAJOR complaint with the game after 3 plays is the seemingly single path to victory.  There is little to no benefit of spending time and resources to travel or go to the guilds much or really in killing off your meeples to the book.  The game is won and lost in the city hall, church, and market.  The same strategy has won all 3 games I have played so far with the player(s) going for travel finishing a DISTANT 3rd and 4th. 
There is also minimal variability in gameplay from game to game.  The only inherent difference is they way the cubes, meeples, and market buyers are pulled from the bag.  That's it.  The game feels the same every time.  Too much randomness is bad but so is near complete lack of randomness.

My daughter is fascinated by the dying meeples :-)


Edit: one play through. Was harder to teach than I expected. Kid claims she enjoys it. It's pretty quick to play and should be snappier now that we know what's going on.


Edit: Really enjoyed the second play through. Much faster and seamless. It's a lighter game that is smart and easy to play once you understand it.

Good but limited game. I find the economy more tight than fun. There are four or five resources you can produce and you spend the game trying to produce as many of them as you can. You hustle through workers to try to score points via good timing on top of the action options. It's tough to math out, a plus, but the path to victory is be lucky and opportune. 

Games like this are why I love Agricola, which requires both a strategy and tactics. This is only the latter and not much of the former. Too much changes in a 4p from round to round to make planning worthwhile. You take what the other players give you and it may or may not synch with your plans. 

It's well designed but not that much fun for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice unique mechanisms, the only thing that bothers me is the lack of realism.
One can simply kill of his people and have 4th generation people and the other player can still be with his 1st generation while playing quite efficiently.
The game seems to reward wasteful actions rather than efficient ones.
That said the game is great overall and the "Inn" and "Port" expansions add up quite well.

Rating after 1 play.
Lots of things to pursue.  Gives the impression that one can do well by focssing on a single aspect or two but also that diversity brings rewards as well.  Clever take on worker placment is that it really seems more like "action selection" with workers being placed an an effect more than the action itself.  It felt fresh to me for this subtle difference in a world where worker placement is now every other game to hit the table.
Looking forward to another play.

Wow, what a nice and deep game. The different actions are really tied together and you really need to thinks a couple of steps ahead.

I had my first play of this game last night and I was very impressed. Unlike some Euro-Games this one did not feel like a math problem that I had to figure out in order to win or come close to winning. I tend to be more of a fly by the seat of my pants players and had a very good time playing this game and game in second by 3 points. I want to play this again and even though it is a bit more complex than what I would consider a typical gateway game, I think the theme is good enough I could gateway some players into it.

I am not yet sure this is a "worker placement" game as there are a couple of different mechanics that sets it apart, which also takes some getting used to, but after one or two rounds the game really flows and is very thematic. The aging mechanic works great and the artwork is beautifull. The game also feels more tactical than strategic which I enjoy.

Disjointed game play, multiple thematic disconnects detract from pleasant, bucolic setting of the village. Innovative system (worker placement where workers die) rewards strange strategies (intentionally aging people to death to put them in the chronicle).

In general, seems like too much work to get things done. Otherwise fine game, I just don't like the way that some things don't align with the theme.

05-05-2014 - After one play... I'm not sure yet.  Well, I know I like it, I'm just not sure how much.  This is a pretty typical cube pusher - you need cubes, they're hard to get, it's hard to do everything you want to do, etc.  But the killing, er, "retiring" of family members really does make this game very, well... pretty different.  It adds a whole new kind of planning requirement to the typical worker placement game.  Tough decisions at times.  The game definitely does not "play itself" either, you are in control and have to make something out of nothing from the get-go.  7.5 for now, I could see it getting as high as 8.5, but that's probably the ceiling without an expansion to make it more interesting (and this game seems like it would be pretty easy to expand).

This is an odd bird. 

I like it, but man it is going to suck teaching it to others. 

It feels like there is something missing from the game. 

With death, time is just another resource.  You just need to make sure the placements you make for points, end up staying there as points. 

Shut up Grandpa, or we'll make you build wagons.

Quite a braintwister. Comfortable euro-game, lots of cubes, many resources, different production chains, selling things, trying to get profit etc. I liked the time idea of the game, where your workers die if you use too much actions which require time as one of the "construction materials". I'm definitely looking for more plays.

Elegant worker-placement game. I like the time as a resource aspect. The gameboard is fun to look but it can still be quite a brain burner. Replay value is not the greatest in my opinion (doesn't make you instantly want to play it again) but the expansions add quite a lot in that regard. Also, the game is relatively cheap, only about 20 euros when on sale.

The only complaints from other players has been the

Death mechanic... which is cool, but it does not get good reviews. 

Village is a game full of tactical challenges. A smart and unique new action mechanism is responsible for keeping turns short and yet still tactically rich and full of difficult decisions. Also unique is the way this game deals with the delicate subject of death; as a natural and perpetual part of life in the village, thoughts of death will keep you focused on smart time-management.

When I think of EURO I think auf Village. I don't know why but I love the ideas and little stories you can build around your little medieval farmer family. When they send off there son to become a wagon-maker or grandpa is into politics or uncle jeff is taking to the road, everyone goes to the church on sundays or you sell your cow on the market once a week. After a rich life when you helped your family you die at the end and get a place in the cronicles. I feel hooked to this game. And also to its expansions. It's story time!

This is an extremely convoluted game that I consider to be unplayable.

The new idea that this game introduce is the fact that people age and that previous generations can leave a trace in history. It they would have focused on that idea only they could have made a great game. I would even added the ability for ancestors to give power ups to newer generations like if some ancestral power were transferred from a generation. But unfortunately, village does no have such cool feature.

Village is not only a worker placement game, it's a double worker placement game. You take actions by picking up cubes and sometimes it requires a worker. So you must plan cube pickup and worker placement.

It also the kind of games where there are many options possible that almost does the same thing, so you could get what you want in one way or another. But the problem is that the resource flow is so complex, if there is one, that if you try to draw a graph of it, you are going to end up with a spider web.

It's also the kind of game where what ever you do, every player is going to end with approximately with the same number of VP. So all path lead to victory and there is not really a way to get ahead or behind.

The worst part is that some actions, power ups or other things are absolutely unbalanced. Some actions have very expensive cost for no good reason (for example the merchant). 

You also have these buildings where you could upgrade your character by making them raise rank. It's a cool idea, but there is no reason to raise older generation in ranks because they are going to die for sure, and there is no reward for dying in a higher rank, you only score at the end of the turn. So you just better leave it rank 1, make sure it dies to send it as fast as you can in the chronicle.So this is another reason I think that the game is seriously broken. 

Finally, something much illogical with the theme, families age differently according to what they do. When has it happened in history that some people ages slower than other. Please tell me, I want to know if I could save some years. Instead of placing a time cost on some actions, they should have made all people age at the same time and give a unique number of each pawn.

There was a game of 1856 running while we played, and I thought that this game was actually easier to play than village. At least, you know where the money comes from and where it get spent.

RATING: 7
Definitely an interesting worker placement type of game where you must balance death of your meeples with maximizing output and VPs.  Different strategies for victory seem to be present.  If you can pursue the strategy less chosen by others, you will likely win.  This is a solid, middleweight game.

So I hate Worker Placement games, always have, and most likely always will. WP games are the reason I started turning away from Euro games in general, which I guess I should be thanking the WP lot for in some strange way. That boring strange little man on the cover of Caylus, he can go right off and fuck himself for all I care.

That being said, Village is probably the best WP game I have played to date (and yes i have played more than just Caylus). While listening to the explanation of the rules I couldn't but think that it would be the same thing every other worker placement game was, and would bore the shit out of me for 3 hours. Well I was in for a shock, it was only 90 min, big plus in my book. The mechanics are definitely not very thematic, but being thematic is not a requisite for being a WP game. Village also turns the usually somewhat competitive aspect of WP games, really into something a little bit more cuthrroat. 

The generations mechanic is definitely the backbone of the game, and makes for very interesting choices throughout the game. This was definitely a good choice for the structure of this game as it is clearly the most interesting of all of the mechanics in the game. 

The theme is really quite terrible, and the graphic design is abhorant, but overall if I had to play a WP game this would be it at this point. 

Hey Caylus dude, I thought I told you go to fuck yourself?

I absolutely love this game! I love how it is a mix of worker placement, resource collection, and pick-up-and-deliver. It is so unique that your workers die and you have to try and get them in the book of remembrance before your opponents. I think all strategies in this game are equally balanced and allows players to pursue different paths to victory! The end scoring is usually very close which often makes people want to play again :)

This SdJ winner offers a couple of novel ideas. First, it's not quite worker placement, though it looks like it if you squint. Second, the workers that you sort of place but sort of don't eventually die off, which makes for some tough decisions.

That said, it reminds me of a Stefan Feld game (specifically Trajan) in which there's a big mishmash of things you're already kind of tired of linked by a single innovative mechanism. It's not terrible, but it's also nothing particularly special. I can't imagine people will still be thinking much about it in a few months.

If Village is what everybody else wants to play, I'll play.  Certainly playing Village is better than not playing a game at all.  However, I find that there is an unspoken complexity:fun ratio in each game that needs to be equal (or heavier on the fun side) in order for the game to work.  Village take a while to set up.  It takes a long time to explain.  There are tons of components.  And all of those things just don't quite add up to fun for me. If I'm going to be sending folks out to work and collecting points in several categories, I'd much rather be playing Trajan.

The first game I've encountered where a plausible part of your strategy could be to 'die first and often', taking valuable space in the graveyard of choice.  Multi-strategy worker placement (right up my alley) with some unusual options.  Not all facets of the game hit on the mark, but for the most part: it's enjoyable, forces you to use more strategy than many games, gives you options on how to collect VP, and keeps you entertained.  There are several PVP incidents as well as some press-your-luck qualities in the game.  A solid introduction into level 2 of Euro-games.

After first play, I liked this game.  Very streamlined Euro with the interesting 'workers die' mechanic.  However,  death is not such a bad thing in this game as it is one option to get points and can speed up the end of the game.   I actually liked having the option to extend or shorten the length of the game.

A very solid game.

Bad choice of cube colors and uneven painting on the cubes makes it hard for me to distinguish the green and brown cubes. Will need to mark up the green cubes.

While I cannot think of any specific examples at the time I write this, Village is one of a newer breed of games that offers a fair variety of scoring possibilities, with a fair number of routes to obtain each, the trick is that all of them are equal opportunity. What's more is that because all things are fairly equal and it's by the narrow margin of points here or there that you will win.

You have to keep track of the big picture, not only that but the fact that you have to time the use of your workers as they age out in order, this latter bit being the most interesting and tension inducing. I quite enjoyed what this package had to offer. It does fill a niche in my collection, which means that it will see more play and stick around for some time to come.

I keep comparing [thing=104006][/thing] to [thing=102680][/thing] because the both are point salad style games; [thing=104006][/thing] is a bit more interactive as there are only so many actions of each type up for grabs.  Along with the decision over which action to take, there's the added decision of which colour cube to take with it.  As the cube colours influence what you can do with your actions, you may find that you're competing for the pinks or the greens with another player.  In [thing=102680][/thing], your action is selected through your movement of cylinders around your own mancala.  It's done in isolation - although your action may result in you picking up a counter or a card that your opponent may have wanted.  But given the options available in [thing=102680][/thing], your taking what someone else wanted is rarely a ball-crushing move.  In [thing=104006][/thing], late in a round, it can be.  There are times when the only cubes left are black (plague) and the action they are linked to gives you no benefit at all.

Ender says:
So, is Village a game for you? If you approach Village with too high expectations as an award winning, innovative, and richly thematic game, you do run the risk of being disappointed, and even judging the game unfairly. But if you approach Village as a quintessential cube-pushing euro, you will really appreciate what new mechanics it introduces and what theme is present. It may not be a ground-breaking game set to alter the direction and design of modern games, but it does offer a fresh approach to a well worn genre, and it's certainly a splendid example of an attractive and thematic euro done well. As such, Village should deservedly go down in the history books as a worthy winner of the Kennerspiel award. This is an outstanding euro, that rightly comes highly recommended, and which fans of euro games should not miss.

Played at AnCon 2013 with Ryan and Sara - neat worker placement game that also incorporates a life span in your workers, which is a very neat and new mechanic.  Surprised to see how cheap this game is now (probably why is was the other option in the raffle - and Belfort is getting an expansion).  Would definitely be interested in playing again and would trade for it given something appropriate, but probably wouldn't be high on want list since Agricola is deeper, fills the role nicely, and there's also Archipelago and such.

The theme in this game is brilliantly executed, and though somewhat generic, it has enough charm to be engaging. Top quality components and gorgeous artwork make this a very appealing game.

Worker placement games are a dime a dozen these days, but this is one of the few that does something unique, in the form of workers that die of old age. This creates some interesting strategic dilemmas. Investing effort in end-game scoring buildings early (such as the Church and Town Hall) is difficult to do, as the workers may well die before the end of the game, but it also takes time to advance workers in these buildings. There is also an advantage to be gained by having workers from certain professions die early, as the spaces in the village chronicle fill up quickly.

Auf dem Spielplan sind verschiedene Bereiche eines Dorfes abgebildet, in denen der Spieler Aktionen ausführen kann. Auf allen Aktionsfeldern liegen Güter, die man benötigt, um voran zu kommen. Die Handwerker möchten in Gütern bezahlt werden. Im Politikbereich oder auf Reisen kommt man ebenfalls nur weiter, wenn man auch die entsprechenden Güter bieten kann.
Einige Dinge aber zahlt man mit Lebensalter. Immer, wenn eine bestimmte Schwelle überschritten wird, muss eine eigene Spielfigur sterben. Hier gilt es zu taktieren, damit nicht die strategisch wichtig positionierten Spielfiguren das Zeitliche segnen.
Wer stirbt, kann einen Platz in der Ahnengalerie einnehmen, für die es am Spielende ebenfalls Siegpunkte gibt.

It has a good solution to the problem of worker placement games bogging down as the game nears the end (because of multiplication of choices) and so is about the quickest playing strategic game I know of. We did get slower in the late game, maybe because our decisions had bigger and more immediate consequences. I've only played once, though, so I don't know what I'm talking about.

Nothing terribly novel here. It's worker placement with a little twist... workers dying and you trying to score points for it. 

4/4/13: Re-evaluated original assessment. Yes, it's another worker placement/resource management entry. However, it plays faster than many others in its genre, and is also family/spouse-friendly.

The theme is well made, and the board pretty. I especially like the way they use time - sometimes it is good, sometimes it is bad. There is quite a lot of different things to learn, but in the end it is quite simple and the pictures on the board help a lot. There are many ways to gain points, most don't rely on any luck but some do a bit.
Im not sure if it is only with my friends, but I dislike how it is impossible/improbable to win without getting lots of marketplace points.

RATING: 8
Rather original worker placement game with nice looking material. Theme feels very present.

What is special about this game is that your workers come in "generations". You have to be real careful which generations to put on the board because the older ones die earlier. This adds a new dimension to gaming (aging workers).

The game takes a bit long and there is a lot of setup work to do, also during the game, after each turn. What is missing is game tension. Probably because it's not clear during the game who is winning. 
Also the game lacks variation. What makes it kind of boring after a number of plays.

Minus: 3 (duration) - [-1]

RATING: 6
Maybe I’m jaded, maybe Village and I got off to a bad start, but after one play this seems like the quintessential soulless cubepusher that all those people must be talking about when they dismiss any game without dice. A couple of methods to garner victory points, a couple of completely interchangable resources that, unsurprisingly, get interchanged a lot, and exactly one new twist on the same-old, same-old in the mix.

The worst thing is that all of this comforting lack of originality did not at least add up to any challenging decisions in my first and probably only game– we each formed some kind of plan, made our moves roughly according to that plan, and ended up with extremely close results in spite of one experienced player against two newbies and wildly different approaches.

Awards and a lot of positive comments suggest that I’m missing something, here, but even if there is a lot more to Village than met my eye, I’m still bewildered why anyone would play this instead of classic Euros like Caylus or Puerto Rico, where both the tension and the skill factor are miles beyond what is on offer here.

What an emotional swing.  You start the game afraid to age your workers, needing their skills so desperately.  By late game, you are trying your best to kill them so that the glory of your family can live on forever! Besides the time aspect of the game, not much else is truly of note.  It is a worker "removal" game, so that is unique.

RATING: 5
Only played once so far. 4 rounds with 4 players. Nobody really got into the market, interestingly, and most people focussed on the church and travelling. Game ended because everybody put multiple Gen 1 people into crafting and they all died very quickly, filling up the unmarked graves.

I think that the first couple of rounds we were finding our feet, as there's a lot of options to choose from in a game. Once we got the hang of it we were breezing along and people were working out their strategy etc.

Ended up with 2 players out in the lead, one winning by 1 point. Thought it was a fun game, a bit deeper than Lords of Waterdeep, but perhaps not quite as fun. Definitely needs to be played a few more times.

edit: Played this numerous times as a 2 player game and enjoy it a great deal. Game is very well balanced, with any strategy seemingly a potential winner. Also bought Village Inn which really opens up this game and helps players to hone their strategy. Upgraded to a 9, regularly played, always enjoyed.

Only downside is the box itself: Death by baggies! A proper storage solution to aid in setting up and tearing down would make this a 10

edit Feb 14: Played this another 5 or 6 times. Have completely lost interest in it, and just don't enjoy it anymore. Will happily trade away.

Played with Tavern expansion.  This is a solid worker placement-type game with a neat death-mechanic for your meeples and lots of ways to earn VPs, but I just don't think this is my kind of game.

I am so impressed with this game! Excellent scalability. 

Update 7/20/14: Played this game with 4 today. Previously, we had only played this with 2, and it is EXCELLENT with 2. Of course, it's even better with 4. What a great game. We played with 2 muggles and the Village totally clicked for both of them by the end of the first round, maybe before. On the surface, this is not a gateway game, as its weight and variety of options can be quite daunting for a non-gamer. Interestingly though, it's that same variety that offers new players a good deal of options for strategic planning. You can literally just pick any part of the game, exploit it to the best of your ability, and still feel like your doing well. Plus, the game is not that "tight," even with 4. I felt like I got to do pretty much whatever I wanted. This looseness, if you will, opens the game up and eases the stress for non-gamers. Fantastic game. Can't say enough about how good it is. I never thought it could be a gateway, but I was wrong!

Village is your typical, run-of-the-mill, euro-style, worker placement game...except it isn't.  There is one substantial difference that elevates this above most other worker placements.  The difference is that there are multi-generational families in this game.  The family you control will have members born, live out their lives, and die over the course of play.  It's a simple twist on the typical mechanism within worker placements of getting more workers.  However, that twist allows Village to tell a compelling narrative of the life and times of the family you control.

Other than that it's standard stuff.  You put your workers out to gather resources, or complete other tasks that will garner points.  Whomever has the most points wins.

The components are very nice.  The board is a beautifully drawn rendition of a village complete with various buildings, roads, and people that your family will navigate through, and interact with.

Worker placement games can be boring affairs at times.  If you were to try just one, you would be making an excellent choice by visiting the good people of Village.

Love how your workers die that is a cool mechanic and great art. I played 2 2 player games of this and just was not a keeper for me.

Inn expansion provides more options in the worker "displacement" phase. Though the game becomes more swingy as a result. Each card, if it works out, scores an average of 3 to 6 points. Was hoping Inn brings personal or common objectives to the game. Otherwise, players might pursue similar strategy every game and lowers replayability.
[b]2015-09-26[/b] 8.1 to [b]7.9[/b]
It might not be fair that the base game's rating is being lowered because of the use of a new expansion. But the expansion Village Port does bring out a small down side of the game: slow buildup. The good thing with smaller turns is downtime is low between players. The player might not get as much satisfaction or sense of accomplishment every action but at least they don't have to wait for other people to do the same.

Very charming "worker displacement" Euro with a fitting theme. Once you get used to letting your meeples die, they drop like flies, giving much more urgency and strategic depth to the game. Recently expanded with Inm and Port.

One play with Inn and Port thrown in the mix. Was probably too much to chew on in a single play. The game felt disjointed, too many options while the base game still left many to explore. We'll limit this to one expansion in future plays.

I also have the following expansions:
* customer expansion
* Village Inn

After our first game, I'm just floored thinking about how elegant this Euro game is.  After first play, I can see not touching the manual except for remembering end-game scoring.

Looks like plenty of ways to score VPs.  Not only do randomly drawn color cubes determine how many times an action can be done, but actual color you pick has an effect on what you can do next, which also affects subsequent actions.

Well done components and functional board art.  Fun original theme and narrative during game.  Seems to play well at 2, and I'm guessing will be just as fun (if not more for contention for Mass) with more folks.  First game a 3 hours (which seems long), but see it going by faster with subsequent plays.

I've played quite a few Euros, and if I were to start rating, this would be up there.

09/08/12 Played a three-player game. The game's main difference from other Eurogame worker placement "cube pushers" is one's people die off after a time. This is rare, but its not unique (In the Shadow of the Emperor comes to mind). However the rest of the game is pretty much a standard worker placement cube pusher with multiple (7) paths to gaining victory points. So much so that it pretty much didn't matter what you did, you'd make almost the same amount of points as the other players. Overall I found Village a pleasant diversion that I could play a few times. Though nothing about it truly grabs me. In a word its inoffensive; not exaclty a ringing endorsement is it?  The artwork was nice, but nothing special (to me, after playing and rating over 550 games). I will say this, everything was logical and everything had a name. Example, each cube color actually represented something. That's more than I can say for some recent games I've played like Macao's  unnamed "action cubes" and Trajan's unnamed action cylinders (both these games are by the same designer of Village, Stefen Feld). I'll add there isn't much player interaction unless you consider picking up a certain cube before someone else does.

Yet another game I don't play nearly as much as I'd like to because some people don't like it very much. I find this game to be incredibly thematic and engaging. Players really have to keep an eye on each other and the book of death (cannot recall the official name). I love the Village Inn expansion as well. It adds so much to the game.

Immediately gain 2 prestige points on the prestige track.
Also choose 1 (and only 1) of the 3 villager decks. Gain 1 card of your choice from it by paying its costs (1 coin, 1 beer, or 2 beers) and take the card into your hand (or play it). Then return the villager deck to its place (without changing the order of the cards).

Well, I liked it, kind of, but it was not as compelling as I might have thought.  Indeed, the 'dying meeples' is interesting, but the scoring mechanisms seem to force you down a single path at the exclusion of others, and if things don't come out of the bag right, you could be screwed because of this.  Have to think more about this game.

[u]21-May-2013[/u]:  Village is a solid entry in the classic, cube-pushing, Eurogame genre.  You collect resources (Influence cubes), which allows you to take various actions, and in turn, earn victory points for end game scoring.  The one twist is that your family members, will pass away and (hopefully) be remembered in the Village Chronicle, the book of remembrance of those extra special villagers left their mark on society...and earn you victory points.

My few plays (two solo, one 2P) so far were very enjoyable.  My concern is that you may fall into a pattern rather easily in terms of where you want to earn your VP.  There are five main ways, I believe.  So you'll most likely do really well in two of them and hope your smaller VP areas are enough to beat out your opponents'.

Either way, if you enjoy a good Eurogame, I would definitely recommend you give this one a look.

[u]26-Jan-2014[/u]:  I've played this several more times now as the family took to it in the second half of 2013.  It's a well produced and solid entry in the Euro game arena.  It's all about multiple paths to victory and resource management.  The unique "dying" mechanism helps this one stand out amongst other, similar action selection games.  I feel the theme does show through the gameplay and is well worth adding to any collection.

Action selection game where players trigger actions at various stops in the village by taking cubes from the board. The cubes represent the various resources needed to purchase goods (carts, etc.) and pay for services within the village. 

There are a ton of ways to score victory points and players need to play both a tactical and strategic game to assure victory. The meat of the game is that actions are limited each round and timing is essential. Oh, speaking of time. Actions take time, the time you spend on actions age your workers. Yes, they die and you can score points if you time their deaths too. Of course there's an action to spawn future generations.

"I figured it was a game about optimizing your time and maximizing your VP output from your workers.

I then played against a handful of veterans. They CHURNED through their rivers of time, ending the game and filling the book before I realized what happened. It was crazy, and completely changed my view on the game.

Great great game, lots of interesting decisions to make. The initial set-up takes a bit of time, so it does need some plano solutioning."

RATING: 8
This is one of those games you hear so much hype about and worry if it is driven purely by its novelty. Your workers die? How inventive! But that's underselling it. I find the worker placement label for this game a misrepresentation. Your action selection is really driven by taking cubes which are various types of currency or punishment. Players may select an action they don't care about just for the currency or may grab a useless currency just for the action or may be blocking their opponents from either the action or the currency or both. However the most important currency may be time, which is novel not so much because it is "new" but because of how it is used--roughly speaking you start with an infinite amount of it and it is sometimes your most precious commodity and sometimes deadweight to be jettisoned. At times you are lamenting the untimely death of your wainwright before you made that final wagon and other times you can't kill off your farmer fast enough to solidify his place in the annals of farming celebrity. Timing these things to maximize their usefulness and then reassigning them, whether temporarily or permanently, is at the heart of the strategy. In fact the curse cubes, the aforementioned "punishments," are themselves of variable value throughout the game depending which way you want to push time. It is the intertwining of different *types* (not colors or labels or uses) of resources that differ in the very way they exist and transform that makes this game fascinating. I don't know if it will have infinite replayability, as the built-in variance is quite small and the currency distinctions themselves may be the novelty that wears off, but I want to play this one a lot more.

A very enjoyable mid-weight euro. I've played Village several times at my local gaming club, and it's been well-received by pretty much everybody who's played. The game offers a half-dozen or so different ways to pursue victory points -- with subtleties and dependancies that only become apparent after multiple plays -- but still plays briskly and doesn't get bogged down or outstay its welcome. Recommended.

Elsőre hosszúnak és bonyolultnak tűnő játékszabályzat, ami az átolvasást követően már egyáltalán nem néz ki hardcore-nak. A játék kifejezetten logikus, jól rásimul a tematikára. A dizájn rendben van, a komponensek is.

Egyedi mechanizmusok, kifejezetten szórakoztató, hogy még a családtagok halálát is jól kell tudni időzíteni. Morbidnak morbid, de kétségtelenül egyedi téma.

Két játékossal is jól működik, egyedül a játék végét (utolsó 2-3 fordulót) éreztem vontatottnak, alig akart megtelni a temető... Ez több játékosnál valószínűleg gördülékenyebb és nem kell körökön keresztül pótcselekedni.

A játék ennek ellenére egészen jó, megvenni ugyan nem valószínű, hogy meg fogom, de bármikor szívesen leülök majd elé, ha lesz rá alkalom.

A nice Eurogame with an original concept. Making the fame of a family in a village through time. Classic salad point system but with a different management of time and action taking than usual.

My first play of this was intriguing, and I'd willingly play again. I'm generally not a fan of resource management games, and that's pretty much all this is. But there's an ever so slight theme here, and the game creates a nice sense of an "ecosystem" that you can explore. I imagine a few more plays will ultimately result in my becoming sick of the game, but at least I don't feel the immediate disgust I usually do for this type of game.

ONE slow player can completely bog this game down, since every player gets SO many turns, and the game is designed to move quickly from player to player. Don't play this game with an AP-prone player.

First game play wasn't much of a success as two players knew the game and therefore had a big benefit during the game knowing how to play and score.

Village - der Name ist Programm, denn thematisch stellt das Spiel den Alltag in einem mittelalterlichen Dorf dar. Das klassische Konzept des "Worker Placement", wird durch viele coole Ideen angereichert, z.B. das Bezahlen mit der Ressource "Zeit" und das dadurch eigene Familienmitglieder (Arbeiter) sterben. Die vielen Möglichkeiten und Strategien geben einen hohen Wiederspielwert. Dringende Empfehlung: Holt euch die beiden Erweiterungen, sie heben das Spiel auf ein neues Level. Fantastisch!

While Village could be seen as a pretty standard cube-based worker placement game, the dying mechanic is something different, and really I feel like it forced me to think differently.  Other than that, at some points the game had a distinctly Caylus-like feel to it (and especially when comparing the Council Chamber in Village to the favor tracks in Caylus).  For me, that's a good thing.

Additionally, I found that referring to the cubes as 'skill', 'persuasiveness', 'faith', and 'knowledge' definitely helps the theme come through more than simply calling them orange, green, brown, and pink.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.8
There is a LOT going on here where you do one action to be able to perform another on your route to gaining victory points. The possible actions are carefully limited, and whilst the game mechanics mesh well together it is somewhat "fiddly".
This game is quite a "brain burner" and to me the playing experience feels more like hard work instead of an enjoyable couple of hours. So a game for those that revel in long hard slogs!

Really enjoyable worker placement game that offers up a satisfying combination of short an long term scoring systems. 

What sets it apart from rival worker placement titles is the aging mechanism whereby taking various actions costs time and when your time marker rounds your board, one of your villagers dies and you must always kill off one of the oldest villagers that remain. 

This may sound like a bad thing but dying can allow a family to enter the Chronicle, which simulates a villager achieving high status in one area of the village. 

All in all it is an engaging and varied experience that falls in the 50-80 minute time frame.

One of the good medium euros. I really like the dying in the right time mechanic for your workers. Apart from that, the game offers many ways of gaining VPs which is always good.

The theme, feel, and experience of this game are hard to match. Turns have a unique feel because the cube color isn't tied to the action area. This makes every round very different and full of interesting choices. The balance to keep family members alive to perform meaningful actions while trying to make their deaths happen at opportune times is very fun. The game is simple to teach and learn, and the components are great.

A worker placement game with a twist. There are lots of different strategies, and what I like most is it doesn't particularly reward or penalize you to diversify/concentrate on certain actions. The cutthroat-ness of the game is due to everything being so scarce - action selection, meeples, time and cubes, however some of them can be expended depends on your style of play. The right mix of tightness and rooms for creative play is what makes it one of the better Euro that came out recently.

RATING: 7.5
In a village, players choose actions between increasing family members, putting family members in the church, craft, council chambers or travelling. The unique mechanism in this game is that as time increases, your family members die off - some can earn you VPs if they make it to the right graveyard, otherwise, they score nothing in unmarked graves!

The mechanic in this game is that a player selects a colored cube in one of the areas in the village to execute the actions for that area. Different colored cubes are required for many actions, and at anytime, a  player can trade in 3 cubes of the same kind to execute an action at a location.

There are many ways to earn VPs, either by selling goods, or putting family members into the church. There are lots of different strategies to pursue and different approaches to the game. This is a good game, but I do have a couple criticisms: There is no balancing off for player order, so if you are playing a 4 player game, and there are 4 cubes in the birthing action, and one of them is black, the last player will take a black hit with no compensation. Maybe this isn't all bad, allowing you to get to the village chronicles first, but it is disadvantage as the other players are up one cube on you. Secondly, the game can end quite suddenly and you have to make sure you don't get caught with many cubes in your hand.

Not bad.  More of the same though in terms of "get these cubes, to exchange for these resources, to get these resources" routine, made interesting by the mechanism of your villagers passing away and having generations.

Great game, takes us a while to finish it though (about 30 minutes longer than we'd like).  The travel action doesn't work as well as I'd hope (takes a lot to travel but I understand why it's the way it is).  I'd like to see a bit more depth in the game.  My family holds me back from giving this a higher rating.  I will expand this game with one of the expansions over the next few months.

Very interesting mechanic where your meeples die off.  Very fun.  It does, however, feel like it needs something.  If it had one more level of complexity, I would probably rate this like Le Havre or possibly even Agricola.

RATING: 8
Your meeples die - and that should make you buy this game already. In a game full of strategy, seeing your little guys going to the book of memories - or not - is always fun - or sad, if you're an oversensitive fellow. The cubes, however, kills it a bit for me. They could've created an incredibly thematic and strategic medium Euro, but they decided to just aim low. Even the rulebook gives up fast on that: after naming each cube in the first page, it never again uses those fancy denominations, merely calling them 'black cubes', 'green cubes' etc.

De este juego solo puedo hablar bien. Es junto con el Agrícola uno de los juegos con los que me inicié en este mundo y rápidamente me sedujo. 
Es un juego muy versátil, consigue atrapar tanto a jugones como a noveles. En fin, un juego que entra en seguida por el ojo. 

En el apartado de las críticas, decir que quizá le falta un quinto jugador, y algunas cartas que le dieran un poco más de factor sorpresa. Decir esto es ventajista ya que cuando escribo esta reseña, sé que hay un extensión que soluciona estas dos cuestiones, y como en breve será aquí reseñada, esperamos pues.

Juego para tener siempre en la ludoteca esperando a esos amigos que vienen a cenar a tu casa, y que seguramente se presten a echar una partidaca.

I like that at the start of the game you are willing to spend the time and age the heck out of your people to get the items you need, but near the end every time point you spend feels like you're moving your family towards their inevitable demise.

Scoring is mostly visible and can be worked out, but is still a little bit of a surprise if you're not counting every point.

I had reservations about Village from what I'd seen of it on Shut Up & Sit Down. They liked it, but it just seemed to be another medieval-themed, worker placement, point salad. Well, nothing beats having low expectations proven wrong and that is what Village did. Yes, it was the medieval-themed, point salad I expected, but the generational nature of one's workers made for additional strategy in their placement. In this way it reminded me a bit of Small World.

A few strange things about Village are that one never needs to actually place one's workers, and no locations on the board are ever denied to another player's workers. Because of this, I don't really feel Village is a Worker Placement game as those types of games have an element of denying your opponents access to certain actions by getting there first, but in Village all actions are always available.

I'm not looking to add Village to my collection though. It is just too hard to explain to new players.

RATING: 8
While reading reviews and the rules I had in my head how this game would play being a worker placement and all.  It didn't.  More so than any other game (or close to it) this game plays MUCH differently than how I imagined it in my head.  That is not because of the death mechanic, although that is a large part, it is more about how actions are selected.  Taking away a cube to take an action is different and a bit hard to put your finger on until after playing.

If you describe this game as just another worker placement game, you are giving it a disservice, just for the fact that it is more accurately described as an action selection/worker placement.  

The added planning of deciding which family member to place and when to kill them off adds to the intrigue.  A solid game 'in that genre', but quite different than many you have played before.

A solid '8' after a 4 and 2 player game.

RATING: 8.5
For a new euro it felt quite fresh; if the mechanics were a pastiche of existing ones, they were either artfully disguised or from games I've not yet played. In particular I liked that the game-ending mechanic is tied to the meeple-killing one, and I enjoyed the tension behind timing the speeding up of time. I would hate to have to explain this one to a new player, though.

it is not a bad game, it reminds me of trajan, several ways to earn vps but it feels patched up. there is one nice idea, the early retirement of meeples, the rest is seen in other better games. it felt ok to play, good tension, but it needs to be played fast.

Rating (7) based on first play. Something just seems to be missing in Village. I don't say this very often, but an expansion, mainly Village Inn just feels like an essential purchase.

EDIT. When paired with Port-expansion, Village comes to life. Life goals makes a huge difference, and with extended travel possibilities you simply cannot do everything which was bit of a downside in base game to me.

RATING: 8.5
Worker placement game that simulate the different generations of some families living in a village. It made me remember Gabriel García Márquez's "100 años de soledad" :D. Your workers actually die, but you can get sons, great-sons and great-great-sons.

The game offers you many choices and from what I have tested, many different paths for victory. Up to now, I have found it perfectly balanced.

Even if at its core it is a worker placement game where you move cubes, transform them, and so on, if you come to think it, the theme is very well integrated (the different families, the different cubes each meaning some skill or quality that allow you do different things depending on that skill/quality, etc).

And it's not a long game, you can really play it in 70-90 minutes.

For me, it's a game with many "likes" and no "dislikes" :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
First impression (4 players): 
Take actions, (sometimes) place workers. That one "new" thing of the game is that some actions make your workers older and at some point have to die. Dying doing right things still awards (potential) points so it's not all bad. Except that then you'll have less workers (but can gain more).

Several ways seem to give chance to win. I liked feel of the mechanics and some of theme (tabletalk) that this whole "cycle of life" thing brings even though it was more of our group than the game really.

Our scores have been fairly high but have been decreasing steadily with each play...winning scores have gone from 94 to 89 to 76.  The more you play, the more you get the feel for handling the time track; our first play we tried not to kill off Villagers too quickly but in the last game, we were not as reluctant...

I own Carson City and that one captures the worker placement aspect alot better than Village. The neat aging-aspect of Village wears off quickly and the rest of the theme falls somewhat flat. After that all there is left to Village feels like cube pushing for the sake of it. I stick with Carson City which has a great immersion of theme, where you can fight for your spots if necessary and get the feel of building a wild west town!

Ottimo gioco ben bilanciato che offre diverse strategie. Prodotto vincente per via di diversi fattori: regolamento facilmente assimilabile, setup veloce, scala molto bene con il variare del numero dei giocatori, durata accettabile (poco più di un'ora) e non ha tempi morti. Se vogliamo esser severi possiamo notare che non spicca per originalità se non per il fatto che 'uccidere' i membri della propria famiglia porta punti vittoria e a volte conviene farli fuori prima degli avversari...

Clever? Yes. Interactive? As much as one can expect from a Euro.

If you still want to buy it, the above should be as much as you need. For everyone else, it's a gut-wrenching, over-long, dull-as-buggery cube-pusher.

Begods, it's not terrible. There is lots of clever stuff in the timing and the oh-so-painful way the time track disposes of key men.

But, at the end of the day, it's the over-production of games exactly like this that will spell death for the modern Euro.

This game is a "7" without the Port expansion. I give it a 10 with Port. For me it's not an expansion, Port is a PATCH :) You may or may not play it with the first expansion (Inn), cause it adds some flavour to the game, but the second expansion (Port) kind of FIXES the travelling part of the game. You score while travelling AND sell stuff you take with you to the lands you travel to AND you later sell in the Market stuff you brought from your travellings. AND you bring back treasure chests with money. It is a totally different game, do not play it without the Port expansion, buy the Inn if you really really like this game like me, but do not try this game without Port if you can afford it.

This game feels like a really cool sandbox to me. Every time I play I see so many different options and paths to victory, and have seen the game won in many different ways. Timing is very important.

Tighter than I anticipated!  I love the idea of the dying villagers, but the deaths come around a little too quickly for my taste.

Having the deaths come in strategic locations and times is very interesting.

One of those Euros where you can admire the breadth of the design and the work which must have gone into it to make it balanced and interesting, and the gradual killing off of meeples due to the build-up of time-cost of doing actions is kind of interesting, but it's ultimately an exercise rather than fun. An exercise in developing a base strategy in one of the key ways to score points (markets, travel, church, etc), concentrating on investing in the tools needed to execute that strategy well, and then grinding it out until enough meeples have died to trigger the end of the game at which point you add everything up. There's enough replay in the game to allow you to explore the different facets ... if that's the kind of challenge you're after. At least it's an organically satisfying ending (enough deaths) rather than the rote set number of rounds that too many games rely on.

"Solid action-drafting game that requires careful planning. A bit static without the expansion."

What I like:
- Solid "action drafting" (nee worker placement) game, with multiple paths to victory
- Some blocking, and minor majority aspect, but no attacks
- The theme holds the game together quite well

What I don't like:
- Cubes detract from the theme
- Some of the board iconology could be clearer
- I slightly prefer games with a fixed end, rather than allowing players to speed/slow the game
- The static board may hurt replayability eventually
- 2p might get quite cutthroat (not sure yet)

It's a good game. I'm having trouble loving it, but I'm also having trouble coming up with complaints about the game. It's too complex for non-gamers. Originally I thought the weight was 2.9 (below the BGG 3.1), but after watching gamers try to learn it from the book, I think 3.2 is a better guess (due to complexity more than depth). 

Our 4p learning game was a bit long (2 hrs), but a 2p game took just under 60. One 4p game with 2 first-timers took 2.25 hours after .5 hours of rules, which is really too long.

Rating is a high 7 without the expansion; low 8 with.

Finally! It arrived today! 08/02/2012.

Great game with good nice and fresh mechanics! Eggertspiele certainly are walking the right direction! I love the way the game progressively unfolds and how players get more and more aware of their choices! Fantastic stuff here! Even meeples die! This has stuff to be among the great ones, will need a few more goes though to confirm this nifty suspicion! :)

- The rulebook is good, well structured and has loads of colour coded examples and well written! The game is not easy to explain since things on the board to seem very well related at first, but after one you get the "oh I see!" effect.

It's just nice to see the village develops. It is deep and simple. Sometimes it is even philosophical. I love to see the villagers going in a journey to earn fame and fortune!

One play left me very conflicted. It wasn't what I thought it would be, at first. I had some initial hatred for it, but mulling on it a few days left me feel very different.

After reflection, I realized my initial reaction was because the game was forcing my brain to work in different ways. 

The whole "utilizing your guys at the right time, but also planning their little deaths to happen at the right time so you can get recorded in the Book of Death (is that what it's called?)" was totally messing with my head. I don't remember seeing that combo before.

I think I'm gonna need to get this game.

This is a fairly original Euro with mechanics that are not very evident in how they blend together. You take cubes from the board to perform actions, these are predetermined in their quantity, but the cubes are also resources, so you must select your actions and collect resources with the same mechanic and it definitely does not work out easily. Using your meeples you place them around the board to get points and benefits, but they will also die, so that must also be times in addition to fighting with others on actions and resources. A nice Euro where the path to victory is not evident.

For all the hype this game received, I was a little underwhelmed.  There are two basic ideas going on here: converting your cubes into points, and racing to get your dead guys into the book.  People tend to view "wasting time" as a bad thing, but it's not, because you want to kill off your guys as quickly as possible.  What's interesting is balancing the two ideas: you have to make sure the guys you're killing off aren't the guys getting you most of your points.  Once you understand that, the game is fairly straightforward.  A little bland, even.

A decently fun game made better with the expansions. While the death mechanic isn't exactly super unique, but it adds a nice timing element to the game. I look forward to more plays of this, but it's kind of fallen by the wayside. Not sure of the legs on this one or the variety of strategy, but it's been pleasant each time.

Base game, market feels rather strong. It seems lessened by the expansion(s), but it's rather hard to ignore. Some of the other paths also feel weak (traveling). Maybe we haven't played it enough, but those are my general observations so far.

***

Several years have past since I played it for the first and only time.. and I have no real desire playing it again. I have looked into the rulebook a couple of times after that first play, trying to pick it up again, but I just get bored. I usually like to read rules

I don't know, there is something that is really off-putting & convoluted about this game. 

***

Just one 4-player yet..

This game actually adds some context to your usually anonymous meeples, and that's nice. Good integrated theme. 

Interesting mechanics this "cube picking" to select an action. Of course, the cubes availible for your desired action - if there are any left - is not necessarily one that might come in handy for _that_ particular action. So you often do many actions to be able too realize some other actions later on. 

My concern is that the rounds seems like too long before all the cubes have been picked up. Sometimes it feels like you run out of interesting options before it is time to hold a mass prior to a new round.

Anyway, aside from the complaint above this game gave a pretty good first impression.

I love abstractions, and have no problem with themeless euros. But Village just does not come across as remotely interesting, as I feel I can see right through the game, into its very basic mechanisms. Grabbing cubes, very bland traveling, and a "dying worker" mechanism that on paper sounds very interesting, does nothing for me. My patience for themelessness did have a limit after all. Go figure.

It gets some points for originality though.

Just picked this game up.  Cool worker placement with charming possibly 19th century village life theme.  Really unique currency in the game...time! (read life).  Part way through the game it hits you that you are, at times, trying to hasten the death of your older family members to win.  Leaves you with an odd feeling but doesn't seem to dampen the enjoyment of the game.  Is that wrong?  Scoring is delightfully simple for a Euro with several paths to victory.

RATING: 8
Fun game. There's a lot of options, and everyone went for a different strategy, and all of them seemed viable (3p game, 2 of us tied for first place, the third player wasn't too far behind either). I like the cube taking mechanic, as it makes you really think about the order in which you take the actions, and sometimes what you want to do and what you need (cube wise) just don't match. Also, it was quite easy to understand what the options were, everything makes sense; it's one of those games where I think I'll remember the rules without needing much of a refresher, even after one play, and even if we wouldn't play again for quite some time. There was some thinking, but no real AP (except maybe in the last round).

Rock solid cube pusher, of the "there are x different areas to score points, so figure out where you want to focus and where you want to dabble"-variety.

Interesting action draft system where you pull cubes from the board to perform an action, so you must weigh the type (color) of a cube vs. the connected action, and guesstimate how likely it is that there will still be available cubes - and thus, actions - next turn if you skip it and give the other players a chance to take it.

There are enough paths to victory that getting beaten to the punch or screwed out of a spot barely hurts; plan B is almost as good.

Village feels like one of the better medium-weight "collect cubes and meeples and chits and trade them for points in a dozen different ways"-games out there; that said, there are a million similar games, and Village doesn't bring enough to rise above the other ones.

Fun game where actions are taken by removing a resource from an action area and then adding it to your stockpile. The different areas get seeded with new resources each round. In addition, some actions need you to send a worker to go stand in a spot, and some actions require you to spend "time" which is a personal resource you have on the front of your board. When the time counter makes a full rotation, your lowest numbered worker dies. If he dies doing the right thing in the right spot, he'll be worth endgame points to you. If not, he'll just advance the endgame faster.

The game is similar to Feld games in that every area of the board is it's own little mechanic and each gives points. The mechanics can feel a little cumbersome sometimes, because from early on in the game you want to both get the most out of your pawns, but you also need to kill them fast enough to ensure they are worth something later on. It's an interesting tension.

It's rare for a game to feel relaxing and competitive at the same time.

I believe I didn't felt the theme so much in the beginning, but the more I see it play, the less competitive it gets (I'm too competitive I think) and the more I feel the theme in it.

Sometimes you'll lose, but still feel proud of your family on board, and THAT must mean something.

It’s one of my and my wife’s favorite games.  With base game alone market is somewhat over power so you always have to stay in the market arm race.  Also participate in an area with less competition and you will have a good chance.  Adding inn and port makes this game much more balanced and you truly have multi path to victory.  However, market is still a must, but not as important as just the base game alone.  Strongly suggest to play with all expansions.

Nice take on worker placement/action points. The mechanism of taking cubes which can be used as resources is clever. Also like the time element were the oldest workers die off. Falls into the raft of games that give you multiple ways to achieve victory points. Good trade off between having to retain workers to get resources for points, and have them score points with the limited number legendary remembrance. 
Unlike some of the other point salad games that force diversification - this seems to reward specialization.

At first I liked it quite a bit, but with each game the excitement dropped rather fast. The mechanics are fine, can't say anything bad really, and the twist with dying workers interesting - really makes you think which family member should do what. But there's no thrill to it and it feels horribly repeatable (after just a few games, which is quite telling). Despite the morbid theme, I'd say this is a family game. Pleasant, relaxing and all in all enjoyable, but... but there are simply better games out there. 

If it had a bit more interaction... I don't know, somehow it just didn't grab me. It's just a bit too peaceful, even for an eurogame; no room whatsoever for cunning, mean moves - and at the same time not thinky or puzzly enough. If it's a low interaction type of game, it should at least give me a headache. "Village" did not.

The graveyard/time mechanic is wonderfully innovative for worker placement games. Players should be very familiar with the end game scoring conditions before playing this one, as just about everything plays a part and it's a very tight race to the finish. 

The plague cubes are an interesting twist too. Originally I thought they were something to be avoided and later discovered their strategic value of rushing the end game and getting meeples into the chronicle quicker than your opponents.

Overall, Village is a very neat design with mechanics that flow elegantly throughout. I can only see this rating going up with future plays.

Here's a video play-through and review:  http://www.boardgamegeek.com/video/42073/village/the-charters-village-play-through-and-review

Fun worker placement game.  Twist is that your 11 workers are from 4 generations and as you take actions that take time, your older workers will die off.  The timing of when/how you kill off your older workers is a strategic and tactical element of this game.

Rather than place your meeples to select actions, each round the board is seeded with resource cubes, and to take actions you pick up a cube in that area of the board.  So you collect resources in the same mechanism that you select your actions.  Very unique mechanic!   Sometimes  you really want the resource but don't care about the action.   other times you really want to take a particular action, but you don't care about the resource that you will get...the resource (plague cube) can sometimes hurt you.

Good game.  Recommended.

In my view Village is the epitomy of a cube pusher Euro game. There is a pasted on theme of doing different things in a medieval village, but all mechanisms feel totally gamey and seem to be there for their own sake. Actually, village is my go-to example for having a complete disconnect between game mechanisms and theme (aka "pasted on theme"). 

You gather ressources automatically by actually doing completely other things (I am not even sure if the ressources have names apart from green/brown/orange/rose); to get villagers into the church they have to be (more or less) randomly drawn from a bag; you can only get children, if there are ressources left on the corresponding action area.

At least the time mechanism and letting your villagers die (such that they are remembered in the village's chronicles) is quite neat, but still very gamey. This is for sure a well designed modern Euro game, but with its victory point salad and totally pasted on mechanisms it does not hit the right spot with me.

Contagiante, um jogo complexo mas no qual o jogador se envolve facilmente e acaba por ficar "apanhadinho" por uns tempos... A beleza do tabuleiro e dos componentes convida a experimentá-lo, a particularidade da sucessão das gerações confere-lhe um cariz único e a variedade de opções permite-lhe uma replayhability eterna. Village é um mimo de jogo!

This is a good game with two players. Too slow and just too long with five players. I suspect this is almost 2 hours with four players, it is way too much. If this game would take around 60 minutes then I'd be happy to play it.

Fairly heavy worker placement game with some clever twists. The aging worker mechanic is a nice touch. The kind of game where you try out new strategies each time you play. But it still just another engine and VP optimization game with very little interaction. Record a session of this in play and all you'll hear is the faint ticking of wooden bits being place on a board. This is about my rating ceiling for that kind of game these days.

For some reason we've only played this once, a 2p game between my wife and I, just after she got it for Christmas back in 2013! It is strange that we've not played it since, since we both quite liked it. I found it to be an interesting take on the tried and tested worker placement genre. You want your meeples to die so that you get VPs for them, but you don't because while on the board they serve a valuable purpose! This leads to quite some dilemmas, which I look forward to exploring on future plays - especially as I'm sure this is better with 3 or 4 than with 2. But it looks increasingly unlikely that those future plays will ever happen. And while I think this certainly deserves further plays, I wasn't excited by it enough to have ever actively suggested it since.

The main draw for me to this game is not with it's mechanics, but in its theme. If you're looking for a good worker placement, there are better options other places. If you're looking to use your imagination, there's nothing quite like this. Pulling the drunkard in the family back to the farm before he ends up drinking himself to death at the tavern, and then having that family member die a peaceful death back on the farm is one of the most thematic moves in gaming.

The main problem with this game is it doesn't do enough to change things up from play to play. Village Inn certainly helps, though. I still need to try Village Port.

First impressions are that it's deeper than it looks.  There are several layers to the strategy - cube colour is almost as important as picking the right action space.  Not sure how to really use the Church space - early on it seems a bit pointless apart from just filling up the Chronicle.

I didn't know much about Village until my girlfriend told me a story. She had it on her Amazon wishlist. One of her friends noticed this and told her "We have that at home, it never ever gets played - would you like it?". Resolutely refusing to take any money for it - we had a free game! I read the rules, watched a quick "how to play" and we were ready to go.

It didn't take long before both of us really got into this game! It's got so many mechanics we both love - being a well thought out worker placement game. It also has a mechanic that we hadn't seen before - your workers can die of old age! Wow, this is a great twist on the normal mechanisms of a worker placement. As well as dying, you also want them to die quicker than your opponent so they don't go into the unmarked graves! I love it when a game brings out a new mechanic I've never seen before.

Component wise, box is solid and all the pieces are quite functional. Sticking on the numbers to pieces is a little annoying but it's only a one-off, so something I can easily suffer through. What is great is that you get an entire extra set of stickers - just in case you manage to mess up with placing them. While I didn't need them, it was a great insurance to have! Artwork is very nice throughout the game.

All of the actions are well thought out and nothing seems particularly overpowered. The merchant maybe seems a bit underpowered/expensive to use, but this is a minor complaint. I wasn't overly happy with the travelling aspect of the game, but we've recently picked up the Port and Inn expansions. The Port expansion looks to really improve the travelling aspect of the game (I've heard it referred to as a "patch", not an expansion) so I'm looking forward to trying it out.

Overall, I think this is a superb Euro game and one that I'm exceptionally happy is now in my collection!

The aging is neat, the way the different actions interact is neat, the temp is neat, and the resource management manages to feel fresh.  The game also feels like it moves at a good pace with a constant time crunch, rather than slogging through periods of just building up to something interesting.

25-07-15. Rated after 1 play. I am late to the village party, not being a euro gamer much.

In Village you take actions by grabbing cubes from places. These places give you actions, for which you can place a dude at the location.. signaling your 'glfamily' of meeples has a member (meeple) is doing that task (Traveling, beng clergy etc). Fun thing is that the game tries to simulate multiple generations and since time is a resource, your old meeples (lvl 1 meeples) die at some point and either lived rich and learning lIves and end up in a remembrance book.. or end up dead in an unmarked grave.  Funnily enough,  this is the endgame timer.

I did like my one play of it well enough, the mechanisms felt solid. However, I felt.the game was quite dry and methodical.For it's genre it's ok, but for myself I'd want something more. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.76
The passage of time is constantly measured in this worker placement game and as workers grow old and die, they are replaced with a 2nd and maybe a 3rd generation of workers to take their place. I have to say that burying your workers in the graveyard is original but a little morbid.

This game is unique and  really a fun game.You play a family that is  just living everyday life in the  villiage.  The object of the game is to become the most famous family in the village through your families generations. You can be famous for Exploring , entering government serving in the church etc. Your family members age and die off losing actions you can perform but can  get written into the history books for blazing a trail in their field scoring prestige points for your family.So a player needs to use their actions most productively while they are alive but still making sure your workers make an impression on the village when they pass away. I have not played anything like it.

Pros: Unique gameplay,  need to develped a balance approach, no harsh atttacking of other players in the game.Interesting theme and engaging game mechanisms.Beautiful artwork,Deep decisions making game  and strategy.

Cons: Gameplay may seem a little abstract

RATING: 8
Village may seem like standard worker placement fare, but it is much more than it appears at first glance. It contains one really novel idea: natural death of workers over time. This mechanic adds a great layer of strategy to the overall game, and it’s constantly a challenge to choose which workers will bite the dust first. Overall strategy seems fluid and adaptable: you don’t necessarily have to decide your main focus until round 2/3. This is a huge plus in my book, and it definitely avoided some frustration of having your strategy completely shut down through Caylus-esque blocking: someone can put his foot in your path, but not close the door. I also really like how the influence cubes are named and appropriately spent on activities that would need them, i.e. the brown faith cubes are used primarily at the church but also during travel.

The artwork in this game is absolutely phenomenal, and I really can’t say enough good things about it. In fact, it bumped my rating up by one full point. The style is subtle, practical and beautiful. Troyes was the last time I was impressed this much by the art. The bits are of high quality, and the rule book is excellent. Hopefully this game will get a wider distribution and earn the accolades it rightly deserves.

Perfectly pleasant game that I am happy to play from time to time. Not a favorite. Some interesting decisions throughout, though not so many as to be overwhelming, so a nice balance there. Game time has a tendency to go longer than you would hope--particularly with a new player at the table--to the point where I will resist playing this now unless everyone knows the rules. I witnessed a 4-player game go on for over three hours...this game is not nearly good enough to warrant that.
UPDATE: Village has upgraded in my opinion since those earlier thoughts. Interesting to me, to read them now. Years later, I think that Village deserves to be mentioned as a game that has made the cut in my house, and honestly is a minor classic.

While I'm not a big fan of worker placement, this was an interesting take on the genre.  This game definitely FEELs different than many other similar games and has a nice weight-to-depth ratio (from the perspective of someone who likes light->medium weight games).  The only thing I didn't really like is it sometimes felt hard to push the game along if you felt you were in a good position.  Arguably gauging how long the game is going to go is part of the strategy though.

I absolutely love the concept of this. I'm more attached to the workers here than in any other game. Some have miserable and insignificant lives, others are triumphant point-scorers, but most will inevitably die to make way for the new generation. But it's not too morbid as the departed are usually honoured as pioneers (what a lovely message!). A changing pool of workers also makes your strategy seem more fluid -- your focal strategy naturally decays and you tend to move on to a new one. By design, all parts of the board will see action in every game, and the interconnectedness of each part rewards forward thinking and a well-rounded approach.

Yes the coloured cubes are silly and abstract but I really don't pay any attention to that. I do fault the game in that without an expansion it feels incomplete (and it is -- it was designed with Inn included before being surgically removed) and I would probably rate an 8. But if you can tap into the narrative theme of life and death you may just love Village as much as I do.

Orange-pink discernment can be rough in dim light. 

Otherwise, another one of these worker placement churning economic engine games that seem like work to me. This one's a bit better than most, like Fresco, but still nothing I'd ever feel keen to play. Lots of expansions might add variety, but in the end, you just start her up and churn them points out and hope you get the edge. A bit too long, to boot.

A quite fresh medium-weight euro. Lots of strategies to pursue, no negative interaction, no stress or difficult decisions, neutral theme, make for a good family game. I have played it only a couple of times, but have an impression that while some strategies are somewhat better than others, the final result may ultimately depend on random factors. I might be wrong and it may be just that it's difficult to say which move was wrong afterwards, but playing the same strategy against the same people will sometimes gain me a victory, and sometimes not.

Bottom line: it's a pleasurable experience, best played for the joy of it and not for ruthless fighting for points.

RATING: 7
Early impression: that the game is nice enough, but a little bit lacking in a certain spark, probably owing to the abundance of possible actions that have very close net end results. The test will come with replayability. 
After 4 plays - racing to score and kill off your family, balancing when to take the developing actions (growing family, making goods) and when to reap... We're finding the 2 player game to be fast (30 - 45 minutes - currently lasting about 3 full rounds) and so far promising sufficient variability - what actions represent the best opportunity will vary depending on the mix of cubes available and customers on the market. There's something fun about filling the grave slots (and interesting that that's just about the only blocking move available), and controlling when to kill the game is absolutely key.

I like the way the number of designated influence cubes is a (soft) limit to the number of times actions can taken in a location. Combined with the scoring methods, ageing and dying of workers and the end game trigger it works really well to create a timing tension. With multiple paths to both scoring points and acquiring resources the game feels very open to trying different ideas out game to game. It's not a deep, deep game, but one that hits the middle weight family ground well enough. Turns keep flying by at a good pace and it's an enjoyable experience. (Applying stickers is a pain, but the publisher is a thoughtful one and provides some spare stickers.)

Reverse worker placement game, in which players take cubes from the board to perform actions. Then, it is just another game of gathering resources to exchange them for victory points in different ways. The innovation is that time passes by, and some of your workers will die, so players will have to choose, from time to time, to put away one of their oldest pawns in play.

Interesting how many people describe Village as "just another worker placement game", when in fact it is not your typical worker placement game at all. For starters, you are never required to place any workers to do your actions, and when the "workers" do get placed, it never blocks anyone else from taking the same action. It is better described as a resource gathering/action selection game, where the amount of resources out on the board constrain the number and types of actions players can take. 

Adding the Village Inn expansion for this game is definitely worth it and the replay value goes up significantly. The twists and turns of what cards become available in the inn force players to respond and adds a nice tactical element to the game.

For some reason, something kept me from getting this game for a while.  It seemed too simple.  However, the death mechanism kept me coming back to look at it, and I am glad I did.  That mechanism creates such an interesting dynamic to the worker placement genre, along with a layer of theme as you can feel connected to your workers and hate to see them go.  Add Village Inn and you have a lot of options to score points.

The theme of this game (a family in a village over generations) is very abstract, so the abstraction of the mechanics does not really detract from the theme like it does in some euro games.

Good solid Eurogame. Well integrated theme (although the cubes seemed a bit meaningless to me - however they work ok game-wise). I'm trying to cut down on the number of games I buy, and some Euros are starting to pall now (in a "been there done that" sort of way) so the fact that this has made it tentatively onto my wish list (and now purchased!) is noteworthy.

What. A. Mess.

The contrived situations engendered by Eurogames taken to an extreme. You need cubes and stuff, and it's really just about finding the intersection that works best for you after chugging through a calculator. All worker placement and open information and cold, contrived dead things to consider, not a single smidge of soul.

We played it while balancing cellphone conversations and interruptions, and nobody was really the worse of wear for it.

Here's another game that I hadn't gotten a chance to play, but now that I have, boy am I thrilled.  It has a lot of cool elements - dying family members, selling goods to customers, traveling the roads.  I love how the cubes you take don't necessarily match up with the actions you take them from.  This is a top-notch game that I am looking forward to getting to the table more often.

Interesting death mechanic where you score points for villagers that died based on that villager's profession.  Some actions require you to spend time to take the action, once you've spent a certain amount of time one of your oldest villagers dies and goes to the graveyard (assuming there is still space).

This is a game that I think most people will enjoy playing at least a few times.  It is really a worker placement game, but instead of placing a worker you remove a cube from the board... when all cubes are gone, the round is done.

I do think replayability is somewhat limited which is why I did not give an 8+ rating, but I definitely enjoyed my first 3 plays of the game.

RATING: 6
Like the majority of current Euros, Village features a novel central mechanism tossed in together with a rehash of familiar side mechanisms. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as the signature death mechanism is worth the price of entry alone. 

The death mechanism carries a few interesting implications. One, some careful timing is required to balance squeezing efficiency out of workers and earning a spot in the chronicle. Two, the game end is determined by the players, and a rash of deaths can see the game end faster than expected. Three, the impermanence of workers and competition to get a spot in the chronicle requires players to invest in different VP paths at different points of the game in order to do well. 

Unlike most middle-weight Euros, the pace of gameplay in Village is relaxed and resources are not as tight as one would imagine. After over 10 games, I've found that Village does not hold up well to repeat plays. There isn't enough variability in the set up or sufficient friction between players to ensure each game is a unique experience. 

So while Village is worth exploring for a game or two to experience the death mechanism, it doesn't have the staying power that keeps the game fresh after multiple plays.

HUGE colour blindness problems with this one.  The green and brown cubes are completely indistinguishable from each other, and it's important to know what is what.

Egyik olyan játék, amit látatlanban majdnem megvettem, így első játék után bánhatom, hogy nem tettem, mert jól ráéreztem, jó játék a Village. Tulajdonképpen két új dolgot lehet a játékban felfedezni. A legérdekesebb az akcióválasztó mechanizmus. A lehetséges akciókat ugyanis annyiszor lehet végrehajtani minden körben, ahány kocka rajtuk szerepel. Amikor valaki akciót akar végrehajtani egy adott helyen, onnan elvesz a még ott levő kockákból és utána hajthatja végre. A különböző színű kockák nem csak a számosságot mutatják, hanem különböző akciókhoz használhatók fel. A másik különlegesség a munkáslerakós stílust kicsit úgy dobták fel, hogy munkásaink idővel elhaláloznak és a temetőbe kerülnek. Adott számú sír betelte hozza el a játék végét is. Ez a két érdekesség, a gyönyörű kivitel és a jól kiegyensúlyozott akciók nagyon jó játékot adtak ki végül. Fanyalgásra csak a templomban levő szerencsés húzás adhat némi okot, de az pénzzel megoldható, illetve a játék végefeltételének nem könnyen kalkulálható volta. De ezek apróságok. Valószínűleg minden játékosszámmal jól működik a Village, bátran ajánlom a munkáslerakós stílus kedvelőinek.

[2012-08-23]
Második játékra változott a véleményem. Ismét 5 körös volt a játék, így a hirtelen befejezés semmiképp sem negatívuma a játéknak. Az viszont már igen, hogy nem érzek benne sok újrajátszhatóságot. Azt hittem a kockák mindig máshogy feljövetele sokat számít, de tulajdonképpen nagyon semmit. A kereskedőlapkák váltakozása se visz nagy különbséget egy-egy játékba. Vannak gyengébb és erősebb pontot hozó részek a játékban, így igazi változatosságot csak különböző emberekkel való játék okozhat. Szóval rontok egyet a ponton. Jól összerakott, szép játék, nem túl vészes játékidő, de semmi igazán kiemelkedő.

This is the kind of game that I'm not too good at and therefore don't love - a lot of resources (5? cubes that represent "stuff", grain, money, different craft items, etc.) and a lot of conversion. However, the death, and the need to die at the right time, pushes this game into a game I had fun with, even though I lost terribly. This game didn't come with a player aid and I think it seriously needs one; each place you visit operates differently from each other spot and while some are graphically represented on the board ("traveling" - not sure why that earns points exactly), others like the church and "politics" are not. It's a game I liked but hoped I would like more.

This game is a hoot. You could see it as a bland Euro, you're picking up cubes and then doing actions, sometimes paying cubes for them, sometimes paying other stuff, but the whole thing comes together into really innovative set of game systems, that makes the theme shine. The key mechanism is the aging/dying mechanism. Most stuff that you do ages you (it takes time!). Plague also ages you (duh!). Every certain number of aging steps a family member (worker) dies. Bummer, eh, but not totally. You're also trying to fit people into the Village chronicle, and dying at the right time in the right job can equal extra points.

I really like the various victory paths. I totally ignored travelling points and made most of my points trading, and won by 1 point! I haven't played enough to know if every path is viable but it feels like most should be. The game has some random elements but they are only moderate and shouldn't annoy any except the most anti luck people.

Now I need to try the expansions!

Adds a new twist on the worker placement genre (enough to warrant buying). Players control generations of a family in a medieval village, trying to further their careers in trades, farming, religion, travelling, selling or civics. The catch is that the hall of fame only has space for a limited amount of villagers so dying first is a necessity. The rush to kill off family members in particular trades is fun and interesting. Great game.

1 play, 4er.

Wow, there is a lot going on in this game! I'm going to need to play this again, hopefully soon, to see if I can figure it out -- 'cause I sure didn't in this first game! Pretty enjoyable game, over all.

--- Summary ---
The board shows several locations where you can take actions such as, for example
- recruit an extra worker
- buy a plow, horse, ox, or wagon
- produce or sell grain
- place or advance a worker in the council (with better bonuses awarded as you advance further along the track; more VP at end of game, as well)
- place or advance a worker in the church (VP award at end of each turn and end of game)
- sell some combination of tokens for a VP chit (worth 3-6 VP and end of game)
- etc.
There are (at least!) 3 twists here:
1. At the start of each game turn, seed each location with a number of cubes (based on player count, and in a random assortment of colors drawn from a bag of cubes composed of a mix based on player count). To take an action, you have to take a cube in the appropriate location (if available). Many actions will require you to spend specific combinations of cubes.
2. Many actions also require some amount of time: advance your time marker on your personal track to show time passing. If you took a black cube in (1), you also advance 2 spaces on your time track.
3. Whenever your time marker makes a full trip around the track, you must kill off one of your workers from the earliest generation (start the game with gen-1 workers; as you recruit workers, you move through the generations) currently in play. The killed worker goes either to the Book of History (or whatever it's called), if there's still space for a worker of that type (specific number of spaces for church workers, councilmen, farmers, etc.); if not, go to the unmarked graves. The game ends when either the book or the graveyard is full. At the end of the game, you'll earn VP for having several workers in the Book.

When the game ends, you get additional VP for leftover money and cubes, as well as the VPs for being in the Book, and advancing in the Church and Council. Most VP wins.

This is just a great Euro through-and-through. The game rules are easy to grasp, various strategies become apparent after a few rounds of play, the turns flow smoothly, and it plays in just the right amount of time, even at 5 players (i.e. it never feels like it overstays its welcome). 

As with most Euros, the player interaction isn't super high, the but competition for certain action spots can get pretty intense. It has a very similar feel to a worker placement game.

Sure, it's not super deep but it's just fun to play. The port expansion is almost essential in my opinion -- travel is too weak a strategy in the base game. The inn expansion adds more options, but isn't essential.

RATING: 8
A resource collection game with pseudo-worker placement elements.  In other words you could also title this game "Euro McEurogame".  I say "pseudo-" worker placement because at no time during the game are you ever required to place a worker on your turn and at no time does a worker being on a space block that space from being used by other players.

The main "gimmick" of this game is that time is another resource you must manage and your workers (family members) die off as time passes.  I put "gimmick" in quotes because while it was the main selling point of the game that set it apart from countless other Euros its more than just a gimmick.  It is a mechanic that actually works quite well.  At different points of the game you may be trying to delay or even accelerate the deaths of your family members since the deaths of these meeples also sets the tempo of the game.  The game ends when a certain number of meeples have died and you get points based on where and when they died.  At the same time you don't want the game to end before you've collected enough victory points other ways as well.

The action spaces seem well balanced and there's always that feature of action-taking Euros where you want to do 5 things in a round and only get to do 4.  This is a pretty good entry into a crowded game space that does a couple nifty new things.

Very interesting mechanic. The spirit of a good game must always reflect the anguish of the gamer in deciding the best thing to do. A simple cube selection based on the color versus the action taken does it, almost in a perfect way. The downside here is that often the decision does not alter the spirit and the context of the game. But still is close enough to brilliancy/simplicity.

This seems to succeed in being a little quirky whilst also a by the numbers Euro. The quirky hook is the tempus fugit Meeple death - its  both a curse and a boon as your meeples die of after a certain amount of time has been spent on actions; it sort of rewards inefficiency (there is a time consuming and an efficient way to take actions) as you get points for dead meeples (so long as they died in office). Need to play it a few more times to cement rating and whether its a keeper or JASE

---------------

3 games in and death of meeples has become  just another mechanic, In fact irritating as it feels tacked on to another uninteresting mishandle mash of get stuff and spen it.

The every game seems to follow the same path so traded

Ugh. You can almost playbthis randomly and do well.

Played a first complete game, which confirmed my suspicions: this is the typical dry and soulless euro cube-pusher. It's just optimising and scraping points here and there. I don't mind a puzzle game now and then and although it's certainly not bad, it's beyond me why such a game is so tremendously popular.

I kinda enjoyed my first game, but I foresee utter boredom with subsequent plays.

******************

Played only a few rounds, so I'll withhold a rating for now.

First impression: this is another dry cube pusher, where it's all about optimization. Yet again, lots of ways to score points, but there seems to be no no overarching game mechanic or idea that ties it all together. Like many eurogame puzzle games of late, it seems to lack focus and creativity (despite some novel ideas).

I would certainly like to play again to find out more, but I'm in no rush to add this to my collection.

What a clever game!  Not quite a worker placement game, so much as an action selection game, each player is taking resource cubes off the board in order to place their workers and take action.  However, every action requires time, and as that time commodity runs out, the oldest generation of workers are taken from the board and either scored for points, or placed in a countdown timer to end the game.  There is a tension between wanting to keep your workers on the board to manufacture the resources you want, and wanting to place them in the scoring track.

Started out as another soulless themeless cube pushing euro, but I got into the gameplay and the theme as the game progressed.
Still this game lives on its family mechanic and while it's a great idea, it can't support the whole game.  At his core, it's still a ressource conversion game you've seen a hundred times before (and probably with the same lame medieval Germany theme).
After one game, I feel I've seen everything this game as to offer.

Despite the plethora of strategic options players can follow to earn victory points (hmmmm... shall I pack the city council with my partisans, or take an extended vacation in the countryside?), and the lovely mechanic where your meeples can -- and will -- die, this game wound up being not so enjoyable for me. Honestly, I think a lot of it was due to the physical fiddlyness of all those cubes and meeples, but also the it-takes-a-village theme didn't really resonate. Not saying it's a bad game, just not the right game for me.

RATING: 7
An excellent, smooth-playing, seemingly very well-balanced eurogame that epitomizes "multiple paths to victory". Unfortunately, like Hawaii, it's from the grab-bag school of game design: "elegant" is not the word. There are eight different things to do and none of them are quite alike; there are weird exceptions (you don't have to take the action with a cube, except for the market, where you do!). There is no theme.

Despite initially dismissing the game after reading the rules, I picked it up on the strength of the positive reviews. It really does play well, and I'd rate it higher if it had some exciting new mechanism at its heart (Macao's windrose, Trajan's mancala!).

Alas, while the dying meeples do add a little something, the time track is just another resource to calculate around -- it's less interesting than it sounds. The whole thing feels a bit soulless: solid but unexciting.

Good theme play.  Game fairly easy to learn, but will take a few plays to develop strategies.  Many, many different paths to choose.  The death of workers is an interesting mechanic.

Kind of a worker placement game with several new twists. First, an additional worker does not give you an extra action (like in Agricola for example).
Second, your workers are going to die at some point and that is not nearly as bad as it sounds.
In fact, letting your workers age (and eventually die) adds an additional dimension to your strategy.

I'm surprised to find myself so ambivalent about this game.  It's a good, solid game but it just doesn't grab me the way some others do.  Part of it may be that I've played so many similar games.  It's not really deriviative of anything, but neither is it unique enough to stand out from the crowd.  I'd like to play it at least a few more times, but I don't think it's going to make a lasting impression on me.

Novel new mechanic of 'aging' but in its heart it remains a soulless euro. Mesh some 'generic' mechanisms together (worker selection + a random walk area. Oh and a market! yeah..), add one 'new' mechanism doesn't make it fresh.

Village is thematic for a Euro. About as thematic as Stone Age is. So, in other words, the things you do make sense as to why you do them. Setup is easy and it looks great.  It has lots of ways to make points. Yet, it has the agony of not enough actions to do everything you want. So you need to concentrate on a strategy at some point. It's forgiving but you need a little focus. That's why I like it so far. It has some exploration to do in the strategy. So far our games have us finding a different path to go on. It doesn't have a lot of soul but it's fun and looks good. Time will tell if it has legs.  

update : Each play makes me like it a little bit more.  The scoring in each game can be radically different depending on the paths players choose.  The ending is a little bit of a fizzle.  Count up points and see who did better.  There is not much of a story arc here.  Still, for a quick contest (between 2 anyways) it does a good job.  I like it with 2 quite a bit but 3 players feels more tense.

I'm not quite sure what to make of it just yet. It seemed a lot like the 3 main ways of scoring (travelling, the church, the council chamber) are equally balanced and so it comes down to who does best on the other areas. This didn't feel overly new, as though I'd seen it all before.

Update: On a second play, I can see the joy of this game. It's not that each route is balanced, it is how well you combine the takings of cubes to excel at the route(s) you elect to take.

Further update: All of our games have descended in to group think with people rushing to kill people off and end the game quickly which basically makes the travelling option worthless and undermines the market trading tactics. This has really sapped my desire to play it.

Updated from 6.8 to 7.4 and then down to 6.

Very interesting action selection mechanism! When you select an action to take, you take a cube from that place (if there are any left) and you do the action, but you also get the cube. Many times you need a cube of a certain color, but there is no guarantee you want to take an action where all those cubes are placed.

The aging aspect of the game also feels fresh and interesting. You actually want your meeples to die, so you can get points from them. Fresh ideas combined in a nice game that works. This is NOT a game where designers just put in as many mechanisms as they could to make it seem complex, this is a good one.

RATING: 6
Village is a pleasant, medium-weight worker-placement game. The villager death mechanic, which both requires and also encourages you to kill off some of your workers, is clever. It opens up a new path to victory points, and introduces a timing mechanic that is more thematic than any other worker placement game I've played (such as Tzolk'in). In the end, Village is still a resource collection and conversion game. The most efficient player will win. Player interaction comes in the form of denying other players actions, which is fine. Like most games of this type, however, I feel as though I will be heading down one of a few different paths each time I play with little room for variety. The different "stations" are more thematically integrated than in many other games I have played, and yet still feel disjointed (and even a bit fiddly). This is a function of the worker-placement genre more than anything else -- and so it is to be expected. Again, this is a clever game in the genre. It's simply not a genre I am overly enamored with.

Love the gimmick of the dying meeples, which probably is the most fun mechanic of the game that spices up what would otherwise be a generic (but yet still pretty good) worker placement game (ok, yes, sometimes you aren't even placing workers, but it has the same vibe). Being able to choose not only which action but how you go about that action, and essentially 'investing' in said action for future turns, is really interesting and fun.

So Euro...it's scary.

Something about the theme feels almost too thin. Gameplay is there...but the theme...just...ugh.

THEME ISSUES ASIDE - Got to play this once against Jason and once against the girlfriend.  First time Jason and I were kind of...eh? However we missed a few things.  Now that I had a second chance to play and against the girlfriend a lot of the parts make sense (Jason and I misunderstood how the Well worked and never used it. Tiffany and I figured it out at the last minute)

Another game that had the girlfriend effect-  after playing against her my feelings on it have changed and again for the good.  I want to now try this with both of them and maybe one more.

I'm enjoying this one in the early going. The only downside here is that if nobody decides to push the pace and spend time instead of resources, the four-player game can drag a bit. But with players who are familiar with the game, things shouldn't bog down, despite the many choices, as a turn simply consists of taking a cube and doing (or not doing) the associated action. There seems to be some depth here, and so far it looks like being a generalist - doing a little bit of everything - is just as effective as being a specialist - picking one method of scoring points and just pounding away at that area. I like that kind of game balance. Scores also seem to be competitive even when players use wildly divergent strategies. Some decisions are easy, but when the choice is between taking a useful resources from an area where you cannot perform the associated action or taking a bad black cube in an area where you can do the action, I'm still not sure which is better. I guess hard choices with no easy answers is part of why the game is interesting. I'm also happy to report that, while the game plays best with four, it works well as a two-player game, ensuring it will see some table time in-between meetings of my game group.

Triggering the market is just too valuable an option - and a very scarce one at that. In any other section of the board players can mostly advance and earn points independendently fromthe other players. By having just one action in the market and the market not being restocked until the preceding round, the market lets you decide at what moment which resources are needed and if or what your coplayers can or cannot score. That's plain invaluable. Other than that it feels very solitaire,but this is a trait it has in common with most other worker placement games. The aging and dying adds a nice touch, but it doesn't awe me like it did in "Kremlin" or in "In the shadow of the emperor".

Enjoyable Eurogame... Explaining it to new players is a bit of a cluster eff because the mechanics are so scattered, but the rules and mechanics are numerous more than complex... It all fits in eight the games core virtue, an impressively diverse scoring system that leaves you in the dark about who is the victor till everyone counts up points in the endgame. There are so many point sources and strategies to take, you can try for victory from almost any direction, the only obvious mistake is competing with another player too fiercely over one source of points compared to finding one neglected. The death and generations mechanic is particularly original and fun. A fine game, all in all.

A solid euro with a very clever twist on worker placement where the oldest meeples kick the bucket. If you time a meeple's death well, it can result in meeple prestige (otherwise known, of course, as victory points). I'm not sure, but my initial impression is that the market action is overpowered.

Village isn't the prettiest game on the shelf, but it offers some very unique puzzles for a lighter Euro.

The method of limiting action uses by drawing colored cubes, and having the block cubes make you lose 'time' is really creative. Planning when to dispatch your workers, knowing you'll have to sacrifice them to Father Time, also leads to some fun, difficult decisions.

First Impression:

A decent euro.

I really had great expectations about this one. A medium euro with a strong unique appeal-to-all theme that won the spiel des jahres? Wow, it must be something! Well, not exactly but it is working flawlesly, flows well and has multiple strategies to explore. The mechanism of death(!) can create some special comments unique in the euro genre.

The well advertised theme is still pasted on, the mechanics are great but rather arbitary and overall the game plays as blandly as stereotypical euros.

Well it's an ok game and that's it. I'm slightly dissapointed. I have no problem playing but little desire as well.

I would have been happier if there were more benefit in keeping your people alive but there's a real draw to letting them get killed off. Perhaps too much of a draw. Going to have to explore this but really if it comes down to that I'll be forced to lower the rating. 

I got a 2 player game of this in and it's just awful. No tension at all in this game with only 2 players. Blech. I adore this game and tries to work as a 2 player the best it can with reducing the number of cubes coming out. Still you can see what colors are there and decide what you want to do on your next 5 turns and with little trouble get it done. With 4 players...some bastard is bound to take the cube you really need and that's just down right FUNstrating.

Fun and fairly fast for a low-luck resource management game.

The graphics are perhaps a bit bland to my taste, but the game seemed a hit with my group and everybody found it straightforward even though the rules took 20+ minutes to explain.

Can't figure out how replayable it is, but look forward to exploring the strategies a bit more for now...

Excellent worker placement game. Very refreshing mechanisms about how your people die and what happens to them when they die. You have to plan for the death of each of your people. The whole game is an excellent and intricate decision puzzle. There are many and different ways to get victory points. This is a very intuitive game after you play the first round. Probably the best game of 2012. Better than Eclipse, although the two cannot be compared.

Resource management/Worker placement game with a nice and well integrated theme. and a twist: you can spend 'time' to make some actions but your workers will get older and eventually die!. I love how you can manage the 'time' to control the endgame. Easy to learn, low luck and deep gameplay. I love how you can specialize in some actions, which drive to several paths to win. Nice balance between strategic thinking (you can plan some turns ahead) and interactive/tactical play. Very good playtime for me (60-90min including setup and clean), well balanced, and the most important for us: It works great for 2 players. IMHO Village is one of the best midweight euros ever designed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.3
A 'reverse worker placement' game in which you take cubes to place workers, rather than placing workers to take cubes (as in Lords of Waterdeep). While the cubes are not as critical as they are in LoW - the actions are more important - the selection of available cubes can affect your choices. I love the aging mechanic, in which actions cost 'time' and eventually result in the death of your workers that have been in play the longest. The location of your meeples and the timing of their deaths can be very important. I very much prefer this to LoW.

I bought the "bonus customers" from BGG then realized they were included in my edition of the base game. Whoops!

Other players opinions varied and might have had an impact on my opinion after a first play. Yes, it is a little dry. I think the theme works great and I wasn't bored to tears as one player expressed. I kind of liked the fact that it was kind of (unexpectedly) short! I wouldn't like Village if it played much longer. I kind of like it.

Life in the village is hard – but life here also allows the inhabitants to grow and prosper as they please. One villager might want to become a friar. Another might feel ambitious and strive for a career in public office. A third one might want to seek his luck in distant lands.

Each player will take the reins of a family and have them find fame and glory in many different ways. There is one thing you must not forget, however: Time will not stop for anyone and with time people will vanish. Those who will find themselves immortalized in the village chronicles will bring honor to their family and be one step closer to victory.

Village is a game full of tactical challenges. A smart and unique new action mechanism is responsible for keeping turns short and yet still tactically rich and full of difficult decisions. Also unique is the way this game deals with the delicate subject of death; as a natural and perpetual part of life in the village, thoughts of death will keep you focused on smart time-management.

Este juego me ha decepcionado un poco. Esta bien pero no llega a divertirme del todo. No me gusta el tema de coger cubos para realizar acciones ni que vayan muriendo los personajes.

This game is a worthy winner of Kennerspiel 2012. While in many ways, Village is a standard Euro-inspired game with various well-worn and timeless mechanics, the coupling of the time-track "death" mechanic with worker placement is relatively innovative. The board is crowded, but well-laid out and informative. The graphics and illustrations are also pleasing to the eye. 

Like many other complex Eurogames in this genre, players are presented with multiple paths to victory. Each path forces the player to expand limited resources to reach longer term, end-game goals (collecting prestige points in this instance). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice elements in the game. I especially enjoyed the "take a cube, make an action mechanic". Also, theme was more stronger than in most modern games, which is a big plus. 

However, I would have liked the game to be a bit more compact. It is pretty long and there are many different aspects to the game - perhaps few too many for my personal euro-game resource management niche. I can see the first few games people are exploring the choices, but after that the game could start to feel samey. Personally i prefer games that push you to different directions and force you to explore new strategies - village does not do it too much. 

Oh yeah, and the seeding of the cubes and placing stickers really are quite fiddly and irritating things to do.

A nice little game. I'm wondering if Inn will expand the experience to a very solid spot, but unsure of pulling the trigger. Feels like it's almost there, but its hard for me to work the urge to play this over something else. 

The death mechanic and chronicle can lead to some interesting choices on where to place your family members. It can lead to some varied scenarios also where the game ends absurdly fast or drags on longer than it should.

Provisional rating, one play.  Yet another twist on the tired worker-placement mechanism, and a good one.  The type and number of actions available in round are limited and common to all players. Though the benefit of most actions is dependent on an assigned worker, the action isn't exclusive i.e. multiple players can get the same benefit in a round (removing my major frustration with many wp games). Workers are typically assigned permanently to an action, though in many cases the player can alter the benefit received, though some "die" during the game, potentially being converted to victory points.  Action points are a currency in the game (actually several currencies, as it's paid in cubes of different colours), as is Time; Time is the game clock.  It's pretty, too.

Solid worker placement game with some very interesting twists

[+] I like the time management and the workers dying over time, the different jobs worker can get offer interesting choices (although I never felt I had too few workers), you don't have to do a bit of eveything to win (better to focus on a few things done well)
[-] very abstracted "action cube" that becomes resources, end of the game feels too abrupt (usually lots of unfinished business), point salad at the end is not very exciting

This one's another heavy Euro, and it doesn't even bother with any theme.  Where?  A village, of course!  When?  Medieval-y or sometime.  There's a little bit of Pillars of the Earth (the book, not the game) glorification of the common man, but mostly this is all about keeping the VP engine well-oiled.  In a genre that is getting increasingly crowded, both mechanically and thematically, there's not a lot about Village to make it stand out.  It's good, I suppose, but it's destined to be forgotten on the shelf in favor of the more interesting games out there.

RATING: 8
Select a cube off the board, which then grants you a specific action. So, sometimes you're grabbing the action because you want the cube, and other times you want the action and don't care about the cube too much. Workers age and die, which makes for difficult decisions on which actions to take, as it causes your older workers to drop off. Lots of decisions in a short time.

RATING: 6.5
UPDATE: Got boring after five consecutive plays. It's got a delightful theme, gorgeous graphic design, but it feels like pushing cubes around a spreadsheet. There's no grand narrative - you're not building a city or civilisation, improving your port, fighting a war or storytelling. You're filling a book with dead people while scoring victory points until an arbitrary end point. 

The Village Inn expansion adds new varied ways to fill a book with dead people until an arbitrary end point (you can have people die in the pub and bribe citizens with beer. Citizens are cards that give you points for stuff, or assorted actions).

In short, a mediocre euro with a cute theme.

*****

Based on one play, this is Trajan with a delightful family-generations theme and cube selection/time instead of a mancala. Since Trajan would benefit from more closely integrated mechanics, theme, and action selection other than the much-lauded-but-gets-old-quick mancala, it's a good game for non-grognards.

Needs more plays before I can tell if gets boring/broken. I understand why it won the Kennerspiel. The theme makes what would be a VP salad game a genuinely charming and accessible experience.

This is a neat little worker placement game that doesn't play like a lot of the others that are already in the market.  I like the idea of there being no competition on the sites themselves, but instead with it coming from how many times a particular action can be taken.  Plus, the time element of your workers adds a measure of thinking to an already complex game, as you want to manage when you use a worker before it dies.  The usefulness of the different colors of cubes adds a layer of strategy to manage (though the publisher's choice of colors is colorblind-aggressive), and it all ties in neatly into a challenging set of rules.  The game feels like an abstract (that is, you'll probably feel like you're pushing cubes around a board than you will that you're living in a village), but it all works in a nice way.  There's a lot of decision-making and thinking to do throughout the game.

Really enjoy this game so far and the way it feels like it packs such a big amount of game into a relatively short playing time. Also great components and art work. Although there are a lot of different routes to victory I am concerned that once you start with one you really need to focus on that and play it out accordingly with little variation in the execution or surprises. More replays will tell.

Played again after a reasonably long hiatus. Really enjoyed it and has reinvigorated my interest in this one. Will probably pick up an expansion when I get the chance.

Village Inn expansion has boosted this rating massively. The variation provided by that and the way it guides your strategy a little has put this as one I'm most excited to play.

RATING: 6
Village made a big splash when it was first released due to its unique "death" mechanism, a feature that limited the amount of actions your meeples could take before passing on and being removed from the game. That's certainly an interesting twist, but to be perfectly honest, it's about the only interesting thing going on in this game.

It's labeled as a worker placement game, but really, Village is more of a set collection game. Your workers are more of an expendable resource for generating goods than markers for blocking opponents, and often you will take actions at various spots on the board without having to place a worker at all. Many times you end up grabbing certain color combinations of cubes as your primary motivation, with their associated actions only being resolved as a weak afterthought.

The thematic integration with the game is poor as well. The idea of a village slowly growing through the hard work and dedication of its people across multiple generations simply doesn't shine through the game's fairly standard cube pushing. The market isn't very dynamic, the farms produce with little effort and traveling is accomplished simply by spending a random assortment of cubes, with little rhyme or reason for the color requirements. Also, the whole death gimmick is more of a timer for the game than a hurdle for the players. It's easily manipulated, and as the main selling point for the game, I found it to be quite a letdown.

I'm surprised Tom Vasel didn't set this on fire when he reviewed it.

Obviously I didn't love it, but I will play it again. Now that I have thrown away any expectations of an engrossing story arc, I'm pretty sure there is an interesting abstract here. Somewhere.

Superb worker placement game with a dynamic time and resource element added in. The game is straight forward rules-wise, easy to comprehend (but requiring deep thought to make optimal choices) coupled with very low downtime. To place your worker you must think in multiple levels: what would I like my worker to do, what resource will he collect and where will he end up when he dies of old age. Highly recommended!

[i]Rating with the Inn and Port expansions added to the base game (7/10 without the expansions)[/i].

A lovely medium-weight euro. Village has a very "organic" feel to it - actions taken by players tell a story, which is very unusual for a "cube pushing euro" like that.  The base game lacks a bit of variety, but it's all fixed by the expansions - Village gets much better with both Inn and Port added, they really elevate the whole game to another level. 

The only downside is that when players decide to "save time" at all costs the game may drag.

[i]I own the Inn expansion.[/i]

Looks lovely. Mechanics are quite simple but need to think about how best to maximise the use of resources. I like it because there are many ways to collect points and therefore diff ways to win. Also it will be diff each game because of the random resource allocation.

After another play I may rerate it a 10.

RATING: 7
Played final pre-production copy at BGG.Con.  Quite good - racing to get your people to die is a novel mechanic.  It might be a little too cube pushy for some people, and I also wonder if there is a lot of replayability in the game or if it will prove to have one or two dominant scoring mechanics built around the novel dead villager idea.

After a second play with nicer bits, I moved this one up a notch.  With 4 players, we all took different scoring tracks, and the game ended up very close.  So, I think there is a real game here.

RATING: 6
A good game--good enough that I mistakenly sold Caylus thinking Village would replace it as my worker-placement of choice--but ultimately thematic incoherence ruined it for me.  From the meaninglessly coloured cube collection, to the use of time as nothing more than another resource--one that ran at different speeds for different players--it simply stopped working for me.  Yes, the story of uncle Bob the farmer who never left home and died without achieving anything, yet earned pride of place in the Village annals is funny (once), but not fodder for strong thematic playing.

RATING: 6.8
Village is one of those many well built games that failed to make me enthusiast. I don't know exactly why. There are some original and interesting mechanics but the game is one of those usual "get cube, transform cubes in PV's" and so on. Not a problem in itself, of course, but you need a good deal of innovation now to reach a good game quality within this framework. Anyways, Village works well, its rhytm is fast enough and the game isn't overly long. It's just a bit to fragmented... things are interraleted but they don't feel connected: take a cube there, use it here, what's the cube? just a color. I know, all games just have cubes, but, for example, i can feel what i am doing in Hansa Teutonica, everything is connected... here, i couldn't find the real connection among actions, i couldnt find a way to an organic strategy.

Maybe one or two more games will raise the rating. So far, Village is a good but disappointing game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Mundane action drafting which offers sparse rewards besides vanilla victory point bonuses. The only useful priviledges are held through leaving workers in a crafts location. Despite the dramatic time track mechanism fuelling worker 'burials' the Village offers little more than repetitive resource collection with no arc to ramp into. The expansion may improve the bland base game. I found the dice rolling spin-off game 'My Village' provided more light entertainment than it's predecessor based on exploring similar themes.

Even though its classified as worker placement, the mechanics in this one are unlike anything else I've played. A lot of fun, once you get the rules down. Also nice that it works well with 2 players, without any extra 2-player rules like most games have. 
Village is a game full of tactical challenges. A smart and unique new action mechanism is responsible for keeping turns short and yet still tactically rich and full of difficult decisions. Also unique is the way this game deals with the delicate subject of death; as a natural and perpetual part of life in the village, thoughts of death will keep you focused on smart time-management.

We toil in the village to improve the lives our family for future generations to come.  Improve our knowledge and skill to advance in our professions or devote ourselves to faith. First game that I know of that uses time as a measure of player actions and incorporates meeple death in our family legacy while still planning for the future. Wow.

Functionally a worker placement game (pick up cubes from locations to take actions). Train up your meeples to make certain actions more rewarding and breed new generations of meeples as your older meeples start to die off.  The gameplay is rewarding and the theme engaging.  The only flaw is the cubes themselves, which are abstract and hard to tie into the theme.

I dislike [i]Village[/i] for the same reason that I dislike [i]Troyes[/i].  You pick a VP strategy, then focus on that strategy to the exclusion of pretty much everything else.   Though "strategy" is probably a misnomer in this context.  Repeating the same interrelated VP actions makes me an automaton, not a strategic player.

If the game could manage an end-game twist along the lines of M. Night Shyamalan's [url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368447/]The Village[/url], that would be awesome.  Like we were all collecting cubes and VPs, only to find out that the cubes were bone saws and the VPs were human hearts. Wouldn't that be something.

Juego con mecánica de colocación de trabajadores. Dirigiremos a una familia que vive en una Villa y competiremos con otras familias para ver cual de ellas es la que al final de la partida cuenta con más prestigio en el municipio. Lo curioso de este juego es que nuestros familiares van muriendo, no están disponibles toda la partida. De nuestra actuación depende que acaben en el cementerio común (algo que ni da ni quita puntos) o en el libro de crónicas del municipio, donde acaban los paisanos del pueblo que más notoriedad adquirieron.

RATING: 5
Based on one play:

The game has some nice innovative ideas, but overall I found it very overwhelming without offering much excitement. There was a lot to keep track of, especially the different point requirements. There are lots of different cubes and animals and items and resources and they're all used in specific ways all around the board. It's a slow, continuous struggle for points. But then again, it was my first game, so I had absolutely no idea what the best moves were. 

I ended up going for a combined market/church strategy, ignoring the harbor (we played with the harbor expansion) entirely. I was also a little annoyed at how difficult it was to get gold, which you would need for a captain to use the harbor in the first place, which is why I never went for that in the end.

Overall, I am not feeling it with this one here, as much as I love the mechanism of time as a resource and having your workers die.

Village is a euro game that is full of theme.  For a worker placement game, that is an exciting aspect.  The fact that your workers can "die" and that in many cases, you want them to die leads to direct strategic and tactical choices.  I love the blend of strategy vs. tactics in this game.  Do you go to the market to ensure you buy what you want and to block people out of buying before they get the resources they need?  Or do you take that extra worker you need?  This does feel like a game that you need to specialize in something to maximize your score.  However, no one strategy is noticeably better than another.  If you enjoy worker placement games, this one feels unique and you should add it to your collection!

8 after 1 play.

Main mechanic is rather refreshing, incorporating the themes of time and death. The scoring categories are however, too disparate and lacks a cohesive feel. The cubes representing the various values are also rather pasted on and themeless.

The title of the game should probably be changed to something that invokes feelings regarding family traditions instead; I thought the current name does not fit the theme and mechanic.

I love this game... randomly seeding the resources into the action spaces makes each round's action valuation a bit different each time, which makes each game flow a bit differently... you must try and get points in all areas and lead in points in at least one area to win... love the flow of the game, timing new workers, actions and dying workers together is everything... can't wait for expansions to increase the options even further!

Hard to really call this one a "worker placement" game... though I suppose the limited actions in the various spaces amount to about the same thing.  Certainly a very good resource conversion game with a unique time tracking and meeple dying (often for your benefit!) mechanic.  Despite the cube pushing feeling devoid of theme... the rest of the game just drips it so a net result of a very nice middleweight Euro that tells a decent story too. As I play the game more I'm finding the different paths to victory to be balanced and interesting to explore.

Sort of a reverse worker-placement game (although there is a small amount of real worker-placement too).  Instead of placing a meeple on the action you want, you remove a resource cube from it; once all the cubes are gone, the round ends.

I was a little disappointed how minor the family death theme turned out to be; based on what I'd heard I thought it would be bigger.  Cooler.  Still a good game, it just didn't quite live up to my expectations.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Your first move, you just have no idea where to start.  Thereafter, you have plenty of options, but you have collapsed the possibilities enough that the microturns of the game zip along.  Myriad choices, a singular feel, and control over how fast the game ends.  What's not to like?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
For someone who can be intimidated by a true-to-life, hours-long Eurogame, I find Village to be a refreshing take on the worker placement game. There's a LOT that you can make your workers do, but there's not enough to be overwhelming. I also think that the death mechanic for your workers makes things all the more refreshing - for instance, do you keep your worker outside of town to score more VPs, or do you let the worker die to help towards major end-of-game VPs in the history book? I like Village, and so should you.

A game devoid of any 'wow' factor whatsoever. It wasn't a *bad* game per se, just it lacked originality, excitement, and dare I say it, fun. It really was a game where you buy cubes to do something else to get points, where you send your workers off to be politians or clergy or to travel, and just hope they don't die to mis-management of time.

Bit of a snooze-fest tbh

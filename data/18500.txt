Did not enjoy this much. The theme is excellent and evocative, and the art and pieces are beautiful.
Unfortunately the game is a little overcomplicated (the personal decks in particular) and the downtime is atrocious. It took over 2 hours to play our 4 player game, and that was only about 7 turns.

I would play it again, but with 2 or 3 players.

This game has mechanics which I havent seen before yet. Simple but at the same time demanding. Its probably best with 2 players but also plays well with 3 players.
You have to figure out quite a lot of different strategies in moving and rotating all the different tiles.

A helluva heavy game.  Very AP-heavy and much downtime.  You can't really plan your move until your turn starts.  This creates a long game.  Great ideas in this...almost seems like a concept ahead of its time.

Traded away.

RATING: 6
The title of the game is a word square in which the same words appear on columns and rows, backwards and forwards.  That 'its the same thing viewed from any direction' is very appropriate for the game as well.  It can look like its all twisted and chaotic, but it is essentially a race game that requires some movement planning.  It is not nearly as deep as the image of the board's bottomless pit implies, but it does have some depth to manipulate and try to contort to bring out more strategy.  I'm not entirely convinced that taking the time to delve into it ill yield much better results than just a tactical approach would.  Would be great as a medium filler if it played a tad faster.

Very original game idea which works surprisingly well. There are so many ways to manipulate the maze that you always are able to surprise you fellow players. Unfortunately they surprise you too. As wel as being a plus the sheer infinite number of moves causes a lot of downtime in the game. Not only is the game prone to the worst form of analysis paralysis there is also no sense in thinking about your turn before it actually is your turn. So much changes after every move. Can become chaotic real fast.

I love the strange theme and production value in this game.  There's something super creepy about all the Latin.  I find the moving bridges and books a very cool and different gameplay. Not really for everyone, but high on my list of keepers.  My sister-in-law, a connoisseur or Latin, needs to play this one!  Two downsides: 1) The provided player aid is indecipherable to new players and 2) significant analysis paralysis potential.

For all the thematic window dressing this is on the abstract side and probably a mite too far in that direction for my liking, though player interaction leavens that with a healthy dose of chaos - at least that's how it felt.  Not all bad though by any means.

Played for first time at BGG.Con.  The idea is intriguing but the play is a little too random.  At least in a 4 player game there is absolutely no ability to plan your move ahead of time because the board will be completely different to then.  Also, it is prone to king-maker issues.

RATING: 5.75
Move around to collect 4 books. Reminds me of games like Sunken City, die Magier von Pangea. And the problem with games like that is it comes down to "Do I try to win? Or stop someone else from winning?"
This game is purposely chaotic, so it's mostly a waste of time to plan anything out until your move. Because it's a game where you'll want to get every bit of value per card, it's understandable when someone takes a few minutes to make a move. So beware of DOWNTIME!

Production is great.

RATING: 7
A light game made medium by iconographic values. Also, the game needs a better way to ensure a more balanced placement of the books before the game starts, although I think that clever path placement can offset this to some extent (place tiles so that your books can rotate to the center, others to rotate other's books to the outer edges). Could just as easily have had a Harry Potter Hogwart's theme, as the moving pathways sure feel like the central stairway in those books.

After 2 plays of this game I'm definitely pleased with this.  It did seem to play a bit better with 2 people rather than 3 due to downtime between turns, but this was with a new player, and 2 of us playing for only the second time.  There are a couple of fiddly rules that made the initial explanations trickier from a teaching perspective, and there were a few minor details that I feel should have been added to the rulebook. However, I did a better job explaining things the second time around as I knew what to focus on, and what could be ignored and/or explained later.  Once you get past these minor difficulties, the essential gameplay is actually fairly simple to understand and intuitive, but also tricky and intriguing. The visual appeal of the game is great too.

It's kind of usual with most games, but expect a bit longer than usual on the first play of this one.

Things really seemed to snap into place after a couple turns, but that first turn really has you sitting around wondering how it's all going to play out and what moves you can, should, and shouldn't do.

The game can definitely get chaotic as it the walkways grind into place, change position, and ~ worst of all ~ disappear.

Very fun game.   Had the eldest chanting in Latin, the daughter with a cowl and a psuedo-rosary, and the youngest wanting to sic gargoyles on everyone.

Fairly good game of manouevring walkways around the board and collecting 4 books in your colour. Fairly simple choices, and a lot of screwage. Yes, it's an Italian design, and they seem to like the mix of German simplicity in design, and American screwage in gameplay. I liked it but it's a touch aggressive and the gameplay is slightly imbalanced. Original ideas though.

RATING: 5
The board in SATOR consists entirely of moving parts, and you need to use your action points, cards, and geometrical finesse to reach certain spaces on the board to collect books.

The game is primarily a big and fairly engaging puzzle. You need to use your resources to either move yourself closer to your books or your books closer to yourself by moving and/or rotating the moving parts. The closer you get to the end, though, it increasingly becomes a game of playing against your opponents instead of for yourself, an element I usually strongly dislike. In multiplayer games, bashing the perceived leader is also a fairly natural occurence. Both of these make sure that the puzzle element retreats to the background in the endgame and make the result feel rather arbitrary.

Probably much better with two players only.

After one play, 3 players. I liked it, mainly the puzzle aspect. On the pure gaming side, I feel like the first player might have a signifiant advantage, and I'm not sure how much luck influences the results (probably a lot). It's still a fun and quick enough game, if you're into these sorts of little spatial reasoning problems.

Kooky name, kooky game. It's certainly unique. Move and rotate the shifting bridge tiles and get your guy to the the four books scattered all over the board. Your plans will constantly be interfered with by the other players, and theirs will constantly be interfered with by you. The possibilities for screwage are many but at least it's manageable since everyone has one copy of each of the most powerful cards. I thought that was a nice way to reduce the luck of the draw. Good play is about effective card use, not effective card drawing.

Rated after one 4-player game.  Very clever spacial reasoning game.  You have to be flexible as your perfect plans will almost not be there when you turn comes around (especially with 4).  There is definately room for nice combos if you have the right cards.  Looking forward to playing again.

Kind of Torres-like, but I don't like it as much as Torres.  A little more opportunity for take-that, which makes it more of a political game (you should attack him instead of me because....)  Based on playing with three; perhaps it's better with four.  Update: Playing again some time later, the take-that was more pronounced.  I got out to an early lead and my opponents ganged up on me.  I was farthest from the lead when one of them won.  Downgraded.

The theme on this sounds kind of dark, but it doesn't really show up in the game play. This was a really fun puzzle game in which cards give different ways to move the platforms. You try to make the most efficient psth to collect the four books while occassionally blocking your neighbors.

RATING: 5
Somehow Sator sounded very interesting. The more I was disappointed by the odd mix of puzzle and screwage elements with a non-negligible degree of randomness. Each move confronts the player with a new complicated puzzle how to make the best out of his 6 cards and his additional free move. The puzzle is interesting enough that other players will chime in with suggestions how to best solve it. So far Sator met my expectations. But my desire to play again is ruined mostly by cards that allow to target other players directly which reduce the game in multiplayer mode to an uninspiring battle of who manages to sneak in the win by succesfully dashing for the last book when competitors have exhausted their target cards on other players or simply haven't been as lucky with getting the right cards as the winning player.

A nice enough game.  It reminded me of Roborally, except you get to bend the course and objectives location to your will.

Ultimately this isn't my taste in games.  The game is figuring out your route.  This means bouts of cogitating how to lay your route with the cards you have.

If you like Roborally or the Dragons of the Mekong, you may like this game.

In a way you could describe it as The aMAZEing Labyrinth for adults, but the action point system made it feel a lot like the Kiesling & Kramer Mask games mixed with some Tetris. Somewhat dry with 2, more chaotic but more fun with more, and occasionally very brainburning. And pretty good for what it is, though the need for constant calculations might slow it down if everyone isn't paying attention.
Downgraded a bit as entirely tactical games seldom do it for me. With a group that doesn't take it too seriously and the AP doesn't get too bad it can be fun, for once the chrome and "theme" actually give some feeling to an abstract game.

RATING: 7
This is an interesting puzzle game that feels a bit like a mix of Amazing Labyrinth and Torres with the special action cards.  It is basically a race game which requires the ability to see spatial connections.  There is luck of the draw involved and the game is largely tactical as the board can change a good bit from turn to turn.  Basically you can move pieces and rotate pieces or swap cards until you spend 6 action points.  I think the setup phase of the game can play a large role in determining the victor if you place your bridges well and no one interferes with you.  However, this game is not for the faint of heart since it does give people the opportunity to really mess with your best laid plans.  It is one of those games where you should never count on the board being set up the way you desire by the time it comes back around to your turn.

The hand size of your cards and the decisions left to you on how to manage your hand are large enough to force some decent thought, does not feel constricting, and light enough to not burn.

Very nice. The art keeps the game from feeling too dry, you can make some really satisfying moves by finding just the right combination of moves and rotations, and there is the possibility for some light screwage. It also plays pretty quick for a puzzle game - my games have lasted only 45-60 minutes so far.

Interesting theme of moving Acolytes over twisting paths that float above a pit to collect books of knowledge.  I usually don't like games that are too spatial but even though the layout changed frequently it didn't burn my mind the way Dungeon Twister did.  

Not my favourite type of game but certainly something I would play again.  Enjoyed the hand-management aspect and special powers.

wasn't as exciting as i expected it to be, and the rules are a bit confusing. i think it took as long to set up the board initially as it did for someone to win. there wasn't as much conflict as i had hoped there would be (e.g. robo rally robots crashing into each other), and with the amount of actions you get in a turn you can get a lot done at once.

Extremely clever idea. I enjoy figuring out the moves and rotations - but it takes time to find optimal moves even for non AP type players, so it is impossible to play this well without taking a long time for each player each turn. Therefore, it takes way too long between turns and unfortunately the board changes so much, that it is impossible to think ahead out of turn. So you might as well go away from the table for quite a while, which made this game very unattractive for me.

Mi aspettavo un gioco completamente diverso, che ci troviamo in una biblioteca non lo si avverte, e il gioco di parole del titolo non aiuta ad ambientarlo, detto questo il gioco risulta comunque molto interessante e tattico anche se la pesca delle carte rende il tutto abbastanza soggetto alla fortuna. Il gioco rischia una fortissima paralisi da analisi e a mio avviso è quasi meglio gicoato in 2 che non in 4.

[i]Meet some fun folks at TotalCon (Brian and Dan) and after teaching them one of my favorites ([thing=129948][/thing]) Brian taught brought this game out. You begin the game by placing Tetris shaped pieces to build pathways on the board in order to collect books that are scattered about. Sounds easy, except the whole game is screwing over everyone else by moving the paths they need away from them while also trying to position the pathways you need into position. You can move pieces orthogonality or rotate them on any axis.

You are drawing cards which give you different abilities and each player also has their own deck cards that are even more powerful (but they can only be used once per game). 

This was a really fun game, the take that wasn't really mean and half the time what you thought was really going to screw someone over ends up helping them out. I would recommend you check this one out, I was glad to play a game I never heard of before.[/i]

Based on one play: Move your wizard around to collect the books, but you need cards to move around the paths in order to get there, while others do the same. It is enjoyable, but repetitive and when you are ahead, others will just move the paths away to annoy you.

Fun puzzle game, it took only a few turns to get the hang of the game, so pretty easy to learn. 

Downside is that rotating pieces with stuff on them is very annoying, especially if it has to be turned back as well. And there can be really big changes to the layout of the board, which means that you have to rethink your plans, which leads to some AP every now and then.

Perhaps one one of the biggest surprises for me this year. At first, I expected this to be a more boring version of Wiz-War, but it turns out it eliminates a lot of the chaos and randomness and creates a very tight race to collect the objectives. Players have just the right amount of interaction, rotating, moving and sometimes even destroying tiles. It can be hard to judge who is going to win, mostly because a player may be saving a special Liber Fidei card to jump across the board suddenly. Half of the fun is anticipating those kind of moves and preparing the board accordingly. I can only see this getting better with experience.

A risky combination of 'screw your neighbour' and high puzzle factor, requiring you to carefully calculate how you want the levitating walkways to move and where to position yourself on them in order to travel most efficiently. High luck element, it's a game where you think one turn at a time as virtually no planning can be made for the future, but it's still me who usually wins. Not a great game, but I like it - partly because of the cool theme and pleasant looking board and elements, partly because considerable thinking is still involved, and partly because it's relatively simple and I can play it with non-gamers (who can gang up on me). Best try before you buy.

Remek ötlet a játék témája, egy kicsit a rózsa nevéből a könyvtár jutott eszembe róla játék közben. A komponensek nagyon szépek, az egésznek van egy kis sötét hangulata ami remekül illik a játékhoz. A játékmenet is elfogadható, könnyen beragadhat 1-1 hosszabban gondolkodó ember miatt (mint néha velem) és nem is érdemes előre tervezni, mert a pálya biztos, hogy jelentősen változik 1-1 játékos körében. Ötletes a setup rész, ahogy a könyvek felkerülnek, jól összerakott játék. Kell egy kis térlátás is hozzá. A hossza is megfelelő, 1 óra alatt bőven lemegy még 4 személynél is (szabálymagyarázat nélkül). A pont még biztosan fog változni, ismerkednünk kell még.

Nagyon jó kis logikai, taktikai játék. A játékosok akolitákat (köpönyeges alakok) személyesítenek meg, akik megpróbálják a négy Elveszett Könyvet megtalálni. Minden játékosnak van saját négy könyve, amelyek a Bűnösök verme fölötti lebegő pallókon érhetőek el. Ezek a pallók különböző kártyák segítségével mozgathatók, forgathatók. Ezen felül minden akolita 8 egyedi kártyák kap, amelyek még nagyobb tudású dolgokat írnak le, de csak egyszer használatosak. A játékosok megpróbálják saját köteteiket a többiek előtt megszerezni, illetve a többieket hátráltatni a pallók mozgatásával. Előre tervezni nem igazán lehet, mert úgy is változik a játéktábla mire újra ugyanarra a játékosra kerülne a sor. Szépen kivitelezett játék. Igazából 7 pontot érdemelne, a gyengébb osztályzat annak szól, hogy nem igazán hozzám illő stílusú.

Cute racing game, where you are trying to manage your movement by activating cards.  It is a game of efficiency as you align you Acolyte with the clockwork-gear-like movements of a number of shifting platforms.   

Perhaps, it could be a bit much for APers, but I found it to be pretty easy going.  You are only given six cards to work with so you are usually planning well ahead of time available movements.  Three players seems ideal because of the AP potential.

My only real gripe about the game is the set up is overblown.  You should just give other players your pieces and have then place them scattered around the board.  

I should mention, how pretty the game is...

This game has really neat bits and some novel mechanics.  More specifically, the plastic pieces have really, really good detail on them, and I like how you play cards to change the maze you're moving through and the more you change it, the farther you get to travel.  Given that, I'd really like to give this a higher rating, but fundamentally, it's a race game, and I'm just not all that into race games.

Not so interesting game (for 4 players) for the following reasons.

1. You can not have any real long term planning, as by the time its your turn again, the board had shifted and changed so much that you need to re-calculate your moves.
2. Too much downtime - each turn takes each player a long time to think, and combined with the first reason the waiting between turns is too long.

Let's get the obvious out of the way first - what a mind-boggling choice for a game name!!  It doesn't invoke excitement, and it certainly doesn't lend itself to being easily remembered by potential customers.  As for the game itself, I'm sort of teetering on the footbridge over the chasm, not sure if this game is going to survive or plummet to it's death.  The game is decent and well-designed, there's no doubt about that, but I'm as yet undecided on the fun factor.  On the plus side, it feels a little bit like a less brain-burny and more multiplayer version of "dungeon twister", a game that I have a love/hate relationship with (due to it's amazingly cool mechanics yet brain melting mental workload).  And you get to collect books.  I like to collect books.  My overflowing bookshelves are proof of that.  However, downtime is a bit of an issue due to the strong AP potential, but I'd like to try it with fewer than 4 players sometime.  And the physical design is a mix of spectacular (the gargoyles - which hardly ever even make it into the games, the monks, the books, and the board), confusing (the individual player cards which are written in Latin and have minimally helpful symbology - I think I just made up a word!), and fairly ugly (pretty much all the cards in the game).  I'll be interested to see how my rating changes with more plays and with fewer players, but for now I'm going to remain solidly wishy-washy on this one.  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 6.5/10

Amusingly vicious filler with a nice spatial element and a bizarre, pasted-on theme -- I've heard a number of people call it "Monktris". Julian suggested it would've made a perfect Harry Potter game: Hogwarts' moving staircases.

The cards aren't as clear as they could be and add a substantial luck factor. Still, generally it's possible to get in a good turn where a card or two help you and another card or two screws someone else. Who could ask for more? The game is only balanced if all players know to block the leader, but it's short enough not to matter much.

Race/tile-placement game which provides both depth and tension. Your role is that of an Acolyte who is attempting to collect four books that can only be accessed by a series of moving footbridges. Each turn you have the option of moving the tiles representing the footbridges in certain directions depending on the cards in your hand in an attempt to create a path to the books. There is some randomness introduced by cards that allow certain one-off actions, such as moving your opponents' Acolyte a certain number of spaces or destroying footbridges, and the decisions you face throughout the game revolve around furthering your cause or hindering that of your opponents. There's a lot here with puzzle elements, the race aspect and the ability to scupper other people's efforts, which results in a game with much to recommend it and plenty of re-playability.

Sort of abstracty race game where you move your monks over an abyss in an effort to collect the books which match your monks color.  Manipulation of the bridges on which you may walk is done by card draws, but the way these can be played minimizes hoseage from the randomness, though it does exist in a degree.

Interesting game, I would try it again, but not sure it's worth seeking out, or owning it.

An abstract with a LOAD of gorgeous, thematic chrome on top.  So much chrome (such as cards all in Latin) that it becomes just that much too much.  Plus 1/3 of the game is this complicated set-up only to ensure replayability/starting balance, and there is no way to mitigate down-time as the board at the end of your last turn will be drastically different from the board at the beginning of your next.  Not enough interaction, all tactics are reactive and very conditionally constrained by the (clever, actually) color/shape system.

Sator Arepo Tenet Opera Rotas wasn’t my kind of game. As I said in the Part 1 article: “Imagine an action-point puzzle game where the decisions of other players can randomly and severely interfere with your carefully planned puzzle solution. Its saving grace was that it didn’t last too long.” The game starts by randomly placing 4 colored books on the grid for each player and the winner is the first person to walk their monk to touch each of their books. The setup involves each player placing a handful of walkways on the board, which comes in a variety of shapes along the lines of Blokus pieces or Princes of Florence buildings. Then comes the actual game which gives each player 6 action points per turn (just like Kramer and Kiesling’s Java) to spend on playing and exchanging cards in order to move/rotate the walkways and move their monk towards their books. It’s an interesting concept, but was frustrating because action point games generally encourage careful planning to efficiently spend your limited action points. Yet this game seemed to involve one player accidentally and significantly interfering with their opponents’ plans, over and over. You could try to intentionally interfere with your opponents’ plans, which occurred from time to time, and is not something I mind in a game, but the frequency of inadvertently blocking and hindering your opponents seemed disproportionately high in this game. Maybe it was due to the four players all being new to the game, but it made the experience fairly frustrating and futile.

RATING: 6.5
This is a highly tactical, make the best of your hand, game.  The strategy is largely in the initial tile layout, most of the rest of the game is just working with the cards you get to move things around the board.  There's a little bit of messing with other players too.

Overall, it just didn't really make much of an impression with me.  I'd play it again without issue, but I don't think I'd particularly seek it out.

This game sells itself on its theme alone, but beyond that, there's just not a whole lot going on here that's interesting.  Player interaction is done through take-that cards which cost too few actions to do a tremendous amount of damage.  Also, players get six actions per turn to plan their moves, but too often it's in your best interest to not use some of those actions, since it requires you to spend cards to spend actions.  Action point games should force you to agonize over which ones to take, not give you a surplus that makes the turns self-evident.

Clever game. You and your fellow players try to manipulate the maze trying to work towards your objectives and hinder the others. Unfortunately it suffers very much from analysis paralysis; moreover you cannot think your moves in advance because the maze will almost always change in such a way between your turns that you should have to rethink your strategy anyway.

Move and rotate Tetris blocks on a grid. Try to be the first to collect four books of your colour. Long wait between turns when played with four.

Amazing Labyrinth and Wiz War mixed into one game; 'tis alright.  Good to play when you want something heavier than AL and less FUCKYOU than Wiz War.

As an abstract I rate this one a bit higher with merit for a card management system combined with a Tetrisesque style of game mechanics.  Plus, I really love the SATOR puzzle box name.

Fun game.  Caveat:  You can't plan anything until your turn comes around, and you will be screwing your neighbor regularly.  If you don't like these types of things in games, stay away.  Mechanics could lead to a bit of AP, but your card choices are somewhat limited, so it doesn't get too bad.

Absolutely wonderful game that is undoubtedly one of my favorites.

The rules are very simple and straightforward [i](once you get past the Latin names)[/i], and both the component quality and the artwork is excellent. 

You get all sorts of options for what you can do during a turn, but it's not overwhelming because the cards in your hand help to limit what you can do.  [i](Players prone to significant AP may still have some issues, though.)[/i]  

You can play it with minimal player interaction if that's the type of game you prefer but if you want things to get a little nastier there are numerous ways to directly mess with the plans of other players.

Purchased at Essen 2008. It's a lightly themed multiplayer abstract, requiring spatial awareness and some forward planning. A little prone to analysis paralysis and there can be a bit of downtime due to the board changing dramatically between turns . Not bad but I traded my copy away because it wasn't a good fit for my group.

I haven't played anything else quite like this game, and it is pretty entertaining.

The most difficult thing is to see the potential multiple rotation using different rotational vertices.

Un jeu trop peu connu qui propose une mécanique originale et bien méchante.
Excellent à 4 joueurs.
Superbe matériel.

Firstly, I love the theme and the inclusion of Latin is a very nice touch!  The Acolytes with their prayers collecting the sacred tomes all fits in very nicely with the overall mystical aura of this game.

The components are top notch on every account and I definitely felt as if I received my money's worth.  The sculpts are especially beautiful for the different colored Acolyte and Gargoyle figurines and the books.  Everything seems to be high quality and will last through many years of enjoyment.

If I were to have a gripe, this game just lacks in complexity.  Even though there is tons of strategy involved in order to win and many methods to screw over your opponent(s), the amount of available actions seems to be pretty limited as all is dictated by cards.  When all the cards are very similar in a player's hand, he/she is left with very few options on his/her turn.

An expansion or house rules could definitely resolve some of these issues, but it is a fun game out of the box... just not everyone would find it appealing.

GAME: Vampire: Prince of the City
RANK: 3421

RATING: 6
A nice and amusing game where you get to play on your clans strengths while trying to get control in the city. Althou there is a bit to many dices for my taste.

RATING: 4
Reminds me of I'm the boss, but not as good. Area control with some negotiation. Too much of a kingmaker issue I think. Didn't appeal to me.

RATING: 8
Nicely designed game. Reason it's only an 8 is because there is a slight RP aspect to it so you have to be a fan of the LARP in order to gain full enjoyment out of it.

RATING: 7
I've played the game a few times now, playing once with the maximum of six. Definitely a game that improves with more players as the diplomacy kicks into higher gear.  The gameplay is smooth and fairly thematic. Components are of good quality although the design leaves something to be desired. It is difficult to look at the board or cards and immediately see their value. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The rulebook is very hard to understand and it takes a few house rules to play smoothly.  It's like they tried to take everything from the RPG and stuff it into a board game.  The final result is full of character, but feels bloated.

A bit different boardgame that relies a bit more on what's happening around the board, not just on it. All the cards makes it a bit fiddly in the beginning, but it's a bit easier after a couple of plays. Feels like a very complete game if you play it with the right people.

Interesting game blending heavy theming with pseudo-euro design. Creates very unexpected tensions and strategies. Strong "attack the leader" mechanic, but it is appropriate and players have many abilities to mitigate it. Key play point is to avoid being in first while positioning oneself to swoop in and win, which matches the theme.

RATING: 6.5
Rated on one play. A slow starting game that can develop into an interesting political/social strategy challenge. Pretty hard for a player who's behind to get back into the game - so one false move can prove devastating if the other players capitalise on it. Terrible rule book for explaining things first time around - lots of time spent reading/re-reading things during the first game - seems to have a lot of unnecessary text.

RATING: 8
Becoming one of my favorite games.  I love the politics, diplomacy, backstabing, and the theme.  The event cards seem to act as a game balance, allowing those in last place to band together, exclude the leader, and gain a few extra points.  My main concern so far is the significant disadvantage in going first.

RATING: 8
Vampire: Prince of the City is a competitive area control game with a d10 success system. You play as Vampires in the World of Darkness setting struggling to become the next Prince of your city. Influence is bid and bartered to control different parts of town. There is a small asymmetrical aspect on the game, as each clan of Vampire has their own special abilities and strengths. The game works well with 3 to 5, but 2 players does not work too well, and solo play is out of the question. I love the atmosphere of this game. It manages to be competitive, but not too harsh. All-in-all, an excellent game, especially if you like the World of Darkness.

Despite being the "new" vampire setting, this is quite cool.  Uses the roleplaying trappings well.  Negotiation and backstabbing are key with more than three players. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
After one play: Surprisingly complex-- almost convoluted-- game depicting vampire gangs fighting over their metropolitan stronghold and the human  chattel they feed on. Mostly, it comes down to building prestige and influence. The nastier part about eating to stay alive is so subtly stated that it's merely implied. But is it fun? Some as a negotiation game. Moreso if you're of the Anne Rice school of "vampire culture." Ironically, THIS should have been the product tie-in for the Sin City movie.

RATING: 6.5
Es un juego de control de áreas ambientando en el mundo rolero de Vampire. Los jugadores llevan a un personaje (cada uno, una raza de vampiros con atributos propios) y deben ir superando desafios contra el juego (eventos) y contra otros jugadores (lucha por influencias en las zonas). Se pueden apoyar unos a otros jugadores. Hay cartas de equipamiento, y estrategia y demás, que te permiten añadir bonus al comportamiento de tu personaje. 
El juego está entretenido, pero con cinco jugadores a 9 turnos se hace algo largo. Tiene un factor de puteo/traición/negociación que me recuerda un poco al diplomacia.
Estéticamente no es gran cosa. El tablero es hexagonal. Destacan unicamente las figuras. El reglamento es bastante denso. Mucha letra y poca imagen. Pocos ejemplos. En la carta de ayuda se echan de menos algunas indicaciones.
No es de mis favoritos, pero no le diría que no a una partida.

As a fan of the Vampire:Requiem RPG I was looking forward to this. The game is not a decent adaptation of the RPG but it is a fun game none the less. The rules are not that well written and need several readings to get right. The game does well with a player-2-player interaction, with intrique and deals. My only dissapointment is the length of time the game takes. I'd rather a couple games in an evening than just one lengthy one.

RATING: 8
Initial rating after just one 4-player game (1 dyed-in-the-wool Eurogamer, 3 Ameritrash fans)... FAR more intriguing than I'd anticipated. Given Vampire's White Wolf heritage, our learning game was, perhaps, more difficult to initially understand than it would have been for gamers who are familiar with the Vampire: Masquerade/Jyhad/Eternal Struggle milieu. But after 3 or 4 turns, gameplay really started to flow easily and each player began to relish his or her role as the leader of a vampire clan. While our Eurogaming frontrunner was furious to realize that he couldn't win after being driven into torpor on the last turn by a coalition of his foes, I'm confident this will be hitting the table again soon (with MOST of tonight's group, at least)... and that the surviving veterans of our first foray into the vampire-haunted city will insist on a full 12-turn game.

UPDATE: After languishing unplayed for three years, I finally got this back to the table: 2 of us had played it before, 2 were neophytes. It was another rousing success, and I've raised my rating from a 7 to an 8 accordingly. If I have the good fortune to see the game make it into my group's regular rotation, that rating will probably increase. And while it plays well with 4, I suspect Vampire really shines with 5.

I love this game, being a big fan of Vampire: The Requiem, but the rules are horribly presented. The cheat sheet provided by BGG is invaluable. 

The other problem is the amount of time needed to play it. Two hours (the short game) is enough for the absolute basics, but you need to play for at least Three hours to get into the backstabbing that is a major part of this game.

A solid effort by a company known mostly for roleplaying games. It's not as "Euro" as many make it, though, Kingmaking abounds and your success will depend heavily on dicerolls. But this can be kind of forgiven as the atmosphere is ok and it is less "diplomatic" than one might think when first reading the rules. There are some traces of Cosmic Encounter here, which is nice, and the artwork is above par. The rules might put some off because of their verboseness, but basically they are well done (better explain too much than to little).

Review currently based on 1 play with 3 players. I really enjoyed the mechanics to this game. The event cards can give or take away prestige and often have some nasty side effect which gives players an incentive to remove them. In the game I played I built an early lead and by the end of the third turn in a six turn game had about a 20% advantage over my opponents. Then a random event occurred which caused me to lose two vitae a turn. And a second which slowed movement to one sector per turn. Since they both possessed the ability to avoid vitae loss neither would cooperate with me in resolving that event. And since I was alone on one side of the board which I owned they would not cooperate with eliminating the other either. The result was I had to slowly move through areas I already controlled to get to new areas to influence meanwhile using my resource phases to consume retainers and hunt to keep from entering torpor. Frustrating but also excellent play on their part. Suspect the game will rate slightly higher with more players.

Fun game for everyone, regardless of their prior experience with White Wolf games (my mother, for example). It has some nice strategic elements and the forging of tense "alliances" with the constant fear of backstabbing.

While the "luck o' the dice" somewhat hampers the strategic gameplay aspects, it does seem fairly well balanced and does not seem to cause upsets in our group's gameplay.

It is a stunningly beautiful game as well; the artwork is very evocative of the mood and theme of the game.

Okay, disclaimer: I hate horror-theme games like Arkham Horror and Last Night on Earth. This game reminds me of Arkham, so I wasn't looking forward to it. It turns out to be more of a area-control game, with a Risk-like feel, with a hint of coorperation. Problem is, our first game took four hours. Could be faster with more experience. I'm glad I played, but I don't think I'll be playing this one again for a long time.

It has long been the favorite in my gaming group. It's a wonderful game, combining both co-op and player vs player. Things do get ugly every now and then, with players teaming up on another one, always vying for the domination, or at least the ability to take it when it matters. I've had many a time where I was playing really well only to get 2 or 3 other players team up against me in the last round :)
We feel that, given a slightly more accessible setting, this game would fare a lot better in terms of popularity. But then again the settings match with the gameplay.

An interesting game that I would really like to play again.  It took a couple turns before we figured out what was going on and in the beginning everybody was like "what".  By the end of the game everybody had a good grasp of how everything worked and said they enjoyed it.

I like the fact that each Clan of Vampires has different traits that give them advantages and disadvantages.

I was told that the game closely modeled the aptly named RPG of the same title which I have not played, but I for one found the theme to be a bit distantly tied.  It also seemed to be a bit of a conflicted/confused design.  Regardless, the game still played well and probably a lot better with a full compliment (my one game was with three).  I wouldn't mind playing again now that I understand all the myriad of bonuses, abilities, cards, and such which are quite plentiful - perhaps even frightening to a new gamer.  Beware though, there are lots of dice and exception cases abound in this one.

I love the Vampire Theme and used to play and storytell the Vampire: The Masquerade LARP (Live action Role Playing)  So I just had to buy this game  if only for the vampire theme, but to be honest I was sceptical about the Board Game being good.  I find it very difficult to get a good balance between theme and mechanics in Board Games).  But I can happily state that Mike Nudd has made a grate job in combining both.  It really captures the essence of the intrigues, politics, power hungry and backstabbing world of Vampires and still has good game mechanics and a lot of room for strategic thinking.

After a single short (six turns) game with five people, I have to say - this was better than I expected. Yes, it's very random and this first game dragged more than it should (understandable though, given it was a first playthrough).

This initial rating is rather tentative and may go either way, probably down more than up. I can't say I'm looking forward another game of this, but will certainly play if invited, if only to give it another go and learn more about its pros and cons.

EDIT: sold it off after the few people actually interested in playing this moved away and stopped attending my monthly meet-ups. Not a large chance this would ever see more play. Too bad, it was a really nice looker!

Too Long + Too Complicated = Not Fun. And while I dispise the company, I have been playing their games in tabletop and LARP for going on 15 years. I made the mistake of thinking even if this wasn't soooo good it would still appeal to myself and other LARP friends because of the theme. No.. no.. don't subject your friends to this. There are sooo many other good horror or genre humor games that will at least deliver some fun.

Just Fine. Great game for Vampire RPG fans. You can play it as if you were playing a chronicle. Make alliances, play a character with a different Demeanor and Nature through each game. Exclusively for 5 players, and your fun factor is VERY playing group dependant: You need interacting players. You can enjoy this game the most, if you play it with the same group of people you enjoy Citadels or El Grande. Only for Vampire RPG Fans though, beacuse the mechanics are not as elegant as they should, and the luck factor is present all the time. One thing that bothers me the most, is the playing time. More than 4 hours inside a very repetitive rutine.

Rule book could've been clearer, but easy once you get the hang of things. Though the game has a few balance issues here and there, the abilites that are unique to each players is nicelly balanced. Event cards can influence the game a tad to much from time to time. Doesn't really work with 3 players.

Apart from the above; Really great game! Being in front and being forced to move first is really a pain in the...
Lots of room for scheming and back-stabbing, but occasional need for co-operation can form sudden and surprising alliances.

This game was a complete and positive surprise to me, we've had this game around for a couple of years, but just recently had a chance to actually play. I must admit, I wasn't too enthusiastic at first, but the game really shone at least in our gaming group, which is filled with Vampire fans. Only one house rule added, with the game ending after "last" round on a die roll of 7+, and odds of that increasing after each round after that.

Please don't make me play this again.  Cards with tiny typefaces - certainly far to small to be read from the other side of the table; lots of dice-rolling (d10s, so the results are REALLY random); chuff-all in the way of atmosphere; below average (for 2006) components; oh, and it's long - a "short" game should take 2 hours (I really wouldn't know - 90 minutes in and I was looking to slit my own wrists).

Perhaps the White Wolf fans will buy it; perhaps it will appeal to some people without an aversion to d10 dice; perhaps I've spent too long playing streamlined Eurogames.  But dammit, if I've got 2 hours to spare I don't want to waste it with stuff like this that struggles to be "average".

Rating after one play (well, 4 turns and walked out of a game with another of the 4 players): Way Way WAAAAYYY too much going on.  Cosmic Encounter with triple hidden rotating variable powers, four flare decks dealt three cards per turn (six to the player to the left of the leader), and cards being wild when played sideways would have NOTHING on VPotC.  It took us an hour to figure out the rules.  No, who am I kidding?  After an hour and a half of play AFTER that hour, we were STILL figuring out the rules. Powers are unbalanced and confusing, cards often useless or devastating, 'battle' rules confusing as well.  It was like a game of Cosmic Encounter meets Risk meets Dungeons & Dragons meets Fluxx meets Pokemon meets Settlers of Catan.  Maybe if two-thirds of the game elements, selected at random, were moved off into different games, then Vampire: Prince of the City would be three great games, instead of one bad one.  I might be talked into trying it again (with a powerful bribe), but a rating of 4 requires "could be talked into it ON OCCASION" and I don't see myself playing it twice more.

Essentially an area-control strategy game like Twilight Struggle, with heavy diplomacy (if multiplayer) and power-skewing card effects and combos. Pity for the confusingly written and incomplete rulebook which may put people off.

Intriguing game. A game where being mean is big part of the fun. Includes a good amount of negotiations and strategizing. 
Had so much fun when we played it again after a long while - with real gamers. I had tried it once with people that were too nice - almost no player challenges - and wasn't fun for anyone.

This is an old style American game. I would have played this kind of game years ago and would not have been bothered by the time it takes to play. However, in todays gaming scene this game is a little too long for what it is. Oh and there is lots of dice rolling too.

It was the biggest gaming disappointment of my life. Really wanted to like it, lots of cool ideas, but the game doesn't work, the rules don't answer questions that arise in  typical situations in the game, and the whole thing feels like an early prototype.

RATING: 6
Wrong theme entirely, so the special events and effects get driven by a need to tie-in to the RPG.  The result is that a potentially interesting area majority game is overwhelmed by the chrome which also makes it too long.  Some of the clever stuff is very clever indeed though.

Only played 1 game, but it was rather tortuous as no-one had played before. Not one I could get my teeth into!! I really hate tiny text that you are supposed to read from the other side of the board. Artwork and components defintely below average. Theme was good, but took far too looooong!!

Way too long, somewhat too random, way too much attacking the leader. Poor graphic design on the components, in both beauty and usability. On the plus side: side nice color, some fun cardplay. A fan of long, American take-that games would give it a more average score.

Wow, where did this game come from?

From the description and looks of the game on White Wolf's website, it looks like it has been 'inspired' by games like Settlers of Catan (board layout) and more recently, Nexus Ops (resource generation, troops, etc).

I really enjoy this game. I think it does a decent job of conveying the feel of the new World of Darkness. Deal-making (and breaking) adds to the fun, and the deck of cards yields some decent replay value. However, my gaming friends don't seem to enjoy the game quite as much. They think that there is a runaway leader problem, and yet they also claim there is a leader-bashing problem. I admit that there is a king-making aspect to the endgame, but that fits right in with the theme.

While Prince of the City plays great with four or five players, I suspect that it would be even more fun with more players, so I'm hoping for an expansion. Actually, I went ahead and created a second set of five vampires, based on the five bloodlines in the back of the Requieum rpg rulebook. I found the appropriate clan-type symbols online and used them to create lots of cardboard counters for the new bloodlines. Now if I could just get some more players together for a big game...

I love this game.  Then again, I love all Vampire games.  But this one does excellent justice to the White Wolf theme.  The only downside is that the person leading in the final turn will NOT win. Such a weird downside.

It was ok to begin with, but then the rule book was hard to understand and we were constantly surprised as I was ahead by a long shot, only to find out that torpor in the last round made it to where you couldn't win the game...dumbest rule ever. Was so not fun to have done all of that work just for it to be knocked out in one round. I hated that rule. May play again to give another chance now that I know that that rule is there.

Interesting aim to merge area control with a vampire theme. 

Much of the fluff is interesting; the different abilities between the houses, the different challanges and events change up the pace and focus of the game but with all incorperated together it begs to be more streamlined.

What a shame.

I thought this was a pretty good little game.  Very tense area control battle over the entire city.  Must congregate to get sections of the city, and each of the factions had their own special powers.

If it had a flaw, I believe it's because the game broke down a little at the end, and ended up in a bit of a kingmake.  Perhaps that is part of the theme, but in boardgames, it wasn't great.  Still I would play this again.

Incredibly luck based, the entire game can change based upon the appearance of event cards.  Since ten-sided dice are used to resolve conflict, it adds even more to the luck factor.  The area control mechanics are well done and the move anywhere gameplay prevents turtling in the classic sense.  However, the fact that the leader can become targeted and killed on the last turn of the game, automatically removing him from contention, means that a long game session can simply be thrown away by what, for all intents and purposes, would be considered a valid "best move."

Seems like a game that a lot of people will love because it's about 80% complete and gives the feeling that some tweeks will fix the game. But with all the games that are out there, why spend time playtesting your tweeks to a game to fix it?

RATING: 7.6
On the surface, this game looks appealing as a backstabbing negotiation game. Sort of Diplomacy for children of the night. Upon reading the rules, it's that and more. I can see that with the right group of gamers that appreciate Vampire mythos, this game could even be under appreciated. The theme is right in line with the likes of shows or movies like Underworld or True Blood. The old master has died a "true death" and everyone playing want to become the new leader of the immortals. The game is really about combining area control and personal prestige for a winning score. I can see both the negotiation aspects of it as well as the need to be ruthless if you want to win the title. There might be luck of event and support cards and die rolling but you play to your strengths and what you have, and might join up with others at the right time to beat down the leader. The game runs a fixed length of your choosing so it's up to how long you want your session to endure.

RATING: 6.8
Juego de guerras napoleonicas. Los turnos tienen cuatro fases. Asignación de órdenes, fase de cartas, acciones y recuperación. Hay una pieza que es el CC (comander in chief) que transmite las órdenes a los UGC (Unit group comander) Las órdenes pueden llegar o no llegar. Básicamente sirven para "configurar" las unidades que pueden tomar cuatro actitudes (atacar, defender, maniobrar y reserva). En cada uno de esos estados, pueden hacer sus acciones en dos segmentos. En el segmento 1 pueden cambiar la formación, disparar o moverse. En el segmento 2 pueden cambiar la formación y hacer cargas o cuerpo a cuerpo. Cada una de estas acciones tiene sus peculiaridades según la orden en que esté configurada la unidad.
Las unidades son orientables (hay flancos) y existen multitud de modificadores que se aplican para determinar el efecto de la acción (terreno, presencia del comandante, obstáculos, según la formación en que se estén). Eso hace algo tedioso, si no se controla bien, el desarrollo del juego. Se hace algo lento. 
Imagino que controlando bien el reglamento y con las tablas de ayuda correspondientes, el juego gane mucho.
Se configura por escenarios. Los combates se resuelven simplemente calculando un factor de daño y aplicando la acción que corresponda según una carta extraída a tal efecto. Además, las cartas también sirven como eventos y como reacciones a acciones del enemigo.
Está bien, pero tiene demasiados parámetros y puede llegar a apabullar en algún momento.

The more I play this more more I like it. But these rules are just a bear. I love the components to this game. I love the initiative system, I really like the decisions on facing although some are still a little fuzzy. 
This game plays in about 3 to 4 hours but almost every minute you are engaged in the game. The event cards are pretty awesome. Cant wait to play again

I love the parts. I hate the rules.  The rules are WAY too complex for me to learn in 300 seconds.  

I think I'll make my own rules for fast and quick booklearnin.  DONE.
It is close to the same rules at battlecry now.  NOW it is fun.   My only distraction is that I keep tweeking the darned rules instead of just PLAYING it.

After owning this for over a year, I finally had to learn it to demo at Origins.  This game plays exactly like a very good Napoleonic game should, excellent system for sending and receiving orders, chain of command, formation change, cavalry, moral, routs etc...  All of my players at Origins 2011 were very pleased and enjoyed the gameplay.  This is an excellent marriage of board game and minis.  Oh yea, a beautiful game to boot, nicely illustrated maps, beautiful paintings on the unit and commander cards, decent figures.  If you are a fan of this era of gaming, get it.

The order system and the formations are the two most brilliant features of this game. The modificators are a bit fiddly but I'm sure after a few games one won't need the tables anymore.

There's quite some luck, with dice and cards, but so far I think that's it not nearly as bad in this regard as, say, Memoir 44 (which I hate).

Minis are superb (though unglueable...), as is the quality of alle the materials. For the cards, I would have wished for those "structured" ones FFG uses instead of these slick glossy ones. The paper chosen for the booklets was perfect, classy!

RATING: 7
As a long time Napoleonic enthusiast I have been impatiently awaiting the release of this title. Overall impressions are somewhat disappointing. Specifically;
1. The game seems well overpriced for what you get. Italieri figures can be bought easily and far cheaper, and the plastic used here is not up to the standard of regular Italieri stuff.  
2. You WILL need to paint the figures to get full enjoyment as many of the differnet types have poses so similar as to create confusion. Bad choice of figures I think - the Italieri range is much more expansive than this and could have been used to better effect. Many complained about the WOTR figures being hard to distinguish in play - just wait until you try this! Not a personal problem (I will be painting mine), but a problem for many I suspect.
3. The game boards, although very thick, warp easily, and you WILL need a perspex sheet or similar to lay over them. Although geomorphic, some combinations do not fit well togther, and look strange with slightly weird colour contrasts. They are of course meant to give the impression of a period map, but I personally find them rather bland.
4. The various counters are also nicely thick, but are extremely bland and colourless. I think again the intention here was to give a "period feel", but the effect just appears to cheapen the look of the board in play to my mind, while failing to achieve the desired period effect. I shall be using other means and disposing of the counters.The pictures on them are actually cut off at the edges in many cases and are not sized to the counters themselves. The illustrations are also far to similar for rapidly taking in the status of your troops during play. Very bad quality and production for a game of this price.
5. The box is...well...enormous, and looks beautiful. The insert is thin however, and far, far to large for the components it needs to contain. Maybe they intend expansions to fit in here as well? Whatever, the georgeous box belies its contents imo.

So, the components leave much to be desired in my view for the price asked. HOWEVER.....the rules themselves are wonderful, an almost perfect mix of exciting gameplay and historical accuracy. Would have been so much better to pay half the price for the ruleset and buy my own figures.....
This then is a brave stab at miniature Napoleonics, but the package is overpriced and does not entirely meet the production standards I hoped for in several areas. Will I buy expansions? Definately yes - the ruleset alone makes this a definate for me. Hopefully the pricing for such will be more sensible however......
I score this as a 7.5 with hopes my rating will improve with expansions.

Very good game, reminiscent of the C&C series, but takes longer and is certainly more complex; offers more opportunities of leading units in particular (e.g. regarding their formation); takes some time to play well; setup relatively long; luck factor is certainly present, but in good proportion to strategy; the need to glue riders on their horses yourself is very irritating and questionable for such an expensive game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Was not completely convinced by my first play of this. I didn't think you got that much more depth from it than you do with 'C&C:Naps' but at the expense of a lot more fiddliness and length. 

The rule book (and player aids) are confusing and not well laid out. The combat modifiers for attacker and defender formations are particularly muddled. I didn't really like the combat resolution mechanic that much so it is doubtful if ensuring we were playing the modifiers will make me think better of the game anyway. Movement also seems ponderous and the line of sight rules, particularly relating to crests had holes in it.

On the plus side, the order system is pretty good and deserves to be hooked up with a better combat and movt mechanic.

It looks good set up but it's too big a box to keep if the game doesn't deliver. Will reassess the rules in case we were missing something and look at another scenario but probably heading for the sale pile.

RATING: 6
Players fight out historical Napoleonic battles, using modular hex maps and miniatures.  Players represent army commanders, and have to send order dispatches out to their unit commanders, who may or may not successfully interpret them.  Orders can be either Attack, Maneuverer, Defence or Reserve, and units activate in that order.  Units under order have a random activation chit assigned to them, which grants them an initiative number representing when they get to act during the action phase... clever.  Units can also be in different formations - line, column, open, square, limbered, etc, and use different combinations of combat - fire, melee, cavalry charge, etc.  The game plays well, and the rules read well, but this isn't a light game.  The orders, formations and different combats require a careful study to see just what a unit is permitted to do on its turn.  i.e. can it advance, melee, fire, etc.  Added to that are a raft of die roll modifiers for morale, fire, melee, orders, etc.  Once you crack the code, you have a very good game that is quite simple to play, and playing time dramatically decreases.  Getting your attacks coordinated and sent in requires some serious thought - but a hand of action and reaction cards can toss even perfect plans out the window.  Fantastic minis (even if they refuse to glue properly), attractive game boards (that warp!), results in a beautiful looking game in a huge game box.  Nexus scores again.  Gets better with every repeat play, as the mechanics are mastered.  Much more meaty and rewarding than Command and Colours.

A lot of holes in the rules, but this is a beautiful game, with a great board, a great number of interesting mechanics, and a way of evoking the Napoleonic wars.

RATING: 5
It does some interesting things well--the order chits, for example, are a nice alternative to IGO-UGO and make aggressive attacks powerful but a bit risky. 
That said, the overall command and control is tedious and fiddly more than interesting, and the combat CRTs are awfully swingy. You end up spending a long time slogging and very little time making decisions.

My son-in-law, Steve, bought this for me during our visit to Cool Stuff Games (www.coolstuffinc.com) in Orlando Florida last week. It was truly a surprise.

The parts are fiddly. Especially the horseback riders. I'm afraid they will have to be glued on. Likewise, the cannon barrels will also have to be glued together as they do not stay snapped into their base. Overall I'm really disappointed in the quality of this game. It looks as if more QC went into the box (oh it's nice) than the game components.

This game is not complicated.  It has terrible rules, with tons of spelling/grammar errors, rules that are left vague or not addressed, no index, and plenty of rule page skipping to find the rules for a particular instance (Please can someone write a rulebook where they repeat rules in different places so I don't have to search every page for the one line I need to find!) and there are several logic inconsistencies within the book.  I have played several Napoleonic mini rule sets as well as boardgames and I think there is a good game here but the rules are so poorly done and the combat system is so clunky that one small scenario of this game takes longer than two 4x6 tables filled with over 6,000 minis playing by the new Black Powder rules.  That should never happen.

It's a solid game. Yes there are a handful of baffling rules omissions, yes some of the production choices may grate a little, and yes the system is wide open for house rules and tinkering (to mold it into whatever matches your interpretation of the period), but if you want a Napoleonic miniatures set in a box this as good as you're ever likely to get.

We played the largest battle in the book ("Attack of the 1st Corps") in under 3 1/2 hours, not including set up. 

Suspect those whinging that they won't touch it until a FAQ appears are in the wrong hobby.

Of all board wargames I've played this is the closest to an actual figures wargame that I know. Commanders have to despatch orders which may (or may not) be acted upon, infantry units can form line, column and square, breaking the enemies morale can force them to rout etc. The commonents are of a very high standard, and if, like me, you paint the figures the overall look of the game is quite breath-taking.

I have added a review to this site, so my main observations on gameplay are there.

I enjoyed the game and am pleased to see a game that takes the marriage between figures and hexes to the next level.

There is a learning curve to the game but as it is intended for repeated play, the investment in time is worthwhile. 

The game provides a good launch pad for 'tinkerers' who like to add and drop rules and who might want to use the boards to use figures from their own collections to create games for other periods.

Bought the last box set at the local store the Sentry Box and it's got really bad shelf wear, torn corners and faded colors. The insert is damaged as well, the boards are really warped, not to happy with my purchase but knowing that this might not hit shelfs again or atleast for quite sometime I wanted to get a copy. Now I'll need to try out the rules and see how the game play is, looks like something I will enjoy being a fan of Memoir 44, Battlelore, C & C and Battle of Westeros. 

Have played several games now and for the most part the rules are fairly clear, a lot to remember but a great tactical game. It's a game you need to play a few times in a row to get the rules correctly and keep them fresh.

This is one of those games too monstrous even for me to play.  I loved the old detergent-sized boxes old SPI monster games came in, and played plenty of them.  And this one, while not as bulky, is just too big!  It is beautiful==the map should hang on the wall...of a museum perhaps.  When a card proved to have an error on it, I received an ENTIRE new set of cards.  Just correcting the one would have sufficed, but the company clearly gives good service.  I was looking for Battle Cry for Napoleonics and this was just a little more complex than I was going for.

I liked many of the ideas of this and the concept of the 11-18 result system (how many Spinal Tap jokes are going to be told over the life of this game?) but really I was more frustrated by the game than anything else.  

First and foremost, the over-production is invasive. I could never tell which units were which.  I'm not sure who thought it was a good idea to have three different sculpts be the same unit and then have another very different unit with two sculpts that look more like the some of the other unit's variants than each other.  I could forgive the microscopic print which makes the set-up time absurd, but trying to figure out which fig goes where was obnoxious and playing with them impractical.  

In addition, I know that I'm bringing my own baggage into this, but I just like a little more action in my battle games.  It takes so much effort to move units around and when they engage the results of your hard work feels so minuscule.  Perhaps I'm spoiled with BattleLore or Combat Commander as there is far more movement and actual combat results in that game.  Here you move one or two hexes and then you just roll the dice over and over again to meet a threshold of success and then hoping to get worthwhile results on the card CRT.  When you do, often it means that your opponent must take their turn to get rid of a stall chit, so you trade turns making other players lose turns.  So you count up your one million modifiers, they count up their various modifiers (drawn from a number of different and sometimes poorly labeled tables) then roll the die.  If you are actually successful then you flip a card for a result, hopefully then in an extreme best case scenario you have successfully weakened your enemy a little bit. Or you can then instead of actually damaging your foe with gunfire and cannons you might scare them off with another extreme dice roll. I mean really, do I want to play a war game where it feels like people are just standing and shoving each other, back and forth, over and over?  Slow and dull.  This should have been a WWI trench game.

My biggest frustration was, contrasting the quagmire, the super power cards did all the action for you.  So often I felt that drawing good cards was far more important than any action you could decide upon on the board. 

If it takes hours to kill one or two guys and then someone draws a magical resurrection card it makes the whole thing feel rather laborious and frankly pointless.

Just sitting, Beautiful bits. Looks like loads of fun. The reason we all play these damn games. But. It's nicer to have a partner to play. This is a prime example of how I protect my games now. I leave the shrink on, then I cover the top then the sides with clear even flat runs of packing tape. DO NOT tape the bottom waste of tape!LOL! then I cut the bottome piece of shrink out being very careful and patient, and Tada! you have the tops and sides of your game protected with a tape cover that fits nice and tight. I use 2mm or 3mm brilliantly colored Funky foam spot glued to a piece of cardboard the same size of the game + 1/4 inch on all sides or 1/8 doesn't matter. Now your game is protected from shelf rash or wear for ever. Why didn't all games do this to begin with. Well it takes time. All a gamer can think about it opening the game, punching the counters and playing. Get sick of the game, then wonder why the box looks so shitty and olny sell for a fraction. Got to take care of these games now. They are expensive, not 4.99 back in the good ol' days.LOL!LLLLLOOL! If any one asks I have a couple ways to protect your valuable comodity as a friend puts it.

This is a really good Napoleonic bash! Captures the ebb and flow of the napoleonic period.
Eventually its pretty straight forward to play once i got my head round the rules.

For someone who doesn't want to get into the world of tabletop Napoleonics miniature games (meaning miniature based, non-board games), but wants more Napoleonic depth to their board gaming experience, this is an excellent fit.  It has many of the elements of Napoleonic tactical level warfare that make it feel "Napoleonic" and not just moving figures around a board.  Things like formation changes, order dispatches, cannon, cavalry, and infantry are all represented here and at a medium level of detail (i.e. not every unit has the same stats, but it may not differentiate between the 1st and 5th French Ligne units as an example).  There isn't the excruciating level of detail some may want, but for me, it was definitely enough to make me feel like I'm playing a Napoleonic battle and not just a game of risk.  On top of this add great 1/72 scale miniatures taken from the more traditional miniature gaming realm, along with the beautiful artwork on the cards and nice looking board - this game is a real winner for me.  C&C seems to be a popular rule set for Napoleonic board games that many have played, I'd categorize this as a more detailed and complex game without stepping full force into a miniature tabletop tactical game.

Now, that being said, there are some rule clarifications needed (get BGG FAQ, which helps a lot).  Most of this stems from having a more detailed rule set, which can and does create a lot more questions from players.   

I feel this game has a niche market, and if you're in that niche, it's a perfect fit.  Many like the feel of simpler games that have fewer rules, while on the other hand there are many that prefer the detailed mechanics that come with true tabletop miniature gaming.  I wanted something that really melded the two together and gave me the simplicity of a table top game with a good bit of Napoleonic details and intricacies, which is what BoN does, and does very well despite its few issues.

All outstanding production value aside, this game does an excellent job of mirroring the frustrations with issuing orders and keeping formations organized on the Napoleonic battlefields.  It's a slower game than say Commands and Colors but has its own rewards.

Awesome Game. Puts you in tactical command of the battlefield; it is not a grand strategy game. Great minatures which I painted half of. Great method of giving commands to troops via proximity of commanders and unit cohesion. All Napoleonic military concepts are here such as squaring, tiring, and mock charging (half charge), breaking. I am surprised FFG stopped printing this game. I would like to see more history games like this with such awesome componenets. FFG are leaders.

I have read the rules and played a solo game and excellent system with a few minor issues (your opinion my vary). I highly recommend this game to anyone interested in Napoleonic battles or just a really good tactical game.

Best Wargame i have ever played. The epoch is perfect for me (german pacifist) and the game has enough depths to be fun.

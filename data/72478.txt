I'll refrain from rating this game since I designed it. But I do have a comment :) 

If the amount of chaos and lack of control with 4 players is not to your taste, please try Trollhalla with 3 (and better yet) 2 players. With fewer players it feels quite a bit more tactical/strategic and simply (IMHO) more fun.

A family set collection game with a weird troll/Vikings theme and cartoony artwork. It has simple rules, it plays fast with only a few random elements and zero downtime. All in all, there is nothing wrong with the game but I found it a bit dull. I also think that the weird theme isn't the best choice for a family game.

RATING: 6.5
I'm not sure what the fuss is about.   It's a decent game, but nothing more.   I'm not fond of games where it's entirely possible to fall out of contention early, through no fault of one's own, and never have a chance to pull even remotely close to the pack.  It's not about winning, but when you could have doubled your score in and still not even been close to getting out of last then a game is seriously flawed.  In our first game, I finished with 26 points to 68, 77 and 77.  I made ONE mistake in the game, which was late - long after I was guaranteed last place - that cost me six points.  Several times in the game, when my turn came, either all the boats were full or there were only really bad places for me to place trolls.  Certainly this was just bad luck, but for me the only saving grace was that the game only lasted an hour.  I'll probably give it another go, but a game so badly flawed as to allow the situation I encountered will always be a little broken IMO.

For an elephant  trading game, this is a real troll of a game.  Actually, the troll theme and game play works better than expected for a 'pasted on' theme.  This is not a deep strategy game, but its no filler either.  Its also not a super filler.  Play decisions are interesting with player placement order driving the key outcomes.  Game length is just about right for the complexity and should hone right in with repeat plays.  Could be a good opening game for a longer night of games.

I bought this game after having enjoyed Alf's latest opus: Road to Canterbury (and after having received a very kind geekmail from the designer... but this is another story!).
Trollhalla is lighter than the games I usually enjoy, but it has many of the things I loved in RtC: simple, straightforward rules coupled with a "kniziaesque" scoring system, resulting in a game space were players face decisions in every turn.
The theme is amusing (definitely more after having seen Muppets' "In the Navy" video, as referenced by Alf in its Designer Diary) although the game is almost abstract, and the gorgeous production by Z-man helps a lot in bringing it to life.
Trollhalla is a game I would gladly recommend to families and I'll look forward to play with my daughters when they will be old enough!

I do really enjoy it:  Fast turns, simple mechanics, subtle nuance.  Definitely plays well during lunch hour.  But I can see how someone could just fall into a really good score and the other players feeling somewhat helpless to overcome it.  So, it is a bit too "random feeling" than what I would ultimately prefer.  (This may not be fair however... I suspect with more plays I will feel more "in control" of the game.)

RATING: 8
A thoroughly enjoyable game.  The game moves very quickly, and while the choices of what to do on any given turn are simple, there are a few different mechanisms at work that are worth considering.  There is very little downtime between turns, as the choice of what to do is limited, however, the impacts of what to do, and how you can manipulate that through the gathering and playing of cards is very important.

There is a deal of randomness in the game, but it isn't the sort that leads to regard a game as won or lost on a random swing, rather it's the sort that adds a flavour of uncertainty to the mix - which I really enjoy.

There are wonderful opportunities for clever and devastating turns, and pulling one off is a great feeling.  There is a deal of player interaction and the opportunity to be nasty - but the game doesn't allow you to take it too seriously, it's all a part of the experience - you are a bunch of Trolls squabbling over looted booty after all!

The theme is also a lot of fun - just setting up the board and looking at the placement of the tiles led us to have a laugh, and the idea of Trolls sailing the high seas for riches and glory is an amusing one, wonderfully supported by the art.

All in all an excellent game, the set-up is easy, the game play is straight forward, the choices are simple, but there is depth as well.  The best thing of all is that the game manages to pack all of it in to a very quick and short playing time - a wonderful game I heartily enjoyed.

Components: Nice tokens, and fun details on the islands. I'm not a fan of the meandering dotted lines on the board, or the weather symbols that are easily obscured by stacked icons.

Experience: Is this worker placement? I'm not sure it is, anymore than Go is worker placement.

Pretty random set collection game. Even when I decided to go gung ho for goats, I still didn't even come close. Luck plays a strong role, not just in the dispersion of the tiles, but in which player is lucky enough to get a sailing ship at the end of their turn.

When I saw that Alf Seegert had designed another game I snapped it up because I love Bridge Troll. (To digress, I rarely find games amusing such as Killer Bunnies.  The humor behind Bridge Trolls I find the most enjoyable of any game I have played.  I also loved the original mechanics, and even the graphics are perfect for the game although they are not the type of graphics I usually like.)  So there was no hesitation in getting Trollhalla.  And I have not been disappointed.

In both games the trolls and characters are familiar and Ryan Laukat is the same graphic artist; and the Billy Goat bullies the trolls. The games themselves are very different with no other similarities.

This is such a well thought out & designed game: It is very difficult to hog spaces on the boats that plunder islands.  Cards are a bonus, but rules govern play and cards at the end of the game are a penalty, which guards against hogging cards.  Sea routes are obvious. Not being able to put your tokens next to each other in boats and sea lanes makes a huge difference and a key rule in how well the game plays--just very well tested and put together.

What I especially like about this game are the "mixed strategies".  For instance, going for the most of one type of tile scores bonus points for the largest set and points for each tile.  However, the set that gives the most points (+25 for the Billy Goats) scores the least per tile (+1 for each Billy Goat tile), while the Bull tiles score 6 pts each, but only +4 points for the largest set.  Likewise, maneuvering for position on the chief Troll's boat might just lose your island plunder, and visa versa, due to competing sea routes.

Strategically I kept my eye on my positions on the boat, the boat's orientation, cards I held, the positions on the Chief Troll's boat, domination of the sea lanes, sets being collected by the players, how close the boats were to filling, and more.  There is a lot to watch yet, I did NOT feel over whelmed, at all.  

There are so many ways the game can un-expectantly change but none of them complicated, and all of them fun.  There is so much to watch, that I was surprised more than once by opponents whose moves changed everything completely, including who was in the lead!  The surprises generated a lot of laughs.

No score keeping until the end of the game--so no tokens that keep getting knocked off the score track, and the element of not really knowing who is going to win.

The game has re-playability. Two variants are suggested, one of which, The Weather Tile Variant, adds more strategy to the game by removing the random card draw.

My only complaint: In poor light the red & orange are too close in color.  Yellow in place of the orange would be much better.

Played first with 3 people.  Probably works with 2, but looking forward to playing tonight with 4.

I am more impressed with this game than I thought I would be, even though I was looking forward to it.  Even though we are playing with gross little trolls, there is unexpected subtlety in play.

A game that I feel is slightly underrated. Trollhalla turned out to be more fun and strategic than I thought it would be. The rules are simple enough and the board looks too much for children to have any weight. Wrong! There are multiple plans a player can take to make points and there are ways to screw your opponent while helping yourself or you may just help your opponent as well. Some chaos that feels almost random involving the placement of filler "great troll" tokens, but they only serve to run the game better - although it means a few aspects will be out of one's control. Overall, a fun experience. Not terribly meaty, but definitely satisfying.

My husband and I really, really like Trollhalla. We have a lot of trouble learning complicated games, but we like enough complexity to engage our brains. We also like plenty of decsisions that matter to the outcome of the game, but we like enough luck to spice up the game with uncertainty. This game has the perfect balance of simplicity and complexity, and of self-determination and luck. The quality and design of the components are outstanding, and the humorous artwork adds greatly to the enjoyment. The rules are exceptionally well-written. Trollhalla has a permanent place in my collection.

RATING: N/A
I came across Trollhalla in researching Alf's other games after buying Fantastiqa. However, after reading the rules, I wanted to provide some constructive criticism, for what it's worth. Note, I don't own this game, but would be willing to play, if for no other reason than to validate my conclusions below.

Overall, playing influence to guide ships is quite an interesting mechanic. I have concerns about how overpowered the Storm combination is, but overall felt it would be interesting to play.

However, there are two significant concerns I see with the game that IMHO lead to chaotic gameplay.

First, the player has very little control over which loot he gets, which in a set-collection game is a major concern (as another reviewer pointed out). The position in the ships matching loot positions on the islands seem unnecessary and is essentially impossible to control because the player has very little control over when a ship sails, which direction it will go, and which position it will be in when it arrives. For this reason, there is also basically no incentive for a player to play a troll in any position exception the first and last, which at least offer a modicum of control. To fix this problem, I believe that players need to be able to choose their loot from islands, with the order in the ship determining the order of choice (similar to Libertalia).

My second concern is with rolling dice to see which ship sails (and doing that only after you play weather cards). Without having an idea of when a ship will sail, the players have little to guide their decisions of where to focus their short- vs long-term efforts. Instead, they randomly plant seeds that might bear fruit, but with no predictability. This might be fine for players that enjoy a completely tactical experience, but it results in chaotic interactions that leave little room for strategy.

Lastly, a thematic issue: Trolls disembarking from a ship, grabbing loot, magically returning home and placing loot on a private boat (not on the board), and then the ship being stuck at the island until refilled, is pretty darn unthematic.

Why not have the trolls influence movement FROM an island (not the middle of the sea), and once the ship arrives there, one band of trolls then take over the ship, with the order on the ship playing into players' decisions of who can board (and perhaps the trolls on the ship take over the influencing on the island).

On a similar note, ships sailing upside down is also pretty goofy. Why not have a symmetrical ship, and use a marker to show which end goes first? Or better yet, make the first troll the captain (who gets first choice of loot), and who can change according to some mechanic (shades of Lifeboat here)? Such a mechanic would then allow trolls in the middle seats to get a crack at being captain and picking loot.

For what it's worth, I also think more rivalry between players' trolls would make sense thematically, and would allow for some rich player interactions.

These issues above, IMHO, lead to overly chaotic gameplay and are the main reasons that reviews are low and why they call out the excessive randomness in the game.

Some nice ideas, but the game is extremely chaotic and random. It's playable with just two players, as there is more control, but then the game seems to be lacking something. And luck is still high, possibly decisive, in particular when it comes to the die roll for the last boat to sail. On the artwork, it is expectedly as bad as in the thematic predecessor, "Bridge Troll".

A fun and often overlooked set collection game. It has a great combination of strategy and luck, but it's simple enough for just about anyone to play. Feels very similar to games like Takenoko in that it's a stand-alone game that offers a solid experience each and every time you play. It's also similar to Takenoko that it's not going to have much variation from game to game, but I'm not bothered by that as much.

Has some minor usability glitches:
- The red and brownish orange colors are too similar.

This is a pretty good game for something so light. Players have more opportunities to influence the game with their actions.  I really enjoyed playing and watching how it plays out on other players' turns.

Great fun. Maybe not as silly as the theme and name suggest. It's deceptively in depth. Maybe marketed to the wrong crowd.

Play-tester perspective. Trollhalla will please both gamers and non-gamers. It is an extremely fun and approachable game with many quick yet interesting decisions per turn. Trollhalla has good player interaction as players jockey to manipulate Troll Ship point to point movement paths and offset opponents plans. Players can recover quickly from momentary setbacks. The game is more tactical than strategic as players can't really plan too far ahead. The 2 player game will give players a bit more control in their planning. The game scales well, up to 4 players with quick play time (under 60 minutes). Finally, the game theme is fun and amusing and is great for fans of Alf's previous game - Bridge Troll.

Just plain wacky, but still somehow enjoyable. The theme helps keep everything light-hearted even in the most undesirable situations. Probably shouldn't be played with more than three players or the chaos gets too out of control.

I found the gameplay to be straightforward & easy to learn. The the pace will pick up significantly after only 2 turns. 
This should go over well with kids since there isn't any text to read in the game.
The instructions are a bit of a nightmare.

Bought this when I bought Bridge Troll (by the same game designer). When the kids didn't like Bridge Troll I decided to wait on giving this game. Finally gave it to them. They like it. Easy to learn, not very complex. My nephew now wants it. I think you could teach this to fairly young game players (my kids could have played it much younger than 8 years old).

RATING: 7
There is indeed chaos and randomness, but there is also opportunity for both strategy and tactics.  The game is short and accessible, so I'm ok with the level of chaos.  The different paths to victory are well balanced and must be juggled based on context.  It's not a deep game, but it's a well done light game, which means it will likely get played a lot.

Also, my 5 year old liked the game a lot can can start to plan ahead -- just omit the goat rule to avoid frustration.

The family really enjoys this one, but I prefer it with 2 players only. I just feel like I lose too much control with more players.

Trollhalla is a great family game that I would probably have bought four years ago.  These days, I already have a dearth of family games and this one doesn't quite reach the level of those.  Certainly up for another play anytime, but not a favorite just yet.  Great art and a fun theme, though.

Trollhalla can be played as a fun, light, family game. However, I was pleasantly surprised to realize that the strategy and complexity scales nicely with player experience. If you're looking for a great game that is easy to teach your friends, is wonderfully free of dominant strategies, but at the same time can be played with some deep thought, this is a game you might like. Re-playability is high as you realize that if only I had utilized one ability a  little more effectively, I could have had a higher score. Great game. Highly recommend.

Our whole family enjoys Trollhalla. It has a good mix of strategy and luck - so planning helps, but can be messed up by the other players which makes it a great family game where everyone has a chance.

Some very interesting mechanisms here, as goods and trolls are in fixed positions (spot 3 on the boat automatically earns good 3 on the island when it arrives), etc. So, you're trying to manipulate things properly to get what you want, spots on the boat are taken in a predefined order, so if you want spot 3, you have to wait until someone else takes spot 2 first, since it's illegal to have your own trolls side by side.

Throwing a massive wrench into all this is that players can play special cards to flip the boat upside down, so now your troll that was in seat 1 is now in seat 4, and won't get that item you wanted. Additionally, each boat has several destinations it can sail to, and players influence where they go, so you might want the boat to go North, but your two opponents want the boat to go east, and influence it that way.

It's a quick fun game, with a lot more going on than meets the eye. It's one of those games like If Wishes Were Fishes! that can look like a kids game, but is actually a medium weight gamers game.

A lot of fun, and the very unusual theme does add to the enjoyment, but I'm a bit unsure about how much you can control what happens in the game and how much it's just down to blind luck. Giving it a 7 for now until I'm more familiar with it.

I played this at a local Con and didn't really enjoy it.  In a four player game it is extremely hard to set up your trolls to gather the goods you want... and in a set collection game not being able to choose what you are collecting makes it a study in randomness.  There are some clever moves to be made with your scouts once the ships are full... but all in all its not something I'm interested in playing again.

Give a holla for Trollhalla!!  I have had the opportunity, nigh, the pleasure, to own and play this wonderful game with a number of people again and again.  My brother is in love with the game.  My friends smile and plot as they snake away my riches.  My father, who having trouble seeing these days, loves the minimal wording.  And I, I just plain love it.  

Playing with two, the game is great.  It is smooth, fun, relatively easy and quick to learn and engaging to continue playing.  I personally enjoy games that allow for more than two players and Trollhalla performs well with three and four players too.  Some games are meant to be played with two or three players even though they are marketed as four player game.  It's understandable that a publisher might push for more players to help sell the game, however, there is a risk of covering up a game's true potential by marketing it toward a larger player base.  In this case, I feel that Trollhalla dodged this fate.

I think this for a few reasons. For starters, it's a viking game.  Pillaging, plundering and shafting is the meat and potatoes of the mechanic and the theme.  Four players really brings this frustratingly fun aspect to life - a big plus in my book.  Four players changes the game dramatically from a back and forth, you or me, state of affairs to something far more epic.  You have to choose who gets thrown over board and when to watch your back.  It's like Settlers of Catan's cruel cousin - instead of bargaining you plead, instead of trading resources you trade knives in the back.  I love this game.

The turns a quick, the game is balanced, and you can't help but chomp at the bit to get back at your friend for screwing you over.  

The option of changing the weather icons is a fun little addition I didn't plan on giving a little more playability too.  

A great game for all ages as it is easy to learn. It is also accessible to a diverse set of folks which just speaks to the game's dynamism and cleverness (also to it's addictiveness).  

I really enjoy having this game in my collection and sharing with my friends.  Also, now that I think of it, it makes a great gateway game for the otherwise uninitiated - another wonderful quality to have in a game.  Trollhalla is an investment to put stock in.  

You can't go wrong with the clever artwork either... I really really love Ryan's work with this and Bridgetroll.  The humorous, romantic, fantastical concept is spot on.

A true success.  Get this game, have fun and thank Z-Man for putting it out there.

Demoed this version at a convention with the designer.  Adds a lot of depth to the original.  I love the original too, but I feel like this takes the game up a notch even higher.  This certainly adds some great complexity that may not be ideal for newer gamers.  For the sake of the review format, this is not an expansion but rather a different, more complex, version of Evolution.  If this is purchased by itself, it CAN be played as the standard version without the climate mechanics.  Basically two games in one.

What a cool concept!  Simple and fun mechanisms of evolving your species' but this game really captured the theme incredibly well!  You've got to stay ahead and keep evolving or you'll become irrelevant and go extinct.

My favourite game Evolution just got a whole extra layer added! I couldn't be happier with it. The climate board changes everything: body size is now of much greater importance; relying on the watering hole for food is now a risky option - alternative food sources are necessary - the "starve your opponents" strategy has just come to the fore! New traits mean there's a ton of new combos to explore. Brilliant. And top quality production values too.

I had previously played Evolution and backed the Climate edition. The new Climate rules make the game punishing I think in a very good way. The food pool is now more challenging to get what you need. New traits help you deal with the ever changing cold or heat, so you have to be willing to let species go and start in a new direction. As always, carnivores feel harsh and make the game less than familiy friendly. But for gamers who like to push each other around, this one is quite good.

(4 plays so far)

Quite a "heavy" game for non-boardgamers, so it is a bit of a time investment.

Beautiful Artwork, and very good gameplay.

Sadly, the Climate Tracker has had very little effect in my games so far.

Oh my! The information in this game is printed in extra minuscule font and dispersed all across the table. This makes playing the game extra frustrating as you have to be constantly asking other players what cards they have on the table. If you do not care to do this, you are basically screwed. So you better prepare for a lot of craning your neck. 

Compared with the original Evolution, this game has a nice extra thematic touch from the introduction of climate change. Mechanically the climate adds an extra variable to worry about when adding traits you your species. It also makes it harder for the bigger animals to survive which is a good thing because (provided that I remember correctly) in the original Evolution growing the body size of your animals did not have any negative effects. So here is a trade-off to ponder. Trade-offs are always nice. Moreover, climate introduces a fair amount of chaos to the game as its changes can be unpredictable and it has an ability to screw you up big time. 

Not a bad game but has an unnecessarily steep and artificial learning curve due to the bad graphic design by making necessary information unreadable to the players. I should also mention, that the game is best played if players take their turns simultaneously. Obeying the rules for alternating turns just makes the game drag too much when players are trying to figure out how to play their hand because the other players' doing will most likely affect their decisions.

A short review after my first playthrough with 2 players:
The game's rules are easy to learn. Our game lasted for about 2 hours including reading the rules for the first time (we also removed more cards than intended from our draw pile). The rulebook is very comprehensive and we did not (yet) have any unanswered questions after our first session.

At first we thought the game was broken, as my GF's carnivores did not seem to do well against my defensive herbivores. After a few rounds the tides turned and I was close to getting extinct due to the same carnivores. We did not get much further than 2 climate changes in either direction, as we both mainly used neutral or single-climate-icon cards to add to the feeding pool. I guess in a 3 or more player game, you would experience more of the extreme climates as well. In fact, we only triggered one climate event due to our static weather :)

I feel this game is going to become one of our top games for 3 or more players. I would need to replay it with just the both of us to see if it'll have good replayability with just 2 players. 

The cards are of great quality and the illustrations are superb. The game truly revolves around evolving, it's spot on thematic- and gameplay-wise. It also feels quite unique in terms of gameplay, I can't really compare it directly to other games, which is good!

I'm going to give this an 8.5 to start with, I'll update it once I've play it a few more times.

This is one of my top 5 games out of about 75 right now.  It's so amazing.  Just enough take-that to balance off those who get lucky or just go for straight engine building.  Prevents the snowball mechanic in engine building games quite nicely while also not having to throw your own game away to knock someone down.  Think of it like the person in Catan that got super lucky dice rolls, getting a robber each turn on one tile, still winnable, but more balanced.  

Prevents passive players from winning which is good, those that always just boost population to 6 and try to just maximize points vs. adapting strategy each round to what is around them.

Excellent game after 10+ plays.  And if the "evolution" theme turns you off, remember it's you designing your species (hopefully intelligently).  And if real climate change consequences turns you off....maybe you should just go to a Trump rally and chant "lock her up" like a tool instead of playing this game.

The theming of this is excellent, and I was very unsure if a card game was the best way of doing an evolution game but man it WORKS. This is my 'direct player interaction' game of choice. It can be a war game for those who want that, it can be an economic engine game for those who want that. Every card is only good in certain circumstances, with the exception of 'cooperation' which is too good imo. I play instead with the 'insectivore' promo in its place.

Easy to teach.  Maybe 15 min.  The theme comes through very nicely in this game.  You find yourself adapting in order to survive.  If not from the weather, then from your daughter and friend who turned carnivore and is set to devour any new species your create. =/

Played once so far, with six.

I had read about this game that it was started as an educational game and then, over several iterations, turned into more of a game. I feel like a few more iterations could be used.

It feels like they are trying to keep things simple - e.g., making everything Carnivore vs. Non - but that they haven't yet achieved a level of simplicity that makes it appealing for repeat play by a group. Instead, it leaves them with somewhat clunky mechanisms that are too broad to balance each other out nicely.

While being played, it feels quite a bit like one of those euros where you're just fiddling around with things on your own personal player board and nothing else that anyone does has much bearing on you. Maybe with fewer players you would be able to target your opponent to mess them over, but with six players, the climate and feeding pool are both pretty static. I suspect, with fewer players, it would still feel like the interaction of screwing over other players' species via the climate and available food would still be so passive aggressive that it wouldn't really feel like a game that you are playing with other individuals, just a giant mechanical fist that punches you every once in a while based on the vote of some secret consortium.

It didn't suck. I might recommend it as a two player game, though I'd probably recommend a game like Magic or Gloom instead. With more than that, maybe Mashup or Gloom.

I must say that I definitely think I prefer this with the climate change and would give a lower rating to the base game. That said it has more RPG elements than many RPG's and it does it in such a simple relate-able way that you don't realize it. And while not educational, everything make thematic sense which helps tremendously in formulating strategies.

Evolution is my favorite game in my collection right now so this was clearly a must buy for me :D I tried the game twice at Essen Spiel 2016. Love the new cards, however we didn't really see the effect of the Weather event cards that much.
I bought the conversion kit anyway and tried it with my gaming group. People who was not the fan of the game loved the game this time. We had a few weather event cards triggered but the food affection buy weather really changed the game. It effected bit by bit but really changed the game :) Highly recommend even if you never tried the base game before

Played 2 times.Nice extra cards and ideas, having 4 traits per species makes for a more (complex) strategic-ish game (although in the end it is down to the luck of the draw). The climate part seems cool and can to a certain point make a difference, but my short  experience showed that there weren’t that many times when the climate made such an impactful difference. In the end, you need to try it if you like the base game, but you can easily get by without  ver having played it in my opinion.

I'm looking at my hand. Should I go carnivore? All the species next to mine seem to have evolved either climbing or burrowing. Food at the watering hole also seems to be on the decline... but one more tick up the climate tracker would get painful for a large predator as well. Go Pack Hunting with body size one and population six? Or just keep wallowing in the mud while the next extinction event sweeps the board clean?

Much better than I expected.

This is a competitive strategic card game in the same vein as Chudyk. No, its dynamic range isn't as wide as something like Innovation or Mottainai. But it does seem like a game with both strong tactical and strategic considerations informed by your opening hand, and then being molded by future card draws.

More than those other games, Evolution: Climate emphasizes bluff and doublethink. In both the "food choosing" and "trait choosing" phases, you have to take into consideration what the other player wants to do. I'm not a big fan of this dynamic when the potential choices are wide open (a la Netrunner), but I'm okay with them when they are more contained (a la Race for the Galaxy). This seems to be more like the latter.

Some concerns that the player count is a problem. With two, you miss out on some compelling gameplay around mutual benefit (climate change) and leeching (scavenger trait). But with more than that, the direct confrontation via the carnivore trait might be unfun. I'm leaning towards two players being optimal, and perhaps even drafting decks.

Very interesting concepts. However, I felt like this needed a little something to put it over the top. Perhaps the Flight expansion would help. I know there are other implementations of this game. I might prefer one of those better if I have the chance to play them. I felt like the game presentation needs more than just cards. It doesn't seem to scale well either.

Improves on the original by adding in the hot/cold climate effects and events. Also you now get an extra card each round! That small change does help with the "swingyness" of the original but this is still a game where being dealt a bad hand early on can really set you back and there's just nothing you can do about it.

The Climate aspect adds a lot to the strategy of Evolution which was already a great game. This stand alone game is a bigger and more complete gaming experience than the original. I only wish you could play Flight with it without having to take out the flight cards. Still, it is a great new Evolution game that was well worth it even though I already own The Beginning and Flight. We choose which to play like choosing ice cream... vanilla with sprinkles or chocolate? Can't go wrong.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Nice "species-engine-builder" hand-management card-based game with a little push your luck aspect, where you try to adapt your species tableau to the ever changing environment.
++ Great theme (evolution) that is really well-blended with gameplay mechanisms and the traits' abilities (almost everything can be thematically explained).
++ The addition of the climate track add a really cool 3rd layer to the Evolution game system that make this game better (now player must protect their species from food availability, carnivore and climate).
++ The addition of the climate Events add a little more chaos in higher player count games, but better strategies at the 2-players count (where the control of the climate track is more deterministic), and is also really thematic as climate shift are not always linear.
++ Gorgeous watercolor painting artwork that show mostly unreal animals to let our imagination tell the story of our creations.
++ Great game insert which hold everything in an orderly fashion.
++ Fun, fast to set-up and relatively fast to play card game.
++ There are expansions (promo traits, scenarios, plant mini expansion, etc.) available for this game (which is useful to refresh the game when we have overplayed it), and all these little changes can  change the game enough, so it offer a lot of replayability.
++ The Scenario Cards really make the 2-player game more dynamics and thus fun to play (especially the scenario affecting the climate, since the climate is less changing in a 2-player game).
++ The promo traits are fun to play with and changes the available strategies during that game (We play that we simply add one set of promo traits at a time, without removing anything).


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- This game is mean, as it feature direct player interaction (which is thematically accurate as evolution is survival of the fittest) and this may turn off some players. So players must be aware of this prior playing this game (like my wife as we tend to not like game that are too mean to each other).
-- Although this game as some engine-building aspect to it, we never really run an efficient engine, or just for a turn or two, as our "eating engine" will be either destroyed by our opponents or we will have to rip it apart to adapt the the new environnement. This give me a little less satisfaction.
-- Although the basic rules for this game are fairly simple, this game is still heavier than the BGG rating seem to suggest (2.8 at the time of this writing) as it become really demanding for newer players to manage several species with all the interaction between traits. This is because there are a lot of different combos and interaction subtleties that players need to learn by playing the game a few time to get their head around, even though almost everything make thematic sense.
-- For an unknown reason, I have a hard time to keep the flow of the game steady, always forgetting which steps must be done in which order, thus always referring to the rule book. It would have been cool to have a little summary printed on the Watering Hole/Climate Track (or an extra card).
-- It take a lot of table space, so it's hard to play this game beyond 4 players on a normal kitchen table.
-- Cards are somewhat thin for a card-based game. I would have prefer a better cardstock, but this doesn't matter much because I sleeved this game (because we can introduce a lot of promo traits from time to time and I wanted that all cards to stay mint).
-- The Climate track doesn't move enough (for our taste) at the 2-player count, and it's really too predictable. We will probably work out a variant for this (I think a 6d die with the climate icons on it could easily emulate a 3rd player to add some randomness and to make sure the climate marker moves more). Some Scenario Cards that affect the climate marker movement solve this issue.
-- The replayability in this game is dependent on the players trying different strategies depending on how the cards show up, hoe the climate change and how othe relayer adapt to all this. So at the 2-player count, when always facing the same opponent, it can become quickly "always the same".

Some phases of the game can be played simultaneously.  This removes some strategy, but increases game speed.

Can be simplified back to non-expanded Evolution by removal of certain cards from the deck and ignoring certain text in the game.  This is useful for new players.

Need just over 200 Mayday Green sleeves.

Based on 1 play with 2 players:

Seems like there is no reason to go back to base Evolution, even for new players. The Climate additions are simple enough and it adds a nice extra dimension to decisions (and, for the clever player, interactivity). Still one of my favorite gateway-level games.

Played with 6 and the quick play variant.  Everyone had a blast, the game moves quickly, there is plenty of direct and indirect interaction, and the theme and mechanics blend together wonderfully.  My only complaint was the climate board didn't have as much of a thematic effect as I had hoped (one game it just stayed within one step of temperate the whole time, the other one the event deck put a bunch of cold snaps on the warm side!), but that is a minor complaint - this one was  big hit.

Got it on Kickstarter. I'm a major fan of Evolution base game. The Flight and Climate expansions haven't been as strong for me. 

I will need to play more rounds with a variety of players before I commit to the rating of 7. 

One potential downer: It felt like the climate factor didn't have a significant impact because it took too long to move the climate marker up or down. 

Potential house rule modifier:  climate can move hot or cold up to 2 due if the difference between the played cards is 2 or more.

Update:  Have played a few times, including the house rule mentioned.  It feels like I want the game to be better than it is.  The mechanisms just don't impact the game in a way that is a good as the base game or Flight.

Played it with 2 and 6 players so far. I wouldn't play it with 6 again, it's to hard to keep track of everyone's traits, plus the quick mode variant that's required here takes away from the strategy. Really good with 2.
I have yet to trigger any of the climate events, so far the climate tracker always stayed near the middle.

RATING: 6
Current thoughts: I really want to like this game, but I suspect I'd need a group which played it a lot in order for its more interesting dynamics to come to the fore.

Prior thoughts: One game in, I liked the climate factor. Two games in, I'm finding that managing climate risk is making it difficult for me - and even more for first-time players - to focus on what the other players at the table are doing, which in turn makes it harder for folks to learn the core adaptation-to-other players that's needed to play decently.

Or in other words: now newer players can get wiped off the map by misestimating carnivore dynamics [i]or[/i] by misestimating climate dynamics. This may be more strategic, but I know at least one gamer who's been utterly turned off by it due to the perception of arbitrary, un-fun hammering. It probably wasn't arbitrary... but that doesn't change that he didn't have fun.

Also, with new players, playing sequentially is much slower, but playing simultaneously makes them more likely to misestimate carnivore dynamics.

Develop new species, give them specific traits by means of cards, or play the cards to make each individual animal of a species larger or to increase the number of a particular species. Make sure you can feed all your species, by putting a card at the watering hole. The same card will also influence the climate, and this in turn has a bearing on the abundance of plants (food) and the survival of your species. You can also develop carnivores, which feed on other players' species (or your own if necessary). Points are the sum of the trait cards attached to your surviving species, the population of these species, and the food collected during the entire game.

Much like nature this game finds its legs and success by its ability to adapt. The ever changing landscape of your fellow players' species and the climate means every turn you are judging how you should change to win. The game can be as aggressive or passive as the players want it to be. Very variable experience that plays in a good amount of time.

A well thought out indie game that is almost pure strategy, on an uncommon theme - building up one or more species, giving them traits, feeding them.

Climate is my favorite design that I've ever worked on by a good margin.  If I am ever blessed with being able to help collaborate on a masterpiece before I die, this will probably be it.  Everything about it runs like a well oiled machine.

The art that Catherine Hamilton is doing for this game is is spectacular.  The cover is one of my favorite pieces of art I've ever come across.  Not just out of board game art, but out of anything I've ever seen.  My co-workers say that I have a love affair with it because they keep catching me gazing at it when I should be working.  :-)

This is one of those board games where you just like to slide off the shelf, look at the artwork, open it up, check out the components and imagine yourself playing. The artwork in this game is absolutely amazing! Also, the game is great fun and has that realistic theme that I dig. Should I build a carnivore to devour my opponents or, should I create giant herbivores to consume all of the food in the watering hole?

If you have not played Evolution before give it a go... unless, you know, for some reason, you find the very thought of evolution theory preposterous and irreligious...in that case, go play Biblios.

It has been a few years since I played the original Evolution, and I can honestly say, this felt exactly the same. Tacking on a event effects to your food cards didn't really add or subtract from the game experience (though if asked to choose, I'd get rid of it). With several players it is really hard to predict their impact on things, and if the weather oscillates back and forth a few times, there are not enough turns in the game to see any major shift in weather.

My original annoyance of the game still held true, not being able to take in all the card effects on the cards from across the table. You would have to know the game quite well to make sense of things with a glance (similar to Le Havre).

I would of given the game a 5, but the thematic execution gets a 1 point nod.

Kickstarter.  I'm struggling a bit to get my arms around whether or not I think this adds to or takes away from the base game [Thing=155703][/Thing].  

On the one hand, I like the ability to really cycle through enough cards so that you aren't necessarily at the mercy of the draw.  But on the other, it now almost feels a little bit too diluted.  And the climate (event) track itself seems to not really matter a whole lot. 

My rating is tentative for now, subject to more plays, player counts, etc.

In Evolution: Climate you play as a ruthless god trying to intelligently design a set of minions so that they stuff themselves with food while at the same time attempting to devour, starve, freeze to death, or kill-off in natural disasters those belonging to rival gods.

Now, seriously, this game's theme is wonderfully and carefully realized, and the watercolor art is gorgeous. The mechanics really help bring interesting ecosystems to life, and you will be surprised with the dynamics that are set in motion. For example, in my second play, I made one of my species carnivore thinking that it would give me an advantage to eat my friends' animals. It did help me, but it was very cool to see how my "evil" intentions actually helped everyone by reducing the pressure on the food supply and by allowing more species to thrive if they became scavengers.

While seeming like a cute and friendly game on the outside, I have felt in my limited experience that it has a lot of potential for cutthroat play. There is a general atmosphere of "let's all contribute to favorable weather and plentiful food," but I often wondered if my species would come off on top if I tried to make the temperature unbearable or the food scarce. And I believe this gets much worse with lower player counts. Also, compound this kind of available strategies with an already large pool of options and you might end up with a heavy and AP-ridden experience. (Tip: using the suggested "quick play" mode, in which all players play cards at the same time, can really reduce down-time.)

As the result of an "edutainment" project, I think this game greatly succeeds in being fun while also sparking conversations about its underlying science. For me it was questioning what is the right way of thinking about evolution: how much can we really say competition is at the heart of ecosystem development? Both on the tabletop and in real life, wouldn't it also be interesting if this game was a cooperative one?

The base is an interesting exercise in point-optimization through the meta-game. This though adds that extra dimension that really forces players to pay attention to what other players want.
The card discarded to add food to the watering hole seemed a very binary, nearly automatic choice, based upon whether you collected food from the watering hole or not in the original game... Climate adds in the climate track which must be considered additionally on all cards discarded. The value of cards becomes significantly more interesting as threats of carnivores, climate, and hunger all bare down on all species every round.

I really enjoy the added depth that the climate track adds. It's not intrusive, but makes the otherwise straightforward choice of how much food to get into the watering hole a more interesting one. It seems too hard to get to the more extreme temperatures though and in our games we barely have any events, which is a bit disappointing.

My god is this game boring. Get a hand of cards to either bump up your species stats (body size for offense/defense and population for food which is the VP in the game), start a new species, or play on an existing species. One card also goes on the food pile to dictate how much food there is that round. Then, one by one, players take food per population of their species. If a species can't be fed, it loses population and possibly dies off. Winner at the end is the player with the most food. This game could be better if the cards were actually fun but there is something that protects against everything so most of the time, you just sit there going, "Ok, that had no effect on me."

I like the base game aswell as the original card game, so what does this one bring to the mix?

The game is nearly the same, with a few new ideas thrown in. While I'm not that impressed by the disaster cards, the thematic idea is great. The whole climate thing however is kinda neat, but not necassary in my eyes. 

I think I like the base game better, but they are pretty much on par. This one is just slighty different, but it adds a little bit chaos to the game, hence I'll stick to the base game.

RATING: 8
Everything about this game is terrific in my opinion, from the art to the theme to the gameplay. The theme of the game is so well integrated that one really feels like they are trying to guide their species through a variety of evolutionary pressures. 

I love games with lots of mind games and bluffing, and Evolution fits the bill. For example, you can remove a predator trait card and replace it with another, face-down. Your opponent then has to decide whether you are actually switching the species to herbivore or are just trying to fool them. Or, for example, if your opponent is relentlessly increasing body size. Are they planning to eat your species or is it climate-related or is it just a bluff?

Along those lines, the climate track is fantastic as well, and adds a whole other level of interaction. To be honest I think the climate aspect really makes the game for me. Plus it is absolutely perfect in a thematic sense.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
While [thing=176173][/thing] adds a new trait and some expanded choices, this expansion really adds more. The climate track will penalize species which are not well adapted to the weather and will affect the amount of food available. Players can affect the track when they put down food cards and by playing an event card.

That climate track becomes the focus of the game, suddenly. It's not just about how the species interact, but also how to manipulate the environment to suit your species best and your opponent's species least.

Although more complex than the original Evolution, the climate mechanic adds more thematic cards and interactions. Body size becomes more important than merely warding off predators. The complexity does not raise this game beyond the starting point but adds so much theme. 

The game still plays as smooth as the original and the artwork remains similarly top-notch.

Love this game! The colour, theme, and gameplay is great. It only doesn't get a 10 because the board does not fit perfectly and warps. I know you can buy a mat as an extension instead, but I would have loved a nice soft mat in the box instead of the cardboard pieces.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.9
I played this game with 3 players and thought it went well with our player count.

In Climate, there is a climate track that shows how hot or cold the world's climate is. Each round, it may be nudged one step towards hotter or colder depending on what cards each player throws out of their hand. At the extreme temperatures, either big (if hot) or small (if cold) species take a hit to their population--possibly being wiped out. At most climate levels there is also some effect on the amount of food available.
There is also a face-up hot and cold climate event that is triggered when the climate becomes whatever is listed on the card. While these spice up the climate track, they add a stressing level of chaos to what could happen. I'm not sure if I really like them yet or not.

There are new trait cards which relate to the climate that are neat. Also each species can hold up to 4 trait cards each, and each trait card is worth a point at the end of the game as one of the scoring mechanisms. I love the trait cards how they can layer on top of each other.

Not sure if I'd like the game with 5-6 players. We ended up with each player having 3-5 species by the end of the game, most with 3-4 traits each. Wasn't too bad to keep track of with 3 players but with 5-6 I think I would be a bit stressed.

Gorgeous art, and a really fun game. Patience is required to learn the various traits and how they interact with other species and climates. A very rewarding game once you are familiar with the traits.

First impression upon opening and punching; the components are mostly great. Everything feels quality except the cards, which are fairly thin. The box is probably 40% larger than it needs to be. The board is also scuffed slightly from shipping and bouncing around in the box. Not enough to bother with, but it's there. Bags, start player token, board, and food tokens are beautiful. Will update with opinions when played.

2017-04-05 - This is just an expanded Evolution, so it was likely that I would enjoy it. The new traits that the expansion adds are interesting.

That is obviously group think, so the expansion could still bring some interesting wrinkles. We'll see.

A really fun game with great atmosphere. Complexity also easily scalable with Climate cards and Scenario cards. Have had loads of fun with several different groups.

When I played the original Evolution last year, the game explainer did a terrible job, and I hated that game. But my friend won a copy of this, and I went ahead and tried it. It went better with this game than the original, I believe mostly due to a much better game explanation than when I played the original.

Being someone whp believes in intellegent design, I have never liked this theme. But the game itself does not state that evolution is fact. So I'm going to borrow a page from Richard Ham, rahdo himself, to rate this game. In his video for Kings of Israel, rahdo says that as an atheist, he treats the biblical theme in Kings of Israel as a mythology. So thats what I'm going to do for this game, treating the theme as a mythology.

Will I ever own it? No, but if someone at my buddies house wants to play his copy, I'll play it.

Love it! I played the older version (including Flight) with four and it was great. Played the newer one (no Flight) with two and it was great. The game plays very differently with two than it does with four because you can focus more easily in what opponent is doing and try to counter it. More players makes the game a little more chaotic as you're never sure what everyone is doing.

The rules and gameplay are simple but the strategy is deep. I love this in a game. The theme really comes through, perhaps more than any other game. Evolving or adapting to what other players or the climate is doing feels very true to the real world.

I'd happily play this anytime!

At first sight The Evolution seems like just another pro-educational-wannabe boardgame. The design is candy, rules are very simple and the first player token is rather infantile. 
Don’t get confused by the age range on the box. I’m sure you will find it enjoyable and fun to play... Even when in first round your only population of tree-climbing hedgehogs became a snack to another player’s carnovore species. 
I have to forgive this game’s merciless climate events and want play it all over again

Please, if you teach this game to someone, make sure that they fully understand the pros and cons of having a carnivore vs. a plant eater, and make sure they fully understand the rules and nuances of the game-i.e. you can keep cards, carnivores must be a larger body size than what they want to eat, etc.

It's better than the original Evolution because there is another layer added, but it's still basically the same game. Unfortunately, in our first game only 1 climate event happened and life was really hard for predators (because with 4 trait cards it is easy to make strong protections). I would definitely like to explore this game even more. It's a neat experience even if you do not win. Furthermore, the art is again excellent and now the game is even more thematic.

RATING: 9
This game is in th category of games with special powers, a strong background setting that varies throughout the game (the climate), and victory points (instead of life points like in Magic). 

The special powers are flavorful and varied. There are not many o them, though: it is quite easy to know what power you would like to have (like climbing if you are a carnivore against a climbing species). Corner cases were covered in the rule book, when i needed to check. 

The rules are simple, streamlined and clean, as are the various powers. The integration between mechanics and theme is very strong. 

The production quality is good. I love the drawings. Too bad that the extra power cards do not have the same style. 

Overall, this is a very well designed game, an obvious quality work. 

Now, I only wonder whether this game would wear down on me: the powers are flavorful but there are not many of them, and we don’t use many at a time (even though we can easily rotate them). 

I had a great time playing: the surprises of the effect on food and climate of the waterhole tiles, each turn, is great; the powers make a lot of  thematic sense; there is a significant but partially random « take that » interaction that elicit bouts of schadenfreude,… We laughed a lot when our species were wiped out. The variable climate adds a very good layer of « background playing conditions » that almost creates different games depending on the temperature and vegetation. Obviously a very good piece of work.

RATING: 5
Climate adds a bunch of new traits to Evolution, as well as a climate track, which can be theoretically manipulated. Playing with four players, the climate track is more or less a crapshoot you just deal with, and in our game neither of the climate events happened. The climate track just didn't seem to add much except a ton of food, as it was parked on Temperate most of the game. 

The new traits aren't bad, though most of them are geared toward dealing with the climate changes. 

I guess if you're an Evolution die-hard this might be one to get but I didn't feel it was a huge change from vanilla Evolution.

The game is enjoyable, but there is too much randomness. Not knowing the actions other players have taken in a given turn is a good addition to strategy. However, the additional change in climate and associated actions are also unknowns and makes it unenjoyable for me since you can't strategize for every scenario. I think it's a fun game to play every once in a while, but not a favorite.

Managed to play a few games of Evolution.  To say the least, I feel like Evolution: Climate is one of the most balanced games I have ever played.  After playing it for about 10 times, I have still yet to see any sort of "dominant" strategy or predictable paths.  Every game feels dynamic because not all of the traits are available and the Climate can shift depending on each player's strategy on the table.

My only major complaint I have about the game it is can be far more unforgiving for new players.  Keeping your species alive is a more difficult challenge than the base game because the Climate can easily dwindle down the food supply.

If you are interested in getting this game, get the Evolution: Climate stand-alone.  The base game is obsolete because of this expansion.

Good game! The rules are simple enough that 10 year old kids can understand them. But in this case it's not your average family game.

I bet if this was a fantasy flight game it would have been riddled with counters and a rulebook full of little exceptions and special rules. But in this game it's a smooth design, with very thematic rules and cards that make sense. I like the overall look and feel of the game as well.

So far everyone I've played this with enjoyed this very much.

RATING: 9
Highly interactive, reactive card game.  The heights of hand-management... so many ways to use each card, and all of them depending on what your opponents are doing.  I went into the game expecting to enjoy the building of a species with cool complementing traits, but what I didn't expect was the mind games that come from the set-up phase and the hidden assigning of traits to species.  "Did she just beef up her body size to protect herself, or is she about to turn carnivore?"  The climate expansion adds even more traits and set-up variability, which makes every game feel different.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A great strategy/tactical card game.

There are many ways to play and counter moves by the other players in the ecosystem.

Going carnivore isn't always the best strategy. The Climate expansion is a great way to add more depth to the strategy without fundamentally changing the game play.

Gifted this to my sister this year and we played a number of times during the holiday.  Potentially very vicious game with a lot of destruction, or in this case consumption, of the other players' species.  Plus I enjoy the idea of playing to the climate changes.  

Played 5 or 6 times and didn't win once, but enjoyed it the whole time.

Meh. I think this was the final nail in the coffin for me when it comes to Evolution. I enjoyed the base game, thought Flight was okay, but Climate takes this game from being a fairly breezy experience to one that is tight and unforgiving for everyone. One person can throw off the balance of the whole game by throwing in a card that makes the temperature rise or fall noticeably, and early on this can wipe out a bunch of species right away. I don't mind this in games normally, but I guess it was just a little jarring for me when a game wasn't that way to begin with. If you wanted Evolution to be more of a gamer's game, however, this might be worth seeking out.

Felt like we should have been drafting the cards. Drawing copies of the same half dozen cards consistently seems to put to behind a turn as you discard them to get others. Drawing a hand of all the same card also feels pretty lame. No events triggered in our game, I'm sure this game was a statistical flyer but not terribly interested in another play.

*Review of the Conversion kit for the original game*
This takes 'Evolution' up to a 9 for me. I love the new climate board and how manipulating it can be used to facilitate the same function as the trait cards: playing passively, defensively, or offensively. I wish there were the same number of new player references to replace all the old ones. Also, the colouration on the backs of the Climate trait cards are slightly different than the original game, so card marking is possible.

Both Evolution and Evolution: Climate are masterpieces. Everything I want in a family gaming experience. I’m giving both games a 10. 

I think they both deserve the same rating because I view one as just a variation of the other. Climate is the game to play when you want the added layer of complexity and strategy, but I’ll gladly play either version anytime.

[b]Evolution: Climate[/b] was acquired in a math trade (1/21/18).

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]This new spin off of Evolution adds a climate track to the game which adds another element of danger your species need to contend with. Now your species can suffer losses not only by carnivore attacks, but also the climate itself and the climate event cards that get triggered. There are also a bunch of new trait cards which really open up the game and offer more ways to build species as opposed to Evolution. 

Unfortunately I still have the same problem with Evolution Climate that I did with Evolution, I don't think it scales well with two players, the game feels too loose and lacks real tension. We also found Carnivores felt under-powered in the two player game and this ends up removing most of the tension from the game. Since we would primarily play with two I won't be keeping my copy. I also don't have any interest in playing with more players because keeping track of everyone's different species would be almost intolerable; just trying to see what one player has was enough of a hassle. I'm still content to play Evolution: The Beginning if I want an Evolution fix.[/i]

心得:
其實跟小盒版蠻像的
只是多了些限制讓遊戲策略了一點
但是主要互動還是跟其他玩家間的心理博奕跟運氣
如何快速組出強大的物種來每輪吃食物計分是重點
氣候增加了額外需要考量的要素
讓遊戲有翻盤的機會
規則:
*使用對應玩家人數面圖版，氣候標記放在氣候軌溫和格，卡牌洗勻2/3/4人移除88/60/30張，洗勻15張冷氣候卡放在圖板左下，開一張放到對應氣候軌下方，熱氣候卡一樣洗勻放右下開一張放在對應氣候軌下
*每人拿一個袋子，隨機起始拿起始標記，
*遊戲進行5~7輪，每輪有5個階段
1.發卡  每個沒有物種板塊的玩家拿一個圖板並放置一個數量跟體型標記在第一格，每人發四張牌在每個物種板塊額外一張，當牌發完棄牌洗勻(或用一開始移除的牌)再發，此輪為最後一輪
2.選食物卡  每人蓋著出一張卡到圖板中央，右下代表食物數量，天氣標誌會影響氣候軌
3.出卡 玩家輪流出牌，一次出完蓋著出，保留幾張都可以，牌出在物種板塊前面，玩家不出牌後可將任意張數牌放到牌庫底再抽等量張數，所有玩家都出完後在一起打開
*一個物種不能有一樣的特徵卡，不能超過四張特徵卡，可移除
>可棄一張特徵卡來增加物種，拿一個新的物種板塊並放置體型跟數量標記，該圖版只能放在就有的左邊或右邊
>可棄一張來增加體型或數量一格
4.改變環境   打開所有中央食物卡，根據總和移動氣候軌，如果此時停留的位置有卡片則結算，之後放到對應牌庫底，氣候軌上顯示對應的體型大小物種數量減上面符號數量，之後放對應食物在中間根據氣候軌增減總和，並補對應的氣候卡一張
*綠色卡牌在打開食物卡前有效果，任意順序啟動
*對抗氣候的特徵效果可疊加
5.餵養 從起始玩家開始輪流從中間拿食物放物種板塊前面，只能拿到等同該物種的數量，肉食動物則要攻擊別的物種，只能攻擊體型比較小的，被攻擊的數量減一(之前吃的食物不會掉)，肉食動物從肉食供應區拿等同目標體型的數量食物放，此階段結束後所有沒食物的數量失去，所有吃到的食物丟袋中，之後起始標記左傳
*肉食動物一定不吃素
*當有一個物種失去最後一個數量時，棄掉所有特徵卡並抽對應張數卡片，面前的食物丟袋中，如果是兩個物種中間，將兩個物種靠攏
*遊戲最後算分，每個食物一分，每個物種分數等於其數量，每個特徵卡一分，平手比特徵卡分數在比數量分數
***變體***
*不使用氣候事件卡
*出牌階段改成一起出，6人遊戲時要使用
*2人遊戲時每個物種特徵卡上限只有三張

RATING: 8
The Climate Track makes choosing the food card each round a little more interesting. You have to balance the direct amount of food with the potential for climate change (positive or negative.) If you have planned for one extreme or the other, pushing the climate in that direction can indirectly harm your opponents.

Too much direct conflict for me. If I am going to play I do prefer the Climate expansion as it adds some randomness that adds some humor to the game.

I enjoyed this expansion/conversion from the base game.  The climate mechanism gave more importance to body size outside of carnivore and a few cards.  I liked how to plan the weather and play that vs your opponents.  The new cards seemed decent.  It seemed easier to integrate into the game.

We only hit one climate event, despite the two decks of cards.  The extra climate rules can be swingy and more punishing for newer players.

RATING: 9
Etant passionné de paléontologie, j'ai tiqué sur ce jeu lorsque j'ai appris son existence. Evolution est en effet un jeu où vous devez prendre le contrôle d'une ou plusieurs espèces animales, et les faire évoluer en leur attribuant des traits de caractère spécifiques.

Je ne vais pas m'éterniser sur les règles du jeu, amplement décrites sur ce site. Je vais néanmoins faire une remarque : j'ai été surpris de voir un jeu qui exploite aussi bien le thème de l'Evolution. En fait, il exploite tellement bien ce thème qu'il en est pédagogique. En effet, les règles mêmes du jeu reproduisent des mécanismes biologiques réalistes. Je m'explique par un exemple. Dans Evolution : Climate, le climat influence la quantité de nourriture végétale disponible pour les herbivores. Si les joueurs produisent trop d'espèces herbivores différentes, avec pour chacune d'elles une population trop élevée, une partie de leur population mourra faute de nourriture, ne laissant alors que les espèces ayant des caractéristiques qui leur permettent de passer outre cette pénurie (en hibernant par exemple). Autrement dit, face à une évolution du climat, les espèces qui nécessitent trop de nourriture pour survivre disparaîtront, et ne survivent que les espèces adaptées. C'est donc une illustration concrète - et ludique - de la Sélection Naturelle et ce jeu de société est un excellent outil pour expliquer cette théorie de façon amusante à des enfants.

D'autres règles plus complexes mais tout aussi réalistes sont présentes et encrent encore plus le jeu dans son thème. D'une façon générale, la plupart des règles du jeu illustrent le fonctionnement biologique des mammifères. Ainsi, un climat chaud favorisera les animaux de petite taille, et un climat froid favorisera les animaux de plus grande taille (comme c'est le cas pour les mammifères). De même, un animal herbivore peut devenir carnivore, mais l'inverse n'est pas possible (tout comme dans la réalité, pour les mammifères encore une fois).

Ce jeu respecte donc son thème à la lettre et l'exploite de façon magistrale, mais le thème du jeu ne fait pas tout. Evolution : Climate est un jeu qui reste très simple d'accès (y compris dans sa version anglaise) et est très stratégique, d'autant plus que les sessions de jeu sont relativement courtes (entre 30 min et 1H pour une partie à 4 joueurs).

Même si j'adore ce jeu, je lui connais tout de même quelques défauts :
- Disponible uniquement en version anglaise, ce qui est dommage.
- Les illustrations sont constituées d'aquarelles. Les couleurs utilisées par ces illustrations sont difficiles à voir pour les daltoniens.
- L'extension "Flight", qui permet de créer des animaux volant, n'est pas compatible avec cette version du jeu (Evolution : Climate)

This is a lot of fun, and thematically a lot of the powers' interactions is great. Sometimes you don't draw the trait card you really need to and are forced to try and adapt to the situation at hand. Seems like the luck of the draw can mess with your ability to influence events as you'd like to, particularly the climate track. Outside of that, this is a really fun game. Further plays have made me up this to an 8. There is emergent strategy in this one, that takes quite a while to unearth. Gets better with more plays.

This game is simply stunning. The vibrant watercolors make the game shine, and the theme comes across phenomenally well. While some may not enjoy the cutthroat nature, I feel like predators are a vital part of gameplay. You must adapt your species, whether to predators or climate, or die. Though we didn't push the climate too much our first game, I can tell that's going to be a great mechanic to explore. I love how many traits exist, and how many permutations are possible. This is one of those games that I kept thinking about after I put it away. Now all I'm wondering is when I can play it again.

Bit of a disappointment. Never been a big fan of games where card combos are the central mechanic (sort of like Magic:TG) and I found this one on the one hand a bit straightforward and dull as you try to create herbivores that eat a lot, and then frustrating once you have carnivores and you find yourself spending a good time just figuiring out who you can eat. This was painful with 5-6 players.

The Climate Change track didn't trigger enough to make it interesting, and I could never really be bothered keeping track of everyone's traits. Perhaps it'd be a better two player game? It's quick and colourful and others seem to enjoy it so at the moment I won't sell it on, but it's a close thing. I'll give it a few more games.

I have enjoyed this game a great deal.  I do think it plays better with fewer players.  I'm not sure I'll play with more than 4 at this point.  2-3 is really quick and fun.  4 is decent.  Any more than 4 and there is a VERY high chance that the last player won't even get an opportunity to feed.

I've noticed a slight problem with a run away leader problem at higher player counts.  It's very difficult to mitigate the luck of bad cards at higher player counts too - mostly because you'll likely never feed at higher player counts.

The strategy in your play will need to literally evolve in this game.  Each round may require a new trait or feeding priority based on what is food is available, the other player's traits and climate conditions.

This game is so amazing just with the original gameplay. Then they add a new climate system which makes the game more difficult to play with but more realistic. Species have to endure the unbearable environment yet fight of the predators lurking around.
Great game indeed.

RATING: 8
Beneath the visually captivating exterior there is a solid card drafting game here--one which promotes smooth, interactive, and dynamic gameplay. At two-players, Evolution is a tense game of chicken: where both players are constantly aware of every change in body size and population, wondering when the next apex predator will emerge. The flexible choices in card design allow players to emulate their playstyle with success: be it a lumbering, untouchable herbivore, an opportune scavenger, or a bloodthirsty predator. The flexibilty really shines when you discover engine-building opportunities that allow species to cooperate for survival. 

Included in the "Climate" edition of Evolution are climate change cards that can throw a thematic wrench into best-laid plans: species big and small die off, or a sudden surplus/shortage in food supply occurs. Thankfully, you can anticipate the potential for change. The mult-use cards allow you to influence the climate shift, and certain traits can mitigate adverse climate effects. In the worst-case-extinction scenario, the game also provides an ingenious comeback mechanism, allowing you to draw a number of trait cards equivalent to the number of traits your lost species developed before they kicked the primordial bucket. 

At higher player counts, the game retains its low downtime, primarily due to the turn structure that promotes simulatneous play. A word on the near-unrivalved playtime to depth ratio: Whether with two players or with five, the game hums at a comfortable pace of an hour and some.  Hidden scoring also reduces over-analytic tendencies, and I think this aligns with the tone of the game. Presumably, you are aware who currently sits atop the food chain, but a hungry species is not constantly calculating the optimal move, but rather, the most opportune move. This is a sublime feat in thematic game design and I think no other title does this subject matter better justice.

(+) Highly interactive and dynamic gameplay. Adapt or perish.
(+) Flexible, yet straightforward card effects lead to interesting survival strategies .
(+) Pleasantly low downtime when playing simultaneously.

(-) Higher player count can really hamper the experience for the last person to feed in a round. The randomness is more noticeable and adverse here.
(-) Can have a runaway leader problem at higher player counts, as well.
(-) Accessibility barrier in terms of gameplay. Experienced players will know which cards to anticipate and combine, and wew players will likely be stumbling right out of the gate.

I like how simple yet strategic this game is. You can really put a lot of thought into "do I want to make the climate stink for my opponents while also building my species up to withstand the climate change?" or "should I be ready for if my wife tries to carnivore me?" haha. Its good! I also love the theme of Evolution, the struggle for survival of the fittest in the early days of the universe has always intrigued me. I also appreciate the Latin Naming Guide for your species they include, so you can have an extra bit of fun imagining this weird creature you created.

Evolution is a fun tableau building game about controlling the pace of the game while gorging yourself on as much food as possible. I like that you can adapt to a dwindling food supply by eating your opponents' species, or, in a pinch, even your own.

This is a clever tweaking of what was already a brilliant design.  Evolution manages to capture its subject matter entirely through its mechanics, is approachable enough to be played and played well by kids as young as six.  When we sit around watching nature documentaries, we inevitably begin a running discussion of where we see game elements in evidence.  This is easily the best family game I've played (though the carnivores have the potential to hurt feelings, so we often play in two-man teams to help protect each other).

Cool, cool theme. It's also simple and easy to pick up. I almost exclusively play 2 players or solo though, and I didn't find this game to be a compelling 2 player game. Climate was almost never an issue and only putting in two cards for food was too little (for me anyway). I am also too much of a care bear to really get into the cut-throat nature of this game. Good for certain groups, I think, just not for me!

Streamlined game that's easy to learn, it's all about predicting, influencing the system to your advantage and adapting your creatures based around the climate and other players creatures. I love that when you think it's going well and you've killed another player off (as a carnivore) you'll then struggle to eat and they can create some kind of freakish dominating carnivorous turtle and annihilate you, yet you can also predict this and adapt. You'll have to save some cards but you'll want to use them all to get points as soon as you can by increasing population, creating tension. The feeding system is also excellent and varies, you have a chance to contribute a lot of very little food every round and there are times you'll want to out more or less in. The artwork is absolutely beautiful I've never seen such a vibrant colour palette on a card game yet it absolutely looks like it belongs there.

VERY minor downsides - the rules for setting up a two player game were a little vague. Remove around half the deck. Which ones? There are 7 of each adaptation excluding carnivores so I removed 3 of each. It made for a fun and balanced game but think I'd remove four of each next time. This also hints at how versatile the game could be if introducing new trait cards but also at how it may become unbalanced if the wrong cards were taken out. A little more explanation of how to mix cards would have been helpful. The end of game condition should have been written in a much more obvious place so when browsing the rules one could have understood what happens and dived right into the game.

I love this game and think it's genius. I think that with more plays and a slightly higher player count it'd be even better. So glad I Kickstarted this amazing and beautiful game.

Makes the game way more interactive and chess-like. Carnivores are nice in the base game, but easy to defend and not really prevalent (in our experience). But manipulating the climate through collective card play is great mechanic, really changes up plays from session to session, and makes you think quickly and plan ahead more. And food shortages are more likely!

Evolution Climate is a stand-alone game that is essentially Evolution with a few design tweaks and a "Climate" expansion.

Cards now have climate symbols which push the temperature warmer or colder. More food is available when it is warmer, generally, and less when it is colder. The weather can kill off your populations unless you've got the right protection cards in play. Small animals fare better in the warm weather and larger animals fare better in colder weather. Additionally there are climatic events that can trigger (although none did in our game).

The expansion stuff is somewhat interesting but really didn't have much effect in our play. The box cover and feeding area feature new art and are quite beautiful. That alone would make me prefer this version to the original.

Evolution is definitely a game that requires a first play to know how to navigate and I found this play much better than my first foray into the game system.

It has a fairly steep learning curve for a game with rules this simple but that's because the game is quite deep. I love both theme and setting and the Climate Track is a great addition to the game.

Never played Evolution before, but really like this game. My first two player game of it felt very tense and balanced. It is just so interesting to discover impressive combo's in the trait cards, and then still have to change everything next turn because the climate changes or your opponent eats all the food before your turn. Oh, and the artwork and component quality of the game is really nice as well!

There was a lot going on in this game.  So many options and choices.  This feels very much like a game that you get better and better at and can win with a variety of strategies.  I like that in a game.  The climate portion seemed pretty cool, but didn't come into play a ton with my one time of playing, though it probably weighed on decisions throughout the game to not have it come into play.  Cool game.

My kids, 8 now, love playing this. They learned to play Evolution when they were 7. (They're not so fond of species going extinct.) The Climate expansion adds some fun new dynamics. We take turns playing through 3 variants (Evolution base game, Flight, and Climate) depending on what kind of mood they're in - each one has something special that makes it enjoyable in its own right. The strategy is easy to pick up yet provides lots of challenging play. Every game is unique. And yes, they regularly win.

Oct 2017: We've had this nearly a year and still only played twice.  So many better games in our collection - but I'm leaving the rating a 5.

Original:
It's an okay game, but just okay.  For whatever reason, was harder for new players to grasp than other games we have.  The climate can be a real challenge in some games while never posing a threat in others - would be nice to have a happy medium where it's always somewhat influential.

I'm really surprised how much this simple variation on the base game really ups the fun factor and interest for me.  More powers on animals, more pro's and con's to different play styles, the climate meter to battle over, I really enjoy this version where the original was kind of one-and-done for me.

The artwork in this game is incredible--I love the original watercolors, which evoke the theme of the game magnificently. In addition, the gameplay itself is extremely well done. The choices surrounding the development of each species are both entertaining and seamlessly integrated with the idea of a hypothetical real-world species adapting to its environment. My only (admittedly minor) quibble is that while the carnivore cards make perfect sense in the context of the game, the result is cutthroat enough that I would not see myself always champing at the bit to play the game. Nevertheless, the game is fantastic, and I can see us playing it many times over to see all of the possible trait combinations.

Compared to The Beginning this is a much tougher game, a gamer's game in a sense, but it keeps a very reasonable time and rhytm. 4 characters instead of three is a winner BUT it leads to a lot more confusion and AP. Climate is a game changer in the series, you really need to understand what's going to happen with it and drive it to your needs as much as you can.

[i]Climate[/i] has neat new traits to drag experienced evolutionaries out of their doldrums, including Hibernation, Noctural, and Migratory.  The climate track hasn't had a major impact on our games, as we typically regress to the mean and avoid triggering events.

I continue to be irritated by cooperation chains and the generally ineffective nature of carnivores - most species are inedible? - but those are minor aches and pains.  With the kickstarter promos, it's painless to swap out the irritants (Cooperation and certain defensive traits) for more interesting genetic flavors.

It is an ok game, it is really thematic and makes sense evolutionary speaking,  it didn't give me a refreshing feeling of enjoyment. Reminds me many other "combo" games so it is replaceable. The climate track it is quite useless at the end, it really depends if the players use it as part of their strategy, but nothing makes really mandatory to use it. So to speak, it is the same as the first version. For me it doesn't worth the money. Evolution the beginning is half the price and delivers quite the same feeling.

First impression: I didn't like it as much as Evolution or Evolution: Flight. In practice, as I suppose I should have expected, the climate just tends to waver a bit, mostly in the middle. This affects the food supply a little, making food more scarce, and the need for carnivore traits that much greater. If the event cards start out near the ends, or as in my first game, [b]at[/b] the ends, then they just don't trigger.

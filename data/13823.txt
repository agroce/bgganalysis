Really good filler. Just one game to grasp the rules (you can safely start with the advanced rules, they are far from complicated), and then your only problem is how to stop playing this fast, addictive little game. It's easy to play but not without offering interesting choices, a bit of randomness and a nice drafting system. Good with any number of players.

What's your game? version. Good quality. The iconography can be a bit obscure at first and the theme is not exactly an essential part of the game.

Comment based on first 3 plays with 2 players...
..really enjoyed playing.  Seems like there is a lot of depth for a fairly simple card game.  Cards interact really well and the design means there are multiple paths to score well, so a 'bad hand' is very unlikely.
Art is great.

Update: played 11 times now.  All two player (with 3 different people).  All of them have loved it. 2 player makes it quite a tight tactical memory game.  I'm really wanting to play it with more people though...

Upped rating from 7 to 8.

Way too abstract for me.  You are just collecting cards.  I like to think there's a goal (besides scoring points) at the end of the game.  Like you've built a city, or killed a dragon, or completed a trip through Europe, or baked a Pizza even.

I finally got to play Fairy Tale. It's a fast game completely around the well-known drafting mechanic. I definitely enjoyed it, but it felt a bit simplistic to me in the end. It's mathy too - which is not my favorite aspect to any game. All's forgiven because of the speed and simplicity, but not a game I'll long to play.

Just trying to decipher the cards drives me mad.

Fairy Tale offers plenty of room for cunning combos, clever tactics and creative strategies. I absolutely love card drafting as a mechanic. Choosing a card means that you have to let go of the others. Moreover, you have to pay attention to you fellow players since the cards you pass them is what they must choose from.

However, the graphic design of the game is just horrendous. You cannot even try to guess what each symbol means without a player aid, and after a couple of rounds the table is flooding with information you struggle to understand in the first place.

After a few games everything starts to make sense but in my opinion the hurdle is such that I would not want to be the one teaching the game.

Only played a couple of times. It's really more or less like 7 Wonders since it is only card drafting. I suppose it's more portable. It's also more complex than say, Sushi Go. There's also more player interaction. I guess there's some meat to it, but because I own the other two games, I'm not so inclined to own this. I think it's a good game, but I suppose I'd rather play the other two.

It's a game of hand management: a light version of [thing=68448][/thing].  You pass around a hand of cards, taking one card, passing it and receiving another, and you do this to build a hand of 5 cards.  You play 3 and discard the others and repeat.  Very quick.  Definitely a filler game of hand management.  Not bad.  Just not one you are going to suggest as the highlight of your game night, but fits the need for a 10 minute filler.  Problem is, 7 Wonders is a light game in its own right, and takes about the same time, so why get this when you can get that?

RATING: 7
I rather like this game.  The concepts and strategies are pretty simple.  Gameplay is straightforward.  Great filler since games are pretty quick.  I like the theme, too.

I have two criticisms.  First, the game is a little *too* simple.  It would be nice if there were more complex interactions or ways of scoring.  Second, I feel as if there are too few cards for interacting with your opponent.  Sure, there are a few demon (black) cards that mess with everyone, but not that many.  Maybe if there were a few more of those or some other way of interacting with your opponent's played cards.  Even with these, I strongly recommend giving this card game a shot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

I enjoy card drafting games like 7 Wonders and Sushi Go a lot and therefore I had heard of Fairy Tale before, but I've never got the opportunity to play it. Now that I did, I must say that I enjoyed as expected, but at the same time I was a little underwhelmed.

First of all, the graphic design is as messy as it can possibly be. The effects of the cards are very simple  most of the times, but the iconography is really counterintuitive. The artwork is nice, but it drowns in the ocean of weird symbols and icons that surrounds it. Gameplay-wise Fairy Tale presents a couple of interesting twists on the drafting genre in the form of the flipping mechanism and the whole "draft 5, choose 3" idea. I like the introduction of this simultaneous selection mechanism for the cards you actually keep, because it adds a new element to this well know recipe.

On the other hand, one of the reasons why I enjoy drafting games so much is the memory aspect of keeping in mind which cards are in the hands that are going around the table. I've always felt that this is where the skill in these games lies and unfortunately Fairy Tale diminishes this aspect a lot, by reducing the number of cards that you draft each turn. This brings my enjoyment of the game down quite a bit.

Overall Fairy Tale is a good game, that I would play again for sure... but at the same time I would rather play something like 7 Wonders or Sushi Go. Yet, even if it might not be as good as it's competitors, it's still good enough for a drafting game.

Fast, fun, addictive.  Sure, there's a good bit of luck -- and gambling.  But it takes ten minutes, there's enough strategy & tactics to be interesting, and it's a lot of fun.

The cardplay does become a bit too automatic once you really know the deck -- after, say, 20 games.  But then, you realize there are still levels of strategy/tactics you may have been missing...

Uses the MTG booster draft mechanic, and takes only 15 minutes to play. 
                                          Its so good, that there is no reason to ever play any other filler game EVER again.

Imo, the best way to play is the 4 player partnership (with the advanced cards of course).  All the constant, agonizing decisions over which card to take...often, its the one that helps you, or the one that is really good for one of your opponents. ;)

RATING: 7
An unusual game with some interesting decisions. Still haven't tried the advanced game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.8
A interesting card game which players score points by playing a combination of cards.  The game is played in 4 rounds before the points is calculated.  Players are distributed with 5 cards each.  Players picked 1 and pass the rest to the left/right depending on which round of game it is.  Then players picked another card with the remaining hand and pass the hand to the same direction again.  Players will start playing the round till all the cards are picked by various players.

There are 4 types of cards in the game namely, dragons, fairies, knights and phantoms.  Players are only allowed to place 3 of the 5 cards one after another.  When cards are placed, certain conditions have to be met, eg. to filp/unflip a certain type of card placed previously.

Good points: Though it is a pure card game, the game tries even out the luck element by allowing players to choose the cards they wanted to play.  There are a few ways to combine cards to score points which makes the game versatile.

Bad points: The game can be irritating if there are many good cards that complement each other appears together in 1 go and players are only allowed to play 3 of them in each round.

Excellent fun game. 

In two player we play variant where for each round deal 7 cards to each player. First draft: take one card, discard one card from game then pass remaining 5 cards to opponent.

Play 7 rounds total. This leaves only 2 cards remaining unplayed.

This one get a 5 simply because of the art. It is fantastic. But the game ... SIGH. 
Despite what it says on the box it does not support two players in our opinion. Drafting games by definition really need at least 3 people. Otherwise they are what Fairy Tale is if you try with just 2 players, BORING. 
And it doesn't even have any kind of 2-player variant like 7 Wonders or Among the Stars. Nope. You just play it the same with 2 as with 5. Which, did we mention makes it BORING.

{2 plays, 5 player & 4 player partnership}  My rating will probably drop after more play, but I like the drafting - what really makes it work is that you get get to toss two, so you don't always have to find the best card for you, except for those hands in which it really hurts that you can only play three!  The various ways to score are interesting for now... but... and this is the thing that more play may unfortunately bear out... I never really felt like I was actively doing something clever or strategic.  It was just a bunch of optimizing decisions, albeit interesting ones (for now), but then you didn't really *do* that much with them afterwards, other than score.  FWIW, I prefered the 5-player game over the 4-player partnership, mostly, I suspect, because I don't really know the deck yet, which would be more important in the partnership game.

This and Tichu are both fantastic four player partnership card games.  I like that light cooperative-competitive genre a lot, and I find it is worth owning both of them for variety.

Fairy Tale is a drafting game, which is also a favorite.  I like balancing what I want to take for myself against what I don't want to leave for my opponents against what I might be able to leave for my partner.

You score by collecting different kinds of sets, and these are well designed to all build-up and score a little differently -- rewarding both long term and short term planning.

I'd recommend only playing the game as 4 player partnership.  Play with the optional rule to pass cards when you play a black card.  And we also like passing the draft left-across-right to allow for more partnership interaction.

RATING: 8
I really liked this.

The mechanic is fun- it actually made me miss playing Magic the Gathering back when I used to do booster drafts with my friends.  You never know 100% what you're strategy is going to be until you have 2-3 cards in your hand.

Then, when you place them, it's like a whole new strategy.  Your opponents could destroy your carefully laid plans, or you could inadvertently help them. 

It's really just a fun, well designed game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Feels like a foreign design to me despite the common draft elements - which is a positive.  I don't find it to be the easiest game to teach, but I might have better luck with the basic game.  Find it to be more in the gamer-filler space, although I'd much rather spend my time drafting a single pack of MTG cards or a hand of Agricola - without even playing a game of it - because I find those drafts so much more interesting and discussion-worthy.  I used to own the original, but I prefer the Z-Man edition for the cardstock, layout, and rules.

RATING: 7
Good game.  Four players makes for a much better game experience than two.  It moves very quickly, and once you get past the poorly laid out rules, it's pretty simple.  I find the symbolism to be confusing to new players, but it starts to click after a while.

A great little drafting game.  Like so many card games this one is easy to bring out and get people going on quickly.

I don't know if this theme means anything or not.  To me it's pretty flimsy, but if you are inspired by anime art this might wiggle your piggle a little.

The game is fun though.  It's a great illustration of what makes drafting games compelling.  

Plays fast.

This game is fun, but it might have been supsrceded by 7 Wonders

Nem tudom, nekem ezek a "paszírozzunk rá jó sok ikont, legyen jó sok féle kombó, és ezekből lehessen gyűjtögetni pontokat" kártyák olyanok, hogy akkor már inkább játszok egy táblás játékkal. 
Nem mondom, hogy rossz, de nem annyira szórakoztató, ha ikonokat kell bogarásznom. Biztos, ha már készség szinten megy, akkor jobb. Egynek azért elment így is.

I personally, really enjoy this game and with my gaming group, 4 out of the 5 of us there that night really liked it.
The one of us who didn't was one who isn't good with maths and has a terrible memory. He doesn't like reading cards and despite there only being 3 or 4 words on a card, he just couldnt get into it enough to look at what images match with what.
I have dyscalcia so I'm not a fan of maths myself but still found this really enjoyable. 

I'd say if you have a bad memory but are good at maths, you will be ok. If you have a good memory but are bad at maths, you'll be ok.

If you're both of these things, this game may not be for you.

This game took the draft mechanic from Magic the Gathering well before (2004) it was presented to the vast majority of the boardgamers by 7 Wonders...
Fairy Tale is a fast and light filler (much faster than 7 Wonders: it can be played in 15 minutes!), that perhaps lacks the variety and replayability of its more notorius descendant, but gives lots of choices and fun in a very small amount of time.

I have no idea what people see in this. I am not sure I would consider decisions more meaningful than in War with a few more plays... this is really stupid waste of time, and unlike games like 6 nimmt this one doesn't bring out any emotions.

Played several times and not sure what I think about it.  It is a drafting game, but it is convoluted enough that it isn't a gateway game.

Definitely recommend introducing others to Sushi Go first to get them used to the mechanic before introducing this game to them.

Initial Impression: I'm not sure what to think about this game. The artwork in this edition is really beautiful and the game seems simple enough. However, I'll need to play it some more to get a feeling of what to do and how to achieve the goals. I believe that when I begin to more easily identify the synergies between the cards, I'll have more fun with it. The game itself plays fairly quickly and looks as if it'll stand up to repeat plays.

After a couple of initial plays, I really enjoy this game.  This rating will almost definitely go up.  Played with 2 and 3 players, and it works well with both of those numbers.  I want to see how it fares with up to 5.  If it scales as well as I think it will, this has potential to turn into one of my favorite card games.

UPDATE: Played with 5 players, which is the max, and it scales wonderfully.  Drafting is a little tougher (and more interesting) because you'll never see your initial draw after you've passed it, so you won't know what's coming up.

The fact that this game sets up immediately, scales perfectly well from 2 - 5 players, teaches easily, and is a whole lot of fun may be enough to squeak it past "Hey, That's My Fish!" as my favorite filler.

Hard to beat Penguins as a theme, though...


UPDATE: Vastly faster set-up time than Hey That's My Fish may be what puts this over the top.  Just played with 4 people for the first time, and it still plays wonderfully.  Quick gameplay and oodles of fun.  This game will get MUCH table time for a long time to come, I have no doubt.

Very nice filler game. The artwork on the cards is very much to my liking. The gameplay seems utterly random at first. But it's not long before you see you have a lot more influence than might initially think. There is a lot you have to keep track of so some people could go into AP mode. Do not alow this as this game should be played quickly.

Would have liked to play this game more. But I was unable to interest others in it. Traded it away and was a bit sad to see it go.

[-]This seems kind of boring with two. Seems like it would play better with more since the draft is the more interesting part. With two you are just passing the cards back and forth. My jury is still out on this one. My score could go up or down when I find out how it plays with more than two players.[/-]

I now really enjoy this game despite my lukewarm reception of it a year ago (admittedly, just as a two player game). It's really cool draft cards. I like to concentrate less on which card is going to be good for me and more on which of the remaining cards will be offering my opponent a tough decision. Coming to a conclusion on both is ideal.

What a brilliant game system!  It feels like it is complex when you explain the rules, but after one game you quickly discover the strategies.  I love how the card-drafting adds some really tough decisions as you choose whether to further your points or halt another player's scoring.  I find it highly addictive and always want to play one more time after I'm done.

What makes it so amazing is the simple fact that you want nearly every card that comes through your hand, but you're only allowed to draft one.  There is also some slight strategy in knowing when to flip your opponents' cards which can hurt their scores a lot.  I enjoy the game with any number of players.  It is quite different with 2, but it still works well.  If you're not familiar with card-drafting you should definitely check out this awesome game.

Drafting cards is a crowded field and this one does it well. Fairy Tale has all the tension of making sets and hoping you'll get that one last card. Gives you a few opportunities to mess with other players.

But the art and the icons has been a huge turn off for the people I've played it with. It barely got played before I got rid of it.

It's been quite awhile since I've played Magic: The Gathering, but my favorite type of match was a Booster Draft; wherein each player chooses a card from a pack, keeps it, passes the pack to the left, takes a card from the new pack, repeat.

Fairy Tale recreates my favorite aspect of magic, but in a non-CCG.  Clearly, they know how to make me happy.  There is a minor balance issue, in that the stories offer too big a payout in a two-player game, which is where the majority of my plays come from.  Still, drafting your cards and choosing the play is great fun, and the rules are so concise it is easy to teach.  Recommended.

Looking past that, the draft mechanic is awesome and there are plenty of strategies to try.  Just make sure the people you game with can stomach the anime theme.

This is one of the original strictly drafting card game. It has a bit of a learning curve and has likely been replaced by 7 wonders for those wanting a little more strategy, and by tides of time/madness for those wanting a simple quick study for two.

Need a few more games of this under my belt. Takes a little while to get your head round all the symbols, after that this is quite a straightforward game with a nice mixture of card drafting for yourself and blocking other players.

Update: Lots of plays now. I love this game, a fantastic implementation of card drafting (much better than 7 Wonders).

I wouldn’t expect anything else than tedium from a manga-illustrated Japanese fantasy card game yet surprisingly I’ve been somehow entertained by Fairy Tale: actually, were it some more interactive, it could even play a decent filler.

This is one of the games I got when I first started playing games again.  With the new edition out, I still find myself getting this played very frequently, and I never really get tired of it.

This is something I will never get rid of, and will be in my collection forever.

Valuable lesson here, kids:  played this twice in same sitting. Only one of us knew the game. 1st game, we scratched our heads and said, "uhhhhhm, okay."  But the teacher insisted that (now that we get how it should work) we should try again (it's a quick game). That game was alot of "Ahhhhhhh, now I see!" and we all really liked it. Will definitely play again! You can see where games like Dominion and 7 Wonders got some inspiration here!

If this were only slightly shorter I could lump it into the filler category.  As it is, this is still a great game in the 20-30 minute category.  You are constantly bombarded by engaging decisions that have a very tangible effect on gameplay.  The luck of the draw is thoroughly mitigated by the drafting mechanic.  Bottom line: A very unique game outside of normal German gaming, but still adheres to the same principle.  My only complaints are with the symbols that take players a few games to understand.  Finally, the four-player partnership game is a stroke of genius, especially with the Garfield variant.

Almost straight up card drafting... with some card flips and hunts to mix it up a bit.  Good for 2-4, but not for 5.  Moderate learning curve so experience helps a lot.  Pretty fun, but the 12 card matrix was too small for my liking.  Feels like the game is over before you get started.  There are so many different cards... In order to get lots of points, you really need to narrow your focus (and hope for a good shuffle since you'll not see more than half the deck).  Also you need to pay very close attention to what your opponents have built (which isn't easy since tons of information is crammed on the cards).  Plus you need to know what is in the deck that could bring big points for you and your neighbors card combos.  ** UPDATE 2008: I don't like the 5-player game since none of your starting cards make it back to you.  ** UPDATE 2010: I'm not as fond of this game as I used to be.

RATING: 6
While I enjoy the basic mechanisms in the game (drafting, card play) the graphic design of the cards detracts significantly from the overall experience. Having to lean and turn your head to read individual cards in someone else's tableau and trying to decipher whether the card you were thinking of passing them would benefit them or not is particularly frustrating.

Fairies! Deamons! and Knights, Oh My!

This is a handsome little game that plays in 20 minutes.  

There is some nice artwork on the cards that screams anime'.  For anyone into that genre of storytelling, this game would be a dead ringer.

There are some tricky little icons on the cards that give each a class that it belongs to.  They then are part of groups,suits and can be played to gain victory points.  

There are some neat dynamics to this game as card hards are not totally secret and are passed clockwise then counterclockwise, reversing through the different acts/stages.  There is nothing glaringly obvious about opponents strategies and there is much that is left up to other players as to how they can affect what can end up on your table area. 

The tactics in your mind that are developing, are secret-yet on display, so the wins can be very close and exciting.

An interesting drafting game which is a step up from sushi go where you play only 3 cards out of a hand of 5 and those cards have different interactions and effects that can gain or lose you points.  The art is very nice along with the quality of the cards, also the ability to step up the complexity with expert level cards makes this a very solid game in my book.

The best thing I can say about this game is it is quick to teach (5 - 10 minutes), quick to play (10 - 15 minutes), scales to 5 and is portable.  While I've only played this with the basic rules, I don't think adding the advanced rules will increase the depth which is relatively low.  

It's not a bad game but with the number of games in this market, I don't think it will have much playtime.

There must be some hidden magic in "Fairy Tale", because it brings so much fun to the table, despite it apparent simplicity and dated looks.

It really hard to pinpoint why it works so well - it seems to be having exactly right amount of interaction, strategy and luck-tempting, all stuffed into blazingly fast and elegant package.

Amazing, how game of such age is still holding strong in a card-drafting genre.

This game is really weird for me.  I only play it once every couple of years and don't usually enjoy myself, but I recognize that it's an interesting game, and I suspect that my rating would shoot up if I got to play it on a more regular basis.  EDIT: Rating upped to 7.5 after another play soon after the second play.  Game went quickly and it felt like it was possible to plan (unlike the first two times I played).

The first play can be a little rough as the flip only going down can be confusing and translating some of the symbols can be tricky.  I like the intricacy and choices.  Not a meaty game but a good set collection game to pull out every once in a while.

I've finally bumped up it's rating - how can you fault a game that is still interesting after many hundreds of plays - especially considering it's cost and size - easily the best value for money in my gaming cupboard!

Bumped up the rating again.  My only 10 so far.  The geek describes a 10 as: 'Outstanding.  Always want to play this and expect that will never change.'

I have never turned down a game of this - I still enjoy it and find it interesting many hundreds of plays on.

Great little filler that really gets played one round after another.
It is short enough but also challenging enough to be played multiple times without getting dull.
Artwork is ohkay...if you like Anime. Otherwise, like me, you just play the game and don't look on the pictures.
The card quality isn't that sturdy. This is a game that really needs to be sleeved immediately.
But I really love the gameplay, it pulls everything possible out of it's limited possibilities.
Not much of a game but good at what it is.

RATING: 6
A card drafting/set-making game. The drafting mechanism reminds me of my days playing in MtG Booster Draft. Players select one card from an initial hand and then pass their hand to the left. This is repeated until all cards are selected. Players aim to build their own hand and deny other players cards they might need. Then players play 3 of their drafted cards to score points and affect cards in play. For me this drafting mechnism is the heart of the game and is more important (and fun) than the card playing itself. Although the cards are glossy and attractive there are some poor design choices (important numbers in tiny font) and the fairy-tale theme never really comes together for me.

An entertaining, light, filler. There aren't many hard decisions to make, and a lot of it is randomly decided by the luck of the draw, but drafting is always fun, especially after the first round when you can see what other players are going for.

Uses the draft mechanic, and that would be fun if the cards had an interesting theme, or if the pictures for the cards you pair up didn't look so similar.  Sadly, this is one game that could really benefit from a license (Magna or otherwise).  Still, it's something new, and not entirely awful.

This is a pretty decent game with a very cool card drafting mechanism: get a hand of cards, keep one, pass the rest to the left.  Repeat until you have a full hand of cards.  The game reminds me of a TCG in how the cards all interact with each other.  Because of the drafting mechanism, it's not too difficult to get the cards you need.

Tried one basic game, two player. Very fast, but also dry and somewhat dull. The lack of any serious player interaction in the basic deck is unfortunate. Maybe the full game will be better. UPDATE: 4->6. I like it a bit more. I mean, it's all drafting, all the time, and you are at the mercy of the card draw, but it is very quick (10-15 minutes), and there is some planning and some push-your-luck element that makes it enjoyable enough. UPDATE: 6 -> 7. This game is getting even better. It plays so quickly, but there are elements of push-your-luck and set-building that we seem to enjoy.

I enjoyed it the twice I've played but this is a game I think probably needs played more often to get the best out of it.  I'm not sure that'll happen though as it was about as hard to pick up and play the second time as it was the first, which is not encouraging.  Interesting though to play it after Notre Dame and be given a very vivid reminder of where ND's drafting mechanism most probably came from.

I am still looking for that drafting game where you'll play the cards you draft.

Yes, there is some play, but this is really more of a set collection game where you disrupt others either by hate drafting or flipping their cards, and defend yourself by drafting unflip cards you hope to never use.

It's pretty harmless and quick.

This is a terrific and fun game.  I have never played any CCG's so I can't compare it to them however, the card drafting / sharing mechanism is super tense.  In a 2-player game, you effectively know nearly all the cards in play each round, the entire game play is built around your anticipation of your opponents character and what you can deduce about their likely tactics. This game allows for the greatest type of gaming possible, a battle of wits and character against your opponents.  Since the game only sets a framework, replayability is limited only by the number of different opponents and opponent types you can find to play with.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I feel like I want to get to know this better. As it is, I can't help but see it as an incredibly simple game, since I only really register the actual playing of the cards, rather than the drafting. More plays may help me to find hidden depths in the subtleties of drafting. A group very familiar booster drafts or similar would probably be a lot of help.

After going through and understanding the cards, I still felt that there wasn't much to the game.  You do what you can when you get a chance to do it, and that's it.  You can't plan, there's little deduction, and the play is repetitive.  I like the partnership game as filler, and I purchased it based on the new What's Your Game art.

As I wrote in my mini review of Among the Stars, I have found that I like drafting games, so this one should be right up my alley. While there were some neat ideas and the gameplay was decent, it wasn’t that funny. 

One thing which needs to be mentioned when comparing Fairy Tale to 7 Wonders or Among the Stars, is that you don't pick a card, pass the others on and then reveal your cards. So you draft all of your cards before you choose which ones to play, so you have several options, and every time you pass cards on to other players you cannot be sure what their strategy will be, and you might forgot just exactly which cards you passed on to the player in an earlier round (if you pass a lot of the cards on which multiply in value depending on their number, you're going to lose)!


However, I must confess that I find some of the cards much better than the rest; those which give you 7-8 points seem like a no-brainer as they aren’t that difficult to fulfill. I did like how you need to react to the cards in the other players’ tableaus which make you “hate-draft” sometimes, and I also liked the “haunt” cards. I didn’t care much for the flipping mechanism.

Something I almost never mention is the box size (notice that I own the microbadge “I hate big boxes for little games!”). Fairy Tale takes up extremely little space (it comes in a Coloretto-sized box) which is awesome for my storage situation, so I’m going to hang onto it for now. However, if it came in a 7 Wonders-sized box I would sell it, so that probably tells you how I feel. It’s an okay game and I would play it from time to time, but it’s no 7 Wonders! If you're in the mood for a drafting game and are only 2-3 players, 7 Wonders is probably worse than Fairy Tale, but I would rather play Among the Stars than Fairy Tale if there were only 2-3 players. Or probably just play something else.

Totally abstract. The fairy tale theme is totally irrelevant and doesn't make any sense. Confusing iconography and tiny pictures that I can't distinguish between. Boring and ultimately rather random when many of the other players' cards will make yours flip over anyway.

I like what this game offer after more plays and familiarity with the cards. It's kind of confusing at first because of the iconography and art. It comes in a small box and fills the time nicely with an engaging card drafting mechanic. I really like the set collection aspect and counter drafting opponents. Plays in a little less than 30 minutes, good filler!

Crazy card game where the thousands of ways to score can make your mind revolve needlessly.  Its not that bad really, but it feels like it.  The main mechanic in this game is the 'counter draft' to get more points.  The blind bidding part kind of feels unnecessary so all your decisions are 'what cards do I keep and what cards do I pass'.  The symbols on the cards are confusing.  This one is way to much for what it is.

Fairy Tale is one of the better fillers that I own. It's also an excellent game to play within an hour with my "lunchtime crew." 

The core of Fairy Tale is the drafting mechanic. Players draft and hand of five cards and then simultaneously play three of those cards from their hands. Because players play only a portion of their hand, everyone has the opportunity to "hate draft" from others or develop a contingency plan.

I bought the game, played it a bit, traded it away when 7 Wonders came out, and then ended up picking up the game once again. Ultimately, I like Fairy Tale better. It's leaner with more of a game packed into a shorter amount of time.

RATING: 8
A very enjoyable filler. The drafting and set collection mechanics are very nice. It plays in about 15-20 minutes no matter how many people there are. The cards are nicely balanced and I like the artwork a lot. After a few plays I am starting to find the decisions a little too easy though.

I like card drafting as a system of reducing randomity in games.  I don't particularly like card drafting as method of determining player actions and impacts.  It doesn't help that I don't like MtG and like systems.  If I did like that more, I'd like this game more.  I can see why others would like it, but, well, I'm quite happy to not be them.

Partnership variant is a million times better than the standard rules.  "Basic" rules are an obvious waste of time.

This game has a delightfully short learning curve--since three out of the four suits are the same, it really only takes a couple of games to more-or-less know what's in the deck.  Helpful iconography on the cards--however poorly designed--fills out what you need to know about the deck's composition.

Definitely a shame about the art.

Advanced Rules Only (anyone who has played a few Euros will have NO problem jumping straight into the Advanced Game)

Fairy Tale plays in 10 minutes or so, and is fairly straight-forward, yet has a wonderfully addictive style of play that rewards card counting and opportunism. Best played a few times at the least to get some familiarity with the cards and some basic drafting strategies, but fun straight off the blocks. I think like all filler this one will eventually suffer samey-ness, in this case because of the relatively limited card set (the 3 main suits are each functionally identical) but I am really enjoying this game so far. It does a nice job of fitting that "quick, yet a bit to think about" category. Also, it's easy to carry along.

Notes on the Z-Man Edition: The new edition of Fairy Tale is essentially the same as the original but for two things:

1) The card stock in the new version is much better, thicker, and should hold up better to repeat play.

2) IMO, the graphic design is slightly less appealing in the new version...the backgrounds have been mildly changed and the Japanese text has been removed. Very minor really.

Suprisingly good (particularly considering my distate for "filler" and light card games) but has to be played with a group willing to actually learn how to play it effectively.  There's a good bit of game here, with some interesting decisions and a refreshing, non-Euro derived mechanic in the drafting.  I was impressed that some of the tactics possible in booster drafting a CCG were here, like the beloved "hate draft".  I could do with out the anime art even though it's executed well.

It's best when all of the players have played before and have a grasp of the various card combinations.  Also, having fewer players seems to offer more control, but not all of the cards in the deck will be used.  Three players may be the ideal number.  It's really important to keep an eye on what your opponents are doing, especially with regards to the "*" multipliers!  Nice, quick game.  I'm looking forward to playing the team rules for four players.

Components: Z-Man edition. Beautiful fantasy art. The card symbology is well-designed, in that the symbols are simple and different from each other, but they do clutter up the cards a bit because of their size and square shape, detracting from the imagery. The faction icon is mostly unnecessary, since it duplicates the information conveyed by the card's border color; the category icon could be more thematic. The card name is difficult to read, and nearly impossible to read when listed as the support card for another card. In looking at the newer edition by What's Your Game, I see that the iconography has been improved greatly, both functionality and thematically.

Experience: An interesting drafting mechanism mixed with a few interesting decisions makes for a relaxing, somewhat enjoyable card game. Despite the presence of some attack cards, the game doesn't feel terribly confrontational; the tension comes from competing over limited resources and trying to have the most of this or that. The Draw 5/Play 3 mechanism ensures that players have some wiggle room to react to what their opponents do. But I only rarely find myself caring what my opponents have just done.

I'm not discovering much new with the game from repeated plays. With few players, there are too few cards in circulation to make it probable that a player will draft the cards necessary to score some of the more lucrative bonus cards. More fun with three than with two.

You like drafting? This is that pure, uncut shit, straight from the source. Go ahead, roll up that dollar bill, take a hit. Other drafting games will never seem as good after you have Fairy Tale in your system. You'll realize you've never really hate-drafted before--not like this. You'll realize all those extra mechanics that other games drape over their core drafting element are just dead weight. You'll feel light as a bird.

Played the base game. Mechanic fairly simple to deal with. I think better with less than 5 players, since there is no chance you will see the same cards as you are passing away which I think makes it more random.

Rated in relation to other Filler games. The cards can be difficult to read for people with poor eyesight, and the game only supports up to 5 players which is frequently a problem in my groups, but Fairy Tale is excellent for what it is. Quick, easy, but engaging enough to remain something that I will gladly play every gaming session.

Simple and clever, a solid end-of-evening filler. The symbology seems really confusing at first, but doesn't take long to get the hang of. To an extent, it kind of plays itself, but it's over in 10 minutes so that's not a huge issue. What is an issue is the tiny text on the cards -- it's important to know exactly what cards your opponents have played, which is almost impossible unless you are sitting very close together.

Its relatively quick and simple... almost a filler. There's a bit of strategy and analysis in choosing your cards to boost your score and rob points from your opponents, but only sometimes. Most of the time the choices are obvious and the game becomes a bit mechanical. Didn't really grab me.

Neat idea.  Getting to know the cards helps a great deal, so beginners are at a disadvantage.

This is based upon my initial impression.  I would have to play it a few more times before it could make it higher or lower.  What a weird game!  I would like it more if the icons were more intuitive.

I have played Fairy Tale quite a few times now.  It was a novel concept to begin with, but it is not my favorite.  It is too complicated to play with my family, and not interesting enough to play when I get to hang out with gamers.

Subtle, sublime card drafting game with evocative art; lots of random fun and sometimes-tough decisions in 15 or so minutes.  We can't ever just play it once; one game always follows another.  Great for the price - but card protectors will be needed as the wear shows early on.  
Highly recommended if you like something a bit different...

I had drafted a bit both when I played Magic: The Gathering and when I played the Dungeons and Dragons Miniatures game. So when I found out there was a neat little game all about drafting I decided it was worth spending the small amount that was required to buy it from my FLGS. 

Unfortunately, it underwhelmed. With a set grouping of cards available each game ended up being a little bit too samey, and much of what I loved about drafting in the collectible games was ultimately absent, making the game a little bit boring and lacking in tension.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An interesting card drafting game, where the play of certain cards can force other cards flipped face down, and thus they will not score unless they can get flipped up again.  Probably brilliant for 2004, but I can't think why I would play this in front of 7 Wonders (if I want a longer game) or Sushi Go (a shorter game) these days.

RATING: 8
Sort of a cross between a CCG and rummy.   You are collecting sets and combos by playing one card from your hand each turn.   The catch is that your hand is built by drafting cards around the table.   It's a little hard to value the cards for beginners.   The graphic design is weird, too.   The icons which identify suits and sets are huge and easy to see across the table, but the images and text that show the required combos at the bottom are very small and hard to read.   I love the way that there are 3 symmetric suits, and a 4th smaller "power" suit.  It's a very quick game, and the more I play it, the more I enjoy it.   Hard to find a better game that plays in 10 minutes.

Definitely needs to hit the table more so I can get a better feel for the mechanics. Love a good bit of drafting, but whenever I sit down to explain the rules, I always feel like I've got a bit much to go through for a pure drafting game (Sushi Go tends to be the go-to option for drafting because of this.)

That said, I love the theme so much more than Sushi Go and would love to get into the variant play if we started playing enough to get a good understanding of it.

Drafting aspect is very cool without needing to spending lots of money like a collectible game like Magic. I loved the drafting aspect of Magic. Fairy Tale is no different.

In Fairy Tale, you draft cards. You draft 5 cards per round and play 3 of them. You play 4 rounds. The most points wins. Each card has it's color and abilities. Like Magic, some colors compliment each other.

This is not Citadels light. The only thing it has in common is card drafting. However, guessing what other people have already taken doesn't come into play much at all.

More drafting.  I like how you obtain a group of cards and then only play some of them, and it's kind of interesting that your cards can "attack" other people's cards, but some of the effects are too random and you usually feel bad when you screw somebody over without meaning to.  Also, the game is designed so you never go through the whole deck, but some cards rely on single other cards to be useful, so why take the chance?

It moves at a brisk pace and has several smaller decision to make each round. I'm surprised that there have been no expansions to this game as it would seem that the system would allow it. 

When playing with two, we use a variant where you start with double the amount of cards in your hand and then both draft and discard each round. You see more of the deck this way and the advanced cards come into play a bit more.

I originally had Fairy Tale back in 2008 and didn't overly like it.  Yeah, I still liked drafting games back then but the graphic design was atrocious.  Fast-forward to 2014, a new edition was released which has *much* better graphic design.  In addition, it added some new cards.  I don't think these new cards were the deciding factor of my increased enjoyment of Fairy Tale, but they certainly helped.  I think it was playing some other drafting games (mainly referring to 7 wonders here) has made me appreciate what Fairy Tale has to offer.  Basically if you want a cheap game that accommodates 4-5 people with quick/easy game play with some interesting decisions, this is a good choice.  Decent game.

Played the first time and thought, that's it?  I agree w/ Tom V in his video review, though.  Play once and you'll play again right away....  The 2nd it helped being more familiar with the cards.  After that most players will want to step it up by including the extra cards. Very quick, fine game good for a dose of drafting and a mental break from heavier games.  The 2014 reprint is recommended because it includes 10 extra cards and anyway the box is better.  [Sleeves: used Mayday 57.5mm x 89mm Std USA size.  Only the std thickness at this size fit -- the 100 pack -- the 125% size did not fit without bowing the cards.  Using the 100% size also meant that the cards fit back into the box insert.]

I don't care what you say, I'm convinced this is one of the 10 best games ever sold in a lavender and chartreuse box.

Actually, I was surprised at how flat this fell with three.  It's not the type of game I would ever buy (I won it at the Geekway - yes you should go) - I don't like short games, don't particularly like card games, and fantasy themes are a turn-off.  But after running through the game myself, I became convinced that this was a little dynamo - a fun, strategic game with simple rules that would be a nice emergency filler.

After playing it with three, I'm not convinced that it's fun or terribly strategic.  I think there need to be more shadow cards - why only two of each flipper - why not have the same number of cards as the other suits?  The game needs more flipping and unflipping to increase the interaction.  Our game ended with the players just quietly collecting their sets they wanted.  Withholding cards that another player wants is nice, but it doesn't create enough sense of interaction, because the other players don't know what you're doing.  It seems the game would be improved by more direct attack of other players decks.

2 player variants from bgg:

Variant 1:
two player variant along the lines of the now officially endorsed one for Among the Stars wouldn't work here?

That is:
- deal each player five cards, each chooses and passes on four
- each draws one card from the deck, keeps one and discards one and passes on three
- each draws one card from the deck, keeps one and discards one and passes on two etc.
Variant 2:

In a standard three to five player game, you'll see 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15 cards.

Two player game's draft consists of two parts:

a) Both players take 5 cards. Each player selects a card to keep and a card to discard (=it's taken by "unknown opponent"). Pass draft piles (3 cards) to opponent. Each player selects a card to keep and a card to discard. Pass draft piles (1 card) to opponent.

b) Repeat the same draft with 4 cards more.

In this two player game variant, you'll see 5 + 3 + 1 + 4 + 2 = the same 15 cards!



Variant 3:

After several games, we settled on dealing seven cards out to each player. Choose one and discard one, then pass your hand to your opponent. Repeat once. After you have chosen two cards (when you have three remaining), play reverts to normal. That is, pass your remaining three cards to your opponent, draft another cards, pass the remaining two cards back...

In a standard three to five player game, you'll see 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15 cards. If ten cards are dealt as suggested, you'll see 10 + 8 + 6 + 4 + 2 = 30 cards. That's a huge difference!

In this modified version I've suggested, you'll see 7 + 5 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 18 cards. We feel this is more in line with the feel of the original game.

Japanese designed game (English edition by Zman games, 2004) that utilizes the MtG booster draft idea.  The actual playing phase is quite short, and most of the game is about drafting.  Works terrific with anything from 2 to 5.  I mostly play without the advanced cards with new players, although I have tried the advanced cards a couple of times and enjoyed the additional depth.  For a simpler variant to make the game suitable for children, take out the black cards ([thread=165115][/thread]).  

Resolve in this order: Hunt, Unflip, Flip

Fairy Tale is a neat introduction to set collection and drafting.  Coming from someone is often a conflict oriented gamer I find Fairy Tale to be quite relaxing and once people pick up the swing of it, it plays very smoothly.

This is another solid game a notch above filler-weight that is a great way to introduce newcomers to the more involved side of gaming without overwhelming them but there is enough variety to stop a gamer from getting bored.  The game also has cards for a basic variant anyone should be able to play and an expert variant for more seasoned gamers or new players after they have got a few games of Fairy Tale under their belt.

This game is great!  It goes by very quickly when all the players know how to play.  It can be played with 2 to 5 people.  If you play with people unfamiliar to the game, be gentle with them as the point spread can be huge if they don't understand all the rules for getting points and multipliers.  I rarely turn down this game.  My husband and I like to take it with us when we travel because it is portable.

[b]2015: Best filler drafting game for 4-5p I've played. I'm glad a friend owns it.[/b]

2004. Played 3 times. I liked it so much on the first playing, that I requested a second! I don't know if it is the best filler ever, but after two plays, it's definitely in that area of greatness. Why? Because it packs a heck of a lot of game into 20 minutes -- more than any other game I can think of. Hard to descibe gameplay -- sort of a "booster draft" combined with a light card combined with action cards. And all the ingredients make it special. I don't think I'll ever tire of this game (in moderation.)

[b]2015. 4th play.[/b] This has aged quite well, still being a fun, light drafting game (much more interesting than Sushi Go). However, since this game was released 11 years ago, lots of games have implementing drafting, so this game isn't quite as enjoyable as it once was. Not that interesting with 2p. Needs 4-5p.

Deceptively simple rules, but Fairy Tale seems to take the control of my mind, and I want to play just another game...

The drafting mechanics makes it possible to counter an opponent, but it doesn't feel like you're directly bashing him: a good point for me.

A quick & innovative card game which is the next best thing to playing the "pass the trash" variant of poker or doing an MTG draft.  The anime art detracts from the game because it makes the game look like Yu Gi Oh which then makes getting it on the table a hard sell to other gamers.

RATING: 5
Fairy Tale is an attempt to make an entire game out of the card drafting mechanism that lots of other games use as a preparation step. Does it work?

Tentatively, yes. On the whole it's a little thin, though. Player control is mostly imaginary, and what little decisions there are quickly become fairly mechanical. 7 Wonders does the same thing much better if more ostentatiously and slightly longer.

At least the WYG first edition has a couple of serious design issues with regards to being able to identify card combos, too.

Solid drafting game.  I like it better than something like Sushi Go!  Looking forward to getting some more plays in.  The iOS campaign mode is decent for learning.

iOS: it is much easier to track what is going on (cards played, tableau) than many iOS card games.  Some people don't like the slow pace of the animations but I'm ok with it.  I haven't made it to higher AI difficulty levels so I'm not sure how that will hold up.  At the very least it is useful for learning the game.

Too many cards and difficult to identify the combos. If I was a CCG player, I may had less problem with it. At least, the experience improves a little on each play.

Pretty solid little game that will remind you of playing a CCG draft.  Take a stack of five, choose one, pass 'em on.  Once that's done, play them to try and maximize your score, minimize the damage done to your own cards, and harass your opponents whenever possible with devious Shadow cards.

It's pretty fun I'd say.  Great filler.

EDIT:  My opinion of this game has only increased over time.  Miles upon miles better than 7 Wonders--more interaction, more meaningful draft choices, and when you're at a table with 5 people, you're aware that more than the person to your left and right exists.

AND, hey, it's tons cheaper than 7 Wonders!

I have wanted to try this out, so glad I got the chance. Sadly, the symbology is terrible, terrible, terrible. Figured it out after awhile, but I'm not sure how the graphic design got passed through in the first place. At the end of the day, this is a light card drafter - in the same vein as 7 Wonders, but came before! So kudos to that. But things feel pretty random until later rounds (you really never know if the cards you play will pay off in the end) and trying to hold back cards from your opponents is just frustrating. A light game without enough meat to really carry it through for me. Got kind of bored with this one by the end. Not bad, but not that very good either.

Holy cow this game is terrible.  I e given it 15 plays and can honestly say I have yet to find a strategy that trumps going for *3 multipliers exclusively.  The only way to counter is to sacrifice your on score with shadow cards letting someone else win.  
Other than drafting this has nothing to do with 7 Wonders.  For people that claim this is better I'm wondering if thy have actually played either.  Back in 2004 this may have been fun but it has not aged well and I have little to no desire to ever play again.

This is my go-to card drafting game, simple fun and with all the right elements necessary to make it a game that is neither too simplistic nor too dispersive. If I want to play some filler during boardgame night, Fairy Tale is what I have in mind.

RATING: 6
This is a collecting game with some interesting twists. The scoring is a bit convoluted, and after playing twice, I still wouldn't be able to do it unless I had the rulebook in front of me. Once you get going, you get a better grasp of how to collect cards that will earn you points and pass cards to others that either don't help them or could possibly hurt them. I wouldn't mind trying it again, but I think there are other games that I enjoy more, so if I were given the option, I'd probably end up playing something else.

Okay, so I've played this twice now, and I think I understand the concept to a greater degree, but I still would not say I'm confident that I could jump in and start playing with anybody without it hurting my head a bit. Oddly, I managed to win for the second time when I barely understand what I'm doing. Someone just happened to keep throwing me starred fairy cards, so I kept taking them. It worked out to my advantage.

I think overall, it is more deserving of a spot in your collection than 7 wonders since less overhead for the same amount of pleasure/reward and the same type of strategic thinking. This is a crucially underrated part of lite drafting games. 

edit: I think this is a really high quality game design ( 7 or 8) but it just doesn't have a hook for me and my game group didn't like it so it was never my favorite thing to play.

RATING: 5
I've only played 2-player so far, and I think it's pretty silly that way.  In 2-player:- you know all but one card in your opponent's hand.- the "hunt" effect is practically useless since there is only one other player dropping a card at that moment, and as stated above, he knows you have the card with "hunt" ability.I can see it being much more interesting with 3-5, but there are still issues with the game.  The cards are very attractive, but it's damn near impossible to track what your opponent has in front of him.  It's hard enough to read the cards in front of yourself due to the tiny cursive font, reading it upside-down is fruitless.

This game has rules that make it seem harder than it is. Once you "get" it (draft a card, pass to your neighbor, repeat 5 times and then play 3 of your 5 collected cards) it is quite good. Forget understand scoring without a "learning" round.

RATING: 8
Even though my initial ecstatic impression has weakened a little, I still love Fairy Tale. I enjoy the card drafting and find that it works very well in this game primarily about set collecting. The asymmetry of the Shadow cards adds some interesting interaction and variety. The storybook cards give the players goals to work towards, significantly influencing the decisions they have to make. I like having to weigh the benefits of choosing one card over another in a game where every card has a different value for each player.

I hate that there are so many cards in the deck that I have no chance of seeing. I love the game, the mechanics, the math, the choices, but I can't help but feel that who draws what cards is most likely the deciding factor in a game. Next time I play I might try out some variants depending on the number of players. I would like to have most (if not all) of the cards enter the game. 

Update: My enjoyment of FT left me underwhelmed when I first played 7 Wonders. Is it just that no one owns this game? Why pay $40 for 7 Wonders when you can grab this one for $10? Simpler, quicker, less fiddly. One advantage of 7 Wonders: The deck is adjusted for # of players. This means the deck is shaped to fit the amount of people playing, eliminating some of the 'luck of the draw' element present in FT. The trade-off is that you have to set up the deck each time you play. I'd just play Fairy Tale instead. A fraction of the set-up, explain, play time. Lets you play multiple games and still move on to something else before you'd finish 7 Wonders.

RATING: 7
Initial rating based on 1 play. Coming from a Magic background, the idea of drafting from a fixed pool of cards, together with the ability to discard 40% of what you draft make this game pretty decent. Greater familiarity with the game will only make it better, and then you'll have a better idea of what things combine better & therefore what to draft or pass.

For some reasons it reminds me of 7 Wonders (very) light. 

I like the feel of it, the artwork and the theme. The only thing is that after some plays it may become stale. Maybe this one should be expanded.

In the end this is a very nice little game that comes constantly at our table, recommended!

This (in its WYG edition) has some of the worst iconography I've ever seen in a game-- obscure, actively misleading, dependent on the theme even though the theme doesn't really make sense.

What a difference a proper explanation of this game makes; I played four games, couldn't get enough, and upgraded it from a 5 to a 7.  Most of the game is in the card drafting, which actually works very, very well for two players, to my surprise.  Excellent filler once the players know the rules.

Card drafting, set collection type of game. Needs more plays before I can give any meaningful comments about strategy (or lack of) but it sure seems to play much quicker than the stated time.

Edit: Plays quickly once everyone knows what they are doing but although you can react a little with your card picks and plays you are still at the mercy of the draw a little. Not too bad but there are better card games out there.

So, that's the original "7 Wonders" everyone was talking about. I don't agree that "7 Wonders" is the same game, even though there are similarities.

I think both games offer something good, that the other does not have and this one seems more nasty and offers more interaction.

However, I still don't think that none of them is really great (talking about "7 Wonders" being overrated), but both are good games, even though not my cup of tea, since there's too much luck and chaos involved. I wouldn't run away from either anyway.

Drafting is my favorite MtG playing style, so naturally I like this game as well. The rating is a bit inflated because of my wife liking this one and because it's the easiest game to take to trips that still plays well with any number of players. It's nice and harmless fun.

Note: If you play with only two players, I suggest keeping 2 cards from every starting hand instead of 1. Makes it more interesting, since you see less of the opponents cards.

Drafting is the name of the game. This is the good and the bad of the game. Drafting is somewhat interesting, but the game feels too simple. There are choices of course, but you really cannot play according to certain strategy. Just evaluate the cards and check what opponent has and pick the best card. Needs something more to really deliver.

Gave this one away as a present.

Only played once with 5-players and don't see why I would want to give this another try.  The card draft mechanic is the only thing I found to be Ok, but I played with experienced players and had no idea what I was looking for (which combinations to try and get).  My opponents obviously had no problems blocking whatever it is I was trying to do, while both left and right opponents are the ones who scored the most (obviously I was not blocking them).  Definitely not for me.

RATING: 5
I never really got into this card drafting game -- sometimes I *love* games that boil down to a single mechanic, sometimes I don't. I think in this case, it's because card drafting without a purpose following it (above and beyond scoring) doesn't quite do it for me.

After one bad play (for me). The art is nice in the game but I do not like the graphics. The tiny icons make it difficult for cards to be seen across the table and in our mostly newbie game things were missed (one that turned out to be particularly devestating to me, but it was a mistake). Once you get the hang of it I can see this game possibly rising in it's rating for me, but again, the graphics do not help the game.

I was surprised that I enjoyed this game so much because I do not like Lost Cities and this game does involve math. This game does not have the feel of a traditional card game because you pass the cards to other players and try to guess what actions those players will make.

This was a game that I just knew I would enjoy as I read the descriptions and reviews on BGG.  I was right.  This is a unique card game because it utilizes a draft.  Then the game involves set collection with cards that can be flipped or unflipped (thus not counting towards the final point total or counting towards that total) by yourself or other players as cards are played.  It is really very clever and best of all, FUN. - - - Alright, it's official.  I'm an addict.  This is a great game!!!!!

One of the games I purchased to get my girlfriend into gaiming. She picked it out based on theme and the idea that somehow the players would be telling a story. She was discouraged by the actual game however and hasn't played it yet. On the flip side, my game group actually likes this game because of the whole magic drafting feel to it. Ultimately I felt it didn't have the depth or experience i was looking for, I'm not big on set collecting games so I traded it.

This is quite possibly the best recent game to come out of Japan (I'm leaving aside Go, obviously). A simple card collecting game that you can play in 20 minutes. The tension in the game lies entirely in the drafting phase: do you keep the card you want, or the card you think the next player wants? The simultaneous blind play is weaker as it means that the Hunt/Open/Close mechanism isn't as big a factor as it should be and the game really needs 5 otherwise some of the cards are left undealt. Great for the playing time, but Race for the Galaxy is a better, if heavier game and only takes 10 minutes longer.

RATING: 6
This is a light drafting game, and once you know all the rules (like the one where you get to keep cards from round to round) it makes a lot more sense. I can see the comparison to 7 Wonders, but I think the newer game does a better job, if only for its superior icons and hints as to what you might want to do. (3 plays)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I think the game is quick but ok. The game is not attracting to me so much, maybe because of the card drafting mechanic. This mechanic doesn't work for me so much because I often lose the big view of what is happening when I playing the game and that make my win or lose not so much fun.

RATING: 4
Beautifully illustrated, but suffers from usability problems. The iconography takes some time to get used to. Once you understood their flow, they were comprehensible, but it took some time. Basically, it is a card passing game, but jazzed up with plenty of special cards and themed sets to accumulate. It is a decent simple game, but the weird iconography and price do not balance out the good-looking cards.

First played on Jan 31, 2007.  This is an interesting game.  I was able to play with the expansion cards on the 3rd game.  This card game has more strategy than first meets the eye.  There is enough luck in there too by drawing the cards.  It might take a few plays before understanding the game and is worth consideration of a game play every once in a while.  Update: this can be played in 10-15 minutes after getting the hang of it which makes it an awesome filler game.

Card drafting is fun!  Combine it with some simultaneous selection and you've pretty much gotten rid of downtime.  The theme and art are cute, even though they're just a facade.  Doesn't bother me though, since the math equations written on them are cuter than baby dragons to me.

Set collection type strategy game where you keep passing the same set of cards back and forth taking one at a time while trying to build groupings of cards to score points.

Not sure what all the fuss was about, it's an 'alright filler'

Lacking for me in some areas, a little shallow and limited to drafting and set collection, also advanced rules are needed so don't play without them. In it's defense it is a 15 minute game. Might be better suited as a team game, will need to try it. 

Cards were bad quality and needed sleeves, considering it is a card game cards should have been better quality

RATING: 3.5
the game has enough depth to warrant several plays, and then more still once playing with the expert variant

I however feer that my conclusion will not be positive, in the standard game it's a case of making a choice in the first draft as to what you are going to collect as well as hopefully a backup plan if you are able. The problem is that it's down to luck as to whether what you want comes out of the deck and whether anyone else also decides to collect the same thing thus tanking both your scores.

The expert variant adds more big points cards to the deck but it also dilutes some base game strategies. You can draft the expert cards at the start and hope that you get the cards that synergise with them, or you can go with a standard game strategy and hope to draft the expert cards later.

It's pleasing to play so far but I fear that the game really is just too luck based.

This is an interesting and fun game, but I'm disappointed that the theme doesn't really do much for the game.  The more I've played it, the more I've been able to focus on the thematic elements on the cards, but the game doesn't really use or need them.  The expert game is better than the basic game.  I only played the basic game the first time we pulled it out, because none of us had played the game before. Update: The newest edition adds even more stuff, but I'm not as fond of the game as I once was.

This game is fun! I love how all the cards interact. There's strategy in drafting the right cards: getting cards to help you while keeping cards that help your opponents. There's a lot of strategy in the play of cards, too: timing is important, and flipping cards can be infuriating—in a fun way. And it has an expansion right in the box! Definitely recommend this game. One of my favorites.

Initial Rating : 8.0 (July 2010)

This game was one of my first board games, I like it but if I played it now for the first time I´m sure my rating would have been lower. It is fairly easy to teach it and the art is pretty good. What I really like about the game is the draft mechanic, it makes for very interesting decisions, also the play time is relatively short. Perhaps it is very simple for some gamers but for now it remains a winner for me.

It´s been years since I last played Fairy Tale and my desire to play it continues to diminish as time goes by. I still think it is a good draft game, perhaps the best to introduce new gamers to the mechanism (along with Sushi Go).

The decisions needed to play it aren’t very complex, so I don’t need to play it again. I will if requested, but I’m not in a hurry to do so. I’m downgrading its rating.

We've only had one session. This struggled a bit with us trying to work out even roughly how the cards interact with each other, and of course having no real idea what combination might turn out to be valuable made the play feel a bit arbitrary. I'm not sure I want to invest the time to become instinctive with the deck, which is what it clearly needs for good play. We were too busy trying to learn the game to get any feel of the supposed story telling element.

Interesting concept that was very different from what I imagined. A nice little filler. You pick 1 card from a hand then pass to the left until you get your hand. Then you try to make sets while opponents are trying to sabotage you and make their own.Update: Just bought the Z-Man edition and find it sooo much better trying to play it so I upgraded from a 7 to an 8. The cards are smaller but better quality with the images bigger and named for easier recognition.

Fairy Tale is a light game.  It's basically draft and play.  There is some lighter strategy in how you play, but it can sometimes feel like a crap shoot, at least in the first couple rounds.  However, as you play through, you start to realize the synergy of the cards.  There's still some luck, but getting those partnerships between the different cards is incredibly important.  I like the ease and speed of play and it makes for an interesting time.  Very nice artwork as well.

A card drafting game for people who like to read other people's icons.  The set collection element is not very intuitive. You are forced to memorize and/or decipher other people's cards to figure out what they are collecting.  You have have something like a Green Giant, but you aren't collecting green giants.  Green Giants collect blue bunnies. (I made that up, but that is what it feels like).  Just awful.

3/5. Decent card-drafter with some fun set collection and special cards to mix things up. But doesn't really hit the table for me just based on what else I have in my collection. If I'm looking for a quick, light card drafter for non-gamers or as a filler I would almost alwaays go for the quicker, lighter Sushi Go. And if I had the time and audience for something just a little meatier (in Fairy Tale's range) I would usually play 7 Wonders. This was better for 2-player, but now Among the Stars has kind of taken up that spot as my go-to 2 player drafter. Good game but it just doesn't fit in anywhere anymore.

Fairy Tale has almost been rendered obsolete by 7 Wonders. While Fairy Tale was the real innovator, 7 Wonders took the core idea and improved it by miles. The only advantage left for Fairy Tale is its portability. Its weaknesses like the uncalculable effects of hunt/close cards became all to clear.

This plays less confusing than it seems from reading the rules and trying to explain it. While trying to optimize your own hand at first there is much more to this game once you also focus on keeping cards away from your opponents and playing interactive cards.
One drawback are the unclear card graphics that make it difficult to see what other cards you need and even more difficult to see what that guy on the other side of the table is looking for. I collected the wrong friends.

Z-Man edition

Rating seems more likely to go down slightly than up. It's at heart a very good and clever card game with a fair bit of luck but also some strategy and tactics. Very nice art and decent fairytale theme. Drawbacks, though, include the flip/unflip terminology (the Japanese version's open/close makes more sense), the likelihood of messing up the card drafting (e.g., people ending up with too few/many cards; passing the cards in the wrong direction), and the "math" element (simple algebra, but not always what you want to be doing). Plays OK with 2, but 3 or 4 (or 5 with advanced rules) is better (so you don't keep drafting cards from the same two hands). The advanced cards do add some risk/reward elements in that you can score big but are subject to sometimes tough conditions.

Sort of thinking of getting the new edition with the open/close terminology.

RATING: 9.1
When playing with less than 5 players, I prefer drawing 6 cards and playing 4 each round.  This draw 6/play 4 is especially good with 3 players; you get two cards from each hand and more time to play defense.

Another (but minor) change I like is changing the three 8-point stories that require you to have 2+ of the other two major suits, to requiring 3+ of the others.  As it is, these stories are just too easy.

I'm not a big fan of the theme or the art on the cards - in fact that style of animation almost bothers me.  However, the game seems to have a lot of potential and plays really quickly.  It seems like 2 is not the ideal number of players, but it is still enjoyable that way.  I like the card-drafting mechanic.  I'm sure the game becomes more interesting as you get to know the cards better.

A brilliant game. Looks really good, everything works well and there is a lot of possible strategies for drafting. The possibility of hate drafting is also there, but it isn't so important because mostly you could pick a clearly best card for yourself. The life of the game is also nicely lenghtened through pairplay. The only con is probably that the face of the card is quite inoptimally used.

Drafting and simultaneous selection card game that seems to show different faces depending on the player count. With two, there will be few surprises and counterdrafting is perfectly sensible. With four or five you will never get to choose from the same batch twice, there will be more abilities triggering, "Plague Rats" are viable, it becomes harder to keep track of what everyone is doing, and hate drafting is not a priority. Overall seems like a nice filler, and I would choose this before 7 Wonders and its arcane scoring.

Pretty simple drafting game. Teaching the game takes a bit but people tend to get it pretty quick. The symbols tend to confuse more than help at first :p

Love how you're drafting 5 cards each round and then choose 3 to actually play. Perfect for a hatedrafter like me :3

The thing is... it's an awesome drafting game but the mechanic has become so popular lately that I'm notsure it still holds up as well...
I have to bring it out more, use it like a real filler. That should enable me to evaluate it better. Still, it pains me to rate this game so low :( 6 means it's a good game and I really do enjoy playing it! Just... there probably are better games out there to fill the same spot/scratch the same itch.

Based on 5  plays.  A fun, quick filler.  The card-drafting mechanic makes me all misty-eyed for my old CCG days.

Heavy initial instruction (lots of this does this but not this and then this kind of explanations), but once play begins it's very light and people will catch on quickly.  Kind of dry with 2 players, but is a lot of fun with 4.  Excellent light filler.  It's possible to whip through several (3-4) games within an hour.  It so far (after 15 games) has gotten better as we get to know the cards better.

Too many combinations on the cards to learn and understand especially since I have no interest in the fantasy theme.  And I don't see the "forming a story" aspect that this game is billed as having.  It's simply card matching and grouping in different combinations. Up to now I've only played this because someone in a game group owned it and pulled it out occasionally.  But this is one of those games where my tolerance to do this has reached its limit.  Now there are other games that do the same thing far better such as 7 Wonders and Sushi Go.

RATING: 4
It's an okay game, but not too exciting, when you figure it out.  There isn't a whole lot of interaction and the draft is pretty random, actually.  I'm sort of on the fence about the graphic design and the symbols.  I have the Z-man edition.  It's passable, I guess.

Kell egy kis idő, hogy megszokja az ember a különböző jelöléseket. Számomra egy picit zavaró volt az elején, hogy a pontszám alatt van egy kisebb szám is, ami a lap típusát jelöli. Miután megértettem a logikát, már el tudom fogadni, hogy van értelme, de az elején megtévesztő tud lenni, hogy az mit keres ott, és mit is jelent.
A feltétellel rendelkező lapoknál szerintem furcsán van megoldva a jelölés. Annyira kicsi a kép, hogy nehéz felismerni, melyik lapról is van szó. Persze, ha már játszik az ember pár kört, akkor megszokja.
Amúgy nagyon szórakoztató játék. A lapok begyűjtése ötletes, és annak a során van esély egy kis taktikázásra, de azért túl sok interakció nincs a játékosok között. Mindenki pakolgatja magának a lapokat, és néha döntenie kell, hogy inkább azt a lapot veszi el, ami neki kell, vagy azt, ami az ellenfélnek. A játékélmény emlékeztet az Elveszett városokra, de ha választani kellene, inkább ezzel játszanék.

I really wish this had a better theme (but not another Egyptian-Italian Renaissance-seeking the King's favor theme)- but it doesn't matter. The game play has nothing to do with Elven Warriors, Bards, and- God help us- mischievous fairies. I enjoyed it quite a bit for 4 players (being new to drafting games), but worried about how it would work for 2. Since Secret Santa surprised us with this, my wife and I find, at first, that it works wonderfully as a super-quick filler.

When we played it for 4 players, I found the advanced rules with the hunt added nothing but chaos- but no qualms about the basic version.

RATING: 8
Lately, a lot of games are starting to implement some kind of drafting mechanism, as it's a nice way of keeping things balanced, but not much of them are about card drafting. In this one, 90% of the game is card drafting. Not more, not less. And it's done in a wonderful way.

The components are top notch: not only it has some awesome illustrations, but the symbols that explain you how a card works are recognizable, even at distance, once you get used to them. And it won't take you long.

About the theme, well... It could have been named "Collecting Potatoes" and have photographs of potatoes instead of the fantasy illustrations.

The downside is that, as almost any other card drafting game, this one needs a bit of chaos to be fun, which means that it only shines with five players. With two or three you have many more things under your control, but soon all the plays seem obvious and the whole experience itself seems to follow some kind of invisible rail that makes all games feel the same. With five luck will affect you more, but the whole thing will be much more fun and it won't last longer, so if you are screwed badly you just can wait 10 minutes and play another game.

The main drawback of this one is that quite a large bunch of people just find it pointless, but because they find boring a game that's only about card drafting, so they see it as a stupidly short and lame filler. Not sure if this one is for you, but it's one of those games that deserves a try.

Players use card drafting and simultaneous action selection to score points while interfering with other players' ability to do so. The game consists of four rounds. In each of them, players are dealt five cards. They simultaneously select one each and pass the remainder, repeating until done. Then, they start playing cards simultaneously, playing three and discarding two. When the cards are revealed after each selection, card abilities turn other cards face-up or face-down. At the end of the four rounds there are 12 cards in front of each player. The players each score based on their face-up cards.

Not many good card drafting games around, this is one.  Given the mechanics, this would have worked better with a less geeky theme and a somewhat simpler scoring scheme but overall it's a fine game.

Charming little card game which involves a good bit of card drafting, seeking to collect sets or combinations which will score you points at the end of the game.  Each game consists of 4 drafts and you end up playing 12 cards in front of you.  Some cards also cause you to flip or unflip cards; any flipped cards at the end are discarded and not scored.  Plays quickly and is easily learned and taught.  Experienced players will do better as they will have a knowledge of the cards and the different combinations.

This game is something like "Speed Magic". You draft cards and then play them out. The cards interact with each other in interesting ways. The rules aren't the best written and the drafting mechanic may confuse some, but I've found it to be a fun filler.

We finally gave it a try with just the two of us and it felt slightly anti-climactic.  One of our disappointments was that there was really no storytelling theme to the game at all---it was mostly a set collection game with a clever twist.  The draft mechanism felt novel and in theory should be a good way to force interaction with the other player (should I keep a card that benefits me or should I keep a card that benefits her?)  However, the card design is not very friendly.  The script font makes it difficult to quickly see what cards your opponent has so it becomes difficult to draft cards.  This is one area where the clean iconography of a game like [thing=28143][/thing] is leaps and bounds better.  Other than the user interface, we were indifferent to the anime-style artwork.

However, with just two players, you just don't see enough of the deck.  We tried extending the game by having two more drafts and playing 18 cards, but we still had a large chuck of the draw deck left untouched.  As a result, the set collection felt very random and it was impossible to develop any long term strategy since you couldn't plan on reasonably seeing any specific card.  It's a shame since the actions seem neat.  Still, we're looking forward to trying this with more people and the partnership game sounds intriguing (although we're starting to build up a collection of partnership card games that don't really work for two, such as [thing=215][/thing] and [thing=371][/thing], that we haven't even played yet).

- People find the scoring more complicated than I anticipated
- The busy graphic design works poorly to make the game intuitive.
- Game is very fast, I'd hazard faster than Sushi Go
- People pick it up fast if they've played Sushi Go before, even if there is confusion the first round
- The fact you draft 5, but play 3, means people actually pay attention and don't just go for personally optimal plays.
- The fact you draft and then reveal smooths the experience.
- Feels more strategic because you can pick from your 5 as the reveals take place, updating your strategy, but also drafting emergency unflips, or taking flips to stop them being used on you.
- The fact you basically can't draw "dead" cards like in Sushi Go is a plus. It's no fun to get 1 Tempura, or 2 Sashimi and have those turns wasted. 
- The complexity level keeps me engaged enough as to not fall asleep like Sushi Go, but is fast and uncomplicated compared to 7 Wonders.

RATING: 5
Maybe it was the rule book, the icons or just us, but we found this game confusing. Once  we did figure it out, it just didn't do anything for us. Disappointing because we wanted an alternative to Sushi Go (a theme we're not into).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Always makes me think of Magic: The Gathering due to the drafting rules. Stupid 'open/close' symbols, and 'flip/unflip' doesn't help any. How is it intuitive which of these means 'face up' ?? Cards are bizarrely busy... Once you get this game going it runs nicely and smoothly, but getting it started and explained is a [b]chore[/b].

RATING: 8
One of my favorite quick fillers, Fairy Tale is a very short drafting game where you go through several rounds of simultaneous reveal. I particularly like the way that you draft 5 cards but only actually play 3 each round because it gives you some flexibility with strategy based on later cards you draft that is lacking from many similar card drafting games (particularly things like Sushi Go).

Fairy Tale has some aspects that I don't typically enjoy in games.  To some degree, it rewards a good memory, which I don't have.  It *can* get a bit mathy, which I don't enjoy.

Boring in two players, even if we use the Citadels' drafting system, and not much better in three. Perhaps it is just the first impression, but e.g. Citadels were fun even for the very first time! I hope that one day I'll either see this game's beauty, or trade it away in the most profitable way.

EDIT(2009-09-13): 6.3, due to much better impression from recent games. When playing in two, DO use Winston draft - with the added rule that once you have more than five cards in your hand, you don't draw any more.

2009-09-18: 6.3 -> 7.0 About as much of "fairy" as in Rummy. However, this game has its qualities.

A card drafting game where you acquire cards that form sets.  You also have a attack cards which can cause some cards to flip over and no longer have any value.

Otherwise the art and card quality is fine.

Fairy Tale (What's Your Game? Second Edition)

Great mechanism and really like the set collection and double guessing the other players actions and then attempting to sabotage them.

Although this is quite a simple game, the learning curve is a barrier to casual players in that they don't really know what to collect.

Art cuteness is a significant factor in getting this to the table.

Good pub game - This is where its been played most so far.

The game 7 wonders takes a few cues from. Take a card and pass the rest of the hand to a neighbor.

A DEFINITE "buy"; however, try to determine which version to get. Zman version (English) is the only way to go. See pics (http://boardgamegeek.com/image/117798)


Seems to be a highly rated filler with a fast game play (20 mins), if one doesn't mind (or can get over) the anime themed cards.

http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/425779/a-different-sort-of-gateway-game

Some say it scales well from 2-5, others say that it's not worth playing with the minimum. !?

It seems that the game is played a little like Dominion and is definitely more portable; albeit less highly rated (perhaps due to anime/fantasy theme).

Worth getting, but not until we get Dominion first since I think Dominion will scratch a similar itch. However, at $10 why not get it?

[Played more than 100 times]

Few rules and some symbols create a fast but not mindless game based on drafting cards. It's light, quick and nice even if luck can have an important role sometimes.
With 5 players you know that every card will be seen, so there's a bit less randomness involved, but having so many opponents you "counter-draft" less often.
With 4 players you can opt for the interesting "team mode".
It scales well (it simply requires different tactics with different number of players).
Beautiful artwork.
Theme is nonexistent.
Fast paced. 
Quick. 
Portable (only 100 cards). 
Cheap.

[2-5] Another set collection card game but this one has a nice little twist: each player is dealt 5 cards of which he must pick one and give the rest to the player on his left.

First time we played, we started reading the rules (which are a bit criptic) without knowing what the game is about but once we started playing it all became clear.

It is a nice, fast game of cards with a nice fantasy setting and great artwork. The drafting mechanic is cool and the game has some interesting decisions. 

Also, the advanced rules (using all the cards) are really necessary, otherwise there are very few interactions between the cards.

bought on a whim 3-15-2006.  Let's see how long it takes to get around to playing it.First play 3-20-2006 as 2-person.  Not bad, but need counters instead of flipping.Second play 3-21 using counters (pennies), again two-players.  Better now with a few games under my belt I can see patterns and the central conflict: the 6-point cards generally make you flip their own suit, but leading with a "sacrificial" low-point card dilutes the points-per-card ratio.  Upping my rating.  Ok, played every day this week and it is ok.

Got board of it quickly thereafter.  Not my type of game--too abstract, with an ignorable pasted-on theme.  Traded away July 2006.

Played it a few times.  While the game has good elements in drafting (hate drafting, etc), the major issue is it does require four people to get the full experience.  Even with two or three players, the game doesn't scale well because you barely go through the deck, therefore your decisions are based more on luck than anything else.

Personally, I find Sushi Go to have the same elements as Fairy Tale although in a much simpler fashion but scales far better.

Rating based on 4 players.

I think I'm starting to realize that I'm not a fan of drafting games beyond a certain complexity, and that complexity ends around Sushi Go level. I found this one had too many things going on for my taste, as there are just so many kinds of cards. I think this problem would lessen with more plays, however.  Art was nice, but there are a lot of icons to learn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
It's a very kind game and at the same time very competitive, with indirect confrontation. My only problem with it is some important details on the cards are difficult to read with a glance from a little distance. Because this is exactly what you need to do, checking the other players cards in front of them and figuring out what they need, which is normally shown using a very small picture on the bottom of the card.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A very streamlined card drafting game. Everything runs so smoothly, and every decision you make is interesting and meaningful. It also slowly builds up tension throughout the game, which is a big plus for me.

My only gripe would be that there isn't much hidden information, so you can tell if you're going to be beat towards the end, which can make the last round or so pretty boring. Also, the game feels like it could be an extra round longer. You don't play quite enough cards to get that big feeling of accomplishment. This might be by design, but it's just slightly frustrating to me to not have enough time to see enough cards to build a coherent strategy. You're mostly at the whim of the cards you see, which is a very small percentage of the total cards available.

RATING: 8
Fairy Tale is a standard card drafting game.  In it you start with a hand of cards.  You will then pick the card you most want from that hand and keep it.  The rest of the cards you will pass to your neighbour on one side, while taking the remaining cards from your neighbour's hand on the other side.  You'll take the card you most want of those, and pass the rest again.

What you're trying to do is draft the cards that will work best together to generate the most points.  After a predetermined number of rounds the player with the most points wins.

There are some agonizing decisions to be made in Fairy Tale, as with most card drafting games.  For example, do you take the card that will really help you, or the card that won't help you that much, but will really help your neighbour?  Do you take a card that will directly benefit you, or a card that will attack other players?  Do you take a certain card now, or send it along and hope it comes back to you?

I find Fairy Tale to be a fun game.  However, there are a couple minor draw backs.  The fantasy theme is pasted on, and really has nothing to do with the game mechanics at all.  So, don't expect a rich experience that way.  Also, the symbology on the cards can be a little puzzling at first, but shouldn't take too long to become familiar with.

Overall, I highly recommend Fairy Tale if you want a nice light card drafting game that doesn't take long to play.

Just ehh. You have to be familiar with the cards, which are overly busy and difficult to decipher. "Hey, I have random cards and maybe one will beat your magic elf-rangers riding fairies." Plus, I just don't find joy in drafting games. Edit: I just put this one up for donation in the "Support BGG End of Year Drive". Great way to support BGG and get rid of games that will never again see your gaming table. One man's trash and all that...

I enjoy the concept, the drafting, and pretty much everything about this game except the theme and the cards themselves.

They made the cards readable in all languages, but then made the iconography and number placement as difficult as possible to understand.  Like seriously.

I enjoy it but can't imagine it will get more plays--trying to teach people the iconography is like pulling nails, and then they'll still forget.

Once you got over the confusing iconography and the unusual game play you find one of the best light card games. Drafting, collecting profoundly different sets, constantly evaluating your current strategy and trying to screw over others' grants a quick and intense game.

we've had this game for over a year now, and played it a lot. It's good even in two players. The game is really just built around the draft mechanic, which is  great IMHO.

Interesting. I actually think it's fairly good, but I have a nagging feeling there is less subtlety to the game than it seems. The art is cute and the odd "Engrish" isn't too distracting, though it seems common that players have a hard time with the fact that "Close All {1 fairies}" actually means "All players turn 1 fairy card face down". In any case, this also wins some points for cleverness by using a Magic: The Gathering style draft for card selection as well as a somewhat novel card flipping mechanism.

RATING: 7
Simple yet very elegant drafting-to-score card game. I like the way the rules allow for both offensive and defensive drafting by giving you 2 "spare" choices each turn. Would rather play with more cards in hand such that the same hand goes around 2 or 3 times, but that's a minor quibble. Gorgeous art. Only drawback is that it seems that the 'multiplier' strategy is easiest to pull off and thus offers significantly enhanced chances of winning.

I won't tell people the name though or they won't play!  Advanced rules really help give the game more options.  Problem I have is that you can't really focus on shutting down your opponents as you usually have to sacrifice getting cards you need so it can feel somewhat autonomous at times.  Games where there is more aggressive player interactions makes the game more fun for all I've noticed.

Played once with four people.  This is a set-collecting card game where players play cards that generate victory points.  Players obtain cards via a select-and-pass dealing mechanism (5 cards dealt to each player; each player then chooses 1 of those and passes the other 4 to the next player, etc.); as many of the cards require other cards to be present to generate points, the goal is to build sets of items.  However, building sets seems fairly difficult given the variety of cards (at least on first glance), and the game I played felt fairly random.  This might be fun to get into a bit more, but right now it's not looking up.

I bought this game because it seemed like it was about midway between Sushi Go and 7 Wonders in terms of complexity and decision-making. Having played it, my impression is that it adds extra complexity to Sushi Go (yes, I know Fairy Tale came first), but doesn't make it any more fun or interesting. In comparison, Sushi Go seems like Fairy Tale distilled down to its pure essence, and is much cleaner and simpler, and more fun to play. The "advanced game" cards of Fairy Tale don't really do much for me, except make it more random and fiddly. Honestly, I'd rather just play Sushi Go, or better yet, 7 Wonders.

Fairy Tale is a good card drafting game somewhere between Sushi-Go and 7-Wonders.  Because of the pure randomness of the deck, Fairy Tale doesn't rise to the strategic heights of 7-Wonders. Compared to Sushi-Go, Fairy Tale has a lot more going on, but the added complexity didn't make the game feel deeper or more fun.  I prefer Sushi-Go to this.

I'm not sure that I'm being fair rating this after one play with two players, but I wanted to record a first impression for my reference.  A 7 is about as low as I can see this one being ranked, with more players and more time, I can see this one ranking very high, possibly even a 9 or 10.  Unique system, different than anything I've played before.  Pretty simple once you get the hang of it.

Solid little drafting game. I brought it out at a recent games night and it was super easy to pick up and people enjoyed it. Better than Sushi Go or 7 Wonders, in my view. The art is not very helpful though (many of the dragons and warriors look the same), and it's initially hard to remember that "flip" means "turn face down" not "face up".

Somewhere between a filler and a more strategic card game (eg Citadels). The draft and play system is reasonably straight forward but the complementary scoring system is a bit confusing at first. The first game I played initially seemed like multi-player solitaire, but I imagine that with experience this would become more interactive as players watch each other's set of cards develop. The font used in the Z-Man version could have been better. Some of the graphics and icons used are also a bit confusing.

Once you have got over the learning curve and understand the symbology, then this game is fast but with sufficient depth to keep gamers interested. The interaction between the players works really well.

Played my first game of Fairy Tale today and found it to be quite satisfying.  Nice little game....not too long..nice decisions on what you draft, then play, the let be discarded.  Our game was very close 43,43,40,33 and exciting but we we're all struggling a bit to figure out all the symbols in pictures but once you get used to them it is quite straightforwas...., so above average for me....we will play it again tomorrow I suspect.

I would love to see games from Japan become more successful.  I read and write Japanese so neat to see a perfect English/Japanese game in one set....nicely done Mr. Designer whoever you are..if you ever need help translating or playtesting just let me know.

This game has had a lot of success with my game group at work.  This is lighter than 7 Wonders, but is much easier to cart around between work and home and setup time is quick.  This game was a perfect weight game between 7 Wonders and Sushi Go for card drafting so this will hit the table often.

Japanese card game with 100 cards. There are four suits and players draft cards: Deal out five cards, pick one, pass the rest on and keep selecting until you have five cards. Then play three of those cards, one at a time. Cards can flip over other cards, or open your own cards. Repeat until you have played 12 cards, then score for only those cards that are still face up. Some cards score differently depending on whether you have met certain conditions, such as most of one type, or square of the total number of a type, etc. Interesting, fun, quick game. Don't expect this to be a highly strategic game, there is a good dose of luck such as your initial draw selection,  and if your opponents play defence or not. The mechanics are neat, and decisions on which cards to collect can be tense. The 4 player partnership game is just as fun.

Very fun little drafting game. Easy to teach, with high replay value even in the same session (can easily play four games straight in an hour). Similar depth as Seven Wonders but is much quicker and has no board game components. Cards can be attacked and flipped which is a great mechanic, adding a new element of strategy within the card play order. I often prefer Fairy Tale over Seven Wonders, and willing to play it more frequently.

RATING: 6.5
The only drawback of this game is the learning curve for non-gamers but that's just becoming familiar with the icons on the cards.  

Excellent artwork, quick yet engrossing game, with a subtle way of screwing your opponents. However, I must say, the little images of the cards that are printed on cards they are related with should haven much bigger, which has caused me to only play this game with people that have good eyesight.

I haven't found a drafting game as good and quick as this one, which makes it highly valuable.

Update 1:  My girlfriend disliked it a lot, so it got traded away. I don't know exactly what displeased her about it, but she wasn't willing to play it again.

1 2 player game thus far so limited understanding.  While appearing chaotic, the short term tactical decisions are engaging.  I suspect this game would be great with 5 players.  The artwork is everything promised - beautiful - wish the cards were larger just to enjoy it better.

Why this is not a 10:
-> I know this is not a want to play all the time game
-> Currently, there are several other 2 player games I'd suggest
+ It is a good game and I would willingly play if my suggestion were turned down - I really want to try this with more people.

RATING: 3.5
It's a simple draft combo making game. It's in fact very similar to 7 wonders, you choose cards trusting that your will see some of their counterparts in the future. You might or might not see them, depending in what the others do and your luck, because not all the cards are dealed.

There's very few interaction with other players.

The game doesn't involve exciting decisions, you just choose blindly. Nothing of interest for me here.

The only thing I like is that you draft 5 cards and play 3 of them. That gives you a somewhat wide margin to draft some cards that would help your neighbour.

The good news is that the game is ultrafast. You just need 20 minutes to finish a full game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A bit different card game with a drafting mechanic. Game is a great, fast filler. It takes a couple of first games to know what kind of combinations are worth trying to collect but after that games should be fast. Works just as well with advanced/basic rules. 
Richard Garfield's team rules are worth trying. They give just enough more options for co-operation if played with teams.

Update (13.9.2007): This game just rocks! One of the best fillers. Updated rating from 8 to 9.

Update (2.7.2014) : New edition with 10 new cards was good too. Hard to say just after one game but if I ever have to renew my copy, I'd definitely get a new one. Still, Don't know if additions are worth upgrading really...

No down-time, plays fast, with a decent amount of strategy. A nice filler.

Fun little drafting game that is best with 3+ people. With 2 it does work, but then I just play with the "beginner" set of cards, which is a little bit simpler, but due to going through less cards overall, reducing the variety of cards makes collecting sets a little bit more achievable in 2 player game. 

Edit: I found out there is also an app for it and I quiet like playing it on the bus in between. 

Edit again: This one has dropped a bit for me, just because it seems to be to "in between", for a little more complexity usually 7 Wonders gets to the table and for just a small quick drafting game there is Sushi Go and somehow Fairy Tale is stuck in the middle. It's a good game though, just not on the list of stuff I want to play often anymore.

[b]Fairy Tale[/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> 6)[/COLOR]

[i]I originally bought Fairy Tale because it was supposed to be a good 2p drafting game and I didn't find that to be the case. The main reason is the amount of cards you don't see in a 2p game can create huge point swings in what certain cards will be worth. I've found that Sushi Go Party actually offers a much better2p card drafting experience.

On top of that, Fairy Tale had the same card issues as Archaeology: The New Expedition and the game play wasn't good enough to deal with it. I ended up trading our copy away.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Great theme with beautiful artwork, my daughter loves the art.

50+ plays. This has become an opener of choice due to the speed with which we can get up and going and it takes 2-5 equally well. Increased familiarity with the cards has improved scores, our awareness of options and the requirement of alertness as to what the other players are looking for to ensure appropriate card denial to the next player (which then lowers scores again!). There's not huge depth, but there are a number of known strategies we see people attempt now and having that variety is great in a 10 minute game. You see a lot of decisions on whether it's more important to keep a card for yourself or to deny a certain card to the next player. All combined with fast speed of play makes this a perpetual winner.

Excellent, excellent game.  Once you get the hang of it, everything you need to know is clearly depicted iconically on the cards.  Two-Player with Eric Martin's variation preferred.  Sleeved Japanese version and two unsleeved GMT versions.  Present to NJM; Clovis' kids; baby Jonah; MRJ.

RATING: 6
Quick and light but not super-light drafting, tableau-building card game. Feels a bit like a lighter 7 Wonders. Reasonably easy to teach, and extremely quick to play (4p learning games take 20 minutes). Definitely better with 4p than with 2 (I haven't tried any 2p variants).

The "attack" cards affect everyone, including the one doing the attack. I like that. It seems fairly random, so it would be interesting to try variants like starting with a random 2 cards in your tableau, or keeping 2 cards out of your starting hand, instead of just 1.

The Z-man font is absolutely dreadful, which is a real problem because you need to read some card names to know which cards score with which other cards. In poor light or if you have imperfect eyesight, it's going to be a real challenge. The icons are really well done, and the graphics are fine. The graphic designer must have gotten drunk before picking the font. This game would be a 7 or maybe an 8 with a better font.

Unfortunately, the What's Your Game edition eliminates the partner-card text entirely, which is even worse. Plus the icons on the WYG edition are much harder to use.

The BGG weight of 1.7 is too low. I would put the weight right around 2.0, as it's definitely lighter than San Juan, but heavier than Jaipur.

This game has become very popular with my group, when we wait for people to show up, this is all we play now.  I find the game becomes addictive.  Once you end, you feel you know what you did wrong and want to try again.  This cycle hasn't ended for me yet.

After playing this game to death while camping, I've had to reduce its score by one.  I still welcome the game but it won't stay long on the table.

RATING: 6
IMO, the graphic design gets in the way.  Many cards refer to other cards through the use of a thumbnail picture towards the bottom end.  The problem is that many of the cards, due to the artwork, look very similar when shrunk to that size.  Plus, many of the conditions on the big scoring cards are explained in very tiny font.  So it is hard enough keeping track of your own cards and near impossible to keep track of others.  When I play this, I find myself wishing I was playing Sushi Go instead.

Easy game that doesn't take very long and I always enjoy playing it.  The first game is pretty baffling, but I found that I figured it out by the second game and could appreciate what was going on.

The Garfield team variation is interesting - you get to trade a card with your team whenever one of you plays a Shadow card.

This is a CCG-style card drafting game where you're trying to get certain combinations of cards that give you the most points.  There seem to be four major strategies: cards that work with each other, cards that work with themselves, cards that are worth big points but nullify your other cards, and cards that mess with your opponents.  The game really encourages you to specialize: if two people pick the same strategy they'll probably both lose because there aren't enough cards for what they're doing.  However, if everyone is left alone, I'm not convinced that the strategies are balanced well against one another, either.  Hmm.

For some reason, I'm not a big fan of the art (Z-Man edition), but I can't put my finger on why.

Comment: Initially I was a bit underwhelmed by this game. It plays okay with 2 players and the graphic design sucks horribly. Card quality is fantastic, however and I was impressed with how simple the rules are. I like this game better than 7 Wonders for how simple and quick it is. 7 Wonders feels bloated compared to this. A nice filler, but not much more. Will bring out on occasion.

This is a very fun card drafting game. It's a step above Sushi Go in terms of difficulty but is not too heavy whatsoever. There are a few unique abilities, a couple different fun strategies to try, I also like the ability to effect other players by playing cards that force them to turn their cards face down (thus not scoring those points) as well as powerful cards you can play for yourself that force you to turn your own cards face down. This is a very fun game, if you like card games check this one out.

Nice card drafting game for two players. It is a bit like 7 wonders but since not all cards will come out it is a gamble sometimes to play some of the multiplier cards. I think this game has a good blend of luck and strategy in it. Plays fast and quick and somewhat confrontational with the attack cards but not too cut throat either since players can rescue their own card later. Game will shine with expert cards.

---- Update ----
Game is more thinky with expert cards. My fiancee complains the game is too short for 2 players because with 4 rounds we will only see 20 cards out of the 100. So I house-ruled it to be 6 rounds and with 30 cards hitting the table she is more satisfied with the game.

I enjoyed this drafting game. There's some long term planning and hosing that's possible, and some short term as well.  BUT, the cards are incredibly difficult to understand at a glance, and I basically had no inclinationwhatsoever to take stock of what anyone I wasn't immediately passing cards to had, because the symbols were so difficult to read.  Hopefully ZMan will fix this and then I'll have no qualms about it.

This is a basic drafting game where over the course of the game you draft four sets of five cards. In each hand of five, players simultaneously select, then reveal a card to play until you've played three of the five from the hand. Most of the card effects either look for other cards of specific types to qualify for scoring or they involve flipping or unflipping cards. It's cute, I don't know that it's more compelling than other lightweight drafting games like Tybor der Baumeister for example. It's somewhat odd to get a draft card turn 1 that won't score unless you find card X and card Y, when you won't see the whole deck of cards in a game.

RATING: 7
I think Fairy Tale has some unique mechanics that make it an interesting game. The strategy is a mix of collecting cards you want, using them in the right sequence, while also picking up cards your opponent wants and discarding them at the end of each round. Of course, like with most card games, there is an element of luck in getting cards you want with each draw. The "expert rules" are not that much more complex and we picked them up fairly quickly after playing 2 basic games. 

I'd really not prefer to play at any other player count other than 5 simply because only at 5 will all cards at least come into play, even if not into your hand. In a 2 or 3 player game only 40 and 60 cards (out of 100) respectively will come into play. Unless a player suffers from AP, Fairy Tale moves along fairly quickly (25-30 mins per game) and is a good fun game.

My first and only game was soured by the fact that the person who taught us the game was (a) a very experienced player and (b) taught the game quickly.

Considering how light and un-interactive this game is, I don't think it's worth my time to learn the special effects of each and every card.

very nice. players draft cards from different hands which are passed around the table in order to collect sets that will give them points after the last round. this game is easy to learn, plays quickly and has some nice room for strategy, at least with 2 players. i can see how the strategy would decrease with more players, but it plays so quickly that i can't see how that could matter in a game like this. promises to be, for me anyway, one of my more heavily played fillers.   

on a side note, i don't get the complaint about small icons. the icons at the top of the cards should be the only icons that matter to all the players, and those icons are FREAKING HUGE--they couldn't be any bigger.

An interesting card game.  Hand drafting, variable scoring, and card interaction produce an enjoyable gaming experience.  It almost feels like a CCG, but with a fixed set of cards.  However, unlike a CCG, it lacks the expansion if the core game needs a little more substance.  I'm a bit concerned that this game could use a bit more substance to keep it interesting and it may suffer from a bit too much luck.  Though, it's still a fun, quick, quality game.

RATING: 7
Fun card drafting abounds in this game.  I like the quick streamlined nature of the game, and it is just long enough to play "one more game" easily.  The advanced rules add some nice scoring chances, but may be a little too easy to fulfill. Fun game.

Something that should be apparent from the beginning of the game, but that is hard for new players to grasp, is the need to watch what your neighbors are collecting.  If you do, you soon have difficult decisions between stuff that helps you to draft versus stuff that helps your neighbor EVEN more than the card that helps you.  Ouch!

(When rating games I focus on the "how likely I am to play this game again" part of the BGG description rating, as opposed to the "quality" part of the rating.)

I hate the artwork on this game. The drafting mechanic is kind of interesting, but it feels like the cards are too balanced for it to make much of a difference. It ends up being more about set collection. I like set collection games, but I can think of a half dozen set collection games I'd rather play.

UPDATE: Played this again. If it weren't for the artwork and terrible font, this might be a 6 but no higher.

Jogo estranho, carregado de draft e com uma grande mistura de cálculo de probabilidades. Creio que o trabalho que dá para a pontuação ser feita apenas com 6 cartas, acaba por ser não muito recompensante e que com quantos mais jogadores for jogado, mais foge ao controlo do jogador. Uma desilusão!

I've so far only played this game twice. It's hard to rate accurately after just two games, as frankly in the first game none of us had much idea what was going on (and kept having to ask about cards and/or look them up), but I can see this being quite an interesting occasional game when we're all up to speed on the rules and all the cards. (The second game was a fair bit better, I'm sure by the next time we'll all know roughly what does what and know how to read the cards better.) Basically you draft 5 cards and then play 3, in 3 rounds where everyone plays simultaneously. Most cards require certain other cards to be in play to score well, but various cards when you play them put other of your cards temporarily out of play (they can be restored by certain other cards), and there are also ways to force other players to turn over (ie. take out of play) one of their cards. Certainly interesting, but I can't see this being played a lot - to play well will take a lot of concentration to know what the players either side of you are wanting to collect. And we haven't played since that second game in 2014.

rating after 2 plays (2pl) - 7/8

lot of fun - feels too short with 2pl but will look into that

rating after 5plays - all 2pl - 8

sure its a bit random but is a lot of fun - been trying 2 variants for 2pls - 1 is the 7 card draft as in the variant section - the other is to play with a 3rd dummy player and play exactly like a 3pl game just forcing the dummy to choose a random card - both are nice

rating after 10 plays (8x2pl, 2x3pl) - 8 - still our weopon of choice for 20mins 2pl game

I've only played this once and I'm waiting to give it another chance before I rate it.  It pretty much left us all scratching our heads on the first play.  It could have been because we used the basic rules, but I really saw pretty much nothing that resembled fun.  Given the Geek average rating, we must have been doing something wrong.

Edit:
I played this again with proper rules and it's very good.  When I played the first time we were applying card powers every time a card was played AND unflipped, so it was a mad flip flop fest.  I would have rated it a 3 before, but now I'm making it a 7.

Fairy Tale is a quick, fun, light card game for 2-5.  The box claims that it plays in 45 minutes, but I can't imagine a game taking much longer than 20 minutes.  Even our learning game took less than that.

The artwork on the cards is beautiful and, once you familiarise yourself with the icons, the cards are self-explanatory (even noting which cards act in combination with the cards in your hand and how many copies of those cards are in the deck).  The only drawback I've found is that the names of the cards are written in a white script that can be difficult to read for older players.

At the beginning of each round, each player is dealt five cards.  You choose one to keep and pass the remaining four to your neighbour.  You then choose one card from the four you are passed and send the remaining three to your neighbour.  This process is repeated until each player has a hand of five cards, and this is where the meat of the game is.  After the draft, all players simultaneously play one card - some cards cause others to be "unflipped" (turned face up); some cause themselves or others to be "flipped" or "hunted" (turned face down); some have no such effect.  This process is repeated twice, and each player's two unplayed cards are then discarded to end the round.  The game is played in four rounds with no recycling of cards.  Points are scored for all cards face up at the end of the game.  The majority of good scoring opportunities come from having particular combinations or sets of cards - which is why the draft is so important (though you can mess with your opponents' plans by requiring them to flip cards that they wanted face up).

Twenty of the cards in the game are marked as "advanced", and the rules recommend that you start without those cards to learn the mechanics.  When I taught my parents the game, we started with the advanced version.  I had played the basic version with friends and it felt poorly balanced.  The advanced version feels better balanced and more interesting.  Unless playing with a young child, I would go directly to the advanced game; the difference in complexity is not significant.

16-07-2014. Rated after 5 plays. Cheat, cheat.. played 3 games against the Android app AI.. but still :). Game basically is a very simple 4 round drafting game, where you draft 5 cards and play 3 cards each turn. Fun twist is that many of the different card types interact to get you points. Some cards allow you to flip your own or opponents cards face-down, to regain lost points or screw your opponent. I am not sure if I like fairy tale better than 7 wonders, I think they're very similar although I think 7 wonders may even be a little less complicated as Fairy tale.

This is a relatively simple card drafting games, between Sushi Go and 7 Wonders.  It is a good way to learn the mechanism for bigger games like 7 wonders.  It is fun in its own right if you have a good number of people and then use the expert cards.  We did play it with 2, but it isn't that great at that size.  (JW)

Not sure what to think of this game just yet. I played it twice as a two player game. The first time we made a rule mistake. The second time with the correct rules it just didn't seem too... interactive. If there were more "flip opponents cards" in the game, it would be much more strategic with the way you draft. I would like to play it with 4 players before writing this off.

--Oct2005-- Nice solid game; fairly easy to teach, and reasonably easy to play once the icons have been deciphered.
--Jan2008-- Daughter #1 (age 8) has developed a fondness for Fairy Tale.  Some of it is the card art; some of it is the interlocking card powers (which she finds fascinating); some of it is the fact that it's an interesting little game that plays in a short enough period of time that it can be squeezed in before being sent off to sleep for the night.

In my mind, this is the card drafting game in the 7 Wonders style which sacrifices depth of theme as well as some nonessential elements such as variable player powers, and gains not much but portability and a shorter playing time.  It is enjoyable, and has some of its own unique experiences (you can boldly gamble that you will get your hands on one unique card, to activate another card for big points or otherwise get nothing), but most of the time I think I'd prefer to play 7 Wonders or Among the Stars.

In Fairy Tale players will be dealt an initial hand of cards.  They will then chose one and pass the rest of the cards to another player.  This continues until all the cards have been kept.  Then players begin playing the cards they have selected.  The cards played will grant points, or will cause players to flip a card over, making it useless.  This  happens for a few rounds.

Players have to carefully consider which card they want, and which they are willing to give up, possibly never to see again.  Not all the cards in the deck will be dealt so there is always a level of uncertainty with what will be available each round.  It's a fast, fun, light game.

Abstract card game in which players try to score the most points to win.  To do so, they play cards.  Some of them have abilities that make other cards turn face down or face up.  The cards laying face down at the end of the game don't score any point.  Some other cards give points only if a certain requirement is achieved.  The way the cards are dealed is very original:  players draw five cards, take one and pass the others to the rival sitting next to them; they do so until five cards have been chosen.  Then they play three cards, apply their effects and discard two.  The manga art in the cards is a positive issue in this game and brings a nice fairy atmosphere around it.

[b]Edit (12/2016):[/b] After 5 years with this game, it doesn't see as much play. If I want a light "Pick and Pass" card drafting game, I will go with [b]Sushi Go[/b] as it's simpler, easier to teach, and goes by quickly. If I want a a slightly heavier one (but still relatively light), I will go with [b]7 Wonders[/b] (or even [b]Treasure Hunter[/b] which is also by Richard Garfield). As such, I don't really play this one anymore. That said, still a great game, just in this weird middle spot where I tend to reach for another game instead.

Did you miss those heady halcyon days of Magic booster drafts?  Then Fairy Tale is for you!  There's more to the game than what can be grokked from the rules and cards - give it a spin and you'll know if it's for you.  At first the "expert game" cards seem to add more noise than signal.

RATING: 5
Quick, fun filler, with some memorization, since it involves drafting. A twist off simply drawing cards and seeing how many points you get. There is a little bit of  interaction inherent in the drafting, but I do wish the cards were more interactive and "mean". Not quite a good game, since it seems like you really only have a few decisions to make: help myself, screw X, screw Y or screw Z. Can get too computational as a result from calculating up everybody's score.

I still play this, because I've sucked in all the games I've played, and I must understand why!

The rules are so free-form they shouldn't even be called rules. The complexity lies in the cards, and they can be a handful to go through when teaching the game, especially with the confusing iconography of the WYG edition (Z-Man's is much better).

Fairy Tale -- We got the Z-man edition cheaply -- I'm still interested in the What's Your Game edition.

Looks like What's Your Game edition has some useful tweaks, like reference numbers. (http://www.whatsyourgame.it/main.php?pagina=info2&lingua=eng&PHPSESSID&radice=GIOCHI&limit=0&cod_prog=FAIRYT)

[i]Update 2011-01-09:[/i]  [thing=68448]7 Wonders[/thing] does what [thing=13823]Fairy Tale[/thing] does, but more intuitively.  After playing [thing=13823]Fairy Tale[/thing], I felt like the game would only work if we were all comfortable with the card symbols and familiar with the cards.  With [thing=68448]7 Wonders[/thing], I feel like anyone can dive right in.

RATING: 1.5
Weird game.
- while it is a light game it takes too much time to explain the rules
- while there is some interaction, it feels like I'm playing solitaire. 
- classic card games are more fun.
- International - italian edition (I have Finnish edition, which is the same print as Italian) although beautiful looking has a severe case of iconitis for a game that light to the point of absurd. It takes more time to explain the game than play it, and the game's lightness makes this effort ultimately unrewarding. 

traded it away. Drafting bores the hell out of me and supposed interaction is too low to register on my charts. Especially there's too much rules upfront.

Overrated. This game has players drafting creatures and at the end of each round, players with the highest scores win. 2 player is boring and he who gets the power cards first wins.

4 player is better but again, not much depth in there.

Akit a Race for the Galaxy túl sok ikonja elriaszt, de szereti a kártyás játékokat és a fantasy téma kedvelője annál a Fair Tale biztos sikerre számíthat. Gyönyörűen megrajzolt kártyák, könnyű ikonrendszer és gyors játékmenet.

[2013-03-23]
Pár év után, sok játékot megismerve nem éppen az RFTG volt a legjobb összehasonlítás, sokkal inkább a 7 Wonders, persze ez később jött ki. De ehhez hasonlít a legjobban, de annál gyorsabb könnyedebb bármikor elővehető játék. Már elsőre is talál benne a kezdő is élményt, de igazán 2-3 játék után tisztul le mire lehet játszani.

Enjoyed it a bit and it was quick so would try it again, but the decision-making territory seems very sparse. I played for my own score for the most part, and there was always an obvious "best pick" card after you get your first few down -- on hands where I didn't care about the cards too much, it was obvious which one to hate-draft. So game seems like it mostly plays itself?

Passing the cards like in "7 Wonders", building a table with combination powers like in "Race for the Galaxy". With elements from two of my favourite games, it has simultaneous turns and almost no downtime, so it plays quick and you can hammer out 2-4 games in an hour. This one is a keeper.

I'm not really a fan of CCG's and this takes a booster deck drafting mechanic and turns it into something more.  The game itself is quite enjoyable.  Quick and easy with some nice little decisions.  Often times you are faced with choices to build your hand for options or to take cards others want just to bury them.  Quite nice.

I'm not sure what this has to do with Fairy Tales, which is too bad.   I like the basic game, it works fine on its own.  I'm not sure if I ever really need to play the "advanced game" it just seems to add more chaos.  All in all a great filler.

I was pleasantly surprised by Fairy Tale!  It's an interesting, quick playing card game that evokes the flavor of Magic The Gathering type of games.  The only problem with the game is that there are only a couple of small ways to affect your opponents.  Most of the time you are playing for yourself.  The game needs more cards that will affect everyone else at the table.

RATING: 4
It's not that the mechanics or the cards are boring, it's that they are much less interesting than they could have been.  The biggest obstacle to playing this game, though, is identifying which card is which.  Many of the pictures look similar at a glance and the bizarre choice of a script font that is difficult to read makes this quite a task.  Unfortunately, a number of card abilities revolve around the NAMES of cards, and not just the icons or numbers on them, which are more legible.  Altogether, this game just doesn't work.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A moderately simple card game. The cards are in several colors, and tagged with icons. You play 4 rounds where each round you first draft 5 cards (i.e., deal 5 cards to everyone; everyone keeps one and passes the rest; keep going until nothing left to pass; next round, reverse direction of passing), then you play 3 of your 5 cards (played 1 at a time, revealed simultaneously). They are each worth some number of points (1-6 mostly). Some cards only give you points if you satisfy a condition - e.g., have the most __ icons played. Some cards also have special abilities that might force you or other players to flip their just-played card or previously played cards upside down, or to unflip them. Flipped cards are discarded at the end of the round before tallying points. The artwork is nice, it plays pretty quickly, and is a fun little game where you have to pay attention to what others are playing and try to predict what they will play next (and it helps if you can REMEMBER what you passed them!).

Wonderful intro card drafting fantasy game which packs alot of depth into the time it takes to resolve.  If you don't have time for 7 Wonders but want a deck builder with tough choices and complexity, this is it.  The frayed nerves resulting from the simultaneous selection half of the game more than makes up for any lull in the draft selection half.  It's great to think of the game as a balance between a homogenous deck vs. a diverse deck.  Too diverse, and the cards won't give you enough points.  Too homogenous, and you expose yourself to being ruined by having your card combos flipped and rendered null and void.   I also love the classic fantasy theme and art work - I want to live in this little world as well as play in it.

Many nice decisions in less than 30 mins. make this a great filler.

[Z-man 2005 edition] {Fantasy, filler; drafting, set collection, simultaneous action, partnership; optimal 4-6p} {5.5 basic rule, 6.0 expert rule, 6.5 team-play w/ Richard Garfield's variant} Fairy Tale is a nice card game with little down time and nice player interaction. It's a good lunch game for its short playing time and small size. Since each player knows most of the cards in a round, it could become a double-guessing game. Players have to guess how other players act to avoid their cards being flipped. Although it uses drafting, the luck is fairly strong because one has to bet on what cards he can get in future rounds. Luck is particularly strong in 2/3p game, one could collect sets of cards from his initial hand already.

The cards are very pretty, colorful and sturdy. They are informative enough without the need of referring to the rules. And players have enough information to quickly calculate which cards he needs. A card game should always be produced like this. 

Expert rules shall always be played. A geek has proposed a very good variant for a 2p game: each player has 10 cards at beginning, keep 1 and discard 1 each turn. (This is similar to Citadel 2p variant). This actually works and is quite funny for 2p.

RATING: 6
Nice quick little drafting game.  Other than drafting, there is fairly minimal interaction, but the drafting plays such a significant role in the game that it doesn't feel like multi-player solitaire.  You are given enough space in your hand to effectively hate-draft (unlike, say, Notre Dame, where you can only spare one space for a card you don't need), and the few interaction cards (that make opponents flip cards or "hunt") keep the game lively enough as cards are played.  I will say there's a learning curve on this one, it's hard to play effectively when you don't know the cards very well and how they interact.  Thankfully, drafting is alternated in direction, so you have less of the "Winner is sitting to the left of the new person" effect.

4/23/10: After a long break and coming back, Fairy Tale is a nice filler but a lot less impressive than I thought when I was first getting into games.  Basically, there is little to no game here without the drafting; this isn't a [b]problem[/b] per se but does make it a bit of a one-trick pony that eventually wears off.  Still, for filler, it isn't bad.

I really like the card drafting mechanic.  I also like the card interactions.  Pretty artwork and a reasonably quick playing time also help make this a pretty good game.
Works well across the range of 2-5 players.  Simultaneous play means that adding players doesn't significantly prolong the game although it does slightly alter odds of drafting a card you need since there's more chance for one of the others to take it first (balanced by the fact that with fewer players more cards will be left in the deck unseen by any player at all).

Fairy Tale scratches a big CCG-related itch for me.  I've always been a huge fan of draft formats and I think Fairy Tale does it better than any other game I've played yet.  Sure, 7 Wonders plays more people, but Fairy Tale beats it for a lot of reasons including portability, space required to play, and 2-player quality.

RATING: 6
An enjoyable card-based game. It's quick and easy to play and the artwork on the cards is simply gorgeous. There isn't a huge amount of strategy involved but you do have to give a fair bit of consideration regarding which cards to pick and then play (as well as your opponents') as you attempt to collect points from your cards, some of which are reliant on you having already played other related cards. You don't have a great deal of control over which cards you have in your hand at any one time, which means that there's quite a bit of luck involved in the final outcome. It's definitely a fun game to play though.

Surprising good little cardgame. Plays really fast. Has two phases: drafting and gameplay.

Gameplay is ok, just build up your empire and see what happens. Nothing really special here.

It shines mainly through its drafting mechanism though. Try to build up combinations but prevent others to build up theirs. If you like 7 Wonders but could do without the resource and building fluff, this is the game for you.

Great little filler game for the really short waits!

[EDIT] Broke it out with my game group but it fell flat. And that is the end of all filler games.

For sale as well!

After a few plays, I can see the use of many of the cards.  Fantastic game with 2 if you use a variant.  Only takes about twenty minutes, and everyone is involved the whole time since there is no downtime.

The card-drafting mechanism is rare enough (only this and 7 Wonders has a "pick one, pass the rest" as the main mechanism) that I actually designed my own game that takes Fairy Tale into a slightly more complex realm.

This is an excellent card drafting game with many paths to victory.  For a short playing time, it packs a ton of tough decisions, many of which are whether or not to counterdraft.

If you can set up a trade that benefits both players, happiness ensues.

I'm a big fan of drafting games, and I've played quite a few.  However, I find [thing=68448][/thing] a bit too complicated for what it offers.  [thing=133473][/thing] makes drafting simple and approachable, but takes it a bit too far towards simplicity.  I think Fairy Tale hits the sweet spot.  Simple enough that you can teach it in 5 minutes, but heavy enough to create space for strategy.

I also enjoy the mechanic of drafting cards, then playing cards.  [thing=158812][/thing] takes a similar approach, but this feel like more of a pure drafting game.  Plus, it's infinitely smaller than [thing=68448][/thing], which is a big win in my book.

Fairy Tale is a filler based solely on card drafting.  After four rounds of passing cards, you hope to have the best hand left.  The cards are a train wreck in the Z-Man edition: beautiful anime paintings overlaid with primitive fonts and jarring b&w icons.  The WYG edition is gorgeous.  It takes a full game to decode the symbols, but after that, Fairy Tale is a delightful puzzle.

The next level from Sushi Go and the jump is well worth it.  This game needed very little help in becoming our play groups number one filler.  Fairies and Dragons are an easy sell when the drafting mechanic is used.  What can I say WOW and possibly the best game I own when it comes to return on investment.  That's right this puppy was under 15 dollars, $13.99 to be exact.  Has an expansion that you can remove to make the game a little easier to teach but our group sell "hell no" give me the whole experience.

I liked this at first, but after a couple more plays, I found it be a little boring. It's difficult to explain for how short it is, and the theme doesn't come through at all.

Nice little filler, with both card drafting & set collection. Not the most accessible to new players with the expansion cards that were included in the base set. They do however add a lot in terms of strategy & also add a push your luck element to the game. I find the artwork fine, although the iconography on the cards doesn't really help with teaching the game. This being said it does play very quickly if everyone has played before, and also scales well with all player counts.

A grim fairy tale - for me at least.  Don't get the hype and the graphic design is a borderline deal breaker.

This one may take longer to teach than it does to play - which in the end - isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Some fresh ideas are buried beneath the rubble of the often confusing game play....

....So you wait in anticipation as the opponent to your right prepares to present you with a hand of cards -   that for all intents and purposes - may have just been freshly removed from a paper shredder and haphazardly been put back together in a seemingly random fashion.  There's no time for fun just yet - it is time to decipher just what it is that you are looking at.....and time to bemoan the fact that you absentmindedly left your decoder ring at home by the kangaroo on the night stand.

Take a deep breath - and try your level best to control your quivering hand as you reach for a card,  or at least what looks like a card......

One of my first game purchases and still a great game.  A top 5 filler game for 2-4 players.

While the art on this game is gorgeous, I was not impressed by how it plays. This game utilizes the same drafting mechanic found in 7 Wonders (which I dislike) and the strategy relies primarily on each player trying to build or block card combinations to maximize points. That it has 4 phases and takes up a ton of space (20 card spaces on the table for each player) just feels like too much for what it is. My wife enjoyed it more but my daughter didn't care for it at all (although she too enjoyed the art).

Its anaconda poker with added bells and whistles which detract from the game, instead of improve upon in.  Anaconda creates control by seeing your final product which results in your gain/loss.  Fairy Tale is an unnecessary invention.  I'll take Anaconda Poker every day and twice on tuesday.

Very, very nice. A slightly heavier filler, needing about 20 minutes or so I would guess, when played by experienced players. I like the drafting mechanic, and the fact that the game builds in the ability to hurt opponents by taking cards that you'll never get to play anyway. Furthermore, it's non-confrontational and has nice art.

The 2-player game is rather different. Good in its own way, though probably not quite as good as the 4-player version.

RATING: 8.5
Z-Man games purple box version.  Card drafting with set collection.

Plays simpler than the intimidating icons.  Constant, simple, decisions to make.  Each game is slightly different in what cards you will see, which increases replayability.

But, new players need a 2nd game before they start to understand it.

RATING: 7
Fairy Tale is a card drafting game. There's 110 cards in the deck, but you only play with a subset of those cards. The game lasts 4 rounds. Each round you darft 5 cards and the play 3 (at least in the 2 player game). Everyone selects their first card and simultaneously reveals, the repeat. Cards stay in your tableau until the end of the game.

There's all sorts of cards. Some give you a point for every one of those you have. Some give you points if you have one or more particular cards. Some give you points equal to thee times the number of some other card you have. Some give you points for having the most of a suit, or a symbol, etc.

My first play was overwhelming. There's a lot of cards and keeping track of what they all did was a little much. Also, it's hard to remember what other card a particular card scores for. So you have to pay attention to the fact that your opponent has elves and wants a bard (which is hard to tell by looking at the card upside down). Knowing what cards combo with other cards would help a lot and is something you only learn over time.

It was quick and I liked it, but I feel like I'd need to play it several more times before it really clicks.

RATING: 8
It is a good game.

The action is very similar to the, now, much more well known 7 Wonders. However, it is an easier game to teach and to have a good grasp on what to do. That happens because the are less options and no cost to use cards - you just need to choose the one is better for you.

For a [i]really[/i] fast game of choose-your-card-and-pass-the-rest, this is it.

RATING: 6.5
Well, I can see why this isn't as popular as 7 Wonders (the game that prompted me to try this). Mediocre samey art and card design that impedes gameplay, even less connection to its theme than 7W, and most irritatingly, naive rules that are full stop incomplete, with no decisive answers to be found even on BGG.

The art is really annoying. Shrunken versions of the card art is used to show dependencies, and I don't trust myself to judge what actually matches the picture. I have to look at the card number.

The game isn't bad though. Draft 5, then play 3 (order of play mattering). Basically you'll come up with some synergy to aim for, or cards with goals on them to aim to satisfy, and spend the rest of the game working on that.

When playing cards there is a type of interaction that 7 Wonders doesn't currently have: Cards can be "closed" so that they don't count for anything (until/unless the owner manages to "reopen" them later). These cards also attack the player using them, which may or may not be irritating to them depending on which card colors they've been collecting or depending on. Interesting.

The game feels more luck-based than 7 Wonders. My least favorite is a type of card which gives you a bunch of points if you have another, rare card. If you already happened to play that card, happy birthday. Otherwise you're probably out of luck.

Thematically the draft still (i.e. as in 7W) makes no sense, but the segregated phase where cards are actually played feels OK. It sort of feels like you have some supply of "units" (though not all cards represent something animate) that need to be either used or not used, and in some order, potentially butting heads with the other players.

RATING: 6
Drafting is very fun, but after playing this game i feel like drafting needs to be a mechanic that is a part of a greater game. When the whole game is card drafting, the game needs to be a filler. Which this is! So thats good, but i feel like the balancing decision in card drafting between your needs and your opponents need are not emphasized due to the games bad graphic design.

RATING: 7
A fine quick 4- or 5-player game. After a few plays of getting to know what cards are out there, selecting the cards to keep and to play is pretty interesting. It can be at the mercy of a poor drafter though, so it's best with people of roughly equal skill.

RATING: 8.25
A fun, quick drafting and collecting game. Cards interact with each other, and there are four factions to mix and match. The art is fair, and the design is fair, but the production quality is pretty high. For the price, this is a great filler worth buying. There is a bit of learning to do as you learn the deck, but after about 2-3 plays, you should be familiar enough with the cards and how to interpret them. I'm hoping that the game will get picked up by a different publisher in the future for a better-looking reprint. With the standard of quality set by MTG, this game really ought to look more polished.

I had no idea I was building a story, just thought I was collecting cards to get the most points.  With the take one, pass the rest, I'm not sure you can really afford to be keeping what the player you are passing to wants and deny keeping the card you want.  Would play again, but not going to ask for it!

Lovely little card game that which has you build a tableau over 4 drafting rounds, scoring based on various combinations of cards. Very simple to grasp but a fair bit of strategy with trying to withhold/flip important cards in other players' tableau.

Played this game at least 10 times with 3, 4 and 5 players and it is soooo addictive! It could be its great art, its easy to explain rules, its intelligent drafting system or its perfectly suitable game length, but something really, really impresses me about this game. Perfect filler, but I will have no problem playing this the whole evening.
UPDATE: After playing this game another 40+ times, I settle my rating for this game on an 8.5. The game proved to be popular with gamers as well as nongamers (even though it can be difficult for them to grasp all the different icons on the cards initially), and I have purchased a replacement copy of it to be on the safe side. I purchased the WYG 1st edition, because I find that the words used in that version are more intuitive than the icons used in the 2nd edition). Even after the release of 7 Wonders (which I also own and like), there is still a special place in my collection for Fairy Tales. The best "filler" cardgame I own.

My order came from Japan more quickly than I expected.  It was only like 5 business days.  The icons are extremely simple, and I do not understand the comments from people who claim they are hard.<br/><br/>I have played the basic game twice with 2 players and the advanced game once with 4 players.  The basic game is a good way to introduce the game, but it should be played once as an introduction, and then you should move on to the real game.  The score has been close every time, and the gamplay is very interesting.  Every time you pass the cards, you worry about if you will be given what you need, and if you are giving away something you shouldn't.  Your choices get harder as you play because you have to worry about what everyone has, but the game still moves quickly.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A clever drafting card game that makes 7 Wonders obsolete (even though Fairy Tale came first). Fairy Tale plays faster and has more interesting decisions per minute by far. There is also more opportunity for creative play and risk-taking, while 7 Wonders seems more like rote optimization (card A will give me 9 points while card B gives me 7, but card B will give my opponent 12 points...)
For whatever reason, Fairy Tale is exactly what I wanted from a card-drafting filler.

Fairy Tale is a small little card game that might just be a bit heavier than a "filler". The artwork is fantastic in my opinion, but you must like the Japanese style that it is in (not quite anime though). The card game itself is easy to learn and uses the drafting mechanic to take a card and then pass the rest on. It can get a bit mathy to try to maximize your points by calculating out combos of cards and this can slow things down. Once you've played it a bit, things start to pick up.

Was a bit of a surprise for me as I had started to give up on drafting games.  This game forfeits the ease of explanation of Sushi Go! for more interesting options and decisions.  Many different point combo's to shoot for, a building tableau that other players can attempt to block you from.

I liked that there was leeway in cards that you could draft that you didn't have to play allowing for more flexible hate-drafting and flexibility.  I do wish that there was somewhat of a carry-over between rounds though, think that would be even more dynamic.

A solid card-drafting game overall.

Pure drafting-for-VP game, only works with 4p*.

[+] easy to teach, short game, fast paced, very pure and streamlined...
[-] ... but not very deep; 7 Wonders does it better by offering multiple distinct path to victory (and just not the same cards in different suits)

* FairyTales only works with 4p (or 5p with adv cards). In any other configuration, you don't know if the cards will come into play so you can't make any intelligent decision and just take chances with no purpose. 7 Wonders solved this issue by adding/removing cards for a given number of player to keep the balance.

I really like this game. It plays quickly and after one or two rounds of drafting it starts to make sense to whoever I'm teaching it to. Fantasy just happens to be my favorite theme as well. New players always think the game is about making a story but it isn't. You want to draft the cards that will give you the most points. You could make a story out of what you draft but that's totally up to you and not a game condition.

My 3 rating applies specifically to the Z-Man Games edition with the absolutely horrible graphic design which makes the game nearly unplayable for new players (the illustrations are good, but the card layout and icons are moronic). However, I suspect that the actual game is much better than that (probably not great, but at least acceptable) given a sensible graphic design. Would like to play again but only the newer Whats Your Game edition or the very nice fan-remake - I will never ever play the awful Z-Man Games edition again. All copies of that should be destroyed.

The drafting element of the game, combined with the 2-discard rule and the way that the cards interact, makes this a GREAT game.  Highly addictive.  It will definitely take new players a game or two to get the inter-relatedness of all the cards, and the tension of the game comes from paying attention to the cards of the other players, and not passing them what they need while you keep what YOU need.  The box says it plays 2 or 3, but really, it's best with 4 or 5.

RATING: N/A
Ancient and wise Dragons, sweet Fairies, dreadful Vampires, brave Knights! All the ingredients for a great Fairy Tale are there; can you use them to tell the story?
\13\\13\
A preliminary game phase involves a few card exchanges with the other players, during which you must build your hand and try to deduce your opponents’ status. Afterwards, the real confrontation follows, where you must try to play the best card combinations to gain the maximum bonuses depicted on the cards.
\13\\13\
To achieve the victory, you must make crucial choices from many options: do you force your opponents to lose their most useful cards, or concentrate on improving your own situation? Try and achieve the highest (and most risky) bonuses, or be happy with the lowest (but safest) bonuses? Also, beware of some side effects: at the end of the game, only the cards facing up will be used in calculating scores.
\13\\13\
Fairy Tale is a very quick and involving game which centers around a very simple mechanism, but also creates countless opportunities for clever, tactical card play. Only the player who best uses these tactical options will achieve victory.
\13\\13\
One thing is for certain: you will not be easily satisfied with one match only!

A fairly inexpensive and fun little card game that features a neat drafting mechanic. It's sort of the pre-cursor to all of the recent tableau building games. Everyone draws a hand of cards, plays one card face down, passes it left or right (depending on which round it is) and when everyone's done, the cards are revealed and trigger effects which bounce around the table. It's quick, deceptively deep and a blast to play.

RATING: 7
Solid drafting game with loads of ways to score. Theme is difficult to sell people on, which is funny because it's completely painted on. Some of the best enabling of hate drafting I've ever seen since you're drafting 5 cards and only playing 3. It can get MEAN.

RATING: 8
Nice representation of a Magic the Gathering booster draft, but with a limited card pool that's much easier to explain to newbies. Gameplay lasts only 20 minutes, if that, but I'd avoid playing with only 2 people because the direct back-and-forth pasing of cards creates little tension over who chose what.

Amazingly quick.  Theme is pretty much pasted on,  but its a good excuse for lots of big, colourful art.  Subtle card interaction,  and the usual drafting "do I take what helps me or deny my opponents what they want" decisions.  

It's a little tough to teach, what with all the different card types,  and since the game is short,  there's not all that much time to "learn the ropes".  A second game is easy and fast,  so I recommend at least banking on two games before teaching.

Won as a prize in a luck-based draw at the end of year get-together at our local gaming club. Enjoying it less the more I play it. Keep on wondering if there should be more to it...It's as if they made a great mechanic, great card set, and then made a fantasy-themed version of Uno...

simple but at first time the symbols aren't so easy to grasp. at the end of the first game everyhing is clear.
the game itself is pretty thin and tasteless. the interesting decisions aren't that interesting and i can't see different paths to victory: just take the best u can take from the hand u r dealt.
best part about the game, it ends quickly

Edit: after my second game i would say it is not that bad but still, yes, there aren't many interesting decisions and you can't keep control of what other ppl are doing, lest you make it a really boring game.

Comments copied from other users:

"Crazy card game where the thousands of ways to score can make your mind revolve needlessly. Its not that bad really, but it feels like it. The main mechanic in this game is the 'counter draft' to get more points. The blind bidding part kind of feels unnecessary so all your decisions are 'what cards do I keep and what cards do I pass'. The symbols on the cards are confusing. This one is way to much for what it is. "

"Beautifully illustrated, but suffers from usability problems. The iconography takes some time to get used to. Once you understood their flow, they were comprehensible, but it took some time. Basically, it is a card passing game, but jazzed up with plenty of special cards and themed sets to accumulate. It is a decent simple game, but the weird iconography and price do not balance out the good-looking cards."

I've played 7 Wonders more than 20 times, it's a game I really enjoy because of how quick it plays with all player counts. Fairy Tale manages to do the same thing, but it takes a third the time of 7 Wonders (which is already very short). It's shorter because it never added resources, it has fewer card placements (12 vs 18) and there's no housekeeping in between it's four rounds (unlike 7 Wonder's housekeeping at the end of it's three ages).

If there's anything I don't like about the game it's the art. It does nothing for me, and I'd rather have a theme (pasted on is fine here) like 7 Wonders or anything else even. The Japanese anime fantasy style does nothing for me, nothing.

This game has beautiful art and simple rules that (aside from the scoring) take little time to explain, yet it allows for meaningful decisions. It plays quickly, it handles up to five players (unlike Morels), and it's small enough to be carried to game meetups easily, so it's likely to get a lot of use. Also: Baby dragons! I'd probably rate it a 10 if only A) it didn't have attack cards and B) the scoring rules were less complicated.

RATING: 6
I like the theme and the artistry. I also like the drafting mechanic. But I did not enjoy this game, overall. Perhaps it is best played with more than two. I found it difficult because most of my hands depended on my being able to receive other cards (i.e. the hand was full of asterisk cards) but I had no idea if they would be coming in a future hand or never or in what amounts... I just did not do well at this game and its strategy was beyond me. Also, as always, I'm not good at maintaining a strategy for myself while trying to block my opponent or wrecking his strategy. So that didn't help but my biggest pet peeve was just that I didn't get how to play without knowledge of upcoming cards- it seems too random to be strategic?

Card drafting, set collection card game. Make combos exploiting and mitigating come into play effects. The signature mechanic is cards get removed from play when turned face down and vice versa.

I like it better than the basic 7 wonders, it's just a bit more strategic and less expensive for sure. It works really well with 2 players, since the draft is more tactical. With 5 player the draft is more random, but you get to see a lot more cards, so it works really well either way. 5 players also don't really slow down the game since selection and play is simultaneous.

Quite a nice little card game with lots going on.  Play is as fast as the slowest player in choosing one card out of a set of 5 or less.  The first choices are which cards to draft (What would score me points? What would score them points?) and the second choices are which cards to play (What scores me points?)  Very nice graphics, once you get how the graphics work.  Great card game.

Nice little card game. The drafting system is very clever; it takes the "pass cards to the left" rule from hearts, etc., and builds a whole game out of it.

Great game. Light, but involves enough strategy to be fun and very replayable with different outcomes each game. Very solid, clear-cut rules, interesting mechanics and plays very well with just 2 people. Also involves a bit of treachery, which, for me, makes for an even more enjoyable game! In the words of my boyfriend "probably the most involved 10-minute game I've played". I second this. It IS involved, more so than many card-based games I've encountered, and it certainly makes one think hard about what combinations they can make while also trying to successfully thwart their opponent's ability to reap the maximum benefits from their cards they've placed.

I took a while to get my head around the rules but once I got that down I started really enjoying this game. I suspect this will have a long run as a filler. I like how fast the games are.

A relatively easy game to pick up, despite the confusing looking card layouts.  Once you become familiar with the few different card types (the big point, all or nothing, 2 and 3 card combos, and the various * cards that increase in value the more you collect), the game seems far too simplistic.  I wished I was playing MTG instead.

I really like the drafting mechanic, but found the art (in the Z-Man version) squeezed into a cluttered, ugly frame with the large icons. The strategy eludes me. Despite feeling that I make good personal and defensive drafting positions, I tend to come in last. There's something about the game that I just don't get. I'm not good at games requiring memory elements, and I can never remember what's missing from a hand being passed to me to deduce who has drafted what cards, etc.  [UPDATE] The more I play, the more I do like it, and can appreciate the larger, blocky icons to easily see what other players have. Very fun with 3 or 4.

Card drafting is a wonderful mechanism, and it is the key focus of Fairy Tale. It is implemented very well, in how you not only pass a hand of cards back and forth between players, but you also see each player's growing tableau and are faced with tough decisions of whether to pass a certain card or not. This is a meaty filler that you likely will want to play multiple times in a row.

I love this as a 2-player game, and have also enjoyed my 3-player plays, but have yet to play it with 4 or 5.

The expert rules (the 20 advanced cards) really add a lot to the game, and I recommend that you add them as soon as you feel comfortable with the base game, but not to include them from the get go.

This cool drafting game predates the current glut of drafters out there and has some differences that make it a great next step game if you want something with more depth than the likes of Sushi Go or Best Treehouse Ever.  In fact its a nice alternative to things like 7 Wonders too as the card play is different (collect all your draft cards then decide what to play and what order each round) and more interactive (a lot of cards can effect other players when played).  Now... I had more trouble grokking the scoring symbols than I remember having with 7 Wonders... but I think that's more the rules' fault than the symbols.  All in all a very cool drafting game I'm looking forward to exploring more!

Best filler I've played so far.  There is just something fun about Fairy Tale, especially the cards you can play to screw other people's effort in collecting for their sets (there should be more of them in the game).  The card drafting is both a source of frustration and triumph, the decision to deny cards to your neighbors or to keep what you can use, the hope that what you passed away may come back again, all of them make Fairy Tale very enjoyable, so much so that we played it three times in a row.

Great art and good fun, what more can you ask for from a card game?

Fairy Tale has struck a chord with me.  It's addictive and absolutely wonderful to play.  I can't think of a more perfect 15 minute game, nor can I imagine a time when I would ever not want to play it.  Mind you, this may be my "honeymoon phase" of Fairy Tale, so take everything I'm saying with a grain of salt and wait for the update.

Update: Fairy Tale was one of my first post-Hasbro/Parker Bros card games and it was comparatively wonderful.  I've played many more--and far superior--drafting games since then, I realize that I need to drop this from a 9 to a 7.  Decent but no great shakes.

An excellent game, especially good at bringing people into the hobby that mostly play Magic. Fairy Tale allowed me to introduce a father-son into a game they could both play that didn't require the father to get involved into Magic as his son was heavily into it while providing a means for the dad to understand why his son loved Magic so much. Plus, it didn't require the time and investment that Magic does, which means its easier to bring to the table for a quick game and it plays more than 2 which means the other siblings and mom can join in as well. A win-win for the son who just wanted his parents to know how much fun gaming can be.

RATING: 5
After 1 Play: This seems like something you'd have to play a lot to really understand and enjoy the strategy.  I'm just not sure the end result would be worth it, because the game doesn't seems all that interesting.

After 2+ Plays: I retract my previous comment.  I don't think playing a lot would lead to any greater depth of strategy.  There are a lot of different ways to get points, but in the end the game boils down to picking one of those options and hoping you get passed the right cards.

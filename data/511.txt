A diamond in the rough perhaps? I think there's a good game buried here but it's hard to tell, as is it's pretty terrible, as bad as any solo game. I guess I hold onto it because I think it is salvageable and could be great with some tweaks. Where to start? A track diagram to replace the hideous map, some auction mechanics to replace roll-offs for disputes, the random punitive cards removed would be some obvious improvements.

Update: No not salvageable. I regret wasting my time on this one.

I did not believe that I would even remotely enjoy this title. 

Surprise! What a FANTASTIC train game! While I'm well-aware that this is nothing like an 18xx game, it has certainly provided me with some impetus to give one a shot. With 1830 to be released in the near future, this is certainly a possibility.

I have two quibbles about this title: First, the components are weak. It wouldn't have cost much more to do a nice job with this. Second, all of the dice rolling tends to drag things out... but in an interesting way. Still, in spite of this, the game is a wonderful and frustrating experience (in a good way!) that is incredibly immersive.

Game with simple mechanic but very hard to master.  You have to determine where your surveyor goes since you can only build in good weather.  The market can be quite brutal if you were stuck with goods that are bottom out.  The key is getting the passenger run to operate once you are able to complete the tracks.

Tentative rating based on 1 2-player game.  Rating may go up.  I think that 3 or 4 will be the sweet spot for this game.  

I was a little disappointed with how fiddly this game was. I think that if I was playing with more players or with adults that would be more forgivable, but not in a 2 player game with a 12 year old.  This game also requires sharp elbows.  I wasn't playing aggressively enough, and the 12 year old trounced me in the basic game.

There's a spreadsheet in the files section, and I think that's going to be pretty much mandatory for the advanced game.

Well, I was certainly put off by the lack of player interaction.  Real fiddly mechanics to do some simple things.

Great game!  Basic game is within reach for middle schoolers, yet has enough decision points to keep an adult happy.  Advanced rules add complexity to suit your taste.  Really hardcore could graft a stock trading segment on as in 1830.  But for me, this puts 1830 and Railroad Tycoon back on the shelf.  Best RR game ever!

Oh.  Do download the map from this site.  Having a big map is a huge help!

May 2009.  Well I'm waffling a bit.  Not sure how many "real" decisions there are, best move usually seems pretty obvious, so to some extent game is playing itself.  I'm downgrading to an 8

Jul 2010: Dropped it to a 7 because I've pulled 1830 back out and really like that game!

April 2012:  I'd add Bullfrog Goldfield as serious competition in the RR/Mining game category

8 plays.  Long & lots of luck.  Initially, I really enjoyed this game of route-building, commodity speculation and pick-up-and-deliver... but after a few more plays, I have grown to hate the randomness... especially since the game takes several hours to play (assuming you play the full 24 turn game to balance out the luck and make certain passenger routes worthwhile).

This is a great game.

For me it is like other train games--- very therapeutic.  I got to play the second edition I believe on two occasions and am looking forward to trying the edition with the added southern areas.

I love the market aspect which has four differing goods.

A silver and gold are more of a gamble as your source of goods can become depleted more easily.  

Also there is the constant feeling of being one day late and a dollar short.  This kind of "had wringing whilst your opponents decide their strategy crates a welcome tension which I think creates excitment.

The winter aspect which can deny you income in cities during one of every four turns is one more thing you have to manage.  Those missed 6 turns can be the whole difference between a win and a loss.

Getting routes you want is a race.. and there are trade offs for your race...You can't drive so hard that you neglect to plan beyond certain desitinations.

I have only played 3 players so my opinions are based on this.

More work than play, far too long (4+ hours) for the amount of luck (dice for mining, dice for resolving disputes, dice for snow-plows, dice for price changes), exceptionally fiddly (lots and lots of tiny counters), unwieldy market mechanism (roll one or more dice with different modifiers for each market), ugly material (cluttered map, tiny single-colored cardboard counters, cards look like written with a type writer), overalll bad usability (see examples before, furthermore e.g. no orientation help at all on claims or passenger routes)

Great game for 2 players, play the "Golden Spike" variant (in the Mayfair edition, play without the southern map area/claims that corrosponded to the Two Wolf expansion). Still good at 3, but starts to degrade quite rapidly with each additional player beyond 3 (well, 2 really). Also the Campaign Game is the one to play, so block out the time. My wife an I quite enjoy the 2-player version; at this point, though I don't think I'd play with more..

Playable and interesting without being demanding. A very easygoing game of prospecting and tracklaying.

I've played and rated the Two Wolf version. The Mayfair edition extends the map and changes some of the pricing structures. I think Gold is king in the Two Wolf game, far less so in the later version.

RATING: 8
The best train game I've come across, when played with a few house rules (open auctions for disputed claims, grades and routes).  

Much of a player's turn can be performed concurrently with others (claim production especially), speeding things up considerable and reducing downtime to nil.  There's a lot of dice to roll, and each player should have a pair (use a dice tower too), but logical use of the IDN can eliminate which commodities need to be rolled (example, if the IDN is 4 all cities which haven't received any coal and have max'ed out coal prices do not have to be rolled).  Despite the dice rolls, the market forces are better simulated here that in any game I've played, and much less "gamey" than in other pickup and deliver Euros.  I also play without the money, using a scratch pad and calculator - again really speeds things up.

Yes, you will fight for claims that go bust on their first turn - just like in the olden days :-)  Pay attention to the claim's production chart, play the odds . . . just like in the olden days!


This is one of those games people can't seem to describe without mentioning luck and die rolls.  I usually hate both, but I don't see any problem here.  Why?  Through intelligent planning: optimizing your rail network's position, obtaining sources of all commodities, claiming sources beneficial to your opponents for no other reason than to deprive them, acquiring passenger routes and their guaranteed revenue streams . . . the role of luck takes a backseat - exactly as it should to add historical color, variability, and replayability to the game.

The probability of mines going bust, as well as what they'll produce when they produce is all spelled out on their card . . . this isn't a luck fest, it's simple probability, and more importantly the probability is public knowledge.  I'm sure the miners of yore would have loved to know the odds as we do here.

Further, with a little thought you can limit the die rolling.  If you're not playing a scenario near El Paso, take its markers off the commodities board, don't roll any dice for it until someone declares their intent to build towards it.  Have one player roll the dice accounting for IDN and commodities delivered, they announce the modified roll result to another player who checks the table on the commodities sheet and moves the marker.  A 6-8 result for Coal is always no change . . . it'll become second nature quickly.

Maybe the final reason I find dice are not an issue in this game is that their use seems logical to me, at times even elegant.  For example, rail lines have a "distance" indicating how long or difficult they are to traverse.  The amount of commodities a train can haul (in the advanced game) is equal to the locomotive's capability divided by this distance.  If you try to survey and build two sequential rail lines in one turn, you have to roll the a number higher than the distance of the second line on two dice to be successful in laying it's track that turn.  Odds are you'll fail to build a sequential line that's a 7 or 8.  To plow the line in winter requires a roll of the line's distance or greater on one die after modifications granted by snow plows, so given the route you can figure it's odds of being cleared.  Lines have one property "distance" that's used in several, logical ways.


All this having been said, it helps to immediately "trick out" the game with better components, cubes for commodities, meeples for surveyors, etc.  A larger map by 50% would have been nice, as would better artwork and larger text.  Being interested in Colorado history and/or railroading is a big plus. Rocky Mountain railroad or mining buffs will love this game.

4/10 - Components out of the box
7/10 - Game play out of box
8/10 - Game play with house rules (auctions, concurrent production)
8+/10 - Game play with house rules, if you're at all interested in the history of mining and railroads in the Western US.

This is the Mayfair Games edition which is a re-done game of the Two Wolves version.  It is a very solid railroad game and more forgiving than the original 1991 version.  Game mechanics are different from most other rail road games and if as a gamer you want more game flow to be a decent simulation competition of the era with having to balance expansion vs money at your disposal vs where best to expand your line vs which mines are apt to give you longevity whilst providing the tantalizing option of opening up mines that might dry up over night - then this game is for you.

This is a really neat game. The bits are outdated but the game play is great.
It is an economic train game. I love Ticket to Ride, I love Union Pacific, this game is one step further to more complicated and fun.

Set Up Notes:
-Place Black Cubes on the Start space of the Selling Price Chart.
-Shuffle the Claims deck and reveal 8 cards that are not event cards. Shuffle Event Cards back into the deck.
-Shuffle the passenger cards and create 8 stacks C on the bottom, B in the middle and A face up on top.

Rules Notes:
-Surveyors are placed to build more track. May only be placed if it connects to track or starting city of that player.

Best, overall railroad game.  A labor of love for the late Phil Smith, it combines scouting for the optimum paths through the Rockies with investment in the mines and passenger routes, the troubles of snow-removal, the return of goods to market, and the fluctuations of commodities prices based on supply and demand.  It is a masterpiece, albeit one that requires a decent time investment by the players.

A great game that "feels" like a train game and is presented in a thematic and meaningful way.

Silverton combines well thought out gameplay with lots of options for advanced play, along with excellent solitaire scenarios, and easy setup and adjustments for winning conditions.

Silverton doesn't feel like Empire Builder or Age of Steam, of which both of these I like. Silverton has it's own style of gameplay and economic system. I really enjoy how the dice are used as a factor in production and economy. Everything just "feels" right.

This has to be my favorite rails/train game.  I really like how it feels closer to a simulation than a game.   One thing I dislike about some other train games is that goods are abstracted.  I don't want to be shipping red cubes to a red city.  In this game you actually transport gold, silver, coal, etc..., and there is a nifty economic market where the prices of the various goods fluctuate based partially upon how much of that good was just sold.  

Part of my rating might also be based on the fact that I live in the region depicted on the game's map.  I've been to Silverton.  While their primary exports may at one time have been gold and silver, in this day and age, I believe the town's primary export is crystalized methamphetamine.

The game can also be played solo, and it is fairly fun playing it so.

This game isn't as complex as it looks at first, though I suggest playing it for the first time with experienced players.  More luck than some like, but that doesn't bother me.  You constantly find yourself changing tactics depending on which cards come up; more tactics than strategy I think.  Overall quite fun but it drags with six players, and when we played only five mines South of Santa Fe came up the whole game.

Middle weight railway / business game where players survey and build railway line, while simultaneously claiming and working mines and passenger routes.  It's rather heavy on the mental calculations - finances, running the trains (advanced rules), and the commodity charts, but it hangs together very well.  The game imparts the feel or running a mining railway in the earlies - dealing with commodity markets, snow, and even the odd event card the turns up at precisely the wrong time.  Great game - especially for essentially a home grown effort.  The shorter scenarios tend to be a little luck based, but the campaign games are very enjoyable (but long).

This game has compelled me to do some more research on those little Colorado and New Mexico towns that you see on the map so that I can understand the railroad history of the area better.

My favorite solitaire game so far (as of Jun 09). This isn't as much a create-a-network game as it is a pure economic game. Buying mines and lumber mills, then paying operating costs, with the possibility of getting nothing out of your investment, plus the costs of getting TO the mine to be able to ship the goods only to see the market price plummet before you get there... it's wonderful.

I like how simple and approachable the rules are.  The game flows very naturally.  Playing the game has a real sense of operating a railroad business.  So far I've only played this game solitaire.

1-6pp; the game that got us into the gaming hobby to begin with.  takes a long time to play, but we love it - it's one of the few games with dice where that mechanic actually works with the theme (how much a mine will pay out has a bit of chance).

RATING: 7.5
A fun railroad game. This game can be very frustrating if you keep depleting mines quickly. The 1st 2 games I have played the player who started in El Paso had unchallenged access to the Copper market which was high the entire game and was a huge advantage. I don't know if this is common or not. 

I usually play with 2 Surveyors regardless of how many people are playing to speed up the game. Surveyor +1/+2 is not nearly as powerfull or used as often as Prospector +1/+2. I am wondering if the Surveyor bonus should also be used for the building second consecutive track roll.

To make the game less "fiddly" I use pink Risk cubes for the goods and a red chip to mark depleted mines. I printed off TGov's awesome map and cut into a puzzle board.

Silverton is a game for a lazy Sunday afternoon. There is some competition for passenger contracts and mines, but it's clearly more of an experiential game, a clunky behemoth that lumbers along at its own, old-school pace. 

With a table of competitive gamers the game will only be marginally useful. The market changes and especially the mine production and depletion influence the results in such a way that even the best-laid plans can fail horribly.

As a laid-back pastime, however, this simulation is quite a lovely affair, and I'm struggling a bit with translating that into a rating.

Great game! Really! I didn't think I was going to like this game by the looks of it. It's a bit bland looking, but boy, the playability is great. There's lots of decisions to make in this game which can really change your outcome. There's a bit of luck in rolling dice. There's a bit of luck in the turn of cards. However, the decisions you make prospecting claims, surveying and laying tracks, and picking passenger routes etc., can really be fun. Silverton rocks for an old train game, it really does.

A fun experience game that, throughout it's play time, builds a nice narrative arc.  Where else can you send a surveyor out to grab a claim for lumber, and it be depleted before you mine it.  Did this guy not notice the claim was absent of trees??  There is luck here, but it favorably adds to the flavor. Mix in the Stock Market elements, the route building, and freight shipping, and you have yourself a great train game.

[Original comment] I have played (as of 12-31-2004) one solitaire game of Silverton, and found it to meet or exceed my expectations. I love the theme of railroading in the Rocky Mountain region. The economics mechanic is excellent, reflecting price changes due to supply-and-demand, time, and some random (die roll) factors - very realistic. It is an excellent solitaire game, and I hope to try it with 5 players, which should be much more demanding.

(December 2006) I have played two 2-player games in the past two weeks, with citizen k. It is different from a solitaire game, and I've enjoyed it. citizen k suggested some modifications that have worked very well, such as open auctions to resolve disputes over track surveys and claims. I think a game with 3 or 4 players would be even more different from solitaire, and I hope to be able to try one someday.

This game is definitely a "keeper" for me. Unfortunately, it takes too long to play and is too complicated to interest my family group. I do look forward to any opportunity to play it with anyone interested.

Update March 2008 - Several months ago, I was fortunate to play two 3-player games, and it was excellent for that number. If the game didn't take so long to play, I probably would play it more often.

May 2009 -- I look forward to playing Silverton again, and am hoping to teach my son-in-law and grandson how to play it one of these days. I might even play it solitaire again, just because it is a good 1-player game.

There are some elements of this game that I like, and I like the idea of investing in mines, building routes and selling goods when the market is in your favor.  All the same, the game was a little too 'mathy' for me.  The board is really hard to read and it's just too small to place cubes let alone find the cities that you are trying to connect to.  I didn't dislike the game, but I am not sure how motivated I am to play it again.

Silverton's a rather long game that simulates the close relationships between mines and railroad companies in the old American West.  But if the last sentence strikes fear in your heart, you don't need to flee in horror.  As far as the rules go, it's streamlined and not very complex at all.  Keeping track of the market prices is a chore, but the Excel program here on the 'Geek will do all the legwork for you.  I have some reservations about the dice in this game because there can be huge, huge swings in your fortunes based on a single die roll.  Your prized gold mine can become depleted before it produces anything, or it can produce a bounty of gold.  You can also lose out on staking an important claim if an opponent challenges you and then rolls higher.  If all of this luck evens out, you have a great game on your hands.  If you take on a few losing propositions early, you may be out of the game - a tough pill to swallow in a game of this length.  Depsite the capriciousness of the dice, I like the game.  Recommended to anyone who isn't turned off by the length, the low level of player interaction, or the boom-bust nature of the dice.

Four plays. Engrossing and superbly atmospheric train game, though some might find it a little weak in the player interaction department. The big downside is that the constant movement of money back and forth slows down the pace; someone really ought to make a play-by-web version of this one. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Long and subject to wild swings of luck, this one falls just on the edge of being worth the experience -- if the theme is attractive, then it is worth a play, as you certainly do feel like you are laying track and prospecting in the Rocky Mountains. If the players aren't cut-throat this can easily turn into a mutual solitaire race for cash. A lot of process each turn with the market adjustment die rolls, the turning of cards, counting of cash and making change, etc. Also entertaining as a purely solitaire game which might be the best way to play. The advanced rules would seem to dial the complexity from "fiddly" to "ludicrous." The game's roots as an enthusiast's life's work are evident. The components of the Mayfair edition are kind of hit-and-miss. The board could stand to be larger. Would make for a pretty decent computer game.

If you love Silverton, you may also like Dwarven Rails. It has a faster, more streamlined experience, without losing the interest:
• Instead of rolling once per mine, there is just one roll per player per turn.
• Every mine costs 2 to buy, 1 to operate.
• Every piece of track costs 2 or 3, depending on terrain.
• The map is modular, and so different every time.
• All markets adjust as a result of a single die roll.

This is a classic train game, as players establish routes from one of several start cities in Colorado. It's an intense game of being the first to grab key routes, as well as acquiring hopefully profitable mines and key major lines. The economics is a brutally simple 2D dice rolling to determine commodity prices, as well as productivity of players' mines. However, all this dice rolling does take time, which supposedly can be sped up with some computer moderator.

I wasn't too keen on all the randomness and reliance on dice to make the game work, but it seems to work well. Prices fluctuate reasonably well, with the once in awhile extreme outlier event. I could not help but compare this with Rails of New England, where the mines are replaced with businesses. The novelty is how the income of the various businesses fluctuate is based on a more sophisticated, and forecastable economic mechanic, lessening the random effects. Because of this, I was calling it the new "Silverton". However, the new game seems to have run into rules issues and is not getting the traction as initially thought. Well, I'd be up to trying this again. For now, it is a '7'.

I think this game is ok, but it's long and lucky, two things which don't mix for me.  I played once as Denver is a 4 player game and felt I had a chance.  I played another time as SLC and I had no chance at all.  3.5 hours is a long time to be stuck in a game with no chance at all.

RATING: 7
A read of the rules makes this game seem completely random in many different ways, but as you begin playing, the things that seemed so strange sort of fade into the background.  It gives a feeling of building up an empire in a way that is reminiscent of a crayon rail, but it's much more complex and you don't spend your time traveling all over the map. A lot of it is about risk insofar as you must decide whether you want to sell now or wait and risk the prices going down, but that's not the most compelling part of the game. The most compelling part is probably staking claims, hoping to see if they will work out and trying to make sure you have enough money to do everything you want to do (the time I played it, I did). The game flows much more smoothly when all players take parts of their turns at once, eliminating downtime.  This means you won't be making deals, but we weren't anyway.

Many years ago my group played this game quite a bit (the old edition with the black-and-white map). The first few games we loved it, but after the fourth or fifth game it became clear that there was one specific route that was clearly better than all the others. (To Leadville, I think, but I don't remember the details.)  It's not that the player who got that route would <i>always</i> win, since there was luck in the dice and the cards -- but it was enough of an advantage that it was foolish to try for anything else.  From then on, every game was just a race for that one route, at which point it became boring.  Maybe this is fixable, but as written, the game is broken.

RATING: 6
As an avid train-gamer, I want to like this game more than I do. This is the game that most people imagine when you say "train game". People that have not been exposed to Age of Steam and 18xx titles that is. It is old school in both the good ways and the bad. It plays like a game designed in the early 80's, but was actually published 10 years later. I suspect the game was in development for that long.

The best thing about the game? You really get the sense of your train company starting out with nothing but cash and growing into a profitable company with tendrils from Utah to New Mexico. You purchase and operate mines until they dry up. You purchase passenger contracts along your lines for regular income. You build track to support the shipment of goods and passengers. The fluctuating markets give you opportunities to ship goods or not depending on how values are holding on a given turn. Nice details, such as the winter months closing about half of the tracks and snow plows you can hire to clear them. There are engines of different sizes to purchase to ship your goods. All of this sounds great, right?

Unfortunately, there many old school "problems" with the game as well. More than one player wants a certain connection, claim or passenger contract? High roll takes it! While early in the game turns can move pretty efficiently, by the time you have a number of claims that all need to operate, a number of passengers that all need to be transported, goods at multiple claims that need to get shipped, trains where you need to CALCULATE how many goods they can carry and decide where you should use them (and don't forget - the number of goods they carry depends on the longest piece of track on their route - so their capacity is potentially different for EVERY SINGLE MINE you own...), new goods valuations at EVERY destination EVERY turn means you need to review your options afresh...  The turns take a long, long time. While the decisions you are making are not uninteresting, they are devoid of tension. Anything that could potentially provide tension is relieved by a dice roll, so very little is actually at stake. The game is so long and meandering, no one decision holds that much weight anyway. This is a long hike, not a sprint. Not even a jog.

The game ending is entirely arbitrary. You can play to a set number of turns, or until someone has a certain amount of money, or until the clock says it is time for everyone to go home. In that sense, the game can be ANY length, but you probably want to play for at least 3 hours so that operations and expansion have time to develop. 

At least you'll never go hungry playing this game. There is plenty of time for a sandwich run while other players are taking their turns.

Only solitaire play of basic and advanced game so far. I was surprised how fast this went. It only took me about 90 minutes play time to finish the $6,000 solitaire scenario. I expected a longer and fiddlier experience after reading up on it on BGG. The only mild hassle was rolling the dice for the market changes. Compared to Agricola's refill phase that's bearable. Even with the advanced rules things didn't get too complicated in solitaire play. The game reminds of Merchant of Venus which isn't too surprising as there are not too many American design school pick-up and deliver games from the late 80's/early 90's. Worth taking a look if you like MoV. Hopefully, I can get some people to give multiplayer Silverton a shot.

Yes, bad luck will doom you in this game. So what; embrace the theme and the experience of playing and it should be fun, win or lose. It is clear that the designer had a passion for western railroading and the related prospecting in this area. I feel like this game tells a story and I love watching it unfold. Accounting on the market prices is not as labor intensive as some others claim. This is a rich game and I don't have a problem putting in the time to play, but I don't think I'd want to play it with more than 3 as the downtime may become severe.

Owning the 1st edition of this game has raised my appreciation a great deal for the game.  I especially like the unexpanded map for solitaire.  But my copy does include the New Mexico expansion - and I can see where with several players that might be a welcomed addition to the game space.

For me, the Mayfair edition  was just too cramped.  The Two Wolf edition is drab looking, but there is room to play the game.  I have printed out the alternate claim/train cards by Darrell H.  I also made a couple of cards to allow me to use the original cards from the base game.

Now that I have played with the advanced rules I cannot ever see going back to the basic game.  It adds a nice logistical element to the game, albeit one that require the players to do some division.

Though this game lacks the nice big board and beautiful components of Railroad Tycoon, in terms of gameplay I enjoyed it more.  Some might find the supply and demand mechanic a bit fiddly (7-8 die rolls each turn), but it adds a little tension and color to the game as players jostle to deliver loads before prices are depressed by big shipments.  The prospecting, operations, and track-building rules work well.  I'd advice playing the "standard" game and with four players or more to enhance the interaction and conflict.  All in all, a great train game.

I own both the original Two Wolf version as well as the Mayfair version.  Each has it's pluses and minuses.  The overall idea being to operate and own not only the railroad lines that link various mines, but also the mines themselves.  Operate the mines to produce more ore, and then ship that ore off to the markets.  Each market has a different demand for each of the ores.

Haven't played yet.  Every time I look at it my eyes hurt.  Why did they make such a small board?  I can't imagine staring at that for the few hours this game takes to play...  Hopefully we'll get an enlargement of the map sometime.

This is an interesting game of railroad development and market management.  The game allows for different strategies and offers many tense decisions.  Ultimately, however, the game might be a little bit too much work for a result that is very susceptible to being determined by a few lucky/unlucky dice rolls on the claim operations.  This is my preliminary feeling after one play of the short (still more than 3 hours) game version.

While 18xx and Age of Steam are my favorite railroad games, Silverton  isn't far behind.  Part of this is that I live in New Mexico, so the history and many of the locations/routes are familiar to me.  It's a good business/railroad sim.  Can run very long with 2 players, but is fun.

My rating is for the solo version of this game. From reading the rules, I believe I would hate this game with multiple players (rolling to figure out who gets a claim?). As a solo game, it's swingy, it's roll-to-see-what happens, but it's pretty fun, and you really end up poring over the map trying to maximize profits before the winter month.

A very luck driven train game. Long term strategies can be developed that can help counteract a bit of the luck, but you never know when nearby mines will come up, and the passenger routes suffer from the same "randomness...though there at least less of those. The game also has very little player interaction, and has a very sllloooww plodding pace.

Losing a mine that's supposed to have a long pay out much earlier than you expected is kind of a downer but overall I enjoyed the path this game layed out.

You can get hit by the dice every now and then which can really make it tough on you or I would have rated it a little higher

Well, I've applied plenty of stickers in my time, but this game takes the prize for having the most confusing and cheapest set of stickers I have ever seen! I accidentally applied stickers to both sides of the pieces, and some wouldn't even come off the paper! So I wrote the company a letter and they said they would replace for $4. 

Hope you have better luck then I did...

This is probably the least "accepted" game I give a 10 to, and I do not have a terribly solid reason for liking it so much.  I know I tend to like economic games.  A healthy dose of luck is introduced with the mine production/depletion, and I like the unreliability. There is also plenty of room for player negotiations and light backstabs.  

The only thing that didn't really grab me was the price-setting engine.  Certain commodities are too powerful at specific points in the game, which allowed scarcity to further tip the game balance due to luck.  Even the provided variant didn't thrill me.  My goal for this game would be to find a better way to model market adjustments.

With a few tweaks, this game is excellent for solo play.

I read good reviews on this and I love trains and games so thought I should get it. I did, but I'm not in love with it. Perhaps too much expectations? I do like the completeness of the game - building sections, mining claims, luck factor, competition, trains and snow - yet for some reason it still doesn't do it. 

I supposed it's because it tries to be so true and complicated that a) it takes too long to play, and b) it doesn't have as much direct interaction as you might expect.

Good economic game. I enjoyed my first play a lot. Feels a slight bit like the gamers version of Empire builder games with fixed routes and a lot more mechanics. There is a certain luck factor (rolling dice to see how much stuff you get out of mines, and these mines can get depleted in the second turn!)

Not a game for casual eurogamers, thanks to the (to me very acceptable) luckfactor of the dice and long gameplay. Even the "short" game took us a little more than 2,5 hours with 2 players(which still is supposedly fast)

Would probably be fun to see how the board get's more crowded with more players, but then the downtime would probably increase as well. Still, curious to see how it plays with 3 (or maybe even 4, but no more)

[u]21-Feb-2016[/u]:  Silverton takes place in the southwest USA. It is a combination route building and stock market game where the player must make connections between cities and towns to deliver goods and passengers in the hopes of making money.  The more the better.  But there is a fluctuating market for the various goods being sold, most of which is affected by random die rolls but also partly because of how much you sell in a given turn.  The player must deal with this ever changing landscape of market prices to make the most money possible within the timeframe of the chosen scenario.

The game can be played in various lengths:  short, medium, or long.  And the long campaign is definitely that...long, several hours so.  But while they all have the same basic concept (make a profit), the differences between the types of scenarios can be quite enjoyable.  You may have to focus on Passenger routes more in one than the other.  A steady supply of Coal might be good for one but not the other.  Hitting up those high priced Silver and Copper mines as soon as possible might be good for all scenarios but especially so in the shorter ones.

There is a lot of die rolling in this game.  A lot.  I use eight dice of four different colors to help speed up the process as you'll need to roll for each of the different goods/market combos at the end of every game turn.  Plus, you'll need to roll for every Claim you want to produce that turn as well.  Throughout the game, the player will purchase Claims of varying good types in the hopes they will produce a large quantity of product, which he will later sell for profit.  To do so, there must be a train route connecting the Claim to one of the main market cities (Denver, Pueblo, etc).  So not only is the player looking to maximize the fluctuating market by purchasing Claims and producing goods to sell, he must also be sure to make a rail system that will work within those choices.

Silverton has quite a thematic feel to it as you build up your rail system based on the Claims in your possession.  The price of goods will fluctuate as you look to sell the right goods at the right moment.  Weather comes in to play as well for every fourth turn is winter.  This will cause some connections to be unusable because of being snow covered.  There is a lot of planning (and math!) involved in this game.  And it is quite enjoyable.

For almost as long as I've been in the hobby, I've been interested in finding a train game that would fit into my solitaire-centric collection, and I'm pleased that Silverton is that game.

I love the dicing in the mines!  The map is a little too small and hard to read but there are redesigns available.  I just need some poker chips and a bigger map to be totally satisfied.  Great flavor.  Personally, I enjoy the dice rolls to change the market at the end of each turn (I mean, I understand why this would bore some people but both my wife and I enjoy this aspect of the game).  This is just one of those games that has 'it' for my personal taste.

Silverton, the game of Colorado railroading! While the intricate board and rules initially seem complex, once you get playing, they begin making sense. Particularly enjoyable is the elegant market mechanism, utilizing supply & demand to drive the prices for coal, silver, gold, and lumber that you must supply to the towns. 3 hours will only get through something like 10 rounds, which is not nearly enough time, especially with many players. Like Monopoly, and not in a good way*, there’s significant luck involved in getting the properties, (railroad lines & mines,) you need to earn money to progress in the game. In this case the randomness of dice rolling is replaced with card drawing. Thankfully, Silverton mitigates this luck factor; as the game goes on, each player will inevitably begin scoring railroads and mines which they are situated to take advantage of. However, this does take time and the game is supposed to be played with 24 rounds, (6 in-game years!) and is even suggested to play till 30 rounds! 9 hours is expected to be able to play a full and fair game. Despite this, the game is enjoyable, perhaps because you don’t really seem to realize how badly you are losing as much as in Monopoly. 

This is a great game that I can’t wait to try again. Incidentally, there is an updated version of the game with fancier graphics, which actually fail miserably at making the game easier to understand and even fundamentally break the originally brilliant market mechanics. So while the original is hard to find, rather bland to look at, and difficult to initially comprehend, it nevertheless must be the version I recommend.

*IS there a good way to be like Monopoly?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.75
I can best summarize this as "like Monopoly, but fun and with trains... and a LOT longer."  This is a railroading expansionism game in the Rockies in the 1800's, which is eerily accurate to historical realities at the time... but rather than just mindless expansion a la Ticket to Ride, this game forces you to purchase claims to lumber yards, gold mines, and so forth - all the while paying to operate them and then needing to use a combination of your and and your opponents' rails and your trains to move goods to the major cities for sale... and the price of goods fluctuates over time and based on number of goods sold per turn.

A fantastic game, one which also offers different lengths of playtime - the full game taking something like 12 hours to do, based on a couple of iterations Jason and I slogged  through.

Silverton is definitely a game of its time with some charming though occasionally clunky gameplay. The randomness inherent in the design will certainly be off-putting to some, but it does provide a thematic experience for those willing to take the trip.

RATING: 8
HIGHLY THEMATIC!!!!  If you can stand a long game with element of luck and a fair amount of down time between turns, give Silverton a shot.  In spite of all the negative things just listed, this game is a  super good game and one of the best train games i have played to date.  There is a high amount of luck in this game, but if you understand your odds and make wise choices (and wiser risks), the various mechanics of luck will really begin to fit the theme (particularly elements of prospecting and predicting market change).

Probably best with 3 or 4 players as you get to play with multiple surveyors and prospectors.  This could also be applied to a 5 or 6 player game as well.

If you have access to a laptop, put it on the game table with and turn up the awesome excel spreadsheet available here at the geek that calculates market change and tracks turn order.  This makes the 9 hr campaign game playable in about 7 or so.

Complaints:  the board is a bit small.  many of the town names are just plain hard to see...stuff also gets covered up by blocks, but whatever.

I might not give it the highest numerical rating, as it does seem to drag at times...the mechanics are pretty straight forward...and sometimes the board is causes a bit too much eye strain.

Nevertheless, this game is awesome.

An outstanding, highly atmospheric railroad/mining game. Discovering and developing mines and lumber camps, figuring out how to get these commodities to market for the best prices, contending with freight limitations, rival prospectors, snow in the high mountains: all really good stuff. The game might bog down with more than three players (there definitely would be a table space problem!). I find the solitaire scenarios to be a lot of fun. Fabulous play money in the Mayfair version.

I've only played the old version.  The cards and map are fairly primitive, but the game itself is not bad.  There is a lot of accounting and I felt like I was running a real balance sheet (I needed to write everything down on scratch paper).  I hear the new version is not as good as the old one.  I'm not sure this is a great game, but it did make me somewhat interested in rail games, an area I haven't explored much.

An odd duck of the railroad game genre with the rail building of Empire Builder/Age of Steam and a market system reminiscent of Wealth of Nations and Tinner's Trail. I can see why plenty of people moan about using the dice in such a manner, but I love Tinner's Trail partly for that reason so it doesn't bother me at all. I really look forward to trying this with advanced rules.

Only current complaints are Mayfair's lackluster board design and the rulebook which is quite vague in some spots.

Call me old fashioned.  Call me an Ameritrasher (but then look at my ratings).  There is a real appeal about this older game, from its' do-it-yourself stickers to the flat puzzle piece board to the "you could have printed them yourself" rules.  Every play has felt like a story being played out.

If you spruced up the map, printed flashier cards, and tweaked the claim card structure, I'm betting this would give Steam a run for its' money.

Finally, a game with a real market.  You glut the coal market in Denver and watch the price plummet.  Leave it alone for a while, and it might go back up (just can't control the weather, can we - deal with it!).  Sometimes you postpone a delivery and the market still drops - hey, it almost acts like the real thing!

Notice, too, that this game has, by what some call it, randomness.  I see it as this game allows you to create opportunities.  The only random thing I would think to adjust is the way claim cards are revealed.  It is possible to only see claims that are so far removed, that there is no way to build your railway there in time to reap any benefits.  However, in a multiplayer game, trading would mitigate this effect.  So I have a hard time wanting to make a wholesale change - maybe just for the solitaire version.

I have not seen many games that fundamentally incorporate risk taking successfully.  This one does, IMO.  You have a chance at a gold claim that has a 50% chance of producing.  You eyeball the gold market, calculate the cost of building track, and try to make a rational decision while ignoring the cash register sounds going off in your head.  BTW, in order to win, you're going to have to invest in claims at some point.  Do you go with that 50% chance of winning everything or with the 88% chance of a successful and steady coal claim?

If you can get over the old-fashioned (1991) game elements, including a board that needs a magnifying glass for us more experienced gamers (ok, old farts), this is a great game!

Why this is not a 10:
-> It is a brain burner - I need a break from it
-> The randomness of claims could be a bummer if you play people who won't negotiate
-> Due to the length and complexity, I could see myself turning it down in favor of something else

Why I rated it an 8 even though I would turn it down:
-> This is a great solitaire game.  I don't feel like I'm playing a system - I'm playing a snippet of life with a really decent chance of succeeding.
-> This game does not abstract some key economic decisions.  It presents a market that can be influenced but not controlled.  It provides great risk/reward decisions.

RATING: 8
Silverton is a good railroad game with an intriguing economic engine. It is random to some extent but the whole idea is to either take risks by operating claims or to take the safer and less productive route of passenger traffic. The components of the Mayfair Games edition are terrible. I was not looking for high quality but was still disappointed. The map is so small that it is a pain in the ass to read and use.  I fixed this problem by downloading a better map from this site. Now that is a good map! Freight is represented by small plastic discs that carry tiny stickers. These are not nice to handle and I wonder whether I should replace them with wooden cubes or something. Now where can I get wooden cubes? Otherwise I have no complaints about the quality as the cards are fine. My rating is based on single playing of the shorter Denver scenario. In other words Silverton plays very well with just one player. Now I should play this with my friends.

"Long route-building game with RotW-style pickup-and-deliver (but better). Lots to love about the game, but it's at least twice as long as it should be."

What I like:
- Lots of historical/thematic accuracy
- I love developing mine AND building the railroad
- Plays quite smoothly, with pretty simple rules

What I don't like:
- Would be a great 1-2 hour game. 2-8 hours is too long.
- The official starting positions force lots of contention
- The town names on the map are really hard to read
- Physically quite fiddly (cubes, goods chips)

Someone should definitely create a streamlined version of this game. Crayon rails would be the perfect physical mechanism (eliminating the surveyors), and the game length should be 1-2 hours even with 4 players. 

I would put the weight around 2.5, far lower than the BGG-voted weight. I guess with trains and plows, the advanced game might get up to about 2.9.

I'm not a big fan of train games but I did enjoy this one. What separates this one is the volatility of the market. Unlike other rail games, you really don't know what the value of your shipment is until you deliver it. This adds a tension to the game that I have not seen in other rail games.

I got the original Two Wolf version of this game at a game convention many years ago when I was vacationing in San Diego. I met the designer and his wife who were both very nice and patiently explained the game to me before I bought it, so I bought a Silverton coffee cup as well. Sadly, I understand he passed away not long after that convention and I think of him whenever I use that coffee cup to pull chits.

This is a very enjoyable and challenging game to play solo. I love the fact that it has a commodities market that can be affected by the number of goods sold that turn. The advanced rules even add more challenges as you can only deliver a certain number of goods based on your trains power and the distance you have to travel. This is probably one of my favorite games right now. I can't wait to play this with some friends.

A three-hour game with lots of dice-luck doesn't sound like a good combination, but this game pulls it off very well.  This is a strongly-themed pick-up-and-deliver game where you're trying to harvest/mine various goods and sell them at several hub cities, where the price of the goods fluctuates.  Players buy claims to production spots, and then have to build rail out to that spot to actually collect it.  However, the claims produce based on a die roll (and some claims have more favorable odds than others), and on a bad die roll the claim could run out... forever!  There is a significant amount of administrative overhead in this game, and downtime can be an issue.  However, if you're into deep, involved pick-up-and-deliver games and don't mind some randomness, definitely check this out.

I'm more into wargames than Euros, but maybe this is a wargamer's train game. A bit of theme to it, some randomness and die rolling, big and slow. As a bonus, it's mathy. Solitaire, I kind of like playing it wargamer style (playing several roles) rather than the solo scenarios, as the game is more interesting when it's big and long.

While in theory the dice have an equal chance of rolling high as they do low, this game penalizes those who have a streak of low die rolls. Suggested house rule is to reverse the gold roll range.

This is an investment of a lot of time for potentially a streaky and random result - which leads to sessions which are not satisfyingly entertaining.

Works well as a 3 or 4 player version
For 3 player use the nickel spike where each starts in Denver and one of Santa Fe, El Paso, Salt Lake City. 
For 4 player use Silver spike where all start out of Denver and 2 players each start in Salt Lake City and El Paso
 
Block out the time for a campaign game but use a variable end - so the game ends somewhere in the last 6 or so turns, but so you don't know exactly when. Could use a die roll first time 1 ends game, second 1 or 2 ends game....

Not as sold on the advanced game, the route calculation requirements add to what is already a long game. Not convinced that it adds much more to the 2 delivery turn restriction on the basic game.

Silverton is "THE" train game. Yes the print on the board is a little bit too small and all of those stickers on the chips but trust me, this is the train game of them all. I only hope that Mayfair will do a upgrade on this game soon like they are with the crayon train games. On my top 10 list

Thought this game was absolutely outstanding on my first play.  A good mix of rail-building and commodity speculation, with a nice effort at a fully-functional economic system.  Introduces a welcome element of luck and "which-goods-do-I-trade" choice into the train genre.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Fun game.  Takes some book keeping and quite a bit of 2d6 dice rolling to maintain market values over five citys, but is enjoyable.  I recommend keeping a calculator handy.  The advanced rules add quite a bit more depth like trains that can only haul so much weight and double and triple engines on a train to make it over difficult passes.  This gives a very analytical strategy level that is challenging to apply to victory.  

It is by far heavier than Ticket to Ride and Empire Builder but probably not as heavy as Age of Steam or Steam and it certainly is different than all of those I've played but is very playable and fun!  You really are much more of a business man in this and making deals with other players really adds a level even when using the basic rules only.

The game is slower when calculating loads and clearing track of snow, so like all games you need to have the right group; however, the only thing that I would quickly change is the size of the board.  Making it larger would make it much more readable to a group session.  The current size of the board is fine for solo play.

Solo play by-the-way is quite difficult to control your success because you need to really play your odds into a very trim economical window of time.  Some solo plays may be impossible to win.

RATING: 8
Build track, work mines, deliver goods to market. A volatile market and the difficulties of operating in the Rockies in Winter make a very interesting, but very long, game. This fits in nicely with other rail/economic development/delivery games such as Brass, Railroad Tycoon, and the crayon rail games. Also good for history fans, because the game is very true to the region and the times.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Ah... I'd nearly forgotten all about this little gem. A different approach on the normal 'rail' theme. You need to go surveying for mines, and build rail to service them, and then run loads into the markets. Market prices fluxuate on their own, and massive deliveries will depress prices, so there's quite a bit going on, in a very nicely done historical context.

I love the mechanics of this game.  It feels like it should be an awesome game.  However, the balance seems to wreck it.  This may be because as "crayon rail" fans we minimize player interaction instead of emphasizing seemingly important deal-making tactics.

Our games always end up as a race to Leadville: whoever gets there first inevitably wins due to the high payouts for the passenger routes.  Leadville seems totally broken, are we playing incorrectly or something?

A train game that can be played solitaire!  And a fun one at that!  I very much look forward to introducing this one to my game group.

(There are dice.  If you can't deal with luck, you may not like this game - or you may just want to use the auction variant described in the forums.  Me, I prefer dice to auctions - but then, I prefer most things to auctions.  :-))

This is in that special category of my all-time favorites. The game is dripping with New Mexico, Colorado and Utah historical accuracy. My grandfather was a published author of New Mexico history, so I tend to be overly critical of western themed games, but this one is great.

Gameplay is very well balanced and the theme is definitely not pasted on (I tend to be overly critical about that as well). However, you definitely need to play with the auctioning variant; it really makes the game more complete.

----------

This is a good experiential game, but I could never consider it competitive at all because luck simply plays FAR too large a role in the game; a streak of bad rolls WILL ruin the game for someone.  I'm not a big fan of long games where luck can cripple your position.

Furthermore, I think the game would be better with more players, as I've only played it with 2.  

I actually really enjoy the solo gameplay, much to my surprise.  Pretty deep and rewarding experience.

[b]What's the solitaire game about?[/b]
Making money. You do this by buying claims to likely mining and lumber deposits, building track between your market and the claims, operating the claims, and freighting the products from such claims to market via your trains.

[b]What are the victory conditions for the solitaire game?[/b]
:d6-1: To make a certain amount of money as quickly as possible. The turn you achieve this financial goal determines your level of victory (or loss). Three scenarios use this goal, I've played two of them three times.
:d6-2: To make as much money as possible in 24 turns. The amount you have determines your level of victory (or loss). Two scenarios use this goal; I've played one. 

[b]What do I enjoy about the game?[/b]
:d6-1: The game play is relatively simple. The rulebook is pretty short and I think, well written. Quite a few paragraphs may be hastily read as they only pertain to the two player game. The advanced or optional rules are easy to learn and implement. They increased my enjoyment of the game.
:d6-2: I really enjoy that the game [b]utilizes chance[/b] to determine so many elements in this game, yet provides the player with means of taking advantage of good luck and hedging against bad luck. I think the designer did well building a system that gives the player an impression that they are one player in a business environment that is constantly changing based off the inputs of the market and competitors. Even in the solitaire game I feel like the random availability of new claims and the fluctuation of market prices is due to actions taken by other players and the market at large. The cards and die rolling aren't there solely to provide a mechanism for the sake of resolving the game, they do so while making me feel they are an honest attempt to simulate and describe the wider environment.
:d6-3: [b]Planning[/b] your effort to acquire claims and build track forces me to think at least several turns in advance while accepting that a random event or downswing in market prices may seriously alter those plans. The player cannot just play for the present, your actions must work toward a larger goal in the future in order to succeed.
:d6-4: Silverton manages to feel [b]incredibly thematic[/b] while it forces the player to [b]constantly do math[/b]. Silverton manages to be both fun and intellectually stimulating (for me).
:d6-5: I love managing my train fleet while figuring out how best to shift goods and take advantage of high market prices. You always want to make money, but just because you can sell and make some doesn't mean the timing is the best. What you sell, when you sell it, and how much of it you sell are hefty considerations each turn. You only have a limited ability to transport freight and you want to get it to market when the price is at the highest. Sometimes it makes sense to sell a little bit of silver or coal or lumber even though you have more that you could have sold. Sometimes it makes sense to hold back for a few turns and then slam the market while the prices are high, knowing that you will crash prices for a few turns. Often times some commodities are rising while others are crashing or others are diddling about. Can I crash one market now but be prepared to score big if another low commodity rises quickly over the next couple turns?
:d6-6: I get a [b]"just one more turn"[/b] mentality while playing...well, I did for each of the four games I played. I literally finished the 24 turn campaign a couple hours past midnight...and a few hours later than I intended to quit. I just couldn't walk away. I had to play just one more turn to see if I could scoop up a new promising claim or see if the conditions were right to slam the market with silver or copper and make a huge profit.
:d6-1::d6-1: The solitaire scenarios offer different experiences, even if slightly. Long, medium, and short games are offered. There truly is much more to consider in the long game. The length of play opens up new options not present in the shorter games. Not only do you have time to build track to another market, but you'll need to do so to succeed (based on my experience). But to which one will you build. And how will you manage your operation of old claims and acquisition of new claims and manage your track as you approach the upper limits of track you can operate? 

[b]What did I not enjoy about this game?[/b] Well, these are all relatively minor to me. But perhaps more important to some of you.
:d6-1: [b]The map is small[/b]. Too small. The numbers are squished in and the cubes you use to mark your sections of track obscure too much at times. I don't think it's that big a deal for the solitaire gamer but I think it could impede gameplay with more than one player. There is a much nicer and larger fan made board available in the file section I may try to print one day.
:d6-2: There is a [b]lot of die rolling[/b]. Even for a guy like me. Especially on the campaign scenario when you must account for price changes in each market. It actually gets better as the game moves into the last 20% or so of the available turns. By that time demand is going way up so you can count on prices rising if you didn't sell to a particular market. Annoying from the beginning through much of the game but it slowly improves. There is a digital file or two available on BGG that automates it for you but that only works if you want to play with a computer screen next to your game.
:d6-3: The commodity price chart tracks prices on vertical tracks using wooden cubes. It's really easy to bump it and dislodge cubes. When this happens it is annoying at best but possibly game disruptive at worst.
:d6-4: Sometimes the luck can be a downer when you're all setup to buy a bunch of claims over the next few turns that you've already built track when prices are high and a random event card eliminates those claims and gives you all new claims that are worthless. Kind of a downer, but in fairness you won't find me complaining when it does the opposite and gives me a bunch of perfectly located claims when prices are high.
:d6-5: The paper money included with the game is cool. It gives the game an old school feel. However, it's not good for playing fast. Keep it in the box, make yourself a nice spreadsheet (or download the one I'm about to upload to BGG), and use paper and pencil to track your funds.
:d6-6: I certainly don't mind long games, and this game gives you campaigns of three different lengths to play. But nonetheless, the gameplay can take a while. Especially on the 24 turn campaign. [b]It takes time and a fair bit of tablespace[/b].

[b][u]Summary[/u][/b]
[b]I dig this game.[/b] Choo, choo! It's been a great change of pace for me in a sense. Typically I play wargames or games where one bit of cardboard blows another bit of cardboard up. It shares an element I find I enjoy in wargames. The successful marriage of chance and planning. Trains, track building, plow trains for the winter months, moving shipments of ore, coal, and lumber, speculating (who loves the casino!), making money? Yes please. Way more fun that I anticipated. It looks dry. It looks simple. It has cubes and fairly boring cards. But by gum, it's exciting to play!

[b][u]Comparison[/u][/b]
I've always thought very highly of [thing=17133]Railroad Tycoon[/thing]. I love playing it. It works well with new gamers. It's fast paced (even if long), looks good, and offers cutthroat multiplayer competition. It doesn't feel to historical to me, though. No solitaire (boo!).

Silverton is not like Railroad Tycoon. Okay they have trains, you build track, and move goods to market. Yeah, I've only played one multiplayer (can't solo it, I wouldn't think) and only played the other solitaire. I think Silverton would offer cutthroat multiplayer competition, mayhaps even more so than Railroad Tycoon. But while the rules are still simple, it's a bit more meaty and deapthy than RT. It's also not as attractive physically; though it is more attractive to the solitaire mind. Love isn't about looks, is it?

Just a strange and brief comparison in case anyone is interested.

[b]Who do I think might enjoy this game?[/b]
-Thinky players.
-Planners.
-Moneymen.
-Empire builders.
-Speculators.
-People at peace with the roles Lady Luck and Dame Fortune play in our lives.
-Those with an interest in trains, economics, history, the American West.
-Transportation junkies.

[b]Who should avoid speculating on this game?[/b]
-Those interested in quick games.
-Omnipotent control freaks (anti-die rollers, chance haters).
-Gamers who like "bling". This game was produced in early 90s and while I think it's functional and attractive, it will not stand up well cosmetically to newer design standards.
-People who hate trains, money, resource based extraction, the American West, or history.
-Anyone who gets deathly ill around cubes or other wooden implements of gaming.

RATING: 7
Solo Player Value = Fair. While the game is fine solo, it is better with more. More players offer more fighting for routes and delivery cards which in my mind is better for the game as it becomes more competitive. I don't like just playing for points.

Two Player Value = Good. While the game is fine with two players, it is better with more. More players offer more fighting for routes and delivery cards which in my mind is better for the game as it becomes more competitive.

Three Player Value = Good


Silverton is a fairly decent competitive game overall. The game scales very well to fit more players.

Silverton fits the "train" game feeling sufficiently, which is important with a train game. You are left with a feeling of having built track and made deliveries.

Building track is simple and uses pre-existing routes. Players just claim routes to use and limited in how many routes they can claim. 

The deliveries are handled by a cool mechanic of "operating" the cards. This simply means that the player must pay to use the card to generate goods for delivery. This is fun and different mechanic that gives the players more choices as the player can choose which cards use/operate each turn. This also brings in the possibility of cards going empty and no longer producing goods. This is a great new mechanic and forces the player to keep looking for, and buying, new delivery cards.

When deliveries are made the player earns money according to a fluctuating market. The market fluctuates based on how many deliveries of a particular good is delivered. This is a crude yet effective way to force the players into delivering different goods.

The only negatives about the game is a somewhat steep learning curve when learning from the rules and a poor map. The map is written with very small print and is difficult to read for some. 

Pros - 
- Great train game feeling
- Cool mechanics of operating cards and fluctuating goods market
- Scales well

Cons - 
- The rules can be difficult to learn from
- The game can make some players prone to analysis paralysis making the game drag a bit

The amount of luck is excessive for the management and the planning that this game demads, and for its weight. Besides, the map and the starting sites of the players seem very unbalanced, and the mechanics may allow that someone takes advantage for no reason. On top of that lays the very long time that [i]Silverton[/i] takes in order to be played. I know, I know, it is from the old school, but for sure it hasn't grown old well. I can't remember another train game that I've played that I wouldn't play over this one.

There are a lot of things to like about Silverton.  Being a rail game (for me) is of course the first thing.  I like that there are multiple ways to earn money.  I like having passenger lines being an option.  I like that the seasons (i.e. winter) matter in what you are doing.  I really like how the mines work.  The market is something else I really enjoy.  I like that there are a ton of options you can add to your games to make them more interesting.  Unfortunately, I do not get to play this nearly enough.  

There are a couple of problems.  I'm not generally fond of preprinted routes, but they are acceptable in this game.  The rules for allowing access were troublesome everytime I've played.  I'm not confident we got them right at any time.  There are also some significant differences in the starting positions that I think unbalance the game somewhat, as do a number of the mines.  So far, I am willing to forgive this, though, as the game is so enjoyable.  [07/08/2012]

RATING: 7
[1 play] This deserves a 7, because it is still a pretty great game, considering it's age, and how many die rolls against a DRM chart are required. If we hadn't used the macro on Michael's computer, that would have gotten pretty tiresome. Still, despite enjoying playing this old classic, I can't help but feel it could be redesigned and cleaned up into something that moved quicker, and had more meaningful player interaction on and off the map. I think another play might drop it to a 6, and have little hope that it would ever rise above a 7.

Super glad to have given this a try and would enjoy giving it another go, despite my non-rave review above.

Most recent play July '14.

RATING: 7
Good game, though the commodities table is unnecessarily fiddly, and how well the claims do is heavily skewed by luck. Then again, the presence of luck is highly thematic, and does a good job capturing the experience of investing in mines. Probably best with 2-3 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I adore the theme of this game. It is by no means elegant. It lacks the streamlining of many euros and has a fairly strong element of luck in terms of how your mines pan out. The fluctuating market is a fascinating mechanic, but we only play it using the app designed to take care of all the fiddly bits - this makes the game much quicker and more enjoyable.

The game is very long, but if you relish the idea of taking risks, building routes and mining to try and make your fortune, you'll be as enamoured with this one as I am.

RATING: 7.5
This is a nicely paced empire-builder type train game.  Grow you infrastructure as you explore new cities.  Mostly this is a tactical race of efficiency.  See what is available, then take what you can.  With two there isn't an overwhelming amount of interaction, but with more the pace of the game will decrease dramatically.  I think this will be best with three.  With more I think the game would really bog down and while it is good to get up in each other's grill the repercussions of losing turns from bad luck with claim jumping make for a potentially disappointing game.

Still, theme is entrenched here.  Even though luck is high, I like the way it reinforces theme here.

It's a shame that the rules are so convoluted.  This game could be explained in a couple minutes, as opposed to trying to figure out how to even set up the game.

1 play solo (partial game), 1 full game basic rules, 1 LONG (24 turn, 9 hour!!) game. 

It's a very thematic game. I want to like it, but the randomness (while it does go along with the theme of speculating on mine production) is just too annoying. Especially since the game takes SO long! It's also very fiddly, with the constant dice rolling. I will play it again, but with several modifications to the basic rules:
- no dice rolling to settle claim disputes; instead, involved players auction the claim off
- no price chart; instead, use the Excel spreadsheet (my modified version) to track/calculate prices -- works GREAT!
- all players conduct some phases SIMULTANEOUSLY: there's no need for everyone to sit there watching someone operate their mines! 
- may use a dice deck (1 deck per player) for mine operations
- don't play 24 turns! The last 4  turns we were just hoping for good rolls on price changes; they were faster turns, but boring.
- play with 2 or 3 players; possibly 4 if we can all play quickly

I think it will be a nice change of pace, but Age of Steam is WAY better!

I really enjoy rail games such as Rail Baron and British Rails, and Silverton is another good one.  Using the player aid listed here on The Geek is a must to keep the game moving.  For our first game we played the Golden Spike variant with 24 total turns.  Four hours later, we had finished 11 turns.  With the experience, we should now be able to finish a game in that length of time (only by using the spreadsheet aid).  Producing on your claims and watching the commodity prices fluctuate is a blast.  I&#039;m not sure what the best strategy is, but I think you need to produce a good amount of copper, silver, and gold, and you need to generate substantial revenue from the passenger routes.  Definitely worth the time investment.

Bought for solo play. Having read up on the game here, skipped using the chips except for the white ones for snowplows and depletion markers. Use a set of black plastic Risk army counters, with the small units counting as single loads and the big ones as 5-loads.

Cards are good quality and good size for solo play, and should hold up over time easily.

Map is serviceable, not great to look at. Don't have an issue with the commodity price calculation phase as many seem to; I put the commodities I sell on the chart to remind me how many of each I sold that turn and the math is simple really.

Didn't use snowplows and engines first play, which was the Denver $6K game. Played it to a 14-turn draw, and ended with $9,275 after a big payoff on last turn.

Excellent train game that simulates mining in 1800s Colorado.  There is a fair amount of luck to the game but it can be mitigated somewhat by knowing what the odds are on how well a mine will produce.  I don't really mind the luck aspect either as it ties into the theme quite well.  Have played with the advanced rules lately and it is quite a solid game.

Lots of setup when you first get the game, putting stickers onto small poker chips.  Large luck factor depending on where claims open up.  In 3-4 player games the player starting at El Paso has consistently had the advantage since claims in that area have come up disproportionately often in the early stages of the game.  I want to try a five-player game some time but haven't been able to get enough people together.

Fairly simple train game where you build track, set up passenger routes, and pay prospectors to work claims for resources, which you are paid handsomely for transporting. Claims can dry up at any time, which is both realistic and incredibly frustrating. The advanced game makes the transporting of goods both harder and much more interesting by requiring you to also buy and upgrade trains.

I originally heard about Silverton as a solo game and picked it up to try on that basis; it does work quite well -- just not well enough to own just for the solo experience. The reason it works at all is the luck element. Not only do claims produce erratically, the resource market fluctuates on its own. The problem there is that the model is one of increasing demand, where prices are highly likely to increase unless goods of that type are sold -- the result is that, without competition, you can wait until prices peak and be guaranteed maximum profit.

Taking all the fun and teunsion out of market manipulation wouldn't be a game breaker; taking the contention out of route-building is. There are rules around stealing passenger lines by building a more efficient route, which is cute, and there are various cases where there are parallel snowbound routes which you have no reason to take in a single player game. But the real killer is the interaction of route blocking and mine claims. Because claim operation is highly random, it's more efficient to purchase a claim before building a railroad to it, to ensure it produces enough to pay out. With more players, establishing a larger network not only seals off future claim locations for your exclusive use, it's possible to seal claims already being operated by another player, which is where the rules for trading, negotiation, and allowing other players to ship your goods come in.

But if I'm skeptical about playing the game again solo, I'm also skeptical about playing it with a larger group. I think it could be excellent with the right crowd, but it's one I would be hesitant to introduce -- the chance of it falling catastrophically flat is high. The luck factor is significant, it can run hilariously long, there is some tedious bookkeeping to contend with, and it's both very difficult and frequently necessary to see small locations on the board. 

With all that said, I really like the game, and I'm not sure why. It might be that, in an era of elegance, it's a very idiosyncratic design. It's got some almost wargameish rules, clearly included for historical chrome, and the result is a highly, highly thematic game -- want to feel like a rail baron? You've come to the right place.

My love of train games makes my rating here probably higher than it should be, but I really like this game.  Very interesting and lost and losts to think and plan out. In the end though the game is extremely luck dependant for a game that takes too long to play

I really, really like Silverton. Its a very good economic game that plays very smoothly. There is a ton of player interaction, both direct and indirect, with trading and disputes (direct), and with the manipulation of the markets (indirect). It plays very well solo as well. My only issues with the solo game are you can usually tell whether or not you're going to win 2, 3, or 4 turns before the end, and it may be impossible to win due to the luck of what claims and, to a lesser extent, what passenger routes come up.

Still, a very good game that is really not as complex as it may seem at first and is highly thematic.

The dicing for the market prices has its merits, though.

My favourite train game.  It requires you to develop the resources you plan to ship as well as create your routes.  More realistic than Age of Steam (you want efficient routes) and less punishing than 18XX (buying new trains won't bankrupt you).  It does have a strong element of solitaire.

RATING: 8.5
Ugly board, fairly average components, messy market value mechanic, luck of the card draw, reliant upon random dice rolls.
Love it.
It just scratches an itch. They don't make them like this anymore and probably for good reason, but in a sea of rehashed worker placement games and deck builders this little gem shines as bright as the sun. I've only played solo, but when I'm alone with this the rest of the world can just go and take a long walk off a short pier. Magical.

Lots of agonising decisions, and a fair bit of luck.  However, the love that the designer had for his subject matter shines through.  Highly thematic.

Excellent solo-play - why can't more games have variants that work as well as this? Great economic simulation and the Excel spreadsheet is a must.

Looking forward to working my way through the solo variants.

Apologies to the Smiths, but while a fantastic game historically and in terms of detail, not a well designed game from a play-flow point of view. Specifically:
* The market simulation takes too much time. It would be far faster without the random element, and I don't think it would change the game much.
* Activating all mines one by one is equally time-consuming, but more defensible since one shouldn't expect to predict mine exhaustion. However this activation could be made much faster because:
* The individual counters for goods are unneeded and should be replaced with simpler tokens--only ones and fives are needed. If the tokens are on a gold mine, they're gold; if they're on the gold box on the board, they're gold; etc.
* Track and resource buys should be done directly: put the cube down or take the card and pay the money--if a player with actions left objects, then immediately resolve the conflict and move on. (Personally, I would prefer this be resolved by an auction.)
* All money amounts could be divided by five (obviously) and really by ten, given the few times fives come up. Note that most games consider that 2 digit accuracy in scores suffices and Settlers is 1 digit. Four digits is over the top.

Note that while some of these points would need a redesign of the game, some can be implemented with the current game.

While I obviously think the game is implemented poorly, it is fundamentally a good game.

It's a cranky old-fashioned design that demands an entire afternoon.  And it deserves every minute, because it is awesome.  As I've opined elsewhere, 'Silverton' never lags; it is so captivatingly integrated with its steam-era theme, you'll walk away licking coal dust off the corner of your smile. And you won't think anything of the hours you spent earning it.

'Silverton' supports multiple styles of play.  It can be as rough and ornery as you want it to be.  (I tend to like to be.)  But, if you're playing with the missus or with church-going folk, it can clean up as nice and smooth as a fat baby's ass.  My sense is that 'Silverton' shines as a game for 4 players, with a crowded temper-tempting map, and a hint of whiskey on its breath.  

Now some folks are going to whine about the random resource entry into 'Silverton', but personally I reckon since the game involves so many resource-draws, i.e., trials, the random effects are dampened with good long-term planning and diversified acquisitions.

Two plays so far. The Denver solitaire scenario going to $6k and The Golden Spike 2 player scenario with the wife (I lost). It was fun but I think this will shine with 3 or more. With this scenario there's not enough time to use most of the board it seems, I felt somewhat limited throughout the game but still enjoyed it.

After a 3-player (Short) game I can honestly say that this game holds up well. It was very enjoyable and more fun than the Golden Spike 2 player scenario. Money was fairly tight due to competing for lines and the game ended with all of us within $500 of each other.
4 player game seems better than the 3 player game.  The only bad thing is the map is hard to read.

Really fun game with a much too small map!  I understand why the map is the size it is b/c all of the cards and tokens take up a lot of space, but come on you have to get up and hover over the map to see anything!!!

I have done a map redesign that makes it much easier to play IMO.  You can see it in on the games page and download it.

Your standard rail game: long, multi-player solitaire. But the sheer pleasure of blasting a rail through the mountains, racing to ship passengers to Denver and lay claims in Leadville, and riding the vagaries of the market (a process made painless by the Excel Runtime aid available here on the Geek) keeps me well-entertained. I'd rate it higher, but we always run out of time just when things are really getting interesting.

I now have 1 multiplayer game played in addition to 3 solitaire plays (2x Denver $6K, 1x SLC $10K).  Some interesting things going on, particularly with the market which has a combination of random (die roll), supply (amount sold last round), and time (upward pressure on price as the game progresses) influences on prices.  
The solo game is limited, as without competition you can just save up, wait for prices to rise, and then try to get in a few huge sales -- reminds me of solo Agricola in some ways.  So it is interesting to learn the mechanics this way, but I don't feel any need for more solo plays now that I know it.
Multiplayer is fun, but long.  I hope we can do some things to cut down our play time, but even that won't keep me from pushing for more plays.  The tightness of your margins and high operating costs really come through in multiplayer even more, because there are more price crashes due to large loads being delivered.

Strongly random, with lots of extra rules you can add in... for more bonus randomness! yay!  Also has a runaway leader problem, compounded by a length problem; as well as a fiddliness problem compounded by a board that's too small/not adequately graphically designed for the components.

Has a special spot in my gaming heart. Good fun, nice theme, and some interesting mechanics (the depletion of mines, speculation on mines that may never produce, changing prices in the various markets). Downsides: visually very unappealing, passenger routes seem to be not valuable enough (if they were more valuable, they might be a solid strategy in their own?).  My advice: ignore the visuals and give it a try!

Hands down my favorite train game. I really enjoy the random element of the claims, though it does take a few plays to figure out where the profitable ones are located. Perhaps my only minor complaint is that certain starting positions are easier to play than others. However, the game is so intuitive and fun that I hardly notice this. Any fan of train games owes it to himself/herself to play this game, and more than likely pick up a copy!

Silverton is old school; it's those 3 miles in the snow your grandfather claims to have walked every day to get to school when he was young. There's just no reason to put yourself through the trouble of playing this when there are so many modern designs that capture the same basic ideas. Even 18XX, which is byzantine in its own right, offers much more depth with less clutter and a cleaner interface. Even fans of the game admit that it's nostalgia that draws them to it more than anything else. Thankfully I never lived through that era in gaming.

A rail game where you claim passenger routes and deliver goods from mines. There is a large luck element for such a complex game, which determines how much the mines produce and, to a certain extent, the price of the goods. There are multiple ways to play the game, in terms of complexity and length.

Solid, strongly-themed game, but too many little problems for me. It's too long, the roll-off for cards and routes is jarring, the map--both aesthetically and functionally--isn't there, and the luck of mine "shafts" (ha!) is maddening (why not have two or three stages of exhaustion?). Definitely like the market and the components are nice and chunky. But overall, I'd have to be really into the theme to get this working for me, and I'm just not.

It was a great 1970s era economic/mining simulation, but not a good game.  I all, I respect the product the game for what it is, a monument built in the past and passed down.  

Some specific notes:  our 3 hour game seemed to run 4 hours, even with the simple game; little to no player interaction, lots of fiddling to keep the economic simulation going.

Silverton is probably best used as a gateway game for friends who prefer light decisions and don't mind a significant luck factor.  And a fondness for rail games certainly couldn't hurt.

Hard-core gamers will likely balk at the game.  It isn't fun to watch an opponent earn $2000 per turn simply because he has hot dice and an active gold mine.  (I won my last 2-player game of Silverton $10,000 to $375!!)

Strategy?  Invest in precious metals and roll well!

(Trade Interest: low) it was a fun game, though i thought it was a little "random" for a thinking game.  it seemed pretty easy to get screwed by having all your claims dry up on the same turn.  that happened twice to me, yet i still managed to squeak out a win.  i would definitely play again.

A really meaty and satisfying pick up & deliver game.  Although the interaction is limited to the occasional track building and mine/passenger claiming disputes, I don't mind it at all.  The dice rolling for production and market value is a pain, as well as the calculation for the power needed to deliver goods.  However, it's all part of the "fun" right?

I would love to rate Silverton higher but for our four player game, it seems that the map is skewed heavily in favor of the person starting out in El Paso.  Like Salt Lake City the area is left uncontested for the most part but it has additional markets to sell to and more variety in the mine types.  Would have to try it again with less to see if it's more balanced.

I was surprisingly impressed with this game. Having been a fan of other Mayfair rail games (Eurorails, Empirebuilder, etc.) I was expecting this to be more of the same.
This game is however, far superior. By adding a variable market rate, winter, snowplows and raw pulling power of your trains, there are far more variables that need to be controlled and weighed to pull off an epic victory. If you like Mayfair train games, this will be your new favourite. Be warned that it is a bit math heavy for the advanced rules, but a basic calculator nearby will cure all your ails.

An economic dicefest.

People enjoyed it, but there are major problems with this game. The #1 and #2 players were basically evident from the first turn of the game. For the last hour and a bit I knew I was going to win and it was basically about not telegraphing my moves in advance.

The game is very, very luck dependent. This sort of works against what I said before, but a single snake eyes can make the difference between winning and losing if it happens early in the game. Likewise, the commodity system felt a bit too random.

Overall, it's not bad, but for the time required I'd almost always rather play Indonesia to fulfill the need for a heavy economic game.

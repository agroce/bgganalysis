Conquer China and india by Turn 3 with the massive Japanese Air Force. Was this play tested AT ALL!? No play balance, a problem this series has always had IMO.

I have mixed fealings about this game.
On the good side, great effort was made in regard of historical accuracy, combined arms strategies and added facilities (airfields, naval bases and minor industrial complex are great addition to the game).  Special rules for China are also very well thought.
However, the game was rushed to production and efforts were obviously made in attempts to keep production cost to a minimum:
-No IPC: the rules suggest to elect a "banker" which should keep track with a pen and a paper of everyone's money. Yes, seriously.

-Limited figures: some players don't even have enough figures for the initial setup, needing the chip markers.  China needs to use US figures to complete its set (no artillery nor fighter plane although required on the initial setup).

-Lack of in-game help: You need to refer to the rulebook for about any basic information such as order of play, play sequence, unit strength and prices (the battle helper card has errors on it).
Luckily, I found some fan-made solutions to this mess.

-Inefficient "hardware"; The game is also missing tray compartment for the units.  Making the purchase phase more tendentious than it should, searching through the units.  IPC tracker also stops short.  Forcing the US player to use 2 makers right at beginning of the game (how much would it cost to double the size of this tiny board and have it up to 60 ?)
We are talking about a game that sells for 90$!

All these problems were taken care of in the 1984 edition.  Why remove the IPC or compartment trays in a "Deluxe" edition?

EDIT : Reviewed score upgraded to 6.5 after playing with Second Edition rules.

Second edition (along with some nice files found on this very site) fixed many of the shortcomings highlighted above.  Components are now in sufficient numbers and some game-play rules were ironed out.
It is now a very decent game.

My second favorite version of this game, though it is inasnely difficult to finish a full game. First and foremost, the map is HUGE and allows free flowing movement of gameplay and easy vision over the board. There are new units and new opportunities to interrupt supply routes. Also this version includes China and ANZAC (Australian/New Zealand Armed Corps) for the Allies. A bit pricey, but with the excellent board, incredible figures, and the soon-to-come ability to link it with A&A: Europe 1940 map, it is by far my favorite board game.

Although, I love the theme of A&A Europe much better, I like how much more open-ended this game is (read my comments for A&A Europe).  Each time I play this game I never know what the map will look like after turn three.  Definitely the most open-ended of the A&A series.

5/31/13 - Rating Lowered. Comments are specifically aimed at the first edition.

This really isn't playable out of the box.  You should get the additional tac. bombers, from Avalon Hill, the updated combat board, and download the second edition rules which have significant changes, making the game better and more balanced.  If you have the first edition, you don't need to buy the second edition, just make sure you upgrade everything.


9/6/10 - Comments after play
Would be rated higher, but points subtracted due to game being overpriced for what it is.  My recommendation is not to play this without printing out the full page battle board and the National Production Income chart that are in the files section.  Additionally the official errata and FAQ is pretty much mandatory.  I'd also recommend at least looking at the latest incarnation of the alpha rules at the author's site.

Based on game length for playing just the Pacific map I anticipate that the 1940 Global is going to check in at around an 8 hour game minimum.  Don't get me wrong, it's an enjoyable game, but I think that the Anniversary edition is going to continue by far to be the one that gets the most table time.

[/rant on] I think that A&A jumped the shark on this one.  Okay, how do we top the Anniversary edition?  I know, let's make it a little bigger, and charge a lot more.  And because it's going to be so big and good, and and so big, let's split it into 2 boxes and make the customers buy it twice.  Take the 'Kill Bill' approach to game making, and observe the lessons on how to maximize revenue.  I'm sure that the designer had good intent, but then the AH guys got their hands on it and said "How can we make this as cheaply as possible, and how much can we charge and still get all the A&A junkies to buy it".  It feels rushed, and like corners were cut to get it out by Christmas.  The one nice thing is that that the map boards are very well done.  Relative to all other editions this is greatly greatly overpriced for what you get.  But you're going to go ahead and buy it anyway, aren't you?  Make sure that you get the errata with the corrections and FAQs.  They included the wrong battle board with the game, and the game set up is incorrect.  Some very non-minor mistakes.  It's hard to understand how a company this large could make this many mistakes on producing a game.  [/rant off]

RATING: 4
* A very cheap way to re-issue a game we already won and which, IMHO, was one of the best of the A&A line so far...

* Game is very broken: The Japanese have so many aircraft (What on earth justifies that, by the way???!!!) -and all the time in the world if they play it smart- that they can deal with any opposition and fight the important battles one by one and win them easily with their massive air superiority. Many times in our games the Japanese player didn't even know where to field his aircraft as he didn't see any reason to even further strengthen a certain battle.... Once the Americans are finally strong enough to do anything about it, it's too late already.

* The rulebook has been virtually completely been overruled by now by online errata. A complete and new  (online) version wouldn't hurt...

* It was more than obvious that WoTC too hastily released the product just to be able to sell it before Christmas.

Still gave it a 4 rather than a 1 or 2 because I think no game can really be that bad and as far as I know I've never given a game a 10 either, because every game has at least some detail you don't agree with, but I'm really hoping A&A Europe 1940 will be a lot better than this one!

I have not really a plan how the Japanese could gain the 6 cities. That´s a hard game for the Axis. The 1st error you can make with the Japanese Army is IMO to fight with full force against the chinese troops. That will only gain time for their Allies.

I always play Pacific with the Europe board attached.  Axis and Allies is a classic and the scale of this version appeals to WW2 game fans.  The addition of the ANZAC power really adds a new dimension to the Pacific, and the options in front of you as any faction are diverse and require acute calculation of opportunity costs.  It's a long game but good fun.

RATING: 6
The rating is for the 2nd ed, Pacific board only, i.e. not for 1940 Global.

A&A taken at the new level of complexity and scale. Unfortunately, the game takes too long and the components are less functional than they should be.

The components are good overall but are lacking in functionality. The board is big and colourful, which makes it great to look at, except when you need to see the borders of provinces at a glance. There are lots of plastic miniatures of good quality. Most of them also look good although there are a few exceptions, especially in the 2nd edition, e.g. ANZAC mech inf, which is an ugly lump of plastic. Many units are nation specific, that is the sculpt is based on some iconic tank, plane etc type. The 2nd edition has more of these specific sculpts. Unfortunately not all the sculpts are sufficiently distinctive. For instance, Japanese strategic bombers look very much like British tactical bombers, which confuses new players: which bomber type are these planes?. 2nd edition ANZAC faction is the worst in this regard. For instance, its transports, cruisers and destroyers look very much the same from the distance. In general, you have enough of the units, however, in our games we keep running out of plastic chips and certain pieces, such as Japanese planes. Surprisingly, there are no China artillery or plane pieces in the game. You can substitute them with US pieces and it does not matter for most of the game but …  seriously ? - the game costs about 100 USD!  The cardboard components are OK, except the cardboard of the 1st edition, which was too thin to be picked up comfortably. Unlike in most earlier A&A games there is no paper IPC provided, which is a shame considering the high cost of the game. Inexplicably, there is no system for moving big armies around despite the facts that this game has bigger armies than previous A&A games and that simple solutions to this problem have been already invented, see e.g. the battle cards of the Revised edition.

The first edition was a disaster as regards gameplay. I wonder what Larry thought when he conceived such a biased setup (biased in favour of Japan). I do not have enough game experience to judge the setup of the 2nd edition but it appears solid. The gameplay has some further flaws. The map is big but constrained. Large parts of it are irrelevant, such as Russia (which is used only in a global game) or the small islands in the South East part of Pacific.  This may be somewhat historic but it is also makes the game duller. The same applies to the so called national advantages, i.e. bonus money, which are supposedly historic. The bonuses could be an excellent way to make alternative strategies viable. Unfortunately, many of the bonuses constrain rather than enable.  The rules are more complex than in previous A&A games primarily due political rules and airfields and ports. I do not like the political rules because they make the early game boring for some players unless you play with two or three. The game is more ‘massive’ than earlier editions, including the Anniversary edition. That is, bigger map, more money and units etc. This is both good and bad. Good because it gives scope and makes individual die rolls less important. Bad because it makes the games long:  approximately 6-7 hours.  

The following comment is about 1940 Global. You have a huge map, tons of units a lot of money to customize your armies. Is it good? Well it depends. Do you have a dedicated group of players who are willing to spend 15-20 hours on a game? Obviously, you cannot reasonably do it in one sitting. So you also need a spare table in a quiet corner because it is not reasonable to pack the game between the sessions. Did I mention that you need a really big spare table: like 1,5m x 1m? In short, I think the Global game is too demanding for most groups.  As regards the global gameplay on the Pacific side then the setup is the same but the main difference comes from the fact that US is free to decide where to focus on Pacific or Atlantic. That said, I think that there is too little interaction between the Pacific and Europe boards.  This is further reinforced by some of the National Advantages. You also have the random and unbalanced optional technology rules. This is no news, of course. A&A tech always have been this way.

Axis & Allies Pacific 1940 finally gives players the chance to play an in depth World War II Pacific theater low level war game that is playable from start to finish in one long day.  The game is polished and final edited/tweaked rules are available online.  This is a fun game to play and does require a little bit of deep thinking compared to earlier Axis & Allies games.  This game is a must have for the Axis & Allies enthusiast.

Awesome game.  In fact, this version is better than the original.  It is extremely well balanced.  While it is still too dependant on dice, the amount of units in combat situations has greatly reduced, thus it is much easier to determine win/loss probability compared to the original game.  That is a victory for anyone who plays these games and would prefer not to setup a laptop computer next to the game board!

Played the Global Revised (2nd edition) Rules only. Excellent game, and one that I look forward to playing again now that I understand how new rules, units, and National Objectives work. Quite a bit more rules introduced (and playtime, since it starts at 1940!) in this version.

Especially fun are the naval bases and airbases. Very strong advantages and each provides some interesting opportunities for clever play. I also appreciate the nuances provided by the political rules. It will be fun to explore different approaches with the various powers. 

The downsides of this game are the production quality issues. There is no money included in the game. There are boxes for the powers' units and you basically must dump all these pieces (along with the control markers) into one box. As a result, digging through to find a particular piece is a pain. A third gripe I have is with the board. While it looks beautiful and the spaces are fully functional, the peripheral could easily fit a quick Order of Play reminder, perhaps with starting income. Additionally, it would be nice to have a player aid that listed the powers' national objectives. Most of the rules referencing was just re-referencing these national objectives. And each game only comes with 6 dice?

Overall though, it was a great game experience. Rating it based on a 2-player game only, as I think it would suffer with more players, due to the extended downtime and lack of coordination between allied powers.

I like these 1940 series far more then the original game from the 80's. More detailed. I like best how China is broken up into numerous regions and their troops grow like the grass if not dealt with. ANZAC force acts separately from British forces.

If you like A&A then I'd say Larry Harris does it again.Unfortunatly Wizards of the Coast published the game and did such a shameful job I couldn't recommend it to anyone but fans of the franchise...I've revised my score from a six to a seven since WotC sent me some tac bombers and proper battle strip but I'm still disappointed by the pathetic production quality in an otherwise great A&A game(you need press-on nails to pick this stuff up and the national production chart only goes to 48(?)nor does it include National Objectives(??),extensive errata,etc). I'm hopeful E40 will "fix" some of the issues I have. For one stacks of Soviet's may balance P40 by pinning down Japan's rather small initial land forces and an August release could result in more thorough production quality as it seems P40 was rushed to make a christmas release date. Despite these problems it is still my A&A game of choice and I will buy E40 on release.

RATING: 5
Comments apply to A&A Global 1940:

The game, which gets my best A&A rating, is the latest effort to make A&A less deterministic and I think it has succeeded in giving players more options. You can get more varied outcomes instead of the usual "get-to-Moscow" gambit. However, it achieves this at the cost of being a much more complex game, with a lot more rules and a lot more fiddlyness. And a lot more $$$ too.

And again, playing to the end is just absolutely ridiculous (I don't know why A&A can't fix this perennial problem). One side should just resign when it's clear they're losing.

As for downtime, it is actually not too bad as players can sometimes run moves concurrently on the Europe and Pacific side (because this game is so huge) if they don't affect each other. The double-hatting of certain roles also breaks up the downtime for some players.

[b]Components[/b]: Hasbro has the resources to mass-produce some of the best pieces and boards in the industry.

[b]Rules and Mechanics[/b]: Contrary to popular belief, there is very little luck in A&A games.  Ironically this is due to so many dice rolled each combat: the more dice rolled, the more the results approach statistically expected outcomes.  Good players simply do not lose to worse players.  The last person I taught this game to reckoned that the game was 50% luck dependent after his first game.  After his tenth game he revised his estimate down to 5-10%.

[b]Overall[/b]:  A great PTO-focused version of a classic game.  It may not be an accurate simulation of the second World War, but verisimilitude is not always necessary to make a solid light wargame.  The A&A system really never gets boring for me because it rewards the ability to "read" the state of the board and respond dynamically.  The game is really long if played until the bitter end, so don't; just play until one player's will is broken.

Full disclosure: I have only played this game when combined with Axis & Allies 1940 Pacific, and therefore I am really reviewing the combined products.  That said, I love the combined game.  The aesthetics are nice overall; the models are very cool and differinitaled for all powers (Italy shares a few things with Germany), the map is well designed,, and IN GENERAL you have adequate pieces for most usual scenarios.

The scope of the game is epic, with a board no basketball player could reach across (widthwise).  With our group of friends, we tend to play long grueling games that grind for well over 10 hours; but that's the way we like it!  If that's not for you, I would avoid a game that can takes almost an hour to set up.

Downsides:  This game out of the box was grossly unbalanced against the Axis.  While I have no love for the historical Axis, this makes for a boring game.  There are many errata for poorly tested rules, and at least 4 alternative set ups that I am aware of.  We tend to use the Alpha 2 set up, which just kind of gives the Axis a bit more opening punch and changes the objectives sensibly.  We have found Alpha 2 quite balanced, and without having to learn a completely new set up and gameplay rules that some of the others have.

There are not enough Tactical bombers for the Japanese.
Overall there could be more chips, but crafty gamers can use substitutes or in our case plunder other A&A games.

In spite of all this, I am admittedly still stunned by the grand nature of the combined map, and I find it hard to go back to the smaller boards after the playing this one.  A&A 1940 is far from the best A&A, and certainly not the best thought out/play tested.  That said, with a few adjustment and home rules (BGG has tons), A&A 1940 will scratch even the most persistent WW 2 gamer itch!

Once again an Axis and Allies variant falls prey to the dread "Christmas Effect" as its positive points are overwhelmed by a tidal wave of mistakes caused by its obvious lack of intense play-testing. Play-testing sessions that would have pushed its release date beyond the 2009 Holiday season and so were never done. 

First: its published rules lack complete coverage of neutral's actions from 1940 to 1942 and this in a game that starts in 1940 with most of the players neutral. In fact, the game requires use of major, extensive errata.  

Second: The Japanese Empire starts much too strong. For example: it has an air force that outnumbers the US, British, Australian, New Zealand and Chinese air forces COMBINED. And remember, for the first three turns the American, British and Anzac air forces are neutral and out of the game. 

Third: the Chinese are once again much, much too weak. They are so weak the Japanese can easily conquer China with just the units already there and less than a third of their initial air force. (I.E., they have no particular need to produce much of anything on the Asian mainland).

Four: the American navy and the American economy are too weak. For the first three turns the US produces only 17 PCs per turn and so can NEVER overwhelm the Japanese economy. As, by the time the American economy reaches its peak, the Japanese have had enough time to conquer most of China, the South Pacific and their national objectives and so bulk up its economic muscle virtually to the US level. 

Fifth: even beyond this, the game is unbalanced. The Japanese navy starts so strong they can temporarily ignore the Philippine’s garrison and their own national objectives, take the majority of their naval and air forces to the west coast of the US and just anchor off of San Francisco. By the time the US enters the war and defeats this fleet by repeated attritional suicide attacks the game will be over. It simply takes the US much too long to get into the game in any event: three neutral turns, a war-economy bonus build starting at the end of the fourth turn and then two turns to get this fleet into Japanese waters. That's a minimum of 6 turns to affect the game with no particular Japanese actions. And remember a good Japanese player has parked a suicide fleet off San Francisco to delay this action for 2 or 3 more turns anyway.

Sixth: there are physical problems. While the map is beautiful, the game doesn't come with paper money, the set-up and battle board has errors, the cost chart is only shown once in a multi-player game and there aren't enough of the various plastic pieces needed to play the actual game. All this being a sure sign of a rushed production. 

Bottom line: save your money for a game developed and balanced BEFORE it was printed. 

Update 02/17/2010: After playing this game another 2 or 3 times I decided to up my rating from 4 to 6. After all, playing any game 6 times says something about its quality all by itself. Now while this game does have problems with extensive errata, historicity (the New Zealand air force is a power to be reckoned with), play balance and component quality (some of the pieces leave you with the distinct impression the publisher was more interested in saving a few cents worth of cardboard then in providing you with a superior $90 game, plus the battle strip is from the wrong edition, the production track can’t handle American or late war Japanese totals, the set-up chart is wrong, the map has errors, there aren’t enough Japanese Tac bombers to simulate a Pacific island campaign and the rules as written do not fully cover how neutrals interact) if you put in the development time the publishers didn’t in their rush to get this game out the door you do end up with a playable game.

Along with A&A Europe 1940, this is the grandest of all A&A incarnations and one to keep, even though there are plenty of other similar styled games today. If you need 1 A&A game, this one, along with A&A Europe 1940 is the one to have.

Huge fan of Axis and Allies.  I still have the old battered 1984 edition.  I loved the Anniversary edition last year.  A friend of mine bought AAP1940 game last week and we played it. On the plus side the map is spectacular.  I love the addition of more territories in Australia, the increase in islands and the possibility of Mongolia being playable.  I did like the addition of the ANZAC player and the increase in Chinese territories.  That said the game has problems.  As others have said they really went cheap on this game.  Not enough tac bombers, no money, a ridiculously small and inaccurate battle board and no units for other neutral powers like France, Holland or the Mongolians.  The game seems to assume that France and Holland have already fallen to Germany.  This is somewhat confusing since I read interview with a game designer who spoke about French units being part of the forthcoming European game.   I am hoping that there will be rules and pieces for the Neutral Powers like Mongolia, Spain, Turkey, Sweden and Switzerland in AAEurope: 1940.  Given how badly they did with Pacific I tend to doubt it.  My group is working on house rules to solve some of these problems and cannibalizing units from previous games to make up for the lack of money and neutral units.  I will probably get a 2nd set to solve the issue of Tac Bombers. Given its limitations I would recommend: 1) Getting the Game and then 2) Calling up the  manufacturer and complaining.

My group has played the “Global” option (this combined with Axis & Allies Europe 1940), and had a good time, as much for the company as for the history. I don’t own it and won’t buy it. It’s WWII in very broad brush strokes with no time scale. It follows the historical pattern, roughly. The three Axis dudes make some impressive advances (even Italy if played right) at first, but, if they don’t win via the victory conditions or talk the Allies into giving up, the Allies will win, a long long time from now. The map’s pretty and the pieces are what they should be, little toys to attract folks, but I could have done with 5/8” counters instead. The ships are bad; it’s hard to distinguish between cruisers, destroyers, and transports. Our group can accommodate eight players, but one waits a while between turns (ideally plotting purchases and moves).

I used to play A&A since my youth, now I'm playing it with my kids. I like Pacific more than Europe because it's full of strategic and diplomatic possibilities and logistics play an even bigger role on your road to victory than in Europe. 

Of course, it's also good for playing combined.

The best Axis and Allies yet, Awesome gameplay,  This game is not broken!!!  The lack of plastic industrial complexes and bases don't matter because the cardboard pieces are better as they don't clutter up the board as much.  I don't use play money because frankly it slows the game down and it's a pain anyway.  It would be nice to have a few extra Jap tac bombers but it's not essential.  Bring on Europe 1940!! (Received new battlestrip and some more Jap tac bombers after contacting wizards!)

It's a fun game if you have the time and people to play it with. The thing that ruined this version for me was all the problems with it though, the rule book, map misprints and the fact that I was missing pieces. Although they did send me replacement pieces free of charge so that was pretty awesome of them.

Nice game! to celebrate 25 years of wargaming since first getting Axis & Allies for my birthday in 1985, I went and bought A&A:Europe 1940 and A&A: Pacific 1940 as a combined birthday/Christmas present for myself.

After 1 playthrough, I really like this one!Even though I have a good size collection of 'serious' wargames, and 25 years of gaming experience since my last A&A acquisition, I found this fun, fast, and simple yet just enough 'chrome' to add a bit of interest and depth. I'm looking forward to giving A&A Europe a go, and the 'Global' campaign!

Yes, this is still not a 'simulation' by any stretch, but it is still a wargame. I think of it as 'junk-food' wargaming: fun, tasty, and quick: A nice treat now and then, but I wouldn't want it everyday.

The rating is based on 1 play, so it may trend up or down depending on whether it holds up to repeat playings.

I absolutely love the theme of this game and I love Axis and Allies. However, this game takes way too long to play and I find that this version heavily favours the Japanese. It's almost impossible to win as the US/the Allies. Also, the time commitment to play this game is very high and players can often play six or more hours without knowing who is going to win.

RATING: 7
Interesting Pacific theater Axis and Allies version.  I have been enjoying the Axis and Allies Battle series (DDay,Guadacanal, Bulge) more than the original/revised games so I was curious about what I would think of this game.  I find it a good deal closer to the original Axis and Allies format -- longer playing time than the battle games and it still has essentially the same cumbersome unit purchase phase each turn as classic A&A.  Not a bad game by any stretch and the focus on a specific theater allows for a bit more depth than the world wide version but not a particular favorite either after a first (exploratory) play.

This game got me so excited when it came out. I picked it up the day my daughter was born when I had to give my wife and newborn a chance to rest. The play I had really dampened my mood. I also found the components and flavor rules a bit sketchy. I don't know exactly why yet, but this game has put me off on any new Axis and Allies products. This trend downhill started with the Guadalcanal game and things just got worse and worse. I do want to play it again, and perhaps if I do, the rating will go up. It stays where it is for now.

I love Axis and Allies, and I love this incarnation. Tremendous pieces, awesome map and great gameplay.

However a great great game that I just wish I could get to the table more.

Sold without playing.

Ken:
Purchased on the strength of childhood nostalgia.  Wife uninterested.  Fiddly (particularly compared to other early purchases), and able to be sold for a significant profit.

Would be willing to play with the right group.  No chance of future re-acquisition.

Kathleen:
I agree - wife was uninterested.  At the time, early in my gaming experience, the game was entirely overwhelming - rules, board, components, et al.  I would describe myself as unsure, now - the theme appeals, as does the gameplay, in theory.  Would probably prefer a smaller version.

Rating is for the Global Version Alpha 3: 

Not fully baked by any means. The rules are a mess and there are silly little things that just strike me as wrong, like the French continuing to fight after Paris falls. 

Naval movement is too fast,and the game is trying to be more than the mechanics allow for. This leads to gamey tactic winning the day. 

I also have a problem with a game where the axis are trying to run wild until the US joins and saves the day. 
IMHO the US and Russia make way too much money at the start of the game.

For me, if I am going to invest as much time and effort as it takes to play the global game, I would rather play something I know works better, like TI3 or Europe Engulfed or World in Flames. 

This is a shame since the anniversary edition plays fine.. this version just is trying to hard to be more than it should.

As a standalone game, this one is kind of 'meh.' While having China as a semi-significant force is cool—and the Aussie units are really delightful—there isn't very much that is memorable about this game. Compared to Europe 1940, and even the original Pacific, this is a bit of a lackluster edition. However, the big appeal to owning this edition is being able to combine it with Europe 1940 to form a Global 1940 game, and for that reason I do think this is a reasonable purchase.

Only got one game in so far.  I absolutely love Axis and Allies but despite this I can't help but feel a bit disappointed by this - the game is very expensive (I think possibly the most expensive board game I've ever bought!) but the components don't warrant this price.  They're good, but not that good.  There's also an annoyingly large number of printing errors in the setup charts and the lack of paper money and plastic AA guns seems a bit cheap given the price point.

However, the game itself seems like a lot of fun.  I like the new units, I like the inclusion of simple politics rules, I like the way China is handled and I like the naval bases and air strips.

With a couple of rule tweaks and a proper errata I think this will probably be one of the best Axis and Allies games.  I'll definitely be picking up the 1940 Europe game when it comes out as the thought of playing a world game that size is just too alluring.

In my book, the best light-feel wargame there is, however it does drag out and tends to require 12+ hour sessions to complete when combined with the 1940 Europe set for a A&A 1940 Global experience (the best way to play it).

Very luck based game, dont expect realism here.

Europe also has better production values compared to Pacific, since that was riddled with some rather inexcusable mistakes (wrong battleboard & missing Japanse tac. bomber pieces.

After the revisied rules by Larry the gameplay increased as such I'm rating this game from a 5.5 to a 6.

If you have 1 bad roll with the axis in a large battle the game is over.

[1 play] [3 players] All of my comments are preliminary until I can get in another play. I'm going to play rough in these comments, so keep in mind that I am an A&A fan (I think 2004 Revised is a wonderful 2 player game), and that no matter how cruel I sound, I'm still giving this game a "7".

When did Larry Harris and Glenn Drover become secret lovers? What other explanation can there be for Larry's recent obsession with giant game boards, extremely lengthy games, and rules requiring many corrections and errata?

(OK, mostly jesting there, I respect Drover for Age of Empires III and Harris for the A&A franchise.) But seriously, this recent trend of A&A Anniversary and now these 1940 games is not promising as far as I'm concerned. More isn't always better, and lengthier rarely is better.

There are nice things going on in here. I like the way some of the units interact and I think some of the rule implementations like convoys are interesting concepts - provided they prove any sort of viable strategy for either side to employ. I enjoyed playing this and will happily do so again because I enjoy the A&A style of games. But even though I hate to say it, I think the original A&A:P offers just as much fun for me - in a more compact package, rule set, and time frame. The original A&AP has more versatile victory conditions as well. In 1940, Japan reaches a point where it can not win, and yet the game could potentially still go on for hours.

One last knock is that I clearly see AH (Wizards) milking the cow here. Quality delivered for the price offered is shameful. A corporate bean counter was making many of the calls here, and it shows. I hope they hear about it, and I hope the legions of die hard fans hold them accountable in the future.

Most recent play 1-8-10 with Carter and Garrett.

Another big AA game - should combine well with AA Europe 1940 for the Global game.

RATING: 7
Not steep in realism, nor strategic options (China seems weak enough that it seems advantageous for Japan to pick on it first), and certainly pricey. Not a fan of the National Objectives either. Global is a sight to behold though, and a very good play too, especially with the added realism rules (and cards) I designed for it.

RATING: N/A
No rating because i have not played it. 

The componenets (apart from the minis) are of a very very poor qualty for a premium priced game that is billed as having 'De luxe' components.

The board is fold over, thin and has unattractive indents.

The counters are incredibly thin

The rule book is paper and not glossy

It can't be played straight out of the box

The are serious errors and ommsions in the rule book and the set up - so it can not be played out of the box

Fine in a game not billled as 'Deluxe' - not Ok in something that is and priced as such.

I really love this series, I just wish more people near me played.

My copy is pretty much new. I've played 2 times and that is all. Getting a game started is hard, and I have sadly realized that pursuing A&A: Europe 1940 is just a waste for me.

Great game! I absolutely love the way it plays. Yes it seems Japan WOULD be overpowering but it really is not.  THink it is just right in terms of balance.

You'll hear people complain about the cardboard chits and the fact they have some errata for the set up and short what should be more Japanese Tac Bombers.

I found the shortness of the tac bombers while an issue it was not that big. 

Cardboard chits...well I cannibalized 42' version so no issue for me.  GOt it for $20 so not bad either.

Gave my first editions to a friend.

Traded away my first edition to a friend and picked up these copies.  Great general fun game.  Not my favorite but if have a good opponent it can be fun.

Also using the minis in HBG's 1939 and hopefully 1936 game.

Axis & Allies celebrates 25 years of strategy war gaming with a deluxe edition of its original theater-level game. Axis & Allies Pacific 1940, designed and developed by Larry Harris, utilizes the updated rules established in A&A Anniversary Edition. Two new combat units debut in this game, Tactical Bombers and Mechanized Infantry. Australia and New Zealand, joined together as the ANZAC forces, represent a new playable ally. China fields more forces than ever before, but will need help from their allies -- the United States and England -- to withstand the might of expansionist Imperial Japan.

Axis & Allies Pacific 1940 features an oversized board that measures 35 inches wide by 32 inches high (89 x 81 cm). With over 450 pieces, deluxe game components and local storage boxes, this game raises the standard established by A&A Anniversary Edition. All new rules for neutral nations, naval & air bases, kamikaze attacks and convoy disruption add even more depth and historical accuracy to this giant game.

Finally, this deluxe theater-level game is designed to join together with Axis & Allies Europe 1940 to create the greatest Axis & Allies experience to date! When joined, these boards will measure 5 feet wide by 32 inches high (178 x 81 cm). Both games have been designed to play alone or together to offer a 2-6 player global 1940 scenario, complete with separate set up and national objectives.

Love it. It's a little funner than Axis & Allies Europe 1940 on it's own. But the most pleasurable is when you put the Europe and Pacific together!

RATING: 7
11/5/17 Update-Haven't played enough to see if the base game is as broken as people claim but it does seem to favor the Japanese in terms of both their overwhelming initial starting forces superiority plus a very weak China who can't possibly stay afloat for more than a few rounds if the Japs simply take their starting mainland units and push through. All in all i like the additions of Tac Bombers, naval/air bases, mech infantry, etc and I will probably play more often once I have found some good play balancing variants or the improved rules.

If you like A&A revised or 50th anniversary edition you should see this as an improvement.

Have only had experience with this as part of the global version.  An excellent iteration in the Axis & Allies franchise, certainly the best of the grand strategic scale games.  This is no longer the simple game it used to be, but the game is better.  The addition of the National objectives alone make it a much better game, as Japan has some impetus to play historically, and if they're going to win the game, will likely have to accomplish a few of its historical goals first.  The addition of China and the Anzac forces is also a nice bit of chrome that adds realism without much overhead.

I was pretty sold on this until I found out it will not have the VP clock of the original AAP.  AA50 will be sufficient, I think, considering how infrequently I play this series now, despite the same problem in it.

Considering how many shots LH & Co. have had at redesigning this thing, I'm really stunned at the piss-poor victory conditions.

Having pretty much all the A&A games since the original, I have to admit this is an excellent version to own, not just for its own merit but for a smooth interface with the Europe 1940 version.  I like the expanded areas of the of the Pacific with more sea zones to contend with.  Worth getting if you don't have the original and probably still worth getting if you have the anniversary edition for the huge playing area available.

I enjoy AAA Global, but to be honest, I don't think it adds much compared to AAA Europe. AAA Pacific is good if one player is significantly better than the others, as it allows a team of decent players to take on that one guy who always wins for whatever team he is on. However, I think it requires players good enough to coordinate Allied strategy, but not so good that they are guaranteed to obliterate Japan; the player controlling Japan has to be really good to shift strategy to deal with the Allies, but not so much better than the competition that they win before USA can join in.

I personally have a gaming group where this is true, but I realize it is an extremely specific situation. If you only get one, buy AAA Europe instead.

My comment for this will be the same as my comment for the Europe version:

Playing the two games together is an experience you won't forget. However, prepare to set aside a couple of days to do it. The setup time alone takes as much as playing other games. I've only been able to do it twice, but if I could get a group together to do it again, I would.

Nice evolution of the A&A system.  I like it better than Europe 1940 because the piece density is lower and there are more options in how to proceed.  It still has the problem that there's no reason to keep playing once the tide has turned against the Axis (unless you just like the experience of playing it out)--a problem that had been fixed in the first A&A: Pacific game, but regressed with this game.

Great Variant of the classic, I've only played it together with Europe 1940, so I can't say much about the Pacific only variant. The combined map is just huge, the additional Nations and units bring a lot of chrome and new tactics, but they also increase playtime heavily. And that's the game's largest problem: You'll need at least a whole weekend to play a single game!

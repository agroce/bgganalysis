RATING: 8
This is an initial rating based on one mission having been played.  Once I have played the entire set of missions, I may or may not change this rating...

Descent Road to Legend is my all-time favorite board game.  XCOM was one of my all-time favorite computer games.  Doom (the board game) is the bastard love child of Descent RtL and XCOM.  One might think that I would fall head-over-heels in love with Doom...  One would be incorrect.  I did like it, but found it fiddly and difficult to bring to the table.  Oh, I forgot to mention the tremendous work load placed on the poor slob who has to run all the monsters and keep all those fiddly rules straight.

Level 7 Omega Protocol is "Diet Doom".  It does not have the full taste of Doom, but it is a suitable alternative.  The adrenaline-fueled "dashboard" of the Overseer is very cool.  I never felt overwhelmed as the Overseer (this may change as different types of critters get added).

In short, L7OP is a fun/light Doom clone that scratches that tactical itch.

By far my favorite game I own.
This is the one game that just oozes theme so much, you would expect a puddle of it to be on the table.
Artwork is top notch, rules are very clear, each role plays completely different.
From the very first mission the game sucks you in and makes you feel like you are this bad ass space marine.
The overlord loses the first few badly, but after a certain point you will be cowering in fear of what lurks behind every door and sweating with anticipation when the timer hits that critical mark, terrified what is going to happen.
I could not recommend this game enough for the dungeon crawlers.

I was skeptical at first, now knowing what new could come from yet another dungeon crawler other than the sci-fi setting. I was positively surprise by the following:
- the theme consistent with the game play
- the cone of sight and calculating the distance
- having multiple stances to choose from and therefore different game play every turn
- balance between players and overlord
- the speed of the game, a lot better than its more famous counterparts

Overall, an honest 8. Will play again.

El sistema de juego es muy sólido y no le he visto pegas por el momento (la línea de visión es un poco rara pero te acostumbras)

Las minis venían TODAS brutalmente dobladas (literalmente: aplastadas). Ahora están bien. Me pasé un buen rato enderezándolas con agua caliente. Curiosamente las minis de los comandos venían perfectas. Las minis son todas de un plástico blandito y malucho pero tienen bastante detalle. 

Las tiles no son muy gruesas y parecen maluchas cuando las destroquelas. Si las comparas con los materiales típicos de FFG se nota la diferencia. No obstante una vez que estas jugando cumplen perfectamente su cometido y no se doblan ni nada por el estilo.

Aunque pueda parecerse temáticamente al Sedition Wars o Space Hulk, yo lo compararía más con juegos como Doom o Descent donde los personajes cooperan contra un único jugador enemigo, tienen personajes configurables y el malo de turno puede sacarse eventos y "putadillas" de la manga para ponerles las cosas difíciles.

Initial rating after 1 play.

A very tidy and fast paced dungeon crawler. The adrenaline mechanism is intuitive and apart from some fiddliness with line-of-sight (which is always a pain in a tile based game)most of the mechanisms just flat out work. Very eager to play more of this!

RATING: 8
Un buen juego en general.
PROS:
- El sistema de traspaso de adrenalina del overseer a los comandos es sencilla, equilibrada y elegante.
- No es un juego difícil de jugar.
- No es muy caro para los componentes que trae.
- Es muy importante la colaboración entre los comandos.

CONTRAS:
- Hay algunas cosas un tanto confusas como la línea de visión y algunas reglas concretas.
- Está en inglés (para quien le sea un problema)
- La calidad del plástico de la miniatura no es muy allá. De hecho algunas vienen dobladas.
- El setup de cartas inicial puede ser un poco arduo al principio tanto para el overseer como para los comandos. Después la cosa va fluida..
- Sensación de que es fácil para los comandos, al menos en las tres primeras misiones (que es hasta donde lo he probado).

RATING: 8
Initial Impression: This is a very thematic scifi tactic minis game. The objectives are simple but achieving them can be subtly difficult. The adrenal system is similar to Stronghold's hourglass system in that the more you do, the more options you give to your opponent. This creates a nice balancing act where you can starve your opponent's resources. I'm looking forward to playing through all the scenarios in the game.

Excellent game.  Far away from Level7-Escape.  A good gamer will crush the opposite team so it must be played with "same level" gamers.  otherwise it's a lot of suspens, crucial choices and "wooooh I'm Ripley in AlienS".  If you prefer SF/horror more than Heroic-Fantasy you can easily replace Descent V2 with it.  Different tastes.

Bog-standard miniature game. Open door, spawn monsters, shoot. Repeat until your marines die from boredom. Very repetitive.

Brilliant sci-fi dungeon crawler with a Space Hulk-esque theme and a great mechanic for the 'overlord' - adrenaline.  The more the good guys do, the more the overlord gets to spend to fight back!

Decent scenarios too.. only downside is the quality of the cardboard and miniatures is a bit on the cheap side.  Still, brilliant!

I will probably rate this higher after I get a chance to play the game as a commando, and not the Overseer.  The Overseer seems way overmatched and doesn't make the game fun from that perspective.  The guys playing the commandos seem to have a blast though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Think a more complex/in-depth version of Space Hulk.  If you don't know Space Hulk, think the "Aliens" movie in a board game format.  Basically you run around killing aliens. One player plays the Aliens and (up to) the other five characters (space marines) are played against the Aliens.

The game self-balances fairly well, so winning or losing will often be the result of strategy/tactics with a little luck thrown in (die rolls).

The game board is flexible (buildable) and the game comes with nine initial scenarios.  I'm sure there will be expansions and even player created scenarios you can find via web searches.

I finally got around to learning how to play this. After I play it for real, I'm expecting a rating of ~8-8.2
This game really does feel like the tactical part of X-Com (the videogame).
This has a couple cool mechanisms, but I'm just not sure that I'll ever be in the mood for a tactical dungeon-crawler.

I'm pretty sure this makes Space Hulk obsolete.

Good sci-fi dungeon crawl mechanisms marred by balance and design issues.  The underlying mechanisms of the game (adrenaline system, overlord cooldown board, etc.) are excellent, though a bit fiddly, and make for a fun game to play.  Unfortunately the designers seem to have forgotten that the game needs to be fun for the overlord player too or nobody will play that role.  The countermeasures specialist makes the game tedious and "unfun" for the overlord and should be removed from the game - which is fine because the 5 marine game is hopelessly lopsided in favor of the marines anyway.

I like the game, but it's only fun with inexperienced players.  Once the marine players learn the most effective loadouts for their team and realize that the timer is nothing to worry about (because the crisis point does not increase the difficulty enough), it becomes too easy for them and, frankly, boring to play because they just turtle their way through the objectives - which has the added disadvantage of dragging the game on too long.

Similar in format to Descent however much less complex rules. I find Descent much more tactical and the additional complexity and theme of Descent make it a far superior game to this imo.

Pros: Tactical combat that encourages working as a team with different special powers that are chosen at the start of the game. Adrenaline mechanism between the teams is an elegant balancing mechanism.

Doesn't appear to have character growth and each scenario is separate.

I absolutely love this game. It is basically like the video game XCOM in terms of strategic maneuvering.

Seems to have crippling issues with balance.

Follow these simple steps to make the heroes OP:
1. First action of first hero - open door
2. All remaining actions - kill all enemies (this is easy, because you are always equipped with your best weapons)
3. Laugh at Overlord who can't do anything on his turn

Monster minis are uninspiring. Cardboard stock is OK. Artwork is a meh out of 10. I've been spoilt by FFG.

Going to see if this can be house ruled at some point in the future. If not, this is getting sold.

+ Not your average dungeon crawl / 1 vs. all game.  It changes up that standard formula enough to make it unique and get noticed.
+ I really like the adrenaline/fear system where the more actions the marines take the more power the aliens get to activate abilities and deploy bigger, badder aliens.
+ This is Aliens: Colonial Marines or Starship Troopers in a box.  Make no mistake.  It is SUPER THEMATIC.  I've felt my heart race a few times playing this.
- Still requires someone to be the bad guy.  My only gripe with 1 vs all games, imagine that!

Pros
-solid dungeon crawler with unknown elements (overseer can plan which room has what secretly)
-interesting adrenaline mechanic...actions taken by heroes are used to fuel overseer's actions
-engaging game play for good guys with stances to pick, managing adrenaline, activating abilities
-customizable heroes off the bat, instant gratification (compared to descent, where you need to level up over 40 hours)
-good movement rule (re: only 1 diagonal movement per turn)
-game book provides easy mode and hard mode
-cohesive story element

Cons
-unclear line of sight rules, rules about cover etc.
-rules seem arbitrary/overly complex, movement can only have 1 diagonal, but tracing distance can be counted with as many diagonals as needed...but as long as its in the same direction
-lack of variety in the long run (e.g. only 6 types of enemies)
-have to remember lots of extra rules each turn (e.g. auras/if you're withing 3 spaces of this character...)
-not as fun to play as overseer, they don't have any secret tools available (in descent you have a hand of cards you can use to react to heroes)
-heroes seem much stronger than overseer? the clones and enemies seem to die quite easily
-investigation tokens (i.e. treasure chests) provides useless items that are not worth taking
-no hard time limit for each mission, when crisis point is reached, overseer just gets a small bonus
-questionable map design: first few missions have two opposite direction paths to find something, and some doors are auto locked and cannot be opened...heroes that take the wrong path waste a lot of time
-some specific hero abilities seem overpowered, making taking that hero seem essential (e.g. strafing fire basically lets you shoot twice at no cost)
-heroes can heal at any time, can fully negate any damage overseer does (granted it comes with some cost)
-long game length, lengthy game setup
-expensive game, terrible box insert

I gave this game a lower rating for two reasons price and miniature quality. What did I pay $90 for? the minis out of the box were bent and flimsy, Privateer Press you are better than Milton Bradley!!!Id pay 50 even 60 for this game as is but if Im gonna drop big money for a game Id better be getting FF quality parts or even painted minis. 

That being said this game IS fun to play. It is what Space Hulk and Legions of Steel should have played like. Great game mechanics!! However the stance and equipment cards on each character can be unruly at times. 

**NOTE** Privateer Press fire your minis company.....give your game designer a raise. 

P.S. I really hope you have someone reading these comments.

Nice one-vs.-all dungeon-crawler in the tradition of Space Hulk, Descent, and Doom. Streamlined from those later games. The clever bit here is an action point economy where the more the players do, the harder the overlord can hit them back. Yet if the player are too cautious in their actions, the clock will run out ... so it is tense if you go slow, or if you go fast. Recommended.

A very awesome dungeon-crawler that's 1 vs many. The minis will likely need to be reshaped out of the box unless you want them to look like Michael Jackson stills, other than that the abilities are cool, and it's very balanced.

The scenarios are, indeed, quite unbalanced--both in and of themselves and in terms of number of commandos.
But man, Omega Protocol gets a lot right. The varied options for both the commandos and the Overseer; the tension of how to spend adrenaline; the balance of how many figures on the board. A great effort, totally out of the blue.

RATING: 9
Tension and horror are prevalent during play. Lvl 7, is slick, clever and sexy. A game where the overlord gets to do something shocker! But loses a point or 2 for having a few outstanding rules niggles (LOS), and the worst plastic ever used to make minis. Smashing a block of playdoh with a 28lb sledge would keep its shape better. But the new fresh mechanics here are awesome. Hoping to see an expansion one day.

This game is one of the best dungeon crawlers out there.
Components are top-notch, all is very intuitive, very asymetrical but balanced characters, with more than the usual options for the game-master & a pretty good replayability. If you liked Hero Quest or like Descent you'll love this one.

Unfortunately I really dislike dungeon crawlers by now, shure you could plan out everybodies move to the very last detail, but man does that feel like work & it's soooo boring.. it's all about maximization.. and no matter what, you're either the meek guy who's (hopefully) politely told what to do, the person who has the best tactical skills who tells others what their best action would be, or the one that knows but keeps his mouth shut & then looses interest after a while..

Well integrated theme and mechanics. The "adrenaline mechanic" works great to balance the overlord and the good guys. The different agent roles performs different.

The game plays a bit too long (would benefit from some streamlining) and has most of the problems other similar dungeon crawlers has (eg. long overlord downtime, focusing down single characters, player elimination).

I love dungeon crawlers and I'm a big fan of Descent first edition. For a long time it was the main dungeon crawler in my gaming group and we seldom played others like Mice & Mystics, for instance. As soon as we needed a fresh theme for our games I thought about Sci-Fi right away and started looking for that setting. This game seemed very appealing at first and, as soon as I played it for the first time, I realized it was just what we needed!! The mechanics are significantly different from Descent and the story and universe is very cool. My favorite features are the stances and the adrenaline mechanic where the bad guy gets to do "as much" as the good guys did. Don't expect Descent's components value, though. Highly recommended!!

RATING: 9
Probably one of my favorite one vs all, Dudes on a map game I own. A highly thematic, tactical game, with a good amount of variability and choices. I do not own the expansion, which increases the amount of variables, scenarios etc. The game emulates the movie "Aliens" better than the Legendary: Alien Encounters game, which is saying something to its thematic merits. 

My main gripe is that it can be taxing to teach, hence why it doesn't hit the table often, but I want it too. The game actually plays smooth and isn't necessarily hard, but there are a lot of little rules and abilities for each character, which can be harder to wrap your head around at times.

Another small nit pick is the the quality of miniatures. The detail is great, especially on the hero minis, but the alien miniatures use a softer plastic, so the mini will tend to bend and warp even after the hot/cold water treatment.

Overall if you want a highly thematic game that gives you a good amount of choices and tactics on how to handle every scenario, Level 7 [Omega Protocol] is a great fun game. It can be a bear to teach, but it will be a fun experience for either alien or human player.

Update: Another game that may wind up out the door because I can't get it to the table mostly because there is a a good amount of rules for the game. Ehh whatever. Game's I enjoy never hit the table, what else is new

Everything you do in this game counts. Which makes losing after 4 hours real soul-crushing ordeal. Regardless of side. This is one where I'm tempted to give it a 6 if going strictly by BGG's rubric.

2016-04-11 - Yeah, I just wish this was a pure coop. I don't like being the big bad guy, playing against everyone else. If someone else wanted to do that, this game might see the table more. I still think it's a good game, and I had fun when I played it... I would just always opt for a pure coop when given a choice. I'm lowering my rating to a 7.

2015-04-19 - This is a fun sci-fi themes dungeon crawl. I feels a lot like an Aliens themed board game, which is exactly the kind of game I have always wanted. I kind of wish it were full coop (especially since I will always play the Overseer), but the one vs many model has some definite advantages, too.

Great Ameritrash game. I really like the 'adrenaline' mechanism, where the more actions you take allow the Aliens to take more actions as well. The minis, while sculpted nicely, need to be dipped in hot water to level out the bases. A small quibble.

Good atmosphere, nice components and very playable.  There are a lot of ways to build the commando team and, much like Warmachine, there are some very nice combos built into the team.  The alien side is reminiscent of playing the Demons in Claustrophobia, with the alien player spending adrenaline on spawning, activating and special abilities.  The main weakness of the game is the seriously screwy LOS rules - we replaced them with the LOS rules from Imperial Assault, which seemed to be a good upgrade.

Dropped it two points after a recent play.  As experience with the game grows, I'm coming to perceive the adrenaline economy at its heart has some real issues and can be manipulated by a careful Overseer to yield unfortunate results.  Clones are too strong compared to the other enemy units.

I liked the mechanic that meant the more the commandos did, the more threats they would have to face from the overseer, but the game play is definitely more fun from the commando side of things than the overseer, especially if playing with 4 or 5 individual commandos, as it can drag for a bit while they are plotting their moves. I think that the game  tension and time to play would benefit from a one minute time limit from the end of the overseer turn to the turns orders assignment and first action taken by the commandos.

In [Omega Protocol], one player takes on the role of the Overseer while two to five other players take on the role of the elite Special Ops team. The Overseer's role in the game is to control all of the alien denizens and challenges the players face throughout the game. The players are trying to achieve specific scenario-based objectives by exploring a map that's laid out at the start and fighting off the hordes of aliens that the Overseer sends their way.

11/2014 Talked into trying this dungeon crawler game.  And again my impression of these games was confirmed: the old D&D role playing game format is much better for this genre.  Having a "game master" competing with the other players, and not necessarily playing to make a good experience for everyone feels anti-social and contradicts my perception of a good time playing board games.

Awesome, awesome game.  There is practically nothing I can say bad about it, other than the miniatures which were a little bent out of shape when I got it (but can be fixed by boiling).  Basically a tactical, sci-fi dungeon crawler that can be played in an hour or less.  Rules are relatively easy for this genre, and the theme and story-telling the game produces is stellar.  Some mechanics are very similar to Descent 2, but this "race"-style game works far better in a modern, "special ops" fire-fight setting. The developers hit a home run with mechanics, the adrenaline system is revolutionary.  I love this game, and I will be playing it a lot.

There is a lot you can do with this game to increase the re-playability, from creating your own scenarios to adding custom tiles and props.  The rules are flexible enough to basically allow you to sub in just about any terrain or figurines to play with.  I was thinking it would be cool to use Halo Mega Bloks mini-figures to create an entirely new story battling Flood or Covenant minions.  I think you could even use the rules in a fantasy setting with Descent minis.

Thematically, sci-fi tactical combat games are not my passion so that does diminish my love for this game just a bit.  Taking nothing away from the game-play.

RATING: 5
The overlord player feels underpowered. It will feel like you are being pushed around by the cool abilities the Hero players have.

Fun for the Heroes/Commandos, not so much for the Overlord/Dungeon Master/Whatever. 

Hero abilites feel like they are cheating, which is no fun at all, whereas the Overlord abilites are not as interesting as they should be and often too expensive for what they do.

Damage system is simplified, which I personally don't like very much. You either hit or miss and deal one, maybe two damage, but that's it. There is little to no variation in there.

The plastic minis are just bad. They are definitely the worst I have seen in a boardgame thus far. If you are used to FFG standard, these minis will make you cry after your money. They are not very beautiful or detailed and the plastic is basically pure rubber. Some say, you can fix it with hot water, which simply is not true. they are so soft, you can bend them even, when they are cold.

I don't think this game is worth its money.

Compared with other similar dungeon-crawl games such as Descent this probably has the best "heroes vs overlord"  mechanic of them all. The rules are easy to grasp, and there is a lot of gameplay in making strategic decisions.

-line of sight and determining cover is easier than in other games but is still confusing at times.   

Positive
+Great overlord vs heroes mechanic.
+Includes campaign rules and mission difficulty settings.

Great game with some minor nitpicking. First of all, what was going through the artwork designers mind with the miniatures versus character cards artwork? The Countermeasures Specialist miniature has his rifle up, but character card shows it down. The Rifleman is the exact revers of this. What this results in is constant confusion between the two to the point that I almost tossed the game board when playing this game with my fourteen year old son. Other than that? Yeah sure, there is the soft plastic factor that everyone else has mentioned. Basically, this is a game where is you paint the miniatures, as I did, it works much much better. Don't want to paint? Use a sharpie to distinguish between Rifleman and CM Specialist figures. Love this one otherwise.

This could be the best dungeon crawl out there. While playing this game, I felt absolutely immersed, as no other game ever done before. I was there, fighting for my life against weird creatures, surrounded only by my friends.

Until the rules ruined it. The movement rules (why only one diagonal?) and target system are awkward and takes you out of that amazing world and back to the table to discuss minor annoying details.

After the playing of just the first scenario, it feels pretty much the same as Doom, except here the heroes can win at normal level. Open up a door, the overseer populates the room. Blast through it with the usual actions - move, shoot with dice, heal. Open up the next room, blast through it. Continue until the mission objective is found. I like the concept of the overseer action options changing with each mission, and how throttling back hero actions auto-throttles back the overseer actions (reminiscent of Stronghold somewhat). I also like the stance and kit-out rules to provide variety for your characters (from Drizzt et al), as well as the campaign rule offering. I'll play through the scenarios and get value out of it, but I'm not sure that it otherwise has any whizz-bang factor that elevates it above the pack.

Great Sci-Fi dungeon crawler. Really liked this game and hope to play often. There is a lot to take in on the first game. Many cards to browse through and things to become familiar with. Because of this, set up of the first game almost takes as long as the game itself. With repeated play this surely will become more streamlined and faster. 

Once set-up is done though, this game just keeps being more and more fun. I might just have been lucky with the people I played with, but we had a lot of laughs while playing it. 

Theme is spot on as well! Great, great game.

Level 7: Omega Protocol is a dungeon-crawl game that's very much in the same vein as Descent.  One player takes the role of the overseer, who controls all the enemies in the dungeon, while the others take on individual fighters, each with his own special abilities.  The overseer player has some ability to customize the dungeon by seeding it with scenario-specified traps, treasures, and monster spawns in the various rooms.  The player characters, instead of having fixed attack and defense stats for the entire scenario, have a "stance" that determines their stats that they can set each turn, depending on what their plans are.  Perhaps the biggest innovation of the game is the resource system, called adrenaline.  Players can perform a variable number of actions, but each action they take puts adrenaline markers in the pool.  On the overseer's turn, he takes all the adrenaline used by the players and use that to perform his own actions.  Thus, the more ambitious the players are, the more the overseer can do.  (There are, of course, limits so the overseer can neither be completely starved or have more than he can possibly use.)  I thought this game compared favorably to Descent, and enjoyed the small improvements the system made, although the games did feel very similar.

adrenaline : als er niets inzit kan je het gebruiken door te betalen met adrenaline en als er nog adrenaline inzit moet je het refreshen elke ronde tot er niets meer inzit en dan pas kan je  het weer gebruiken door terug te betalen. 
bv cost 4-2 de vier is wat het kost om het bruikbaar te maken. bv  2 aliens inbrengen. dan liggen er 4 adrenaline in. de volgende ronde wordt er gerefreshed en neem je er 2 weg. pas de volgende ronde zijn er weer 2 weg en zijn ze alle vier weg en mag je terug betalen om het te activeren.

RATING: 10
Outstanding "dungeon crawler". Ranked too low in my opinion. Set-up times are long, so not suitable for spontaneous sessions. Play time 2-3 hours realistically, depending on number of players, but does not ever drag due to tight design, tension and player interaction. LOS rules can get fiddly if you overthink them. 95% of the time, LOS should be obvious and follow common sense. Due to different commando abilities and layouts, very re playable. Role of overseer challenging, but fun. Quality of alien figures an issue due to soft plastic, but once reshaped, will hold their shape if properly stored. Miniature quality improved in expansion. Campaign mode suffers from the fact that the entire campaign takes place within the course of a few hours, so no time to reequip, buff or boost between plays and a "rogue-like" (in video game parlance) mechanic of sudden failure in the event of a failed mission. Some house rules and not sticking to the script could solve this with more time between missions (like X-com where injured members are removed from the roster for a few missions and survivors can have stats increased). Do not buy for its campaign mode. Single missions are fantastic for gameplay.

01/01/14 - I like the mechanic for controlling the aliens and the whole customizing your character aspect. I wish they just printed the character sheets on a really thick card stock instead of the thin paper. The plastic on the aliens are pretty flimsy as well. The story is interesting but not written very well but it plays great. It was a little expensive but I'm glad to have it.

RATING: 8
This is my favorite dungeon crawl game. The overlord gets a board of activatable abilities, but the cute thing is the different abilities have different cooldown timers, represented by depleting the tokens you spent on the actions at different rates. The players get to do a certain number of actions on their turn, and each point they spend becomes currency for the overlord taking actions. The dice seemed well balanced, with few rolls missing completely. The heroes seemed to have meaningful choices not just in where they stood and who they shot, but they get different stance cards that effect their stats for that round.

The best dungeon crawl style game made. It has the best elements from many other games in this style. Great choices during setup and during play for the commandos (good guys), while the overseer (bad guy) has a streamlined set of options he can choose from each turn. 

Update - I still think it is a good dungeon crawl, but it seems to have some balance issues based on # of commandos. The setup time is also pretty intense.

RATING: 8
At this point I would say Level 7 is the best Dungeon Crawler as far as mechanics. Customizable equipment and character selection offers some awesome variety even before the game starts. Where the game separates itself from other dungeon crawlers is in its use of the adrenaline. If the commandos take a lot of actions then the overseer is able to take that adrenaline to cause various issues for the commandos. This is brilliant. It no longer feels like the overseer is just there to put out monsters but there is some real strategy, and a real threat for the commandos. Theme is another story, as far as mechanics Descent 2.0 and, I assume, Star Wars Imperial Assault are right on Descent's tail. They are all great dungeon crawlers, but for me I love the military squad feel of Level 7. I'm not a huge fan of the greys, aliens, but I overlook it because of the art for the maps and the amazing military feel of the game. I like Star Wars and a fantasy theme as well, but if I had to pick one, I would probably pick Level 7, due to the slight edge in mechanics and the even playing field for theme. Theme could make a difference for others though and tip the scale in favor of another game. Regardless, this is a phenomenal game. I don't know how anyone can make a dungeon crawler any better than Level 7, Descent 2, and Star wars Imperial Assault. **Wife:7.5

24-06-2014. Rated after 1 play. Hmm. I love Descent. I did not love Level7 after 1 play. 

I feel the game is drowned by excessive downtime, no tension if the overlord doesn't play it extremely right.  While I'll definitely will give the game more chances, the experience so far left me wanting more.

I do love the dashboard and stances! Those are great innovations. Those weren't enough to save the game from being downtime: the game yet.

This is not generally my style of game, but it was still enjoyable. It's a sharp game with constant tension. The swarm of little guys are easily picked off, but they can easily end up surrounding and swarming you if you don't stay on top of it. This just gave everything an action-packed, cinematic feel.

That being said, the game went way too long for what it was, but that might have just been the group I played in. Also, the rulebook seemed pretty obtuse with a lot of fiddly rules, but that seems par for the course with these games.

Still, good example of a dungeon crawl.

This is OK, but game seems inefficient. I've played too many tactical dungeon crawler type games. This seems to want to be more parred down and tactical than Descent and its ilk, but it loses to the following games:

Claustrophobia: Waaaay more efficient. Accomplishes like 75%+ of the depth of Level 7 in maybe less than a third of the time, with way less complexity. Claustrophobia's "weakness", lack of variety, is SHARED by level 7.

Earth Reborn: If you want a more in-depth and complex tactical game, then this game is way deeper.

The Rest: If you want more variety than Claustrophobia, then just about every game like this has more than Level 7, which is repetitive in comparison

[b]I'd Rather Play:[/b] Claustrophobia is the big one here. But really, insert almost any game like this that I like.

I like this game a lot, but I have a couple concerns about the game balance.  I really like the leveling up, the range of overseer abilities and the simulated cooldowns, and the range of tactics for the commandos.  I've read that the game has some balance issues for the overseer, actually, despite that our commandos typically struggle (or at least I perceive we do).  I think there's some min maxing state that we've yet to find.  I think the Seeker ability completely negates any defensive positioning we can come up with, so I'm not convinced these are trash mobs yet.  Maybe we need to focus on armor upgrades?

Mediocre dungeon crawl.  I really like selecting what kit my Spec Ops team members will use during the game.  The item cards were a huge disappointment both thematically and mechanically.  The Overseer's abilities are hit and miss in regards to theme, and the art is really drab and uninteresting.  I like the way the Overseer can change where objectives are, but it makes no sense from a theme perspective.  This Spec Ops team should know the layout, but the Overseer changes where the elevator and offices are? What?

Also, we apparently threw out the line of sight rules, because they are nonsense.  There were various other rulebook problems.  I know designing games like these is difficult, but I'm pretty annoyed that every dungeon crawl seems to be made by people who have real problems putting together a competent rules system.  

I found it interesting that none of us missed our attacks very often.  The dice are really focused on aggression.  Oh, and 'best with 5' seems obviously wrong.  We played with 3, and I only barely felt like I had enough to do.  If I was relegated to one character, I'd have been bored.

Great theme play.  Game is fairly easy to learn and play.  It will take a few plays to use all the cards and options available to their fullest extent.  Plays very similar to Descent and Mansions of Madness with theme from Space Hulk.  Components are good - mounted modular boards with very good artwork, thick cardboard chits, plastic playing pieces (although they were bent in awkward positions) and cardstock player mats.  Rulebook was unclear on some aspects.  Game length seems long for what it is.

Based on one play, this is a very tentative rating. Additional missions, variety in the actions for the overseer, how much difference the different kit options change things up could all affect the rating substantially.

So far though, so good. Mission 1 was moderately tense, offered some decent tactical choices and the dice seem to have enough hits on them that you should be able to kill what you're shooting at, so you're only playing gentle probabilities.

Some turns there is very little for a specific player to do. We had a round or two where one person passed and did nothing and a few where a player simply moved one space or so. The overseer also seems to have some downtime, but I didn't ask him whether he found it to be an issue.

The curvy, shoot around the corner bullets are clearly bullshit though.

Scfi adventure/dungeon crawl game.  Some Good mechanics, components.  

Have played first and second missions, very hard so far for the party.  The game does take alot of setup and is quite long, 3.5 hours and we completed the first mission (3 of us), second mission we failed and was along way off completing and that was about 3 hours. 

I do like the adrenaline system, very cool.

Only played as a player.

So in summary i think its ok, but there are better, shorter (in both play and setup), overlord/dungeon crawl games out there.

After the dreadful Level 7 Escape game, I was not expecting much from Omega Protocol. I also found myself wary of new dungeon crawler type games, as most of these have been disappointments these pas few years, and they did not offer me much beyond the excellent classics Space Hulk and Warhammer Quest. Except maybe for fiddly and sometimes convoluted rules. But what a pleasant surprise this was! Omega Protocol is atmosperic and very tactical. The options that you have each turn are really interesting, and the suspense is tangible. Cannot wait to play again. Too bad the price tag is really hefty.

This is a one vs. many miniature-based board game along the lines of Space Hulk. It has a neat mechanic I've actually seen before in older games, where the number of actions the overlord gets is based directly on how many actions the players take. The overlord is capped and players usually max out their actions though, so I'm not sure this aspect of the game is anything more than an illusion of choice. Still, it makes it easy to keep track of actions for all players and in the end that makes it a useful procedure.

Where the game shines is in unit customization. There is a whole slew of options and load outs for each of the game's characters, allowing players to build exactly the squad they want. This part of the game feels a lot like X-com and is likely the aspect that will draw most people to it. Play is entirely scenario-based and while the small number that comes with the game seem limiting, I think there are enough options for the Overlord player to mix it up if you replay a scenario.

If you're looking to scratch a dungeon crawl itch, you could do a lot worse.

Takes Level 7 to the minis level with a self contained, new game.  If you like games like Space Hulk, you'll like this one where both sides will have just as much fun playing the scenarios, and have just as much to do rather than one side just feeding more fodder into the mix in an attempt to overwhelm the opponent.

Game is mechanically sound and has good components. Unfortunately as the game requires tight tactical thinking for the characters to survive, this suffers from dominating personalities. Now that we have Imperial Assault, it might be really hard to get this to the table.

Omg this is such a slow moving game. -edit- I've recently realized someone we play with is the slowest moving player of all time. Every game you play with them will take 4 times longer. This has coloured my play of this game. Cause he ruined it for me.

Excellent mechanics in a game ruined by terrible miniatures sub par components. Not as  good as Gears of War , Galaxy Defenders or Imperial assault.  Average dungeon crawl In dire need of an upgrade/Re-release. 6/10 for now.

DRIPPING with theme.  Would be rated higher if it wasn't so fiddly with a long setup time.

It seems like a great co-op vs. bad guy game.

Ohh and the theme - love it. Think it captures the Aliens theme "Game over man, game over"...

Update aug. 2014
I've only played it a couple of times, but what a game.
Descent second edition is great, but this fires on all cylinders - love sci-fi so wupi :)
Descent has it beaten in one department (and a pretty important one) - expansions. The replay ability of Omega 7 is good, but no way near Descent. To bad Privateer Press aren't making an expansion.

And the expansion came :D

What a sleeper hit, and unexpected favorite in my collection, for someone who doesn't even like dungeon crawling!  This game came out of nowhere and blew me away with it's give-and-take adrenaline mechanic, wealth of player upgrades, campaign based narrative, and innovative room cards design.  Please, oh please, release an expansion!  And how about a freaking solo variant!? 

What I really don't care for are the shoddy miniatures I cannot for-the-life-of-me get to stand upgright, even after multiple dips in boiling water. :angry:
Replaced all the alien minis with Gears of War minis for an easy pimp.

LOS rules are also a bit wonky and rather cumbersome.  We keep having to revisit LOS rules with every occassional game.

RATING: 7
It's a good game.  My 7 rating is more related to the quality of the minis and map tiles, as well as the existance of what seem to be superior games with nearly identical gameplay.  The theme reminds me very much of X-Com game with commandos fighting aliens.  Love the one against many play format and how the power of the alien overlord player scales to the number of commandos he/she plays against by feeding off of their fear, or "adrenaline points" as the game calls it, and using those points to bring more aliens into the mix.  Quality of minis is a let down and the map tiles should interlock.  Maybe check out Imperial Assault instead?

RATING: 7.4
There's some really good tactical decisions in this game and it especially shines as a 3+ player game where there is communication happening between the commandos. I have always been the overlord in this game so I can only really assess it from one perspective. This game had it's time but has been eclipsed by Star Wars: Imperial Assault.

The game has some neat mechanics such as how the more adrenaline the commandos use, the more actions the overseer can take.  It is also interesting how the overseer actions deplete and replenish.  I also like how the commando's stance affects their movement and combat.

However, I found most of the Overseer's actions pretty dull.  The clones are also dull and many of them are so pitifully weak, you waste a lot of time rolling their attacks for very little damage and masses of them just get slaughtered each turn.  The missions I have played so far have also been boring.

The rulebook leaves a lot to be desired with many concepts unclear or hidden.  The minis tend to bend over a lot versus stand up straight.

As such, this game is not living up to its potential.

A fun game, has a few issues with LOS sometimes being wonky for ranged attacks but it's overall still enjoyable.  This is easily my favorite of the Level 7 series.

Great Dungeon crawler. No gear or character progression, but very good tactical options with a system of tactical stances. Good diversity of character roles to choose from. 
Overseer is very fun to play since you have meaningful decisions to make, so it's not as boring as in for example Descent series. Game uses the Stronghold system. 
LOS system is not as intuitive as could be.

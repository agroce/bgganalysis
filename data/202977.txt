Kind of meh (just a run of the mill worker placement game) but it's fairly fast so might get a few more plays. Fear that all it has is "a few more games" though which leads back to "meh".

After a single play, I can say that this is a solid game. Not "solid for an educational game", but actually solid. 
The theme is subtle, but well researched and could easily be used to supplement a classroom.

The mechanics are simple enough that you could teach a non-gamer in about ten minutes or less, and the flow is just right for introducing the worker-placement mechanic. I do feel that avid gamers, especially euro-gamers, would find it a bit simple though. Overall I would recommend this as a light-weight worker-placement game.

Looks nice with vibrant colours and cool bits. Not overly complicated (didn’t play with the virus expansion yet) unless you want to AP yourself to death. Short gamelength (I’m not entirely sure if it is a tad too short or just about the right length yet) but not to the point of becoming a problem.

I played the KS version. It has beautiful art and components. The game had a unique theme and the worker placement decisions were incorporated well. I felt like there was too much random luck when playing with the Viruses along with the cards that would show up off the top of the deck. A very good learning game based on the theme but as worker placements go, nothing really special.

This resource-claim / placement game plays very similarly to Lords of Waterdeep, so if you are familiar with the genre it is easy to pick up. In addition, the game really gives you a feel for all the activity in the cell. You don’t have to learn cell biology to play, but you might pick up a bit anyway - and if you want to learn, there is even a booklet with a brief explanation of the organelles and their roles in the cell.

Just got our collector's edition last week from the Kickstarter campaign.  

We are very impressed.  It's not the deepest/most complex worker placement game, but I consider that a strength as opposed to most people knocking it for that.  We love worker placement games, but sometimes just don't want to commit to one with a million moving parts.  This one simplifies things in to a much simpler, more streamlined experience that works beautifully.

No revolutionary mechanics but well integrated theme and solid execution of common mechanics. Not a huge fan of 1st player being something a player selects and then it goes clockwise (too big of a benefit starting left of the starting player) so recommend modding it so that you use e.g. the extra flasks to indicate the turn order and when someone selects the 1st player action they simply slide their color to the front, pushing everyone else back one step in turn order.

I've only played two-player so far, and this game felt like a race. Every action optimised to try and score the maximum number of points over the course of the game. I enjoyed it, and am looking forward to playing again.

Update - played again with 3 and thoroughly enjoyed it. I wonder if the Enzyme cards are a little powerful, or whether players just need to know that if they allow someone to focus on them it can draw a large score. Nonetheless - I really enjoyed my second play with three. Tense and interesting.

While I can see why some people might like this (the people I played with enjoyed it a lot more than I did), it's just too light for my taste. It's almost an oversimplified worker placement game. 
I love Lords of Waterdeep and Stone Age as "gateway worker placement games", but Cytosis is probably even more basic, so if you have kids or play with non-gamers, it will probably go over well. 

The theme is probably realistic (from what I could tell it made sense, but I'm not a biology student), but truthfully, we almost always just referred to the ressources by their colors and not their actual names (lipids, carbs etc.)...

There isn't that much player interaction other than the occasional blocking, but even that isn't so bad as there are lots of useful spaces. And even if you get blocked, you can always pay some ATP to place an extra worker on that space! So it's quite forgiving. 

The card collecting is always fun, I especially like the enzymes, but there are actually only 2 of each in the entire game, and as all cards probably won't show up, it's a bit of a risk (I started pursuing enzymes and had 2 after 2 rounds, but never got more; and the other player who did get some enzymes could then complete them undisputed as he could always place a worker on the enzymes spot which we couldn't block...)
Speaking of blocking, I think the overall goal cards could be implemented in a better way. I'm always a sucker for unique scoring abilities, but the way it is done in this game makes people sort of "specialize" in certain cards which discourages competition for other cards, especially if the other players also get +2 points if they had already made such a card...

The pace of the game was good; the game moves quickly, and our 3 player game probably took around 45 minutes, so it's faster than LoW. But on the other hand, there wasn't any real sense of progress; round 10 was almost exactly like round 5... And all of us ended with a ton of resources left which we couldn't use as there isn't that many ways to grab a card, so they were kind of wasted. Of course this might help with additional plays.

Overall this game is a bit too simplistic for my taste, but as I said I can see why other people like it, so you might want to check it out.

Solid score the most points worker placement game where, like its predecessors, player interaction is limited to taking cards/spots before other players and piggy backing on point scoring. What shines is the cool theme and pieces. The game is easy to play but takes more work to learn than it should due to the layout/sequencing of the rulebook. Rating may change with more plays and incorporation of the expansion/optional rules.  Collector's Edition #3893

The theme is the uniqueness of this game--very few games broach a science subject in the way this game does.  On the the kickstarter version even the the wooden tokens are printed with molecular formulas.  As far the the game play goes, reminds me of many other games with elementary worker placement, option to go first, fulfill card requirements for Victory pts, events, etc.  The subject matter & the way it is game incorporated is the only reason to buy this game.

Super attractive game that can be used for educating a wide range of people about cell biology!  The beginning of the game is a bit aimless, the game as a whole needs some conflict arc, and the overall objective should be something more thematic than to just collect Health Points.  As others have said, rather similar to Lords of Waterdeep and set collection games like Sushi Go.  Putting stuff on transport discs is fun.  Could use more tension or disruption from the player's "collection" of stuff they have, whether it's an exchange/discarding of component cards or something else.  Also could use more immersion.  Haven't played enough times yet, but it also seems that rewarding +3 points for being the first to a goal card is too much, potentially too much advantage for those with early initial turn order.

Our family likes this one a little better than Lords of Waterdeep, but maybe not quite as much as Manhattan Project.

The worker placement aspect is really tight, making for a very fun game that is surprisingly accurate (as far as it goes) on the cell biology.   The accurate biology is great for teachers and those who love cell biology.  But you don't really need to know the biology to enjoy the game, or to understand the gameplay.  

One of the best educational games I have played.  If you can find a copy of the deluxe Kickstarter edition for a decent price - grab it!  The upgraded components are superb!

As a science teacher, this game is great. It's fairly long and fairly advanced, so nothing that you can just whip out in class. But the students really enjoyed it and are excited to have it available to play in their free time.

The content is extremely accurate and fairly straightforward once you play through it once or twice. While being a standard worker placement game, the educational topic really makes it shine. Only complaints are the length (a little too long) and the narrow pathways to victory. The addition of the virus expansion and the epigenetic mutation expansion make for some fun gameplay, but I would have loved to see the double sided board use one side as an animal cell and the other as a plant cell with a little more placements (photosynthesis, cell walls, central vacuoles) or even just a little more thrown in there like transcription/translation or osmosis.

As a biochemist, I can tell that cytosis represents a really good tool to introduce people to cell biology and to the central dogma of genetics. The artwork is just stunning and the materials used for every component (at least for the Kickstarter edition) are of the best quality one would expect. 
As a game, you'll enjoy it if you enjoy worker-placement mechanics. That's what most of the game is about. 
The companion booklet explains all the biological concepts underlying the game in a lay way that most people should easily understand. This is especially useful if trying to explain those concepts to children or non-specialists.
Cytosis is a great game overall and I really enjoy playing it :)

Very light worker placement type of game. You're basically fulfilling jobs by providing cubes through a production chain. This game doesn't introduce any unique mechanics but it does make you want to learn a little about biology.

Good, solid light to medium-weight worker placement game.  Looks like there are multiple paths to victory, although it seems getting those Receptors early can be really good as you can score points from other player's actions or perhaps deter them, which could be even better.  Getting goal cards early is also highly desirable.  Definitely prefer playing with the virus attacks, haven't tried it with the special powers yet.

Kickstarted.  Great worker placement game very thematic, may take players a bit to see that to score points requires 3 actions chained up, and required to be played adding proteins and lipids to the player disc, and not from supply as well as  possibly over multiple turns from ER, Golgi, to scoring.

Components are SPECTACULAR.   Science and learning into a very playable and very fun worker placement.  The science is not a gimmick it legitimately works for the theme of the game. 

2 players plays as well as 3 players, would never play this with 5.  Based on seeing how it plays with 2 and 3.

It's pretty good. The mechanics/rules are medium-light, with additional complexity added due to the theme. While you don't need to know anything about the theme, it does actually help. It's not ground breaking, and if you already own other worker placement games, you won't be getting anything new other than the milieu. I like it, I'm glad to have it, it is still accessible to new players, and there is still a good amount of strategic decisions with just enough player interaction to not be totally multi-player solitaire, which I really appreciate in games.

Cytosis would be EXCELLENT in a classroom as an educational tool but also just as good on any gamer's tabletop. It's simple enough to be considered a gateway game to the worker placement mechanism yet play can be extremely strategic as you must think logically and plan ahead to do well. Graphics are top notch. Highly recommended!

It's a bit of a steep uphill climb to get started due to all the cell biology terminology, but once things are going, the game becomes very fast and straightforward.

Surprisingly a lot of fun.  Looks like it is going to be flat-out 'educational' - which usually means 'education' before 'game' - but is actually a lot of fun to play.  The science-y parts of it make it a bit harder to teach, and the iconography and presentation could have been a bit clearer, but once you get going it flows.  We have not played the viruses yet, but are looking forward to trying that out.  For those wondering if this might be a good gift for the biologist in your life, I would make sure that there is a 'gamer' at the table for the first couple of plays while they get the worker-placement system under their belt.

Reasonable game, a little too light to be as long as it was. Didn't feel like there was any real blocking or stress of worker placement.

Theme is carried well throughout the game (I assume, as I have no idea of the science behind it!)

A simple, straightforward worker placement game that does nothing new whatsoever. That doesn't bother me - I love simple worker placement games. The theme on this one though ... just about kills it. I'm sure I'm biased due to my total lack of cell -inner-workings knowledge, but the terms used to name cards, board spaces, and resources are all horrendously long and the terminology is all so specialized. It's great for a science class learning the subject, but for the rest of us ... I'd honestly prefer this game if the resources were simply called "red cubes", "green cubes" and so on. Maybe a simple factory theme, with a couple of conveyor belts down the middle? A toy factory?

I also dislike the clunky, oddly shaped bits from the deluxe kickstarter edition. Give me simple, coloured cubes.

Cytosis is a really well-designed hard science game.  The worker placement works extremely well for doing resource collection and hormone synthesis.  Imagine Lords of Waterdeep, with a real connection to theme.  (A heaping mound of science theme)

You have a great mix of mechanisms in Cytosis as well.  I love how building hormone receptors early in the game can really pay off as you benefit from other players building matching hormones.  The set collection on the enzymes can really be powerful if you build up a nice big set.  The grey workers let you pay up to reuse an occupied spot, and even better, you get to place a second worker on that turn, which feels great!    Possession of the first player marker is tied to a really nice end-game bonus mechanism where players claim spots on bonus cards at some point through the game; Claiming bonus spots early get you bonus points, but you might also tip your hand, or the rest of the game may not line up with your early strategy.

I also played with the Virus expansion, which worked out pretty well.  You really want to be the one who initiates a Viral attack, because it lets you build up antibodies before the virus hits.  Plus, building up anti-bodies can be a very efficient way to score end-game points, if the right bonus cards are out there.

I REALLY want to try the variable player powers expansion.  All of them sounded pretty phenomenal, and I want to try them all.  Great game!

I could say: typical Kickstarter. For me that's something negative, but maybe it's not so bad. It all works fine, but it's a bit flat, it misses some salt and pepper, and the them can't save that . The theme is original I must say, but in the end you're simply collecting black or green cubes because you have a task that gives you points for delivering those black and green cubes. It's for me all a bit 'been there, done that'. 

I haven't tried the Virus expansion yet, that seems to be adding a bit more body to the game, but it also adds a take-that factor that Americans love, but being a European, I hate, so I have doubts if that would reserve my issues with this game.

I will give this game the benefit of the doubt. We played incorrectly by adding 3 extra rounds, by mistake. My play through was less than exciting. Simple resource conversion game with nothing interesting happening. The theme doesn't do it for me either. Nothing wrong about the game and it is mechanically fine. Overall just not for me to keep me interested.

This game has gone over well with everyone we've played it with.  It's a fairly simple worker placement game that has you going through the actual processes the body uses to create certain molecules.  It works well.

I have a few minor criticisms.  First, our game group doesn't particularly enjoy the virus expansion as we don't like player interaction.  Also, I don't think it's worth playing as a 2 player game.  I haven't yet tried it with 3 players - I suspect it's ok.  It plays well with 4.  Lastly, we have the deluxe version of the game and there simply isn't enough of some of the components.  We're constantly running out.  We've simply added a "x5" marker that can be used when needed.

Decent board game, though not great. Essentially a simple worker placement and resource management game. However, the theme and biological accuracy really make this a special game that we enjoy returning to. Also, the artwork is fabulous. Overall, a fun game for biology and science enthusiasts.

Solid, beats out lords of waterdeep and all the other light-medium strategy euros for me. the theme is awesome, players learn about cell biology, AND has a solid gameplay. 

its probably lighter rules-wise than lords of waterdeep but i think the strategies could be deeper actually. 'tis definitely a sleeper hit for me.

Backed on Kickstarter Premium Collector's Edition Pledge (April 2017). Expected delivery August 2017. Arrived 10/28/17. As a scientist with degrees in Biology and Organic Geochemistry coupled with 25+ years experience in Genomics and a love of work placement games this game couldn't be more in my wheelhouse! The art is fantastic, components are exceptional and the science is quite accurate.

Cell-formation game; has a strong educational element with work-placement mechanics.  We played our first game 5-player.  Two players quickly picked up a strategy of hording the blacks and yellow cubes which effectively shut down card completion for everyone else (not fun).  There were 3 cards towards the end of the Event deck that forced these players to return a couple of these cubes to the resource piles, but they were quickly taken by the first player in the next round.  Finally when there were enough cubes (black/yellow) to begin the cell construction process, there weren't enough turns remaining to do much of anything.  Most turns were wasted doing actions I did not want to do.  Solution, either add more cubes so there isn't a shortage, or make the hording penalty cards more painful. The cut-throat, in-your-face game play effectively destroys the fun, family-oriented game that I thought this would be.  House-ruling is in order.

Medium-Light worker placement game that requires multiple steps to turn worker actions into victory points. Some light player conflict in terms of scoring majorities, and I'm looking forward to adding in variable player powers. At a higher player count, the board becomes significantly tighter, and it is much harder to achieve enzyme synthesis or alcohol detoxifying with only one source available for all players.  It makes me wish the board scaled for players, rather than the number of beakers

There's a really good WP game in here somewhere, but right now it's just a little above average.  First, if you've played Lords of Waterdeep, this game will feel very similar in many respects - place worker, take resourses.  Place worker, get "quest".  Place worker, take card that impacts other players (Intrigue).  Definitely, less tension with lower player count.  Game moves fairly smoothly and in about an hour once everyone gets the scientific terminology out of the way or just refers to everything by color, lol.  And there's some good synergy between cards that get played/worked out of your hand and goal cards.  That said there are a few shortcomings with the game.  First the player powers are unbalanced and in some cases quit useless.  Second, the grey flasks which provide extra actions are essentially are never worth it except for the last round.  The cost is more than the return you can get for an additional action.   The Virus expansion adds an additional element that provides direct player to player interaction, which is not always present in a Euro.  Definitely worth adding in the game.  Decent entry-level euro, but I'd probably play Lords of Waterdeep instead if I had the choice.

I've played this once so far with some fellow Biologists and we all really enjoyed both the Biology lesson and the underlying worker placement game (despite one of us feeling pretty tired before the game started). The final scores were all within a point of each other despite having taken different approaches to winning. It feels like all the options are well balanced and there are multiple valid paths to victory.

I've got the kickstarter edition and the box, artwork and components are amazing! The attention to detail at every level is remarkable.

It feels like a much more interesting game than Lords of Waterdeep. In particular, having to move partially completed vesicles through different organelles before scoring adds some tension an interesting extra layer of planning to the game. A superb combination of theme and game. Looking forward to trying the virus expansion next time.

I think anyone who likes light worker placement games would really enjoy this whether they find the science interesting or not, however if you're interested in cell biology this is a must-play!

I wondered if this game might be a little too simple after getting the KS deluxe edition, but the first play was surprisingly smooth and enjoyable. A close game between three players, and there was some good tension in some of the later choices. Do you keep piling on missions with bonuses for you and others, or do you pivot and grab missions that don't interact with others? End-game scoring and event cards added some nice wrinkles too.

Overall, I was a big fan of the production and the ease in which the game played. Good stuff.

** A second game with two players proved equally interesting, with the spread being two points at the end. **

12-year-olds ate it up — in fact, pleaded to play it when it arrived, which is an unprecedented event. The mechanisms are simple enough to let you savor the scientific concepts, and appreciate how they were mapped to the game. We had a good time, and enjoyed competing for opportunities and resources! …even if one of the 12-year-olds was fantasizing about a mitosis and/or meiosis expansion….

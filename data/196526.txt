Great fast playing solo game. It provides many ways to tune the difficulty and incorporates mechanisms that increase its variability between plays. As a light, quick solo game, this will get compared to Friday. Coffee Roaster feels less deterministic than Friday, so this wins on longevity. Friday's puzzle is more engaging, especially up to the point when Friday's process clicks. If you are looking for a light, quick solo game, I would suggest buying Friday over this due to the price points. However, Coffee Roaster provides a great complement to Friday and will likely see more table time than Friday in the long term. Ignoring price, I like this game more than Friday. Coffee Roaster is a well designed game and a well thought out production.

I bought Coffee Roaster last autumn, and it became my introduction to solo gaming (except for normal solitaire using playing cards).

First off, this game is gorgeous! It is a pool building game in which you draw tokens from a bag. The goal of the game is to roast high quality coffee beans by manipulating the contents of the bag and achieving a high score.

I am one point away from the top level of "Meister" (60+ points), so this game won't be leaving my table anytime soon. Will stay in my collection for sure!

Pros:
- Very pleasant visuals
- Excellent component quality!
- Relaxing pace
- Nice theme

Cons (depending on your circumstances):
- Expensive and hard to find
- A relatively big box for a solitaire only game

Wow, this was really fun! A solitaire bag manipulation game which is basically a big puzzle to solve with randomness. Draw a certain number of tokens from a bag each turn and try to manipulate the numbered tokens into higher numbers (but no too high) and eliminate bad tokens (burnt beans, etc.). Each coffee card gives you a target number for the "cup test" at the end of the game. Draw 10 tokens one at a time and try to get in that range for VP's. I played the full game (3 blends) and scored a measly 7 points total. I didn't score any brew points for any of my 3 coffees. But, I can see what to do next time. This is super fun and is easily a Top 100 game for me.

I really liked the idea of this game after I heard about it from Zee Garcia from the Dice Tower. It was on my wishlist to get from Japan. When the designer e-mailed me that the game was back in stock (after I had already forgotten that I inquired about the game) I decided to get it.

At first, I thought it would be a good solo game for a trip, but it's a little too big for that.

The components are nice, and the gameplay is relatively straightforward.

The game is rather difficult, though, so I think I'll get a lot of play out of it. Some other solo games (or variants) that I've played were far too easy, and they got stale rather quickly.

With the different types of beans, it feels like there's enough variety to keep the game interesting.

Update May 2017: Upped this to a 10. So enjoyable, and smooth as butter. A classic in its genre.

Wonderful chit pulling and manipulation solitaire game, with a strong theme. Everything that was good about Orleans, without the bloat, is here, in full glory. There are enough means to manipulate the chits to attain the recipes you are working towards, but luck is always present. And why shouldn't it be? This is a 1h game that is mostly tactical in nature, where you react to the whims of the draw. The theme is exquisitely married to the mechanisms, to the point where it brings a grin to my face when I read the flavor text for each coffee bean. A very interesting design with lots of legs, that should be in every solo gamer's collection. 

+ wonderful and strong theme, tightly entwined with the various mechanisms
+ quick to play, and not fiddly at all
+ awesome components, art and insert, especially the insert is world class
+ full of tension and with very interesting and non-obvious decisions

= the luck of the draw is ever present, but is usually possible to mitigate
= mostly tactical, with strategic broad lines

Coffee Roaster is amazing. Its pieces come together to offer a quick single-player experience that rewards skill and requires just the right amount of luck, which is more than can be said for many co-ops out there (which admittedly sometimes are just solo games).

One of the few purely solo games I have played. I like solo games and I like bag-building and this games combines the both. It is not quite as much bag-building as it is a bag manipulation game. Like most solo games it is a big puzzle.

And it is a very good puzzle. I feel like I am just scratching the surface of this game. I want to get to know it better and I want get better at it.

RATING: 8
It does move quickly, and the difference between beans is large enough so far (just using Beginner beans) that it has been an interesting solo experience.

For a solitaire-only design, this has the legs to be one of the better ones, although I'm not quite sure it's better than Nemo's War, Cruel Necessity, or Navajo Wars quite yet.

RATING: 8
In Coffee Roaster you are, well, a coffee roaster looking to hit a target roast value while also hitting on certain target flavor profiles. You begin each game picking a type of bean to roast. Beans are divided into three types of roasts (light, medium, dark) and up to three difficulty levels (beginner, advanced, expert). A full game consists of roasting one bean of each type, picking difficulty levels of your choosing. You initially add to your roasting bag (in the form of tokens) a mix of unroasted beans and hard beans difficult to roast along with moisture, numerous flavor profiles and maybe some bad beans that will never roast. The game consists of drawing tokens out of the bag, increasing the number drawn by one each turn, in hopes of removing moisture, reducing the flavor profiles to the right mix, removing bad or over-roasted beans, and then increasing each bean one level (aka roasting) before returning them to your bag. Beans can roast up to level 4 before burning. Each type of bean has a roasting # target (like 14 or 20) and a mix of flavor profiles (body, aroma, acidity, and sweetness) that are ideal. After you think you've got the right mix of tokens in your bag, you perform the "cup test" and draw 10 tokens one by one and see how close you can get to your targets. There are ways you can influence your cup test in order to set aside some unwanted tokens, redraw or add a pre-set bean or flavor. Keep in mind as well that this is not a game that you "win", it is a beat your previous score sort of solo game, which I know does not appeal to everyone.

The game is lovingly produced by publisher/designer Saashi & Saashi, from the charming art to the well-planned insert to the relatively clear rule book (especially for a Japanese game). The fine production may be influencing my score upward a point, but why shouldn't it? The game has a high price point and I'm not quite willing to say that it is worth the going rate, but it is a charming and engaging package to be sure.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A charming game with a great theme. Despite the light flavor, it is always so easy to control the pace of the beans roasting, while simultaneously worrying about the flavors so you can get a good pull for the cup test. There is of course luck in the game, but it tends to be not a huge factor (if you play correctly and thing your bag appropriately)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Smooth playing solitaire game, a distinguishing feature in a genre that tends to bury gameplay in procedures and tables. Decisions are interesting: Do I use a flavor token now or hope for a better effect later? Do I save it for the cup test? Which effect helps the blend best? Do I push my luck and dare another coffee roast with the risk of ruining the beans?

I'm not sure how deep it is as I already reached the second highest roaster level on my second try and first try with correct rules but I might have gotten lucky. However, for a thirty minute game I don't complain.

Rating based on SOLO play only.

One of the issues I have with solo games is that I usually end up feeling that that there is little upside to playing it in board form when digital games are so much easier (no setup, no shuffling, etc.); however, Coffee Roaster has a physical pleasure to it that can't be replicated. The components are all great quality, from the sturdy player boards down to the terrific insert, and I can feel the love that went into it. The game itself is incredibly charming and yes, rather thematic, and I enjoy the BINGO feeling of pulling chits out of the bag. There is a lot of luck, but there are ways to bend it to your favour (and I am incredibly bad at it!). Early rating, but this is my favourite solo game so far.

RATING: 7.5
This game is all about mitigating luck of the draw. That is, all of the choices that you make come to fruition by drawing chits from a bag. I like it. Quality components, thematic integration and 10 minute play time come together to make a solid filler.

I really never play solo games. Total impulse buy at Essen 2016. I must say I am loving this game. It is a bag builder. I like deckbuilding, so this gave me the same feeling. The components are really good. The artwork is fine for me. The gameplay is great. There is a luck factor, but there are a lot of actions that counter this. It is a game about timing, when to use the actions, when to do the cup test. It is pretty challeging to do well in this game. The challenge of beating my own score keeps me coming back. I highly recommend this one!

What makes Coffee Roaster such a great solo game is that you can knock out a game in 5-10 minutes, and immediately want to play again. It has a very addictive feel with how you're trying to beat your previous score on each blend that you attempt. And while the rules are pretty rough to get through, and the luck factor can feel a little heavy-handed, Coffee Roaster is one of the very best solo games out there.

This game presents an interesting and challenging puzzle; it keeps you engaged throughout the entire experience without stringing you along on a pre-determined path... exactly what I want in a solo game. 
Bag-building puts a new spin on the now classic deck-building mechanic, and it allows you to "feel" the probabilities instead of abstracting them. 
Throughout the game you are given lots of choices, which will reward or punish you in a very thematic way. Excellent blend of mechanics and theming.

[b]Coffee Roaster[/b] was sold via the marketplace 4/10/17.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]I had this on my wishlist for a while and finally decided to get a copy when it popped up on the marketplace. I am intrigued by the idea of bag building games, but have yet to find one I really enjoy [i](Orleans has come the closest)[/i]. I've been playing a few more solo games of late, I love coffee so I thought this would be a great game to play. 

Unfortunately the whole game boils down to mitigating the luck of the draw with a few, standard special powers you may or may not be able to activate. There is a bit more to the game play, but not much. I didn't feel like the choices I made were that tough, Coffee Roaster plays more like a push your luck game which is not what I was looking for. The challenge will come more from the randomness of the bag draw than any of the decisions you are asked to make. By no means a bad game, but it is much lighter than I expected.[/i]

RATING: 8
This could go either way. Enjoyed my first few plays, it just depends on how much the game will evolve. Sometimes it feels you have too few options. (with the easier beans) However the more advanced beans come with more flavour tokens, which means more choices. I could see me wanting an expansion down the line.. Cause it would drastically increase re-playability.

SOLO ONLY- I don't often play solo and when I do I play Arle. Arle is more of a time suck though and this one plays really quickly (or longer for a longer game). It is push your luck with a planning aspect so you can really (hopefully) get the result you are looking for in the final pull of the round. Lots of interesting choices and having a good memory definitely helps. Very enjoyable and any solo gamer would and should look up this title. Well deserved spot in the collection and I plan to enjoy many more plays of this for the nights I am alone. If only I enjoyed coffee, I would drink it with every play!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A very, very nice solo only game. It comes with an excellent insert for the box that effectively prevents the game from becoming very fiddly.
A full game sees you roasting three different types of coffee beans, divided into three groups and three different levels. The next level of bean you roast is determined by the your current score.
The game play is quite simple. The coffee bean card shows you which tokens (regular unroasted beans, hard beans, bad beans, moisture, different flavour elements) to put into the bag. You then pull a certain number of tokens out of the bag on your turn. The flavour elements can be used for special effects, while the bean tokens will be replaced by tokens for beans that have been roasted more - or roasted too much and gotten burned.
At the end you do a cup test by pulling one token at a time and decide whether to put it into the final cup or on a small discard tray.

It is surprisingly addictive. I didn't think I liked push your luck games, but I really love this one. It is also very nice that it is so fast to set up and a play through of even the full game probably doesn't take more than 20-30 minutes. Oh, and the components are really nice!

This is a light solitaire game about roasting coffee beans.  In my limited play experience, it's fun.  I don't think it'll hold up long term as I think once you learn enough you'll get to a point your always playing optimal strategy, but your choices will be kind of obvious.  Maybe I'm wrong.  In any case, I could see 30 or 40 plays before you get to that point with the number of beans and the three rounds you have to play.

Decent fun -- and there's definite skill needed in the flicking. I almost want the game to include a more complex mode (without the card draw), since the game (1 round for each player) pales in comparison to the skill curve of the flicking. For its level of simplicity in game play, we want to play Junk Art or Rhino Hero: Superbattle more.

It's just silly fun. The box-in-a-box systems works really well. I wish there were ways to change up the layout but that's a minor quibble. This is a fun option when you just want to flick some penguins around and see what happens. Having a minimal amount of skill is useful but not entirely necessary. The moments when you go through two doorways at once or successfully jump your penguin across the board are so satisfying.

Ice Cool is a dexterity game where you flick weeble-wobble-like penguins between rooms. You're either trying to pass through certain doors to collect fish or catch the other penguins who are trying to collect fish. It's cute and you can see some neat shots in the game. The storage of the separate boxes that make up the board is pretty neat. However, the game part is just not that much. It's fun enough to try and I'd play it again... but I don't feel like I have to.

Ice cool is a dexterity game where you are flicking weeble-wobble style penguins in an attempt to collect fish and avoid the hall monitor. The penguins work well, and you can even flick them on the side to get some spin moves or flick hard on the head to make them jump. 

Works well for kids and adults alike, and tends to be balanced when playing with different ages. Very fun and simple. One of my go to dexterity games.

A game typically catered for kids, but as an adult I had quite some fun too. You have a wobbly spinning top-like penguin that you finger-flick through door openings in order to score. One of the other player's goal is to hunt the other penguins. It's not meant to be taken too seriously. It's all about moving around the table and having simple fun.

Scoring a goal doesn't get you points directly, but gains you a card with a value of 1 to 3. This means end game scoring can be pretty luck dependent.

Kids will probably rate this game higher. ;)

School is almost out in Antarctica but a few of the penguins are too hungry to wait!  They skip out on class and, racing through the hallways, make their way to the cafeteria to grab an afternoon snack.  Will they make it before being caught by the dreaded hall monitor?  Welcome to “Ice Cool”.

“Ice Cool” is a surprisingly fun and innovative “flicking” game for 2-4 players published by Brain Games.  The gameplay is fast and intuitive.  Although it’s geared to younger players, I’ve played the game with several different age groups, including a mixed session, and the result is always the same, LOTS OF FUN!

A really cute game with the whole play in the box innovation, but I found the "fun" wore off quickly, and the game felt really same-y from game to game since the box layout is always the same. It quickly felt like there was an optimal path to take, which really made it to where it didn't feel like there were any interesting decisions, at which point it just boiled down to flicking skill.

Cute, fun, and unique though, and I can see it working very well for families.

RATING: 7
I rarely play dexterity game but I actually had a lot of fun playing Ice Cool. Players try to flick their penguins through doorways while the hall monitor tris to catch them. The game recently won the Kinderspiel award and it's definitely just as amusing for adults. I wish the game could have come with a couple of different configurations to add some variety in setup since the game rewards multiple plays to practice your flicking moves. Would definitely play this game again!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Enjoyable flicking game that works for a wide variety of ages. The game is straightforward and easy to grok, yet the weeble-wobble penguins benefit from skilled play. 

Visually, this game is a treat and that's the main selling point. It's not the deepest of dexterity games but it's certainly fun and a great experience.

This is yet a dexterity games, and I'm generally not a fan of these kind of games, although I love Pitchcar and generally likes speed (not dexterity) games. However, this one differs dramatically from the usual dex games, as those are mostly won and lost due to the skills of the players as luck isn't involved... Because in this game, while you generally have an advantage if you're much better than the other players, you still draw randomly point cards from a deck of cards! This is a terrible design choice, and it detracts a lot for me! Sure, it means everybody can win, but it's just so random that it's not any fun... And yes, the rules does state that if you draw two 1 point cards, you can take an extra turn, but it's still much better to draw two 3 point cards... Of course, if one player is much better than the rest, he will end the game quickly and have the upper hand, but it's rare that one player is much better than the rest, and generally I would suspect that randomness decides the outcome of the game due to the card draws. 

The game itself is okay. Not that interesting, but you do get better as times goes by, and you can even jump over walls, which is quite neat. The track itself is of course brilliantly done as it uses the game box itself, but it lacks variety i.e. other ways to create the course/track. Also, I think the walls obstruct when you take a lot of your shots; you cannot really get in a position with your fingers to flick your penguin well. So, all things considered, I have passed this game on and will just stick to Pitchcar.

Dexterity game about flicking penguins through corridors. The setup is really nice, with  the many inserts creating the board.  The gameplay itself seemed dull and random, mainly because the scoring is drawing a random card. Fine for a kids game to get a few laughs but nothing else here.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A decent dexterity game that uses weighted penguin pawns so you never quite know how they will flick. As the runner you try to flick your pawn through various rooms to collect your fish all while avoiding the catcher who tries to tag you. The fish are always in the same place so I feel like the flicking challenge will be the same from game to game and a little more random fish locations would be better. Another downside is it definitely needs as many players as possible for it to work well I think. It is too easy for the catcher to target the 1 person in a 2-player game and even though they have to get caught twice, one good shot can make it go either way almost too easily. 

A bit of a miss for me, but by 5-year old seemed to enjoy it so it will likely stick around to play with her when she feels in the mood.

Had a chance to play this with 4 and it was a lot more fun and is a decent dexterity game for a bunch of adults to have fun with.

Fun time waster, and possibly a good game for kids. Lovely art and a great overall idea that works well with the components. One however cannot fail to notice the laziness of the scoring mechanism which is highly random and might as well not be there. Were it not for the fun flicking components and art, this would get a 3, however it is a quick game and fun if played with the right audience.

While innovative, the component quality in this game is very poor.  Even though the boxes clip together well, they still feel like flimsy cardboard and just look cheap.  The plastic penguins are probably designed/weighted correctly, but they are of a single molded piece and just look & feel low quality.  So glad I "played with this" at a convention and didn't spend any money on it.  No game.  No value.

Ice Cool is a current family favorite (with girls 12 and 13 yo). Early in our plays, it was the accidental amazing shot that tantalized us to improve our skills. Now, we're all pretty good, doing stuff like jumping a wall then scooting through a door. We like Pitch Car, but there are more trick shots you can do with Ice Cool - more amazing moments.

It's the closest thing to a pool table I'll ever get into my house.

RATING: 5
This game falls into the category of [Would not be worth owning for lack of replayability depth, but amusing to play once if given the chance]. Like all good dexterity games, it is not overly complicated and lets you focus on the laughs, jeers, and fun of waiting for your turn.

Props on the great bit quality and clever use of the "Nesting Doll" game board.

I feel slightly bad giving this a 5.5, because there are some good things going on here.  Most importantly for me, is the ability to play this game across ages.  I had initially bought it so I could play with my niece and nephew, who are 9 and 4.  I think they would certainly rank this game higher.  It was fun to play, but the random point cards you earn failed in my experience.

The box as play area is brilliant.

Was quite torn between keeping it because of the unique aspects and getting rid because of the lacklustre gameplay (fun enough but there's just not that much to do in the game), but when it comes down to it I prioritise good gameplay over aesthetics and had to let it go. 
As a game collector :thumbsup: as a game [i]player[/i] :thumbsdown:

Ice Cool has beautiful production and really nice components, the box-in-a-box is a really cool idea, the game is easy to set up, takes little table space and is very quick and fun to play. I like the idea that you can use 2 '1' cards to take an extra turn flicking but not lose your cards for end game scoring. Plays well with 2 as you each get 2 rounds. However, despite the excellent production I'm not a fan of white boxes especially when they are uncoated, and the box is larger than I would like for our shelves. The gameplay I could take it or leave it – random spin effects when you mean to curve or jump and it can take time and practice to get good. Thing is...I'm not that interested in getting [i]that[/i] good.

It's fine but probably not the best with only 2 players, probably better with little kids, and despite the fact that I've owned it since the middle of last year and it is so quick to setup and play, I find that we've only played it a few times because I have to be in the right mood to play it, and I 'm not interested in a second game when the first is over.

Acquired at Fanfare in Kalamazoo coming back from Milwaukee trip 2017.  Fun dexterity game.  Love the box in a box setup.  Great components, although I wonder about the longevity of the white fish clips and the box pinch points.  My 4 year old son adores this.  Finding that in 2 player, even shooting with my non-dominant hand doesn't provide enough challenge since the board only has 1 setup.

The kids love this one. They are really crazy about it. I admit, I also like this little dexterity game. Score points by shooting your pinguin through the doors, but beware of the catcher! Fun, light game for the kids, but even adults like it.

The doorway rules are clear and simple. The penguins are weighted so you CAN do trick shots and wild spins.

Decent flicking game.  The wobbly penguins are great as they allow for curved shots.

Better with a full player count as there are more chances to hit people (even though that's not what you're supposed to do).

RATING: 5
An entry-level flicking game that is primarily aimed at children. It is just too simplistic to keep your attention for longer than a play or two, really. The idea for building the board from the box it pretty cool although the box seems to be a little flimsy and you can easily get annoying gaps between the rooms.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Another fun dexterity game that seems to be aimed at kids but adults will like it as much, if not more, than their kids.  Atleast, we do! :-)

 Each round, players take turns being "it" and trying to bump in to all the other players to score fish cards(ie.read victory points).  Whilst the players do all they can to avoid being hit while flicking their penguin through the doorways with the color above in order to score fish cards as well.

 Clever rules and flicking mechanism for this game. And an even more clever interchangeable board.

Fun dexterity game that is fast to set up and play, and doesn't get ruined by somebody bumping the table (I'm looking at you, Jenga), or a crazy-eyed kid destroying the setup in two seconds (Kerplunk, Don't Break the Ice).  

Card point values may inject a little too much luck -- perhaps just make each card worth a point.  Another thought: rather than having a player end the round (by getting last fish), have them trigger the end of the round so each player gets an equal number of shots.

Fun dexterity game! The character's base and center of gravity allows for some very distinct moves and skill shots like curves and jumps over walls. The "box within a box" system is a very ingenious way to transport a larger level.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Complicated penguin gadgets, designed so as to make the coolest 10% of shots in your dexterity game a lot cooler, while the other 90% become clumsy or painful. (Okay, 75% become clumsy or painful, 15% would have been anyway.) Worth it? Not worth it.

Also, the title pun is clever and doofy at the same time. Not in the way puns usually are, I mean. Extra doofy.

Oh wow, I seriously underestimated this at first. This is a brilliant design. The box, the simple rules (which do contain some holes which don't matter all that much), the catch-up mechanism. The designer's "name". The possibility of playing this really well. And the adaptability to different skills (by determining which kind of flicking is allowed). Great. My kids fell in love with the game and we gave it to them for Christmas, so I am playing this a lot right now.

I'm a big fan of dexterity games, but while seemed well thought out and balanced, i just didn't feel it.  Let's start out with that my kid loves it, in fact asks to play it often.  Second, the way the box is set up plus the pieces are great, especially the quality. Probably the reason i wasn't a fan could be the boxes you need to play within.  The doorways add a bunch to the game, but it may be that I'm used to playing dexterity games outside the box.  I'm not sure 100%, maybe I'll change my mind after a few more plays.

Flicking game where the box itself is the game board. Comes with 4 boxes that are held together by little wooden fish clips that come with the game. Box footprint is quite small once packed away.

I'm awful at dexterity games. Icecool was fun though. The only thing I didn't like was its randomness regarding card draw. A buddy of mine lost although he got a lot more cards but had bad luck drawing high points. That's a design flaw in my opinion. Otherwise it's great for families or small boardgame parties.

A fun little flicking dexterity game. I like how each player gets a chance to be the 'hall monitor' with a different goal of trying to catch the other 'students'. The downside is I find the cute little penguin figurines somewhat painful to flick.

This is our first flicking game so I can only compare the experience of playing a flicking game to not playing a flicking game. Standing on its own, the super silly premise combined with the well-designed pieces makes for a super duper rad playing experience. There isn’t a lot of thinking, not much strategy, but enough trying to outwit the hall monitor while testing your own finesse to make this one I can see coming back to often. I cannot see that I would ever turn down this game unless I had a broken flicking finger or a torn nail or something. Good times, good fun.

First time ever playing a dexterity game. Its simple yet frustrating at the same time and the player can only blame them-self. Most of the fun during "Ice Cool" is either hitting the penguin and doing something cool or totally messing up. I was afraid that the pieces would hurt our fingers after flicking them around. But the penguins are just perfect to push and flick around.

A "flicking" game that I'm very happy to play. I can definitely see that with some practice it would be possible to reliably control those pesky penguins, but it's still fun without that level of control. Definitely a game to be played standing up as people will want to walk around the table to take "shots".

Another of those games that, while it can be played once in a session, it's usually best to play several games to let some luck aspects (particularly the cards) even out. Besides, it takes so little time to play that you might as well play 2 or 3 or even more games.

RATING: 7
This is a fun and quick dexterity game. You are flicking penguins around a school built up from a set of 5 nested boxes, including the bottom half of the game box itself. The players will take turns playing a catcher, while the others play runners. Runners want to snap up fish as they zoom through doorways with fish hanging from them, catchers want to catch the runners and get their school ID. Each round ends when either one of the runners have caught all their fish tokens or the catcher has captured all the student IDs.

This is an attention drawing game. As we were playing the rest of the group stood around us watching the game unfold. It is also a bit skillbased as the penguins are round and weighted figures, which makes it possible to make the penguin spin and pretty much make a u-turn through two doors, or with practice you can even make them jump over walls by flicking them on their head. I definitely enjoyed it, as did my fellow players, and I can't wait to later on try it out with family, as I think the game could become a hit there as well.

My favorite dexterity game currently. Ice Cool really shines with its ability to wow my friends and family and have us all laughing, shouting and congratulating each other on an amazing shot, or bemoaning a whiffed attempt. Fun with my gamer friends and my non-gamer friends too. For that reason, and the fact that I am a personally a huge fan, it gets to the table quite often.

I really enjoy this game. One of the better dexterity (physical) games I've played for sure. My only small problem is that I feel it's a tad short. I'd love an expansion making a bigger board or even adding some more penguins of different shapes and such. This game could be incredibly deep if they wanted it to be but overall I love it how it is. I just usually play like 3 times for game night cause it's a bit fast. I do love how you actually get better at flicking the penguins though. Super neat.

Video Review - https://youtu.be/43chpwmdTO0

Ice cool is a flicking dexterity game set in a penguin school. The penguin pieces really make this game. They are rounded on the bottom and weighted. This means you can curl them, and even make them jump.

The game plays out as cat and mouse with players taken turns to be the hall monitor and the other pupils. The pupils are trying to get fish by passing under certain doorways, while the monitor is trying to tag all the pupils. When the monitor tags everyone or a pupil gets all three fishes of their colour players swap roles until everyone has been the monitor once. 

The school is the box! It's a clever box in box system. My only complaint is the scoring system but check out the variants forum for my house rules.

Cute, but not my thing. (Won my first game, but simply by shooting straight.) I'm sure fancy shots are possible with practice, but the cheapness of the cardboard boxes, the wobblyness of the penguins, and board seams are off-putting if one wants to get "really good". Not a dexterity game I enjoy. Do not want.

[b]Ice Cool[/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> [b]10[/b]):[/COLOR]

[i]Ice Cool has continued to get played in our house; it is such a fun game. I can't recommend this game highly enough for families no matter how old your kids are; my son is 15 and still has a blast playing. Ice Cool was my pick for the best family game of 2016 and has become my family's favorite dexterity game with Animal Upon Animal being a close second. After recently playing Riff Raff, another dexterity game I thought my family would enjoy, it made me appreciate just how fun and simple Ice Cool is. There aren't any rules or "gamey" mechanics to get in the way of the fun [i](see my comments on Terror in Meeple City and Riff Raff)[/i]. I'd consider Ice Cool and essential game for any family's collection![/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]An absolutely amazing dexterity game that doesn't try and get too gamery (Rampage was fun but the scoring/special powers bogged the game down). In my opinion the best dexterity games keep it simple and Ice Cool does that. You are either trying to get your fish by flicking your penguin through doorways or "catch" other people's penguins by hitting them with your penguin. You receive point cards (with 1 - 3 vp on them) and highest total wins. You can reveal two number 1 cards and get an extra turn, that's it for rules. 

All that said, what makes this game amazing is the penguins themselves. They are similar to weeble wobbles which makes flicking them fun and sometimes unpredictable. However; the more you play the more consistently you can pull off some amazing shots. My kids right now are focused on getting their penguins to jump walls. 

There is nothing left to say, this game is pure fun. If you have a family you should definitely get this game, if the folks you game with like games like Loopin' Louis I'd highly recommend Ice Cool. Ice Cool has replaced Animal Upon Animal as my favorite dexterity game.[/i]

This is a cute little flicking games with weeby wobbily penguin pieces. The goal is to flick your way through the doorways, or if you are the chaser, to hit the other player's pieces. It's delightful and quick, although maybe a little limited in that once you've mastered the weeble wobble, the game doesn't change substantially. Still a delight once in awhile.

Ich bin wahrlich kein Fan von Geschicklichkeitsspielen. Es macht mich aggressiv gegen meine Freundin zu verlieren und gerade bei Schnippspielen würde ich eher die Inneneinrichtung zerschießen, als dass ich das Spiel gewinnen würde. Dieses Spiel macht allerdings einen Heidenspaß und ist dabei für groß und klein ansprechend. Am meisten reizen mich die möglichen Trick-Shots über Abgrenzungen und um Ecken. Mit normalen Holzscheiben wäre es nicht halb so witzig, die Beschaffenheit der Pinguine mit dem tiefen Schwerpunkt macht das ganze aber höchst empfehlenswert.

This simple flicking game I will play anytime that my children pull it out to play, and will on occasion pull it out as a filler game to play with friends.  My younger child loves flicking her penguin, and sending it in through the board.  My older child enjoys trying to understand directing his penguin to curve or bounce over walls based on where he flicks it.  The game play is fast and keeps everyone engaged.

I love dexterity games that truly reward mastery of the moves. The penguins seem very difficult to flick at first, but you slowly learn all of the different ways you can increase the success rate of complicated trick shots. Pulling off that one big move in Ice Cool is one of the most rewarding experiences I've had in a dex game. Hope to see expansion content in the future!

This was silly fun and a blast to play with the family. Not a lot of strategyor depth here. I'm still playing around with all of the "cool" flicking skills and being accurate and consistant. It's probably is a more exciting game with people that are on the same level with flicking skills and if those skills are mediocre/poor.

RATING: 8.5
Oh wow. A flicking game that does a lot of things right and actually a vast improvement over the likes of Pitchcar or even Rampage. 

Like Rampage or Flick 'Em up it's flicking meets thematic immersive experience. You're a penguin in a penguin school during recess and you're either trying to grab some fish you're not supposed to or catch other penguins trying to do so. It's one against many, but every round another person is the one who has to catch others. 

Good stuff:
- Flicking has depth - yes, instead of disks the wobbly penguins offer various shots you can perform and even get better at (or so they say).
- Border situations are clear - each room has a line where you move your penguin to, if it's too near the wall.
- Random allocation of points (1, 2, 3) has a twist - getting two 1 point cards get you ice skates. Means: extra move. Means: surprises and twists!
- Inexpensive. 
- Russian dolls style of storing the board/boxes. Pretty clever. 

Neutral stuff: 
The edges of the boxes are a bit high, making it a bit hard to flick from certain positions. 

Impressed. Possibly a better family game than SdJ winner this year (Kindgomino). It's fun, it's diverse, it's deep, it's stupid. Did I mention fun?

Ice Cool is a nice little dexterity game. It shines with a short setup time ... especially compared to what you get on the table, because the box is very cleverly designed. Also because of the way the payer figures are weighted the movement is rather 'fresh'. Practice has a noticable effect. Overall I think this game is quite enjoyable, though I still wouldn't buy it. It might be worth it if you have kids. The required precision and strength-control one needs to be successful is quite significant, but not impossible to achieve.

This is a goofy, fun game and probably shouldn't be rated at the 7.5 I gave it, but, then again, maybe it should be higher because my kids, even my kids in their 20's, have so much fun playing it.  My 13 year old and I will play a game of house rules TAG for an hour at a time.  It's so silly and stupid, but its just fun and you find yourself lining up shots like you would in a game of pool and practicing curving your penguins around corners.  If you have kids, just get it! lol.

1 play, 4er

Such a fun game, with an awesome set of nesting boxes! The boxes create a set of rooms with doorways connecting them. Several doorways are marked with a token of your color. Your job is to flick your little penguin through the doorways and collect a VP card worth 1-3VP (you can reveal a pair of 1s to immediately take another turn). You play 1 round/player. Each round, one of the players uses different rules: instead of aiming for doors, they're aiming for other players -- you earn your VP cards by making contact with other players' pieces. After n rounds, most VP wins!

What a great, compact, fun little game! And apparently you can get pretty good at it!

This is a dexterity game played with tiny penguin shaped weebles (they wobble but they don't fall down).

The design here is really cool.  The map is made up of these 3D rooms with doors that you clip together.  The doors on these rooms are intentionally smaller than the standing height of the penguins.  So in order to traverse the rooms on the map you need to be able to flick your penguins in such a way that they lean while going through doorways (or you can jump them over the walls).  The little penguins are designed so this is very possible with practice and there is a lot of dexterity skill to be learned with these tiny little penguins.

The game is played by each player taking a turn being the "catcher"  This penguin is trying to ram each of the other penguins and gets points based on the number of other penguins he manages to catch.  The other penguins are trying to move through specific doors and get points based on the number of these doors they travel (as well as points if they are not caught by the catcher).  Each round ends with either the catcher catching all the other penguins or one of the penguins traversing all 3 of the target doors.

This is fine for a dexterity game.  There is skill involved in flicking the penguins properly and the board is neat...but it would probably get boring quickly.  The board is set up exactly the same every time, the starting positions are exactly the same every time, and especially when players become more skilled it will probably play out pretty similarly every time.  Also, just from a simple balance and design perspective I probably wouldn't recommend playing with any fewer than 4.  With 4 the maximum point potential of each player is balanced among all players including the catcher.  With 2 or 3 the catcher has an inherent disadvantage in that any individual penguin can achieve more points in a round than he possibly can.

At Spiel this year the published didn't cut back on putting this game out there. They had a huge booth with just this game and all tables where constantly filled.
With good reason it seems: this is a family friendly dexterity game that does allow for more advanced play. That's because the shape of the pawns allows for trick shots. Good stuff, I wouldn't mind owning a copy of this. Maybe I should have bought one!

This is a brilliantly clever bit of construction, with boxes inside boxes which all fit together really nicely. The gameplay was... decent if a little uninspired. It's a perfect convention game in that it is easy to play and super simple to pick up, but there is really no depth there and after a half a game, you've seen just about everything the game has to offer.

This is a super simple flicking game that brilliantly uses the boxes to make a large maze-like map.  The pieces that you flick are very asymmetrical with a low center of gravity that opens up the possibility for many different types of shots, including jumping over walls.  It also makes it sometimes challenging to flick it straight.

Flicking isn't really my cup of tea and I was completely terrible at it in my first play, so I'm not the biggest fan.  But if you like flicking, you should definitely check this out.

I liked it more than I expected, as I'm not a fan of most dexterity/flicking games in general. The most unique thing is the trade-off between being a regular penguin and being the catcher. As a regular penguin you're trying to just move through the halls and collect your points. When it's your turn to be the catcher, you just try to catch all of the other penguins.

Fun, will play occasionally.

:star: The penguins' shape enables some super fancy trickshots when you develop your skills somewhat (I'm not there yet, but I'm having fun trying!)
:star: Superb artwork
:star: Box in a box in a box is an approach that combines fairly little required shelf space with a fairly large game board
:star: I like the extra turn idea tied to lower-valued point cards
:star: Plays quickly and inspires enthusiasm (unless you're playing with someone who's dead inside), and that makes it likely you'll play again

:nostar: Only 4 players (which makes sense - more players means more rounds and longer rounds - but still, I often have 5 players)
:nostar: Point values between 1 and 3 don't quite feel fair; I'd like to try dropping the 1-point cards and giving the extra turn ability to 2-point cards, but there aren't enough 2- and 3-point cards to play 4-player with just them

Fun flicking game. I like the way the boxes form the board. The hidden (and random) scoring cards add some tension to the game. Someone with more cards isn't necessarily going to win the game so you always feel like you're in the running.

[thing=177524][/thing] is a quite simple dexterity game: one player per round will be the hall monitor, trying to catch the penguim students that aren't in class, while the students are trying to eat as many fishes possible. The monitor needs to touch the students pieces to catch them, which will be worth one fish card per student caught at the end of the round; while the students need to avoid the monitor and pass by some predetermined places in order to get fish cards. This is all done by flicking the penguim meeples. Easy and fun.

There is, however, problems: the smaller one is the luck factor, as the fish cards have values ranging from 1 to 3; and even if two 1 cards allow a double flick once, the difference of taking lower cards to someone gaining the highest, gets large fast. The biggest problem is the antigame: the students need to pass by two places that connect with the starting area of the monitor. With that, is usually much better for the monitor just remain around the place he starts, waiting for the students to get near to cacth them. Is boring, outside the spirit of the game, but is also allowed and efficient. The distribution of the places the students need to pass should be diferent.

Still, overall, [thing=177524][/thing] isn't a game for strategic thoughts or deep analysis - it is a game to flick penguins and hope for the best. [thing=177524][/thing] delivers enough to entertain in a light and uncomplicated mood. Yet, there are plenty of better light dexterity games around, like [thing=2452][/thing], [thing=91514][/thing], [thing=37196][/thing], among others. In the end, [thing=177524][/thing] is just average and harmless.

RATING: 5
This isn't really a game so much as fun activity. I say that because there aren't set scores for the various feats you can perform with the spinning penguins. You simply get to draw a randomized point card, so a cool three room spin off a wall into a blind corner may be worth less points than a straight flick at a target 1 inch away.

I don't know if that's a fair critique, as I suppose you could say a three rail bankshot in 9-ball is worth the same as straight in shot...but I think that is because there is a fixed victory condition linking all those shots.

At any rate, it is a lot of silly fun and the box is a work of pure genius. Don't take my lowish rating at face value, as I am simply not a big dexterity fan. If you are, I can safely say this will be worth a few clicks more on the rating scale for you.

Ice Cool features a very cool box, and board design, utterly clever. I also quite enjoy the gameplay. You can do so many cool trick shots with the penguins.

Fun family dexterity game. It's great trying to figure out how to get the penguins to move in weird ways.

Excellent components and it looks amazing on the table. Pulling off trick shots is difficult but you can get some funny and unexpected moves with the penguins. Sometimes crossing the gaps in the board pieces can be difficult though. Rating may rise with more plays.

The control over the penguins is excellent. There's no satisfaction like jumping two rooms directly onto your target. Of course, not every shot is so lucky. The "tag" rules of this game are pretty cool, and I like that getting saddled with 1-point cards (cards are worth 1–3) at least compensates you: Each pair of 1s can be deployed, without losing the points, to take an extra turn. You can still end up with some very lopsided point distributions, though, due to the nature of cards. Never mind all that, just flick some penguins already, and have fun!

Oh, and box-in-a-box? Very nice!

A nice variant on the drafting mechanic seen in games such as 7 Wonders, Fairy Tale and Sushi Go. The twist here is that you start with a hand of three cards before you start to place any on the table, which introduces a nice element of timing to the strategic choices. It is not only about which cards to play, but when to play them. There is a fair amount of interaction (more than in the previously mentioned games) and that also sets the game aside. It isn't better than the other drafting games, but it's different enough that it is worth owning even if you already have similar games. I think this is a minor step forward for the genre.

Greed brings you card drafting in a gangster setting. You really have to get a few games under your belt before the game starts to make any sense, since on the first plays you will be just wondering what would be the best move. After learning the combos each round you'll be facing interesting choices each round.

I am sure that if you invested several hours learning the game, would it make a decent one. I am just not ready to make that investment.

A nice little game by Donald X. (Designer of dominion) where you spend 12 rounds building a criminal empire of holdings, criminals, and crimes in an effort to accumulate the most wealth by the end of the game. The central mechanic is drafting similar to other games like lost legends and 7 wonders. I've gotten a lot of plays out of Greed and have few complaints other than the tiny numbers used to determine order of resolution. I think that this could have been handled better. In sum, Greed is Good :)

This one may go up in rating with more plays.  It's quite quick to play but feels like it has a good strategic depth.  It is also quick and easy to setup and cleanup.

Update 10/5/2014: 
While I enjoy this one at 3+, as a 2 player game, the engine/combo building in this one really suffers from a very limited draft pool.  There really should have been some additional dummy rules added for this as seen in some other drafting games.

Update 11/15/2014:
I can't get this one played enough with 3+ players and I don't see this situation changing anytime soon.  Unfortunately, this one will have to leave my collection even though it is a good drafting game.

This is a very quick card-drafting engine-building game. For many, I suspect it will play like a filler-plus. But if you attempt to memorize the card-types, each hand, it evolves into something much more brain-burning and deep. Now, many players don't like memorization games but I've always found it to provide it to be a skilful endeavor. 

The component quality, of the cardboard money chips, is quite disappointing (Kickstarter backers received wooden chips, which are quite nice). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Inspired drafting system with each player getting 12 cards (from 80), drawing one and passing on the others.  Play is simultaneous and in card number order.  You are seeking combos and income.  Quick and fun filler with lots of groan factor and enough cards to want to explore further.

Not very good with just 2 players, but with 3 or more, plays quite well.  A card drafting game with a 'pick a card, pass the deck' mechanism, quite a bit of game is packed into 3 basic types of cards.  (Thug, Holding, Action) This game builds off the cards you have played, so if you aren't careful, you can set yourself up for failure.

Interesting little card drafting game. We played a 2 player game of this. Basically, you hold one card and pass the rest of your hand (you start with 12 card) to your opponent. Then, once you have 3 cards held, you play one and then pass. Cards give money or Holdings which are worth $10,000 for each symbol at the end of the game. Thugs give special powers and symbols which are requirements for many other cards. This was nice and simple but very light. No great strategy here. Next games will be with more players.

I'm probably being a bit harsh on this game because of its price tag, but it's not very good. It's just card drafting around the table and to 3 cards and then also playing one card per turn. The chaos is high with attacks that destroy cards and build up symbols to gain bigger benefits and so on. It's over very fast and doesn't seem to require too much thought (other than remembering what was in the other hands of cards that you just passed to the player on your left).

If it cost $10 and came in a tiny box then I may feel differently about it. I'm fine with paying $50 for Dominion cards because that game clearly required serious design and development to get it to where it is. This game obviously went through some of that, but is just a quick light filler with very little substance. If I was comparing it to No Thanks! or For Sale then it still isn't as good, but at least it's in the ball park. However, at $50 MSRP, I'm comparing it to Dominion and games like that and this isn't even close.

Initial Impressions:
-----------------------
I was really worried about this one going in, however I ended up enjoying it.  I really like drafting games, and this one does seem to take fairy tale, and make it a little more combative, while also giving it some theme.  Fairy tale is something I can always play, and have never gotten tired of it.  I think if this can end up having that kind of longevity, this would will actually rise for me.  Very much looking forward to more plays.  Curious also how this one scales.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A quick and dirty card game that uses drafting as it's central mechanic.  The simple goal is to have the most money at the end.  You will need to figure out which mobsters, buildings and devious actions can best help you achieve this goal.  I love it.  Plays very well with 2.  

7 Wonders gets all of the glory...then Fairy Tale.  Greed is sadly destined to become a lost relic of Donald X Vaccarino's designs.

Each time I play this, I like it more.  It's a simple, quick drafting game with a decent amount of take that.  Once people know the game, a hand shouldn't take more than 15 - 20 minutes (maybe less).  There's a fair amount of randomness as one strategy is drafting to get sets and you don't know if you'll get the icons you'll need, but in a 15 minute game?  who cares?  Fun and quick and easy to teach.

Keeper!

I love games where you get a selection of cards that can interact a bit, and you make the best out of what you get. This game definitely didn't disappoint for that type of game.

Every player starts with some cards, picks one, and passes to the left.  You then get to play a card from your hand (there are two "set-up" rounds where all you do is pick and pass, forming your hand), and do what it says to do.

You'll see thug cards, which will likely grant you abilities, holding cards, which will accumulate chips that are worth money at the end of the game, and action cards, which have one time effects.  All the while, you'll need to balance accumulating symbols which will make it easier to play future cards vs. making money, which wins you the game.

Once there are no more cards to pass, the game is over, and most cash wins (with tokens being worth $10k each).  Simple as that, but a really great game in the superfiller vein.  Since Sushi Go is so popular, I'd describe this as "Sushi Go for Gamers".

This game also gets better the more I play.  I think the first game for anyone is going to tend to feel a bit random.  However, once you've played a game or two, you really see the game emerge, where players try to discern what "engine" there is to build out of the cards used in that particular game, as only a portion of the deck is used in a particular play of the game.  It becomes a puzzle to solve, rather than merely a collection of cards that do stuff.

Drafting game where every card is unique. Plays quick, but shines imo with a lower player count (3-4 max), because then the cards come back several times and require to carefully consider each time which cards you want to pass and which one you'd like to see return to you.

Fast, engaging, and some interesting things going on in a cheap and easy to digest package.  The game is simple but offers depth and repeated play for sure.  I really enjoy how you only use a small portion of the cards each play, as well as the fact that you draft more cards than you play.  This allows you to draft cards simply to deny other players, which is interesting.  Theme is solid too.

Game went just a little long, (45 minutes, versus 30 mins) but that was my own fault by not being 100% on some small rules that came up as the game was getting played.  The rule book was small and good, but couldn't have EVERY eventuality in there.  Once we got flowing I see how we can fly through this game.  I am hoping the replayability is there.  Excellent game though.  I like that there is enough theme there to explain the game, but still a simple game there.  This game is RIPE for expansions, and ripe for rules lawyer arguing.  It was great that my first group didn't have the rules lawyers amongst them.  We will see what happens when they do get involved.  As people get to know the cards more,and until there are expansions, will we find the game to be "solved".  Until then this gets a pretty good rating, and after my lunchtime group saying they wish they didn't have meetings to go to, as they all wanted another play, this will be around for a while!

I didn't want to make too much about tying the theme in with the gameplay, but it is there.  When you buy a thug, is he handy with a gun, or a is he more of a getaway driver... or is he good at both.  What about a mechanic (with his spanner...)  You buy a bar, there's alcohol there...  A place full of ladies of ill repute, you get a love heart... because there's a lot of love there.  It definitely underlies the game more than being in your face, but once I realized that last night it certainly added to the experience for me.

RATING: 8
On the one hand, it was fun working out how to perform combos. On the other hand, one player's combos shut down the other two players and there was really nothing they could do to come back. It wasn't even a situation where hate drafting would have helped as the key card was pulled at random from the draw deck.

It is a short game, mind, going even faster than one would expect considering the game begins with twelve cards you need to read, then eleven, and on and on until the cards come back around. Which is a neat trick. No idea why it starts off as quickly as it does.

The use of sex work in the game can also be something that some will not find fun to play with in a game (it doesn't help that it is more like sexual exploitation/slavery in the game, as only thugs are characters, the sex workers are more like property).

Is that all there is?  View 12 cards, three at a time, hope you get combinations?  I must be misunderstanding something about the rules.

OK, after reading the description, I see I missed some things that I didn't find clear in the rules.  I didn't see that you (a) look at all the cards in the deck, not just draw one randomly; (b) pass the remaining cards to the next player after each draft.  I'll give it another try.

A surprise find of a game for me. I really like the drafting mechanic so I decided to pick this game up and was pleasantly surprised by the game. It's very quick to play and doesn't take much to learn the game. It does feel a bit chaotic with the card play with some cards affecting everybody in a turn. It reminded me of Fairy Tale because of the length of play and the card collecting aspect, only Greed seems better because it has a better theme and is more interactive, and more fun. I would like to see more expansions to this because I think there still is a lot of potential this game has yet to expose.

RATING: 7
A decent card drafting game where the whole game is one round and your initial hand of cards will make several revolutions around the table. It's easy to get stuck in some no win situations (no money, no pre-requisites) so first timers might get trounced a bit before learning the pitfalls. On the other side of that, you can really play well if you can remember the stuff going around the table. Also on the plus side is that it is a rather quick game (30 mins) and the replay ability is huge because you only see maybe 40% of the cards each game. It's hard to have a general strategy until you see what cards are in play.

Drafting game where you draft a hand of three cards, then play one, then draft a new one to refill. Cards are thugs, enterprises, and actions. All cards have symbols. When you play the card you get to use the symbol. Cards can have costs or symbol requirements to play. You are basically trying to build a little bit of an engine. Overall, a perfectly functional and totally uninteresting game.

I really like this game, and truly hope it gets some expansion support (don't let me down Donald- you know you love expansions Ala Dominion). A great card drafting game that's still not that complicated and easy to teach.  A step up from Sushi Go (my intro to drafting game), but a whole lot easier to step into than 7 wonders for newbies to drafting.  I think waiting until the 3rd turn to begin playing cards so that you can get more knowledge and start building a strategy is an ingenious addition to the mechanic.  Popping off combos is really addictive and rewarding in this game.  I also love the adult theme as it helps me show people that board games are not always for kids.

Card drafting game from Queen Games. The creator is the same as Dominion, so it has some same vibes.  In particular, the cards that play on top of each other with building mechanisms. 

Overall, it's a good game. Not crazy addictive, but a fun filler. 

I was disappointed with the crude artwork. It's a gangster theme but with an entire overemphasis on sex and related activities. I prefer more family related games.  I don't want to have to explain an over sexualized picture of a massage parlor to my kids.  PG-13 leaning R.

A bit more going on in the game compared to Sushi Go, but not strategically as involved as 7 Wonders. Game does suffer from having too many words which can mean that the drafting phase can be a little slow for what it is. However, still a fun and easy to teach game. Unfortunately it was fired by Medieval Academy, who scratches the same itch but eliminates the whole issue I have with too many words and symbols on cards.

Light-medium weight card drafting game. Fans of card drafting games will want to check it out since you can now affect everyone else depending on your strategy rather than be dependent upon where you are sitting like 7 Wonders. The draft play is more linked to card combos than a sense of progression like the civ-minded 7 Wonders.

Not a fan of the theme which is what holds this game back for me. I can see a different theme and artwork making this game more interesting to me. Not all the cards are used in the game so you have a decent amount of variability and good play is tactical.

A luck-heavy drafting game that needs some work to be the light 'starter' it wants to be.  Recommendation: punt the needless card-order numbering nonsense, and just have the lowest number start (and go clockwise from there).  That doesn't quite iron this out to 'smooth' but it'll help it play a few minutes faster, letting the theme and grouping-based scoring take center stage.

[thing=151247][/thing] reminded me so much of a complex version of The City, the Tom Lehmann classic which unbelievably is yet to be published in English.    You  build a kind of engine from cards which circulate around the players, and this engine provides money or takes money from others.  Cards act as buildings or hit men, some do one-off things, some help you build your tableau for future gains.    It plays in 30 minutes and is entertaining, not least because the mafia theme is well layered over the top.

Greed is probably my favorite pure-drafting game. It has text instead of icons which makes it a lot easier for new people to jump into. It also has good variety out of the box due to not using all of the cards each time you play. The thing I like most about it, however, is that it's more combo driven than things like 7 Wonders and Fairy Tale. The game is more interactive than other drafting games, which could be a positive or negative, depending on your point of view. The graphic design is functional and the artwork is just serviceable. The theme is unique, but not suitable for children. This is also very expensive for what you get in the box. I think this had very good potential to be a more successful game, except for a few bad choices made by the publisher.

As for the game, interesting so far, although I think Greed plays best with three or more players. Two can fall a little flat. It's quick and simple to explain, so a good filler or taster.

Played this a week back with disastrous results, due to a basic mistake in reading the rules (we drafted twice ONLY in the whole game). Played again with the proper rules and the thing really came alive. The drafting got very interesting, the timing of my decisions, the tension as to what good cards your opponents would leave, the direction my gang went and also the other gangs, the direct and indirect inter-action. It all got very good. I lost due to one or two errors, and the novice player won by a mile despite a misreading. But it was all very satisfactory and I look forward to playing it more.

Card drafting 7 Wonders-style with a bit of nastiness in the cards. Being able to keep back cards to play them at a later time in the game opens up some interesting possibilities but then again I'm not sure the card functions as present reward any kind of strategic play. The major downside compared to its more famous relative, however, is the amount of text that needs to be parsed each turn, and it doesn't exactly help that the cards get less interesting as the game progresses.

After few more plays - the game is marvelous! Solid 9! Although at times it might be random, very random - it's a card game, isn't it?. This is especially true in 5-player mode, with much less cards returning to your hand. :)

Box is so ridiculously oversized!! Thanks Queen Games. A small deck of cards and foldable directions do not need a fat, squatty box.

That being said, the game is quite easy to pick up & play. Only 3 types of cards (Thugs, Holdings, & Actions). I don't think the artwork or theme comes across as racy at all- save for perhaps 1 or 2 cards (and those aren't bad), but I wouldn't play this with young kids (10 or under), just because they wouldn't understand the topic. You only use a portion of the deck each game, so replayability is pretty high.

Divergent strategies are viable and drafting mechanism mitigates almost all card luck.  Original theme and artwork are a satisfying overlay.  Cards are balanced and work well with each other.  Expansion(s) would do wonders and I wished the cards would have been linen finished.  A lot of fun and quick but can invoke deep thought!

RATING: 6
While being a nice, easy drafting game, something here is falling flat. Why does this game feel so lifeless when Sushi Go (much lighter and simpler) works so well? I think the cards in Greed just don't hold together as well -- they all feel very disconnected. Each one has its own little special power, and there's certainly opportunities for synergy, but there's no overall direction. The artwork certainly drags it down as well, very generic.

Really solid pure drafting, with lots of painful sequencing problems. Because the sequencing of play is the challenging part, I guess actually the brilliant addition here is the two starting rounds where you choose a card and don't play it; thereafter you have three cards to pick from each turn (including the one you just selected). Nice work!

It is a little bit like being put in a straitjacket, but it's a fun straitjacket and it's different every time, which if all straitjackets were like that we probably wouldn't talk about them like they were a bad thing.

Not terrible gameplay, but just a slight bit confusing next to something like 7 wonders. The upside is that it works well with 2 players. The only thing that keeps the rating this low is how crude the game is. I went to play this game for the first time, with a bunch of high school students, not knowing that there were strip clubs and scantily clad women all over the artwork... The Kickstarter page really didn't prepare me for what I was buying. Trying to trade, even though it really is a good game... Played once. Like-New Condition right out of the KickStarter

There are still precious few pure drafting games out there, and this one can go toe-to-toe with 7 Wonders. In fact, there may even be a bit more depth in the draft itself. Unfortunately, the theme is really unappealing to me and most of the people I play with. I have no desire to shoot people or manage a brothel. A re-theme would almost certainly make this a must-buy for me.

RATING: 7
Drafting game where you have a hand of sorts (extra cards you're probably won't get to play) and have a mixture of cards that stay in play and one-time actions. Works rather well most of the time. Seems like 3-4 is the sweet spot. Basic version has really lame thin money markers, the KS edition has much nicer wooden ones.

Not likely to blow anyone away with amazement but a solid game.

RATING: 7.5
I got it at SPIEL'14, Essen, but I'm not completely sold on it yet. I want to like it: the theme, the drafting, the relatively short play time. I'm even fond of the simplistic, almost amateurish artwork.

As some other already wrote: I think you have to play it a couple of times to get a feel for your possibilities. As you use only a fraction of the cards (between 24 and 60 out of 80) in each game, experiences can differ a lot. Some cards are stronger than others (which is not a problem, as you are passing cards around a lot...); some games may have such a mixed bag of cards that good combinations are harder to get than usual.

*If* you can organize a good set of cards and have a killer combo in the last third of the game, then it shines and can be fun. In every other game it just doesn't happen.

Sometimes I'd like the game to be longer to get better combos. Sometimes I wish it was shorter so we could play more consecutively.

I wonder if a variant of the drafting could make this better. Maybe 2 or 4 rounds like Among the Stars, with less cards (12 is pretty much to read) at hand each round.

[b]Update after ~10 plays[/b]

7.15 -> 7.5

I played this now with groups that actually *got into* the game, and then it works pretty well. Adults usually like the theme; the mechanics were praised as "easy to get". The first game for a new player is still a learning game, afterwards it gets better quickly.

A minus point that got confirmed, though: the game *is* pretty random with end scores ranging from 50k - 250k. If you can (and want) I recommend playing multiple games in a session. (Play time is ~20-40min for 2-5 players.)

Another *plus*, I noticed: game victory is usually *not* prematurely determined. The last two rounds can turn a game around pretty massively if a player set up a good tableau, sometimes gaining 50k+ in one of the last turns.

Greed now probably is in my Top 10 Games of 2014.

This is a great game to teach people about drafting.  It is much easier to learn and play than 7 Wonders and far less dependent on what your neighbor does.  It also avoids some of the complex calculation of points that skyrocket with extremely powerful combos.  Has combos but not the game busters of 7 Wonders.

Mostly good, and some ok parts to this drafting game by Donald X. Vaccarino. My main complaint is two fold. Why is this game in such an oversized box. I know, to get price-gouged by Queen games. and Two, the fact that no expansion for this will ever come out. The game ships with 80 cards in the box, all different, so that's a plus, but the game will lose steam without and type of support in the future. It's Lost Legends all over again, but at least here, there was definite more meat on the bone - which really sad considering Greed is 50% cheaper than the other.

This game is underrated to me. It does exactly what it sets out to do, which is drafting, and it does it without a hitch. The result is a game that is a nice two-player strategy battle, or a more interesting interaction of cards between multiple players that will keep you on your toes. Overall, a very solid game worth your money as a filler or occasionally more.

A game of mini-engines/combos built out of cards.  You draft 12 cards and play (usually) 10 so there is little time and space to invent these engines and make them working.
The creation of them is supplemented with high (mostly direct) interaction.
Replayability is ensured by the fact that not all cards enter the play every time.  And every card is in 1 copy – that increases the replayability too.

I like it very much.

Expansions please!!

EDIT: Possibly too destructive with 5 players. The effects of your polished combos might be nullified. 
 Too few returning cards also mean that you cannot pursue with what this game is about: creating and executing card combos. 
I don't recommend 5-player mode.

EDIT2: The replayability becomes an issue with repeated plays.  Still fun, but as I wrote: expansions please!!!

Games of Greed will be highly variable (it's Donald X., so of course there will be lots of possibilities). Every game uses only a portion of the deck and within a few turns players can devise an optimal strategy based on cards in play. This is a case where that high variability can both help and hurt the experience - sometimes the cards in play present interesting opportunities and other times it is a struggle to spot a powerful combo. It's an interesting game, but the lack of a consistently interesting possibilities from game to game weakens its appeal.

After the first play at two players, seems to have the good part of Fairy Tale with more going on than collecting sets. Played very quickly even on the first run. 

I normally just ignore theme once the game starts, but I'll admit the 60's crime thing can be a little awkward when you have to ]tell someone a particular card is a whorehouse or something. It probably would have been better with something else.

I love this drafting game! Simpler than Fairy Tale to teach with a really fun theme. The graphic style is really impressive- minimal but thematic. Easy to teach and everyone always wants to play it again.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (January 2017)

I have had Greed among my games since late 2014! I bought it because it was a Donald X. Vaccarino game but my desire to play it was low because I haven’t heard much about it, thus, I thought the game was regular or bad. This month I had the opportunity to play it and I was pleasantly surprised.

The rules are easy to learn. You can teach it under 12 minutes and play it under 30 minutes.

The art is very cool, the game components are ok.

I like the theme, but one of the friends I played the game with said he wouldn’t buy the game due to the theme.

Greed is a drafting game and as such, it is better with 3 players. With that configuration luck plays a very minor role and you will get more of the cards back, so you can plan ahead. With more players the game´s luck and chaos increase a lot. The drafting itself is very interesting because you always have at least 3 cards in hand making it much more strategic than other games of its kind. The decision of which card to keep and which card to play isn’t obvious.

I really like that you don’t play with all the cards all the time, a Vaccarino signature and one I love. Due to this I think the game has lots of replayability. Expanding it would be easy but I think the game didn’t do very well as I don’t hear anything about it these days.

Bottom line, I like Greed. It can perhaps get an upgraded rating from me with more plays. For now I will keep it in my game collection and I want to play it again soon. Perhaps it is an underrated game, but for me, it is another Vaccarino hit. Good Stuff.

RATING: 6
Each player starts with a pile of 12 cards. Every turn, a player drafts a card and the game ends on the turn the 12th card is drafted. In 10 of the 12 turns players play a single card after the draft and do or take what the card says. And that is the game! Most money at the end wins. There are three types of cards: thugs, holdings, and actions. Cards give you money, markers (worth money at the end) or icons. Icons can meet requirements for other cards. You can use the card types and icons to build combo chains to accumulate wealth faster than your opponents. Since the hand of 12 is passed around for drafting (a la 7 Wonders), you see all cards in the game, which allows you to partially plan the combos you are going to build (if others don't beat you to it). This visibility is the game's strength. This is a game I'd play, but it would only ever be chosen over a game like, say, Innovation, because of length. My son hated it, for some reason. A hand of 12 cards at the start of the game is a lot to parse and I suspect that had a lot to do with his disinterest. If my wife doesn't care for it either, it won't stick around.

RATING: 8
Quick and simple drafting game with a nice thematic integration. In the first two turns players only draft a card. From the third turn onwards, all players draft, play one card simultaneously and execute the effects. Cards can be gangsters, businesses or actions. Synergies in player tableaus are crucial to winning the game.

Each game, only a subset of all cards is used. Thus, no potentially game-breaking combos can be deliberately exploited although it helps to know the cards and their combos. It’s a fun game and we played it twice on the first outing. If only Queen’s pricing was more appropriate for what is provided within the box.

Fairly quick playing drafting game that has a fair bit of nastiness/take that in the card play.  Some of the nasty cards can be quite deadly.  Not sure if this one has legs nor if I really have fun playing this one.  Give it another go or two yet before judgement day.

I find the basic mechanisms of this game clever and it should be a fun filler but reading the text when the hands passed to you are large (at the beginning of the game) is time consuming and handling the card interactions is more than a bit too fiddly.  Maybe I need to play this a bit more.

This is a drafting game by designer darling Donald X. (Vaccarino, but I prefer "Donald X.") , who honestly hasn't made a game I'm really ga-ga for yet. It's got a unique them in that, while it uses the time-worn idea of mobsters and crime kingpins, it sets it in the late 60s rather than going with prohibition gangsters or modern mafia. It's a nice touch. 

It's hard for me to really say much useful here, because it's possible (probable, even) that we got a wildly uneven arrangement of cards (you only use a portion of them). There are three types of cards: Holdings (locations), Thugs (people), and Actions. There was a dearth of Thugs in our selection, which meant that the one person who drafted a couple before they ran out was at a huge advantage. The two players who didn't get any were missing icons that made locations and actions even possible to play. That said, I, who wasn't the guy with the thugs, came very close to winning with the stuff I was able to play. The third player felt completely shut out, unable to play most of the cards he'd drafted. 

With more players there'd be a larger pool of cards to draw from, and a simple reshuffle would have probably resulted in a different game, but although I didn't hate it, I also wasn't really eager for another immediate play.

UPDATE: Finally played this a second time. I didn't think much of it the first time around, as you can see, but I kept hearing from folks that it was pretty good, so I wanted to try it again. I think the first time around we had a really weird distribution of cards that stonewalled the action in the game. That that can happen is unfortunate, but the game plays quickly. This time things went much better and there were some real choices to be made. Sushi Go is still probably the one to beat here, but this is better than I thought. Raising to a 6.

I was initially very interested in this game because of, well... Donald X. I'm a big Dominion and Kingdom Builder fan, so I'm instantly interested by anything he designs.

I read the rules and lost most of my interest in the game. Apart from an off-putting theme, the game seemed to be a plain draft with nothing special going for it.

One play confirmed my fears about it: plain drafting, overload of reading cards in the first few turns, and nothing, nothing special.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a somewhat generic drafting game, though it's cleaner and simpler than 7 Wonders or even Fairy Tale. The spin in this game is the combos. Much like you would combo in Dominion within your deck build, this game has you doing it a bit more openly within a tableau. The downside is that some combos work better than others given certain player counts. Another negative is that while some combos are really great the draw back is that they make certain lackluster ones amazing in the face of them, basically giving away the game.

Perhaps with more plays timing will be a bigger element, balancing out the negatives I see. Overall a decent enough filler that we do enjoy.

Pros: 

Quick and simple drafting and set collection game. Figuring out how best to combo the cards you draft is fun.

Cons: 

Artwork is okay but doesn't really stand out which makes the theme feel paper thin. This could've been about anything else and still played the same exact way.

Surprisingly good! Feels like 7 Wonders, but plays in half the time while still retaining the same complexity, if not more so. Really needs an expansion with more cards to keep it fresh though. I feel like this game was made for me, because it's a filler that plays quickly, but offers some very difficult decisions to be made. It's really unfortunate that this hasn't received the support from Queen that it deserves.

Card drafting games had fallen off for me some after some initial plays of 7 Wonders, but Fairy Tale brought me back into the mechanic which got me to try this.  This right now is my favorite Card drafting game.  I enjoy the planning in the early game, the take that nature of the game at times, and the resource management to make it all work.  Easier to setup and play than 7 Wonders but also a little deeper and strategic than Fairy Tale.  Some cards have a more mature theme, so best to keep Fairy Tale for the younger gamers.

A couple of two player games into this I found it enjoyable. Neither of us had enough knowledge of cards to make meaningful strategies, but we were able to pick them out. 
I think this game has the potential to have epic nasty games to real clunkers because the available cards is limited each game. Some games some icons wont be in play at all rendering other cards useless.

I really like this game. But, for some reason, it doesn't "click" with about half of our group. We've played it a few times (we like card drafting games). But because we have a couple of people that just can't figure it out, we probably won't play it a lot.

A quite-enjoyable drafting game that's heavy on luck. On a first play, we almost completely missed the rule about how holdings cards work, being that it was quite far in the back of the rule book. Despite having only 80 cards in the deck, it feels like it could hold up through quite a few plays on the novelty value alone.

RATING: 7
A quick and simple drafting game with card effects that are chaotic but can be prepared for.

The components would fit in two Amigo card game boxes but since this is a Queen game, the box is non-square, non-standard, and way too big.

RATING: 8.5
Offers a lot of what Fairy Tale does, in a little bit more time. Each time I play I realize the potential and actual power of different cards. I typically play this at 2. It plays a little bit slower than other drafting games since every card is unique. Scores are always pretty close.

RATING: 8
Drafting with a deliciously seedy theme. Under the surface, there's nothing really new here, but the mobsters pretensions, the names and the art are all rather enticing. The drafting has probably been incorporated to balance a set of mechanics that wouldn't otherwise have ever worked, but there is a decent learning curve to the game and you have to have some idea of what you're doing in order to play well.

[i]This game fell completely flat. I love drafting games, but I felt like there was one thing to many to manage making it difficult to combo cards together. On top of that the theme is a huge turn off for me, I am surprised Queen chose a theme that is not family friendly at all.[/i]

RATING: 6
I like hand-passing-on games, but this didn't seem a lot of fun. To play well requires lots more downtime than the game requires, checking out all 12, 11, 10 and then 9 cards in the first 4 turns to see what's in play and what combos are possible. As well as noting what others have taken from the other hands if possible. Well, that's way more work than I'm interested in, so I end up picking something that might pay off the best and hoping the cards I need to do that come my way. Then we add a healthy dose of player-luck and take-that which can kill off your best scoring cards, and we end up with a game with a large dose of attributes I'm not a fan of. It's meant to be lightweight and if you play it as such, it's probably worth the effort. But I prefer others in the genre as cleaner and better suited to filler world.

RATING: 6
An interesting theme using a similar 7 Wonders mechanic. A few things that kept me from rating it higher; cards could've been identified easier with larger icons/bold colors, somehow adding to the game to easier create a strategy (there are many cards that are based on future cards that you receive from the player to your right). Also I felt that I really only focused on my on cards and didn't need to look at what others were playing to determine my choices.

RATING: 8
Very fun drafting game that I am glad I kickstarted. Being able to build and play from a hand of three cards really adds some interesting decisions and strategy to the game. The theme is also a refreshing change of pace. It plays great with all play counts but three is my favorite.

RATING: 6
This is a 7 Wonders-style drafting game in which you play 10 cards over 12 rounds--on the first two rounds you just draw to build up a hand of three, and you're left with two unused cards at the end of the game. The cards consist of people, who provide you with icons for prerequisites and possible special text, buildings, which also provide icons as well as score tokens (worth $10k) for the icons Taj Mahal-style (1 for the first one, 2 for the second one, etc), or actions that give you a one-time benefit. Whoever has the most money at the end wins. I liked having a hand, so I could have some control over the order stuff came out. My main complaint with this game is that it became less exciting as the game progressed, since all the best cards were already taken.

This card drafting game was based on mobsters and had an interesting theme.  Other than the theme, I liked the interaction of messing with your opponents and the focus on money.  It felt there were numerous ways to get the money, which I liked.

I thought its card drafting was a little clunky--build to a hand of three, then draft one to add to that group and play it.  I didn't like having higher needs to play certain cards when the game plays quickly and opponents can mess with your play area.

I primarily play games two player. One of our games was awesome (combos galore), one was pretty good, and one was very lackluster. In the lackluster game our last two turns we did nothing, since we had 2 card a piece missing requirements. I'm sure with more players this could be avoided. However, since the cards are numbered, it seems like it would be very easy to include a variant to play with "card x-y" or "cards y-z" in a two-player game, perhaps removing a set of dependencies and making the combos more interesting. If I played with more folks, I'm sure my rating would go up, because when it worked well it was awesome.

My drafting game of choice. Super happy I got this. Great variety, especially with lower number of players, although it works with all player counts. I prefer lower numbers because you have to make do with the little you have. It worked with a lot of different people. I love the theme as well - that 70s mobster scene, but the life of crime might turn some players off. However, the great mechanics make for a solid game regardless of the theme.

This is a quicker playing version of what's essentially 7 Wonders, but with a crime theme. There is also a little more player interaction, because many of the cards have significant attack effects that hit all other players. Since you are drafting the cards around, your strategy changes depending on which of the attack cards you pass along. It's a little confusing, because powerful cards have prerequisites, so early in the game it's hard to make the call between grabbing the power card and risk not grabbing what it needs, or grabbing what you need to get the power card out and hoping it makes it back around the table. I believe the game only has six different symbols, so it's not impossible, but it's very much about building one or two little combos and then using them as much as possible. I don't like that in a longer game like Bruges or Lewis & Clark, but this game is short enough that it's interesting.

I'd been interested to try Greed as I'm a huge fan of DXV's Kingdom Builder. It may have been influenced by learning it fairly late on a long day of games, but I didn't see much to excite me here.

This is a great little strategy filler type game.  The mechanics are easy.  Draft a card, play a card, execute card and resolve end of round cards.  As most Donald X games, simple mechanic but deep play.  this game is tough.  there is little luck as you have everything in front of you by the second turn so you have to develop a strategy with whats there and hope the cards you need are there but there is a defensive aspect because your opponent can recognize your strategy and start taking cards that you want.  Such an ebb and flow to this game and it was just a lot of fun piecing things together and watching you gang empire come together.  It a fast game that has such replay-ability that multiple games can be a game night or one game can be a filler.

It feels like it should be so much more than it actually is. On the surface it's a completely reasonable but bland drafting game. After many plays it's clunky, dull, and screams for rule adjustments/variants to get closer to what it should have been. Overall it's a monotonous drawn-out version of Tides of Time and we don't even like the smaller game all that much. We tried hard with Greed but in the end I don't know why we would ever play again when games like 7 Wonders and Sushi Go are more fun for all the effort of setup and Tides of Time accomplishes all the same things in a smaller and faster game.

I'm normally turned off by mafia/gangster games, but a few win me over thanks to good fun interesting gameplay and quirky art, like Greed (and Famiglia).

Unlike Famiglia, every card in Greed is unique, many with some text describing its special effect, so the first few games are slower as you need to read all the cards in your hand and mentally absorb them. But as you become familiar with the cards, games become much faster, we have found. We usually play 2-player, finishing in 15 or 20 minutes. And the rules are easy enough to teach friends quickly for multiplayer fun. The initial donaldx-esque random card distribution can sometimes really impact how the game develops in surprising ways.

It's a very addictive clever game! In less than 2 months after getting our set, I had 82 logged plays...

The only downside really is the typically too-large box with a lot of air, so popular with too many publishers.

Holy s'nikes!  This game slipped under the radar when it came out and I only picked it up due to a recommendation in the Hot Deals forum.  I'm glad I did!  This is an exciting card-drafting game that blows the competition out of the water.  There are only 4 rules for each round, but each card you play adds to how you win the game (most money.)  The gangster theme is one that we have been looking for and the theme marries with the game play very well.  It also plays well at 2-players with no special rules.  It is quick, easy to grasp, and has minimal setup/teardown.  If you are looking for a card-drafting game that will satisfy gamers and non-gamers alike, this is it!

Quick playtime, simple yet deep gameplay, and so much fun. I love the card combos and how the theme integrates so well into the gameplay. I must admit that I am a sucker for anything Mafia related though. I understand that's not everybody's cup of tea but that should not detract you from enjoying the clever mechanisms found here, because the gameplay is simply exquisite. I am hoping there's an expansion in the future that adds some clever stuff. Some cool bosses, special locations, events, etc. I understand this game has not exactly been a money maker for Queen, but it has a little cult following from what I see in the comments. I got the KS copy with the money tokens, the regular ones look crappy as F*** My favorite card drafting game and among my favorite fillers. I hear Joe Pesci's voice saying Forget about it everytime that I play this. A hidden gem.

A quick drafting game that gets some decent replayability by only using a small portion of the cards (particularly in a lower player count game).

I like that only a small subset of the common deck is used each game. This means that each game is unique as a different pool of cards is in the mix. Each game as the cards are passed players have to begin to formulate a strategy of what cards they will be looking for to wheel back around. A lot of drafting games are based on set collection, but this was based on drafting cards to create synergy. I liked that. My biggest issue with this game is a personal one and it deals with the theme. This game is about criminals doing criminal things. It has a vibe similar to the Grand Theft Auto video games. One of the vices that many of the cards portray or reference is prostitution. I know it can be seen as splitting hairs being OK with moonshine in Bootleggers, armed robbery in Cash n Guns, but have an issue with prostitution here. Maybe it is because I have read some of the horror stories of women who were rescued from that life, but the inclusion of it in this game dramatically decreases my enjoyment of it.

RATING: 8
A quick and punchy drafting game which captures a CCG-like feel in a handful of cards. While Greed may not cover new ground, it is surprisingly fun figuring out which cards can help you set up combos and which can serve as late-game finishers. Another part of its appeal lies in its ramped up level of take that elements – they're not entirely annoying, and taking note of the cards in the draft is crucial in anticipating the nastier effects. 

I only wish that the rulebook was a little more comprehensive in covering certain game situations and terminology. The other thing I'm [i]eh[/i] about is the presentation; I can take or leave the skeevy theme, but the (intentionally) kitschy graphics rubs me the wrong way.

RATING: 7
This is a super-simple, super-quick card drafting/tableau building game.  Each turn players pick one card from a stack and passes the stack to the next player.  Then, after the first two rounds in which you only select a card, you play one card.  That's essentially it for 12 rounds.  The cards come in 3 flavors.  Thugs which stay in front of you and provide symbols for playing other cards and abilities.  Holdings which are business investments.  They usually cost money to place out but can earn more than paid to play them by game end.  And finally, actions which are simply one-time use cards that don't go into your tableau.  The player with the most money at the end wins.

Now, the game plays really quickly as you can tell and I love the game space it occupies.  For a game you can teach almost anybody that plays in 15 minutes there are a decent amount of decisions here.  The cards do a whole lot of different things and there is a decent level of interaction.  You can pursue a bunch of different strategies and even read the strategy your opponents follow and counter-draft cards away from them.  There is a lot of game in this small package.

It's a drafting version of a "draw a card, play a card" game. The drafting mitigates a lot of the luck of the draw elements, but it's still not a compelling experience.

Super fast drafting game. The theme is the only thing that holds this back from me playing it with more people. Not really a game that I can bring out with certain families. But I really like the smooth gameplay and the loads of different paths to victory. The Kickstarter wooden money symbols are awesome.

Fun ideas that I thought were a nice blend of theme and mechanisms. Seemed wildly chaotic with some drop-dead POWERFUL cards. "It does THAT? Are you f**king kidding me?"

Seems like once you play a few times and recognize the kick-in-ballz combos, the game will be a race to get them set up first.

I enjoyed it. Not sure it can compete for shelf space, but I'll happily play your copy.

Oh, one last thing: I totally dig the wooden dollar markers, but I will be perfectly happy with the cardboard markers if I ever get a copy. That's the perfect Kickstarter reward -- nicer components but nothing that changes or restricts the gameplay for non-backers.

When Vaccarino debuted with [thing=36218][/thing] everyone - including me - was looking forward to what he would do next. But expecting his next games to be equally ground breaking is silly of course. I know he might surprise us again in the future, but I never go into a new game of his expecting something spectacular. And this game is not spectacular. But that's OK, not every game has to be spectacular.
Let's start with the obvious: the artwork is... not what we expect from a Queen title. Usually their titles are very nice to look at, sometimes even to the point that it hinders playability. But for the most part they are good looking and functional. Let's just say that this game is functional but not that good looking. I get what style they where after, but even then I don't find this the best version of that style I have seen. OK, to be clear: I don't like the artwork at all.
The rules for this game are quite simple. Draft cards and play one of your 3 cards in hand face down and reveal simultaneously. There are building cards on which you can put tokens worth points, there are thugs that might give you an ability but mostly icons which let you put more tokens on buildings and action cards. Everything works well and the game is highly tactical. There is a good amount of luck, but for a game that takes only 30 that is perfectly fine. It plays well and it's entertaining while it lasts. But it doesn't leave a lasting impression. It was very forgettable. The theme is pasted on and the mechanisms aren't anything we haven't seen before. It just doesn't stand out at all. And therefor my verdict is: play it if someone requests it, but why request it?

Initial rating: 6.5/10

RATING: 6
It's a bit like 7 Wonders, but with more text to read each turn, more random take-that and that annoying thing of a random selection of cards being used in each game so there's no real strategy or planning, just hoping that the cards you'll need are in play.

It's perfectly decent, but I'll stick to 7 Wonders; that just feels infinitely more elegant.

A solid filler primarily focused on the card drafting mechanic. Being as you see all the cards that will be available for the game within the first 2 turns, it rewards ling term planning and allows for your opponent to potentially ruin your day if you don't get the card you need early enough.

Greed is a puffball of a drafting game.  It's an artful retheme of four decades worth of television crime show tropes.  There's no blood, no gore; it is essentially a Disney (I mean Queen) attempt at a crime game.  Too rulesy for the experience.

RATING: 7
Picked this up on sale for $15 and thought "how bad could it be?" Well, not bad at all really. Other than Dominion this has to be the designer's best game (Kingdom Builder is incredibly overrated). It's just 7 Wonders (or more similar to Sushi Go/Fairy Tale since it's just cards) but with one slight change that makes a huge difference: you have your own personal hand of cards from which you play.

Meaning that you do a card draft like in the other games, but the card you drafted gets added to your hand of personal cards instead of being played immediately. You then play any one of the cards from your personal hand. This means that the game is really about setting up combos, finding cards that work well together, and trying to execute your plans before the game ends. This really gives the game a different feel and makes it stand out from the other drafting games.

The game doesn't work with two players despite what BGG's player count poll suggests. A lot of cards are really dependent on you getting other cards, and with just two players it's likely that the right cards won't even be in the game. I've played with four players and that seems to be optimal: there are plenty of different cards getting passed around.

Really happy with this game for now.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 3+[/b]
Haven't played this with too many player counts yet so I'm not sure what's best, but the game just doesn't work with 2. Most of the cards rely on other cards being in play in order to score/activate. With only two players you have very few cards in play, so a lot of cards would just be useless right away and the game would lost any tension.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Greed is one of the finest drafting games out there.  It is perfectly balanced, plays quickly and has just enough heft, while working well at all player counts.  It helps to know the cards, but with only 80 in total, it is far from a daunting task - and there is variability in that many cards are unused every game. Highly recommend!

Better with more plays,  really fun drafting game, with good strategies and interaction.  Really like this one, expansions will be cool.  I wish KS had offered some as stretch goals.

Update -  just bumped GREED from an 8 to a 9, Because, I am already begging for expansions! I can only think of all the cool upgrades... Bosses, more thugs, on and on.  I am sure they strategically held back, which almost makes me want to drop my rating to a 7, because the game replay value is getting a bit scary after a bunch of plays, and I feel like the game is not complete.  But I am a sucker for drafting games, and the game is super fun.

RATING: 7
Greed is fun! Rather, the game is fun. Of the several drafting card games I own, I consider Greed the best among the lot (Sushi Go! 7 Wonders, Fairy Tale). Sushi Go caters to a lighter audience while 7 Wonders is a hit or miss and have way too many scoring categories and icons. I like 7 Wonders but always hesitate to bring out the game with newbies. Greed comes somewhere in between. It is medium weight as far as card games go because of the card text. Yet, the game play is simple to teach and play.

The game focuses on getting the most money and assets through 10 rounds of card play. Part of the delight in this game is that the card combos are unique and can be chained together for maximum effects This means a modicum of planning is necessary to set up a cash or asset engine. However the strength of the game is also its weakness. On the one hand, card combos are unique and will vary from game to game, introducing variability and some unpredictability. However, to play well and to see the possibilities, one has to play several hands to get a good feel for the cards. Luckily, there are only three card types in the box. So learning all the rules for these card types won't be tough. Still, Greed suffers like all other games with card drafting mechanisms: cards that go around may not come around. You can plan as much as you can, but with more players, good cards are unlikely to around. This can be frustrating. With 2 players, the card pool is small and so your tactic must change. However, you can reasonably plan a strategy which you can execute. In fact I would argue that most card drafting games should be 2-4 player counts at most. 

Good game, certainly an underrated gem as far as card games go and criminally under advertised and under promoted by Queen Games. Grab them for ($10 or less!).

Fine drafting game - nothing terribly special.  Feels not entirely polished, especially with the card timings existing in the form they do (when they almost never matter).

It could likely be cleaned up and made a better, more streamlined game, but what's there is enjoyable enough.

Bought this because I love drafting games, but 7 Wonders always just feels too convoluted to me.  Scoring is too hard to keep track of, no interaction.  I wanted a game with more interaction and Greed sounded like the answer.  There is interaction but it's not really the fun kind, it's usually just blanket "every other player loses x", which tends to piss every one else off and isn't necessarily fun.  I'm not against being mean in games but I at least like to feel accomplishment from it, not just because I played a card on a whim.

A Donald X. Vaccharino game with some theme?  Will somebody please check the temperature in hell?

This is not the deepest game, but finally Vaccharino exhibits something that is not the tired "tweak the rules of the base game with a random set of cards or tiles" a la [gameid=36218] or [gameid=107529] or the lesser tripe he's put out.

It's also, not coincidentally, his freshest design since Dominion.  It's not that it's groundbreaking, exactly, as the drafting mechanic has been around for years and has been done in exemplary fashion by [gameid=68448], but Greed is a well-done game, and there's variety and interesting decisions packed in a game that doesn't take very much time.  The art style is great, reminiscent of the Grand Theft Auto series of videogames.  Don't expect this game to become the fixture of your game night, but it's not a bad choice for filler.

Playing this made me realize just how much more I would have liked 7 Wonders had it used text based abilities rather than arcane symbols. Aside from ease of use, text offers much more interesting combos and effects. I also find the Reservoir Dogs style theme to be both unique and appealing. As I sort of alluded to above, game play is the same as 7 Wonders. Draft a card, play a card, pass your hand.

The locations, missions and card effects do a great job of telling a pretty interesting story as you build your tableau. I think that's the primary reason I like it so much better than the game from which it is so clearly derived.

Mature themed (think GTA) card game as crime lords use action, location, and thug cards to build the most wealth. Unique mechanic where game is played with the initial 12 card draw divvied in a card draft. Thinky and AP prone right off the bat, looking at 12 cards and pick one, look at 11 cards and pick one while remembering combo possibilities from your original 12, repeat for three rounds, then play a card while drafting for the rest. Very clever but complete brain melt especially with more players. Good memory and players that know the cards have a distinct advantage. Not a gateway.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Not really a bad game but the artwork didn't really get me hooked and other games do the card draft/combos better. This is unique in that (at least at 3P) you don't see all of the cards so each game could be quite different. Still, I'd turn to other combo drafters (Fairy Tale or my personal favorite, 7 Wonders) if I wanted to scratch this itch.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great drafting game with lots of fun combos to try out and get creative with. I find it interesting that there's often no one "best" card in a hand. Lots of cards can be powerful based on the other cards you've played so I feel like the game rewards making a good general plan rather than picking up individually powerful effects. Another hit for Donald X.

A Donald X filler game that I really like (quite an achievement for him as I'm lukewarm ton his other offerings). I like a good draft anyway, and this game is all about the draft. A bit of screwage and trying to come up with combos and you've got a winner in my eyes

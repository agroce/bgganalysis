Really surprised by the great design here. Deep but streamlined, a hallmark in design, the best Winsome title I've played perhaps and perhaps the most challenging and rewarding investment game experience for the time required to play. Every bit as good as Chicago Express.

A stock game that actually feels like you are helping to building a company from the ground up. Players bid on stock. The winner's bid goes into that company as money they can spend to expand out their railroads with. It's nice that in this game, the money you used to bid doesn't just disappear down a black hole; you actually get to use that money to continue strengthening that company. Another interesting thing was each round, player ordered was determined by drawing from a bag. The person in first place only has one token in the bag, second place has two tokens in the bag, and so on. So last place player is most likely to have multiple turns and someone in first has a very low chance of having a turn. The bag drawing is done at the end of each round.

The first time I played this game, one player had gotten into the lead for income and had bought one of almost every kind of stock. She never got another turn in the game after the second round, but ended up winning because she had stock in everything. While that was a frustrating experience, it was definitely the fault of us [the other players] for letting her win all of those stock bids so early on in the game.

I want ever so much to give German Railways an 8 (very good) or higher! But at the moment it's stuck at a 7 (good) for me because of that danged turn order mechanic. Supposedly, clever investing can counterbalance getting few "action" turns. But when several rounds go by where cannot act in any other way than participate in auctions other people start, it can be kind of aggravating. I wish the game was less randomly determined through turn order.

However! I really like the rest of the game. The train mechanics, special abilities of the companies, 3 stocks per company, etc. It's a fun design with a wacky turn order bit.

The heart of German Railways and what makes it significantly different from Chicago Express is the randomized turn order mechanism.  I understand its cleverness in forcing the leader to make the most of very limited opportunities, while offering those trailing chances to catch up.  However, in practice it results in players sitting out turns and getting bored. 

I think that the big board with mostly one point income cities doesn't help either.  Development seems very incremental.  The design is even at pains to make Berlin, the one high value location, accessible to many companies.  Blocking is possible but rarely seems significant.  The bottom line for me is whether I would ever play this game in preference to Chicago Express or American Rails?  My answer: no.

The Queen production is slightly disappointing, with generic share certificates in easily confused colours and information about the companies' special powers only to be found in the rules.  The rules themselves are well written.

Initial: Learning game with 2 friends took 3+ hours, by the end the devious nature of the game became more apparent. The game relies on collusion and temporary alliances.  This element is the true beauty of the game.  The unusual weighted and stochastic turn order mechanism leads to a  degree of uncertainty in the company share auctions, which I think helps avoid AP (analysis paralysis).  So overall the game has some cool design elements.  Still gauging how much 'fun' it is.

One frustrating usability defect of the game is that the board doesn't bother to list the special abilities of the 8 companies or include player cards with that information.  For a rather expensive game that is a rather glaring design mistake.

[ESP] Nuestra primera partida fue incompleta. No llevábamos ni la mitad del juego cuando nos dimos cuenta que ya no tenía sentido seguir jugando. Un jugador (yo) escapado a la cabeza, mientras que otro (DB) no podía hacer nada siquiera para intentar alcanzarnos. A pesar de estar muuuy por detrás en sus posibles dividendos su ficha para jugar casi ni se vió en el OT. Algo anda mal con este juego, al menos con 5 jugadores.... Por el momento no puedo recomendarlo...

The turn order mechanic is wonderful, but only once you realize that not getting turns is not the worst thing that can happen to you, so long as you're able to invest wisely.  Still much more chaotic than other Winsome games, however.

Heavier-weight Chicago Express.  Variable player powers which all seem pretty even and interesting.  Highly variable turn order determination, which is probably the dominating feature of the game.  Everyone that played liked it, enough that I picked up a copy (via the Chicago Express expansion Kickstarter).

+ Fascinating and bold. My favourite game in the genre, easy to teach, quite complicated to master.
- While the turn order trick is awesome, in some situations it can eliminate a player during the first turns. That stops this game from becoming a 10.

While similar mechanistically to Chicago Express, this is a completely different game.

This game is a little more forgiving than CE, or at least seems so to players in trouble, due to the anti-runaway turn order thing, but early game that mechanism is as sometimes disastrously grainy luck prone as Settlers.

This game is also more fiddly and clunky mechanically than CE, and gets decreasing play for train game sittings.

I have an issue with the turn selection mechanism.  I agree that on average it should be OK, but in our 4-player game last night, my wife led almost from start to finish, but probably only had ~5 turns in the entire game.  She won by a healthy margin, but was absolutely bored to tears.

Strange game, very strange game. Sometimes in a whole round, a player is not able to play. This looks like a real disadvantage, but it has not to be one because that player can buy a share on a other players turn.
I must admit I liked it, but will it be like that after a few more plays?
Second play : It's certainly a good game, but it's hard to find the right strategy. Because I like it, I raised my score to 8.

Liked it better than I thought I would because of the randomness.

As predicted, it seems that actually getting a turn isn't very important as long as you manage your opportunities properly.

That said, it still is a pain when you have four cubes in there and don't get a single one pulled - particularly early game.

I think Wabash is the better game.  This, however, did have a few interesting aspects, and I'm looking forward to playing it again.

The aspect that bugged me most in last night's game was that the first dividend took so long, and we were buying shares for $3.  After dividends started happening, we were buying shares for $45!  It'll take another game or two to see if this trend continues occurring - if so, it's not a trend I like.

The randomness still...just bothers me.  It comes out in far too many games as a large factor in the result.

8-11-09:

The randomness kills the game for me; it plays kingmaker too much in the game.  I would rate it much lower if I didn't perceive the game as a good "introduction" to the 'cube rails' series, thus making it more accessible (and of course because of the strong mechanics that otherwise underlie the game!).  As a whole, just not my favorite of the series by far.

Another neat stock train game.  I like some of the mechanisms and the benefits of the different companies. However, I feel like the turn-taking mechanism is a bit too random for this game.  In our game, how the turns were randomly selected on the last move determined that I won the game.  It feels like too much randomness for a somewhat calculating game.  I did enjoy the play.

One of the best (if not the best) stock shares train games in the Chicago Express vein.

Please, don't turn down when you read the complains about the action allowance/turn order mechanic. I never felt that was problematic, more over I think it's a very clever idea.

Played a 4 player game, my first, with 3 that had played before.  A lot going on here with the variability of the turn order.  I ended up winning with some very lucky turn orders as I was in the lead.  My first stock purchase was for black as a long term company.  Then I bought into yellow early for capital/cash.  I was able to diversify quite well with a total monopoly of black in the late end of the game.  Several turns in the second half of the game I was able to let other player in companies give me money while I was able to concentrate on black.  The game was very close up to the end, but at the very end of the game black was able to merge 3 times at the end of the game and I pulled away from the other 3 players.  My total was about $740 and I won by well over $200.

Overall a very fun game that is a step up in difficulty from Chicago Express.

Very good game!  This may replace Chicago Express as my favorite Winsome (though CE will still probably continue to be more played because it's easier to understand).  The mechanics are a little odd (end game condition, turn order), but not hard to understand.  The end game ran a little long.  I like that all companies have 3 shares.  The special powers for companies are a little much to remember and a player aid would have been helpful.  The number of dividends that will occur are hard to figure out but critical to doing well.  I don't feel like the game pace is as easy to manipulate as CE.  Definitely want to play this one more.

At first the different railroad company abilities don't seem to matter too much. More shares is better, higher-value shares are better. But the different abilities shape the development of the various companies, allowing them different opportunities at those higher share values. It's interesting.

Rating this game is hard after only one play. Seems to be rather harsh economic train game where a bad move ruins the rest of the game completely. Mechanic for turn order is interesting but adds a luck element in the game and those who don't like luck might dislike also this.

RATING: 7
German Railways is pretty typical Winsome stuff.  Buy shares of train companies which fund those companies' expansion, and receive dividend payouts from your investments according to how well the companies expanded.

However, there are a few unique qualities to this game.  The first is that each rail company has a different unique ability.  Some can build more trains per turn, whereas others are limited.  Some can build more cheaply.  All have unique abilities that must be taken into account when deciding your investments.

The other interesting element is turn order.  Each round, everyone puts markers into a bag depending on the current worth of their investments.  The less worth you have, the more markers you put into the bag.  Then, 5 markers are drawn for the current round (one for each game turn in a round).  The markers drawn indicate who will take turns in the round.  So, some rounds might feature one player getting more than one turn, whereas another player might not get a turn at all!  While some people might absolutely hate this randomness, I really enjoyed it since it added some unpredictability to the game.  You can position yourself as best as possible, but luck can still play a small role.

Overall, pretty standard Winsome train games fare with a few neat twists that make it a very good game.

I thoroughly enjoyed this one.  It takes longer than Wabash or Age of Scheme, but it's very interesting.  I'm sure you could get a really wonky game on occasion due to the turn order mechanism, though.  But that's no different than, say, Settlers where you can have a game where your numbers never roll.

RATING: 10
(Reviewed Fall 2010)German Railways, available at Essen this year, is a gussied up edition of Preussische Ostbahn, a small-run title from Winsome, a boutique designer of (almost) exclusively train games and devilishly interesting ones at that. Besides the nice board and bits and the more pronounceable name, nothing has changed since the 2008 release. This license continues a relationship between Winsome and Queen that began with the 2008 release of Chicago Express, a high-end production of 2007’s Wabash Cannonball, and most recently bore fruit in the form of Samarkand: Routes to Riches, a reworking of the 2008 (very limited) release of Age of Scheme.

Like Chicago Express, German Railways maintains an identical ruleset to its Winsome forebear.* Many comparisons have been made between Chicago Express and German Railways, but they are all quite superficial or merely highlight the contrasts as there are few substantive similarities. This review will not draw such contrasts and will assume no knowledge of Chicago Express - a very worthy game in its own right.

The rules for German Railways are quite simple. The goal is to have the most cash in the end. Cash is made during dividend phases in which players are paid for shares held in the eight (or nine and soon to be ten) railway companies. These dividends are triggered for all companies when any two companies connect to each other for the first time (i.e. everyone gets paid when a new unique connection is made). Players, on their turn**, can either issue a share to be auctioned or, using the company treasury, expand a company that they have a share in. This latter choice - expansion - can increase company income as the company services additional cities. The game usually ends when all companies have touched at least two other companies. Sound simple? Well, there are a few little twists to the rules that add a lot of spice to this seemingly bland recipe.

There is no stock dilution. Any share that is issued will pay whatever the company’s current income is. Without the reduced income that dilution brings, partnerships (the bread and butter of nearly all shareholding games) can be particularly fruitful.

There are only three shares of each railroad and they are only available in ‘tiers’. The first of each is auctioned before the start of the game. Only once all the first tier shares are sold does the second tier become available. And only once all the second tier shares are sold do the third tier shares become available. This tends to create an interesting arc to the game where the initial auction sets the stage, the second tier (which is almost always available after the initial auction) is strategically auctioned during the first half of the game to create relatively exclusive cross-ownership patterns and - hopefully -beneficial alliances, and the third tier throws the second tier alliances out the window, making the endgame a banquet of alliance management possibilities.

Valuations at the three tiers are also totally distinct. The first is predicated on player count and starting cash, distribution of prior purchases in the initial round, and, essentially, price/value enforcement. The second two tier values are situational, predicated on player cash, player income, the existing alliance structure, and how players would like to manipulate that structure. Besides the challenge of valuation, the issue of which share to put up for auction and when are intensely difficult and fascinating decisions.

The company that makes the connection gets a double dividend per share (while every other company will pay a regular dividend). This little gem of a mechanism can generate very powerful alliances when incentives are closely aligned or it can spawn all sorts of extortive possibilities. The connection double-dividend can just be hanging there, but why use your turn to take it when you could improve your income on another share and let your ‘partner’ connect, giving you the double payout AND the increased income from the other share? This is particularly potent if the next player in line can steal the double dividend. Your partner’s got to make the connection, because if he doesn’t ...

There is an alternative endgame condition, namely that if it can be proved that the primary condition CANNOT ever be met, the game ends immediately. This gives the owners of certain geographically marginal companies added control of how many dividends may or may not pay out. As with many Winsome games where cash on hand at the end of the game is victory points, game-end timing is at the core of the game. So control of that timing - even partial control or the threat of control one of the conditions - is a valuable thing indeed.

Berlin is like a roach motel: They check in, but they don’t check out. Each company (in the base game) is allowed only one approach to Berlin. Functionally, this means that once entered, Berlin cannot be passed through. This tends to make Berlin a hub of connection. Since connections drive the primary end-game trigger, whether players drive (or have the ability to drive) companies to Berlin or not has significant consequences on game-end timing.

The board is divided into ‘city’ and ‘rural’ hexes. The former allow any number of companies to enter. The latter only allow one. This leads to very aggressive blocking patterns as players try to ensure double-dividends for their companies or deny connectivity to others - particularly in the central cluster.

Each company has a special characteristic. Some companies have certain advantages, some have certain disadvantages. This particular aspect gives the decisions a much richer texture and, ultimately, changes the shape of the game as some companies end up being ‘early’ companies, some ‘late’, some ‘income’ companies, some ‘connector’ companies.

Finally, there is the turn order. Oh for the love of God! The turn order! What a lovely and innovative mechanism. Earlier, I mentioned that the two things a player can do on their turn are put a share up for auction from the available tier or expand a company in which they have a share. But turns DO NOT go around the table. They DO NOT go in order of cash - ascending or descending. They DO NOT go in company order. So, how do they go?

The player or players with the greatest total income (i.e. the sum of the income track values of all their held shares) take one of their player cubes and put it in a cup. The player or players with second most put two cubes in a cup. The third put in three. Fourth, four. Fifth five. Then, a cube is drawn randomly from the cup and placed in the first turn order position. Then another is drawn and put into second. Then third. And so on until there are cubes equal to the number of players. All other cubes are returned to the players. Each player with a cube in the turn order track takes a turn in order. Then the whole process is repeated until one of the endgame conditions is met.

Translation: If you have the highest income in a five-player game, you will contribute one cube out of a likely 15 or so (the number can vary depending on ties in income since tied players put in the same number). Five cubes will be drawn from those 15 to determine turn order for the next round. There is a two in three chance that you do not have a turn this round. None. No turn.

Stay in first and its likely to happen again.

Alternatively, in last place, you would have an 92% chance of getting one of your five cubes pulled. Note also, that in last position, you have a good chance of having multiple cubes pulled.

This mechanism has several critical effects on gameplay. Valuation of share purchases is dependent not on the company’s current potential, but its potential once the new turn order probabilities are established. A partnership between the top two income leaders is often not that effective since turns will not be that abundant. But a partnership between the top and bottom can be a disaster as well since the income laggard may want to increase income on other lines in an effort to catch up rather than trigger double dividends which can often just put him farther behind. (That is, if the doubled dividend isn’t large enough to cover the income gap.)
This mechanism indeed adds an element of randomness to the game. And it can be devastating - I’ve seen one player pull all four of their cubes in a four-player game. But it turns the game into an absolutely amazing and imprecise exercise in risk management, incentive manipulation, and... dare I say it about a Winsome train game... fun.


*Purists will note there was a dividend rounding difference between CE and WC.
**See further on for details on WHEN you get a turn. Mwahahaha!

(Updated 8/28/09 after 3 plays.) My rating of this skyrockets from a 7 to a 9 after a couple more plays. My initial impression that self-interest was too murky to lead to meaningful control of incentives has proven to be false. The game is fragile, yes, but not so fragile that committed players can’t make it beautiful. Incentives – real or perceived – can be discerned and therefore meaningfully created. Game end control is possible, but difficult and partial. Valuation then becomes possible, but fraught with peril. The turn-order mechanism is NOT broken but beautiful. It adds a delicious layer of complexity and risk management to the purchase of shares since you are not just buying an income stream at a value predicated on your game length, but you are often hobbling your direct control over the game length by lowering your chances of getting a turn. The spatial and ‘special’ characteristics of the companies make for very interesting dynamics indeed. They seem to be at the heart of game length control. I look forward to experimenting more with their interactions. Overall, this is a game that takes over my brain for days after playing. A very good thing.

Original comment: The other day, I trapped a hornet between the screen and the window. I just watched his futile thrashing back and forth – window to screen, screen to window. Later, I came back and he was dead. After playing my first game of PO, I now know how he felt. Nothing I seemed to be able to do would improve my position. I’ve played plenty of non-intuitive, opaque, and –some might say- fragile games, but this one pushes the boundaries of my tolerance. Even a table full of competitive, intelligent gamers doesn’t guarantee a ‘good’ game as the dynamics are so volatile that a game can easily go to the beneficiary of another player’s mistake without anyone at the table even realizing what happened. The problem seems to lie with the fact that you need to engender situations through building, buying, bidding, or selling that create incentives for other players to improve your position. However, understanding what your own incentives are is difficult. Guessing what your opponents will think is in their best interest is considerably more so. How will this game stand up to differing player experience levels? Can the ‘best’ player win at a table full of newbies that don’t know what is good for them? I am very curious to see what happens.

RATING: 9
Tentative rating after three 5 player games and two 3 player games.  3 player is probably better for teaching but the game scales surprisingly well across player counts.

There's a lot to this game, far more than meets the eye.  It is most certainly neither light or fluffy.  I do not understand it well enough to comment well but I am impressed with the game.

Updated: 9 plays now.  There's a lot more here than I first thought, more than easily meets the eye.  It is a tough fight for me as to which of Pampas Railroads and Preußische Ostbahn I prefer.  It is such a very good and meaty game.  Unlike Wabash the fight isn't for incentive, but the for the opportunity to affect the incentive structures.  The low income players court the high income player's cash holdings and the high income players weed and herd the low income players via precise bidding and careful positioning to help them win.  It is a delightful dance.

RATING: 7
First reaction from the hip: it's another Winsome game, and at this point I know the drill -- simple ruleset that masks brain-melting complexity in action. Hints at black-belt level shenanigans I don't have the skill set to pull off. Our naive white-belt post game analysis indicates that it is possible -- unlikely but possible -- that the chit pull turn order system (innovative in this context, but I've dabbled in enough war games that this is not my first rodeo there) can just royally screw you over with no hope of recovery.

Net net: I think there's layers to this onion, and I'm by no means counting out the possibility that this game can really worm its way into my heart. But I'm not there yet.

Not factored into the score but worth a mention: not 100% on board with Queen's graphic re-design, and this comes from a guy who thinks Queen did a great job with Chicago Express and (to an extent) Locomotive Werks and just finished vocally defending the Mayfair reprint of 1830, so this isn't "REAL TRAIN GAMERS ONLY LIKE BUTT-UGLY UTILITARIAN GRAPHICS" reverse snobbery talking. The trains are distinguishable enough but the palette-swapped single graphic design of every share was a profoundly misguided choice particularly in light of the fact that the black and brown shares are difficult to tell apart, and the red-orange-yellow shares are more of a continuum than distinct hues. Bad form.

Question to ask yourself: when you first play a game, do you enjoy the feeling of internalizing a fairly straightforward rule set, almost immediately feeling a sinking feeling of being almost immediately behind the 8-ball, heaving a sigh, and saying "what the hell do I do now?" If so, this is the game for you.

[url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/345977]Reviewed[/url].

If there's a more interesting 3p auction on the market, I haven't seen it. This isn't a game about 'alliances' or 'collusion' in the Wabash tradition. It's about exploitation and (to borrow a word) temptation. Five-player games are somewhat (though not much more) chaotic. They're also brutal: every auction is incredibly high-stakes, every wrong bet crippling.

High scores have been ballooning, along with stock prices. I wonder how much higher bidding can really go, though. Right now, they're maxing out around $55. At the point where players can spend that kind of money on a piece of stock, a bid really has two values: the dollar price, and an unspoken opportunity cost in actions. Figuring out the dollar price is almost trivial: it will make more money than you can possibly bid on it until very late in the game. How much can you afford yet remain competitive in auctions until the next dividend? In dollar terms, it's probably worth that. On the other hand, opportunity costs are real and huge in this game, and might pull share prices down.

Can you win without ever taking a turn? Probably not, but you can absolutely win without taking very many. Your cube does not need to get pulled in order for you to participate in and greatly influence the partner-shopping around which this title revolves.
-----
Amazing game about encouraging your opponents to run your rails for you. Play each turn as if you won't have another one for three rounds, because you might not. If your cube doesn't get pulled, you can't expand any of your railroads. So what? If your game depends on your cube getting pulled, you'll lose. Having a lot of turns is nice because you've got a lot of control, but if the other players are doing their job right, you can't help but make them rich too (see also Imperial, 1860).

Great opportunities for defensive play; one wonders if Mr. Wu's original design was in fact themed around weeds and not railroading. Age of Kudzu? Gardening through Germany?

Tip for board comprehension (useful for your first couple of games only): when a company is connected to one other railway, rotate its sold and unsold stock by 90 degrees. When it's connected to two or more, flip its shares upside down.

Some interesting strategy based around extremely limited resources, but the randomness of turns (turn tokens are put in the bag, players adding possibly up to 5 tokens) means you could be sitting around doing nothing for quite a while.  Dragged a bit, though part of this was due to all new players.

Incredible.  Superior to Chicago Express, though, it certainly takes a few games in order for players to realize what is going on under the hood.  Initially I had several problems (runaway leader, too much randomness, among them), but every problem has been mitigated by player experience.  Now I just need to paint some trains and draw up a new map in photoshop...

Update:  Still exploring this game.  I don't know if I'll ever figure out how this monster works, but its great fun to attempt to do so.

The game [i]is[/i] the turn order mechanism...methinks Winsome was trying to beat the alliance idea into people's heads with this game, and they apparently failed to do so!

PO is another game in the Historic Railways System, and seems more closely related to Wabash than the other 2008 entry, Gulf, Mobile & Ohio. PO has the familiar company kitties and more importantly, also centres on alliances, to a new mind-boggling degree. Stocks do not dilute in this, but too much income can also saddle players with a high probability of not directly controlling actions because they will not get their own turns (i.e.: companies they are running by themselves will languish, stocks only they want put up will likely collect dust until they absolutely have to be sold to access the next layer). The turn order mechanism is the heart of the game, and managing it is the key to doing well. Players with a lot of income will be able to win shares easily (and likely end up in alliances with other players as a result) but they will not get to control companies directly. Unlike Wabash, shares do not dilute, so there is no disincentive at all to get partners in this aside from the desire to pull away from certain competition.

Having control of actions can function as a catch-up mechanism, or as a way to balance the power of having high income because it is easier to be the one who connects to other companies, which initiates dividends and double-payment for the connecting company. However, cagey investors can often be involved in the companies getting the double dividends without ever having to build the track themselves. This is a game where playing the turn order via smart stock purchases and sales is absolutely crucial, players who do not do this will likely spend the game without actions and with no one having any incentive to help them out.

Like Gulf, the track building also has considerable latitude for defensive and offensive plays because of the large number of rural hexes where only one piece can be built. This makes it easy to snooker certain companies, making it very hard for them to be the initiator of a double dividend. Also be very cautious with the companies that limit track either via the money model ($5 max) or the track (2 track)...it is very easy to make stupid mistakes running these companies when you are first sitting down to the game.

The tight rope in this game is one of income versus control. Players with low income should get more turns which means people should want to partner with them so they can reap some of the double dividends that the low incomers will be generating. I also try to stress to players in the early going that you want to get partners as soon as humanly possible in this game if you're in the top spot or two in the income track or if you plan to be at any point. People with high income will not get turns regularly for the most part and need to play assuming they aren't going to. Yes, you can win this game not taking very many turns, trust me. I do understand why people find it frustrating to not get turns in the first round or two of the game, because that tends to be when you can float your own shares and get friends who will help you when you're not having your cubes drawn, but that's why the initial shares are auctioned off. If you really want to make sure you can go early, and you really think that's important, all you have to do is sandbag your income.

For my tastes, probably best with 3 just because even the player with the lead in income will still have a decent odds of getting 1 turn at least every couple of rounds while the other players often get doubles, but I can see the charm of playing it with 4 for even more emphasis on the alliance structure. The interesting thing is that with more players, the likelihood of late players getting double turns goes up significantly, which has an interesting impact. The turn order is most under control with 3, but the stock holding patterns are also a little less interesting, as 8 companies and 3 players means there is a tonne of overlap. More players at the table means this is spread out more and high/low income alliances between pairs of players would be more possible. 

I will say one final thing: if you "fix" the turn order in this you are not playing PO anymore, it [i]is[/i] the game, if you don't like that, you probably should just get rid of the game and stick to something like Age of Scheme. I find this game nice for a change of pace. It won't get the play that Wabash, Age of Scheme or Gulf do, but I do think it's another fun alternative and would have no problem playing this at any given gaming session.

Not quite as beloved to me as Chicago Express, but dang it's close. If you play with the right mindset and the right people, the whole random draw will-I-get-a-turn-or-won't-I aspect can actually be really fun strategically. Now, if people aren't well prepared for that, they can really sulk over lost turns and "unfair" randomness. This one is right up there with Chicago Express and even sometimes edges it out for what I want to play more. Ultimately I haven't been able to play that often and I'm dying to bring it to the table more often. I think it's a step beyond Chicago Express and doesn't work for the majority of my entry level gaming friends and neighbors. 

Oh and another side note, I printed some aids to help decipher all of the different company abilities. I love that part of this game from a strategic standpoint, oh so many variables to consider (and they seem to be pretty balanced). BUT, the colors are too similar and the print is TINY and man oh man those German names are brutal. I like the authenticity of the original German names but I wish they could somehow improve the ergonomics of the game in that one major aspect.

We all absolutely hated the turn order mechanic.  Though it is statistically unlikely, it is still possible (and in fact happened) that our last place player got no turn 3 turns in a row.  We aborted at that point.

I think this may be fixable by instead having each player have one turn but having the last place player designate where in the turn order he wishes to be and so on.  Another option is to have one more turn than the number of players and the last place player gets this turn.  But as is, it is too fragile.

This is very similar to Chicago Express.  In fact, I rate the games the same.  However, German Railways is more fun to play.  I'm not sure whether it is...maybe the turn order angst or the non-devaluation of stock or the special ability of each railway.  But it just feels cleaner and more interesting.

The only reason I don't rate it higher is that it seems to have a runaway leader issue.  This is my take after a single play.  It just seems that if a player makes a mistake or two early, they can get crushed in terms of not making any money to buy more stock.  I think if that had happened to me, I might have rated it a 5.

German Railways is my latest, and perhaps my last, purchase of a Winsome game. This is not because I dislike German Railways or find the particular Winsome style of game to be frustrating, but simply because German Railways is such an excellent implementation of the style of games that Winsome produces that I like that I feel little need to continue their purchases further. It takes all of the incentive management of Chicago Express and German Railways and pushes it up a notch creating a game that is slightly less fragile and twice as evocative.

Unfortunately the color and component choices for the Queen version are awful. They really should have included a player aid with the different railroad abilities and I frequently have to ask other people at the table what color different stocks are.

Players acquire shares in early German railroads, expands the railroads across the map, and "merge" them into other railroads to trigger dividend payouts.  Mechanically simple game.  On your turn you can either pass, auction of the of the 24 available shares in the game, or expand a railroad you already have a share in.  Shares payout when a railroad connects to another railroad in a city for the first time, with the moving railroad getting a double payout.  Game ends when every railroad has connected to at least two others, and most cash wins.  Interesting game in the Chicago Express family - the turn order system is very odd, but didn't bother me too much, as you can still participate in auctions.  Still, it's annoying to not be able to move your railroads to get the double payout simply by turn order draw luck.  Intriguing game, but not a patch on American Rails, the current king of the hill.

RATING: 7
Can't decide how i feel about this game: the rules are simple enough with just enough chrome to make it interesting (unlike Chicago Express, each railway has a small change to the rules to make them truly different) and it does speed along rather quickly.
On the other hand, the mechanism to determine player order is rather... odd. Depending on your standing on the victory track, you get 1,2,3 or 4 tokens in the bag. Now, having more tokens does not guarantee that you'll go first or even that you will have a turn but rather simply increase your odds. it is entirely possible that you will not have a proper go for a turn or even several in a row. If this bothers you, then the game is not for you. It is rather like sitting on the sidelines in 18XX, looking at other players direct their railroads while you collect money.
This being said, there are rather interesting twists and strategies to be found in this game.
Must play again to come up with a real evaluation.

IMPORTANT RULE TO REMEMBER:
If any one company can be demonstrably unable to get two mergers, the game ends (yes, even if other companies still can; and *even if this company can still get one*). {Rules clarified by designer in a thread}

RULES ERRATA: 
1. Berlin is a plains space. We played it wrong, because of the bad board colors.
2. Rules should say "The Badische may place one rural track (of its 3 allowed track) per Expansion for free." {this is instead of it's power listed now}

TIMESAVING FORMULA:
Merging company's payout = Player income + ((Company income) * (Players # of shares)). This formula is correct. Stop questioning it, other players. 

NOTE TO SELF (use strategy, damn it!): When having the best income, the (Basic) auction break-point formula = # of mergers remaining in game * company current value, {unless company income can go up a lot}, DO NOT PAY MORE THAN THIS. Using end-early rule, players can still make this break-point too large by reducing # of future mergers, emphasizing even more: DO NOT PAY MORE THAN THIS. If you do not have best income, is okay to overbid if you can sucker the higher-income player into overbidding.

This is a game with a lot of luck and a lot of skill.  It should be a game I like.  However, it too easily puts players into a position where their only function is to be kingmakers, and it asks them to do that for a long time.  I only played the game once, took a chance that failed, and, after some thought, decided to pass for the rest of the game rather than be a kingmaker.  This seems entirely unsatisfactory.  I don't mind a game in which I am eliminated from contention, but I want to have something to do while I wait for the winner to be determined.

Another issue is that, when playing face-to-face, the game is fiddly.  It's easy to make mistakes.  I was playing with people who had each played multiple games, and they found it hard to keep the game accurate.

And finally (sorry if I'm piling on,) the graphics in the Queen edition, which we were using, are poor.  It's hard to tell the brown shares from the black shares and the yellow shares from the orange shares.  It really shouldn't be that hard to find 8 distinguishable colors.  I suspect the Winsome version had better graphics, and perhaps I'd rate that a point higher.

Because I enjoy some other Queen train games like Paris Connection and Chicago Express, I had high hopes. Well, this feels like another of the same type train game, only with a bunch of extra math. Also, each color train has a special rule, but there is no handy handout included, so you have to keep the rule book out and try not to forget the rules.

All in all, it's a good enough game, but it involves too much math. Also, I think this game will take a few times to really figure out a decent strategy - in other words, you can only play a real game if everyone involved has a few games under their belts.

German Railways is yet another investment train game. I'd say it feels a little bit like a cross between Chicago Express and Samarkand, being a little more open and less opaque than the former and adopting a modified version of inter-company connections from the latter.

The turn order mechanic is stupendously simple, and works surprisingly well. In short, players with high income are much less likely to get any actions at all while players with low income can often get several actions in per turn. Key for the leading players therefore is to create a setup that incentivizes other players to choose actions that will benefit them as well.

My favorite Winsome that I've played to date. Very similar to AoScheme but simply better in every way. What really makes this better than the other Winsomes is the turn order mechanism. I'm still wondering what this turn order mechanism is doing in a Winsome, but it is a beautiful implementation that really shakes up the hornets' nest. Not for the feint of heart or for people that don't like dealing with probability. This one has a unique feel that sets it apart from other Winsomes, and so it goes up to an 8 because it melds strategy with probability with fun with tactical recalculation for the present turn while keeping future events somewhat obscure.

Es in juego de trenes que originariamente salió por Winsome Games en el que tenemos que comprar acciones de 8 compañías alemanas y operarlas para ser el jugador con mas pasta al final del juego.

Iniciamos la partida después de 45 minutos de prejuicios sobre su mecánica y desarrollo, cuando llegamos a la conclusión de que para poder reseñar y hablar con propiedad del juego tendríamos que jugarlo nos pusimos a ello e iniciamos la partida.

Los componentes son correctos, pero hay un par de cosas en el diseño que joroban bastante, la primera es que hay colores muy similares siendo el naranja y el amarillo el mas conflictivo para mi, las tarjetas de acciones son muy bonitas, pero podían haber utilizado un cartón de naipe en vez del papel guarro que traen y lo peor de todo: al principio hay que estar mirando continuamente una página de las reglas donde vienen las habilidades especiales de cada una de las compañías y es que no viene ni una sola ayuda y la verdad es que esta información la podían haber impreso o en el tablero o mediante iconos en las tarjetas de acciones de cada una de las compañías, algo explicable solo desde el punto de vista de reducción de costes porque Queen siempre ha sido cuidadosa con estas cosas.

El juego tiene un desarrollo bastante sencillo pero que es difícil de dominar, uno de los aspectos mas polémicos del juego podría ser la inclusión de un orden variable del juego, cada ronda los jugadores meten en una bolsa de tela tantas fichas como sea su posición una tabla de ingresos, es decir, si el amarillo va primero mete una ficha, si el verde va segundo mete dos y si el rojo va tercero mete 3. Se sacan 5 fichas y se colocan por orden en un track y ese es el orden del juego para esa ronda, habrá jugadores que jueguen mas rondas y puede ocurrir que si vas el primero te quedes sin poder realizar acciones durante esa ronda. Este sistema es polémico porque no es del agrado de muchos jugadores, ya que penaliza a un jugador, pero la verdad es que evita el posible efecto líder y acerca a los que van mas atrás haciendo que el juego sea bastante dinámico.

En cada ronda se hacen hasta 5 acciones que realizan los jugadores por turnos, en cada una de estas acciones un jugador puede pasar, subastar una acción o construir vías.

Subastar una acción requiere algo de experiencia y algo de calculo, volviendose una actividad mas critica según avanza el juego, porque andas sobrado de dinero pero no sabes si te queda tiempo de juego para recuperar tu inversión con el reparto de beneficios.

Durante la acción de construir vías puedes construir hasta 3 vías para unir ciudades que se paga del dinero que adquiere la compañía cuando se compran sus acciones. Siempre que se construye posteriormente se reparten dividendos de todas las compañías y la compañía que construye reparte el doble.

German Railways es un juego de experiencia, con curva de aprendizaje y algo de gestión milímetrica, los fallos se pueden pagar caros, con una sola partida es difícil dar una impresión de este juego que es mas profundo de lo que parece y con mucho dinamismo.

Habrá que jugar mas.

The "turn order mechanic" (i.e., randomly denying people turns mechanic) serves neither as a catch-up mechanic nor an interesting way to vary turn order. It's terrible. It's so terrible, and the rest of the game sufficiently bland, that this game has no reason to exist.

Some cool ideas with some rough edges.  I like the chit-pull turn-order mechanic in the second half of the game, but it can hurt players early.

Ugh.  JC likes this game and finds it intriguing, which pretty much means that I find it tedious and painfully drawn-out.  There are a lot of end-game calculations to do, and a question of "when will the game end?" that is critical to figuring out how much to bid on stocks.  As in many bidding games, the value of a stock depends on groupthink; if everybody bids low on a stock, it might not get enough money to fund its rail-laying actions.  And the difference of one dollar in a company's coffers can make all the difference!

Oh yeah, then there's the randomness of the turn draws -- you may be in first, but still get to do an action every turn, while other players don't get any actions.  Very unpredictable, annoying, and unfair.

Unlikely that I'll ever play this again.

Now I knew that I was a fan of the Winsome shared incentive structure, but this takes is to new heights with its variable turn order (shaped entirely by positioning and, interestingly, a bit of luck of the draw weighted by position). It strongly encourages players to either be WAY out in the lead, or keeping the play band very close in waiting for that perfect break-away/game-end moment. Not only that, but the special abilities are not game-breaking but a nice little added twist to the formula as well. Too bad the Queen games edition is a bit of a challenge in its usability (i.e., the shares don't have the special abilities on them, and the colours can be hard to distinguish!).

RATING: 7
Ohh, here's a tough one to rate. I unreservedly liked everything in the game except that kah-razy turn order system. And even that... I have to give it points for doing something wildly different. I found it kind of tolerable, but then I didn't miss out on more than a round at a time. In my first play, one player missed out on 4 rounds in a row. He didn't do well. If I were that guy I'd probably hate this game. There may be some real depth here, but I'm not sure that depth is a good fit for the whole "maybe you get a turn, maybe you don't" thing. In spite of all, I kind of want to play it again. Maybe it's one of those deals where frustration makes success sweeter... We'll see. For now, it gets a 7, and I could see this rising or falling quite a bit.

A couple comments on the Queen production... not bad, though there are some color issues. The orange and yellow stocks and trains are very similar, and player colors could have been more differentiated from the stock colors. Also, shame on Queen for not including player aids in a game that so obviously needs them. Those company special powers are critical, and they need to be easily accessed.

I have been very impressed with the train games from Winsome, as there is a clean simplicity of mechanics, spartan components, all meshed tightly to a train theme. However, due to very limited production runs and little advertising, these games are few and far between. Nevertheless, all of the Winsome games I've played so far (with the exception of the SNCF, IMHO) are very good train games. I believe Preusiche Ostbahn is one of those games, with an interesting fixed map, and a number of railroad companies with varying capabilities. Re-titled German Railways, this should prove to be another winner from Harry Wu (Chicago Express, Samarkand), as it gets more visibility from the mainstream gaming crowd.

Update (12/31/11) 2 plays: Played the re-titled German Railways finally. While production values are excellent with a larger, more colorful board, there were several misses: 1) The Winsome veterans all missed the cubes, which are now represented  by tiny wooden trains. These trains are hard to handle and make spotting the cities more difficult; 2) The specific capabilities (and number of trains) of each of the train companies is not printed on the board as in the Winsome version. (This is probably to ensure the board was language independent.) This means player aides are necessary, and should be included in the game, but they were not. We had to print out a number of them before our first game; 3) The stock certificates are printed on VERY thin, cheap paper, sort of like glossy tissue paper. They are easy to crease and warp with very little moisture. We had to immediately sleeve them. Why Queen would skimp on this vital component escapes me; 4) The player turn discs could have be left as cubes from the original version, as handling them was clumsy also.

Beyond the minor production quibbles, there seems to be one minor rule change with the red company: the first hex build is free, regardless of terrain. From what I understand of the Winsome version, the most expensive terrain was free. This did not affect play, but certainly made the red company expansion early and more profitable quickly.

German Railways is novel with its interesting turn-order mechanic of randomly drawing turn-order discs from a bag. The higher up a player is on the income track, the fewer discs of his is placed in the bag. The player with the worst income has progressively more discs placed in the bag. One would think statistically this "catch-up" mechanic would even out the game. A stroke of bad draws could leave a player with no actions, as was my case. One could conclude that this would make the game totally random, and break the game. However, I was able to get ahead in the game (and eventually win) by getting more dividends by buying into other companies with the few actions I received. Shrewd auctioning is required to incentivize other players to pay more than what is necessary to fund a company, or to get a company for your self at a discount. Thus, depending on the player, it is love/hate relationship with the turn-order mechanic, but overall makes for an exciting game.

All in all a good, solid train game that is a close cousin, almost an older brother of Henry Wu's other design, Samarkand, due to the dividends being paid out when two companies meet for the first time. Samarkand pays out only to the active and passive families, contrary to GR paying out to ALL companies. Samarkand pays according to a fixed schedule of 3 and 1 durants to the active and passive families, while GR will pay dividends according to a progressively increasing income schedule dependent on number of cities connected. The end conditions of both games is similar, where Samarkand ends when every family has made first-contact OR one family has made 5x first-contacts with other families. GR ends when every company has merged with two other companies (or it is determined that this is not possible). Samarkand is elegant in how it keeps track through the "handshake" tokens (we kept track with coins in GR). It is clear that Wu simplified and streamlined the payout mechanic for Samarkand, such that it is a much more suitable family-style game, while GR requires constant fiddling, calculating, and adjusting of the income schedules.

It is also a distant cousin to Chicago Express, due to its simplified stock market and auctioning. (I believe B&O is much closer in mechanics, theme, and feel, although it is meatier in weight.) However, when comparing the two, I'd much prefer GR to CE any day. I'm raising this to a '9', and dropping CE down a notch.

Update (01/28/12) 5 plays: 3-player game has a significantly different feel. It feels less chaotic, since everyone starts with more money, and there is a greater chance for action discs. Because of this, it is relatively easy to maintain a tight game. Unfortunately, this means it is less forgiving; some seemingly minor mistake by one person early on could be game-breaking and king-making in the long run. That makes the game nerve-wracking for the first several turns, since those little mistakes will be amplified and add up; it's brutal.

Update (07/20/12) 7 plays: The random draw of player actions was at one time humorous, but now, it seems there is not enough granularity. Even if in last place due to income, and entitled to four-five action discs, it is entirely possible to get screwed and not draw any discs for that player. The game is highly volatile and fragile, meaning one mistake from one player (or a mistake on the part of group-think) could easily break the game for another player. We're still not at the level of play where we are comfortable riding on the knife-edge of disaster. There is never a turn that we are ever sure what is the optimum play, because the game state changes quickly and dramatically. It has been amply demonstrated that not spending any money on the initial auction round, and with everybody else spending theirs will give that person the win. Like multi-player chicken, it is a fine and blind balancing act of keeping enough money to prevent another from going to town with the stock auctions. Because of it's fragility, I'm dropping this down to an '8'. It will be tough to bring this one back to the table, as it is no longer an amusing game, but an intense, cut-throat, unforgiving game of balancing incentives and coercion.

This game has some really interesting things going for it except for the turn selection mechanism.  Despite what statistically should happen, in the only game I've played so far with 5, the person in last place didn't get a turn for 3 rounds.  By the time she got a turn she made 3 dollars when dividends payout and everyone else was in the high teens.

Because the turn order selection is such a huge deal in how you do in the game, I have to rate this low.  If this could be fixed, I really think it could go up to an 8 or 9.

Interesting mechanic that the farther behind you are, the more likely you are able to have a turn (or multiple turns) during a round. If you are winning, you might not have a turn.

It's been a while but someone got her finger in pretty much every pie early on and was making a ton of money. She never had another turn for the rest of the game, and won. It was quite a strange experience, one that the four of us will probably not forget, and will do our best to avoid from happening in the future haha.

I'm glad I held onto German Railways for the 2 year (!) gap between my first and second plays.  Whereas my first outing was an exercise in confusion, during my second go things definitely started falling into place (playing with three the second time probably helped. I would venture to say it is best to learn the game with three - the dynamics are not as subtle and it is much easier to understand what the important factors of the game are with only two opponents. It is also easier to recover from a blunder).  

Though it has superficial similarities to Chicago Express, German Railways is a very very different beast. Whereas in Chicago Express the fundamental interplayer dynamics can be grasped fairly quickly (setting aside actually forming a winning strategy) and remain more or less static from play to play, German Railways introduces several wrinkles that keep things unpredictable.  Most obviously, the variable turn mechanism means you must try to manipulate the game state to benefit you even if you don't get turns (probably the most difficult to reduce to practice).  The other, and much more under-appreciated, X factor in German Railways is the special dividend paid by a connecting railroad.  Not only do you have to try to factor this into your bidding, but the timing of triggering a connection is perhaps one of the most important factors in the game (in fact, I think it's safe to say that the game is won or lost in these dividends). Additionally, the lack of share dilution and mad rush of late dividends leads to boatloads of cash, meaning that mid- and late game auctions are more difficult to evaluate than Chicago Express's razor-thin auction margins.  The interplay of turn order, dividend triggering, auctions, and changing share distribution lead to such a constant state of flux that half the fun is just trying to keep up with the game, which is a feeling I don't really get from Chicago Express.  

To borrow the oft-used cliche, if Chicago Express is a knife fight in a phone booth, then German Railways is a club fight in a mudslide. The weapons are bigger and more powerful, but the ground is constantly shifting under your feet; sometimes you're forced to take a big swing in the hopes you'll hit your opponent, but it's just as likely you'll end up face down in the mud.

(If it sounds like I'm down on CE, I'm not.  It's in my all-time top 5.  I just use it as an obvious point of comparison, and right now I'm more interested in exploring GR's subtleties)

UPDATE #2: This game just keeps getting better every time I play.  Love it.

RATING: 7
I just don't know.

I really like the underlying structure of German Railways. It's got the same parts of Chicago Express that I enjoy, but it cranks all of them up another notch. There's now eight companies instead of five, and all of them have unique abilities. Stock is also still a major feature, but it only comes out in set tranches, keeping some companies from selling out immediately. The building is also cranked up a bit, since you want to connect to other companies in order to make payouts. At the same time, you don't want to connect before your company is worth the big bucks, since there is a double payout for whichever company actually builds the connection.

In principle I should love it, and I do apart from one thing. The turn order mechanism. I understand it's a selling point of the game. I also understand that a lot of the tension in the game and strategic decisions is based around where you position yourself in order to get turn order advantages. I still don't like it, though. I think it's a case of the chance being too obviously presented. I prefer chance as an injector of unpredictability, and it seems like GR too often relies on the pull of the turns to determine major advantages.

I'm sure there is ways to hedge your bets and affect how devastating bad pulls can be, but I'm not sure if I care enough to try and discover them. My gaming group likes it a lot, so I'm sure I'll end up playing it more. Hopefully it turns out to be poor play on my part.

Very interesting.  I think the German Family game thing is a joke because this is a very opaque game with multiple things to consider.  I can see why people would hate the turn order mechanism but I like it.  It is really the heart of the game though and careful planning and bidding will generally win out in the end.  3 or 4 seem better than 5 which was much more chaotic and less fun to me.

With a "proper" turn order mechanism, I think this could be a "9" instead of the much more mediocre rating I have given it.

interesting, feels maybe a bit too random for this type of game.  or maybe im just playing it badly.

It looked good, but I am afraid this game does not work. There is a lot of randomness in the order mechanism, and the players who get the higher amount of money are able to buy most of the stocks. Then the auction has no style, limited to offering amazing amounts of money. Disappointment.

We gave a new opportunity to this and it made us a better impression. Anyway, it's more an abastract game than a train one, where the most important is having attend to the lines connections. All the players disliked again the turn system, that discs in the bag...

One play into it and I prefer this to Chicago Express. I don't really understand the comments of the Winsome experts that this game is an exercise in manipulating incentive structures of other player etc. But I feel more in control and can better estimate what the value of a company is or what the effect of my actions will be. The special abilities of each railroad are a nice feat adding flavor to the game. There is less potential for beginners to severly influence the game in a negative way for another player which is a good thing in my book.
The biggest drawback might be the random cube draw for turn order. Extreme distributions in the early game can decide the game against (or potentially for) single players. In the first game it happened to one player who didn't get a single action in the first two turns even though he had the lowest income. He wasn't able to compensate this. At the same time, the single cube of the highest income player was drawn first three times in a row. If such happens regularly, the rating might go down. Another small drawback is the play time of 2-3 hours. The last moves can drag as not every player will have meaningful actions left.

The least satisfying cube rail game I've played so far. I can kind see how the point of the game is largely about getting into a position where you're drafting off of other people's actions. But the random element is just so massive and most of the game such repetitive nickel and dime action that the point really was drowned.

I'm willing to give the game another play, because I realize that part of the problem is due to inexperience, but German Railways (we played the Queen version, not the earlier Winsome version) was way too long! It was fun in the beginning, but dragged on way longer than it should have been. Anything more than one hour is just overkill.

After playing this, we went back and tried Samarkand (the Queen games version of Age of Scheme, not the Sackson Abacus game) and found it to deliver nearly the same experience in a fraction of the time.

*All Comments Based on Solo Play*

Pretty quick game in which each decision is tough an can potentially put you in an inesscapable position. It might be more chaotic and fragile than I'd like, though it does have the appeal of seeming parsable. That is, with the right calculations I think players can start to narrow in on tight sensible play decisions.

I like that each company has a special power which sort of makes them seem a little historical even if it is mostly lip service. The power, start location, number of trains, and order in starting auction does certainly give each company a unique gameplay flavor. The financial aspects don't seem terribly simulative of anything but they are interesting as gameplay mechanics and aren't actively in opposition to reality. I do like the way they apparently drive the players to build routes that seem somewhat reasonable and historical.

I do not like the Queen Games graphic design, or oversized box. The wooden components and cloth bag are nice though.

German Railways is a fun and fast playing railroad route building game in the Chicago Express vein.

I really like the method for determining who plays each round.  A number of tokens for each player are put into a bag with the number of tokens being based on current player ranking.  Then a number of tokens equal to the number of players are randomly drawn from the bag.  This determines who plays during the current round and in what order.

I also like the different powers for each of the different railroads whether it's to build an extra track, pay one less for each track, etc.

The design of the company shares is really poor because it's really difficult to distinguish yellow from orange and black from brown.  This is a big fail by the publisher.

Overall, this is an enjoyable game and will be added to my collection someday.

After several plays, this game's curious turn-order mechanism has grown on me.  Its rating has risen to 7.

A deduction absolutely must be made for the [i]German Railway's[/i] graphic design.  Yellow, orange, brown and black are all so muddied as to be nigh-indestinguishable at a glance.  And since each company has a special power, iconic references to those powers really should have been printed on the board edge in each company's  slot.  Alas.

Update: I created new graphics for the shares and gave away the ones that came with the game.  Speed of play is much improved. :)

This game sat on the shelf of our FLGS for several years and I never pulled the trigger on it until recently when they put it on sale.

It has a random turn order selection which adds angst to the game. Overall, it is easy to teach and is quite fun as a medium weight train game.

In the end i had a whopping 91 income but couldn't cash in on it.

I really like the turn order mechanism in this game as something different - there is a fairly high element of chance in this that could frustrate those who prefer little to no luck.  The different powers of the 8 railroads also add in a bit of flavor to the game.  Ideally, you want to put yourself in a position to connect railroads in which you have majority of stock with another railroad which leads to a double dividend payout for that railroad while every other RR pays out the regular dividend.  As well, the focus of this game is really about developing mutual interest with 1-2 other players in a few companies and letting them do the work for you while you focus on a different company.  You can go far even without many turns.  Messing with the turn order mechanism would make this game far less appealing and dynamic in my book.

The turn order mechanism  and special condition for each railroad for this game are what set it apart from other games of its type.

Although a great concept in realaity thisgames comes down to a lot of luck.
If you are in the lead and constantly get your action drawn it skews the game anf if you are behind and do not get the extra actions you get hosed and it changes the outcome of the game. Was it playtested properly. I am certain that it was not, however that is how bussiness is done these days. 
Just the fact that all 8 railroads have a special ability and no mention of this on the spacious board is just one of the little things that proves this point.

I think this is a better implementation than Chicago Express. The economics don't appear to be completely balanced, but it works out. The game itself has a quick pace with a short mid-game.

This is an interesting train game with a good number of railroads; however the most interesting element is the turn order.  At the end of the turn, you get a number turn order tokens drawn from a bag.  You may get to go earlier because there are more tokens in the bag for you if you are doing well, but that is not guaranteed.    

Each train company has a special ability.  

I liked the game, but if you do not like the turn order mechanism, you will not like the game.  I thought it added an element of chance where you could mitigate this over the course of the game.

RATING: 3
How did the turn order mechanism make it past playtesting? The rest of the game could be quite interesting, but the way it is it just doesn't work.

The players that get turns early won't auction a share as long as they can build their own railways. If they manage to connect to someone else (and they should if they bid enough for their first shares) they will make a lot more money than those that didn't get any turns (through the bonus for connecting). They will then be able to buy more shares and on the long run there is no way to catch up with that. It's a pure win-to-win with an element of luck that is very decisive.

I would play this again if the turn drawing bag had a memory (i.e. you just add new cubes every turn and don't remove those from previous turns).

First impression after on 3p game.  I really enjoy this Winsome/Harry Wu gem.  Though it's too early to make a final judgment, in some ways I enjoyed it even more than Chicago Express.  The turn order mechanism is brilliant, and adds just the right amount of uncertainty which can be partly managed by strategic placement.  The central location to which all go I prefer it to the race to one edge of the board.  The timing of the dividends (and the fact that one can skip some dividends) is relentless and very dynamic.  Only downside is the extra overhead of having to learn about the different companies exceptions, but that is part of learning a skill based game.  I can't wait to play it again and would suggest it over Chicago Express if I had to make a choice.  Other pluses -- virtually zero donwtime, exciting auctions, highly interactive.  A real gem for this kind of game.

German Railways - there are a bunch of really neat things happening here..  First of all there are eight train company's.  Up for grab are three shares per company.  One share is auctioned from each at the start.  On your turn you can only do three things: 1) auction a share (the third share of a company cannot be auctioned until two of all the others are sold).
2) place track to increase the railways value (i.e. by connecting cities).  This action may also trigger a dividend round if railways connect.
3) pass

Each company has a unique rule when it comes to dividend payouts and placement of track.  Some build faster, some pay less for different terrain, some don't pay dividends until they reach Berlin, etc. 

Like many money games having the correct shares in companies which are likely to merge is a key.  And having more shares than your opponents helps as well.  I felt my opponents overspent their cash in the opening sell.  I had a bunch of money so everytime my turn came around i bought a new share for relatively cheap.  This in essence helped me lead most of the game and I won with a large margin.

There is only one other caveat.  Your current position in the game determines how many tokens you put into the bag for turn order.  

Example: Let's say I own one share of the blue, red, and black lines.  If the value of these companies is 18 that is my current position.  If opponent a has a value of 10, opponent b has a value of 15 and opponent c has a value of 19 here is what would happen: opponent c puts one token in the bag, I put two, opponent b three, and opponent a four.  Four tokens are then pulled one at a time.  This determines the turn order for the next round.

With my early jump I likely played only half of the game and I still won.  Only one token was going into the bag each turn.  I deliberately created some ties with my opponents to mitigate the effects of the system (i.e. they put less tokens into the bag).

I am not sure if this runaway leader problem would happen often.  It did in our first game but that definitely wouldn't stop me from playing it again.  Simple and fun!! 

The only thing I want to gripe about is the colour choices made.  Player colours were the same as railway company colours.  And the yellow and orange were hard to tell apart as were the brown/black.

I am sure next game the money will remain much tighter and I have a hunch with that happening my rating will improve.

Ostbahn is a great game but it has one major problem, similar problem as Pampas Railroads has: There are just so many great train/stockholding/tight economy games out there (from 18xx, Age of Steam, Wabash, Steel Driver....etc) and while at first Ostbahn feels as one of the most original and fresh....eventually all the "new" is just refining from the "been there and seen that and played even more".

But again Ostbahn would be easy '9' if no above mentioned titles. '8' is no shame and if the endgame had been a little sharper (read "better"..rules variant?) then '9' could have been just a right rating for it.

Edit: upped to '9' bit later. Classic.

Wabash's big, more forgiving, brother is a hoot to play.  It's a game of somewhat indirect collusion and timing.  

There are 8 companies which each contain 3 stock certificates & a well-balanced company "power".  The companies compete on a large playing board that contains city and rural hexes containing one of 3 differently priced terrain types.  Only one track can be built into a rural area, allowing for some defensive gameplay but multiple companies can build into a city.

When two companies meet for the first time everybody receives a payout (player's current income).  Everybody owning stock in the company that made the connection receives additional income equal to that companies current value.  A company's value increases when it connects to cities.  When you buy stock it's value is not diluted.

The game also has a very cool turn-order mechanism which you can read about in the forums.  It's one of the most important parts of the game and although it can be frustrating at times your goal is to figure out how to make it less frustrating.

Enjoyed some aspects of this but I don't have a good feel for stock evaluation, finding that balance of sufficient treasury to get to the first dividend and keeping personal money around for the next auction. This makes me very bad at the game and makes it difficult to enjoy. Maybe some practice will change that, but I'm not sure if it will happen.

Much like chicago express, initially a phase where you're buying shares based on whether you think the railway has good growth potential based on who else owns it transitioning into a phase where you're valuing shares based on theories of when the game will end, and then trying to push for the end you want with the quirk that you may have no control since you have the highest income. Since there is no dilution and the number of shares are few, it feels there are fewer means for controlling incentives. There is more play on the board though, where it's easy to cut off a railroad to prevent a payout. While the turn order mechanism is very interesting and really makes the game, it's not something most people enjoy.

After one play, I liked German Railways a lot but it's probably a bit of a niche offering. It combines a fairly dry economic setting with tough player incentive structures and a large dash of chaos. Not everyone wants to ride that wave.

Wonderful game. I like this one a lot. With all the money flowing around, this is more of a "feelgood" game than Wabash Cannonball.

A nice change of pace, really. There are plenty of opportunities for interesting tactical manoeuvres, though. Also, don't give up if you're losing - it's possible to come back from very dismal positions.

The turn order mechanism is simply brilliant, and I like how the different railroads have different capabilities.

The more I play the game, the more I enjoy it. This is one of my favourite games.

Enthusiastic.

I fall into the camp of people who find the player-action-selection-bag mechanic swingy and not fun. I'd much rather play Wabash. Or play this with pseudo-Wabash rules. Or, in the three player game, let the bag determine order of six actions, rather than having 6-choose-3.

I like the way the game is built so that one is forced to ally with others in order to win: the game is played in a very different way than other train games. What I like a bit less is that in order to allow this, there is a random element that in the first turns can be decisive. So the luck factor is a bit beyond my threshold, but in return, the game is really fun to play.

There are many 18XX stock market train games, and also quite a lot "little brothers", like [thing=41749][/thing], Harry Wu's original [thing=31730][/thing], or this [thing=35285][/thing], also by Harry Wu. They basically try to streamline the experience from the 18XX games into something simpler and shorter.

It transports Chicago Express to a Germany map, with a very, very simple ruleset that include a few changes that create profound effects. On the paper, these changes seem very interesting (especially the turn order setup, which is supposed to work as an equalizer/catchup mechanic), but in our game, they created lots of chaos:
-> The turn order can be very punishing for some unlucky players and it will easily decide games. It doesn't work that well as a catch up mechanism. This is my main issue.
-> The double dividend pay can be easily abused right from the start to benefit from a large advantage that can later be snowballed to a degree.
-> Differences are likely to be snowballed. Chances are you will have runaway leaders or/and players left behind.
-> The secondary endgame condition is a bit fiddly (game ends when everybody agrees that not all companies can make 2 connections; wtf? This is maths, why the need to agree? And don't we make at least the connections with the companies that still can do them?).
-> The duration was nowhere near the advertised 60 minutes.

Overall, it's not a bad game, but it's too chaotic for me. I put this after Chicago Express, a game I sold because i enjoyed American Rails more...

Involving and interactive stuff, and my favourite aspect with a full complement of five is the almost Diplomacy element to the decisions. But accurate valuation is very difficult, making the auctions somewhat redundant, and it's quite easy to be worked into a no-win situation where your last few turns may be just marking time. The catch-up mechanic has the potential to be deeply annoying as well.

Well, I like this game.  But I have issues with the Queen production. Like Paris Connection, the trains are pretty small.  The biggest issue I have is with the share certificates - some of the colors (brown/black, yellow/orange) look too similar.  In terms of game play, there is some strategy considering the randomness of who actually gets a turn each round.  And in some ways, it kind of feels like a snowball game, which is a genre I'm starting to enjoy.

One 3-player game with 2 rules wrong...at least from reading the reviews.  The instructions look good, but we had trouble getting everything clear.  

The player in first drew a turn out of the bag more than they missed it.  We all missed a few turns, but our 3rd place finishing player felt very frustrated that she missed crucial turns in the middle, usually in 1st but even in 2nd place once, while others drove their advantageous lines into mergers and double-payouts instead of her being able to use the position she had gained to get the mergers.  I missed turns in an already advantageous position and won a couple of crucial auctions during that time.  

It looks like we missed only one Around Berlin Zone hex per railroad, and that you couldn't auction 3rd shares until all of the 2nd's were gone.  That would have changed things drastically.  I drove a couple of 2-1 advantages hard for the win.  

Interesting game that may be hard to find a willing group for.

RATING: 8.5
Similar to Chicago Express, but the companies all have special powers and are scattered around the map. There are a lot more dividends and special dividends, so scores go much higher. It's more about building a posture that does not depend on *you* getting actions. Like Chicago Express, you want to build partnerships (share ownership structures) such that you can benefit from other players actions, and ideally make actions that help you and no-one else. Better with more players but 3 is still pretty good.

What I like:
- Plays fairly quickly (5p learning game 100 minutes)
- Nice components (aside from color issues described below)

What I don't like:
- I don't like shared-ownership/stock-holding games
- Not getting a turn for a couple rounds is frustrating
- Strategies are very opaque in the first play
- Having to memorize the special abilities of each line was annoying
- Several colors were too close to each other

The turn order mechanic is a catch-up mechanism, but it's very swingy, and can lead to extensive downtime at times. 

As seems to be the case with many stock games, is is very hard to see the effects of your moves, and of course you are at the mercy of other shareholders. Unlike some stock games, owning more stock does not give you any additional control over the company.

The rules are actually fairly simple, so I would put the rules weight around 2.2. There is quite a bit of depth, so I would put the weight around 2.6, still much lower than the BGG-voted weight.

RATING: 6.5
Hard to decide about this one - initially I thought the weighted draft mechanic of the turn order was a really neat idea. Having been (a little) and seen (a lot) people on the end of it I'm not so sure - A game where you go and make a round of coffees for all the players and not miss much? not so sure that's going to be a regular table topper.

The share ownerships and mechanics of the game are nice and each railroad having it's own ability looks to be an interesting twist, I'm just not convinced it's enough of one to overcome the long gaps. Also, is piggybacking to victory really that satisfying?

Not happy about the turn order mechanism. Everything else feels fairly calculated, but then you're just pulling cubes from a bag to see if you get actions?   

This game is quite a bit about creating little incentives for other people to join with you. At least temporarily. 

1/14- Update- I think turn order mechanism just kills this game for me. Play tonight, I didn't have one action til end of 3rd round. I felt like game was pretty much over for me at that point.

Update- sold it. This just didn't do much for me overall.

Fascinating dynamically shifting relationships among players.  The player with the highest income has the least chance of getting turns, and this can set up a lovely bounce-back dynamic.  

The values of shares at auction starts in the low teens, and players have little starting cash.  As dividends start to come in, shares prices rapidly escalate in value.  They seem to peak in the $40 range, but I'm not sure I've seen the top yet [edit: I saw a share sell for $116. The guy lost the game. Maybe peak values are in the $60-$70 range].  Naturally values collapse close to the endgame.

Overall this is one of my top three Winsome games. For reference, the other two are Wabash Cannonball and the Early Railroads series (which is basically one game with three maps).

I'm unsure of how to feel about this game. I think there is a lot of clever and interesting play in this game, but I don't know how long that will take to unlock. Our first game of this had a MAJOR run-away leader problem. That player snowballed and we couldn't stop it. It was potentially our fault based the auctioning, so I can't fault the game for it, but I don't know what else to do if someone gets some money and buys out the shares. We also had a fluke where the first player ALWAYS got their marker out on the action track. Not that it matters in the long run, but it gave them ample opportunity to auction off shares.

Very deep game. Best with 5 players. The luck of the draw in turn order can be too decisive with 3 players. A lot of math involved. Games are usually close with several lead changes. We have a lot of trouble distinguishing the different colors of shares.

Exciting train game where the auctions have more emphasis than track building. It is quite different from Chicago Express and to me it actually reminded Modern Art because it has similar feel of how you speculate on auctioned shares and worry more about predicting the market behaviour than actually controlling it. This is why the turn order mechanism works well.

RATING: N/A
For goodness sake, this one is three actions, one of which is "Pass." A really nice cube rails game where the auction-centric problem is not simply "collectively discover the true price of the share." It's not straight ROI, and what I love about it is how sometimes you can overspend on a share and it's the right move. 

I have three knocks on it. One is that the income track needs constant tending to since the incomes change so frequently and errors are easy to make, and the second is that new players need to know it's primarily an auction game and not a railroad building game. If you go into this thinking it's a track-building game, you're going to think that you're being screwed when you don't get a token drawn from the bag. The game is asking you if you can win a wealth-building game without getting a turn where you can build your own wealth. Believe it when you hear about people winning this game not getting a turn after Round One. 

The third knock on it is that the Queen share certificates are useless and indistinguishable. I "pimped" my copy by replacing my shares with 3x5 index cards that have the word "Purple" written on it in purple marker, and then I scribbled the company's special power in the corner. It works better than the game-issued shares, and I'm not even kidding.

This game has a much different feel than Wabash Cannonball and takes longer to play.

The big talking point seems to be the turn order mechanism.  I personally think it works great.  When I first read the rules I thought that the smart player will be able to improve his position without taking turns.  That definitely seems to be the case so far.

The round of bidding that opens a session of this game is absolutely vicious.  Bid too high and other players will be able to snatch up stocks for cheap.  Bid too low and the railroads you've invested in won't have the flexibility to initiate dividend payouts.

The upside:
-Maybe it's silly, but special powers applied to train games are awesome. It's like investing in a way of running a company and not just the company potential.
-It's "open". Companies start everywhere, and how they should evolve doesn't seem to have a perfect way. They depend on each other for that.
-There's a lot to manipulate here, either the game or the ones who play it. Hell, they say you can win it without taking a turn. I'm into that, the manipulating part, but sadly I don't get nearly enough play time to exhibit that.

Key differences from Chicago Express: 8 railways to operate; each railway has unique features or strengths/weaknesses based on historical fact (e.g. one can build 4 tracks vs. 3, one only can build 2 tracks, one needn't pay extra for arriving after others into a city, etc.); each railway only has 3 shares; and the turn order is quite unique -- giving players with low income the highest chance of taking a turn (or turns, as players are not guaranteed a turn), i.e. their odds increase inversely with their income.

Can you set yourself up to win with the most money yet not take many actions throughout the game?

Preußische Ostbahn / German Railways is a very fun, cube rails game with no share dilution but a very novel turn order mechanism: draw players' cubes from a cup equal to number of players; the lower your income, the more chances you have of getting to take actions that round. Dividends only pay out when 2 railroads meet for the first time (a la [thing=38637][/thing]).

This is a great, heavy version of Wabash.  There are enough significantly different elements about the game to justify owning both versions.  I feel that this game is quite a bit deeper, whether this is just an illusion or not, I'm not sure, but I buy into it.  

The turn order mechanic will drive people batty.  It is very likely that one player will lose the game based solely on not getting their cubes drawn.   Of course, good planning will require you to not have to actually take any turns at the end.

My big concern with the game is that it is really difficult to catch up at the end.  I'll have to play it some more to see if this is the case.

Were this not a Winsome game I would buy this in a heartbeat.  Now I have to wait around to see if a used copy shows up.

The turn order mechanic seems vastly inappropriate. Are we in a light, fluffy luck-based game? The potential for not getting to take a turn for several rounds sucks. The differing rail powers add complexity but seriously, I don't care about the history of railroading in 19th-century Germany all that much. I assume that the recommended age (8+?!) is some kind of joke.

I like Wabash Cannonball a lot better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is similar in some ways to Wabash etc: capitalize companies (buy shares), build track, most money at game end wins. A share in each of several companies are auctioned off to start the game. Each share, though, pays the current income in dividends (i.e., unlike other games income is not divided by outstanding shares to calculate dividend). Dividends occur when companies connect to other companies; the game ends when every company is connected to at least 2 other companies. Another difference from other train games: turn order mechanism is somewhat random. At the start of each round, rank player by income and place that many cubes in a cup. Draw n (= # players in game) cubes; those players take turns in the order drawn. So it's possible for a player to go a round (or, in fact, several rounds if they're particularly unlucky) without getting an action.

It's an interesting game but it is marred by the turn order mechanic. If you don't get turns early in the game, others will be able to take several actions, make connections, earn dividends, and build up a cash hoard that will be difficult/impossible to compete with. Being able to trigger dividends early in the game is vital (triggering company pays double dividends), and you just don't have that opportunity if your cube isn't pulled. I don't think I'd play this game much without some [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/339103]variant turn order mechanism[/url].

Super dynamic, and so utterly different from Chicago Express despite its ostensible mechanical similarities.

It's probably too opaque at the outset. The asymmetric company abilities/penalties make share valuation a meta-game challenge that is bordering on insurmountable for inexperienced players. Accidental kingmaking in this game is even easier than it is in most Winsomes because of the high-wire act of uncertainty.

The turn order mechanism is quite fascinating. I think it's ingenious, though it's easy to see why people wouldn't like it.

Unfortunately, Queen's design of the game is a criminal act of bad UX implementation. Company shares are too hard to distinguish at a glance because of the color scheme, and there is no player aid on the board to identify company abilities an penalties. You really need to create your own components to fix these issues, which I guess isn't too hard. But still, really?

For the most part, I think I liked this game.  I don't quite know if I liked the random Turn Draw though.

My rating keeps flip-flopping, ranging from a 4 to a 9.  I've settled on a 7 now.

The turn order mechanic seems clever at first, but can wear out its welcome.  Some games are decided by the cube draws.

One game with everyone being beaten around by the turn-order selection mechanism which wasn't that much fun. It's not without interest and I want to see what a game with more aggressive blocking would look like. Have to try it 3p.

Probably my favorite Winsome game so far.  Neither as frustratingly opaque (Riding series) nor as easily broken by poor play (Wabash, T&P et al) as some of the others that I've tried.  Ostbahn offers tense, challenging decisions and some surprising (for a Winsome) elements such as the novel turn order mechanism.  Based on my still limited experience, I think I like this best with 4.

This game has very simple rules, but more complex than Chicago Express. Timing of things is very important and the innovative way to determine player order does not allow this and it has you always at the edge of your seat. It is a risk management game with an evil ending condition that will disappoint many players, but the true fans of rail/stock games will enjoy this hidden gem!

Trying to move up to this from Samarkand and Paris Connection. This one has auctions with unconstrained bidding, which is the main thing making me uncertain that I'll like it.

The most noteworthy thing seems to be the rubberbanding mechanism, whereby players holding the most valuable stocks (according to their actual payouts) are less likely to get turns, meaning they're less likely to be choosing where rails expand or which stocks are auctioned off. An important asterisk is that having valuable stocks isn't how you win the game: it's based on most cash in hand.

...A consequence of the rubberbanding is that there's an extra "initiative" cost to buying a share beyond the money: You may be losing opportunity to get turns.

I think this game is a bit too opaque for me. I might be able to think through consequences of moves in order to pick out a good one, but I think there are too many numbers/factors for me to do it in real time. I might be wrong.

The auctions are a big problem for me. Very unconstrained (you end up getting hundreds of the currency). The "initiative" component of the cost, translated into cash held (i.e. VP), is hard to evaluate, but you seemingly should try. Also, it bugs me that the actual monetary value of a stock can feel calculable (especially towards the end of the game) such that it's probably going to pay out, say, either once, or twice. That's a significant difference and I don't enjoy feeling that I should try thinking it through.

I like the different abilities for each company.  Gameplay is very straightforward, and enjoyable.  However I need to be convinced about the selection of turn order, the leader can end up with no turns for a lot of the game, and that is a problem.

A Winsome shared incentive lab, but this time with more focus on asymmetry in train special movement rules, a hilarious & playful turn order set up that adds an unpredictable tactical twist to every turn, and a pleasurable focus on map positioning and route making shenanigans without the irritation of placing puzzle-like tile tracks. Shares aren't diluted and, despite the higher rules overhead, it's less opaque than Chicago Express or Container. 

So much depends on enjoying the turn order mechanic, randomized by pulling chits from a bag similar and with the high possibility you'll have rounds without a turn and some with multiple turns, all based on a probability structure favoring the player with the less money. But even without a turn to manipulate a train, you can participate in the auctions.

So, for example, I had three rounds in a row without a turn in my first game, but my share distribution kept me in the pack and when I got two turns in a row I was able to end the game with a double ding-dong, a quadruple payout, while my shares protected me from recourse in the final move of the game. So you can hit some outlier notes with the cube draw from the bag, reviving a dead player and burdening a strong one with fortune, but in the long it makes the game subversive, tactically twisted, and rather fun.

In short, holy crap, the Winsome lightbulb went on. The learning is exquisite, and the learning is NOT of rulesets and resource or VP conversion chains, but huge, wonderful [i]why[/i] questions.

-

*A ding dong is when you join two RR lines for the first time, initiating a table wide payout but a double payout for the player who made the play.

I liked game very much. This is more feelgood game compared to Wabash. Different companies gives excellent touche. This makes game feel more thematic, which is always good thing. I hope this will be re-published as Wabash.

RATING: 6
A little bit too random for my taste due to the turn taking mechanism. Some novel mechanics setting it apart from the rest of its competition. The variable company powers felt like an unnecessary complication and were a bit too strictly related to the companies starting positions making the companies in the end very similar. Also the game was a crawl until the first dividend payouts after which money was no longer an issue. In the end I prefer American Rails or Chicago Express over this even though this has some original addition to the genre.

Very intrigued, even if the actual few sessions I've played so far (among fellow novices) haven't really lived up to what I feel is the game's great potential. This is of course common in Winsome games, which take repeat plays by thoughtful players to really unveil themselves. The semi-random turn order mechanism of course seems problematic at first blush. While I'm not bothered by it, unfortunately it is yet another barrier to getting other people interested in exploring the game. I do hope that I can find the right group for this, as I see the potential for it to become a personal favorite.

Yes, the chaos of the random draws for player order can really screw you over. But:
1. You put yourself in that risky position.
2. It's so much fun!

It's a game with simple rules but a much deeper gameplay than what appears at first blush.

Straight network building railroad stock game. Eight companies with unique powers always start in same place. Turn order by NBA style lottery is unique and players can miss out on actions by luck of the draw. The strategy trick is to connect to another rail for a preferred dividend that pays double while not making it easy for someone else to connect to yours. Samey.

Still like this one a lot though I'm not in groups where it can be played as much as I would like. I'm not as good at it as I would like to be. I hope there is an app for it soon.

It's hard to get past the randomness of the turn order bag draw. I know many on line state this isn't a problem for them and its all about making the most of the opportunities you get. I need to play more to see what I really think but it's hard to get this to the table when American Rails is an option. The component design leaves a lot to be desired - I have created my own replacement share certificates that include a description of the special powers their company has.

I've played this as  a Winsome game twice now. This is the first time I've gone to log a play and discover that I had played it before and had no recollection of it. 

I may consider picking up the new version, but likely not. I don't think it would have enough re-playability to warrant the purchase.

After 1 Play: At times similar to Chicago Express, but more enjoyable. I liked the varying order and frequency of turns afforded by semi-random draw, but I dislike the chance for players to be shorted on total number of turns throughout the game.

Note: This refers to the original version - Preußische Ostbahn

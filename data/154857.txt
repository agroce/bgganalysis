Nice space exploration game.  More of a multiplayer solitaire.  There are options to attack other players but they are almost secondary to the game and the attack cards can be used to repair damage instead.  Can take over 4 hours to play at 3 or 4 player counts.  The way the time track works (based on movement points spent) means that the game can come to an abrupt end making it feel slightly anticlimactic.

A very interesting 3.5X game (pvp combat bearing an extremely loose integration, sadly) - with a solid implementation of hand management. The way damage cards are integrated is very much like Colt Express, but with far deeper gameplay. I really like the time tracker and epoch-shifts (which keeps the action tight and really tactical), with the storylines a neat little integration. I do think the random reward tables could have been a little better integrated, but the variety in captain powers and tech advancements make it a solid game. It really is a solo experience, but feels very much like a treasure hunting game. Recommended houserules: Captain Cards are an Either/Or for effects (not both), and shunting other ships cause big (3x and 1x cards) damage.

I've had this game for quite a while and my group brings this out again and again.  I really like the interplay between working toward your own goals, and thwarting the other players.  Every game plays out differently, requiring you to adjust your tactics to make the best use of your hand and resources, so it's got a lot of replayability.  Plus, the artwork is just fun!

I liked it but lacks a little bit of interaction and also the randomness of the events when you flip a tile (expansion stuff) is too much. Either you fail and is crushed or you succeed and get and immense bonus.

A nice exploration game with interesting mechanics and very different captain roles. I loved it, but one of my friends thought it was too long and tedious.
The main problem is that there is no good summary or player aid, as there is a lot of rules with many phases to consider.
Our first game took about 4 hours with 4 players for only 2 out of 3 epochs. There were a lot of browsing through the rules and interpreting some of them. Some rules were also either missing or well hidden. (The TDD distance =max 2 is missing, but I had read that in the forum). This game really needs a FAQ. You also MUST PRINT NEW version of the RULES!
I can recommend the game, but it requires a lot of patience the first time and I hope it will feel better next time.
The two following games were also great, but they stressed that the games is much better with 2-3 players.

Opinió després de una lectura de regles:
Molt similar al Mage Knight amb temàtica espacial i sense deckbuiding, es guanya per PV. Inclou igualment una baralla de cartes que determina el que pots fer cada torn, fins i tot inclou el tema de ferides igual que el MK i els punts de moviments inclosos a les cartes. Té tecnologies, losetes d'artefactes al estil Eclipse i encontres aleatoris com a Firefly. La interacció ve donada per les putades que es poden fer amb cartes o amb losetes d'atack, aquí no hi ha combat PVP com al MK. Hi han uns objectius de final de partida, 3 son fixes i s'afegeixen 3 adicionals al atzar.

Em sembla interesant, tot i que em dona la sensació que pot ser massa tancat i poc temàtic, com li pasa al Mage Knight... Per exemple, les recompenses per superar un encontre sempre son les mateixes (x PV, robar un artefacte, etc...), només depén de la dificultad del mateix. Com a joc d'aventures crec que prefeixo el Firefly. Tot i això, m'agradaria provar-l'ho a veure que tal.

An exploration game with no time to breathe or appreciate accomplishments.  Cards-as-actions-and-moves was simply too restrictive with such a small hand size.  The attack other player options were lame and felt tacked-on.  Movement as the game timer just meant everything ended as you were trying to get places.  Very nice art and components, but this game was not for me.

Great game, clean rules.  The level of complexity possible is surprising, with a nice flow to the game that makes it fun to play.  The Rule book is very clean, explaining everything from set up to more advanced rules in an easy to follow step by step style.

Emergence Event is fun and offers a slightly different approach to the space exploration theme. The most obvious difference is that encounters are not resolved with a roll of dice, but instead with a selection of cards from your hand. These cards are also what you'll use to move you through the galaxy, so you'll have some important decisions to make when planning your moves, reminiscent of Mage Knight as pointed out in more than one review. 

Attack and captain power phases are a bit fiddly, there are some ambiguous rules, the components are imperfect for tracking tech tree progression and temporary upgrades, and rewards are a bit overly complex. It doesn't always feel like there are ways to take control of your strategy -- for instance, if you're trying to collect artifacts, but don't have enough science to take control of a planet to get an artifact shard, there's not much you can do to pursue that strategy. The captain abilities can feel a bit imbalanced, but it will take a few more plays to verify.

Intriguing. There was a lot to take in for the first game, and it may be the kind of game where I just don´t have the stamina to follow what other players are doing. We'll see. The randomness is okay, I think, and the take-that aspect didn´t seem overwhelming. I like the various captains that give you some guidance as for what you should be doing.

This is a space exploration game designed by the creators of Myth. The rules are very clean and simple and it takes the awesome moment to moment gameplay from myth and gives it a more Euro VP focus. Explore the Galaxy, finish story arcs, and compete to be gain the highest mastery over technology or politics. This game has a lot going for it. I've only played solo so I can't speak on how quickly it plays with 4 players but I have high hopes for this one. It takes the great moments of Xia Legends of a Drift System, removes most of the randomness, and shaves off at least an hour of game time.

Gameplay: vp/technology tracks, deck building, exploration

Update: Still waiting for replacements for the broken ships. I won't be able to introduce this to my gaming group till they arrive. :(

02-09-2015. Rated after 1 play. Emergence Event (EE) is an interesting game in which you are a space captain flying through space, trying to discover stuff, control space ships, astroids and planets. The 'base' mechanisms are clever cardplay and smart upgrading of a tech tree. Each captain has a deck with cards that each give special abilities and bonusses for control/discoveries.

You discover and control stuff by adding the captain's (upgradable) stats with the (same) statistics on your cards.

First step each round is to attack and play captain cards. Captain cards screw all other players and help yourself, and are quite take-that-ish. The attacks are similarly so. I am not sure if I am a big fan of the way the game does this, but in my first play it was not too big of a problem.

After attacks/captain cards, each player moves in turn order over the map. You play cards to gain movement (stripes on the card). You then resolve an enocunter with a planet, astroid, space ship, discovery (if on a hex with one of those), or perform an open space encounter which are more random and therefore less predicitable. After completing such a task, you gain VPs, bonusses, tiles etc.

After all is said and done, you can upgrade your tech and gain techs and bonusses.

The game has quite simple rules, although there are a lot of rule ambiguities. If you get 3 artifacts, do you get the artifact immediately? Can you equip it before fitting in your stash.. How does it work if you get multiple rewards and your inventory is full.. can you grab resources before deciding what to remove etc. Maybe those are small rules we missed but they were not very claer immediately. Otherwise, I enjoyed it quite a bit. The captain cards I am not a big fan of.. the card art is gorgeous, the map is brilliant. The game is maybe a bit slow.

Regardless, the style of the game is fun. Nice stuff. I think the game could've used some streamlining and (even) better rules but otherwise it's still a good game, just a step from great.

:) Very unique captains, with unique decks, powers and special abilities
:) Great graphical design and art
:) Card based gameplay
:) Little downtime
:) Seems pretty balanced with all the unique captain stuff
:) Rulebook is colorful and mostly clear...

:soblue:  Though is flat out missing a few rules. Most are common sense though, only TDD movement being 2 is majorly missing.
:soblue: Turn options will be driven by your cards
:soblue: Lengthy, especially while learning
:soblue: Only 4 captains. I would have liked to seen more to mix up the 4 player games

A well balanced game with an interesting deck management like Mage Night less restrective.

A good exploration space game (with no real stragegy but how use his hand efficiency each round). If you don't like te be blocked by others players it's for you (by attacks or expension).

I love this game, I think its unfortunate there were mistakes made for the expansion kickstarter as well as unclear rules and a lot of over complications. But really, the bones of this game are fantastic and you'll always have a great time playing.

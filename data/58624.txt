Good implementation of the area impulse system. Quick playing but lots of choices to consider each impulse.

Based on one, interrupted, play, this is not grabbing me.  I can see how the mechanics lend themselves to a tense competitive game, but I'm not seeing how it has much to say about the actual battle.  May revisit.

Nope, sold it.  Prefer Legion's Dien Bien Phu

This is a wonderful, gut-wrenching, tense game.  I am involved in playtesting it, currently, and I really hope folks will vote for this beauty with their preorders.  Nick Richardson has a winner here...

[edit] Just played my first game with the published components (June 5, 2014) and it's not only lovely, but still a lot of fun.  So many tough decisions for both sides.  Highly recommended!

played a learning game. very brutal on the French.

Quickly read through the rules. Very light with almost no detail. Both good and bad. Will be easy to teach and play. Just won't be a "project", unfortunately.

Feb 2018 -- half a play in, and this is definitely very light (rules). Rare to reference the book. Just a few details to remember (Max def is 3, VM only assault into French-controlled). A good game for sure. But very abstract with little granularity. All depends what you're looking for.

Neat. Nice rule changes to reflect the nature of this battle.

RATING: 6
It seems to me that the French player has often, during the second part of the play, not many things to do, unless to wait for the Viet-Minh onslaught. 

During my play (I had the French army), I sometimes passed even beginning with the first impulse of the turn...

This is a fast playing, enjoyable, low complexity game. It obviously has similarities to Storm Over Stalingrad, the other game in the series, but Dien Bien Phu is more fun for me. This is because the Vietnamese are coming at the French from every angle, and there are strategy choices around whether to fight for the French supply sources or to go for the VP areas. The French can also hit back with some tough paratrooper units and air force cards.

just one game so far. Don't know why but had the feeling I was missing something. Maybe I was just a bit tired or I went in expecting to much...

Definitely am going to give this another shot and my rating might still improve

Solid game.  It was tense.  Played as the French 1st time out...really felt like the Viet Mihn were closing the noose.

RATING: 7
Fast-moving game on Dien Bien Phu that will appeal most to those who love area war-games with card play.  The system is very streamlined and easy to learn with a high excitement level.  There's a lot of abstraction here but the relevant lessons from the battle are easy to pick up.  Good competitive game that nevertheless is heavy on historical theme!

-This is the pretty much only playable DBP game at the time of writing. However it is a game, not a simulation of the battle.
-The attrition system doesn't reflect the slow attrition of French forces (it's either spent / retreat /eliminated). 
-The map uses the portrait format but I assume most people's table is set-up as landscape (to use a printing analogy).
-Better than expected gaming experience.
-The file "Flatten the Learning Curve Rules Summary" in BGG is very handy to have for your first games.
-The supply rules need a bit more chrome, or be less gamey. 
-The historical dilemma for the French player of choosing between reinforcements or supplies is not reflected by the rules.
-The assault rule may be too favorable to the VM player. In DBP, VM assaults were human waves running uphills against entrenched French positions...

Solid but like all games in the series attacking is much harder than defending. This one might be the best in the series though since it is a bit more dynamic. There are multiple approaches to attack and defend.

This is my favorite Area-Impulse type game. Both sides are constantly active, the defender is not just a passive counter pusher. The cards add a lot of tension and surprise. And the game is an excellent simulation of the battle. All this in a 3 hour game!

Moment to moment it doesn't really resemble Dien Bien Phu but looking at a higher level which considers the course of a full game it comes much closer.  Plenty of choices and tough decisions - especially when it comes to deciding how to pace a turn (simply sitting back and passing as the French is punished by the system, which is a good thing).  I should note the combat system is rather swingy (2d6 gives a big range of results) and sometimes you will get your teeth kicked in by the dice.

Probably the fastest playing game in the "Storm Over" series so far.  The French player needs to stay alert for the opportunity to conduct counterattacks and reinforce threatened areas.  I would have liked to have seen a better portrayal of the French airborne reinforcements as they just magically appear, but it works for the game.

Just played SoDBP right out of the box. Now, we have a bit of experience with Storm Over S-grad, but it took us 5 hours to complete with lots of yakking and beer.

Game was decided on the very LAST roll. A Viet Minh victory but the French had, at least, a one third chance of holding the final victory condition.

We thoroughly enjoyed SoDBP.

I can not recommend this game more highly.

Splendid game with much tension and heaps of decision making; it's lots fun to boot!  Will be playing this a lot over the coming weeks, me thinks.  Even better than Storm Over Stalingrad, but that's down to the subject, not the game mechanics.

A very simple game, but with plenty of depth and diversity and a great give-and-take gameplay.  One of those that feels painful on both sides for lack of options.  An excellent beginning title; easy access, LOTS to think about.

RATING: 7.5
All this is based on a first play - so take it with a shaker of salt, but....

Very enjoyable game, lots of history built into the cards, and when the 105 mm Howitzer cards go off you see why the French were defeated.  The presence of the cards provides lots of variation and replayability.  The game went to the last turn, with the French ekeing out a win.  We will definitely be playing again.  But....

If you like to come up with a perfect plan this is probably not the game system for you, as there is a great deal of luck when you combine the cards with the dice.  It is a 2d6 roll for most things, so you do have the bell curve to calculate with.  That wouldn't be enough for the planners I know, but you may enjoy it.  It should be tough for the French to win once the Viet Minh player learns his card deck and the system.  That causes me to dock it one point or so.

Still, a good game on a tough subject to game in an interesting fashion.

RATING: 6
Same mechanics as with Storm over Stalingrad but this game is very unbalanced.  One could easily adjust that but the way the designer put the balance in the game makes one wonder if they ever played it.

The Vietnam player will just wipe out the French.  

I didn't like this at all, but love the other Storm over games.

Not bad, but its weird to have a Dien Bien Phu game without any real Airdrop chrome. 

Conventional impulse (move or fire) but very good interaction with the tactical cards. En avant les Paras !

better than Storm over Stalingrad which I find pretty decent to start with.

Game is more open than Stalingrad. It's tougher and tougher for both sides, the Vietminh takes more and more losses the French have less and less to hold onto.

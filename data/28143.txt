GAME: Race for the Galaxy

RATING: 8
Interesting cardgame, reminds (a lot) San Juan, but much deeper. Brain-consuming! The icon system is not user-friendly, in my opinion.

RATING: 8
A role-selection model is used as a scaffolding to build your own - intergalactic - victory points engine, with plenty (an I mean PLENTY) of choices, all in a single deck of cards. The number of possible combinations and viable strategies is very high, with every card that adds a little twist to your progress through the game. You have to adapt your strategy to the cards you are dealt, with a new, different engine to tinker on during every play, an engine that keeps opening new paths at every turn. 
The first impact on an inexperienced player can easily be overwhelming. The rules are clear and well designed (albeit a bit lacking in elegance, also due to the complexity of what the game is trying to portray), but the variety of ways by which different cards can interact with the basic rules and all the different icons used to describe those interactions need at least a couple of games to familiarize with. Then, another couple of games could help in making your gameplay fluent, so that you can finally begin to look at what the other players are doing, instead of trying to fit the last couple of cards in your masterplan. Even if a bit confusing, this learning process is usually really fun, even when you still don’t really understand the strategic implications of your choices. 
A whole game can be really fast (usually under an hour even among inexperienced players), fast enough to easily lure for a second play after the first one and quite surprising in itself, considering the amount of gameplay and possibilities that are crammed in such a short amount of time.
The fact that each player has his own deck of roles/strategies brings interaction between players near to zero. Sure, you have to guess the roles that are going to be selected by your fellow players and select your role in a way that maximize your advantage and minimize theirs, but it’s just another variable that you have to consider when planning your next turn.

Card quality is really good. Illustrations go from good to really good and the sci-fi theme is strong and well implemented. If you find all the icons and text on the cards to be a bit unfathomable do not worry, it’s much WORSE than it looks. Really, look at the player aid. I assure you it'll become of real aid after a couple of plays, but at first it seems as straightforward as an encyclopaedia in a foreign language. The iconography, to be fair, is actually really functional once you get it, but of course you have to get it first. The rulebook is well written and clear, no problems there.

Rating all RFTG's the same at 9.  Love this game and will play it whenever it comes to the table.  The orb game was interesting, but just too long with 4 people.  Want to try it with 2 or 3.  Still haven't played with prestige points or takeovers.

The first couple of times I played Race for the Galaxy I thought it was a good game but not great. Then, I sat down with a few other guys who were big gamers (though they had never played this game before) and I taught them how to play. I discovered as I taught them all of the strategies involved with playing this game and really grew to love this game! It is a blast and I am now scoring twice as many points as I was before discovering the strategies. What a great game!

11-15-2014: I initially had this at a 6 after playing one game last summer. We played it again recently and it seemed to go much smoother, I guess since I had a much better handle on the rules. I'm not sure we would ever own this ourselves, but playing this with friends who know it well, it is an enjoyable, quick game.

Fun game, but I would enjoy it much more if they didn't rely so much on all those obtuse symbols. Using the symbols is fine, but it would be [i]really helpful[/i] if the cards also told you what they did in straightforward text. There is plenty of room for a bit of text on most of the cards; they already have clarifying text on many of the cards, so it just looks lazy for the rest of the cards to have no text at all.

Some of the cards feel a bit abstract, too, but I guess that's to be expected in a card game like this.

Besides that, I think it's great game. It actually feels pretty thematic most of the time, and I love the setting of this game (and really don't care for the setting of Puerto Rico). Too bad its a chore to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
One of my favourite games of all time. Absolutely brilliant. Elegant design, fast and immensely fun to play. Works well with many different player counts and is very portable - a must game to take with you anywhere!

I first rated it 10, but later took the rating down a notch as the base game gets a bit dry after dozens of plays and once you learn it, the Consume-Produce strategy is the surefire way to go. The base game alone thus falls a bit short of the absolute perfection that is required of a 10.. I'd still give it [size=14][BGCOLOR=#00CC99][COLOR=#00CC00]_[/COLOR][size=8][b]9.5[/b][/size][COLOR=#00CC99]_[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR][/size]

Expansions have added immensly to the game, however. The first one is great, the second one too, and the third one adds some very interesting cards to the mix.

However, the prestige rules of the third expansion completely break the game. They're so awful I never play with them anymore and have removed the cards and goals that deal with them from the game. The only things I use from the 3rd expasion are 3 start worlds, 1 goal and 28 cards. The deck is starting to get somewhat unwieldy after three expansions in any case.

Played with the best parts of the expansions (or even with just the first expansion), I simply cannot give the game anything but a [size=14][BGCOLOR=#00CC00][COLOR=#00CC00]_[/COLOR][size=2][COLOR=#00CC00]_[/COLOR][size=8][b]10[/b][/size][COLOR=#00CC00]_[/COLOR][/size][COLOR=#00CC00]_[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR][/size]

Keldon's AI (available online for free) is incredible and a great way to play the game against AI opponents. Helps tremendously in learning to play the game competitively too. I have probably around 1000 plays against the AI (I don't log these) and still never grow tired of playing this game.

RATING: 10
I'm drawn to this again and again, yet don't fully appreciate the game. Have only played it solitaire, and that may indeed be a factor. The robot in the expansion is formidable, having won roughly 80%-90% of all games played... so it does appear to be quite the challenge to defeat.

I'm experimenting with several other solo options for this game -- those posted here on BGG are very good. They're more fun than the clobbering I endure at the hand of the robot, that's for sure.

;)

UPDATE: I consider myself very well experienced with this title at this point, and it's one of the finer titles in my collection. It's full of interesting decisions that matter, a short playing time, and the desire to say, "Let's do that again!"

Dropped from 9->8 due to recent expansions lose some of the cohesion of the cards, also I became more and more frustrated in explaining this game to new (or even returning players) - symbols galore! A very good game (base + 2 expansions at least) but just too much tedium in explaining it - hence playing.

Update from 8-7, a bit disenchanted of the game even with the base + first expansion, still is a bit chaotic for my taste. Could also be I have just played it too many times and a bit burned.

Possibly the most fun you can have in the least amount of minutes in 2 player form. Without a doubt hard to learn (see San Juan below as a way to get your head around the basic mechanics before proceeding directly to takeovers in the 3rd expansion!). A wonderful 2 player game and the expansions only add more layers without unbalancing it (though the 3rd expansion does change the game). FYI - My gf normally wipes the floor with me at this game. :-(

EDIT - Upgraded the game to a 10 after first few multi player games Jan 2012.

Oh, and we prefered to remove prestige and goals and remove some cards from the expansions, since the basic game mechanic is already great enough (less is more according to us)

Very fun, love the sci-fi theme.  I would probably like it better if I hadn't played San Juan first, as it's not as elegant.  The multiple versions of some of the roles really irritates me.  However the added paths to victory and complexity of which decisions are best make it still a great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Initial view after just one play, so too early to form any real judgement. Enjoyed the theme and the added complexity but it has likely lost the marvellous simplicity of SJ. It certainly felt pretty solitaire which was compounded by the fact that we couldn't easily see what cards the other players had laid. Contrast SJ where its easy to see who has played what, and how your choices will aid or constrain them. Clearly familiarity with the icons is necessary before giving a considered rating.

Played 2 players twice tonight - the icons are pretty much fine and it's a better game with 2 players rather than 4 I think. How the forthcoming expansions with added players will fare will be interesting to see. I still have a feeling that the game is a touch fiddly for what it is, and the player interaction (at least in the base game) remains limited. It's partly my advancing years that lead me to like vanilla best, so SJ will likely remain my favourite of the two!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I have a very conflicted relationship with this one. The theme is great, the graphics are great, even the game-play is pretty great... and yet, the game is presented in a very user-unfriendly way - in my view, this game could have been a solid ten if they had used fewer icons and more text to convey the game-play information. As it is, I am mostly playing against Keldon's AI (which is great, by the way). 

Addendum: what's really great about the game are the many paths to victory - there are lots but you have to pick one and stick by it. Jacks of all trade will lose horribly. IMO, this is this game's unique selling point, most other games in the genre offer 2-3 and the rest is optimization... this game offers more, especially with the first expansions (more expansions make it bloated imo).

Interesting game, a huge number of options makes it very confusing to begin with.  The first game took 1.5 hours!  Alex says it goes down to 20 minutes, but I think that would hugely depend on the players.  Sometimes you had buckets of cards to sort and discard.  I didn't seem to be able to get any cards that would give me points (I didn't really know how to get points until half way through, which probably explains it!) and I'm not sure of a strategy at all.  I'd play again, but it's more "Whenever" than "When, when when?!?"

This game just isn't that fun to play. At first, it was terribly difficult to grok, although after introducing it to a few folks, gamers seem to get it pretty quickly. In brighter light, the brown/orange color blind problem is much less although still annoying. But for me it reduces itself to a random puzzle game: you play the hand you're dealt and after that, it greatly depends on the cards you get with the advantage going not to skill, but knowledge of the deck - a trait I particularly dislike in a game. Yes, there are important decisions, but I believe it's much more based on luck favoring the prepared. It is Magic the Gathering without deck building. Is that a great game? I don't think so at all. Ironically, Dominion is the opposite: deck building without any difficult or interesting cards. Dominion works for me, this one simply does not.

It was ok, but there's quite a high learning curve with all of the icons and bits and bobs on the cards.

It's not really my type of game.  It works well enough, but I'm not much into space and I found it a bit lacking in interaction.

Still, a second play may well raise my score, although I'm not sure that will ever happen.

+ very deep experience in a short playing time (best depth per minute ratio I've ever seen)
+ huge replay value
+ plays very fast
+ it's very addictive

+ It has a lot of expansions (all are good), but don't make the mistake to rush and get them all at once. Let the game take it's time, and gradually add them one by one. The game will tell you when it needs new twists.

- the first time you play it you'll need about 10-15 plays to get the iconography out of the way, but after that ... it flies

So, after watching my friends play this a couple of times, I finally had enough time today to join in (we played this during our lunch break at work.)

It is an interesting game with lots of good Sci-Fi names and elements that I recognize from a plethora of book series.  

Yes, the symbols are absolutely crazy and not exactly intuitive to get a grasp of, yet I managed fairly well.  There were questions the first time the different parts of play came around, but it wasn't that hard for me to grasp.

I started with a hand that was filled with military cards, so I ran with that.  And while I came in third place with 25 points, I didn't do completely terribly for my first time playing.  Especially since the winner had only 53 points from mining.  Next time I might try for mining.  If I get the cards.

Well, still haven't tried for mining as I just haven't gotten the cards.  Am getting slowly better as I understand what all the symbols and colors mean.  I ended last game with 29 points - a far cry from winning but clearly making steady progress!

OK, played again, and while I had a rough start (with many terrible cards) I ended up in second place with over 30 points!  Yes!  Clearly, understanding the importance of the 6-point developments changes the game dramatically!  I still feel I'd need a few more plays to really get the strategy down, but I'm feeling much better about this game overall.

I lowered my rating for this game as time has gone by.  It's still a good game, but it just doesn't do as much for me as it once did.  Not entirely sure why... just didn't continue to grow on me as other games have.  (Note: I've only had one chance to play with the expansion, more play with it may rekindle my interest.)

Essen 07. Expensive for the components, but this is an incredible game. We played one test game and bought it immediately, it becoming a staple game in the evening game sessions. Great variety and constructive feel, improving on San Juan in every way.
My only niggle is that given the victory chips exist and the game therefore breaks that "everything is a card" rule, they should have provided cubes or chits for the goods. It's a pain having to use cards since unlike San Juan, a lot of the production cards have additional abilities.

It might be really fun and good game when you understand the logic of it, but when everyone has to say your all steps for you, because you can not grasp its system, then it is better to train on other games till you are experienced enought to understand it. :)
Tried once and managed somehow this way, but on the second try left the game on second move. I'm probably just not ready for it.

I need to find someone to play this with. Played with my fiance maybe 4 times, she couldn't get down on it. It just never really clicked with her and she more or less said "I don't want to play this anymore". So it's been sitting on my shelf for a while. I'd like to get some more plays in and find out why everyone raves about how great this game is.

Very good. Not so much a development of San Juan as the full, original, non-dumbed-down version. It seems too short for reasonable exploitation of all card features. Some player interaction, so "multi-player solo" doesn't apply here, given the comparison of other games where it does. Some of the 6-developments appear not to work, or ever be chosen, and other cards may fall into that category also. The major downside is that you cannot plan easily, and neither is there the time to do so. Expensive for a card game.

Scales almost perfectly, multiple paths to victory, plays well with 5 (not random like 7 wonders), has strategy but with a need to be flexible, tactics, quick 30 minute games... once you get the hang of the iconography and basic strategy there isn't much not to like.

Love the mechanic of this game, it seems so simple but I know many struggle to understand it.  One 2-player game I ended up going round in circles just doing the same thing round after round because my cards had created a victory point machine.  I considered removing a couple cards, can't remember which now, but decided it was better left alone for the times that it might be an issue.

I want to give it more trying, and I'll probably change my rating in the future.

An objectively good game with a nice theme and good mechanics.  My friends all love it, but I'm just awful at it and find it hard to explain why.  No matter how well I think I'm playing, I seem to land around 24 points, a good 20-30 under the other players.  I think I might be bad at finding card synergy.

Update: I'm starting to be able to play this a little bit better.  I'm learning how paralyzing it is to play an expensive card early in the game when it doesn't help your early-game card drawing.  I still totally suck, and when it comes out, I just play to try to become better, because I know there's no way I'm going to win against my group.

A really good game, not many people seem to play it now that it has so many expansions and the learning curve is set high for those who've played it a lot. I don't like playing with new players anymore because it would take too long.

I like all the expansions but I don't plan on owning it, far too much money for a card game that the only people who I know who would like playing it, already own it.

Edit: Caveat. Finding a complete copy in the marketplace for a good price and getting a lot of 2 play action out of it.

Played once.  This game has a lot of potential.  I wish it had some direct screwage or at least something to reduce that multiplayer solitaire feeling.

[1-6] My favorite game at the moment.  Used to play Magic the Gathering and this game reminds me of a great, balanced CCG.  However, the play is incredibly polished and the strategy is surprisingly deep.  My wife and I have had a great time dueling for a while and then being surprised with who's strategy prevailed.  Also, having everything be simultaneous really works wonders.  It's a competitive space game that nearly feels cooperative.

This "game" blows so many chunks that you could erect a Eurogame monument from those chunks, which, while gross, would be quite appropriate.

This game is no "race."  It has nothing to do with space.  Like most Eurogames' it has nothing to with anything.

Here, ya want to save a lot of money?  Go to Walmart and buy 4 sets of playing cards.  Have 3 friends come over.  Everyone play solitaire.  At the end, see who scored the highest.  That's it.  I just saved you about $30 (USD).  You're welcome.

Fun?  No.  If your Walmart decks of cards had pictures of dinosaurs on them, it would be WAY more fun than Race for the Galaxy, but that's not fair: dinosaurs do those things and this game has no dinosaurs.

You know what else sucks about this game?  I have a mighty military (also known as "red" cards).  You are a bunch of peace loving hippie beatnecks.  I come over and demand that you pay tribute and if not, then I will conquer some of your planets filled with long haired weirdos.  Huh?  I can't.  Why not?  I have lasers!  I have disruptors, photon torpedoes.  You have Joan Baez and a guitar.  I'm about to implement some Pax Instersellerica on you, but I can't do it.  Why?  Because the rules say I can't interact with you.  I guess we are on opposite sides of the galaxy or something.  Huh?  Then how are we able to play off of the same roles?  How can there be a victor?  Because this game just sucks.

Defenders of this corpse are quick to point out to me that if I go buy a bunch of expansions, THEN, I actually get to, you know ... interact with you.  Really?  That proves how much this game sucks.  It's an acknowledgement that you have to spend a bunch of money just to make it not suck as much -- AND THERE STILL AREN'T ANY DINOSAURS!!!!

So if you are a sad Eurogamer who can't break free, I'll help you out.  If you want a game using these mechanics, go play San Juan.  It's way more fun.  If you want something more challenging than San Juan, skip this turd and play Glory to Rome.  This game just blows, no matter what type of gamer you are.

One of my favorites from the first time I played.  At first the game rules seem fairly complex but once you start playing things are fairly self explanatory.  Still, it definitely helped to have someone around who had played the game multiple times to explain things.  The game involves collecting cards, spending cards as money, and creating a tableau of up to 12 cards.  There is no direct player vs player conflict so this is a nice contrast to games where you are constantly fighting people over the same territory.  The game allows for multiple strategies to win which makes it quite fun to adapt to the cards you are dealt.  Each game takes about 1.5 hours.

This is a good card game. It is quite eye-boggling at first; as many have said, the iconography is daunting. But if you seek out a youtube video or two of how to play this game, 15-30 minutes later you will be primed for an easy play through!
Two knocks...
1) I don't see much of the "engine" development. Card draws are pretty random. Maybe if I would do more "Look at 5 and Keep 1" Explore phases I would feel more in control of my destiny and less controlled by luck of the draw.
2) OH MY GOD THE TEXT ON THE CARDS IS FREAKING TINY. Seriously, reprint these cards, TODAY. How one earth did anyone think this was sufficient? -2 points off my Rating for this game due to terrible card font.

RATING: 10
The game balance/card balance is a godsend.  We can really see the fruits of the efforts spent on design and playtesting.  It is really amazing that there are so many different cards with different powers, yet none seems too strong or too weak (for their costs).  In this aspect RtfG has surpassed even Puerto Rico and San Juan.  Because the card balance is good and the cards are so varied, you can play many intricate combos besides the obvious ones, so the game has lots of variations and hence, longevity.  Being a card game with admittedly some luck, this game may not be very good as a /competition/ (GIPF project games do that better, for example), but as a game and /entertainment/ I couldn't ask for more.

RATING: 10
I love this game!  There are a number of subtle strategies and techniques.  There's a lot to be said for either using a strategy from which your opponent(s) can't leech or using a strategy that leeches from your opponent(s).  Some games, it really does become a race to win.  I'm enjoying this more and more and expect to keep enjoying it for the foreseeable future.  I'm also rather addicted to it.  (Race anyone?  Race?)

ADDENDUM:  While I understand Race may not be for everyone (steep learning curve, mucho symbology to learn, lots to figure out), it is definitely my game of choice.  Deep gameplay and the many, varied options and strategies keep me coming back.  At +100 plays, I will gladly play more and I feel like I'm still picking up various nuances.

I can't wait for the expansions!  (Seriously, I can't wait.  WTT [insert something extremely precious and valuable] for an advanced copy.  Void where prohibited by law, good taste or insobriety.)

This rating is for the base game (i.e., without expansions).  I played the base game a lot (looks like 224 plays) and came to enjoy it.  The expansions, even the first one with only 22 more cards, dramatically change the game.  The strategies, the directions, the feel -- they just play differently.  Some elements are improved while others are diminished.  (4/09/09)

NOTE (10/02/13):  Base game is excellent!  It really is fantastic on its own.  1st expansion is okay but not solid.  2nd expansion fleshes things out further and is very good.  3rd (final) expansion is the icing on the cake.  The combined product (base + 3 exp) is excellent!!!  Still, I rate the base a 10 and the others less (8-9) because the base alone is a complete, and wonderful, game all on its own.

The game itself plays really well,but the graphics are a major drawback.Watchman - like artwork [not to everybody's taste] is put well ahead of legibility.I needed a magnifying glass to read some of the icons and print on my own cards - let alone anyone else's across the table.                                A second edition is warranted here,in which playability is given priority over artwork.MTG manages both - it can and should have been done with this otherwise excellent game.

RATING: 8.5
This is really growing on me, though I haven't played it much.  It's probably the game I'm most up for at the moment.

Update: still a lot of fun.  As for the expansions, I'm less sure about some aspects of them.  I can see the argument that goals (from The Gathering Storm) add to the necessary skill, but they don't make me jump for joy.  (It may be something as trivial as the fact they aren't printed on cards - I'm not normally a sucker for aesthetics like that, but I detect a trace of that feeling here.)  And so far takeovers (from Rebel vs Imperium) have been a bit of a dud.

Update: still enjoying this one a lot, though it's tailing back a bit.  I feel that diminishing returns have kicked in with RvI, especially with the takeovers mechanism which is generally a lot of fuss over nothing in a two player game (the number I generally play at).  In live play, base+tGS is about as fun and much less fiddly than the whole shebang (and I very much like just the base set along - it's very elegant).  Kudos to Tom Lehmann for okaying the dissemination of Keldon's AI, by the way.  Hopefully it's been a smart business decision.

Update: Unfortunately, the Brink of War expansion means this one isn't getting to the table with my group as often as it should.

Update: The base game, plus Gathering Storm, is a fine game that still holds up, but that's in part because we're not playing the bejinkers out of it.  RvI and BoW are expansions that only seem to come into their own if you scale further learning gradients and get everyone to roughly the same plateau; while I can see the fun there, my group aren't going to end up doing that.  Hopefully Alien Artifact will be accessible as well as a whole new arc...

RATING: 10
Why I think you should play this:

*Effectively boils down the 'space opera' experience into a < 60 mins experience. There's diplomacy (role selection), military and industry (production). There's exploration, expansion (develop/settle), exploitation (trade/consume) and even extermination if you want it (takeovers). 

*The theme is immersive if you let it be. The art is original, slick and consistent. The backdrop gives intrigue to the development of personal fiefdoms without being overpowering. I actively enjoy linking my empire of random cards with a backstory. It's there. 

*The player dynamics are subtle, but also ingenious. The role selection mechanism allows players to gain from guessing opponent actions, but doesn't impede players from doing what they want without engaging in mindgames. 

*This is a quiet game of min-maxing, and I think it's relatively quick-playing time, combined with its depth of possibilities, has made me uninterested in exploring space operas or economic games in general. I've played thousands of times, and still very much enjoy it. 

Why I might not recommend this:

*The expansions add a lot to this game, and my sweet spot is somewhere between the first and second expansions (though all are good in different ways). While the cards aren't imbalanced, the expansions each prioritise different things, and sometimes it can be hard to find players who see eye-to eye on what sort of experience they want from this game. I find the 2-player game much, much different from the multiplayer.

[With Gathering Storm, which I like for solo play, perhaps better than the "real" game, but not that much]

After a while, it becomes dry, and even the expansion boost to military leaves produce/consume dominant.  Meh.  It's fun solitaire.

I think if you like it enough to become very good, and play against someone who does the same it may be a solid enough game.  But between very occasional players it's pretty darn luck-ish.  And becoming good is a great deal a matter of card knowledge we don't like it enough to acquire.

RATING: 8
Good game. Pictogram system is very well designed, but takes a while to learn (then again, the good stuff usually does). It does get a bit repetitive after a while, but I suspect that the expansions would fix that by expanding the diversity of cards available. the lack of interaction with the other players is also a minus. I have heard that the expansions work to fix this, but i suspect that there is only so much you can do, given the mechanic. 

I also appreciate that the company was willing to lend out the rights to all the card images to enable people to develop the computerized version of the game.

I havent been this excited by a game in 2 years.  This is the real Puerto Rico card game, imo.  I feel it is better than San Juan in pretty much every way (And I really like San Juan).  I've only played a couple times so far but I'm desperate to play it more.  I love how much variety there is in the cards and theyre abilities, and how this wide variety of abilities is neatly expressed on the cards with simple and intuitive symbols.  I love the variety in the large scoring 'buildings', and how they do something cool as well, so its ok to build them earlier.  I like how there are different strategies in the game, but you cant just do the same one every time, you have to do one that works with the cards and homeworld that youve drawn.

Masterpiece of contemporary game design. A dense, subtle engine building game packaged in a bundle of cards that you can take and play anywhere.

It plays fast and forces you to check what others are doing to beat them in the race. No direct take that, so great for conflict averse players (and for the others teach them to read their opponents).

The quintessential desert island game. And with the first expansion, it has a very innovative solo module. No game is perfect for everybody, but this one hits all the right buttons for me and fires on all cylinders.

This game unquestionably makes San Juan redundant. I like it better for three reasons

1. The simultaneous action selection and resolution makes the game much faster.
2. The massive variety means there are many more options.
3. Unlike San Juan, I always feel there is something useful I can do.

The first time we opened this we played it four times in a row. That has never happened for any other game I've played. Then I played it a total of 19 times over a week and a half, without playing any other game in the interim. The last time I got that obsessed about a game was when I first bought Settlers of Catan.

I'm not a solid player, but it is still a nice casual game due to the social skills needed in choosing which Actions you'd like for that round. I love how it is almost like solitaire. Pro: Losing is the best, and I feel great when the winner takes a solid win. Con: I'm a fan of the SciFi Space Flight genre, but the immersion sucks here. Pro: I really enjoy games where cards are used as mana/resources, see Summoner Wars.

Race for the Galaxy is a game whereby players try to build and develop the most prosperous galaxy among the players.  Players are able to Explore, Develop, Settle, Consume and Produce actions to help them to build their galaxy.

In each round, players are able to choose 2 actions.  Only actions that are chosen by players are conducted in the round.  For players who chose the specfic actions, privileges are given to players during the action phase.  The game will end if all the victory chips are awarded or any player has played 12 cards.

Good points: Many different combination of cards that can help to earn victory points.

Bad points: The game depends too much on luck.  If the cards drawn cannot combine to what players have played previously, then the game can be frustrating.  If cards that are able to combine are drawn together, then players will have a hard time choosing which cards to play.

Race for the galaxy is probably as good as card games get. You choose an action per turn and this can be to draw cards or lay cards in front of you, or even produce goods on your planet cards and sell them for victory points or other cards. Its a really hard game to learn since it is all about card combinations but if you see a copy get it for yourself and put some time into learning this superb game. You won't be disappointed.

Update: Sleeved. Trading as don't have any opponents regular enough to justify cupboard space.

Still feeling this one out, as it has a respectable learning curve.  It has been slow going so far discovering its nuances.  The solo expansion is very cool and very tricky.  I do plan to play much more.  Hopefully against humans.  The art is also top notch.

Update: After deciphering the martian iconography the game play is starting to shine.  Really great theme and implementation.  Probably not a gateway game. ;)

- Price is too expensive.
- Disagree with expansion politics of the designers.

A game that relies on symbols, so there is a big learning curve.  Once you learn them however, they appear simple.  Lot's of different strategies to win depending on the luck of the cards you draw vs. phases that do occur each round.  Like many card games your strategy changes based upon the cards you get.  So it's hard to follow the same strategy twice.

I played Puerto Rico a total of two times before picking this game up. Having the base of Puerto Rico offered in such a refreshing theme and timely manner was amazing for me (and my gaming group). This is a game that has made it possible for my gaming group to return to Puerto Rico and start playing the game with out the head swirling-headache feeling they complained about in their first go around.

Part of this is because the learning curve on Race is so steep. The iconography is really something to be admired once it can be deciphered. It's elegant gameplay and multiple paths to victory make this game great.

The time in which you can achieve all of this depth in fun (30-45 mins) makes this a must have. We rarely play just one game of this.

Race for the Galaxy would've been a cozy 7 or 8 had the victory conditions not been pants-on-head stupid. But then, it would've had to be called "Galactic Empires" or something. It's a race, sure, but it doesn't exactly feel like a race so at no point during the several games I played of this did I feel any need to hurry.

In engine-builder games, you often want to end it a bit early before things just get swingy and out of control. This serves to make people want to play again as well as stop it from being unbalanced. Unfortunately, RFtG took this overboard and ends the game after it barely starts, at least for 2 players. Pretty much everything about this game lends itself to something with twice as many victory requirements, and even testing with those made it feel tight. So RFtG is less a tight game and more someone walking in on you masturbating at random--no one has fun and you're done way before you finish.

If not for this singular problem, RFtG would be one of the top games in my entire collection. And this is despite the "graphic design" looking like they paid a hobo in sandwiches to scribble in MSpaint. Which is a shame because the art is fi--hahahaha no I'm kidding, the art is dogshit too. Pretty much everything has been run through a disgusting photoshop filter to somehow remove all the color, or worse, change it to all one color. You'll be amazed at how lazy the colored strategy cards were.

I do think Settle-nonmilitary is one of the weakest things in the game, along with Explore's blatant and frankly disgusting lack of support. 

Overall, if you absolutely have to play this game, be open to the idea of your eyes bleeding and needing house rules for any enjoyment. Once you toss out the clearly untested end conditions, you'll find a really comfy tableau-builder waiting for you.

Easily gets an 8 if they ever release a rule anywhere, even on their website, that allows for a long game variant. Instant 10 if they also release an update that fixes the godawful card frames and monocolor art.

I'm not a sci-fi fan.
I'm not a card game fan.
I dislike games that are multi-player solitaire....and, hands down, Race for the Galaxy is the gold medal winner for multi-player solitaire.
Yet with those three major strikes against it (for me), RftG is still a very good game! Unlike a card game like Dominion, the theme actually works with the mechanics. And the art! My goodness, the art is beautiful.
So I rate it a 7.95. However, I suspect that if I were either a), a sci-fi fan, or b) a card game fan, my rating would be well past an 8. If I were BOTH a) and b), RftG would almost certainly be a 9 for me!
And, for the record, for those who compare Race for the Galaxy with San Juan and Puerto Rico, I have this to say: you don't play enough of a variety of games! RftG is similar to these two games in only the most general of ways.

Fantastic game. After two plays I was hooked solid. I normally don't have a good filler option, since I don't much like the light fare, and the games of the weight I like usually take 2-3 hours (1-10 for extreme cases). This works as a filler, being so short, but also as a main game of a session, as it has plenty of both strategic and tactical thinking. Awesome, and most people I introduced it to were impressed. I believe it will be played many more times. Like RoboRally, it scales perfectly without prolonging the play.

I've played it a few times. I actually prefer Roll for the Galaxy, which is similar in theme and action-selection, but very different mechanically. I find Race is somewhat counterintuitive, though those who like games in which you have to make conflicting decisions about which cards to keep or spend will probably like this one better.

This is an excellent game, with oodles of depth and ways to win. At first glance, it seems that you're subject to the randomness of the card draw, but you soon realise that you can mitigate that randomness through reading your opponents and making well thought through plays. 

In this game, like in many others, it pays to follow a different strategy from your opponents, and to specialise once you decide what you're doing.

Played once when it first came out, and once again a year later.

If you play by the 12 card in-play limit, games can be very quick.  Seems to be little point in acquring VP's - instead, it's a rush for the end.  Perhaps that is the intention of the game, hence the name: Race for the Galaxy.  

First time we played (4 player) we didn't see the card in-play limit.  The game ended up being really long, as it took awhile to exhaust all the VP's in the pool.  We really felt like we were developing an empire though.  When we implemented the 12-card limit, everyone was a bit disappointed with how fast the game went.  I guess my group just likes long drawn out development style games.

But, deck knowledge is such a huge boon in RftG that unless all the players have an equal number of plays, those who know the deck win more than their share of the time.

Adding a 5th and 6th player and the goals is also a nice feature.

For the sake of brevity, I'll summarize here: Race for the Galaxy is pretty much the perfect game.  It's an unforgiving, thinky, brutal multi-use card game where you're trying to claw an engine together faster than your opponent and ride that engine to victory.  The cards are fantastically designed and well-balanced, and the gameplay leads heavily to trying to understand and take advantage of your opponent's phase calls.  Tons of indirect player interaction, and a good mix of strategy and tactics (though leaning towards tactics, there's definitely both).  Combine this with great art and visual design and a ten-minute playtime and we have a winner.

For plays, counting a combination of BGA, Keldon's, and offline in that order of quantity.  However, each component is still pretty sizeable.

The symbols make this game look exceedingly complex. It's actually a lot simpler than it seems - providing you're already familiar with San Juan.

(Our most common mistake was trying to play a military world in the settler phase as if it's a non-military world.)

2-4(2,4)

The deck bloat is sort of getting to me. For this type of game, I'm actually gravitating toward San Juan, where you know all the cards and can form a strategy and actually have some expectation of getting the cards needed to execute the strategy.

With Race, not only is the iconography just an added wrench (not a problem for me, personally, but it makes it much tougher to introduce to others) but it's hard to know which cards fit into which strategy and the giant deck can be quite fickle.

I'm not sure how often this will be getting played these days.

Just played with Jaggedtech (Greg) and Niall.  Very similar to San Juan except you get bonus if you played the stage.  Have to play a few more time, definitely a hand management game.  Icon are kind of confusing and take a bit used to.
The second time was better, figured out a strategy based on the opening hand and developed from there.
Actually got in a win via military.  The expansion added some goals card which can affect your final score.

From Game Kastle Flea Market for $20 on 11/07/09.  Lightly played.

Tried out the produce-consume and it didn't quit work as expected since both Greg and Phil went for Military which I totally ignored.  Perhaps I need to balance with a little of military.

7/10/10 Finally replay this with the group after figuring the error we did in the past. Much better with both expansion (more home worlds)  The Goals are very nicely done and can influence your play style.

Transplant the mechanics of San Juan to a galaxy far far away and give the cards some excellent, sci-fi artwork.  Increase the number of different cards in a similar-sized deck from 29 to 95.

RATING: 9.5
Race for the Galaxy is a very good game that turns into a Masterpiece when you include the expansions and start correctly. (Correct start w/ Expansions: each player dealt 1 red and 1 blue start world + 6 other cards - keep 4 cards and 1 start world).  Without expansions I rate the game ~8.

Nuances (not really negatives): 
 - The game has a steep initial learning curve.
 - Many people take 5 to 10 games to explore and understand the main strategies.
 - With expansions there are a lot of cards to become familiar with (and deal). 
 - Player interaction is predominantly tied to action selection. 

Brilliance: 
 - No other game has as much strategic breadth, meaning that there are so many different ways to win.
 - Plays great with 2 players or a group.
 - Simultaneous player action selection keeps the game intriguing and fast paced.  
 - Balance of strategy (tied to start conditions) and tactics (tied to card drawing).  
 - So much variation that at 100+ games I'm still learning and exploring!

Gameplay is a 10, but it loses a mark or two just because it's a steep ramp up to get there.  My guys are used to Magic cards, which tell you exactly how to play each card.  RTFG is the opposite.

RATING: 7
I picked this up (along with the expansion) in my quest to find a decent solo game that didn't take a ton of time to play or set up.

I find I go through phases with this game.  It'll be really hot for a while and I'll play it almost daily.  And there are times where it will sit weeks/months at a time without being touched.  

I've only played one game with another player (my wife - she was pretty lukewarm about it), so I can't speak too much about the multiplayer aspect of it.  I have played the PC version (by Keldon) quite a bit and have about a 50/50 win ratio vs the AI.  That's pretty fun, but I'd wager it's quite different than human opponents.

Overall, I think this one will be with me for quite a while.

RATING: 7
It's good for what it is, even if what it is isn't always what I'm in the mood for. Yes, player interaction is extremely limited (although there is more of it than you might suspect on first inspection), but its virtues are many: It is fast to play, very well balanced, and offers multiple avenues to victory. Each game I've played has been different and interesting.

Rating after several plays ranging from two to four players.  Excellent if you like complex games or game elements.  This one is prone to forgetting to activate powers on cards on the table that you've played if you're not careful.  Works very well two player and the variety in the deck and numerous paths to victory make this one have wonderful replability.  Haven't tried with the wife yet but she may prefer to play San Juan over Race.  I presonally prefer the complexity of Race.

This game basically replaced San Juan.  The only advantage San Juan has over Race is that it is a more accessible game, though mechanically it is nearly identical.  For players new to both, I think it is actually a good idea to introduce San Juan first and get a few games under one's belt, before tackling Race.

RftG is awesome, once you understand it.  If at first you don't get it, try again.  You will begin to see how much depth it has, but it's deeper than that.  It took me 10 plays before I was really into it.  By virtue of the solo computer version, I must have played 1000+ games now.

revised rating after several more plays.  I'm finally getting more comfortable with this game but the learning curve and iconography is still incredibly steep.

I can see that there are multiple paths to victory and that exploring them all would appeal to many, just no so much for me, I fear.

A game I'll happily play now, but wouldn't go out of my way to choose.  May improve with more plays.

RATING: 8
I personally really like the graphics on the cards and the game-play in general. It's also great as a 2-player game. However the cards are jacked up with symbols which you need to remember (or constantly refer to your cheat-sheet) and it can take a lot of games to really remember what all the symbols mean and how the cards can be used. Maybe I'm just a little slow, but I've played it around 3-4 times so far and since the times I've played have been so far between, I feel like I'm re-learning it every time.

Great game, easy to learn, fast, interactive. I played the game in 2, 3 and 4 players (no expansions) and it makes sense in each case, the strategy is different and the game gets quicker to play with the increase in the number of players.

It is one of the classics, I cannot wait to get a few expansions and see what they can offer.

RATING: 5
First, I do understand the icons, and have played probably 30-40 games.  This is definitely a solitare game, though I like the goals as they make you more aware of the other players (though you can ignore the goals and still win sometimes), not interacive mind you, just aware that there are others playing.  Action selection has the only interaction and it isn't that important most of the time.  also, you can look to make sure your opponent doesn't have the card you need already in his area.  
The luck of the draw wins for players of the same expeirence.  This ramdonmess can make long term strategy detremental.  Funny, the randomness in San Juan and St. Petersburg add tension... here they just frustrate because there are times when you need certain cards, or resources and they just don't come.
I do think it's fun in small though and like building the engine.

Iconography is ridiculously hard to understand at first.  Now that I have it down, the game isn't that impressive.
also, it is very easy to forget to do things in this game which will lead to losses.  That is, too much to keep track of and it's not really compartmentalized, your tableu is just a giant blob of icons.

Similar to San Juan as is well known, but there is a lot more to the game. Even so I prefer San Juan, there is too much random chaos in this game and it's not quite what I would expect. The cards are good quality, albeit slightly confusing but the game supplies reference cards which clarify things. Good fun, but a huge luck factor exists in this when playing the AI.

I only really enjoy this game with 2players, and even then I feel like it has far too much luck involved.  I love the IDEA of this game, I just don't think it works as well as it could.

RATING: 6.9
I only rate this so low is because I can't get enough games in to learn the symbols properly.  I will say that in the one game in which I had success that I had some very nice combinations.

I like the roll-selection mechanic; but, I don't like having to ask other players what something on a card means.

My rating would go up with a firmer grasp of the cards and more success.

RATING: 10
I tried a couple games of it on the PC using Keldon's AI so I could get a feel for the game before buying it. I was a little confused with how it works, so I'm going to learn San Juan first (JSanJuan), and then will be buying a physical copy of RftG.

6/23/11 - Played my first game with the actual cards and it was pretty rough. I'm glad I played San Juan a lot before RftG, because I would have been completely lost. After my first game, I felt like I wanted to get rid of it and put it up for trade. I'm going to try to stick with it now though and see if it gets better. I'm going to try playing quite a bit with Keldon's AI and online. Right now this is scored a 6.

6/29/11 - We've been playing this online and now we're getting used to everything. I'm going to bump this up from a 6 to an 8.

7/8/11 - We're really getting the hang of this now and I kinda wish I didn't trade it away. This is becoming a lot of fun! Bumped up to a 9.

12/25/11 - Christmas 2011. HB

1/8/12 - Tried the two player advance game for the first time after playing the regular way for over 88 games. It makes the two player game so much better IMO, and I can't see playing the game without using the two player advance rules anymore.

This game took a little while to catch on, but has become one of our favorites. It packs a lot of game into a little space and a short time. Similar enough to Puero Rico to make it easy for us to get the hang of, but it is definitley its own game. It has many viable strategies and has more player interaction than it seems at first.

RATING: 7.8
This was a little mindboggling and I expect the rating to go up with familiarity but I wonder if the other worldly theme and symbols make this seem too abstract?  Horrible to teach to new players.  Takes a couple of games before things start making sense.  But once the synergy hits there's no going back.  Great game that sets you off in new directions every game.

I've played this more than any other game in my collection.  A great game with a lot of detail and lots of tough decisions in a short play time. I like it best as 2 player advanced rules with Gathering Storm and goals. Excellent solo, too (solitaire robot from Gathering Storm).

Contrary to some, I think the iconography is well done and very intuitive. And I find that the cards are quite thematic and well-named. 

Bumping it back to a 10 because it is still fun after all this time.

Pros: 
- Very quick game
- Variety in the way it plays
- Good depth of strategy despite the fact that the decisions you make are mostly tactical.

Cons: 
- A little overpriced for the components you get (mostly cards which are very cheap), but ok otherwise.
- Very little player interaction.

Summary: A quick, balanced and deep game. What's not to like?

Update 4/8/2012
After playing many games with keldon's AI, things look a little one sided. Production/consume is more powerful without the expansions than other strats. 
Lowering Grade to 8. I still rate it a 9 with Gathering Storm.

A decent card-game filler, but there are similar games out there which I'd still prefer to play over this (Glory to Rome).  Not terrible, but doesn't grab me as it used to and feels a little too luck dependent.  The iconography makes it a bit cumbersome to explain to new gamers and there are plenty other simultaneous action selection games out there which are far more interesting (and easier to explain).  Having said that, apart from my feelings on the "real" version, I do enjoy it a lot as a solo computer game.

We were dubious about this one until we watched Rahdo run through it. Then we were hooked. It gives you a sci-fi theme in a brilliantly designed card/hand management game. So interesting to sit there and try to figure out the best way to play your own cards and how to play off your opponents. There is one major problem though and no doubt you can guess what that is if you've played the game. That iconography is physically painful at times trying to figure out what you should be doing. I understand trying to make a game language independent but this one falls way short of success. And with games like Eminent Domain and Star Realms this one is taking a huge dive.

Brilliant design.

It's not really unique, for it borrows most of the concepts from Puerto Rico/San Juan. But, IMO, it's the best of the three in terms of creating an experience with more options and paths to victory. 

The theme is sort of glued with bubble gum on this one, but it doesn't matter that much given the sort of experience it provides to the players in terms of strategy, options to piggyback on what your opponents are doing and the huge variety of cards provided by the expansions. This is one of those games in which the expansions really add a lot to the experience without bringing unnecessary complexity.

The only problem with this game when compared to San Juan or PR is that it's not easy for a newbie to absorb all the icons and what they mean for the gameplay. 
Because of this, this one definetly has a steeper learning curve than that of its other cousins.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Okay, so it has a lot of symbols, but they are well done, so that doesn't cause confusion.  Fast-paced role-selector with a theme that fits.  At first it doesn't feel as interactive with the other players, but then you realize that's where your tactics are flawed.  You need to use the other players' role selections to your fullest advantage.

That said, I think later games have done this better, and are easier to teach or more complete in the base set.

RATING: 10
Talk about a card game, wow.  Race for the Galaxy is amazing.  In the age of deck building economy games trumping all (Dominion), this game shines as a counter example of true brilliance.  It is like San Jaun, only better.  The game is mad with a "build your own economy" theme and loads up on the quirky strategy.  The art and cards will easily make you a fan boy/girl too, they are goofy and inspiring.  The one problem: mind numbingly hard to learn, really.  The symbols on the cards could not be more confusing, however once you 'get it', things start to go smoother.  Warning: this may take three or more games, don't give up!  It is worth it.  Lucky for me, the amazing card art and story kept me plugging away at it till I learned.  Complex goodness it has.  It really does feel like a race to seize this lovable galaxy in 30 mins or less.

San Juan with much more complexity in the card symbols.

This was very enjoyable.  It felt like a more complicated (not necessarily more difficult to play, but there was more going on) version of San Juan, but I think it plays a LOT better, and is really very fun to play.  I, of course, tried for the straight military 'Rebel Crushing' victory, which didn't quite pan out, but I enjoyed every second of it!

This game has a steep learning curve, but once you get the hang of it you can play it five times in the time it would take you to play most games with this much depth and replay value once. Filling your tableau with bizarre worlds and technology is immensely pleasing.

RATING: 9
My initial thoughts were that this is a very well thought out engine-building game with beautiful cards, but more or less multiplayer solitaire.

It took me six games just to start appreciating the possibilities the phase selection has for player interaction, and to get a glimpse on different possible strategies.

As an example, take two 2-player games with my GF:

In the first game, I started with New Sparta (military world), and tried out a card-acquiring strategy (that is, get as many cards into my hands as quickly as possible, then see what I can do with them). I got an alien world pretty early (=goods I can exchange into many cards), and went with a military strategy that scored my 40 points and a clear victory.

In the second game, I started with Old Earth, which made it more interesting for me to produce and consume goods for VPs. However, I had some cheap but nice developments on hand that I hoped would help me later in the game (they gave me extra cards in development phases). As it turned out, I didn't play a single development after that, so those cards were wasted. Still, I had a good time settling worlds, and got a nice little production-consumption engine running. I ended the game by using up the VP chips, and ended up with 46 VPs, 6 more than in my previous military-oriented game. As it turned out, my GF, with a mixed military-production strategy got to 49 VPs!

One thing I noticed is that I had to select "Production" twice, to produce goods on windfall worlds. My GF with production worlds profited from that.
Another thing was that I used up goods for cards (lots of cards at least, but still), while my GF went "Consume 2x VPs" pretty early. I also would "Settle" very often (had a +2 on non-military worlds development), and my GF used those phases to settle cheap production or military worlds. Using the other player's phases really can make a difference between winning and losing!

In summary:

PROS:
+) Nice, colorful and well-illustrated cards
+) A symbol system that takes some getting used to, but once you know it, you know at a glance what a card will do for you
+) A good engine-building game, with a feeling of growth and achievement
+) Different strategies can yield good results
+) Subtle player interactions, that can still make a difference
+) The fact that cards can be used in two ways (as the card itself, and as generic "money") strongly reduces the problem of "card luck" - every card you draw is valuable, even if only to pay for other cards.

CONS:
-) No direct interaction between players, which turns off a lot of my friends
-) Only up to 4 players (but there are expansions...)
-) Some card luck is involved, especially whether you draw a good 6-point development that fits your tableau and yields you lots of VPs (that alone can make the difference between winning and losing in a tight game).

I really like San Juan (more than Puerto Rico) and this is the next step. Although I don't like the fact that expansions are coming as it looks like it could get dangerously close to semi-CCG territory. Therefore I would probably not invest in this but play it if someone else had it.

The game itself is very fun and very similar to San Juan with just FAAAAAR more options. The art on the cards is just breathtaking and the theme does actually flow into the game nicely.

i think the basics, as reported all over the place, are sure to be at least close to correct.  similar to san juan, simultaneous, engine building, optimization, hand management, etc.  the art is pleasant but undistinctive, and i have difficulty quickly discerning what is on my opponents' boards.  i don't find the lack of interaction to be a problem at all, and i think player targeting via expansions sounds like a bad idea because it could force more board-reading and slow down the game.  i think the game has a ton going for it, but i'm still vexed at the obtuse iconography.  the worst part is going from learning curve to pat hand curve, though, as our group seems to have done.  some are easy to play, others hard.  it's all good for learning, and i have little doubt that expertise can fade it, but i'm still waiting for the part where we all get to sit down and play what i consider to be a fair game and it's frustrating to be teased with the idea of certain situations being tenable when it's entirely possible that they're not.  it makes me want to give san juan another shot.

+ Awesome card game with Puerto Rico's mechanic. Kicks its little brother (San Juan) off the shelf. It clearly has a lot to explore, pun unintended. And I can't see the criticism on the symbols... Who's trying to play this, 3 years old kids? 
- Ridiculously big box.

After plays by 2 and 3 players, I do like the game.  A lot of variety there, and its similarity to Puerto Rico helps.  It goes much quicker when you know what you're doing.  Still waiting on my first play with 4.

The Gathering Storm makes it easier to focus on a strategy, as long as other players also aren't focusing on those strategies.

I play this because my wife enjoys it and it's a good quick game; but as a gaming experience this is still lacking something. Update, ok today I had x2  Development cards that were both giving me double points for the same cards ... that was cool.
Update 2: Much later, this game feels empty for me - interaction perhaps, the game suffers from rote. Once your playing skill caps and your opponent's has also, it is the luck of the draw.

I was worried this game would feel samey with Puerto Rico, but after playing it doesn't feel life PR at all.  If anything, the simultaneous action selection makes it feel more like Citadels.

This game is a lot of fun. If I rated games on fun I'd rate this higher. I see problems here with luck--it's a pretty random game. Also, you must adjust your strategy to whatever starting world you pick up (you are forced by the draw to take on a particular strategy), so it amounts to a hand management game.

I struggled a little bit trying to come up with a score for this game. On the one hand, I often find myself incredibly frustrated by how random it can feel. Games can swing wildly from one turn to the next depending on what's drawn. On the other hand, as I've played more I've found that the random element seems to be favoring me more and more, which tells me there's more to it than "whoops, I drew the right 6-cost development! I win!"

Over the course of the week at WBC 2009, I went from not being particularly interested in the game to wanting to play it as much as I could. I wound up playing in the tournament and made the semifinals, winning three of my games in the qualifying heats and taking second in the fourth.

Short enough to squeeze in those times when we needed to kill some time waiting for someone's event to finish, but long enough to feel worthwhile (I'm looking at you, For Sale), I'm going to make sure to have this one handy whenever I travel with gaming friends.

RATING: 8.5
The more I play, the better I like it.  It will take a few plays to get an understanding of the various card combinations that can be created / used.  There is quite a bit of luck in the card draws, but it is possible to create your own luck by holding onto specific cards at the right time.  Doing this in combination with knowing the possible strategies that can be followed is a key to the game.  A solid game that will likely get better with expansions.

I have actually played this about a dozen times at least with the kids I work with.  They love it and I love playing games like this at work.

I always play with the expansions, but only log plays with the base set. Any logged plays for The Gathering Storm reflect solitaire games that I likely lost.

I got a very short explanation and was thrown in at the deep end. Having no real idea what each card did or what I was trying to achieve left me last and confused. I still did okay score wise I suppose but the frustration of not having a clue what was going on does not encourage me to play again.
I will play if I get to read through the rules first.
Playing again does lead to a better understanding of what is going on.
2010-10 I've been playing against the Keldon AI and now seem to get what's going on, even beating the AI on occasion. Probably won't want to play a lot with the actual set though as it will now seem slow.

This game have two problems, one is the lack of user interaction and the other is the amount of luck involved. It also seems a bit short, but I guess we haven't really gotten the grip of how to play it well. The card images looks fantastic, sadly the frames are the same gray ones on all cards so they are easy to mix up for new players, and there is a ton of symbols to learn. People tend to have a problem separating developments from planets.

Finally played this last night.  We "learned" the icons by playing sample rounds--I highly recommend this way of teaching the game.  

Our sample rounds then turned into an entertaining game, even though we'd originally intended to start over once everyone was comfortable with the icons/rules. The fun factor simply took over as our understanding "clicked in".  

San Juan, but much more strategic.  Great game.

Played a few games and was COMPLETELY bored with it.  Not too complicated, but lacking in player interaction and... fun.  I like San Juan slightly better just because it's shorter, but Glory to Rome destroys both games when it comes to playing-cards-for-roles-and-other-stuff-type games.

I need to play this more to really "get" it, but I can't often find enough other people willing to give it a go.  Part is the symbols give it a higher learning curve, part is that it's just hard to get any kind of cohesive strategy going, and then it's over.

One of my all time favorites.

The best thing about Race for the Galaxy is playing the best you can and then looking back over your tableau and figuring out the story of your empire - a tale of minor conquest to fuel the consumptive demands of swelling populations, or an imperialistic world gradually quelling increasingly unruly and powerful rebels and aliens, or a scientific and commercial society that implemented a variety of developments to excel in all aspects of society.

Additionally, this is the better Puerto Rico, using simultaneous action selection and a deck of cards to get out of PR's practically solved game opening while keeping the role selection vibe strong. I still don't own this personally, but I'm always looking for a good deal on the whole set with expansions. I frequently play against Keldon AI, but I never count online games here!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Revised Review (as of 2015): The systems and design still sparkle, but the base game is just too thin, especially with four players. The expansions add many systems that help mitigate luck and therefore fully flesh out the game and help it achieve the high scores that belie its reputation.


Original Review: A entertaining and tight game with the base set, or a sprawling and brain melting civ-builder with the full set of 1st cycle expansions. Deep game and one that is never not rewarding, especially given how quickly it plays. Brilliant.

Initial rating, based on a single play. Knowing the game well seems like a prerequisite for doing well at the game (and probably for most of the enjoyment in it), as not knowing the potential cards to base a strategy on makes the game feel very luck-based.

A great game, if a bit counter-intuitive. I guess it just needs to be played a couple more times before learning all the different cards (and their interaction), but so far it feels good.

UPDATE: It's a great game that plays in a very short time. It's also great with 2 (I haven't played with more yet). The only downside is it's steep learning curve. It's definitely not a game for casual gamers, and even for gamers it can be a little bit frustrating at times, while learning. That's the only reason why this game is not a perfect 10 for me, and it's very likely to remain a 9 for a long, long time.

UPDATE: I still love it, but finding people to play it with is becoming tougher. There simply is no way to work around those hideous icons. Down to an 8.

UPDATE: A real classic. After all these years, I still want to play it almost all the time. Up a notch, to 8.5.

My thoughts are the same for Roll for the Galaxy: I struggled with it.
The first problem was that the cards are very heavy on icons and I kept finding myself bewildered by what a card might do. The second was the lack of player interaction, which meant it was difficult to pick up by watching what someone else was doing, because you're all puzzling with your own set of cards, which have no influence on the cards of other players, which in any case you can't read from across the table.

Players select a phase.  For the chosen phases all players performs action, with the selecting player getting a bonus.  A close cousin of San Juan.  Tactics and strategy.  I look forward to further plays.  Only quibble is the tiny writing on the cards which are also very dark.  Surprisingly (to me!) this has now overtaken Agricola as what I consider the most impressive game of 2007.

Takes San Juan to the next level.  Deep and satisfying card play with a cool space theme and it all plays in less than an hour.

Takes awhile to completely understand all the simbols, and how the cards work. Since it's in essence a solitaire game, I don't get the 2-4 players, they could have easily included a solitaire version or even a 5th or 6th player in the base game. This was done to sell expansions for sure. Shame on you.
The theme, albeit good, doesn't come across very well. You're just laying down cards, using special powers, and collecting victory points, no flavor text, no story, nothing... just the artwork (which is very good) and card name (for a little theme).

Wifers and I love this game. It's actually in line with all other Rio Grade resource grabbers though so not exactly revolutionary or unique feeling.  It is basically San Jan on Ritalin.  Which after playing San Juan till my fingers hurt (with the expansions no doubt :P) was exactly what the doctor ordered.

So if you've played San Juan and have a good technical grasp on horrifying ideograms than this is the ticket to galaxy awesome.

Great game, but I gave it to a friend who was always the one who wanted to play it. Really love the way your strategy changes each game. Some are races to 12 cards, some are production/consumption fests, some are military based. You have to be very adaptable. 

Takeovers get a big thumbs-down, though- they just seem so rarely useful that they add needless complexity, and when they do happen they just feel silly.

Eddig csak egyet játszottam vele. Az alapszabályok a helyükön voltak, de lehet, hogy néhány apróságot elrontottunk.(legalábbis én így éreztem).
Elsőre nekem túl komplex volt, és a lapok simerete nélkül elég random, de látom, hogy miért lehet érdekes mások számára. (Jól lehet benne kombózni.)  Az tematikája, artworkje is tetszik. alacsony interakció, mindenki a saját pecsenyéjét sütögeti, de ez nem zavaró.

Good game but it's not very interactive with your fellow players, even if you can spot their strategy there isn't much you can do to stop them short of hoarding cards they might want which will scupper your chances as well. Sort of a San Juan in space.

RATING: 5
Mindenképp kellene még játszanom vele, mert előtte többet ígért a játék, nem akarom elhinni, hogy csak ennyi. Zavaróan kevés az interakció, csak pakolgatjuk lefele a kártyákat, szöszmötölgetünk magunk előtt, aztán egyszer csak vége. Ráadásul egy elég primitív stratégiával majdnem meg is nyertem (gyorsan leraktam vagy 5 világot, aztán csak termeltem és kereskedtem végig)... Viszont az, hogy a kártya akár áru és pénz is lehet, tetszik. A játék egyébként meglepően rövid (kb. mint a Dominion), pedig nem a szabály szerint játszottuk, hanem 16 lepakolt lapig.

Megkapta a második esélyt a játék. Nem rossz, de ezek a fajta ikonokkal telepakolt kártyák nálam hendikeppel indulnak, amit még nem sikerült ledolgoznia az rftg-nek:))

I only had the chance (many times actually) to play it on the PC-platform against AI up till now. Playing it live sure was levels away from what I was used to. I totally get why it gets that acclaim from the gaming community. Highly addictive and tons of replayability, somewhat luck-prone as all deck-building/management games are bound to be, but this is good in this case I think, since it makes you follow different strategies, following the twists and turns the cards you draw take you towards. Now for the difficult part: finding a person to play it with :D

Disclaimer -- I playtested this. One of my favorite games of all time, 100 plays and counting. Its simplistic to call this "Super San Juan in Space" (although I've done it). The changes (simultaneous role selection, almost all unique cards, consumption/shipping, and 'big' buildings with powers as well as variable VP) make a highly replayable game. (And I've played San Juan plenty). The # of decisions per unit time are huge. See my review for more details.

I have now played this game 27 times.  20 of those are played only with my wife.  My wife likes the game a lot and so do I.  It was rocky at first as she felt overwhelmed with all the different cards and icons.  It took her 3 games to understand the game.  The biggest hurdle was consume/trade phase.  I like this game because it is so fast for the depth.  That's another reason we played it 20 times already.  We can play it in less than 20 minutes.  Most of the time I am the one slowing her down.  The game is feeling stale because of the limited start worlds.  It is just all in my head though since the start hand really dictates what you'll be doing in the game and that is never the same.  I can't wait for the expansions.  I also wish that someone could come up with a good variant to make any card a start world with the proper price.
Rating: 8

Ok.  I really like this game, especially with our variable starting world variant. This let's you have general plan on what you are going to do since you have more options.  You get to decide what world to play depending on what you have drawn. 

[u]Variable Start World Variant[/u]
--> Draw 7 cards.
--> Settle a world at cost. (Defense = cost)
--> +1 cost for blue windfall
--> +2 cost for brown windfall
--> +3 cost for green windfall
--> +4 cost for yellow windfall
--> +1 cost for Military world of 3+
--> May mulligan but draw 1 less card than prior.  
--> If no production or windfall world, one can mulligan with no penalty.
I can't get enough of this game.

After 80 games and still loving it.  I would play this game over Puerto Rico any day. There is no left/right player binding in this game, which I like a lot.  I don't have this feeling of undeserved wins just because I was to the right or left of the newbie.  This game will remind you of Magic of the Gathering but without the collectable part of it.  You play cards to gain benefits which lends you to do certain strategies but at the same time doesn't feel constricted.  The setup time is virtually zero.  Upgrading to 10!

I had a chance to play this a few more times.  My opinion of it is getting better, its possible my negative view is mostly because of the group that I played with.
- revised -

I feel like I need to explain my rank for this game as its so far from the normal.  I was super excited for this game, and even after the first couple of plays I felt like there was a lot of potential.  Then I played it with a new game group recently and realized the ugly truth.  The other players had obviously played the game many MANY times and had thus laid out plans for exactly what they would do.  Each phase blew by like a tornado with everyone slapping down cards and throwing resources around at such speed and solidarity that I realized I could have snuck away from the table and neither the outcome of the game nor the players would have even notice my departure. It is group solitaire.

Great game. Fast game play and can be fairly challenging. I barely get a game past the 40 minute mark.

Only downside for me is that it feels sad when it's over. You build your little empire pretty fast and just when you are happy with it, the game is over and you start counting your Points.

Guess that's a sign of a good game!!

Initial Impressions: This card game is all about building your tableau. Deciding to use the cards as resources or assets makes for tough decisions. The iconography can be a bit daunting for a first-timer but after playing a few hands the rules congealed really nicely for me. I can tell that familiarity with the cards will result in a more deep game.

Edit - I did grow tired of it, eventually.  Still like it as a two player, but rarely hits the table.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A very good combination of quick play and decision-making. Each hand presents a number of choices as you attempt to fit them into your selected strategy. Roll for the Galaxy is more accessible, but Race feels more strategic. The base game of RftG provides a highly solitaire experience, with one exception. If you smartly select actions to leech off your opponent's actions, you can increase your action efficiency. There's probably an optimal mix of expansions that would make this game better for me, but I doubt I'll find out what it is.

*** Edit, July 2017: The more I play Race, the more I'd rather play Roll. 

*** Edit, Sept 2017: The different dice pool produced in each game of Roll is the key to why I prefer Roll over Race. In Roll, each play feels somewhat different since I collect a different set of dice in addition to the different tableau. In Race, I feel like I'm making the same decisions each game for only a marginally different tableau. The app will get played on planes as a quick time waster, but that's about the only role Race will have moving forward.

Race for the Galaxy is superior to San Juan in every way. However, it still feels like whoever draws the best card combinations will have a more enjoyable gaming experience.  Another negative is that RftG is mostly multi-player solitaire, especially if you are not using the goals from the expansions.  Keep in mind that I am not a cardplayer.  


[b]Gathering Storm and/or Rebel vs. Imperium [/b]
The goals add some much needed player interaction.  I have no interest in playing RftG without the goals.  However, I still consider RftG to be nothing more than filler.  Keep in mind that I am not a filler enthusiast.

12/03/07 - One play.  This game was very good.  The comparisons to San Juan are right on, you can even see some of the same buildings being used in both games.

I assume that as I become comfortable with the cards I will up my rating on this.

San Juan in space! San Juan is a good game but not a favorite, this one I enjoy more purely because of the theme. It feels like a race to pick one strategy and proceed as efficiently as possible, attempting to predict and use to your advantage other player's choices, before the game ends.

Update: Personally I feel this is a better game than San Juan and with slightly less luck involved, as there are more ways of winning here while San Juan you must obtain a 6 cost building or two.

2d Update: Ok, this is much better than SJ! It requires significant skill to play well, and strategic flexibility. If you do not watch what your opponent is doing you will lose.

Just recently learned how to play this game.  First time around was very confusing, being unfamiliar with all the symbols and really having no strategies.  Three of us learned it new together.  It probably would have been better to have an experienced player teach it to us.  We muddled through, however, and soon learned that it was important to build up somekind of military to have any kind of success.  Played again the following day.  Things went so much more smoothly.  I can see that once the cards are learned and how they best work together, the game would become so much tighter and enjoyable.  Have yet to decide if I'm going to add it to my want list.  Update: Received my own copy in trade at GameStorm13 for a copy of Acquire.

The lid is dished and the bottom has one edge split and then taped up from the inside...not museum worthy. However, the 109 games cards and 28 player cards are in pristine condition and don't look handled. Unfortunately, 2 of the 8 duplicate cards for experienced 2-player games are missing and there are only 25 of 28 victory point chips, all three of the one-point variety. The summary cards are in fine condition.

Similar to Puerto Rico but with an added element of randomness via cards.  I enjoy it a lot, it has a lot of potential, but honestly I haven't played it enough to really fall in love with it like others seem to have done here on BGG.

RATING: 9
This game really hits a sweet spot.  Lots of cool ways to go for the win and all of them dictated by the cards drawn.  Quick and satisfying with two or three, I usually play this best two out of three (though we almost always play the third game no matter what).  

I really don't like the game with four or more.  I only have have the first expansion which is quite nice.  I might someday buy the second but I don't think I would ever buy the third...way too much going on there.

appreciate the game and value all the interesting decisions that come with it but it took a while for this to feel like fun.  Initially I much preferred San Juan.  Also dont like how it takes a good few games to make sense of the icons, get a feel for the game etc.  Where this game comes into its own for me is online play or against AI - lots of interesting decisions in a small time frame.  Like the look of the Xeno expansion which I have which gives straight forward strategies newbies can go for and more experienced players can have some fun with.

[i]Posted: 10/23/12, Rated: 8[/i]

[i]Race for the Galaxy[/i] shares the same progenitor in [i][thing=3076][/thing][/i] as [i][thing=8217][/thing][/i].  The two are often discussed in the same breath, which is sometimes accompanied by a mention of [i][thing=19857][/thing][/i].  All of them are great games, and they do feel similar.

[i]RFTG[/i] is the only one with the futuristic theme.  Its art quality and point limitation (a feature from [i][thing=3076][/thing][/i] that is missing from [i][thing=8217][/thing][/i]) set it apart from the other two titles.  It has a rich iconography to describe card abilities, which translates to a learning curve.  If you're not playing this game with any real frequency, then you will have to re-familiarize yourself with these symbols.  This information also serves as a learning barrier to new players; -1 point.

Each turn, players choose the role that they want to play.  [i]RFTG[/i] differentiates itself in this phase as well.  In Puerto Rico, only one player can choose a role placard and utilize its special benefit each round.  In [i]RFTG[/i], players may end up choosing the same role.  This key point means that you are not saddles with a "least worst" decision if the role you really wanted had already been taken.

[i]Race for the Galaxy[/i] thus contains many of the similar mechanics, but ends up feeling like its own game.  I do appreciate the theme, but I believe the streamlined, more approachable nature of [i][thing=8217][/thing][/i] gives that title the edge.

Update: Down to a 9; I burnt out on the base game and wasn't really feeling the expansions.

This is as close to a perfect game as I've experienced:

1) Depth to length ratio is amazing!
2) Scales perfectly from 2-5 players (w/ Storm)
3) Can play 2-3 games of this in the time it takes to play 1 game of most other Euros
4) Several paths to victory, all of them viable
5) Very high replayability 

150+ plays and counting!

Whoooo. Yep, that learning curve thing.  It took me three tries at 3-4 player solo plays to finally get the hang of how to think about this game, and the downloaded player aids helped a lot. I finally managed to get this onto the game table with a 4-player group, and 1 of the other 3 appears to have gotten the basic principles, with a lot of blank stares and lost looks from the other two. But it was worth it - having to walk through a full game really cemented my understanding of what's going on with this game. Now, gotta get this out a few more times so the addiction can take hold. I'm especially trying to use this as a wedge with the Dominion crowd to give them some variety.

Yet another card game where the luck either falls in your lap or it doesn't. My cards allowed me to settle military cards each round and a special card gave me a generous bonus for rebel bases at game end. I saw no applied skill in my options and after playing like a one trick pony, won by one point.

A soulless experience that just confirms that the majority of players who rave about games such as this really can't differentiate between luck and skill. I can extract no enjoyment from games with card engines that dictate the success of a player beyond their decisions.

I thought I'd dislike this game and I was only proved wrong in terms of the magnitude of how much I hated it.

Really good simultaneous action selection and tableau building game. This really is the best example of "Puerto Rico: The Card Game." San Juan is a fine game as well, but this one has more complexity. Theme is interesting to me and so is the story your tableau tells at the end of the game.

RFTG is a breath of fresh air for me. I was getting a little soured on Dominion, San Juan really wasn't hitting the spot with my GF, but RFTG is. Wow, is it ever!!!!! I LOVE this game! The icons were absolutely no problem for me to understand or to explain to new players. There are so many different strategies that it can make your head spin, but that's the kind of game I really like. I wouldn't call this a filler, but it is a good medium level card game that shouldn't be ignored by anyone who's a sci-fi fan.

Enjoyable variation on the Puerto Rico role-selection mechanism - making it simultaneous makes it a little less interactive - and good game behind the complex iconography.

Added 1/6/09: Actually, I think I prefer the simultaneous role selection, especially in the advanced 2-player version and take back my initial estimation of it as decreasing player interaction. I've certainly been playing this a lot lately and have no qualms about changing the rating from 8 to 9.

2/10/09: This has become our default two-player game:- just look at the number of plays. So much so, it becomes hard to adjust to choosing only one role in a three- or four-player game.

Quick and easy to play, if you know how

Cons
Find the luck factor irritating with cards that you know are there but are hidden deep in the deck yet to come out
It also seems to be very confusing for many of my friends and I don't understand why
The theme is too colonial and militaristic for my partner to enjoy
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a great game. If I owned ten games, this would be one of them. While not overly complex, it is difficult to teach because of the wide usage of symbols on the cards. This is eventually a strength in subsequent playthroughs, it can be a steep learning curve. Gameplay is similar to the card playing mechanic of Glass Road, which is a favorite game of mine. Highly recommended. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
I found this one difficult to learn as a newbie.  However, once I figured it out it has proved to be a fun game and I am now better equipped to teach it (mainly the iconography) to others.

Peli ei ole vähäisestä pelimäärästä johtuen imaissut mukaansa, ja harvakseltaan pelattuna pelin "perusteetkin" ovat hieman hukassa.

[b]Luck:[/b] While the luck of the draw definitely exists a good player can usually shift their strategy to adapt. Even so a series of bad draws can cost any player the game.

[b]Strategy/Tactics:[/b] Without some kind of strategy you will usually loose the game. As an engine building game strategy and knowing when to shift strategies is crucial to the game. Furthermore to be a good player it is also crucial to learn to read your opponents plays and use their decisions during the game to best benefit you.

[b]Weight:[/b] RftG can be played quickly but has many meaningful decisions which can swing the game either for or against your favour.

[b]Fun:[/b] An engine building game with a lot of flavour and a little bit of chaos. Great fun for anyone who enjoys long term strategy mixed with some luck of the draw.

[b]Conclusion:[/b] So far everyone i have taught this too has loved it. It's a meaty game which can double as a great filler. It also scales well with any number of players. Recommended for anyone who loves card games.

RATING: 5
The game shares some similarities with Glory to Rome (Using cards for different purposes, sharing a deck from where all the players draw from, role-selection...) the feel is very different. For example, while both games feature role selection, each one does it in its own way. Another example is the buildings in GtR VS the planets & developments in RftG, all three are different and unique.

Once you get past the stage where the symbols make no sense (1-2 plays) they are actually very informative and I like them much better than text.

About what I've read of this game being multiplayer solitary... yes, to an extent. Any game that features action selection where everyone gets to do every action, has an intrinsic amount of interaction in that you must read your opponents in order to use their actions to your advantage. You can play without paying attention to their needs, sure, but your winning chances will diminish greatly.

Haven't really played since I got Seasons and I'm not missing it, so the rating is slowly going down

Absolutely marvelous. The game is very deep with a lot of difficult choices to make at all times. A little bit of multiplayer solitare, you really don't interact with your fellow players at all, but that gives each player the ability to simply focus on their own game plan, and it's nice to have a game that people can't rampage through your empire simply because you 'have the most points'.

Finally played it a couple nights ago.  The first game took 2 hours.  It was a bit difficult to learn but really fun and when we finished the game we were excited to play it again.  We've played 5 times at this point and each game is different and requires new strategies. We almost never reference the rules to figure out the symbols anymore.  It is so much fun now.  The first 4 games, each of us got either all the way to the 12 card limit or within 1 or 2 cards of it before wiping out the VP tokens.  In the last game I won with 4 cards in my tableau just by doing produce/consume/produce/consume...  It was a revelation.  Received the expansions a bit ago and played our first game with them.  My wife wiped the floor with me.  This game is really magnificent.

The cool sci-fi theme and beautifully illustrated cards drew me into this one, but, as I kept playing, the multiple paths to victory and the potential for building wicked card combos got me totally hooked. I find the theme reveals itself subtly but satisfyingly as you lay out your tableau, and that there is a deceptive amount of player interaction to be had (you MUST pay attention to what actions your opponents are playing). Unfortunately the iconography makes it tough for newbies, but if people are willing to commit to a couple of games most will get the hang of it.

Relatively quick yet engaging game. The subtle player interaction through the role selection process is very satisfying. Game can seem a lot harder at first than it actually is because of the expansive pictogram system used on the cards.

Confusing as f*ck all at first, but then settles down. [-]So far enjoying this. But I'm predicting my rating will go down. I'm not sure that a more complex game than San Juan necessarily makes for a better game. The comparisons will be unavoidable. Having played 3 times now and lost, I've really got some ideas on some certain strategies I'd like to pursue.[/-]
So now I'm approaching my fortieth play, which to those who play Race is still in noob territory, and I feel that this game is really opening up to me. I'm also getting VERY comfortable with it, a luxury with me for any game in these days when so many games are here today gone tomorrow.

I'm not pulling Race out as a main course for game night, because that doesn't seem to be its niche for me. Instead, I'm really enjoying the primetime burning of my brain on OTHER new games first, and then pulling out Race for a couple games to cap off the night. This to me seems like the natural place for this game, and its really working for me in this way. I think my 9 rating reflects this status that I accord to it, because in that spot there really isn't much else I would rather play right now!

After learning the symbols, this game played very fluidly, and we were pleasantly surprised! It's difficult to teach, but is a fun, strategy card game. It's like a mix of 7 Wonders (cards with symbols and little text) and Puerto Rico (civilization building and phase selection). The short play time is also a plus. We can crank out two games in an hour once we know what we're doing! It scratches the itch of Puerto Rico without all the setup and in half the time.

I see the reasons that some people go absolutely gaga over this game.  There are certainly some strong card combos that can be created if you know how to work them.  I, unfortunately, doubt I'll be able to spend the kind of time playing the game that would be required to figure it all out.  The confusing iconography will be too much of a barrier to entry for some of my family.  I'll play occasionally with other gamers, but doubtfully beyond that.

Played this before Roll to prepare for it. So glad I did as it is a very different game. The tension brought on by managing your hand as both resource and payment is amazing! Not to mention the more intimidating role 'Military' plays in this game, as you watch your opponent just plopping cards down for free on their way to completing their Tableau. This helps me appreciate the difference in love for Agricola & Caverna.

I was a bit disappointed in this. Don't get me wrong, I liked it and would probably never turn down a game of this. It just didn't grab me quite like I had hoped it would. I think I would appreciate it more with more plays, but it's probably gonna be hard to find people to play it with, who wouldn't rather play something else. I think for this to shine it probably needs to be played regularly and I don't see that happening for me, unless one of my kids takes a liking to it when they're older.

Not hard to see where they got their inspiration for this.  You would think that setting Puerto Rico in space would make a good thing even better, but not so.  The random nature of the cards detracts from the game - sometimes you are just dealt "the win" or "the loss", and that's all she wrote.  Happened more than I would have liked.  Granted, it was still enjoyable, but strictly inferior to the game it rips off.  Rules are a barrier for casual players.

This is a really well designed game.  Unfortunately, I feel no theme what-so-ever when I play it.  That doesn't ruin the game for me, it just doesn't help it either.  One problem I have is that I am a middlish-level player.  So, when I play against people who haven't played, I almost always win by a lot and when I play against people who've played a lot, I almost always get killed.  Not enough close games... but I'm looking to play it more.  Thank you secret santa 2008!

My new favourite game, it really does have it all. Loaded with strategy, every decision is both tough and meaningful and the race nature of the game ensures that there's no faffing about. The indirect interactivity allows a sense of fullfillment even in defeat while rewarding those who take care not to ingore their opponents actions. The theme comes through unobtrusively through the wonderful artwork and appropriate card effects. All this in a game that's over in 20 minutes - the quickest to heaviest game I've played. The lack of direct conflict may worry some people perhaps.

Conditional rating after 8 plays -- I believe it will take at least 30 plays before I know for sure. Happily, those 30 plays will be enjoyable. I am a huge fan of San Juan, and this game is similar enough to warrant a nod. They are *not* the same game, though. SJ is quicker, and probably easier to learn, while Race is a tad longer to play and with it's larger card pool has a much deeper learning curve (both are easy to learn how to play, SJ will likely be somewhat easier to learn how to play well).Components are nice, though for me the VP chips are perfectly extraneous (I always use poker chips for, well, everything). Some have complained that the black card backs become scuffed at the edges, so I'll be sleeving my cards before their first play.Like SJ, Race is elegantly interactive. It's a card game so there's luck, but also like SJ, the skill comes in minimizing the effects of luck over time. The game is short enough to play several times in an evening, and eventual, the skillful players will start winning more.Race is an 8 now. Might go to 9. 10 only if it turns out to be significantly deeper than SJ (which might not be possible)

The first time I played this game I hated it. I thought that the game was a confusing dumpster fire. I had no interest in learning the nuances of it because there didn't appear to be much game there, mainly just memorizing what cards were good and pitching the crappy ones... man, I hate being wrong.

This is actually a pretty simple but fun, tableau building game, filled to the teeth with iconography to confuse you into thinking the game is difficult. It's player aids are the size of place mats as if the game was trying to intimidate you with daunting size alone.

Each turn you choose one(two in a two player game) of seven actions. Based on the actions chosen you then draw/play/trade for that round, then go back and select more action cards. Rinse and repeat until either all the VP pool is gone, or one player has put 12+ cards into their tableau. Most VPs win.

The more you play, the more you realize how the cards work together to score victory points. One time you can develop an entire alien galaxy, scoring points on yellow card after yellow card. The next you delve into military, colonizing your galaxy through military strength and oppression. But the real skill to the game comes in when you have to change gears. Perhaps you were planning on making an galaxy based on trade, when suddenly you grab a card that could possibly turn your galaxy into a vp production machine, cranking out goods to be churned straight to VPs. Do you make the switch, or stay on course? Yes, luck in drawing good cards is involved, but knowing what you are doing can mitigate some of it. (I should note, I removed the card that scores 1VP per development from my game. Every play we had, whoever had that card won 95% of the time. It didn't matter what you were building to, you switched to that and cruised to victory. Since removing it, the games have become quite balanced.)

My first play of this game was with four players and this game simply does not shine with four players. I'll reluctantly play three players, but it just feels kinda average. At two players, this game is juggernaut of awesome. Having two actions really makes you think about what the other person is going to play, and what you can mooch off of them. With only one other tableau to look at, you can figure that out in a quicker amount of time. It's also less players to wait on for decisions to be made and really an all around quicker game. It's quite fun to burn through a night with the base game having each person play each start world once.

Bottom-line: Excellent two player game that pretends to play more players.

I've played this five or six times now. A great little game although I have to admit I played it wrong up until recently. Not with the wrong rules but with the wrong objective in mind. The theme made me want to focus on building a grand space empire, so I would carefully develop my board with powerful setup cards to have the best "engine" for expansion. However, about the time I had all this in place the game would end! There is a reason it is called *Race* for the Galaxy. Now that I have changed my thinking and view it as more of a light/fast game instead of a 4X game I find I play much better.

I'd be interested to try the expansions at some point.

Very good filler tableau-building game.  More variety in cards available leads to more available strategies than, say, San Juan, but also greater variance in the "smoothness" of draws, which can lead to some runaway situations.  Luckily, a fast playtime reduces the pain of runaways.

Played it three times, and am slowly getting into the game. It is really good, but I am still not used to all the icons and rules and expect the rating to improve once I get over those difficulties. Not a beginners game, no way, and I would recommend people to start with San Juan that uses some of the same principles but is much easier to get into.

Update 080622: Instead of raising y rating, I am lowering to 7. We have now played the game six times and are still having problems remembering the icons. For such a short game there are too many details to remember and understand. We much prefer San Juan.

Race to the Galaxy is a fast and addicting card game: sadly though it is quite difficult to understand and, even after several plays, most of the symbols on the cards still are a challenge to work out. This way, one doesn’t even mind the beautiful drawings and the themed names on the cards themselves but turns his whole attention just to the gains each card assures, thus overlooking and forgetting its nice science-fiction setting details.
Race for the Galaxy would greatly benefit a new edition with simpler and clearer symbols. (October 2011)

[b]Update[/b] - After including all the expansions in my games I found Race for the Galaxy has grown into an unmanageable behemoth that doesn’t deserve an 8: not only can’t I see any need for expansions, as the original game on its own is more than enough, but I also think the original game plays much better without them, as they add too many useless layers of difficulty that take away all the fun.

This is especially true for The Brink of War, as it’s way too fiddly and makes the game way too complex.

Solid derivation of the San Juan mechanic of building cards by paying with other cards from your hand. Huge number of possible combos make it feel like Magic in some ways too. To play well I suspect you need to invest a fair amount in deck knowledge and in my early plays there is so much going on in your own area that you hardly have the head-space to look at what others are doing. Still I have no doubt that there is a lot of scope for skill and even played at a casual level it's great fun.
UPDATE: - Played more games of this than any other game in recent memory. Loads of skill and indirect player interaction, upgraded to 9.0

My rating may look a bit harsh but this is only for the two-player game.  I have yet to try it with more but I want to, and expect it will be better.

I didn't have as much difficulty with the iconography as I expected from reading about it in advance.  The game was taught to me very well and by the end of the first game I didn't have any problems.

There's a tonne of comments about how the game is super-balanced and there are many different equally-viable strategies.  I'm not sure I want a [i]strategic[/i] card game that is so short.  In this game, it means everyone selects an apparently equally-viable strategy at the beginning, then the winner is the player who successfully draws the cards that fit the strategy he already began.

The game can end abruptly, and in a rout. Seems many people here don't mind that ("Just play again!") but that leaves a sour taste in my mouth (whether as winner or loser). I want a more consistently-excellent experience, and San Juan offers this.

This game is neat, but San Juan is a better-developed game in my opinion.

I'm not a scifi fan whatsoever and usually avoid games with that theme.  But, because of all the buzz and the opportunity, I wanted to try it and finally did.

For awhile I thought Dominion had ousted this game as my group had somewhat retired RftG.  With Dominion's moon waning, we pulled this out again.  RftG is a clearly superior game (and also obsoletes San Juan if that wasn't already apparent).

I think the main draw is the variability here.  You have a more diverse set of strategies than Dominion, but you are always constrained by what you actually manage to draw.  Managing your hand is far more interesting than the rote draw and play of Dominion.  Picking a role adds a lot more player interaction than you might expect and I hear the expansions ratchet this up even more.  However, both games do suffer a little from a solitary feeling at times.

Now this also means that there is probably a tadmore luck in RftG than Dominion and things wont always pan out for you, but the game is pretty short and it's a small price to pay for a more replayable game.

This has immediately become a favorite game of my gaming group.  It takes the basic mechanics of San Juan and adds so much more, especially in terms of replayability.  A multitude of strategies are possible, and usually necessary, to get a victory.  Can't wait to get the expansions.

Looks like San Juan can be traded away now...

RATING: 9
This is rated 10 with all expansions included.  It is one of the most brilliant, engrossing games I have played and raises the limits of what is capable in a card game.  Every time I play, I think up a story to go along with my alien race as they explore the galaxy.  My favorite card is the Imperium Planet Buster.  I will almost always choose an economic production strategy over a military one.  My high score is 87 points.

Notes:
-One of the hardest strategies is uplift.  It is very hard to utilize the uplift cards to score any significant points.  Should switch to military alien is last part of game to advance.
-A peace strategy is difficult, needs heavy production.  It is probably worth looking into this for any exploits with a prestige strategy.
-Military is somewhat overpowered when combined with takeovers.

In general I prefer the +1/2hr game length to the -1/2hr length because a game usually needs that much time to have all three of depth, excitement, and replayability. A strategy game lacking in any of those three categories is a bad sign for me. When I first played Race for the Galaxy I saw a ton of both replayability and excitement. I thought meh, decent game but the randomness of the card would get in the way of the depth and strategy. I was wrong. Woops. There is tons of strategy and depth and while the luck of the cards can sometimes get in your way, both the replayability and excitement factors are through the roof making this game top notch stuff. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A game of expanding your galactic empire by spending cards to develop and settle. It has an interesting mechanic of cards acting as both something you want to play and as a resource to spend on playing cards. The other interesting mechanic is that you pick an action to perform, but all players get to do that same action, so there's strategy depending on what other players are doing. 

There are a lot of symbols on cards which can make it initially confusing. 

You can also look at Roll for the Galaxy which is a re-implementation with dice. It's simpler to play and easier to learn and teach. Arguably Race for the Galaxy has more strategy.

This is one of the strongest themed games I've ever played. Tom Lehmann has developed a parametric system for describing science fiction, and used his system to describe the canon of science fiction. Every card is a joy to appreciate and play. The game play is solid as well. Games play quickly with very little downtime, typically 15-30 minutes. The rules are simple and easy to understand, explain, and remember. Nearly all of the exceptions and idiosyncrasies are represented in the cards, so you don't need to keep checking the rules. My opinion of this game has increased over time.

Good fun. The symbology is so good I can play the French language version with no problem. Unfortunately suffers a bit from multi-player solitaire but plays so fast this is not a bother for me. There is an issue that it is hard to verify other player actions as it goes so fast.

RATING: 6.5
This is an interesting game.  Very, very symbol driven.
I've played it about a half dozen times with my wife, and we're still using the player aids to figure out symbols from time to time.
It definitely has promise, but I think it's missing a crucial "screw your neighbour" factor that I look for in card games.  Hopefully new expansions will add this in.

RATING: 6
Sold my copy because I don't enjoy the game enough to buy all the expansions, and I'll feel kinda shafted by not playing th "full" game (as the game seems to be designed to play with all the stuff in it).

Great game. I don't suggest playing it because I think I just don't enjoy cardgames all that much (other than the traditional-style trick-taking/climbing game)

i almost traded this game away. i am going to give it another chance with the expansions taken out. that was how i enjoyed it the most before so i will reserve decision on weather or not to trade it after a few more plays.

I don't own this game but have played it several times now. Much easier than many say here on the Geek. Got the rules, and the iconography, within 10 minutes during the first game. Plays very quickly with lots of strategy. Loving this game right now.
   I've now owned my own copy for several months. Mostly play solo with the expansion but we play 2 player as often as we can. This game finally clicked for me and is very simple to understand now. Every game is so different and so fun. Hard to find a game with this much depth, variability and enjoyment in 30 min. of play. Fantastic game!

RATING: 9
After 40+ plays, I still love it.  Plays like San Juan but with more complexity and depth.  This game is supposed to be very well balanced.  A trusted source tells me that you can win without a 6-cost development card (unlike San Juan where the 6-cost purple buildings are necessary).  ** Caution: the learning curve is moderately steep.  Newbies need patience.**

RATING: 7
My husband wanted to buy this after our first play, while I was ambivalent. It's not a bad game, but very much "San Juan in Space." The main mechanism I don't like about San Juan is repeated here: Cards do multitasking duty (currency, goods, and in-play worlds/technologies), which reduces the importance of what cards to keep/discard and makes it feel less strategic, especially at the beginning. The use of simultaneous action choice is interesting, but means that several people can choose the same action, so there are rounds where everyone explores, or everyone settles (which increases the feeling of multiplayer solitaire, though that's not necessarily a turn-off). After a few more plays, though, it has grown on me. Overall I do like it more than San Juan. I appreciate the "it's not just card-based Puerto Rico" theme more, and the cards and choices definitely feel more varied than San Juan. I won't turn down a play at this point, and I might even suggest it, including as a 2-player game.

Played this game a few times now and its San Juan / PR roots are very evident. It's one of those games that is best learnt by playing a few rounds then starting again for real. Our game sped up considerably as we went along. 

Numerous options to attempt to specialise in and numerous ways to gain VP's. First card based game I have played. However, like most card games, if your card draws are bad, you won't win.

I just can't get used to this, somehow it seems too random. You can have a strategy and that's all good, but then when you never see another card to help you along your path, then you're finished. My rating for this game is dropping with each play!

This game looks great and I play the computer version but I really have no idea how to play. Short fast filler-if you can figure out the icons!

If I'm going to rate a game an 8, generally it has to have a strong theme. While RftG's theme suits the mechanics well enough, it does bleed off from gameplay pretty quickly into the game. That said, the mechanics are fantastic, so good that I have to rate this game as near perfect. Nothing is out of place and there are several different points of tension on which one is focused at once. The play of the game is, dare I say, elegant. There is strategy and there are tactics. It may be multi-player solitaire, but it also is a "race" and role selection can allow you to attempt to freeze out your opponent, forcing them to take two turns what they could have done in one if you hadn't been clever. I'm having lots of fun exploring this game and all its strategies, so much so that I have chosen not to read any of BGG's strategy articles because the discovery process is so much fun. What a well developed, polished system this is.

Update: I cannot rate this anything less than a 9. It's just so deep. I am starting to see how people can play this 100's of times; the game is about exploring space, but it becomes about exploring the game...as my students say, "So meta." Additionally, I taught my wife to play in under thirty minutes and she beat me by the second game (making her a convert). Granted, she knew Puerto Rico, but it was nowhere near as difficult to teach as I had heard. It is now the deepest, most rewarding game she will play with me, so I have to acknowledge what this game offers.

Early rating (after 3 - 4 plays) places this near the top of the heap for me!  I appreciate the game the more familiar I become with it and expect it to feel "fresh" for some time yet.  As a two-player game, this works very well and makes for tense choices throughout.  I haven't yet tried the additional cards   rule tweaks for the more "expert" two-player variant.

What can I say but it's our favorite game and it's brilliant. I love how the game forces you to adapt to what you draw and what's in your hand, and smart playing can pull out a victory, even over the "overpowered" military. Plays pretty fast too which accounts for it being my most-played game. Played with two, three and four - my favorite is the two-player advanced where you each draw two phases.

Even after playing this game a number of times, I'm finding that it just does not resonate with me.  Needing to memorize the deck in order to play well is just not something that I think is fun (no, the task is not difficult, I just don't see it being worth the investment of time and effort).  I think that there may be an interesting game buried somewhere in here, but I think that I just have to admit to myself that I dislike card games in general, even the best-of-breed card games.

RATING: 5
0 plays, still struggling to wrap my mind around the rules:

It's intriguing, but it's a tremendous amount of constant work to keep track of the sum effect of all your cards, and there are a large number of possible choices for most decisions, which can make it seem to take forever.

Given the relative complexity of the rules, the cards and symbols are poorly designed.

RATING: 9.75
A good tactical game. The p/c strategy seems to be somewhat dominant in the base game, but there's still big room for clever plays and how you do it.
Needs a learning game and can then be played quickly and competently.

It takes several plays before the game starts making sense, but even after it makes sense you still feel like you are playing a solitaire game.  Dominion has a solitaire-feel as well, however I actually pay attention to the decks others are building in Dominion and react accordingly.  This, not so much.

I know San Juan is the lighter game, but the role choice in San Juan is more significant in helping or hurting other people directly.  That means San Juan requires you to think more about your opponent's needs. 

Once you get used to the cards there is quite a bit of depth and the more I play the more I want to play.  This game is ultimately better than San Juan and increases in rankings the more I play.

This is quite honestly the best single purchase game I have ever played.  The strategy, while subtle at first glance, is quite deep.  This game is full of tough decisions at every corner, and single misplays can derail a winning plan.

It creates tense, interesting games.

Also, it is the game that to me most scratches the "Magic" itch (for those of us familiar with that CCG).  Although the mechanics are entirely different, the decisions still remind me of Magic limited games.  Do I play this small development to keep up on tempo, or do I save for my (potentially) game-winning bomb?  Is it worth it to blow all my resources on this one card, or do I need to slowroll it and hold back?  Is my opponent going to win the long game, and if so, how can I end this the quickest while still not giving too much ground?

These are all fun situations, and really tough decisions.  That's why this is the best game I have.

RFTG requires a lot of up-front knowledge to play, unlike Mage Knight which requires explanation every few minutes. You just can't play RFTG unless you get it. Once you do get it though, it's pretty easy to strategize after a few plays, which is unfortunate. When I play the game, I'm very aware of the cards in the game and what strategy I should take based on the cards I've played. What makes this interesting is of course, deciding which cards to play and how that changes your game. While this is a great game, it's a game where I feel like I will need to get expansions for it fast.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Quasi-collectible (watch for endless expansions) tableau-building card game similar in some ways to San Juan, but as one reviewer put it "on steroids!" Takes some getting used to and will have a moderate learning curve; but, as a filler, (can play out in less than an hour) for gamers still wanting a little meat in their session, this looks like a perfect choice. Pity that it only plays with four (so far)...

The expansion extends this game to five players which is a good thing but one wonders why it wasn't published that way from the start. Wait, what am I saying (just re-read my first sentence)?
++++++
My problem was that I tried to introduce this potential "filler" as a filler after already having played our main game. As a result, brains were already partly fried before we began. Their eyes quickly glazed over and I've had trouble getting this back on the table ever since. They still laugh whenever they see the boxes. It is a brilliant game and I've regretted my gaffe ever since - but I am still going to try to engage my group with this awesome game!

The expansions have been interesting but somewhat uneven - mind you I'm still working on getting acceptance for the base game...

RATING: 10
I like this one so much more than San Juan, it's early days and the shine might come off but the things I like:1. Action cards - this element adds interaction, do you pick the phase you need or try to work out if your opponent will pick it so you can choose another.2. Multiple '6' cards leading to different paths to victory3. Multiple routes to victory (planets, military, trading, etc)4. Fast play (games typically run 20 minutes tops)What I didn't like was the icons, more text would have been better - and white text would have shown up better on the cards. Icons are fine once you are familar with the game, but it adds a bit to the learning curve, and the references sheets are really daunting to new players *** Updated, playing this more and more - really enjoy it, short play time helps. Yes you can play it multiplayer solo, but you miss an element of the game, looking at your opponents layouts can help to predict what they're going to do, and also there's no point in searching (Explore 5 ) for stuff that your opponents already have in play. Can't wait for the expansions! Want a 2nd copy as mine will wear out.

*** Update, not as impressed with the expansions as I'd hoped, but base game is great

Deeper and more complexer version of San Juan. The deck of cards is bigger and the cards are unique or maximal double. First there is confusion, because of all the icons to learn. Also finding good combos is more difficult, while only the minor cards can combined successfully. The graphic art of the cards are top-notch.

As of September 2011 I'm still really learning the intricacies of this one, but I love it. My wife has struggled with the game as well.  The struggles come not so much with the "how" you do things, but the "why" of what you are doing..at least for her.  I admit, it is a lot to take in at first.  I learned it mostly on Keldon's AI before I bought the game.

I can easily see this being a 10 for me.  Great game with tons of depth.  I will definitely be looking into the expansions once we get more comfortable with the game.

Awesome game - but you have to give it a chance with several plays.  As in more than 10 plays at least.  RftG is a ridiculously deep game once you get past that steeeeep learning curve.  It takes about 5-10 plays to get comfortable with the symbology, then the card and distribution familiarity hits at around 20 plays.

Even after 100+ plays, I found I was learning more strategy and nuances to the game which made this a very rewarding experience.  Have only played the expansions a few times, so I cannot speak to the change in balance.  Most of my plays have been 2P on boardgamearena.  Have played on the Keldon platform as well (great AI!).

This game in 10 years will probably be a classic.  It is like San Juan for space.  

The cards are fun to look at and they are of good quality.  I think that there should be tuck boxes provided with any card game where the cards are central to game play.  

You need to play it 2-3 times to finally flow with the cards.  The intricacies of this game make it complex to truly dominate and develop. The game has phases.  The players opt to initiate various phases which then allow the to settle a planet,develop it, and other things.  They continue to grow point values that multiply on the various additions or when your get multiples of a particular type of planet that you are building or settling.

It is popular so you will most likely get to play it often.

But, after several plays, the game feels more and more like a cluttered, mechanical mess.  With so many cards in hand and tableau, I rarely check to see what other players are doing for fear of not optimizing my own cards.  Thus, I feel caught in a solitaire bubble which pops only when the end game conditions are reached.

RATING: 9
A quick, encapsulated, meaty experience.  A slightly daunting learning curve, but a game that challenges on each subsequent play.  I've played about ten games so far, and I find myself developing new strategies each time.  Also a hit with everyone I've introduced it to.

A lunch break favorite at work!

Oh what could have been.  I love the theme.  I love the art.  The iconography is not a problem.  The underlying game mechanics are not a problem.  Despite all this potential RftG comes up short.  When I first tried it I was engrossed and wanted more.  I thought about it constantly trying to come up with new strategies.  But as the newness wore off, the cards became familiar and the game's shortcomings became obvious.  My opinion of the game soured to the point of resentment.

After 30+ plays I've concluded that RftG is just a filler.  The complete lack of direct player interaction makes the game soulless.  It feels like you're in a solo race vs the deck to make a better "empire" than your opponent before someone hits 12 cards.  There are some interesting poker style elements where you might be able to guess which roles your opponents choose and therefore "piggyback" on their moves.  But in the end a small amount of groupthink is a poor substitution for direct interaction.  You can't trade resources.  You can't collude with the other players to reign in a runaway leader.  You can't manipulate market of political forces to better your position.  Hell even if you build your empire to be a military powerhouse you can't attack the other empires.  Very unsatisfying.

I hear that the expansions might increase the level of player interaction.  I hope so.  I was so let down by RftG.   It could have been great.

Boring. Theme could be looked past if it weren't for the awful art on the cards. I don't understand the mechanics well enough to see more than 3 paths to victory, which leads to me doing more-or-less the same strategy every game.

RATING: 10
A remarkable game, able to fit strategy and depth into a very short play time. The variety and replayability of this game is incredible. The icons and graphic design are logical and consistent, and the game comes with player aids to help new players. There is some player interaction due to players sharing actions but some players may be left wanting more direct player influence, this is the only weak point I can think of. My favourite game.

You really have to manage the first 3 or 4 plays. And after that, you can imagine a 1000 options to play, you get in every game RftG. Lay in Military, developments or good consuming your tacticial main focus. High entry level, but sure often-gamers will learn this fast!

Too many symbols on the cards! I'll stick with San Juan (which I already know how to play).
That being said, if somebody else were teaching it, I'd love to try a game of it sometime.

RATING: 8
Cool sci-fi themed card game.  Lots of options and it's fun choosing a direction building your empire into a well oiled machine.  Once you grok the iconography and become familiar with the cards it's an elegant game too.  It is an absolute bear to teach though which makes it difficult to get to the table, and for a quick game that hurts it quite a bit.  Pretty much replaced by Roll for the Galaxy

I have played this game about 500 times now I think. Face to face, Solo, Board Game Arena and Keldon's version and this game is still great. The variety is immense. After 500 games I am still learning new things and finding new combo's. I generally play with expansion 1 and 2 included. No take overs and no goals. The only downside is that this game is a little tricky to teach. I can play this game for hours.

RATING: 8
It has less interaction between players than San Juan. Having every kind of action in a predetermined order makes it so that there's no direct interaction. It feels very much like a race. But interaction isn't everything. In the cold space there's lots of fun exploration to keep you warm.

Not sure what to say abotu Race.  It's one of my favorite games.  It scales excellently from 1 to 5 and with the expansions has a solid amount of depth (I'd rate it as at least a medium-weight and possibly medium-heavy game).  The iconography is difficult to get and knowing what cards may show up is critical so the learning curve is steeper than most games I've played.  However, if you invest the time, this is an excellent civ-building rol-selection card game.

You're supposed to simultaneously track all the special features of all your cards, your opponents' cards, the possible combos, what they are doing, and second guess what they intend to do, all in color coded, tiny, text, and often upside down on the other side of the table.

Three games, still trying to get a handle on this. I was behind most of my last game, until a last minute draw bought me about 9 VPs and the win. So much seems to rely on draw synergy, and it is quite difficult for me to decipher which direction to jump at the beginning of the game. Still no hard rating, but I do want to keep playing, so it's at least a 7.
Update: Moved from 7 to 8.5, since I'm really enjoying this. I don't think I've mastered the game or anything, but I'm getting a feel for when to jump, and which direction. The game dynamic changes (more than I'm used to) with number of players, but the game is still fun with 2, 3 or 4.

RATING: 7.5
I have some interest in playing this one, but it's unlikely that I would purchase it.  From the reviews and forum posts that I have read, the game has a lot of unique cards that lead to possible combinations of plays, which is similar to what I think of in a CCG.  I have enough of this type of game sitting in my collection for long periods without getting played.

Es un juego de cartas de construcción de un imperio galáctico. Me ha recordado mucho al San Juan, pero tiene detalles que le superan, por ejemplo, el hecho de poder ir "recolectando" puntos durante el juego. 

Me ha parecido un juegazo en toda regla. Es de selección de roles. Todos los jugadores escogen rol y lo desvelan al tiempo. Éstos se van ejecutando (por todos) según un orden concreto. El jugador que escogió el rol, además tiene alguna ventaja o bonús.

Además, las cartas que se van "construyendo" van modificando los bonus y el comportamiento de los roles. 

La única pega que le veo es que hay poca interacción con otros jugadores. La interacción es "indirecta"... el jugador tiene que valorar qué roles pueden escoger sus contrincantes.

Un juego muy recomendable.

RATING: 10
An in depth game that plays well with two players in a relatively short period of time. With more players, this can only get more complex and interesting. Repeated plays increase the understand of the game space created by the card deck, and the subspace created by ones current hand, which leads to a multitude of strategies.

Finally played with 4 players and it was a blast. The deck got shuffled a good 3-4 times, increasing the opportunities to get a shot at a particular card, and also increasing the need withhold cards from the discard which might be beneficial to other players.

Everyone I demo the game to enjoys it, and usually wants a second game immediately after the teaching game in order to test out a strategy or home world.

This game seems really complicated at first because it front-loads a lot of information. Personally, I don't really see this as a problem (I train people at work that way sometimes!), and if it is a problem it is offset by the incredibly useful reference cards included with the game.
This is a very deep strategy game focused more on indirect interactions than the direct. If you prefer the kind of game where you "race" for the "galaxy" by blowing up other players, this isn't really the game for you. The idea is to develop your board while trying to figure out your opponent's strategy so you can optimize your own moves by playing off of theirs.
Artwork is pretty good too, and there's a card with a space elephant on it, which makes the game even better.

It took about sixteen games before I understood the first thing about consumption/production cycles. I'm ready to play now.

It feels like your course is set after the first few cards hit your tableau, and the rest of the game is pro forma. This disinclines me from playing more. I'm sure I will though, and I hope this feeling will go away.

Owned it and traded away.  Just not for me.  I read the rules numerous time and checked all related threads on BGG, so I felt comfortable with the rules and the icons when I played.  But it felt as if the game was out of my control, to a certain degree.  The cards I drew dictated to me what I should do and, if I had multiple cards that I wanted to use, I usually had to discard at least one of them to get another one in play.  I think that if I had given the game more time, it may have improved, but for me right now, it just wasn't worth the effort - too many other games to play.  I did consider keeping it and buying the expansion to learn the game well by playing solo, but that would ultimately hurt my chances to play the game with others.  If I was the only one in my group who knew the game, I'd have a clear advantage on others as they struggled to figure out the cards and the strategies.  Like I said, just not worth the effort to me at the moment.  That said, I may pick this up again in a few years once my sons are older to see if they want to give it a try.

Nice theme. Only a slight resemblance to San Juan in that there are actions (roles) chosen by each player, though it plays out differently. Nicely done rules, and there are helpful charts to assist with interpreting the various powers and phases, but it is still confusing for new players to interpret the cards. Artwork not silly like with Battlestations, but quite creative. The necessity of anticipating the selection of each other players' actions will optimize your own play, though it is a fairly solitare type of game. It does look to have a great deal of replayability, though. UPDATE: Raising rating back up again as the game begins to click. UPDATE: One of the most difficult games to introduce to new players, reaching for it less because of that.

Note: 99% of my plays have been 2-player advanced

Race for the Galaxy is a near perfect game. The decision space is huge because you pay for cards with other cards. The icons are a breeze after the first 5-10 plays and end up being so much better than trying to read text on tons of cards because we can easily knock out a game in 20-30 minutes.

The player interaction is fairly low impact but definitely present. I enjoy trying to read someone's board and guess what they'll play next to set myself up for a super turn.

It is a card game so the luck of the draw can end up giving you an extreme advantage or disadvantage but I would say that 95% of the time you have solid options for dealing with what cards you draw. There have only been a few games where one person completely blows out another person just because of blind luck.

After almost 200 plays I still almost never turn down a game!

So, why is this only a 9? After about 20-25 plays I felt like I needed more and added an expansion. Injecting new cards into the game took it to a whole new level for us.

Expansions (in order of purchase):

Alien Artifacts
We've played AA the most (~140 times) and it created a much more exciting deck to play with. With just AA Race felt like a complete game.

Xeno Invasion
We've only played XI around 5 times and it adds a fun group of cards to the game. The military strategy feels very robust in XI which made it incredibly 'big', but I don't see myself only playing with XI. It will probably be more of a "I'm in the mood to do some crazy military stuff today"

The Gathering Storm
Just acquired it, will report back

This is a much more entertaining re-theme of San Juan than I had expected it would be. The symbols and iconography aren't as bewildering as I'd been led to expect, and the combos are simpler to achieve than in SJ; so you can set up a strategy and reasonably expect it to develop roughly as intended.

I initially traded this game away because I did not see enough interaction. However, after multiple plays against the excellent AI application, my initial rating has gone up considerably. In the end, I got myself another copy: this is a great game if you only have 30-60 minutes and there are only two or three of you (although it is hard to resist playing multiple times in the same session). Terrific artwork.

There is definitely an audience for this type of game.

It decidedly has shades of San Juan (multifunction cards) and Puerto Rico (your selected action is what all the other players do as well except with a small additional bonus for the selecting player).

Is this a decent game? Yes. Is it a Top 10 game? No.

Is more complex than San Juan and therefore needs to played a couple of more times before the final judgement.

This is definitely more interesting than San Juan. But that greater interest comes at a price. I'd like to play it more, but I'll probably play San Juan more often over time, unless I can find someone local who really likes this and wants to explore it in depth.

I like this but 5 plays later and I'm still having a LOT of trouble with all those stupid icons.  I also have a tough time watching my opponent's builds to know what he's capable of.  The game play is quite enjoyable and a good "step up" from San Juan, but I still like the simplicity of San Juan more I think.

Really great game, but I can understand the concerns about the iconography.  25+ plays of Jump Drive first really helped understand the ideas and the flow of the game.  Adding in the Production, Consumption, and the role selection wasn't too bad.  

Unfortunately, those extra pieces feel like bonuses and not necessary for the push-pull of using cards as resources AND opportunities.  Still want to try it with the SO, but pretty sure that Jump Drive covers all that we are looking for in this game.  Had we played Race first, we probably wouldn't have liked Jump Drive as much as we do.

Regarding the Starting Planets + Exploration + Role Selection, I am hoping that Eminent Domain scratches  that itch.

Similar to San Juan, but with more depth and strategies. I find the symbols (alien hieroglyphics?) very confusing and it's not very accessible for more casual gamers, but other than that it's great.

A deeper San Juan, with lots of information to keep track of. The interaction comes from choosing a role that most benefits you, or guessing what your opponent's will play and making the most of it.

This is one of those situations when you can genuinely say that your motto is: "say NO to drugs, alcohol and smoking." Why? Because you have Race for the Galaxy! 

This baby can literally become your addiction as the rush and gaming spirit won't let go until the last chip is earned/ card is placed. 

The only big problem I have with this game is that it's difficult to get more people involved in it. (specially if they are not gamers) It takes some time to learn the rules and it takes even more time to start finding "the patterns" and actually get to the level of Race for the Galaxy players.

I recommend this game to anyone who is into at least one of these things:

a) Galaxy-themed games.
b) Medium or hard core difficulties games.
c) Finding patterns and creating chains in games.

After playing Roll for the Galaxy I didn't really have the urge to play Race since I heard that its symbols aren't as accesible as in Roll. A friend of mine talked me into it and I can gladly say, that I like it very much.
I don't need it since I have Roll already but it definitely is a cool game and it's worth owing one of them.

RATING: 4
Enjoyed this game, would like to play it more.  

Update:  I've never been able to replicate my original feeling above.   I think the problem is that every time I try to play the game I need to relearn it from scratch.  The cards aren't intuitive, their symbols aren't standard, and the design is inelegant.

It lacks that intuitiveness that marks a good game. It also has the problem that anyone who has played more than a few times has a MASSIVE advantage over infrequent players.  Have no real desire to play this game again.  Pity, because it looks like there's a good game there.

RATING: 8
A fun, tactical game with multiple paths to victory.
I'm on the fence about the seeming lack of player interaction, but its short play time, coupled with the fact that the in-game goal is to win a race, mitigates this to some extent.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A perfect game and only ONLY not a 10 because of the heavy reliance on symbols. 

Symbols and language are a tough challenge in game creation. You want people from around the world to be able to play your game. It increases the market and lets people who don't know English/German/Japanese/whichever know what's going on. I get it. But there's a line you cross when you are spending the whole game looking at a pamphlet to tell you what your cards mean. 

After a bunch of plays, though, this game shines. 

Amazing. Just so much fun. Plus, you can draft it!

RATING: 3
Nearly multiplayer solitaire, only interaction is guessing your opponents' phase cards, overpriced, oversized. Some people compare it with CCGs. If you really do that you've probably never played some reasonably good CCG. But if you do it nonetheless it comes closest to Star Trek which was so dull and boring that I'd rather eat the cards than play it again.

A great game. Think PR stripped down to the essentials (ooh err) and given a sci-fi theme. Colonise planets, develop new technologies, trade in exotic goods and crush your enemies beneath your military boot. A good deal of luck involved but not so much as to make tactics and strategy irrelevent. Currently one of my favorite quick games.

Finally got the wife to agree to play this game. At the end I just told her it was a two person Puerto Rico. It took a game or so to get comfortable with the card symbols. What I didn't like was the scoring at the end of each game - too easy to miscount something, especially if you have cards that give you bonuses at the end. Perhaps with repeat playing that will get easier. Only problem is that my wife didn't like it too much. Basically she preferred PR and also thought we had better two player games. I think she would give it a 6.

Okay, so yes it is similar to San Juan and shares the same disadvantage to newbies of not knowing al the cards. I like how there are victory point chits in this game as well as buildings so it retains a little more similarity to Puerto Rico.

Never have I seen such good buzz from so many people who's judgement about games I trust. And they were right!  I played this at BGG con, and this game is nothing short of amazing.  The basic setup starts players with certain cards that puts each player on a different course for victory points.  The regular game is truly fun!  And there's definitely a difference between a two, three, and four player game.  Lots of replayability here, and the theme is super cool..........And now, after playing this over and over so many times and having so much fun with it, it's now a 10 for me. The expansion is so cool too!

I didn't buy this for a while because it's basically a card game, and I am prejudiced against games without a board.  I know, I'm an idiot.  The game is damn good, and does seem richer than most other games we own, but somehow, I'm never exactly excited to play, even though it is always a tense experience that moves right along.  Maybe it's the generic sci-fi theme?  Or maybe it's just that I tend to concentrate too much on building big planets and trying to accomplish overarching goals, while my fiance just plugs along quickly and reaches twelve cards when I still have eight or nine.  I can usually win if I play as Spartan Military World or use a heavy production/consumption strategy, but I'd still say I lose more often than not.  Great game, but I don't know as it'll make it to my top ten.

Tons of fun, multiple ways to win.  Great times.  I can't wait for the expansion and I love the subtle interaction of the game between the players.  I'd like to get a few more 2p plays under my belt to make sure this will hold, but this may be an all time favorite of mine.  I haven't spent this much time thinking about a game since Tichu, Magic or El Grande.  That's saying a lot.

I keep upping my rating the more I play.  With experienced players this game is quick and engrossing.  Where the game suffers, I think, is that your first few plays aren't all that exciting because you do not know the deck of cards or the combinations you need to jump start your VP engine.  Once you've played it a few times you see the different paths to victory and can adapt your strategy based on what others are trying to do.  Like Puerto Rico, an important element to RftG is picking phases that help you more than your opponents.  You want to be "out of phase" with them so that you can develop/settle when they pick it and produce/consume when it is the most benefit to you (for example).  It takes a few plays to get good enough to change your timing to make this happen.  Excellent game.  Much better than San Juan.

After one 2-player game, I'm not going to give this a rating yet. Neither of us really knew what we were doing, and I'm sure we messed some things up. Seems like it could be a pretty cool game after the players get to know the cards. This first play was very slow and confusing though.

EDIT: A couple of more plays tells me I'm ready to rate this game a 7 for now. I can see how dedicating oneself to this game could generate a deeper interest in it, but it's just not likely to hit that level for me. I'll give it some more plays in time, but it really hasn't enticed me like it has others.

6/5/10 - I've been playing aganst the AI program available here on BGG, and it really sparked my interest in the game. I'm keeping my rating at 7 for now, but I think I finally "get it" regarding how to play this game.

2/9/16 - I'm dropping this to a 6 since my interested in playing it has been greatly reduced by Roll for the Galaxy, which appears to be a superior game in almost every way. It's easier to teach, more exciting to play, and has much less iconography.

5/5/17 - The official RftG app was just released and it got me enjoying this game again. Bumping the rating up to 8 for now.

An excellent, fun card game with a great theme. Brilliant mechanic (even if it's not original) of using the cards for multiple things. The game is not easy for new people to pick up, but once you get the hang of it, it's a great game that requires both strategy and tactics.  The game has both an economic engine buildup (play becomes bigger and more interesting as the game progresses) and multiple race aspects (players are racing to end the game and pick up points).  The best part is that a game can be completed in under 30 minutes.  A big winner.

Choose 1 of 7 role cards, spend some of your cards to play others, build an engine. It can last from 20 to 40 minutes and it's chock full of strategy. Too bad the green and brown colors aren't more distinct. I can't wait for the other expansions.

Mostly multiplayer solitaire unless you're playing with experienced players. Too many cards to remember, especially with the expansions mixed in.

RATING: 8
UPDATE:  Still hate playing this with people who have played 40+ times, as I lose by mega-double-digits every time, but my wife has started playing, and she usually beats me by less than 10... much more satisfying.  I like building stuff in this game, and care only a little what the other person is doing.  It may not be a strategy for sucess, but it does make the game fun for me.

Finally have played the game enough to learn the iconography, begin to internalize the rules and start paying attention to cards and combos.  I still suck, but I am having a ton of fun while sucking.  

I have only played the game once without "The Gathering Storm," so my rating here reflects the two played together.  Shortly, my rating here will reflect on the base game plus Storm, plus Rebel vs. Imperium.

I really like RftG, and wish I could play it more often.  I feel that there is so much more to explore and, unlike with San Juan, the size of the deck means games play really differently each time.  I like San Juan, but San Juan doesn't.  

I have put together marginally successful civs, but haven't yet made an efficient VP production engine, or a good military civ, nor have I put down even two "6" developments in the same game. And these are just the obvious things I would like to do.  So much still left to explore...

I am loving this game. Very quick to set up, plays in about 30-40 mins with experienced players, scales well for any number of players. A bit of a learning curve for new players due to the icon system on the cards (which is really helpful once you get the hang of it) and learning the different possible combinations of cards. Feels a little bit solitarish, but that's not really a problem. Eagerly awaiting the expansions.

RATING: 10
Now I'm playing it by the right rules, I like it a lot more. Its quick playing time is a HUGE plus -- at times, it feels even faster than San Juan, since your engine can really become a sleek and efficient beast. I still prefer San Juan due to its simplicity and familiarity, but the enormous variety of strategies in RFTG is enticing.

UPDATE: Ok, this game is really fun, but my strategy right now is still very rigid and so highly dependent on luck of the card draw. And I keep losing to Keldon's AI.

UPDATE: 8 -> 9. This game is a treasure. Familiarity and experience with the cards is greatly rewarded. Frankly, luck of the draw plays a HUGE role in the game, but -- and this is a significant "but" -- you can contribute SIGNIFICANTLY to your chances of victory by correctly recognizing the right strategy from your hand of cards. Sometimes that strategy won't pan out, even if you shift it accordingly. But there are enough cards with sufficient flexibility to fit into almost any adequately broad plan.

UPDATE: 9 -> 10. RFTG (and its expansions) has become a "perennial" -- a game I will play at any time, with anyone who knows the game well, for any span of free time. I dearly wish more people I know played it, but the online implementations make it easy to find opponents who will inevitably thrash me.

UPDATE: I would give this game a score of 11 if it existed.

RATING: 10
I have to say I loved it on first play - crushing my oponent under the heel of my Galactic Empire was just the icing on the cake.  There is some similarity to San Juan but I prefer this - particularly the much bigger variety of cards and consequent interaction.  I also like classic sci-fi so the artwork and theme work well for me (apart from the green spice planet - what gives there? - something that needs sorted as a priority for the second edition) so I do like that I can get Space Marines or an abandoned alien planet instead of a fountain or a wheelbarrow or whatever.  I have a very strict rule not to buy games which one of my group already has but I do break it very occasionally (Puerto Rico and Durch die Wuste are the only (deliberate) examples I can remember) - I need some more plays to be sure but this might just join that list.  [Update: (1) it has.  (2) Another notch up - I do always want to play it. (3) I'm beginning to wonder if this is a 10 for me - real good fun. (4) & (5) the excellent two player game and the surprisingly tough solo game nudge this up another couple of notches - a 10 for me].

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Great, medium-heavy weight tableau-builder / engine-builder card game.
++ Good replayability from the different card drawn and the many path to victory.
++ Good card graphic design, that is clean and clear.
++ Relatively fast to set-up and fast to play.
++ There is several expansions available for this game (which is useful to refresh the game when we have overplayed it).


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- Really hard to teach or learn as there is so many icons on the cards (though there are logical and mostly well thought out) and the so many little rules here and there (less streamlined than San Juan), so the learning curve for this game is steep (I read the rules, played like 10 games on BGA, then re-read the rules to better understand everything, and then I started to win some games).
-- The space theme, the steep learning curve, the iconography and the fact that I already know how to play this game, all this makes it a no-buy for me as I mainly play wife my wife, and all these things will turn her off.

A very interesting hand management game. You can feel echoes of Puerto Rico as Citadels but mechanics are investigated in a deeper way.
This could be considered by the way THE card game: despite point tokens, there is a clever usage of cards that become planets, developements, resources and money.

Sad notes about the possibility to play in 4 players (terribly orchestrated to 5 and 6 players in 2 separated expansions!), and some teaser of future mechanics such Imperium, Uplift and in a certain way Rebel. The final thought is that the game fully satisfy players in the first 10-15 training games, while it is absolutely necessary to buy expansions in order to fix the unbalance between some totally over-powered strategies and the rest.

UPDATE: Well, it's hard to be too critical of a game for which you have logged 61 plays, all face-to-face. Still, though, I'm a little bit surprised to see the expansion (The Gathering Storm) coming out and that I haven't played the base game in quite some time. It just seems like the play became stereotyped a bit. I think there is a bit too much range with not as many legit strategic paths as you might think, but not quite enough tactical flexibility once you're going down a path. Hopefully the expansions will re-inject some replayability. I love the game, but I'm surprised that I don't have more desire to play it these days.

UPDATE: Well, RftG has become (in just a month or so) my most-played game of 2007. My favorite game of the year. I worry a little bit about long-term replayability and the difficulty of learning the game (you need a couple throw-away games to come up to speed), but I can't deny a game that I've played this much in such a short amount of time, and which has shown such a great diversity of play, the 10 rating.

I almost wonder if the sweet spot for RftG, player-wise, might actually be 5. It's added one more avenue to acquire victory points over San Juan, the whole Consume route, and since a non-trivial chunk of the interaction is in riding on other players' action choices, having 5 players in the game might actually make it a little fairer in terms of distribution of roles and not getting stuck out with nobody to back you up.

Regardless, though, I like the game a lot at 2, 3, or 4, and the expansions can't come out soon enough for me :)
---
UPDATE: The most common complaint I hear about the game is that it has "zero player interaction", which is clearly bogus. Your role selection is obviously influenced by other players' play, as is your choice of developments and strategy. It's not direct, beat-on-your-neighbor style interaction, but it's pretty standard for a euro. Well, OK, the other complaint is that it's too complicated, which is a judgment call and for some will be fair.

I think Tom and RGG have done a very good job with the presentation of the game. All the iconography works and really helps make the game playable and reduce what could have been significant complexity. I wish such attention had been paid to Tom's other recent game, Phoenicia, a game where the graphic design makes the game needlessly difficult.

Take the amazing, elegant, top-10-type San Juan game, and then add some stuff. Add some more stuff. No, no, keep going. A little more. About now  you get to somewhere around Race for the Galaxy. I liked it quite a bit, but no question it lacks the grace and artistry of San Juan, and there is a non-trivial learning curve (whether or not you enjoy this learning process may be a prime determiner of whether you like the game). I think it will find many, many fans, and I expect I will be one of them, but I doubt that it will knock San Juan from its pedestal.

Chris' teaching tip: I think you want to teach this one backwards. Hand out the standard starting cards. Then have the players put them out in front of themselves as if you were in mid-game and these were their current holdings. Then start with the Produce action and work backwards through the sequence of play. I think this yields the most comprehensible flow. RftG can definitely be rather confusing if you haven't played San Juan (or even if you have, actually).

Last thing: comparisons inevitably spring to mind with another like-titled game, Galaxy: The Dark Ages. Just as G:tDA took a brilliant, straightforward game (Titan: The Arena) and then added lots of complexity, so has Race for the Galaxy (with respect to San Juan). But G:tDA went way over the edge (even though I do like it). RftG seems to be successfully skirting it.

An incredibly well designed game. The number of discussions (and lack of consensus) about which cards/start worlds/etc are "best" is a testament to how well balanced it is. If you like direct conflict, not really for you (though there is a fair amount of indirect interaction).

Got my first play of this in and I must say that it was a blast.  Explaining the game to some of my savvier friends was pretty easy, but I think it'd be difficult to explain to less experienced gamers.  But the game play was fast and provided some tough choices and the atmosphere seemed great.  I could actually visualize my space empire as it matured.

I'm glad I passed on San Juan all those years ago.  Can't wait to play again.

Have played it many times since that first time and my rating stands.  It's a great game.  I need card protectors...

RATING: 8
As compared to San Juan, I really like the strategic possibilities in this one as opposed to San Juan.  There seem to be a lot of ways to go about winning this one, and a lot of possible good card combinations.

I really enjoy trying to make a game strategy work based on my start world and opening hand.  Every game you'll find yourself going after something different!

A word of warning, these possibilities come at the price of added game complexity.  All of the special abilities and symbols and are pretty daunting at first, but became more digestible as the game progressed.  If you had a hard time the first time out, don't let it dissuade you!  Overall, a great game once you get over the initial hurdles of understanding everything.

RATING: 8
It's hard to get much better than this in a quick, highly portable, empire building card game.  ONly Problems are the low interaction and the difficulty in teaching that requires explanation of several symbols.  For this reason I'm more likely to get San Juan to the table even though I prefer this game more.  I'm Always willing to play a game of Race and it's a game i believe that I will always feel that way.

RATING: 7.5
I was lucky enough to play the prototype with the designer.  The game has a lot going for it; it's quick, engaging and if you like building it's quite fun.  In my experience, however, it seemed a bit too much like simultaneous games of solitaire -- the player interaction is there, but is modest compared to the non-interactive elements.  Seems like a great filler, but I'm surprised to see so many 10s.  Who knows, maybe I'm the one missing it and I'll change my mind when it comes out and I play a few more games?  

Edit: three more plays and my opinion hasn't really changed.  Basically I'm in the odd state of believing I'm wrong because I trust the judgment of a lot of people who say there's a lot more to it, so I'm going to keep playing and will see.

Edit: about thirty more plays and it looks like I was right that I was wrong.  Moving my rating up from 6 to 7.5 and I suspect it may rise again.

Further edit: I'm so sure I'm wrong that I bought a copy and will be teaching some friends how to play.  :)

RATING: 6
The rating on this game keeps decreasing for me, likely because I'm not very good at it.  Once you get past the symbols, this is a simple engine-building game.  The standard deck actually has pretty poor balance, which is only getting fixed now with the expansions (in the original rare element production worlds are dominant, Alien strategies are non-existent).  The play also feels too random to be meaningful.  

Slowly, the game has become divorced from the theme.  It used to be that I would look at my tableau at the end of a winning game and construct a narrative that explained the development of my empire.  Once my gaming group got better at this game, I've had to sacrifice thematic consistency for mechanical success.  I've begun seeing the cards as merely a means to VP, and the game has accordingly lost my favor.

Still enjoyable for a few games here or there, but I'd much rather play a longer board game at this point where I feel I'm building something meaningful.

This is my initial rating after 1 game, based purely on gameplay and not theme. Gameplay rating might go up on more plays. IMHO this is better and more sophisticated than than the broken San Juan. However, the cards could have been designed more clearly, though...and the theme...IMHO a civilisation theme would be more apt.

I don't get it. There's almost no player interaction here.

You have a set of cards, you try and decipher the icons, you work out the best way to use those cards. Other players do the same. The hint of interplay provided by the 'action' picks does almost nothing to influence your decision making.

Five people sat at a table playing seperate games on their phones would probably be having more fun, and interacting more.

Very good game, played some games. Only minuspoint is the low interaction between players. Looking at the other players cards and guessing what action cards they play is very important(other comments indicated less importance of that) to counteract their goals.

I really wanted to like this game. I got at least 30 plays under my belt before I finally realized that I don't. I like the theme, I like the art, I like exploring, I like building, I like developing. But what I really didn't like is that winning is determined by production of VP points that feel completely disjoint from the rest of the game. Never mind that you built the most massive infrastructure - if you haven't been pumping out VPs little by little every turn - you will loose before you realize the game is over. I guess the mechanics just doesn't work for me, not because they bad, but because they are thematically disjoint.

Nice card game that, once you get past the daunting iconography, is actually quite fun and has lots of expansions to keep the game fresh. Each turn players pick 2 out of 5 actions to do, but you must try to get in your opponents' head because you can piggy back off any action chosen by an opponent. Really clever mechanism! Not crazy about the theme and the iconography may scare off some lighter gamers but it is still a good game worth the quick playtime.

RATING: 6
Nine times out of ten I feel like I'm just building the best possible produce consume engine I can with the cards that I've stumbled into. The other time out of ten I get the cards that force me to go military with an outside chance at winning.

It's not that I don't like building engines, I do, but I seem to prefer a more strategic engine, like in Dominion, than this one, which is more tactical.

I do enjoy trying to predict my opponent's play and leeching off of their decisions, as well, as the blunting effects of tableau bonuses on the other player's choices, but I find that this takes a back seat to first thing I mentioned.

You also need to play fairly regularly or you'll forget all of the iconography. Also, you can forget about trying to teach this game to someone and hoping for a quick fun first play.

San Juan in space! And with an atrocious learning curve thanks to some truly esoteric iconography.

Ughhh. When I can be bothered to re-learn this game because I don't play it that often, I have fun. I can see why people dig it. But I don't play it often enough to remember how to play, so every time I DO play I have to go through that awful learning curve again and it's essentially killed any desire I have to play.

I would take SJ over this any day just because it feels more streamlined.

This is San Juan with more variability of powers and more paths to victory.

The iconography is dense and not obvious.  Once you learn it, it is useful and complete.  It requires an investment of learning which some won't mind but others will not have the patience for.This is a rich multi-player solitaire with no chances for direct screwage.  Interaction comes in the way of riding along with others actions or attempts to not help others.

The race. Really. You play in solitude and in the end count victory points. Like "stingy knight" you collect sixes because they double and triple your scores.

San Juan was one of the first Euros I ever played and it really took hold of me - I like role selection and looking for card combinations that fit into a larger victory point-generating "machine".  Then, Race for the Galaxy came along and I discovered the true ideal of tableau-building games.  First of all, the number of potential interactions between the game cards in Race for the Galaxy is mind-boggling, which ultimately allows for more interesting strategies and paths to victory than those provided by San Juan, where the card combinations are very limited.  Secondly, the simultaneous action selection mechanic in Race for the Galaxy is deeper than the role selection in San Juan because it provides flexibility and encourages one to anticipate the selections of one's opponents in order to accomplish more in each round.  From a design perspective, the iconography is fantastic - it summarizes complex information effectively and saves the cards from multiple lines of text, which also means more space for the beautiful art.  I honestly cannot understand all the whining on the forums about the supposed difficulty of the iconography.  Lastly, I love the space theme; at the end of virtually any game, I can look at my cards and immediately come up with a background story that explains their arrangement.  Overall, a deep tableau-building game without complex rules or fiddly components.  Simply awesome.

San Juan sucks.  This game rocks.  This game feels finished, and I will gladly get rid of San Juan knowing I have this game in my collection.  Too much of San Juan was getting the "good" buildings and rifling through the deck to find cards that did anything for you.  In this game, every card is good.  You have to figure out how to put things together.  I still have so much to learn about the strategy here that I can't imagine it getting stale any time soon.

Better than San Juan. Plays quicker, an infinite variety of options and I think there is more interaction (via piggybacking). Very much it's own game as well. San Juan always felt like Puerto Rico lite (but takes just as long to play), where this stands very much on its own. That said, it's impenetrable to all but serious gamers. Aside from the iconography, the rules are just 'gamey'. In Puerto Rico, it was obvious that a shipping strategy (for eg) required a warehouse and a harbor. That makes intuitive sense. Here you need the card with the red haloed circle that has the -1 symbol in the phase 3 section, especially in combination with ... etc etc. The fast, deep play is worth the hassle for gamers though. 

Update: Lowered to a 4. After 7 or 8 plays, I am bored to tears. I don't want to play anymore but I know I will have to many many many more times.

Ok, my gf LOVES this game and I do too, but right now, after 26 games this month and 16 or so in the last 4 days... I'm a little burnt out... So this game does have a limit... wow I wasn't expecting that... I don't think I'll be burnt out for long though, give me a week and I'll probably be ok to play it again!

Definitely one of the best games there is and the best if you're looking for hand management!

[u]May 2009:[/u] For the firt time since october, RFTG wasn't my most played game of the month. This shows the mong lasting appeal of the game. Moreover, the game was a big hit with all of my friends, newbs, usuals, heavy players, their girlfriends.... I might have presented this one to 15 different people, all liked it.

The game presents tons of different strategies. What I liek about this game is also the great long-term planning there is, which is unusual for a card game and a 30m card game! Of course, you'll be seeing that after maybe 10 plays once you get to know the cards pretty well. Though starting to play this can be hard because of the icons (having played PR helps, and I guess having played San Juan too though I haven't played this one). However, once the 2 or 3 first games are passed (count 45 min each time), you'll get a huge payoff.

Since play 50, I'd say my plays last 15-20 min for 2p. For 3 or 4 it usually lasts 45 min, but we alaways have newbies with us.

Finally, though I prefer the 2p game, the 3, 4 and 5 (with the expansion) versions are great too.

I really like this card game. There's a lot going on in the game and there are endless combo's and strategies. Race has lots of replay value and is a classic for me. There is a steep learning curve, because of the iconography, but once players are aware of gameplay and the icons the game plays well. There's no interaction between players beside the selection of actions, which is kind of a bummer. Still is very competitive with opponents. Players really have to pay attention what others are doing and thinking and adjust. Also a superb 2 player game!

Now I finally understand the hype.

A very well designed game.  There are times where your strategy depends on what others may decide what to do, and so there is a level of uncertainty in the role that one chooses.  And I can understand why some say this is "multiplayer solitaire", and there is some basis for that.  But there is more to the game than just that.

I consider this a step-up from [gameid=8217], both in theme and complexity.  Both games are still really good games, but I think I like this one a little better.

EDIT:  08/05/16 - I have not played this game in probably three years, as it would have never hit the table and thus I traded it away after the only person I played it with moved away.  And I don't know if I even have the compelling interest to ask someone else to play.  I enjoyed it while it lasted, but like your middle-school girlfriend, it didn't have enough staying power.

I don't miss it.

I'll note that I've only played two-player games of Race For the Galaxy, and not very many, at that. It seems pretty cool, although I still don't have a handle on how to play it successfully; I feel like I'm always just making it up as I go along. Still, I like the theme, and the mechanics are cool; I'll have to put some more time into it.

A bit complicated for what it is.  I prefer London, or even San Juan.  There are too many symbols to learn, and I don't see this game as being anything so special as to make me want to learn them.  Race for the Galaxy strikes me as a game that needs to be played a couple dozen times before it really gets good.

I can see why people really like this game, but for me it is just average. For some reason, the space theme does not appeal to me much (which is strange since I am a huge sci-fi space fan). 

I do like playing solo with the robot, and occasionally can convince the wife to play. Perhaps with more plays this will grow on my further (probably only clocked in 10 plays or so).

Its like San Juan - and pretty much plays the same.  This one stands apart because all the cards are different and there are many, many more combinations of cards that you can utilize to build a production engine.  I had a tough time getting used to all the different symbols and powers on the cards and I'm still trying to learn how all the 6pt cards fit into the synergies of strategies.  My biggest complaint about the game is its complexity for such a short game that feels too much like San Jaun.

RATING: 5
Initial rating of a 6 after one play. But admittedly, this needs about 5+ plays for an honest rating. I like it but... I'd rather play Puerto Rico. This is the first game that strikes me as "multi-player solitaire." Puerto Rico doesn't, because I can scan other players and try too deduce their choices and strategies. But in RftG, the sheer diversity in cards makes it hard to concentrate on the other players, so I found myself just trying to maximize my own little world.

I'll play this again if others suggest, but I'm in no rush to do so. This game actually made me miss the direct conflict in Magic the Gathering. 

I suspect this game needs a group that regularly plays it to delve into its subtleties; I'm just not sure I have a group around me to do that, as we've got plenty of other choices.

Update after 2nd play -- I must be doing something right, as I stayed competitive again, but the sheer overwhelming number of choices makes me feel like I'm gasping for air. I played an entire game without even considering what the others were doing. Weird.

Again, I need to play this 5+ times before I truly figure out whether I like this or not, but play #2 was better than play #1.One thing's for sure--Puerto Rico did not prepare me for this. Not at all.

Update: Eh. Dropped it down to a "5." I've played a number of games recently that excite me more than this. If others encourage me, I might keep playing this to "discover its inner beauty," but right now I'm looking in other directions.

Update after 4 plays: Nah. Make it a "6." I don't think there's going to be a major epiphany, but I like it a little more with each play.

Finally got a chance to play this and it is a fun game on building your engine as fast as you can and finding synergies in your tableau that allow you to do crazy combos. I can definitely see how it rewards multiple plays by knowing the cards as you'll get a better idea of what chains together. My strategy didn't work out, but I can already see a few things to try differently next time. I also didn't find the iconography that bad, which did surprise me a bit. The only thing that bugs me about this compared to the dice game is the role cards and planet/development cards having to keep switching them in your hand was a little annoying, but otherwise this is a very solid game that I think will be very rewarding in future plays.

Race for the Galaxy is one of my favorites for a fairly quick game! Collecting plantets or developments of a certain theme or strategy is strangely addicting, and setting up cards that combo well together is fun and fairly challenging. 
The only downside for me is that I have very rarely been able to adequately explain the production and consumption phases to casual gamers. Something about the mechanics of this game, though not overly complex, just seems to completely elude most people.

This game is San Juan minus the player interaction and the more interesting buildings. It is OK but to me that just shows that San Juan is a good game beyond its role selection mechanic. 

UPDATE: After 13 years of playing San Juan, it started feeling stale. Coming back to this I'm realising that it is a superb game. It does differentiate itself, especially when adding The Gathering Storm and Rebel vs. Imperium. My rating could easily go up to a 9.

This is a good game.  Better with two then with three or four.  There's a fair amount of luck of the draw - but it's a fun way to pass time if you're in the mood for some light empire building / exploration.  

The winner seems to always be the player who draws and places the most/best 6 cost developments.

There is a serious learning curve in regards to the icons, but once you're up to speed, it flows well.  The game seems to capture the feel of "your people" with their own advantages well given its short play time.  Sessions always seem to end before I'd like them to, and usually leave me with a "one more time" feeling.

I'm late to the party on this game, but now I understand the buzz around it. This is a great game. Lots of difficult tactical/strategic choices you are having to make all the time.

This one is growing on me, but I still like San Juan better. It is cleaner with somewhat more direct player interaction vs. the parasitic interaction of RftG. Maybe I need to learn the cards better, but I don't really feel like I'm building an engine like I do in SJ.

Update after first two games with the wife: I'm starting to agree more with the detractors who feel like there are just too many cards. It becomes a luck+card knowledge game rather than a strategy game. And learning/teaching is a nightmare. I'll probably just stick with playing with true believers so that it goes quickly.

Update: The more I think about this game, the less I like it. I've been revising a lot of my scores to get a better distribution and this one suffered. 5.

Need to play this one more, but I think I like it. 3rd play, yup, it's a keeper. Not a pick-up-and-play kind of card game. Not so much stategic as it is tactical. 

What you build in your tableau is going to help create a general path, but you must constantly adapt with each new hand. About mid-game your going to want to follow a certain path to victory, and you can influence the outcomes of each round depending on the actions you choose, but it's just as likely that things are not going to pan out, you'll need to recognize the best decision and continue to adapt until the very end. 

This one never gives your brain a rest.

San Juan in space, or San Juan redux.  I like the simultaneous selection of roles instead of the fixed selection as in San Juan.  This adds an element of bluffing and guessing to the game which is fun.  Seems like there is lots of game here, and it isn't always obvious what the repercussions of your role choices are.  I enjoy it, and I'm sure it will get a good number of plays.

Update:  After a period of not playing it, and almost trading it, it has enjoyed many plays.  I like it much more than San Juan, and it works really well for 2-4 (haven't played with more than that).  I particularly like the two player game.  There are certainly those lucky and unlucky hands, but trying to work with what you have is very rewarding.

Not an easy game to pick up at all (prepare for symbol overload in your first few games), but stick with it and you'll find a great game eventually. Beyond the basic mechanics lies a huge amount of depth, from taking advantage of your opponent's tendencies to coming up with ingenious card synergies. If you can get past the initial learning curve and don't mind non-direct interaction (you're limited to leeching off your opponents and 'blunting' them by not playing phases/roles they're strong in, a la Puerto Rico), this is a must have.

:indigo: :( :D :D :) I hated this game at first.

Maybe not "hated," but I rated it a decidedly unenthusiastic 4 or 5 at first. It's worth examining my reasons why, from least to most petty:

1. [b]I didn't feel like there was any tension in the role selection aspect because of its simultaneous nature.[/b] The sequential role selection of San Juan appealed more to me, coming from a Puerto Rico background. I don't know what to say about this, apart from stating that on further reflection I think that there's a surprising amount of tactical planning involved in role selection -- as you gain experience with the game, you stop looking at just your own hand and start to realize that other people's holdings provide you with important clues as to their next move, and compel your moves for defensive/offensive/synergistic reasons.

2. [b]I thought it was multi-player solitaire.[/b] It is, when you're at Level 1. The subtle nature of interaction in this game only starts to dawn on you when you've played it a lot. But it's there. Stop looking at your own hand and tableau and force yourself to think about what your opponents are doing, and the strategic space opens up.

3. [b]I thought it was luck-driven and excessively tactical.[/b] Is there luck? Hells yes. It's a card game, after all. You can draw the perfect engine out of sheer dumb luck. But try rumbling with an experienced opponent and see if it still feels like luck after he wipes the floor with you. The Keldon AI is a helpful, patient, and nasty-tough teacher. Of the super-popular gamer's games that can be played inside an hour, Dominion is a strategic feast that tests your ability to see a plan from the jump, 7 Wonders is a tactics-fest where an initial plan is impossible. Race, by contrast, is Baby Bear's porridge -- not too strategic, not too tactical, just right.

4. [b]I hated the graphic design.[/b] The icons annoyed me to the quick. The cards devote too much space to pictures that don't convey any meaning. Vital clarifications shunted off into the corner in italicized agate type. Grr. It's a learning curve issue -- the icons [i]are[/i] a barrier to entry, and anyone who says differently is selling something. But every card game is improved by knowledge of the deck, and once you get to know it, the icons really do help convey maximal information in minimal space. You just need to be patient. You [i]really[/i] need a patient teacher, which can be  a scarce commodity since one primary appeal of the game to its fans is that you can order Chinese and play a game or two before the delivery guy shows up.

5. [b]I hated the theme.[/b] A bit of Star Wars, a bit of Star Trek, and, hey, why am I falling asleep here? Yes, I'm a cranky bastard, but I'm sick to death of pew-pew lasers in my games. But, well, the game works.

All of this is a long-winded way of saying -- it gets better. It's worth the climb.

Tom Lehmann seems to design amazing games that take 25 hours to learn how to play well. In the case of 2038, I doubt I'll ever invest the time. In the case of Race for the Galaxy, I'm already there for two players and am well on my way with more. Race is an extraordinary game once you get to understand the cards, the phases, and their interactions.

The game is easily a 9 at this point but gets docked at least a full point for being almost unplayable for the first half dozen games, and only tolerable for the next dozen. I would be loath to teach this game, which has all of Puerto Rico's 'drawbacks.' Puerto Rico, though, is exciting from the very first game. Race takes awhile to get there, but it's spectacular once it does.

My best game of 2007:

This game is overwhelming on the first play, with all the vast array of different symbols which are plain confusing, but after that first game, you'll understand it perfectly.

The gameplay is pure economical engine fun, there are a wide array of strategies that pull you in all directions, but don't seem unbalanced, and a huge amount of indirect player interaction which means the game doesn't bog down.  You can play 3 games in 30 minutes (and want to!) and it scales well between 2 to 4 players, playing with a different style for each number.

Update: Pretty much worn through our set already (and we only got it 2 months ago), and I still want to play.  This game is absolutely amazing 2 player.

Large box to hold a small deck of cards and a few cardboard tokens... Art is kinda just okay. Game is fun and deep. Luck definitely is involved, but approach it like a card game and play best of three or five, and it works.

Quite the learning curve...even though I know and play both Puerto Rico and San Juan.  It will take a few games to really come to grips with all this game offers, but it clearly is deeper than it appears and re-playable - many times over.  I like what I see so far and expect this rating to go up.

After a couple more plays the game has gone up one notch to an 8.  The "hieroglyphics" take time to really understand; it feels almost like learning a new language to comprehend the cards.  And then you try to teach it...and you end up explaining it over and over again.  However, that is small potatoes compared to the punch this little box delivers.

It just bumped to a nine as it really is an excellent game and I always want to play it. But it did take awhile for that effect to kick in.  For that reason it will not go to a 10.

Race for the galaxy used to be one of my favorite cardgame. Nice synergy combo between cards, you have to guess what actions your opponents will make and you always have to worry about those military game-ender. It lost the title of favorite cardgame to 7 wonders but it is still a good game to play.

Fast-paced card game where you explore and develop your part of space and need to trade to be able to settle new worlds and so expand your empire.
The player that gets the most valuable planets/developments along with certain scoring cards will win the game.
Nice mechanics and the fact that your cards on hand doubles as both money and the possible planets to settle on or the developments you wish to build makes the game a bit tricky. I love it.

First impression:

Wow. Lots of possibilities. Plays quick. I like this game a lot.

Impression after a few years:

I never am able to get this game to the table. I'm usually playing with new players and the barrier to entry that is the iconography is too steep. San Juan works better in this regard. I think I need to trade this to someone who can get better use out of it.

So far so good.  There seems to be a decent range of possibilites, especially with future expansions.  It got me thinking after playing it.  However despite its depth, this really is a filler for me.  Very low interaction makes it a relaxing game.  A game I can play my wife without messing with her plans and therefor keeping a warm bed at night.

I love this game, if only I could find enough other people to share this love, but the symbol barrier is a bit high on this one, I tried to explain it to my group and I was so energetic and involved in my explanation that it wasn't until after I was done that I looked up and was greeted by a table full of black stares, perhaps next time.

Still play the 2 player game some with my little sister.

As the major contender for role selection games, this is a great choice for this mechanic. As players race to build their station, players try to pick roles that benefit them more than their opponents. In addition, the "cards can be spent or used to play other cards" mechanic is interesting.

RATING: 9.5
Fantastic game that plays very quickly but with a lots of depth, you have a lot of decisions to make as you have limited resources (cards) and limited time to play them.  When to switch the engine from drawing and setting up to gaining victory points is critical.  You can see the 'puerto rico' underneath the game but it plays fast and different.  Also, the weak player problem with Puerto Rico is diminished as his bad plays could help any player and there is no turn order.

I really love this game but find one aspect frustrating.  Although play skill is very important a good player with the right cards can run away with the game.  Even if the other players play very well there isn't much you can do.  At first I though player interaction was low and although it's not a trading game or a war game anticipating the other players moves is extremely important.

Although I wish luck were less important in the game it is very fun and very short, you don't have hours invested in a game decided by lady luck (see Risk).  I'm really looking forward to the expansions!

Another update to these comments, March '08.  Well I'm very surprised by the depth of the game, I'm over 50 plays now and still not bored, which is what I expected to be after 50 plays.  There always seems to be something new to explore.  Many cards that I discarded as trash I'm now using to great effect in the right situations.  This game only gets better with more plays!

6/04/08 Up over 100 plays now.  I'm surprised by the depth of the game more then anything else.  I was sure I would be bored to tears by now.  Plays fast and deep.  Highly recommended.

I have been really enjoying this game a lot. Has an easy flow and several strategic options. The only thing difficult at first is keeping track of all the symbols but once you get used to looking for them and what they mean the cards become very informative. This leads to quick glances that provide everything you need to consider. Very good design.

Looking forward to the expansions.

This is a great game but with so many symbols on the cards there is a learning curve to get going. Once you get over that it makes your second game so much better.  I can play this again and again but it sucks playing with new people because they'll have the learning curve again.

Surprisingly quick for such a deep game. Lots of meaningful decisions. The iconography though makes it hard to teach to new players and that's my only gripe with the game. Otherwise, combined with the expansions, it's a pure 10.

Compared to Roll for the Galaxy, it's much more complex and has a huge amount of replayability but it is less accessible (and doesn't offer the amazing satisfaction of rolling handfuls of beautiful, colourful dice!)

Trading as I've been mostly play online lately so it's been gathering dust.

RATING: 6
So far, this seems like an average game to me...but I can see how it has room to grow. I like that it plays quickly, but I am afraid that the card draw is deciding the outcome. I'm looking forward to trying this out as a 2p-game. 

I'm afraid this may be a little bit TOO much like "just a card game" for me. The game is over, we deal again...and there is nothing memorable about it. Tomorrow, I might not even recall who won or have any idea why. I think I want a little more investment into a game, for it to be considered truly a great. I have a hard time seeing how RftG can accomplish that.

Still, the role-selection is always fun, and the game works well. I'd play any time, and maybe with more playings I'll get hooked. Just not yet.

Update: Eh, more play just had me growing bored with this one sooner. I completely don't get the interest people have here. Its too short and not engaging enough to be a great game.

RATING: 9.5
After a couple plays I am definitely buying into the hype. Lots of strategies seem viable, lots of replayability, and even though the player interaction is subtle it is there and even manages to remind me of poker a bit, which is good!

RATING: 9.5
"Race for the Galaxy's" only flaw may be its steep, steep learning curve. It's unfortunate that this flaw will keep a fair number of people from ever playing it, because once you're over that learning curve mountain, the game you're left with is an absolute brain-burning gem. You don't even need expansion for it to be a blast, and setup and tear-down are a breeze, too.

Who should avoid it? Anyone who detests games that lean heavily on symbology. There really are a headache-inducing number of symbols in the game. If you can handle that, then by all means, give this game a try. You'll be hooked.

RATING: 9
Once upon a time this review mostly referred to San Juan, as this game was also originally developed as Puerto Rico: the Card Game but was split off into its own thing when it was allegedly deemed a bit more complicated than what Ravensburger wanted. FWIW: this game obsoleted San Juan for me.

In general, if you know what PR is like, then you will have some idea of what to expect here. There are 5 phases that each only happen during a given round when players select them. If you actually select the action you get a more powerful version of it, but much of the game hinges on effectively saving actions by leeching off the ones that other people are choosing. The rub is that unlike PR the action selection is simultaneous and blind, so you have to pay some attention to what is going on around you to pull this off.

Now PR is still one of my favorite games, what is the appeal of Race? Simply put, the game is variable as all get out because of the number of different cards in the deck. The 6 developments function much like PR's big buildings, and offer payoffs for all manner of strategies. In the base set, the dominant strategy seems to be big Produce / Consume (much like Craft / Ship in PR) cycles using the 2X VP version of Consume, but it is also possible to craft a winning Military tableau, or some other, more esoteric combinations, mostly based on having specific 6 developments.

What are the downsides? Mostly they relate to the swingy nature of any game based on drawing cards. You might have a great tableau for a given development card, and be able to dig for it aggressively, but it might be buried, it might have been used as a good, or it might be in someone elses' hand. Contrast this with a cleaner game like PR where the big buildings are sitting out and are subject to a much more public race. I prefer the PR implementation in that particular case.

The other downside is the rules and learning the icons. Man, this game just hums once you are familiar with them, but teaching this is a bear and I have always hated having to do it.

That said, this game is fast with experienced players, it has a very quick setup, and it is absolutely fantastic with 2, which I personally prefer with 1 action each round each player. In all honesty, I like it from 2-4, but it is much more work to keep track of what everyone else is doing in the big game. More than 4 tends to bog it down too much. This was one that I was very tepid on originally, but as time has passed I have played it more, and I really am starting to actively love it, especially since my gf likes it, and it is one of the heavier things in our competitive rotation.

Many comments suggest that the iconography on the cards is a barrier to entry on this game. I disagree. It is not that difficult to understand - especially in the base game. I really enjoy the thoughtfulness and planning required to succeed in this game. It takes several games to understand the necessity for planning, but once you do and you begin to think three, four, seven turns out, it is very rewarding to see a sequence of turns turn out well.

RATING: 8
What a great game!  Just don't take it particularly seriously.  I mean, your entire game is randomly drawn from a deck of cards.  You could easily play the best you possibly can and have it not matter at all.  And you can do jack to stop someone else from winning.  But still a lot of fun... particularly good for the very fast play and simultaneous role selection.

Likes: There are so many subtle things going on in this game. It really comes down to how well you can manage the hand of cards you are dealt. There are many strategies to victory, and often you have to anticipate what action other players are going to choose. Also, games are fast-paced as implied by the theme and name.

Love this game.  The tension of deciding what cards to actually play and what to use as currency is fantastic.  It really rewards specializing and sticking to a plan.  By turn 5 you really need to know your end game.  The explore +5 option is under-utilized for finding a card that will let you know what your strategy is.  I have played 4 games so far and have seen a number of different viable strategies.  Have not played with the "expert" 2 player variant yet.  People say it is a great 2 player game but so far I have had the most fun with >2 players.

I've tried so hard to like this... I don't dislike it, and I will probably always say yes to a game, but it just doesn't grab me. I understand how elegant the mechanics are and what a clever design it is, but it just leaves me a bit cold. It's interesting and intriguing, just not... fun.
The card illustrations are quite dull and unevocative and I never find myself appreciating them in the way I do the cards in, say, 7 Wonders. 
The game could be about anything really, which is a shame because I love sci-fi and hoped this would become a favourite. 
Still, in time I could grow to love it and maybe one day I'll understand what other people see in it!

Rating reflects my desire to play the game, not its overall worth on a vertical scale.

A sub-optimal first encounter with an interesting game.
I can see a really good game in there, despite the lack of interaction. I am going to wait to play it again until the expansion comes out.

Update: such a wide range of geekbuddies love this game that I am going to buy it, learn it, and play it six times before I make a final decision.

Another update: I have lost interest. Will probably buy Gosu.

Update 3: I can get this and the expansion for $20 so I guess I'll check it out.

Update 4: I traded that $20 version, because the rules made my brain bleed.  

Update 5: I played this on the longest day of the year.  A fan of the game taught it to me carefully and gave me helpful advice, and even though he crushed me 39 to 18, I could finally see how the game worked and appreciate it somewhat.  If I find a copy cheap I will probably repurchase it.

The cards are way too busy with stupid little symbols that needs a cheat sheet that is like the Rosetta Stone to decipher! I am sure it would become easier to remember them after several plays, but I am not sure I want to invest the time or energy. Once you learn the game I would dread playing it with new players anyway, as I would have to watch them go through the same frustration of learning the damn thing. Also, there is no way in hell I would want to teach this thing to anyone for the same reasons.

I really don't see what all the fuss is over this. There is really nothing new here. San Juan may be not be as "deep", but is fills the niche for the this kind of game perfectly fine. In the end I just think this is just another way over-hyped flavor of the month Euro! BLECH!!!!!

My rating is only from 1 play, but right now I am not all that anxious to try again. I just don't see my score going up with repeated plays.

I don't know how much I like this game yet. It seems too hard to get going then it is over before you fell like you are making any big steps. It alo feels like the starting planets force you to adopt a strategy that suits them, rather than being free to go in different directions. I played poorly in the first game partly because of a misunderstanding of a rule which I had based my whole strategy pon (Trendsetters can't consume all your goods for 2 vps each, just one).
My second game I won narrowly and the fact that I felt like I had not planned well or played well made it feel very hollow.
I can see that it may be a game I will like but it has not made it with me yet. I am definitely willing to give it another go though.

This is growing on me now that I know the general rules and startegy. I'd like to play a few quick games of this with a few fast players wo know it.

Nope it is not really growing on me so much as wavering. I have given it a try a few times. I just would rather be playing too many other games that I enjoy far more. Luck of the draw can play too much of a role in this game.

Pretty good, an interesting take on the path started by San Juan. It has some nice mechanics, and a rich (if perhaps too complicated) iconography. However, it has some serious flaws, too.  The worst one is that the pacing of the game is a bit off - it tends to end just at a point when most players are feeling like they've finally gotten started. Second, it's very luck based, with winning depending more on what cards you happen to draw rather than how you play them (though it's fast enough that this is a bit less of a problem than it might be). Third, it feels like a bit too much has been crammed in - the game probably would benefit from a bit of editing.

Over all, definitely worth playing at least a few times, and it makes a decent warm up game for an evening of play. It really appeals to some people, and if that's you, then enjoy!

Looks awesome!!! Pumps up the gameplay of San Juan with extra Strategy and options.  Love the space theme too. BUT, it's slow and clunky.  2 hands of cards?  Too many icons.  Goodbye!

A good game, with plenty of strategy.  I'm just not sure if it is my preferred type of strategy.  There is a good amount of focus on building combos and not too much player interaction.  I keep thinking the military cards will let me do something offensive to my opponents and then get disappointed when I realized this isn't the case.

Currently in love with this game - got in on boxing day 2010 after thinking about it for a very long time.

RATING: 8
Not for gateway gamers.  One of my favorite games that I play infrequently due to the difficulty of finding opponents willing to learn it.  So many strategies here to use for the win, the difficulty of this game lies in making choices amongst the plethora of icons printed on the cards.  For a short game, it plays very deep.

I was a little late to the party on this one. I played a few times, but the rules were explained so fast I didn't really know what I was doing. Then I started playing with my son, and it started clicking. Nice little game. I'm generally not a fan of sci-fi themes, or I might like it even more. Strategy is still fairly opaque to me, which keeps it interesting for the moment. It seems like the game is over before I'm ready to start my production/consumption engine.

Even watching people ``play'' this ``game'' is physically unsettling. There is virtually no player interaction. The only sign that there are other players involved in this debacle is that occasionally your strategy does not self-dictate when you want to force the end game.

Puerto Rico wasn't great to begin with, but the randomization involved with the cards is awful.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
(Played a single time, 3P, one player experienced + two n00bs.) It appears to be a streamlined version of San Juan (yesyes, RftG is its own game, but still...) in that cards in this economic game—get a little economy up and running and then cash in—serve multiple functions depending on the orientation. What is different is the role selection, which is independent of other players, and of course the game's subject matter. The learning curve is pretty steep as you must learn the iconography; after that I suspect it's a fun ride puzzling out various strategies. In all likelihood, player interaction is low until you become experienced enough in that you don't really need to think about your own hand any longer. (I was reminded of Mah-Jongg at this point.) This may or may not be a good thing, depending on your point of view. However, a clear problem in this regard is that the iconography does not read well upside-down.

I'm not sure how this game would grow on me. The basic mechanisms are not imaginative, and even feel rather dated at times. It is literally a race in optimisation given a random influx of cards. It does, however, play as quick as greased lightning, which probably explains a lot of its large appeal.

Nie lubię klimatu Star Wars, kosmosu i galaktycznych potyczek, jednak ze względu na uwielbienie mojej drugiej połówki do tej serii, nabyłam tę pozycję. Gra bardzo przypadła mi do gustu pomimo, że nie przepadam za tym universum. Trudnością jest załapanie ikonografii, bo kart jest ogromna ilość i wiele z nich ma specjalne warunki korzystania z określonych bonusów. Karty są dobrze wykonane i fajnie oddają klimat. W miarę rozbudowy swojego imperium trzeba nieustannie się pilnować, aby nie zapomnieć o wszystkich swoich bonusach. Wymagająca gra karciana, bardzo regrywalna.

The best board game. Much more fun than [thing=3076]Puerto Rico[/thing] or [thing=8217]San Juan[/thing]. Light, quick and strategic.

Simultaneous turns make for fast gameplay and the apparent solitariness is only superficial - there is deep interaction between players (including some bluffing and double-guessing) and affecting players' choices and strategies. However it takes some time to see, which puts off a lot of players.

I wish more games featured icons instead of text - when you familiarize yourself with them it doesn't take more than a glance to see what is what and who is who...

Acquired August 2008.

This just doesn't excite me like Dominion.  Think its my problem with all the icons and the learning curve.

April 2009 - I want to get back into this one.

November 2009 - Now that I understand the rules/icons better, this is a pretty fun game.  Looking to play more of it.

September 2011 - My kids and I are into this one full steam now.  Such a great game.  The AI trainer for the computer really helped me solidify the rules and get into this one.

RATING: 7
Fun 2-player game, definite similarities to Puerto Rico. I agree with general comments about the iconography; it's difficult to decipher at first but after you learn the system the icons are very specific and descriptive. (It takes some familiarization to realize that there are [i]no[/i] non-essential parts of an icon, even the colors and outlines matter...) This is a gamer's game, difficult for the uninitiated to simply pick up and play.

My only significant complaint is that there is a touch too little player interaction for my tastes, but even so this is a solid game.

This game pushes some important buttons. I like games that play quickly but have a long learning curve. Over the first 30 or so games, you'll have many sudden "Oh, that's how it works" moments, and you'll reach a new level of gameplay. The game also has a 2 player mode that pushes the already good game, to become an excellent game. It's a particularly good game for couples as
1) it excels at 2P
2) it's low confrontation
3) it rewards repeated play with the same person, and benefits from being able to get inside each others heads.
4) between players of equal experience luck plays a defining role, which means there's no hard feelings.

Race is an excellent game that offers a ton of different options and strategies.  There's a bit of luck involved, and sometimes the cards are just against you... but usually, this can be overcome with good strategic play.  I love trying to find different combinations of cards that work well together, as well as figuring out the best timing for selecting roles that will help me more than they help my opponents.  The iconography is a bit difficult to get used to, but I got comfortable with it after a few plays.  There's a lot of strategy and depth here for a game that can be played in 30 minutes.

I really like the speed at which this game plays. There is almost no down time and once you have learnt all the fiddly icons a game can finish in 30 mins. Re-playability is extremely high. Only down side is there is little player interaction, however the first expansion offers blank cards which can easily fix this issue with your own house rules and creativity. I like the main mechanic of choosing and sharing actions which is also found in Puerto Rico. Great game - I recommend it.

The iconography is, of course, a bit too much. The game could have been so much easier to play, learn and teach with proper Text on the cards! 

I am still unsure if it's *really* better than San Juan, mainly because SJ is more streamlined. Race does offer more depth and strategy however.

Problem is that you have to play it quite a bit to really know the cards and the synergies. It took more than ten plays until I started to have confidence in my knowledge of the cards.

And, after about ten more plays I finally could stop looking at the reference sheets and the rulebook. Yes, this is not the easiest game.

I like this game more and more as time goes by. The game is rather simple in game design but offers a lot of possibilities when choosing your tactics depending on your start planet and your cards in hand. 

Update: Downgraded this to a rating of 7. Why? I still like the game a lot but now with some conditions. It is not that good game with to many players since the game then becames slow and also much more chaotic, and not in a good way. In my opinion this game should be a fast played card game and that isn´t usually the case with too many players. The game should take maximum a hour to play and preferably even faster than that. All in all this is a great game with the right number of players and also the right experienced players.

RATING: 7.75
I really like this game a lot. It has a tight complexity that is rather elegant. The two player version of this game is actually my favorite. The reason I don't put this higher is that the iconography can be somewhat confusing for new players. Aside from that making this a hard one to teach, I can play a game of RFTG in about 10-15 minutes on www.boardgamearena.com, and with the easy card cleanup of online gaming its just so much easier to play this one online than in real life for me. That being said, this is a great game if you are into games that require some effort to get over the learning curve. Its not too bad after a few games, but can discourage new players if they aren't willing to make that commitment. 

I only own and have played the base game.

After three plays (with a fair amount of space between sessions) I don't feel as though I have enough experience to make an accurate assessment of this game.

I look forward to exploring the strategy behind this title once the symbols become old hat.  I still feel like there should be more player interation.

Pros:
-Very optimization-oriented
-Good replay value/diversity. With expansions, no 2 games will ever be the same.
-Incredible depth (you will get better even after 50+ games)
-Short preparation time (2-5 mins)
-Short play time (15-30mins)
-Fun with (and especially) only 2 players
-Different game depending on number of players
-After a few games, becomes very familiar and easy to play.

Cons:
-Because of the learning curve, someone playing their first game has almost no chance of winning.
-Symbology is hard to get for the first few games.

I've now played this game more times than I expect I'll [i]ever[/i] play the majority of games in my collection. While my interest in it has faded substantially, I'll leave the rating at a 9 simply because I've played it so much. It has interesting gameplay, fast playtime, and is easily portable (though added expansions make it somewhat larger). Interactivity is very light (appealing to the "dislikes direct conflict" crowd) but very relevant (appealing to the "likes strategizing" crowd). The only major downside I've seen is the initial learning curve, but the game wouldn't have the interest it does without all of the required rules-bits.

No está mal. La pena es que estás muy atado a las cartas de coste 6, son ellas las que deciden tu estrategia la partida y no tu. Y yo prefiero jugar a ser jugado.

All I can say is Wow! This game truly great with so many possibilities, strategy and tactical. The mechanic interaction is so dynamic, make many interesting replayabilities. But the learning curve is pretty steep. After you pass it and everything clicks, you will see a whole new world!!!!

Unfortunately, the expansion is stretched out a little bit too much. Making the game too random for what it's worth.

Hugely overpriced in the UK too at Ã‚Â£20.99 for what is a card game.

After being talked into playing it a few more times by mates, it has started to grow on me more and now I can't stop playing it! Damnit, I'm addicted!!

After not liking at all after the first few plays, I really cannot say no to a game. It needs to be played a few times to understand it in my opinion.

RATING: 8
Though the rules seem to be complex and the cards have tons of these symbols, you just have to go through the first play (or maybe 2), than it becomes fine.
And the feeling when you understand more and more cards and try different combinations... It's really great!
P.S. anyone, who likes strong interactions between players shouldn't play this game. Any other must give it a try!

RATING: 6
I understand why many people like this game, but it is definitely not my cup of tea. Too much focused on myself and lack of interaction (maybe when I will play it for 20 times I will be able to even look at opponent's cards, but I'm affraid I will never play it for so many times)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Components: Thematically evocative artwork on all the cards; quite a joy to look at. The functional information on the borders of the cards is very blah, and is visually distracting. Ideally, a card would not display a phase number on its left side if the card has no possible action during that phase; as is, there is a lot of visual clutter, and once a producing world is covered by a goods card it is difficult to tell what information has been hidden by the good. In general the iconography is effective, though unattractive. The card quality is good, with a nice linen finish that withstands a lot of shuffling. If it weren't for the oversized player's aid, the game could come in a much smaller box.

Experience: The action-selection engine is enjoyable; I especially like being able to perform an action that my opponent has selected; it's like receiving a gift.

Nice, subtle ways in which players interact:
1) Forcing each other to consume prematurely. There's nothing sweeter than turning my own rare good into two cards, while watching my card-starved opponent's alien good converted to a victory point, rather than the handful of cards they were expecting on the following round.
2) Selecting an action which promises to not benefit the opponent (e.g. Develop, when one is sure that the opponent has no development cards). If the opponent ends the round with no cards in their hand, playing Develop and Settle together can exploit their state.
3) Not playing an action card that the opponent is expecting one to play. This enters the uncertain realm of outguessing one's opponent (akin to character selection in Citadels). If I'm card-starved, then of course I'll select Explore, which means my opponent doesn't need to; but if they're counting on me to do it, and I know that, perhaps I can select a different phase, also useful to me, and thus gum up my opponent's plans.
4) Changing one's mind mid-turn to respond to the action cards an opponent has played (e.g. in a recent game I hoped to explore a few development cards that would work well with my current tableau, but when I saw that my opponent had played Settle and Produce, I instead selected a development card with +2 military, which allowed me to conquer a 2 production world during the Settle phase, and that world then immediately produced). 
5) Adapting one's tableau to take advantage of the opponent's strategy (e.g. if the opponent has many production worlds, the opponent will most likely choose Production and Consume, so one's own tableau should have some flexibility to perform during these phases as well).

Our respective production engines quickly differentiate themselves, both from each other, and from previous games, leading to particular strategies. With the variety of cards, and the random limitations of one's starting hand, exploring the same strategy (e.g. emphasizing military power) still leads to different results, and to a tableau with a distinctive character to it. It's fun to discover effective combinations of cards. The more I play, the more I find particular uses for obscure cards that, until that moment, had been only currency to me.

Gets better with every play. There are so many different ways to earn points, and so many effective combinations of cards. This game is amazing.

Currently playing with all cards from first three expansions that don't involve rule changes. Playing with prestige against Keldon's AI (love prestige). Playing with Alien Artifacts without the Orb rules. All awesome.

A very different game with three players from that with two players. More brutal.

After 300 plays, I'm still looking forward to each game. Outstanding every time.

A game I bought originally to kind of be 'peurto rico' in card form (as I am not a big San Juan fan).  By that I mean a game to scratch the same itch, transport well, and play a bit faster.  

This game checks a lot of boxes - good cards, cheap, small.

A little too solitairy for my liking.

RATING: 9.1
One of the best card games ever. Although it's based on Puerto Rico, this game has a much steeper learning curve due to the sheer number of planets, but, once you get the hang of it, it is actually quite elegant. I particularly enjoy the many paths to victory and how the game rewards smart play. I love the theme, but I'm not sure the theme ever actually comes through that strongly. That said, for a card game, the theme is well integrated. The simultaneous, hidden role selection is really what makes the game. The best players try to figure out what roles the other players will select and try to take advantage of those roles while also selecting roles that benefit primarily themselves.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Invest in the iconography and you will be well-rewarded.  This game just flows smoothly (err forgetting that whole alieny orby thingy).  People tend to criticize it for being multi-player solitaire but that's a load of bull; the people that win the game are more likely than not those who read what their opponents are about to do and piggyback accordingly.  I love this game.

Rating after one play, which isn't fair really.  There's a lot to familiarize yourself with, I think of this as San Juan meets Magic, due to the complexity of the cards.  We'll see if rating goes up; I imagine it will.  Great artwork.

This game is awesome.  Easy setup, quick play, and different every time.  I'm not wild about the 3rd expansion.  I prefer to play with the 1st two expansions, without takeovers, and with or without goals.  I also really enjoy the Alien Artifacts expansion, but have not yet tried the "explore the orb" game yet.  It has a very well balanced deck, providing more opportunity for military or development strategies instead of mostly building a VP consume engine every time.

I anticipated this long before it's actual release as I like San Juan and this promised to be a better game with a better theme. I have not been disappointed the simulataneous action selection removes the possibility of being left with nothing useful to pick and the much wider variety of cards and addition of consumption leads to a many different victory routes. Unfortunately as I don't do 2 player, opportunities for play are more limited than I would like

San Juan on Acid meet Settlers of Catan card game. Looks like a compacted strategic production gamewith not much player interaction.

Game where you must be very flexible in adapting your starting plans. Sometimes, if you´re type who set his strategy on the start and never changes it, your rivals give you hell.

 Theme is good, but art isn´t nice at all. Rules are quite simple and still very complex. But they are so not well written, that they discourage many players. One thing is good to know, it needs to be played with gamers "on same skill level" or neither of them have fun.

Clean and precise mechanics; best when playing with the advanced two player rules. It can seem abstract, but the abilities of the cards are themed beautifully and the artwork, names of the cards, and their powers are almost always perfectly matched. 

After several plays, it seems to me a bit stale strategically. If using only the base game, there are only one or two superior paths to take, which, based on the cards you're dealt, is always narrowed down to one optimal path. This takes a bit of the creativity or individuality out of play, and you rarely have to think too hard about what to do, but still a satisfying and enjoyable experience.

Currently my favorite game. I love card games anyway, but this one is special. I like the role selection and the simultaneous play aspects. The art is very cool and I like that there are a number of different approaches and strategies to be employed.

Our absolute favourite game.  The only reason you're not seeing a lot of plays here is because I sort them into their expansions.  I own three copies of the base game, and have them permanently set up for each of the three arcs (Base + TGS, Base + AA, Base + XI).  I haven't really had a lot of experience with the additional modes (Orb, Invasion, hell I haven't even played much with Goals).  2PA is our favourite mode, and I could play it indefinitely.

Everything about this blends together so, so well into an elegant, smooth-flowing game! The usage of cards for currency, for instance, leads to some meaty decisions in which to decide what cards to discard. Some may say this game is 'multiplayer solitaire', but the interaction comes from guessing what phases your opponents are going to pick, and piggybacking off those.

2.9 my ass. Ridiculously complex. Sucks the life out of the game (and me). 5 minutes of trying to figure out the consume rules and what the icons mean and I lost the will to live.
I'll bet when Tom Lehmann orders a pizza, he gets a different combination of ingredients on every slice.

Later...ok I was a little harsh (as usual).
This game does serve a purpose. It's perfect for scratching that gamer itch in a relatively short period of time (once you get your head around it). The vast majority of "filler" games are just too light to be satisfying. I'll give it an 8 with a bit of a chip on my shoulder still...

The perfect card-game. Borrowing the same Puerto Rico character choice (here you pick the action), this is another variation on the multiplayer solitaire. But what a variation. Over 20 different strategies to win, you have to adapt your strategy to the game and the players (keep it fast or go the full-suited expansion? pick the alien route or the military strategy?). Love it. And lucky me, loved by my wife who never refuses a game.

The good:
This is my favorite care game that requires some knowledge of the cards. Even though I often criticize games like Agricola and Twilight Struggle for requiring card-knowledge, I don't think that applies to RFTG.  Why?  Mainly because the iconography is standardized, which makes comparing card strengths easier.  Also, there is no element of "timing" when certain cards "come out."

The bad:
Explaining the rules is like teaching fractions to a 4-year old.  The cards are also low-quality.

One of the better card games.  Still isn't very visually stimulating.  I find it take a while to learn cards well enough to be competitive and I still find it difficult to see what other player have in play.

Also, Tableau is one of the worst words in the world.  I hate when people say it during play.

It's problem is that while a good game, i'd rather play Puerto Rico which is it's bigger brother. It plays with the same foundation, but it has none of the annoying iconography used in this game. Sure you can "get over it" by playing it lots of times so the icons become second nature, but honestly why bother when i have Puerto Rico in my closet begging to be played...

A game with a steep learning curve, but worth the effort to learn it. It all of a sudden just snaps into your cognition. The idea is to assess your hand and then go with a good strategy and drive it. You will get very good cards that do not align with your strategy and you need to get rid of these. Pay attention to others' cards and try to nip their phase cards to your benefit. Fun and quick to play.

Rating after 150 plays: no changes, still loving it!

Rating after 100 plays: still loving it! Race for the Galaxy is fast, interesting and has replayability up the wazoo. I don't think I've ever had such a full gaming experience distilled into the 30-40 minutes it takes to play. This is a game that I recommend for everyone who thinks they can tough out a little learning curve.

If this game had more/better player interaction I would give it a higher rating. As it is its only a little more than multi-player solitaire. My rating of it this high is just because the mechanic and card are nice.

This is a deck building game.  Except there is very little player to player interaction via the cards!  

This game truly is a RACE. Build your empire,and gather points in the process.  The only player to player interaction really occurs in watching what everyone else is doing, and realizing that fewer cards are available of each type that they have chosen.

This is similar to Puerto Rico, except that in PR there is much more competition for shipping the goods and trading the goods.  Thus players have more ability to "shark" one another and affect the outcome of the game.  In this game all you can really do is take cards that could benefit someone else.

And unlike most deck building games noobs will suffer in this game.  Deck knowledge/memorization is not as important in Dominion or Thunderstone.  And it absolutely doesn't matter in Puerto Rico.  But in RftG it is extremely important.  Knowing what is left in the deck affects what card you pick next for your tableau.  Noobs have no idea what cards are left, and thus card knowledge can be the difference between winning and losing.

To be good at Dominion or Thunderstone only requires math skill.  To be good at RftG requires thorough knowledge of the entire deck!  Thus the person who owns this game will probably annihilate all of his/her friends (who do not own it) everytime it is brought out.  Not a very good recipe for repeat play!

Worse yet, this game is heavily dependent on "certain" cards being drawn by the players.  So unlike PR or Dominion, players are rabidly hunting through the deck looking for those very important cards.  Failure to pull just the right card, through luck, can mean the difference between winning and losing, which sucks since that means player skill and conscious choices are thrown out the window.

So in short this game is kind of like Puerto Rico *Lite*, with much less player interaction, and it is much more dependent on deck knowledge and on counting cards than most deck building games.  In addition, the game is balanced in such a way that quite a few cards are "must have" or failure is imminent.  So players are forces to scour the deck for that one card that will give them victory.  That in itself is major game flaw.

While a valiant attempt at creating a rival to PR, this game is seriously dead in the water.  Player choices are seriously hampered by the sheer luck that a "perfect card" will be drawn in an enormous deck, thus luck truly runs this game instead of player choices.  Thus your decisions as a gamer are reduced to almost nothing and you are no longer playing a game, but running through a procedure in which someone will win, with little regard to what they actually do.

Have thoroughly enjoyed it with many numbers of players. Still some debate about the amount of luck with 2 players. I believe it is now more than I would care to admit, but I still have fun playing it out.
The 25 cards of the expansion significantly helps the balance.

With all expansions up to and including The Brink of War I have upgraded game rating to a 10.  A tour de force, no question about it.

After many many plays have dropped to a 9. It is still amazing, excellent, and I will happily play it, but I won't be pushing for it at game sessions anymore.

2-4 players, 30-45 minutes, medium heavy, deck building

I love this game, especially with two players this is a fast deck building race game. No game is the same with different starting planets and so many cards that come along during the game. Most logged games are online (BGA), but this has also become one of the main fillers in our gaming group, especially for two of us, where we usually throw in one of the expansions.

Trying to get my son (10) into playing this one as well :)

It takes a while to get used to the iconography, but it is worth the couple to few plays that it takes to read the cards more easily.  There seems like there is a lot of luck involved, but a clever player can deal with the variability.  There is plenty of replayability, and I have been told that the solo varient plays well also.  It is not for everyone, but something that you should give a few tries before you pass judgement.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
If you can get a group of people who already know the iconography of the cards, you can have a lot of fun with this game.  However, there's a pretty big barrier to entry for new players for what, ultimately, is a relatively simple card game to play.

You never know how you're going to play until the first few cards come your way.  Then you take what you've been given and build on it.  One game you may go military heavy, while in the next you produce and consume like there is no tomorrow.  

Having to form a strategy after your initial hand requires a little bit of a shift-on-the-fly mentality (you really can't go into a game with the intent to go, let's say, military heavy, because you don't know what cards you will be dealt), but that's one of the aspects I most enjoy.

Race for the Galaxy certainly seems like a good game, I'm just not sure I'll ever get to fully experience it.  I think the game likely shines with players that have a full understanding of the rules and possible card combinations.  Once you can focus on others more than yourself and build your plans around what others are doing I think the game would really start to click.

Unfortunately I don't think my group will ever play enough to get to this point.  When it comes to teaching someone a game there are many others for 2-4 players that I'd rather dive into but I would certainly not turn down a game of Race for the Galaxy if it's the game of choice.

RATING: 6.5
(based on playing with Keldon AI)

I didn't feel drawn to this game but decided to try it after finding out it's Touko Tahkokallio's favourite game. At this point I don't understand the praise though.
I won my first game against the Keldon AI without having much of a clue about what I was doing. I'm not used to the lack of player interaction in a game like this. What do I do when my opponent happens to get "galactic trendsetters" up and scoring on his third or fourth turn while I'm still looking for my first production planet? When the cards fall like this, there seems to be literally nothing you can do to catch up. I can appreciate the game design and effective use of icons.

Surely there must be more to this as it is one of the most praised and recommended games in recent history.

UPDATE: After 22 games still hasn't clicked for me.

It wasn't bad, but it didn't have the action I assumed it might have. I'd give it a 5 - 5.5 and I'd play it once or twice again if someone asked and there was nothing else to play. The building aspect and a lot of the colors and rules were hard to understand at first, but playing it taught it a lot quicker. Nearly won.

This is my favourite game of all time. Sure, this game has a fairly steep learning curve. First, you need to understand the iconography; however, once you get the iconography, you can easily understand what each card does within one second of looking at it. The second thing one has to learn is the strategy - too often I see newcomers try both the "Military" and the "Production" strategy at the same time and that rarely works. However, once you overcome the learning curve after about 4-5 games of it, you will find a rich and deep strategic card game in here. Once you know what you're doing you can get a game done in 15-20 minutes (even though the box lists a playtime of 45 minutes). Highly recommended.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
If you've played San Juan (a good game), then this is one with similar mechanics, but with more cards, more mechanics, and a more exciting theme. What's not to like?
The first few plays were frustrating, as I was learning the game and all its iconography. It's not as much fun when you feel rushed by those who choose their roles in two seconds every turn. Much more fun when some thought is put into it, and a few minutes are spent at the end reflecting on your galactic civilization. 

I have to give mention to the excellent artwork on every single card in this game. Very impressed!

I've only played it through the app but it's not hard to imagine what it would be like playing the physical version.

This game is just a pure tableau/engine builder. The learning curve can be steep because of all the iconography but once you understand everything it has very nice depth to it. I've played hundreds of games and I'm still learning things. The mark of a great card game. 

The artwork is hit or miss for me but overall it's pretty clean and very functional if nothing else.

It does feel a little like multi-player solitaire although great players will definitely exploit weaker players by having a better grasp of what their opponents are likely to do allowing them to be more efficient and giving them a nice edge to win.

I truly wish I had a few more friends that would be willing to give this game a try, because I have only ever played this as a 2 player game.  I love it, and my sister really enjoys this as well.  Inspired by the Puerto Rico role selection concept (actually, this is basically an upgraded re-theme of San Juan), this card game is much easier after about the 4th time played - which is part of the problem.  Steep learning curves tend to turn off most in my gaming group, so they don't give a fair chance to the game.  It is likely that a new player will feel overwhelmed (much symbols/icons to learn), and get crushed by the experienced player - and most likely not play again.  Please, be patient with this game!  It's a great game, but takes a few games to get the hang of.

This game is awesome, although before you can properly play it you should be aware of which cards are in the deck. This may potentially frustrate some new players, although my group doesn't seem bothered by it too much!

The game is only slightly competitive, so my group tends to enjoy beating their own personal bests or performing their strategies, rather than being disappointed with a loss.

The cards function very well together. The designer of this game has designed a very excellent game and can rightly be proud of himself!

I really wish these exact game mechanics were applies to a non-space-themed game; it turns too many people off what is otherwise a surprisingly deep, quick, fun game. 

The players we associate with often relate board games with anything but the futuristic, techie world of some video games and so are/were uninterested in this.

One or two plays will change that, but still - a shame it isn't "Race For the Earth" or something. 

Still the theme could equally appeal to video gamers looking to "get away!"

Worth the effort if you're at all interested in card-based strategy games of any theme.

Let me preface this with saying that you have to like this sort of card game in order to like this game.  I think people who like that way the cards are used in similar games will like this better than I did.  But the card balance is still bad.  

The biggest problem with this game is that you can't ever work on one clear strategy.  The cards never line up.  You can't say, "this time i'll try production - points."  Nope.  That isn't ever going to happen.  You can never say what strategy you will work on as you can't get any they put into the game to work.  You are alway reacting to what ever is in your hand.  Most people I play with wanted to be able to work on a given strategy but could never get it to work.  It's like playing D&D and starting out as a wizard.  Then a few turns into the game everything points to being a fighter.  Ok, I'll switch to a fighter.  Nope, I need to be a thief.  Nope....it goes on like that forever.  You always feel like you are walking forwards while being pulled backwards. 

The easiest strategy is military.  With each expansion, everything is military.  Now everyone pretty much uses the military strategy.  I always offer this game up first on game night but no one ever wants to play it.  They all say it's a great game ...buuuuut....

I think it's the most overrated game out there.  There are a few things they could have done to fix this but they went the route of most cards just don't work with most other cards and enough of the cards that do work together never end up in your hand.  

As you can tell - this is the major flaw in the game.  it's not like any of the other strategy games that you can go off to bed and think up new things to try next time - because you can't.  it's will always be to react to whatever ends up in your hand.  In strategy games, I like to at least know my pieces.

Now, thanks to the expansions (I have them all), it's simply a military game where you take a few resources.  I thinks it's one of those games where people claim to like it so they look important.

For me, an 8 after one play.  I like the complex card interactions and think there are a lot more different combinations and ways to play than San Juan.  However, it is very much multiplayer solitaire, in fact you surely could play this as solitaire but then it wouldn't be a race.  Also there is a steep curve as far as the symbols goes, you're constantly looking at the cheat sheet.  If you don't like CCGs and reference sheets or non-interactive games, you won't like it.  Otherwise, it's fun.

RATING: 7.5
My opinion of Race for the Galaxy is mixed. I like the way phases are selected (which certainly provides some interesting decisions, but also sometimes just comes down to guesswork) and I like the different paths and strategies available.

I'm not as enthused about the surprisingly low level of player interaction... no player cards seem to have any direct effect on any other player (other than perhaps ending the game earlier than expected). Beyond that, timing and choosing sensible actions (and outguessing the other players' actions) and being the first to claim some of the scoring tiles seem to be about the only interaction there is.

While I'm certainly interested in playing more, this game isn't the instant classic I was hoping for.

One last note: much has been made of the icons used in this game. They're not really all that complicated. I was expecting much worse, given the hubbub.

Edit: played again, adding the next expansion. There's a small amount of direct interaction possible (via takeovers). Still feels a lot like multiplayer solitaire... but a good multiplayer solitaire, in any case.

Ik speel regelmatig een spel en ik speel zelfs regelmatig een kaartspel, maar dit kaartspel gaat mijn petje te boven. Nadat ik op de spelregels heb zitten zwoegen, heb ik dit spel 2x gespeeld. Ik vond het niet leuk om te spelen (waarschijnlijk is dit een spel dat je veel meer moet spelen om het goed te kunnen waarderen) en ik heb ook geen zin om het nog opnieuw te spelen. Het sprak me gewoon niet aan, ook het thema is niet mijn ding. Race for the galaxy is voor velen een topper, ik kan het (op basis van mijn eigen speelervaringen) helaas geen voldoende geven.

After RftG many other card games used the same way of using cards as currency. (I don't know if RftG was the first) The variant ways to victory keep it fresh, as well as the many expansions.

A steep learning curve to play this game. IMO, at least it needs a couple of games just to grasp the phases, abilities, and its iconography. After few more games knowing how cards are played and its strategies, you get the feel why its called "RACE" for the galaxy. A great game and tons of replayability!!!

Now, if only I could convince my friends to play this game.

RATING: 6
Good card game, cool theme, and short. Essentially [i]San Juan[/i] with a sci-fi theme, and a notch up in complexity and interaction between the cards. I owned it at one point, but at the time it felt too much like multi-player solitaire and I was getting a little bit into [i]Dominion[/i], so I traded it.

Update: decided to get the Steam app, where I can finish a game against the AI in about 10 minutes. So far I'm having fun with it, but will probably stick to a digital copy only where I mostly just play against the AI. As someone else mentioned, since you can play this game a lot in quick succession it doesn't take long to learn some optimal strategies, which could be very unfun for other players in casual games.

RATING: 7.75
Great game. However there are a number of minor things that nibble out a good score for me, which add up.

What I liked:
* Nice depth for primarily a card game.
* Mechanics work well and are simple
* Multiple paths to victory that are fairly well balanced

What I didn't like:
* Too many icons some of which are not straight forward.
* Takes a few games to learn
* An experienced player will always trounce a new player
* Hard to bring to the table
* New players need to play this regularly if they want to become decent.

With an analog to Puerto Rico's shipping phase and almost one hundred different cards ---- many of which have more than one effect ---- compared to San Juan's 30 cards, this game may never grow stale and certainly will not do so nearly as quickly as San Juan did for me. The best RftG players probably are able to spot synergistic combos of cards, an enterprise that I am neither particularly good at nor especially interested in. However, the game is enjoyable even for those of us who do not normally cotton to games with CCGish elements.

Surprisingly good considering that I hate Puerto Rico.  Race feels like it has freedom to it, PR feels rigid and confined.  I like the hand management aspect and the simultaneous role selection.  Shorter too!  UPGRADE.  I cannot believe how much I like this game.  So interesting.  UPGRADE.  This is embarrassing.  I haven't been hooked on a game like this in a long time.  UPDATE.  Yep, its love.  DOWNGRADE. Brink of War killed my enthusiasm for Race.

I ranked it a "7" but I really don't know how to even rank this game.  I recognize the absolute greatness of the game, and yet all the symbology is majorly confusing.  Its not just me, others are befuddled as well. We constantly have to look up the symbols.  And sometimes the specific one isn't there, you have to infer from other symbols in the rule book.  

It never hits the gaming table any more because of this issue.  I'm not at all opposed to giving it more of a chance, but there are just too many other games out there to bother with it at this point.  Which is too bad.  (somehow Core Worlds makes up for it?)

I'll keep it, hoping that some day (in a fantasy world) I'll break it out with someone who is an expert instructor.

What can I say? Race for the Galaxy (RtfG) is a great game. If you like San Juan but think that its gameplay gets a little repetitive in the end, then RftG should be right for you. Tons of different cards guarantee a wide range of possible strategies. 
But there is also a fair word of warning: Learning this game and it's strategies means WORK. This is okay for me, but some people I know and play with don't want to put that much effort into a game. First you have to deal with all the icons and even guys that I normally consider great gamers had problems in dealing with them. Even after 15 games they still had to look up some of them in the manual. It wouldn't surprise me, if a lot of people quit playing the game because they can't get their head around the icons. I finally managed to understand them (after ~10 Games) but I'm still not convinced that they're the best way to present the abilities of the cards.
Once you've got the icons down, your next task will be to learn all the different cards and find some nice combos. For me, this part is where the fun of RftG comes from. But I'm quite sure, that this aspect can become a deal breaker for some people new to the game. They won't be able to compete with more experienced players and will soon discover, that some effort is needed to play this game well. Hopefully they are willing to invest it into this great game.

+ Great replayability because of tons of possible card combos.

+ San Juan Advanced: I like the core mechanics of San Juan and RftG really enhances the experience.

o Steep learning curve: While I like it, I'm sure, quite a few people won't be willing to invest that much time in a game.

o Multiplayer Solitaire/Lack of interaction: This game doesn't really have any direct conflict or player interaction except from the role selection. And even calling this "direct conflict" is a long shot. For me, the fun of this games comes from building my own empire and dealing with the cards I've got in my hand the best way I can. But I truly understand people, who aren't satisfied by "just" optimising their cards and resources.

o/- I still don't like the icons.

Absolutely love this game.  It seems to be very hit and miss with other players though, some people catch on immediately and others don't seem very interested in trying again even though I have a feeling they'd love it if given a chance.

I think the Iconography system is fantastic and makes it easier to play whereas most non-gamers (and some regular gamers) find it to be a huge turnoff.  I guess it just looks too scary to them, but once you learn it you will understand its greatness ;)

Received from Secret Santa '07

If I had one word to describe this game, it would be Theme, theme, theme,... 
(OK, that's 3 words, but you get the point)

Really, I do like this game. The card art is stunning, and really enhances the play, at least for me.  I like that it has been designed very open-ended, with features that will only be used in future expansions.  I can't wait for those.

My one real problem with this game is the rules.  They are not clear at all.  In fact, in a lot of cases, they appear to be deliberately ambiguous. That makes it hard to play correctly.  All the different symbols are also difficult to learn.  I know that I've screwed up every time I've played it.  I hope that someday, I'll get a chance to play it correctly, but my game group doesn't care much for it.

Decided not to wait.  Traded if for a whole lot of GeekGold.

I've said it before, and I'll say it again.  If I want a deck-building card game, I'll stick with Magic.  I like it better.  I also like San Juan better than this.  Less complicated.

This is a great version of San Juan meets Magic the Gathering.  Not as complicated as Magic but much meatier than SJ.  Even so, it was over-whelming for me me during my first play.  Too many icons that I couldn't place well.  Maybe I'll enjoy it more during my second play.  I'm one of those gamers that only likes a few options, but I want them to be difficult decisions.  This was not that game.

Fast hand management game in which you build an engine to get lots of victory points. Very good and interesting game, only complaint might be that there's not much direct player interaction (none at all). It's still fast enough to be fun, so I don't mind that much. Good quality cards.

Im giving this one a high rating.  While player interaction is limited,  I feel that the game mechanics are solid and since it is not a fighter (in any way shape or form)  I'll forgive the lack of deep player interaction.  For me I really think the use of the cards is exceptional, it reminds me of the efficiency of a card battle game to get all the components taken care of.  I only wish that someone would take the same concept and take it to that level of player interaction that many people are looking for

Been playing this some more and I continue to like it more and more. Lots of strategies and agonising decisions to make. The card art is great and the cards good quality - theme and card effetcs are nicely tied together.

Loses half a mark for me as it's not a boardgame - I do like a spatial element to my games and also, like most card games, it still suffers from the fact that with reasonably competent players the game will be decided, regardless of the quality of play, by the cards you draw. Even so, the experience you have is still most enjoyable.

I have played 100's of times online using the marvellous Keldon version of the game.

Fantastic game really despite some misgivings before playing as San Juan isn't one of my favourite games. Here it all fits together and despite it's a sort of solitaire there's still interaction when you guess what "roles" the other players will chose.

This really should be good.  The cards are interesting, and they have lots of cool powers.  But getting interesting combos takes 4-5 cards, and the randomness of card drawing means that you'll be at like 9 or 10 (out of 12) before you get something together.  It's like playing a CCG in a sealed starter format.  The coolness is there, but you just aren't allowed to play with it.

A lot like San Juan.  However this game differs in that there is very little player interaction.  You are not competing for roles.  Instead you can choose any role at any time and everyone gets to execute the action.  It turns into a little bit of blind bidding.  I don't mind it, but I mention it because I know others do.  One thing I don't like is that actions 1-3 are executed based on the action card.  Actions 4 & 5 are executed based on what cards you have in front of you.  Not very intuitive on the first play.  This is a game you need to play several times before getting a handle on how everything works.

Like this game a lot, it manages to be complex and streamlined at the same time.  Has a bit of a learning curve (managed to get some of the rules wrong even into the third game), but the iconography is really well designed and ultimately it's not as hard to master as it first seems.  A bit random (like any card drawing game) but still has a lot of strategic depth.  Would like to try the expansions.

RATING: 10
Race For the Galaxy was one of the first games that I played when getting into designer board games, and it stands as the one that has sat in my Top 10 for the longest. This comes from both its exceptional longevity and its exceptional quality. There are few games that I have encountered that combined its sheer replayability and great depth. Even now, with almost 400 plays under my belt, I still encounter new situations and new strategies, things that surprise and delight, and cement this in my mind as the pinnacle of the variable action selection games. 

That is not to say I do not appreciate Glory to Rome, Puerto Rico, and San Juan, I really do, but they lack the sheer variability and strategic expanse that Race For the Galaxy has to offer. Each decision has a tremendous, yet suble, impact on the overall game state, creating constant hurdles that the players must react against, either taking advantage of the opportunities that are offered, or ignoring them and hoping that the tempo loss can be made up for elsewhere. Each card drawn creates a new opportunity for the development of an individual's galactic empire, and deciding which of these will provide the greatest chance for victory and which are false paths that will only lead to ruin only adds to the games replayability. 

Puerto Rico lacks Race For the Galaxy's variety, exchanging that for a lower level of luck. San Juan lacks Race For the Galaxy's variety but also has more luck than Puerto Rico. The only real advantage it has over Race For the Galaxy is its relative simplicity. While a few may find that preferable, I do not. I am no longer interested in "gateway games." Glory to Rome has even more luck than Race For the Galaxy, but lacks much of its variety. It is still an interesting games, but doesn't quite measure up to Race For the Galaxy's elegance and tension.

Players are developing a trading empire in space.  Players simultaneously reveal an action card which defines the action phases played this turn - take cards, build developments and worlds, earn cash and victory points, produce stuff.  The idea is to build an efficient economic engine that churns out this stuff.  I'm not sure of the history, but this is 70% San Juan, 25% Puerto Rico, all bumped up a bit in complexity.  In reality it isn't complex at all, but there is a lot of stuff buried here in all the cards and associated different icons.  It will take a few games to grasp it all, for those that want to fight the insane iconography.  We didn't - San Juan suits us just fine.  

Positives?  An excellent example of bad production.

Similar role selection mechanics to Puerto Rico. I also think it's neat that the cards have multiple uses, but it's always hard to choose which cards to sell. The numerous symbols create a bit of a learning curve. I always feel like the game ends just as I'm getting my plan to work, but I haven't tried changing the end conditions yet. The game feels a little like multiplayer solitaire, but that's okay because the strategy is engaging. I think the art style is so-so. My wife likes this game because you can't do anything mean to other players. I'm still enjoying the base game, but I'm thinking that I need to get some expansion cards to freshen it up.

But I'm not sure that at the end of the day it really does a lot more than San Juan, which features more player-competition and a few more creative ways for cards to interact between each other. Despite these quibblings I realy enjoy the game, recommmend it, and would rarely turn down a game. However I'm not convinced my cramped shelf has enough space.

Idea:
Cardgame where cards are played and act as money to pay for the played cards.

Mechanism:
Each player choose action type that they get bonus, and only chosen action types are resolved each round. (explore for new cards / play 'development' / play 'planet' / sell good for cards / sell good for points / produce goods on planets). Try to play cards that combine well with other cards and try to anticipate what actions others choose to get best advantage.

to who:
Winning needs strategy but game itself isnt too heavy, extreamely well playable 1vs1 too. To be useful for more games expansions.

Own views:
One of my wifes favourites thus one of most played 1on1 game here. Would be even better if some cards werent broken compared to their play cost.

People who love CCGs will love this one.  It is like San Juan in space, only you have a much greater control and impact over the game due to your expanded role selection and a greater influence of in play cards affecting those roles.  Like Dominion, its flaw comes in its lack of direct interaction (though there is subtle control in recognizing the limits of what the opponent can play or in choosing a role when they are not prepared to utilize it well).

I like this game.   The trouble is, two of the regulars I play with don't.  I understand why they don't; in order to do well in this game you need to memorize most of the cards, or at least understand the basic ratio of the cards to know what is and is not likely to appear.  They don't like that because they haven't memorized the cards, and can't easily remember what the complex symbols on the cards mean.  The only time I really get to play this game is solitaire, which is fun, but not excellent.  I'll hold onto this game because I do like it, but I don't have much hope of getting it to the table very often with this group of fiends.

RATING: 7
I don't generally tend to like complex-card-games, but I've enjoyed my plays of Race quite a bit. The primary differentiation, I think, is the way Race encourages continual movement of cards through hands, which allows players to control the direction of their engine instead of forcing the players down particular narrow paths (or forcing them to dig for answers). More experienced players might feel more constrained, but after 20 plays I still find additional ways to play out hands.

The player interaction is a bit indirect for my tastes, but there's actually quite a bit of room for doublethink and playing off of opponent's phase selections. The number of special powers on each card ensure that phase selection is almost never a no-brainer; players need to take into account their own bonuses, phase selection bonuses, and the probable selections of opponents.

As befitting a complex card game, there's a ton of different cards that could potentially be memorized, but you mainly need to recognize the different classes they fall into. Production, consumption, military, and development-based seem to be the big ones, but it's possible that there's further room to explore.

All in all, I enjoy Race quite a bit, and am happy to play it with anyone capable of understanding the icons. (No mean feat, but the game is worth it.)

Played it 2p and liked it.
Purchased the expansion and played it solo, and liked it.
Played it 4p, and one player spammed cheap improvements to end the game as quickly as possible - and that broke the game for me. I wanted an engine-builder where I could pursue a strategy, and the above 'strategy' basically threw that out the window.
Would try again with a different group.

Like many others I find the lack of player interaction in this game very frustrating. Once someone gets ahead there's nothing you can do to stop them and restore balance to the game. Come on let me attack someone else's planets to either take them over or destroy them. Nice graphics and interesting abilities on the cards are just smoke and mirrors for a nice game of simultaneous solitaire that favors the person who has memorized all the cards. Luckily it's quick enough that I'll play it if someone wants to but I won't be the one suggesting it.

Personally, I would have liked a bit more thematic development- characters and storyline elements- but that's a minor quibble.

A space race for victory points with dual-use cards.

I like that the cards have a dual use- can either be played in the tableau or discarded as currency. Unfortunately the game is not very well-balanced, and the suggested starting worlds can funnel players into pre-determined strategies, with one start world consistently having the greatest advantage.

Race for the Galaxy is absolutely my most-played game, with a lot of 3p and 2p experiences.  Also probably around 200 2p games vs. Keldon's AI.  I've played this over 1000 times now at least.

The expansions are incredible and really liven up the game.  Highly recommended purchases once you've played the base game 20-30 times.

Once you get accustomed to all the symbols, this game has a nice flow. Can be a drag if someone is stalling the game by overanalysing, and some cards and combos seem very overpowered (though they are not and the perception changes with more plays). The game offers some very interesting choices both in long term strategy, and short term tactics. The replay value is massive. There are just so many different strategies to explore. Excellent game that I expect will be played for a very long time. Gets played at least a few times almost every game night.

RATING: 9
I initially had mixed feelings about this game.  Seemed over-rated, and the complete lack of interaction (apart from second-guessing your opponent's action card) made it a tough sell.  However, there seems to be a ton of potential here that the expansions might capitalize on. And the CCG-like hunt for card combos makes it always interesting to play.  But there is absolutely nothing you can do to stop someone who gets their efficiency engine up and running early, and midway through the game you can tell if you will lose.   On the plus side, it plays really fast once you get past the iconography learning curve.  The icons are excellent, and art is too, although much of it is far too darkly printed.  I have a sneaky suspicion that part of the reason people are reacting so positively to this game is because light Euros with a cool sci-fi theme are so very rare.  Often one play isn't enough.

RATING: 8.5
I remember how much I liked my first game of Race, and I still do.  It's a quick, fun game with lots of different cards, many potential building strategies, good scaling with any number of players, and attractive theme/art.  

I have to complain about every game, though, so I may as well begin.  Obviously, it's a card game with a shared deck.  That means that you can get an initial hand (or continuing draws) that does nothing to advance the build you've chosen or lacks any synergy with the start world you were dealt (or any internal synergies).  Yes, you can keep selecting explore to try and draw into some better stuff, but the game isn't that long, and the other players who've drawn better cards will be pulling away.
I'm not sure that all the builds are equally balanced in the base game.  It feels like produce/consume is a bit easier to do than military, and specialized stuff like alien or dev is going to be tough.  This is far from certain, though.  
Oh, and the iconography, while consistent and fairly understandable, is always a pain to try and teach to new players.  Some of them get it, some of 'em don't.

Anyway, this is still getting played, and I expect it will for many years to come.

Several times it has felt like the winner is the person who surprises everyone else near the end of the game by playing a high-scoring card that combines with what they've built so far.

Compare this to the way powerful cards are added to a tableau in Glory to Rome: the cards become visible, then they're be completed on a later turn. The more powerful the card, the longer it takes to complete.

In Race for the Galaxy, powerful cards can be added without players having to publicly show progress to add them.

It makes the game feel luckier, less tense, and less interactive.

Also, the game's complexity seems too high for its length.

This game is tough to teach and it takes time to get use to the icons. I was almost in disaster-land teaching my family the first time. It did not help that I did not know the game very well. It does have a lot of similarities to San Juan, but on the surface it seems to have a lot of additional complexities. It has very little interaction, which can be nice at times. If this game catches on with my family and it can show that it has re playability it's rating could go much higher. Time will tell. I hope it caches on.

Update: It did catch on, rating went up. Went up again.

This is a phenomenon when it comes to Sci-Fi titles. Even though it's just a few cards, the genre fits this game perfectly not only because you can fell how your personal galactic empire grows under your directive, but also thanks to some common mechanics characteristic for (let's call them) much heavier brothers like TI which immediately come to mind (even though it's a different title entirely). RFTG is a very quick game once you get a hold of all the possible actions (there aren't all that many), however the amount of possible routes you can take while planning each move would suggest otherwise - yet another phenomenon of RFTG. Love it.

Pretty much two-player solitaire with just a bit of interaction. And yet, it's two-player solitaire that I love to play. The iconography takes a few plays to get used to the nuances, but after that it actually is very intuitive. Reasonably short play (between 15-30 minutes per game), but when you finish a game, you want to start right up with another. I'm a little concerned about the long-term replayability, but for now, I'm really enjoying it. Not surprisingly, somewhat similar to San Juan and I recommend you play San Juan before you play this, but they still scratch different itches, so it's worth picking up both. Enjoy!

Wonderful and justifiably praised space civilization building card game. Player's turns are simultaneous with each player selecting a strategy for that turn Puerto Rico (San Juan, TI3) style giving all other players secondary ability of the chosen strategy. That is one of my favourite mechanics in board games.
Also cards can be installed to players talon as planets or upgrades, or spent face down as resources.

The game is basically race for the win, which gets better with the first expansion, but player interaction is limited only to strategy selection so it feels a lot like a multiplayer solitaire. This changes with adding more expansions.

[b]Edit:[/b] Upgraded to 8.5 with Gathering Storm expansion.

[b]Favorite mechanism:[/b] Like in Puerto Rico, role selection which gives everybody the same action but gives an exclusive bonus to the player who selected the role.

RATING: 6
trade note; includes first three expansions, only one box, which has shelf ware, but otherwise in very good condition. Also, i'd sell it all for £40.


I'm fairly late to the party on this. At a mechanical level this is a card engine building game. Play cards that allow you to play more cards, develop combos, earn lots of victory points. It uses the action selection mechanism from Puerto Rico but feels a lot more like Glory to Rome or Fleet in play. I'm not sure whether i prefer it to those other two games though.

having played a dozen or so games i have started to get it. Its a decent enough game but doesn't really rock my world. It is largely a game about knowing the cards and seeing the best combo's/build orders. The expansions mostly just add clutter imo. Though the extra cards are cool.

I like this game: good artwork, and a large range of strategic options. It can however be hard at first to wrap your mind around the fact that cards can be either used "as is", as currency or as wares.

Race to Produce/Consume. I enjoy Race - it does indeed feel like a race - but there appears to be a dominant strategy despite situational tactics, leaving one susceptible to poor luck.

Confusing. Not for the colored blind. Has a San Juan feel with a little more meat.

Something I would play again, but not buy.

Too much info on cards. I was confused, didn't know what I was doing and what was what at start of the game. At the end, it was more clear for me. Easier to learn as you play than trying having someone explaining the rules and trying to understand what he is saying. Not sure about its replay value.

Over complicated for a card game in my opinion.

*UPDATE*

Played again recently. Had more fun this time around. Had a better understanding of the game. Didn't play very well, but had fun nevertheless. Have a little higher opinion this time around.


* UPDATE 2 *

Played 2 more games. Less confusion and had easier time with the colors. Played two 3 player game. First one I got my ass whoop. Second game it finish 30-28-28 for me.

I might now consider getting this game in my collection.

First games was a disaster, and I suspect my daughter will run a mile when I suggest the game again.  My wife persevered, but we did not finish the game.  I will be able to use blackmail though to get more games of this, as it was she who bought it!!!

Played a few more times ... and it really really grows on you.  I really want to play more!!!!

Further edits - this game does grow on you and is my favourite (but waiting for Agricola to catch up!!!)

I like it, but I'm not as crazy about it as others in my group. I haven't played enough to understand (or memorize) the iconography. I hope there's more player interaction in the expansion. Pros: Plays fairly quickly. Cons: You aren't playing against other people, so much as you are playing against a deck of cards.

This game might be fun if it was not extremely difficult to pick up.  In many games, the learning curve can be half the game, or even a full game, before you know what you're doing.  In Race, the curve is 3 or 4 games.  I don't want to play something 4 times before I know what I'm doing.

I find it engaging enough, and the wife likes it because I cannot attack her directly.  You just have to outperform the other person.  The only actual interaction is sometimes trying to predict what phase your opponent will pick so you can get that phase as well as the one you are choosing.

My favorite game.  Love that feeling of accumulating cards, building big stuff, anticipating your opponents' actions, and not knowing how many points you have until the end.  I play a lot of 2-player, which I love, but I can admit that it's more like 2-player solitaire.

RATING: 6
A more complicated relation to San Juan. A good game, but the added complexity may pale in comparison to the more streamlined San Juan.  On the negative side, in comparison to SJ, the decisions in RftG seem more obvious and easier to make, and as a result lack the angst that SJ can create.

In summary, a good game that I like that I most likely will not buy because it just isn't as good as San Juan that I already own.

dropped a 1/2 point to 6 since it is so difficult for new players to get up to speed and it makes it difficult to get it to the table when you have a blend of experience around the table.

Brilliant game, great amount of depth and fantastic artwork.

I love the space theme, but the iconography is extremely convoluted and takes multiple plays to understand enough to become efficient in any strategy. While I still believe this is an excellent replacement for San Juan, I could not teach new players enough in 2-3 games to make it worthwhile. Also, your strategy is sort of driven by the cards dealt, with little room to fight the tide.

2013-08-19 : Played it a lot on the computer and a couple of times vs humans - after 50 plays it feels a bit played out, but still a solid 9
2015-03-03 : Haven't played it since, which means I'm in no hurry to play it again anytime soon, so the rating drops 
2016-10-07 : Finally hit the table again and I'm once again reminded of how fine a design this is. After so many years my mojo for playing it is back.
2017-05-27 : Installed the game on the pc again and after a rusty start - a dozen losses in a row - finally managed a win again - 35 points in 11 rounds and a win on the cards in hand tiebreaker. This is without a doubt the toughest AI for any game out there.

Despite being a bit overwhelming at the beginning, when you get the grasp of it you realize how great this game is. Flows like clockwork and even though there is not much interaction, I do not find it a con. If I want interaction I will simply play something else. If I want to have good laughs with some friends while playing a card game, I will play Race for the Galaxy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
UPDATE: I still love RFTG, but I'm afraid to use the second expansion (haven't even gotten the third) because I'm concerned that the game is really getting bloated from its original roots of a shortish card game to one that is way too long and complicated for what it is. (I still feel that RFTG and RvI is one of my top games and am looking forward to the eventual publishing of Alien Artifacts.)

UPDATE: Giving it a 10 now with the first expansion. A great game and not as hard to decipher the cards as the haters will tell you.

The only reason that I haven't rated this one a 10 yet is because I'm late to the Race for the Galaxy party.

This is a fantastic game with a lot of the things I really enjoy -- building an economic machine but not getting hosed by turn order (cough*Puerto Rico*cough) and of course, I like the sci-fi theme instead of Yet Another Rennaisance Trading Game. It's a great collectible card-like game without the massive expense.

The game seems balanced without having the One Clear Path to Victory, and there's the possibility for more expansion packs.

Have just played for the first time. Initially rather bewildering but we had got the hang of it by the end and will certainly be trying it out again! Rating upgraded after playing a couple more times. It doesn't have the simple elegance of San Juan, but is certainly worth a go. Having played several more times, with various numbers of players, I've upgraded my rating even further - it certainly grows on you, plays quickly enough for several games in succession to be viable and hasn't got boring. Having played quite a few more times I have upgraded my rating to 10 - I'm always happy to play it. It's taken 6 months to get there for me but it's done it!

RATING: 7
San Juan is often considered to be a similar game to Puerto Rico that's less complicated and in card form. RFTG is a step up in complexity when compared to San Juan and probably at a similar level to Puerto Rico. The most notable thing about the game is the iconography which tends to drive some people crazy due to being too complex or swoon over how elegant the icons match the effects of a card allowing it to be deduced at a glance. I fall into the second category and look forward to exploring the deep strategies which are in the game and the two expansions that are currently released. This is really good, especially considering how much I enjoyed the San Juan which doesn't have nearly as much diversity. Even if San Juan was as diverse the role selecting mechanism in Race for the Galacxy is definitely more enjoyable. A very good game!! Race for the Galaxy fired Puerto Rico, for me.

Upon further plays of just the base game, I consider at least one of the expansions to be mandatory to get the best enjoyment out of Race. That's the only reason why I rate the base game a 7.

This game has grown on me over several plays. I still like San Juan better. I do like this more than Puerto Rico. However, the mechanics and various card abilities are just over-thought to me with this game. The goals and robot are required, in my opinion.

Amazing game but the first sit down is a real struggle.  This game has a ton of symbology that while good is impossible to decipher your first game.  Even after numerous games an occasional card will still confuse you.  Once you are past the hurdle though it is a great, clean, and varied experience that plays quick for its depth

Learning on my own with the Keldon Jones program. The learning curve is a bit ridiculous, but I am very slowly beginning to glean how this game is played, I think. Playing my physical copy with an actual human being is going to be interesting (my poor wife), and I can see why this game can be hard to get to the table. 

It's very clever, but to be honest, the theme does feel pasted on, dated artwork not withstanding. Often I am so focused on the symbols that the underlying art/theme simply doesn't register, so whatever narrative power the cards may have is lost.

Looking forward to finally understanding this game...

Even though I often feel that there is not enough player interaction in Race for the Galaxy, I still love it.  I love how there are so many strategies which can evolve based on the cards you're dealt.

I did co-create an Variant which increases the player interaction by adding the concept of Solar Systems.  It's too long to describe in detail here, but essentially the military is localized, there are bonuses for developing non-military worlds of certain types in certain solar systems, and there are takeover rules.  It's a lot of fun 2 player but I haven't tried it with 3+.

While quite fun, the game lacks any real interaction.  The game is a tad confusing at start, but that quickly goes away after you play a couple rounds.

Update Aug08, after several plays of the published version: A must buy. More interactive than San Juan, but certainly less so than Glory to Rome. All three are great games, but I still think GtR is a notch above RftG.

I've played the prototype a few times, and I think that as a member of the San Juan family of card games, it comes in above San Juan but below Glory to Rome. It's a definite pickup when it gets released.

RATING: 6
Of the Puerto Rico style games, this sits near the bottom; its a bit better than San Juan, but doesn't wag a finger at Puerto Rico or Roll for the Galaxy. The secret Phase/Role selection is great, and inserts a level of deduction into the game, but more often than not I find myself simply selecting phases based on which privilege is the most beneficial, rather than trying to piggyback off of my opponents, making the gameplay too straightforward for my tastes. It also plays too quickly and prevents players from becoming invested in the world's and developments their are using to build out their tableau.

Advanced San Juan.  There's a bit of a learning curve with all the specific iconography.  Every player always has every role available to them, and there's many more cards, with less duplication than San Juan.  The deck is also larger, and you'll see less "burn" through the deck as in San Juan.  If you like San Juan, you'll probably like this, particularly if you like science fiction.  The game seems very "tight".

Great game. Variety of cards makes it highly replayable and interesting. Very mechanically elegant and wonderfully strategic as well as tactical.

I consider the lack of interaction only a slight downside. The use of cards as the only resource is kind of a feel-bad mechanic because you have to give up some possibilities to make progress. It's especially bad if all of the cards you draw have some level of synergy with each other and you have to choose which ones are worth keeping.

Jury is still out on this game.  I think the combinations of cards and the idea behind the game is excellet but I do feel it has too much of a solitaire feel.  There really is no interaction between players other than choosing the actions for the turn and that is limited.  I just think Domaine has more interaction.  Also, the symbols, though they work for me, are a bear to teach to anyone else and it can really turn others off real quickly.

You wanted San Juan with a little more? Here it is. Not as elegant a system because of VP chits, but also adds another aspect because the game can end when you run them out. No more player position problems because roles are chosen simultaniously. 
Main drawback to this game is that it is hard to look at opponent's cards and tell what they can do. This is necessary for good play.

Is there still a place for San Juan on my shelf? I think so, as it is more accessible to the non-gamer.

Fun card game, about establishing a powerful galatic presence. You start off with a single homeworld, and work towards adding new worlds and new assets to your territory. Each round lets players explore, invest in developments, settle planets, consume and produce resources.

This game is a great engine building/card combo game for 3 to 4

An all-time favorite.  Playable in 20-30 minutes, but contains the best elements of Puerto Rico, streamlined into a CCG-style format.  If I could rate the combination of this plus The Gathering Storm expansion it would be a solid 10 - nearly infinitely replayable with hundreds of strategic routes available, not to mention a fun solitaire variant.  Lowest luck factor of any card game I've played, as a good player can adapt to nearly any draw.  I can't imagine ever getting tired of this.

What can I say that hasn't already been said? It feels as fantastic as Puerto Rico did when it was new, with the added benefits of being so much faster and substantially more replayable. I've found that the two player advanced game is better even than the four player game, and that the three player game isn't much worse than the four.

That said, it's painful to go back to the base game after playing with The Gathering Storm, Rebel vs. Imperium and The Brink of War.

(As of [b]6+[/b] plays) A hand-management card game with great depth but also an almost off-puttingly steep learning curve. The complexity that makes this such an intriguing game also makes it feel a bit too fiddly to properly enjoy without committing lots of familiarization time to it. Several unlogged solo plays with [url=http://www.keldon.net/rftg/]Keldon's RftG AI[/url], but not something that hits the actual table very often.

[b]1 year verdict:[/b] Still a good game, even though it doesn't get any face-to-face plays. Keldon's AI has replaced Solitaire for me as my go-to computer time-wasting game.

I love the concept of racing (no pun intended) to build the most valuable empire through either colonization and treaty or conquest. The role selection and multiple uses of cards are seen in other games but are well established here.

One detractor is the complex language of symbols used to identify card bonuses. This has proved, for me, to be a consistent hindrance to introducing new players to the game.

(Rating including expansions: [thing=40210]Rebel vs Imperium[/thing], [thing=66121]The Brink of War[/thing])

It may take a while to get into because of the iconography, but it's actually done pretty intuitively and the game comes with thorough player aids.

However, I do agree that the game is much easier to learn if someone teaches the game than straight from the rulebook.

It may feel a bit solitary, because there's no direct player interaction. Nonetheless, you still have to closely watch what other people are doing so you know which phases to pick. It takes a few games to get the hang of it, but once you do it plays fast and offers tons of replayability even without the expansions. What I also love about this game is that there's almost zero setup time and it plays vastly different each time depending on your starting planet and your starting hand.

Extremely fast game that is entertaining from beginning to end. Every game is different and there is a ton of strategic depth that has yet to be explored. Each game you have to maximize your own tableau while also remembering that this game is a race against your opponents. Do you end the game early so that your opponents do not have time to create a production engine or do you wait it out and starve your opponent of the victory point tokens? High replayability. Do not see this game leaving the collection anytime soon or quite possibly ever.

A reworked card game based on Puerto Rico, but more complex and potentially rewarding than San Juan.  Downsides: lots of symbols in an effort to make it language independent; sci-fi theme; less interaction and more solitaire play (roles are picked simultaneously); similar to San Juan thus redundant if you have that?.

I bought this as a lunch break game to play with a guy at work who has a lot of experience with MtG. I am really enjoying it and can see why people like it better than Roll (a favorite of mine).

Why is a game that is essentially a San Juan makeover so fascinating and fun?  Probably because it brings the basic idea of San Juan to new heights through avenues such as production/consumption matching, military conquest, and development strategies.  The result is a game that is fresh and exciting every time.  Yes, there's a bit of a learning curve, but after a few games (which only run 30 minutes tops) you've got it down.  After that it is a joy to explore the many ways that the cards can work together.

RATING: 10
7 plays - 7/10: it's enjoyable but i don't know where to even begin strategically, which doesn't motivate me to play it again.


10 plays - 8/10: I'd decided to give this a second chance just in case.  I'm definitely enjoying it more as i play it and figure it out more.


15 plays - 9/10: Love it, but the icon system and consume phase are counter-intuitive.  It's also taking me a long time to figure out consume strategies, and i have difficulty playing hands without obvious synergies.


25 plays - 10/10: and there we have it, that says it all.  I now realize the reason it took me a long time to understand and enjoy the game was that my teacher didn't do a great job.  I will be teaching this to many people and they will like it a lot better a lot faster cuz i'll do it right.

67 plays (265 incl. TGS) - 9/10: downgraded this to reflect that despite loving r4tg, TGS is a hell of a lot better.

89 plays (467 incl. TGS/RvI) - 9.9/10: what i should have downgraded it to in the first place, just that i don't really use decimal ratings.

264 plays - 10: remains at this rating. While the base game feels a little simplistic and routine after more than 2,000 plays of various Race formats, it's still the grandaddy/foundation of all variations of by far the best game to date, and therefore an automatic 10.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Lovely fast, portable game, with depth.  Great with 2 players, or with 3 or 4.  It only really gets rewarding after a few plays, however.  

No need for expansions, the base game plays very well for hundreds of plays, making it great value for money.

There is a significant learning curve - the learners will have to want to learn to play it, or will have to have some patience.  Their first couple of plays may be a little overwhelming - too much to read.  I normally suggest they go for a military victory, as that allows them to pay less attention to the cards' produce and consume bonuses and to focus mostly on the first 3 phases (explore, develop, settle).

Fantastic introduction to a tableau building game.  Learning to capitalize on the margins will take you a long way.  This base set provides exactly enough complexity to be interesting without overwhelming people.

Regarding the symbols, just play it a few times and you'll be very happy they're there.  Part of why this game only takes half an hour to play is because of the ease to read the cards' abilities.

I really enjoy every match of this game. I like the setting. I don't like the icons, and the action cards expecially for a 2 players game are a bit cumbersome (take down your cards, take up the action cards, play them, retake the other cards, etc.) Another mechanism would have been faster, but it was probably a design/costs factor, and the cards functions pretty well anyway.

Having started with Roll (which I own), I've now secured a copy of Race and the 1st expansion.  Owning both isn't duplicating the game experience.  Both employ similar mechanics in terms of action selection/multiple use of dice/cards, but are very different games.

Great game. You'll have trouble talking non-gamers into giving it a chance, and many gamers prefer Roll for the Galaxy due to its ease of entry. But this game really rewards repeat play.  There are so many different strategies that can lead to a win that it continually feels fresh.

I strongly recommend that before playing live, players download the free pc version of the game and practice playing against the AI (which is very well programmed). Knowledge of the cards and the kinds of possible strategies is key. Playing with the AI will immensely help new players overcome the initial barriers to entry.

I am still very much on the learning curve, but RftG continues to grow on me.  The first couple of games were daunting in not really understanding how the different cards and powers work.

My initial rating was a 6, but as I am beginning to understand how the cards and powers fit together, things are starting to click and I am beginning to really enjoy this game.  Rating was upgraded to 7 after 5 or 6 games and then 8 after more and the realization of how depth is in here.

ORIGINAL COMMENTS: Seems deeper than it's colonial counterpart San Juan. It takes a while to decipher the language independent glyphs, but once you do, there's a great game with a lot of depth and multiple paths to victory. It's a great opener and finisher to any game night.

ADD: I've found that there is just too much going on in this game that makes it almost unwinable for me. I tend to play with people who play this *a lot* so it's typical I get left in the dust. New expansions only heighten this. RftG may be the darling non-CCG, but it has lost some of its charm with me.

RATING: 8
My only complaint is that the box is too big.  I know their excuse is so that expansions will fit, and the full-side reference cards are nice, but I would have preferred an FFG-style 8"x4" box instead.

Rating based on my one play so far, taught it to three coworkers.  Spent a lot of time looking at the reference cards, and had to check the rules twice.  Halfway thru the game I felt like I understood all of the icons.  I love games where the cards have multiple uses, and the fact that many cards enter and leave play face down means that you never see the entire deck.  I'm an engineer by trade, and this game's design seems exceptionally elegant and appealing to me.

Okay, played it again 2p today, and was able to pay closer attention to what my opponent was doing.  We didn't play with the advanced extra role cards, and there were several occasions that we managed to pick the same action.

Many people have complained about the relatively low player interaction in this game.  That actually appeals to me -- I like my games to be friendly, and sometimes direct confrontation is contrary to that goal.  As others have pointed out, there is still plenty of interaction; you are always trying to figure out what everybody else is going to do so that you can call the action you *really* need for yourself.

I can't stop thinking about this game.  Last time I obsessed like this was for RRT, and that game has a much greater setup and time commitment, along with the sinking feeling that a bad opening move can ruin your entire game.  RftG on the other hand seems much more fluid, although I can see the complaints that just as you really get things rolling the game ends.  But that just means that you have to plan your tableau carefully to maximize your victory points.

This may be a bit presumptuous, but I think this is going to be my first "ten" after a few more plays.

I've since played this four more times.  I still think pretty highly of it, but it does seem like the game always ends right when things really get rolling, usually a turn or two before you were ready.  It's sometimes frustrating to be unable to really directly affect your opponents, although that's just the nature of this game.  It's also why the game plays so quickly too, so it's a trade off I'm willing to make.

Two more plays, finally, four players.  Got spanked by somebody getting Consumer Markets down in both games.  Wasn't playing my best because I was teaching it again.

Played one more time the next day, 2p, and got Diversified Economy down instead of Consumer Markets.  Pulled 10VP on the last turn of the game for the win.

Came back again to make sure I'd changed my rating on this to a ten.  I already had.  This game is just about perfect.  One of my coworkers is addicted to it so we play almost every day now.  

Coming back several months later, I'm lowering my rating a bit because I haven't played it in a while.

I have trouble ranking the base game and the different expansions separately.  I've played extensively with the first two expansions, but very little without.  To me Race for the Galaxy is RftG + RvI +TGS.  My only complaint with the base game is that you need the two expansions to get the full range of strategies. 

I think the tableau building is the part that speaks to me the most.  Individual bonuses, multiple paths to victory, relatively short playtime, incredible depth, multi-player solitaire (yes, as a positive), all make this one of my favorite games.  I can't imagine ever tiring of it.

My husband and I love this game, and despite reviews saying it was complicated  due to the iconography, we find it to be pretty intuitive.

I'm a huge fan of this game.  The symbol-heavy vocabulary can be daunting to new players, but this is one of those games that really clicks after a demo round.  

The first expansion is highly recommended; it really should have been part of the base game, as it fleshes out some alternate paths to victory that are otherwise a little anemic.

I've known how to play this game since it came out and never really enjoyed it. I always just found it too complicated. After playing San Juan extensively one summer I wanted something more and picked up three expansions and the base game. I also played a ton against the keldon AI to learn the cards. 

I really don't think there is any game out there that has so much depth that can be playing in under 20 minutes. I find it highly enjoyable now. 

I'd suggest make a friend learning San Juan until you both bored, pick up Race, learn the keldon AI gradually adding the expansions and 2 player advanced, and then duke it out ftf using just the first two expansions with no takeovers. 

For me this game took a lot of work - not because of the symbols - its just a hard game to learn how to play. Totally worth the effort!

RATING: 6.5
I can see why this is attracting so much attention, and there's a lot here for hardened gamers, but there's a basic problem. It's a solitaire game. No inter-action. Yes, it's true that you can look at other people's tableaux and try to decide their action, and that can affect your own choice. But essentially you are playing your hand alone. I also mark it down because it's not a game you can play straight from the box (unless you've a brain the size of a planet). You need a learning game at least, and that's a negative mark in my book. Plus, a lot of the rules conditions are fiddly, tiny little symbols on the card qualify rules, and that causes confusion. RFTG is clearly a very good game, and presses all the buttons for PR/St Petersburg fans. But it's not quite my cup of tea and it's not all that. Nice graphics, nice cards, nice theme, not all that.

Currently I'm playing this game multiple times per week.  I'm thoroughly addicted to trying a different strategy each time.  Highly recommended for the expert gamer, but it can be overwhelming for casual gamers and needs to be played multiple times to "get it".  While the "lack of interaction" has been cited by many, I think there's plenty of interaction in the simultaneous bidding that needs to be mastered if one wants to win a significant percentage of games.

Rating includes The Gathering Storm. This rating is for two-player advanced. With other player counts, I would probably rate this game somewhere between 7 or 7.5.

The simultaneous action selection of Race for the Galaxy makes the ability to predict and take advantage of other players' actions and strategies very important. It's a subtle form of player interaction, but it's important enough to keep Race for the Galaxy from being simply multiplayer solitaire. Two-player advanced is my favorite way of playing the game, due to being able to choose two actions per turn. This greatly quickens the pace of the game, and the high number of action combinations greatly increases the strategy involved.

Similar to 7 Wonders in overarching game play mechanics, but with a much stronger strategy and luck of the draw aspect. With 7 Wonders, I find myself only having to think one or two turns ahead, while I find myself planning three to four turns again with RftG.

The luck component can be a little frustrating at times, severely hindering what you can and can't do, but I suspect much of this can be mitigated by better deck shuffling. Another thing to become accustomed to is the idea of discarding potentially great cards, especially when you're used to games with little or no discard mechanics.

This game took me by surprise. While I was initially irriated by the pasted on theme and the complexity of the interactions between the cards, I eventually broke down and gave it a try.

RATING: 7
Though generally not a fan of card based games, Race for the Galaxy intrigued me, with its space theme and also its claim to essentially be a less involved Puerto Rico; both of these promises convinced me to put aside my prejudices and pick it up.  As far as I'm concerned, it as more than lived up to both of these promises, and I've enjoyed the dozen and a half or so games I've gotten out of Race for the Galaxy so far.  While initially it seemed the game was unbalanced towards a military victory, after multiple playthroughs (and discarding the preset starting packages in favor of a random starting hand with each of the homeworlds), I've discovered using economic or Six-point card avenues to victory are just, if not more valid, and I feel I've just begun to scratch the surface of options and strategies.  The card tableau each player builds also acts as a decent replacement for a board, which makes the game more visually and practically agreeable for me as well.  One of my few major dislikes, is the underwhelming feeling of what is in the box, however: you only get a bunch of cards and some markers.  It is a great game nonetheless, but I did feel a bit disappointed and ripped off after paying for it and opening the box.

While I'd still rather play Puerto Rico more often than not, Race for the Galaxy has a unique vibe of its own, while also being significantly faster paced and easier to set up, earning its reputation as a great game in its own right.

It was my favorite game until a [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/124742/android-netrunner]certain[/url] cyberpunk LCG took the crown, but it keeps a very close second place. After literally thousands of plays, I still manage to find nuances in this deep game which can be played in five minutes online, or twenty face to face. I am convinced RftG is inexhaustible, even without a single expansion (but [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/34499/race-galaxy-gathering-storm]The Gathering Storm[/url] completes the game). It is difficult to find real life partners for regular play, specially after developing some expertise in the game, so I mostly play [url=http://en.boardgamearena.com/#!gamepanel?game=raceforthegalaxy]online[/url]. Nevertheless, this already is, and probably will always be, the single game I have played most in my life.

[b]Takes the best of Puerto Rico, broadens out the strategic possibilities, and shrinks gameplay to less than 30 minutes. Incredible game design. I do think this is a better (and quicker) game than Roll for the Galaxy as well.

[b]After 40 plays...[/b] I'm going to go as far as to say that, with one expansion, this is one of the best games ever designed. Right behind Agricola. I feel as though the more I play it, the better and deeper the game reveals itself to be. So many ways to approach getting your victory.

[b]After 10 plays...[/b]I traded it away a long time ago, and realized I'd made a mistake. One of the best euro cardgames of all time. Affordable, expandable, quick to play. Excellent stuff.

It took me about 6 months to convince my wife to try it, and now it is one of her favourite games.

The standard rules tend toward a game that is perfectly balanced and succinct.  Unfortunately, it's also a bit frustrating because you generally create a well-oiled point-producing machine just as the game ends.  The time limit allows greater diversity of strategy, and there are always variants for when you feel like a longer game.  The art is excellent.  The theme is well-done if a bit lacking in backstory.  It's a great card game and I can't wait to buy the expansion.

Played this with 4.  Smacks of both Puerto Rico and San Juan, the card game version of Puerto Rico.  I own all 3 and enjoy all three.  Even though the games resemble each other, they play so differently that I am happy to own all 3 and feel I have no redundancies.  Not bored with any of them.  
     I really like Race for the Galaxy and feel it is a solid game.  30 mins is an accurate and good length for the game.  Also enjoy the graphics.  
     I rated San Juan a 10 because I enjoy it and have played it reapeatedly a few hundred times without getting bored.  Initially I like this one better, and will bump it to a 10 if I feel it continues to play as well as its sibling.

Mmm.  A meatier San Juan in space.  What's not to like?  I think there might be some balance issues with the different strategies; specifically, my initial impression is that the military thread seems really powerful.

I will gladly play to verify if there is a problem.  I'm really liking this.

I don't care for this as it suffers from needing to know what a lot of the possible cards are.  Mix in a few expansions and the problems are compounded.

I like tableau builders, but maybe I don't like space themed ones.  Like Core Worlds, I don't feel like I'm 'building' anything.  I'm just playing a card to get more cards, to activate others, and couldn't care less about the theme.

I've played this game at least 10 times. It's a short game that ends up getting played a lot because it's short. There is a fairly high learning curve because of the dozens of symbols on the cards, and it took a pretty long time to be able to really understand what those symbols meant and to remember it for the next game. But once you get past that, it's fun and enjoyable.

Okay, I get it now.  I've done numerous solo (against the robot) and demo games now.  It's actually quite simple, once you get the icons down.  The robot, from the expansion, is a little difficult to operate without the rule book, for now.  I'm sure that will improve with multiple plays.

I've started to explain the basics of the cards and think I'm ready to teach a for-real game now.

So far, the game seems really cool.  Obvious strategies have not jumped out at me.  I've read the helpful strategy articles here but that much of the game I think will click only with more playing experience.

We played it twice as a couple now, and it was a good experience and know we will play it many more times.

Aug 2009.  - Been enjoying Solo mode with the first expansion.  It's a very addicting game, and difficult to beat.

Melissa and I are playing a lot of 2-player games now and it's starting to click and play quickly.  I can tell she's starting to get it because I rarely win anymore.  :)

Just added the 2nd expansion and I still really love playing this game.  The new start world rules from the 2nd expansion is a nice touch.

RATING: 10
Dense, deep game with a short playing time and low downtime (due to simultaneous turns), and varied and emergent strategies.

Interaction is limited to leeching, playing cards that influence opponent phase choices, claiming goals, forcing consumption, and ending the game. There is little resource denial and you can generally pursue your strategy without interference, though you'll benefit from watching, predicting and exploiting opponents' actions.

The game has been extensively playtested and balanced, and it shows in the multitude of synergistic plays that you can adapt on-the-fly. Every turn, you make hard decisions about which strategies you want to pursue and which opportunities you'll give up for others.

The space colonisation theme is very well integrated into the gameplay; note that military conflict is deliberately circumscribed to skirmishes. As you play, you can form mini-narratives of the fortunes of your galactic empires.

Duration: Fast and with simultaneous turns.
Design: Fantastically balanced, with lots of different potential strategies and styles of play. Interaction is indrect and limited, but you'll lose if you ignore it.
Strategy: You need to watch your opponents and guess their moves (but don't have to). You must be flexible with your strategies, and combine smaller pieces into larger ones.
Components: The art is great, coherent, follows the theme and cards sturdy. Icons are logical, but there are lots of them.
Theme: Nicely integrated into the cards.

This game was an instant favorite, and is my absolute favorite card game. It is very similar to San Juan, but with a sci-fi theme. I'm not a huge sci-fi game fan, but the theme doesn't deter me. If this game was about grass growing, it would still be fun. There is a great deal of depth of strategy, and a definite learning curve that is fun on the way up. I really like games that involve combining cards in multiple ways (i.e. to score points and to "power up" your civilization). To me, this is San Juan on steroids, since the 6 point developments (think "big buildings" from that game) are useful early in the game.

This game is a huge pile of card combos.  I guess I'm a card combo junkie....  At first the icons turned me off (big time) but I realized most of the information you needed was in text on the cards.  But even a haphazard first play made me pick up a copy.  I'm very interested in one deck, transportable card games that are deep and Race for the Galaxy has those elements.  Easy to set up and not as fiddly as San Juan.  This game gets better with plays and may well become a favorite.  Excellent, imaginative artwork and great production values as well.  Try it, it's worth learning!  I'm not a fan of space themes but it works great here-very creative.   Love the quick set up,  portability and the fact that it plays great with two.

Update:  Feels much bigger and solid that Dominion, which is good to me.  I still like Race and hope to play it more despite the crazy amount of icons!  To it's credit, Race feels like more of a board game than quick card game.

I actually like the icon system of RftG more than the text of San Juan. I like the theme and art better in RftG. I feel like I should love this game. So far it has been a disappointment.

It took 30 players for me to realize that I just don't like it. Everyone talks a lot about how much strategy, long term planning and fun is in this game. I just don't get it. I won more times out of luck than planning ahead. So many strategies are subject to a couple of specific cards and you generally have to "waste" all your turns just trying to find those cards only to have them drawn randomly by another player who doesn't need them but holds on to them for a little while because it's pretty obvious that you need it.
Basically you just get cards into your hand, buy the best one using less helpful cards. Repeat. I may sound jaded, but after 30 plays, I didn't see much else.

The art is amazing and the game is fast-paced and strategic. I love it. One of my favorite games, one I've had and loved since before I ever knew about the scope of the hobby.

Alien Artifacts nicely ties all the keywords together. The alien orb is a nice concept, but drags the game to a halt and is a parasitic mechanic. It should have been a separate game.

Well alright; it's a good game I'll give you that.  But I can't find too much to rave about.  I like it quite a bit but I'm afraid I have fallen victim to the hype.

Comparisons to San Juan do not do this game justice; most importantly because the role-selection does not work in the same (or even a similar) fashion, but also because of the way victory points are attained.

I think this game will improve with the expansion, which I intend to try just as soon as I can.  I expect more interaction out of the game with the expansion; right now there just isn't enough.

To me this game is very similar to San Juan and Glory to Rome.  Since this one is very symbol driven I think it is harder to learn and understand then the other 2.  It can play much faster and has some improved two-player rules comparatively.  The theme really feels tacked on, more so then the others.

A more complex game than San Juan, which is one of my favorites. The cards can take some time to get used to, but the player aid helps decipher the symbolism. Definitely a game I'd like to play more and get better at.

This is a lot of fun, and I'd give it at least a 9 except for two problems: First, it's too complicated for my non-gamer friends to really enjoy. Second, I find that to play this kind of game well I really have to get an intuitive feel for the card distribution, and expansions futz with that.

RATING: 7.5
Once you're over the barrier that the symbols on the cards create this is a fantastic tableau building game. And so fast with players familiar with the game. The dual use of cards as actions or currency creates some agonising decisions and you’re presented with lots of options and decisions each and every round. Great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The game clearly borrow a lot of elements from San Juan (and by extension, Puerto Rico). Still, it feels fresh and the various possible strategies all look like they can be played efficiently. One drawback is that cards can be used as "money" or as "buildings", so you are always reading them to decide which ones to keep and which ones to drop. Add to that the huge number of special actions and the somewhat obscure iconography and it makes the game feel heavier than it really is. Another downside is the especially low amount of player interaction, and that coming from someone who considers that both San Juan and Puerto Rico have a lot of interaction.

Rating went up. Somehow this game is growing on me!

SO MANY ways to get the victory.! SO MANY ways to combine your cards! Make your "hand" work properly is a constant challenge...
More tactical than strategical game, Race for the Galaxy (RftG) challenges you every turn: Every new game round will put you into a "limbo" in wich most choices will lead you thru uncertainty and, probably, to victory... ¡Feel the panic folks!
Most choices are difficult to be taken, because you never know exactly wich is the best option to take. 
One of my favourite aspects of RftG is that it's as deep as Puerto Rico, for example, but it's dynamic and fast paced! In addition, a game of RftG normally takes between 30 to 60 minutes and everybody plays simultaneously... So, you'll never feel boring!
What else can I say... I really love this "space exploration themed" game!

Kicsit nehezen állt össze, de számítottam is rá, mert hallottam már az ikonok nehézkes olvashatóságáról.
Viszont mikor kezdett összeállni, nagyon jó lett. Két játékkal még érezhetően nagyon az út elején járunk, és valószínűleg még csak sejtéseink lehetnek a játékban rejlő kombinációs mélységekről.
Így elsőre nem igazán volt energiánk figyelni a grafikákra, tematikára, de amit láttam az nagyon jópofa, hangulatos volt.
Egyetlen egy dolog nem állt teljesen össze: mintha kicsit hamar véget érne a játék. Pont mikor kezdene beindulni a gőzgép, már vége is. Így a military erősebbnek hatott a termeléseknél. 

Majd meglátjuk még. Mindenképp kell még játszani vele.

Jópár játék után már annyira nem a szívem csücske. Iszonyat nagy benne a szerencsefaktor. Egyetlen dolog, ami elviszi az a hangulat, mivel a kártyák neve és illusztrációja nagyon jó és nagyon tematikus.

Just got this, finally. My latest gamer pals play this all the time, seriously. I think their feeling is that a game night is not complete if they haven't played it at least once. I'm beginning to feel that way too, although I must admit that I'm not very good at the game. The number of choices available at any one time is pretty bewildering, and I have trouble narrowing down what I should do. I also have a vague suspicion that I make bad choices of which cards to keep and which to use for money. But then it also seems to me that the outcome of the game is highly dependent on who gets the cards they need.

*Update*
Lately, this is my favorite game. I'm really itching for the Rebel vs. Imperium expansion to come out. I love the fact that there are so many different paths to victory. Winning takes a lot of skill, but I do still think you also have to be lucky and get the right cards.

Even though the game shares so many traits with San Juan that it might be considered a mere rethemeing at first glance, Race offers quite a few more possibilities and is not as constrained (I'm sure the expansions help in this department, too).

The iconography is something that will slow new players down quite a bit in the first few plays but even after only one play I didn't feel like it's as big an issue as some people make it to be. An exceptionally fine game, even though it might take a while to grow to that level of appreciation.

First game of this I played (with someone else's copy)I didn't have a clue about the symbology because it had been poorly explained, but something about the game inspired me to buy it. Once I knew what I was doing, I fell in love with this game. There are different ways to win the game, but you still need to keep an eye on what your opponents are doing. The simultaneous declaration of actions keeps everyone guessing. I find this far more fun than Puerto Rico, and the expansions add depth and more choices. Highly recommended!

Iconography is a challenge when you are first learning the game.   With regular plays, the iconography eventually fades into the background, but it takes 10+ games. 

Best part of the game is the action selection and the  double-think trying to leverage your opponents action while getting the extra thing done that you want to do.  I played this quite a bit and it's not interactive enough for me to rank more highly.  I do appreciate the mechanisms.

A fun and addictive card game.  Normally I would dislike this kind of game because of the lack of direct player interaction, but it works for me in this game because it is relatively short.  The role selection mechanic works well here.  The learning curve can be steep in the beginning because of the symbol system, but after you learn it it actually makes the game easier to play.  I like the sci-fi theme (even if it is pasted on) and the art is attractive and interesting.  There is plenty of strategy to explore and I fell like I have just scratched the surface, especially with the expansions added in.

Have now played 100+ games - and 70+ of those were two player. I continue to find myself being sucked into this game. For the first time in a long time, I am studying strategies and cards and combinations. I believe this game allows for the development of more skillful play with additional experience. Few Euros seem to have this quality beyond the first 3-4 games. After that, there seems to be little room for continued skill development. Not so with RftG, apparently. I'm still learning subtleties and the use of the various cards - and can hardly wait for the expansion. In addition, we are developing a following of players in our gaming group. We now need two copies of the game to accommodate everyone, but they are out of print, so we will have to wait a bit.
Af 45 plays we began to see games ending very quickly in 2-player. We generally know by the 2nd or 3rd turn who will win (bad thing). Especially if one player has Tourist World placed and a couple of production worlds. He simply gets too many points per turn. In one of our recent games, I started with Earth's Lost Colony and managed to place Refugee World on the first turn (Novelty "0" cost windfall). But, my opponent played "Consume: Trade" and I traded Refugee World for 1 VP. On my second turn I dropped Tourist World and produced on both Refugee World and ELC. Turn 3 I Consumed X 2 & Produced for 6 VPs. On turn 4 my opponent Settled, allowing me to drop Space Port (Cost 2 Novelty world). I again Consumed X 2 for 6 VPs (now had 13) and Produced on all 3 worlds. On turn 4, I Consumed X 2 on all three using Tourist World for 6 VPs and ELC to consume the good on Space Port for another 2 = 8 VPs. I now had 21 VPs. Turn 5 was a repeat and ended the game. I had 29 VP chips plus 5 VPs on my 4 worlds = 33 points. My opponent didn't have a chance. We both knew by the 2nd turn that I had won, but we continued playing to see if there was anything he could do. He built twice every turn (was very lucky in setting down 2 Military worlds for free each turn and drawing enough cards from "Consume: Trade" to keep getting military worlds he could play! He had most of his points in his Tableau, but still only had 23 or so points. 
We have found the same problem with Global Trendsetters, though to a lesser degree. Since then we have played 2 player games without those two cards and they almost spell certain victory if placed early.

A good space empire game played with cards instead of a board. Problems: 1) little interaction with other players. This is mostly a horse race. 2) The designer made a bad choice by relying upon an arcane set of iconography instead of text. Undoubtedly done for language independence and effective once you learn the icons but it takes awhile to learn. 3) The game is too damn fast. I like the idea of a short space empire game but the 12 card tableau or 20 odd victory chit endings leave no time to develop strategies.

May seems to be a little hermetic at the begining. Then, after 2 or 3 plays, you can see the light: it's a great game about card combos, planification, rule selection, timing.

But anyway, I'm happy, and waiting eagerly to play this evening... Wow, wow, wow, wow.

I've never played a game where I vacillate so much on my rating. I really do think that having fun while playing RftG is very dependent on who you are playing it with and the long-range strategy that falls in your lap with your first number of draws. RftG is one of those games that is totally mind-numblingly boring when you are waiting for other people to play their turn. There is absolutely nothing to think about when you are waiting. Also unfortunate, some players can take a long time as they puzzle over their hand (when their hand is large) while players with small hands make quick and predictable moves. That kind of unbalance can be upsetting if players are not working at the same pace. Never have I played a game where it could be either exciting or a hell pit of dragging on. I still greatly admire the game for its mechanics and artwork.

played it, hated it. Thought I may like it in the future (as I like San Juan). Played it again, hated it. Thought it should grow on me eventually. Bought a copy, played it, hated still, traded it.
I tried, I really did, but It is just not for me.
*update, um 5 years later* 
Okay finally played it again, this time I did get it and quite easily. It does play very fast and there is a breadth in it's variability...but I think I prefer San Juan right now.

RATING: 10
One of my favorite games and one I've played probably hundreds of times against human and Keldon AI alike (heavily favoring AI, of course).  Multiple paths to victory.  Nearly perfect balance between the strategies.  The game allows you to strategize, but forces you to adapt as the game progresses.  Agonizing decisions regarding which cards to play and which to use as currency.  There is even a fertile meta-game to explore once you've got a grasp on the card strategies.

The only negatives I can see is that the learning curve for this game is STEEP due to the symbols and sheer number of different cards.  Yet these also become strengths after struggling through the initial plays, so...I guess they're not negatives at all.

Played Race for the galaxy for the first time today. Played with my girlfriend and we both enjoyed it alot. I watched a couple of introduction videos here on BGG before the game and got a good grip of the rules pretty quick. My gf had some difficulty understanding all the icons but within 1½ hour we had finished our first game. Lots of strategy still to be learned of course but the complains about the steep learningcurve was a bit overrated imo. As I said I've only tried it once so far but my first impression is that Rftg is a fun game with lots of depth yet still playable in 30 min with 2 players. It seems to work perfect for us, being parents to two small children, having trouble ever finding time to finish a game lasting more than an hour. Rating it an 8 after one game. 101226 Edit: Played two more games last night and am now rating it a 9. Maybe that says something? ;-)

Meh... the theme doesn't interest me. It was as good a game as I expected it to be and have heard it is.

Although it can be fun to choose a strategy and execute it, it's very frustrating to choose a strategy and then never again see a relevant card. It seems that the winner of the game is going to be the guy whose cards best match the strategy that he started with. I've won several games through no real fault of my own, and badly badly lost some where I knew exactly what I was doing. The players are very much at the mercy of the cards.

RATING: 8.5
Initial impression: The more I play this game the less I like it. Super random, you need to have a majority of the cards memorized to know what you're doing ... not fun. 
(Rating 6)

20+ games: After giving this game a chance I can see the appeal.  The randomness is still troublesome but there are some strategy aspects which can be interesting.  You really need to play this game 10+ times to get a feel for it.

100+ games: A fun, fast game.  Huge learning curve & a bit of luck, but definitely enjoyable -if you can slug through a ton of games.

I recommend only playing this game with the Gathering Storm Expansion.  Otherwise, there's only one viable path to victory - the military path is completely OP and the game is unbalanced.  Also, be prepared for some pretty intricate symbology.  That being said, the theme is strong and this is an interesting two player card game.

RATING: 5
Having not played this in a while, I look back with a much different attitude than I had at first play.  My first play and this was an 8, second through fourth it dropped slightly to a seven.  Race now stands where I believe it truly belongs at a 5.   I don't find that it vastly improves on San Juan, in fact I think all the icons and muted colors slow down and make game play more complex (and not in a good way).  There really is no interaction here, and the game is totally dependent on draw and not good play once a few games have been played and people understand what is going on.  It is a clean, and well designed machine but not worth the hoopla people have been singing.  There is definitely a target audience here, and they will love it, but I find myself much more in the mood to play something more substantial or interactive.  Fun doesn't come to mind when playing this, although it isn't a bad time - just "meh"  

Claims that this game has true depth astound me.  Yes there are multiple paths one can take but this is entirely dependent on initial and early card draws.  The fact that one can design a strategic plan and then never see any other card of relevance can easily mean they are dead from the out set.  The depth in game play here is easily having knowledge of the possible cards one might draw. The tactical elements are also more limited than have been given credit for.   As I stated before once players have a grasp then it is all about card draw, and Race for the Galaxy loses all of it's replay factor.

Fairly tough to initially pick up as the icons are quite confusing. Once you start to get them though it becomes a lot of fun. It definitely has a San Juan feel to it and I can see the influence. Players compete to build up technologies and settle worlds. They explore, produce goods, and consume those goods. Different cards give different powers in the different phases. This is where the confusion comes in. there are literally dozens and dozens of icons that you need to decipher to understand what powers you have. 

First to 12 cards or once the VP tokens runs out causes the game to end. players add VP from planets and developments as well as tokens earned with powers. High score wins.

RATING: 10
Also own: all 3 expansions.  All cards are sleeved and boxed in a special storage system.  We pimped this out with cubes and tracking dice to show you military capabilities. We also made extra chits to advertise takeover cards held.  I produced a full-color half-page sized booklet that integrates all the icon references.

Over 100 plays now... which is extraordinary for me for any game.  I can still see myself playing this one again and again.  There is a learning curve, but in our case we were understanding and reading all the symbols quickly by the end of the first game.

The expansions do what expansions should and give the game new life.  

The player aid is fantastic... but only for beginners.  After a few plays you don't need it any more.  A better aid would include info on the distribution of cards in the deck so you can make informed choices: e.g. "I wonder what the odds are of drawing another "Alien" card..."

Purchased at The Comic Hunter on April 20th, 2015

After playing Keldon AI for so long, I had to finally pick this up and play against real people. This game is fantastic - a thinky game that feels (to me) like equal parts strategy, tactics and luck. It's very easy to see where you made mistakes after losing and based on that, you've always got a way to look back and work on improving.

I really want to like this game, but I've only played it once and it was a little confusing. I don't know why I was confused but I'm sure I'll have a good grasp of the game after play number two.

Definitely one of the best 2-player game right now. Set in a futuristic space setting, the game places you as a civilization trying to expand its influence by way of culture, military, trade or technology.

A great game if you recognize what you're getting. After many, many 2p plays, I see it as a fantastic strategic filler game. Plays quickly, offers enough difficult decisions, and is truly a race. The nice artwork adds to it (even if you never get to admire it because of how the game plays).

Dislike it at 3p--too few actions going on.

OK at 4 and 5, where there are enough actions to go around.

This is a really deep little card game.  They sure do cram a lot of info on those cards.  The rules and iconography are difficult to grok and explaining this game to newcomers is a real pain.

I rate this down a notch from 7 because I feel a number of strategies aren't that viable (like a trade-centric game) while some others are very strong (like a military strategy), and hybrid strategies have no synergy.  Probably would play this instead of San Juan, though.  The expansions address these issues with cards to make certain strategies more practical and various awards for accomplishments.

Holy smokes...this game has so many options and possibilities.  Just the text on all the cards makes my head hurt.  It isn't that hard, but with so much going on with all the cards, it's easy to forget bonuses that certain cards provide.  I am definitely looking forward to playing this one a lot more.

I love worlds added by the first expansion...gives the game a lot more strategic depth.

An incredible game with an elegant system of symbols that may seem daunting at first. There are multiple winning strategies and just a dose of luck.

While there is randomness due to card drawing, a good strategy will beat a lucky draw almost every time.

Won at auction 1-14-08. Confusion of playing with 3 other players who are extremely proficient in the game made the game less enjoyable for me. When everyone else knows what the cards mean, what cards should be played together and you don't and you actually are still having a hard time understanding the symbols on the cards the learning curve is somewhat negatively affected. 5 plays did not do much to improve the situation. My rating reflects this. Hopefully playing the game with other newbies slowly with discussion about how and why cards are bring played will raise this games rating later on.

The game certainly has some interesting options and choices for players to make.  I see where the designer is going with building off the San Juan mechanics but going for something more challenging.  But I find the card clutter, myriad of options, and clunky phase mechanics to be far too much for me to overcome.  I know a lot of people love this game, but I just can't seem to get on board with it.  I've played twice, come in 2nd place both times, and thoroughly disliked it each time.

An "okay" game. It's basically puerto rico in space as a card game. I'm not overly keen on it because its basically multiplayer solitaire and also the card design is frankly....just bad. Cards have no text on at all and explain everything with an entire language built of symbols. This would be fine if the artwork (which takes up the whole card) was any good but its exceedingly dull. Would rather have had less of the card taken up with artwork and more of it reserved for text to better explain what the card does (e.g. DOMINION!!)

The iconography is such a barrier to entry for new players. Once you (and your play group) get it all down, it's a fun game with good replay value, but it's not one to just play a few times and mix in once in a while. Definitely not a game to introduce new gamers to very early.

This game is so great that I think I may have to go back and lower some of the games that I gave 10's. The first few games were confusing because I had to learn the icons, and I had no idea how to play well. Now that I understand the game I can't stop playing it. 

There are lots of strategies and choices.

At first I was a little nervous that learning all the icons might make the game way too confusing. This is not the case. Once the icons are learned, the game flows very smoothly. If I need to find out what bonuses I get for a specific round, I just scan my eyes across the icons, which is much more efficient than reading a block of text on each card.

This game is very, very well done. It's obvious that a ton of playtesting went into it.

While I'm afraid that the 1-2 game "learning curve" hurdle will eventually lead to some difficulty in introducing new players to the game, I am otherwise enthralled with this gem. It packs more game into 30-45 minutes than many 2-3 hour "classics". 

Take Chris Farrell's advice & don't show newbies the player aids until you've taught them the rules. As well, since the game is short enough, talk new players into agreeing to play twice (because the first game is mainly about learning the system.)

This is NOT, btw, "Sci-Fi San Juan" - I don't like San Juan, and this is quickly becoming a Top Ten game for me!

Excellent game. I find a lot of interaction in it, and I actually love the theme. My girlfriend also can't get enough of the game, which is a bit surprising.
It will take the first game for players to really understand what the heck is going on. But after that it has been clear sailing for my friends and I. This is one of my new top 10's.

UPDATE - This went down quite a bit for me. It just felt like, after a while, luck did a lot to determine the winner.

played once at a game night but didn't get to finish due to time constraints. I also didn't fully understand all the rules for my introductory game. There seems to be alot of them to ingest in a 10 to 15 minute overview. :) From what I can tell, it seems to be a really good game (ala, puerto rico with cards in space) but I'm 99% sure that my wife won't play it so unless I get it as a gift, there is not much likelyhood that I'll be picking this up until later on down the road after I've acquired some other games that will see the table time. 03-Jun-2009

*As you can see from my my number of plays I ended up getting it. It's a great game. I play it solo with the gathering storm expansion mostly. It's the best solo game I've played yet. I don't log solo plays here though.

The level of rules complication is incredibly big comparing to the idea behind the game. But once you grasp them the game flows smoothly and very fast. It's one the few games that combine such quick and tense gameplay with such a big amount of strategical and tactical thinking in such a brilliant way.

The only downside is that in spite of the short playing time you can't play it with non-gamers - it's definitely a gamers' game.

After playing the game solo with the solitaire rules found in the first expansion I've learned to appreciate it much more. I think I played the game originally in a too hasty environment, with too many players to enjoy it.

Superb amped-up version of San Juan.  Excellent artwork, the cards have been carefully themed, icons make it a breeze to learn, and in play it seems wonderfully balanced.  Interesting varying the game length - tableaus of 15 cards/18VP per player 2p games works, but the result is probably the same as if you stopped at 12/12 so they have got it pretty spot on - it is a "Race" after all.  My most played game in past 15 years - in only 6 months.  Highly recommended.  Expansions add interest, but RvI and BoW seem to over-complicate things.  Have had fun with AA and XI, but original + GS is probably my favourite.

Galaxy, it's what ya race for.  

So yes, this is a daunting game to grasp.  It does help if you have played San Juan before, but even so there is a lot of interactions with the cards and there are more cards and a lot of iconography.  After one game it begins to come together and you can see the potential in this game.  It's the type of game that I think can be quite rewarding and it plays quickly.  It scratches the CCG itch without feeling like a CCG.

On the whole, pretty impressive.

There was a point where I really doubted this game, but it latched on to my brain like no other card game. The art is mostly great. I'm a sucker for sci-fi games.

It took a few games for the iconography to set in...which makes it difficult to teach instantly to others. The base game is mostly solitaire, but you can force people in to spending their cards before the action they picked comes up. (ie screwage!)

It's amazingly balanced however, and I keep coming back to it. It's my goal to get everyone I know to learn this game to expand my pool of opponents!

Update: I've had to lower my rating a bit on this. While I still like it, it's flopped with multiple groups I've tried it with. I have to admit that it's just not intuitive enough to learn/evoke the theme as many other games that have come out since it was released. San Juan seems much easier to grasp, and even something such as Manhattan Project, which at its core is still an 'engine builder', despite being worker placement. Sorry Race, there are other games that dish out a similar feeling that will get played more regularly.

Everything "they" say about the symbols on the cards is true. There are many and their meaning is not obvious so it must be learned and perhaps relearned if it's too long between games. After the learning curve, it's a great game with little direct conflict but with rewards for second guessing opponents' actions.

This game is like crack to me, it plays incredibly fast but gives me the same feeling of satisfaction as Dominion.  Biggest gripe is that there really are only a couple consistently viable strategies in the base set, and unless you get a dream hand, genes are pretty worthless.  Also, without expansions, if you get a bad hand it doesn't matter how good you are, you're still going to lose.

RATING: 10
So far my only 10 rated game, even though it has only seen a few plays. I absolutely love the strategy/tactics surrounding this game, and think everyone should own it. A bit hard to explain to some, but oddly enough I understood the game after the first solitaire run-through, and a friend understood the game after his first run through as well. Scales really well from 2-4 players, no downtime at all it seems, and a quick game that packs a lot of interesting decisions into a short timeframe. Until I get to playing this a lot more, I don't see anything I really dislike about it at all. 

Some people compare this to Dominion in terms of likeability (I guess both are short, simple but complex card games for 2-4 players), and I would favor this way over Dominion.

Cardgame where you start off with a homeworld and some starting resources, choose the direction you want to develop your empire, and then build it up into something unique and impressive. 

* Every card in your hand can either be seen as something to buy and put on the table in front of you (in your tableau), or as currency that you use in order to pay for your purchases. Much of the enjoyment in the game can be derived from the angst of throwing away cool cards in order to buy another cool card. 

* Cards that are in your tableu give you special powers that can be used for the rest of the game. There are numerous different powers, but generally they either increase your ability to buy more and better cards, or give you the ability to convert cards into victory points. Acquiring special powers is always nice, and there is much satisfaction to be had in finding synergistic combinations of cards that make your empire powerful in some way.

* The game ends either when someone has bought their twelfth card, or when the pool of victory points (12VP per player) has been depleted. This means that the pacing of the game is in the hands of the players, and you should strive to end the game when you feel that it is beneficial to your empire.

Thematically it is very much in the spirit of 4X scifi strategy games, which are usually long drawn out affairs regardless of if you are thinking about galactic civilization or twilight imperium. In order to fit much of this experience into a 60 minute card game, race for the galaxy employs a fairly short game timer and simultaneous action selection.
Mechanically, it is the card version of puerto rico but with your building options randomly determined by what cards you draw. To offset this randomness there are many more viable strategies than in puerto rico so your hand of cards is rarely completely useless. 
If you use your imagination to fill in the blanks, you can definitely see your empire researching cool technologies, trading with different cultures and invading alien worlds. But the game mechanics, together with the use of abstract icons instead of flavor text on the cards, definitely makes this game more of an optimization puzzle with random elements rather than an epic space empire game.
                                   
Just like in Puerto Rico, the main player interaction comes from correctly predicting what the other players want to do and capitalize on their choices. Because of the simultaneous action selection and some changes in how the resources are handled, there is even less chance of directly interfering with another player compared to Puerto Rico. In other words, avoid if you are concerned about a multiplayer solitaire feel in your games.

The biggest negative for me is that the game has a steep learning curve. It takes a few games before you internalize all the icons and the general flow of the game. Then you need to get really familiar with all the cards in the deck in order to find viable strategies and to be able to play competently. I would say that you need at least five games, preferably in a short span of time, to get a feel for what the game has to offer. Before that, the game will feel opaque and random, and many players will not find this initial experience fun enough to get past the hurdle of learning to play. Once past this hurdle though, there is much enjoyment to be had in exploring different ways to grow your empire and, including solo plays, I've now played it hundreds of times.

I prefer to play the advanced 2 player game. You play as many role cards as with 4 players, so the game flows better than in the 3-player game or the regular 2-player game. It is also less work keeping track of one opponent than three opponents, thereby making it easier to predict how the game will unfold.

Rating is for when playing with the expansions included. I would not recommend using any expansions while learning the game, but they do open up for more flexibility and interesting new strategies, thereby making it a much better game.

My favourite card game up to date is an excellent two to six players game that takes its roots from Puerto Rico/San Juan and offers a lot of tactical choices packed in a short playing time (under the hour for two players, a little bit more with three and four). My only grip are the expansions, sure they give more possibilities like the take overs and prestige, but I dont think the takeover mechanics are well implemented, since they add a lot of housekeeping to the game and I see them as a flawed try to add interaction to this game. Otherwise, this is fantastic game that is way more easy to understand than it seems to be at first glance: just dont be afraid of these symbols, they really make sense after a couple of games.

April 2008, ConVic 7 - first play.  Good game (took about 1 hour with 2 new players, I've been told that with experienced players it becomes a 15 minute filler).   Theme is much better than San Juan and there was a lot of interaction between your cards and 'guessing' what the opponant will pick.  Solid 7/10 with forecasted 8/10 with some more plays (probably the game from the Con I am most likely to purchase).  Also expansions are due soon.

We've only played this with two, so I'm curious as to how it plays with more.

The core game mechanic of only resolving phases selected by at least one player (where every player can participate in the selected phases, but gains a bonus during the phase they selected before the turn) means you don't always have a chance to do everything, but are still sometimes helped by the choices of other players. A very interesting game mechanic.

Muy bueno. Tiene todo lo que debe tener un juego de cartas. Las únicas pegas es que al tratar de que no sea tan dependiente del idioma, el sistema de iconos y símbolos se hace un poco complicado de entender para los iniciados o para la primera partida, en la cual estás totalmente perdido. Otra pega es que conocerse el mazo y las posibles combinaciones de cartas da mucha ventaja a los jugadores expertos, que da sentido al uso del "explore +5" para buscarse los combos que un jugador inicial no sabe que existen. Por lo demás, genial. Muy adictivo y con mucha tensión, ya que la presión de los oponentes para cerrar la partida te impide conseguir los combos con la facilidad que te gustaría. 
En una mesa de jugadores expertos, es una pasada de juego.

RATING: 7
As a newbie to this game, this is way too complicated.  There are so many different rules and possibilities that a viable strategy is just not possible until you have played it a lot.  Working out how to get your economy going is a major headache.  It may have some merit, though, since it's overall feel is like a slightly more complicated version of the two-player Starship Catan which does play quite well.  I'll probably have to play this quite a few more times, which I just don't want to do, to get a fuller appreciation for this.  My initial gut feel after playing it half a dozen times is that it's just far too complicated for what is meant to be a short game.  There are plenty of games around which play well by the second or third try.  This is not one of them.  My opinion may change as I gradually get forced to play this more, but I doubt it...
...Okay, weeks later I am finally starting to understand some of the game mechanics here and have upgraded my opinion slightly from a 6 to a 7 rating.  However, a game that takes so much time and number of plays to make sense should sensibly be avoided unless you have a lot of patience.  At the time of writing this comment, I have played this game 22 times.

Simple but deep euro with engine building and some bluffing. The phase system works really well and is one of my favourite mechanics in any game. The cards as currency is a great conceit and makes the whole game feel very smart and streamlined. A lot of people complain about iconography, but I think that's exaggerated.

Adding a comment about differences from Race:
[q="GeorgW"]I'll chime in on the differences between Race and Roll. 

Race plays quicker (perhaps due to my group being more familiar with Race) and has a lot more strategy. While on the surface you make the same kind of choices in both games, such as which planets and developments to go for and which phase to choose, the dice in Roll screw up a lot of the depth in these choices that are still present in Race. 

For example when choosing a planet/development. At any given time in Race you have a hand of around 5 cards. This will of course vary, but in previous turns you've probably also chosen to discard cards that you've deemed to be worse than the cards you kept, so you throughout the game you generally have pretty good control of the cards in your hand. This means that if you play the game well and have reasonable luck, you'll usually be able to find planets and developments that have synergy and will help you win the game. In Roll, maybe you rolled 3 eyes so you looked at 3 tiles and chose 1. Maybe that tile is good for you, maybe not. That's the biggest flaw in Roll to me, because it almost eliminates the engine/tableau building aspect of the game.

A second example is picking which phase you want. In Race, that's a tense choice every turn where you're trying to predict what your opponents will do and balancing choosing something that's better for you or worse for your opponents. It's basically the entirety of Race's player interaction, but it's amazing. In roll, sometimes you roll 5 develops, so you choose develop. The randomness makes the prediction more difficult which in turn ruins the entire point of the mechanic.

With that said, there's still some stuff that Roll does better. It's a much newer game and as such has streamlined the rules a bit and is more colourful. It's also switched the phase sequence in order to make things move a little faster and allow for more explosive turns. 

As a summary, Race is the better game for me, but if you're new to both I'd recommend playing Roll first a few times until you're used to the iconography and flow of the game, then buy Race and never look back.[/q]

Maybe one of my favorites. Played countless plays now (mostly against Keldon's excellent AI admittedly) and I feel still intrigued by all the strategies that present themselves. 

My only caveat with it is beginner-friendliness or rather, the lack of such a thing. The gameplay is un-recognisable (if you haven't played Puerto Rico, San Juan or other multi-phase selection game) and the symbols can be a bit much for a beginner. If my GF would play it with me I suspect I could rate it a perfect 10.

Edit: And it happened! This is now a PERFECT GAME! My GF was willing to give it a second chance and she weren't disappointed!

The game is the typical "here are the rules, and most of the cards break the rules", except they don't break it so much as augment your strengths in each rule area. The icons help a great deal, but it STILL takes a while to get use to some of the interplay. 

Puerto Rico / San Juan players need to watch out that they assume too much to be in common. For example, in my first game, I just "consumed" all my production without a care for consuming worlds. In my mind it was a "Captain" phase, and I sent EVERYTHING to the ships. OOOOOPs. 20 VP tooo many!

I am now teaching my 11 year old son, and he's looking forward to playing. He understands the various phases, thanks to PC games like Age of Empires, so now it'll just be shoing him the mechanics and "there's no computer to do your accounting for you!"

My opinion of this game will likely move 1-1.5 points from where it is now but the criticisms of multiplayer solitaire are right on the money with this one. The playing time is short (largely because there is almost no interaction whatsoever) and I didn't get that "we played for twenty minutes but it seems like we played an epic game" feel at all.  I can't think of a reason yet anyone would really think that. Not an awful game, but not a great game. This one seems to be far too high on the ratings chart IMO.

Ok dropping a half point with more play. Anyone who tells you this is not multiplayer solitaire is just kidding themselves. The game is completely about optimising the cards in your hand and nothing else. The player that can play their hands the best will always win, regardless of what the other players do. I'm sure I'll have to play this more and the rating will keep dropping. Just a dreadful game that would be so good if there was some REAL interaction not the dreamt up indirect hooey that people try to say exists. For a solo game all you have to do is to randomly pick two cards from another color's hand and give the opponent some progressively increasing number of victory points per turn. Then you can pretend that there is another player there and the results will be the same.

I like it, and enjoy it every time I play it, but I do get frustrated when I feel like I'm just getting something going, and the game ends.  It is a race, and that's the most important thing to remember in this game.

A deeply strategic card game based on similar mechanics to San Juan/Puerto Rico.

I also find that the iconography, despite the problems it causes for many people, is very helpful in allowing one to easily scan the cards for information.

Race for the Galaxy is the sort of game I can sit down and play over and over for as long as time allows. It's light enough that there's no fatigue factor, heavy enough that it stays challenging for play upon play upon play, random enough that each game has a very different contour, skillful enough that there's always more to learn.

If you didn't like San Juan, don't assume that you won't like Race for the Galaxy.  Yes, the two games both began as attempts to design the card game version of Puerto Rico.  San Juan holds no interest for me, but Race for the Galaxy is so far superior that it stretches the comparison to the breaking point.

It just feels like I'm playing solitaire across from someone else playing solitaire. That was okay for a long time because the cards and combos were interesting but maybe I've played too much because I feel like I've done them all. All in all a good game.

I was thinking Core Worlds might Jones-theory this one out of my collection, but this game is compelling enough to survive the deepest of cullings. 
It's a bear to teach, as the iconography can leave newbies' heads swimming. But after a few rounds, it all comes together. Worth the effort. Don't mess with the expansions - they add next to nothing.

One of the best games I have ever played. I have ordered the first expansion to play also as a solitary game. The first game was hard, because the symbols are a bit difficult to apprehend, but the second game went ok. You are building a galaxy empire with a bunch of cards and it works so well..it is amazing. We preferred it to Roll for the galaxy. Roll for the galaxy is good, but one finishes to play completely alone , at half of the game we realised we were not anymore at the same round and we had lost the count. What's more we had some doubts about the replayability of Roll for the galaxy on long term.

Received for Christmas 12/24/08. (On order at Christmas. Arrived 12/29/08.)

After playing Glory to Rome, I had to drop this one a notch. They're similar in many ways (as is San Juan), but Glory to Rome is much easier to play, is more fun, and has at least as much depth to explore.

Gave to Blake as a welcome to Colorado gift.

This one finally clicked, but it took playing Roll for the Galaxy to begin to get it. I think I played 10-15 games of this against human opponents before recognizing the brilliance here. Now I think I prefer it to the dice counterpart (although Roll is also a great game).

UPDATE: Yes, since rediscovering Race, and especially since the app and Jump Drive have been released, I've almost forsaken Roll completely in favor of Race. It's so good.

This game is great.  It took a while for my wife and I to get the rules down and to decipher the icons, but once we did we found that this game was fun.  The game is deep and we've found many different engines that have worked (or didn't work) for us.

We're considering getting an expansion for the game and would appreciate any recommendations you may have.

10 plays in its first week shows that Race is one of the most successful games I have acquired in some time. I like the complexity involved MUCH MORE than San Juan. The simultaneous role selection works well. 

While the combos are much more powerful than those in Dominion, I am afraid that the deck size (which is cycled through once a game) limits the variability of this game. Interesting to see where it falls in 40-50 plays, which I am sure it will get.

At first I was a bit daunted by the complexity of this game, but once you get it, it is quite simple to grasp. I like the look of this game with the nice space theme and some really cool pictures. People have complained about the iconography, but I don’t see the icons themselves to be the problem, but the complexness of the game itself.

I prefer to play with the advanced game with two players, but I will play with any amount of players (although I prefer it with 2-4 players). It’s definitely a game that gets better with repeated plays. I play this extensively on Keldon's computer version.

I just don't like games like this. I dislike card games with a ton of iconography on them, but even when you learn what the icons do, abilities on other cards modify/intensify the original ability so you have to keep track of everything going on in front of you as well as everything your opponents are doing. That's too much accounting for me. I'll play it if asked because I don't dislike the game, but I won't seek out a play.

Two plays with four. Not my type of game--players are off in their own worlds, and if you want to see what other people are up to you have to squint across the table and decipher a bunch of visually cluttered cards. Both times I played this game I got a headache. That said, I'm not completely against playing it if other people are into it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The learning curve is steep but once you really learn the game, and evolve past struggling with how things work and what all the little symbols mean, this emerges as an uncommonly deep game with a surprising degree of theme. The problem is that it will take several dozen plays to arrive at this level of comfort (hint: play against the computer AI). Has evolved over time into one of my favorite games, it is a rare thing for me that a game has gotten so much stronger over time. I think the game is just about perfect for what it is ... about the only drawbacks are that games too often turn on the 6-factor developments that come into your hand, and military takeovers are underdeveloped.

Race for the Galaxy plays well with any number of player.  In this game there's a bit of luck but there's a LOT of strategy.  You will need a couple of play before you really appreciate it.  Once you know the cards in the deck this game is very good!

I have played a lot of game with the wonderful Keldon Jones AI.  This is a great way to learn the game but don't excpect to win many game.  That AI is tough to beat!  I must have played over 300 times and I often need to play many games before winning one.

You have to get used to those pictograms. While you get into the simples ones soon, some 6-costs developments are hard to understand. Is this the game itself? 
I felt that the game ends just when it gets going (12 cards played finishes the game) Maybe 15 would be a good alternative, but then also overview and bookkeeping will become more demanding. As for interaction with other players, the action selection should do so, but most of the time you can't figure out what others want to do because you can't read their cards so you mostly play what's good for you. Still a Multiplayer-Solitaire with lots of chaos. Nice with its space theme but I am not that happy with the game myself. Newbies wil always take the "Explore" card with which they can keep one more card, pros will use the other "Explore" card with which the can look at five additional cards, so the can pick the one that suits their strategy they set up at the beginning of the game. So, during the game you just execute the strategy. There are no gamey options to make it interesting. Experienced gamers will just look for the combo they know/like. Just browsing through a pile of cards until you get what you want is a poor game. No interest in playing ever again. When playing with role cards then I prefer San Juan or Glory to Rome anytime.

One of the best Space battle themed games. The universe is very weel developped with various people classes, places, etc.
The mechanic of RFTG is proved, but the profusion of symbols on some cards may do some players giving up in the earliers plays. Also, I think a good choice of the starting world and a good choice of cards too keep / too discard in the first turns of the play is primordial for the rest of this one.

Played 2+ with 3&4 players. I am pre disposed to disliking this game because of the complex looking play aids and because there are loads of cards with text and small icons on them.

This game is fantastic, the strategy and depth available in the box are hard to beat. It is currently my favorite game due to the strategic complexity and variable setups that force you to make changes on the fly. And all of this in 30 minutes or less. The only negative is that it is quite a challenge to teach due to the large number of icons on the cards.

Excellent game and I like the sci-fi theme, although I think I am a bit Raced out after spending the greater part of the year playing Keldon's AI.  Lots of interesting decisions to make, especially in trying to predict what phases your opponent(s) will choose and whether you will piggyback on the other chosen phases.  In-hand cards as currency is a very clever way of forcing you to make critical decisions on what to trash and what to keep.  It's very tempting to want to do it all, but almost every time I do this, I end up losing.

A bit heavy as far as rules and strategy/tactics, so unfortunately my in-laws (my usual gaming group, plus my wife) did not take to this game very well and has only had one play with them.

Fast played, but with deep tactical decisions. Some blame the fact that the game is hard to grasp at the beginning on the iconography, which I think is great. However, all the different cards can be a bit overwhelming at first. I think it also adds to the replayability of the game, which is high.

Single play rating of a 7. This was based upon the potential of the game and admittedly a little hype.

I have now played 5 games and the rating just keeps slipping, even though I have won 3 of the 5 I played.

For a game with "lots of cards" "tons of choices" "multiple paths to victory" "uber amounts of depth".....blah blah blah....it sure seems that I really only have one "good" option every single turn and that the person that can recognize this good option more often will win.

Sure, this can be applied to lots of games...even to some I probably like, however, not when the game is touted for its "depth of play" and "meaningful decision making".

I will say that the game seems to be very well balanced and playtested....just not fun.

I hated this when Dominion was the only game I played. It seemed like you had to memorize the deck to get anywhere, and the produce/trade thing just felt clunky.

And so I spent years hating this and seeing no reason to go back to it. But as I write this comment, I just played several quick games on BGA out of curiosity and... kind of liked it? Cautiously optimistic. The produce/trade business still actively bores me every time I try to think about it. 

I guess I've finally realized that some themes are a negative for me, not just a neutral thing to ignore.

Well. Let's see how this goes. I got heavily into Innovation with a similar arc (hated early games, avoided it for years, dabbled when I saw I could play online, now I like it a whole lot). There's still something janky about both games. They're not so much acquired tastes as... it's like eating mussels. There's work to enjoy it, and the work isn't fun on its own or a joyous rite of passage. It's just this stupid thing that's nevertheless worth doing if you like mussels.

I think. I mean, I don't like mussels.

Interesting play throughout the game, forces you to be adaptable and constantly critical of the path you're taking, not a game you could play on autopilot. I still hate trying to teach it, and a number of my friends just don't want to bother still. That being said the game is deep, card based, and well-timed; these traits combined make for a game I like quite a lot.

7 --> 8 Yeah I really made a mistake rushing the rating.
4 --> 7 For now

[-]I've made a mistake, played this 1v1 finally and started to "get" it. I've got a ways to go yet but I intend to play much more of this. (Only 1v1 though, god forbid I have to try and teach it to someone else)[/-]

Heard a lot of good things about this game and bought the whole set.  Sleeved them all too.  I've played the basic game with gathering storm thrown in, but I can't find anyone else to play it with and I haven't been that impressed with it the couple of times I have gotten to play it.  I don't mind the complex iconography, but I wish the game had more direct interaction between the players.  I like games with direct conflict, or at least a good strong mechanism for indirect interactions.  This game seems best suited to players who don't liked to be messed with.  The name is a very apt description.  It really does feel like a race to be the one to finish first.  I won't get many opportunities to play it again either since several of the people I play with are color blind and the game is impossible to play for a color blind person.

This is a good game. You build your galactic empire by playing cards from your hand to the table. Each round you select one of 5 actions to perform, which either let you play cards or draw new ones. It's a race for victory points with nice gameplay: no downtime, minimal shuffling, and plays in just over 30 minutes. It's not a deckbuilding game, it's more like San Juan than anything else. This might be too complicated for kids, but it should appeal to anyone over about 12 years old.

Simply put, it's a more complicated San Juan. The gameplay will be familiar to anyone who knows San Juan, yet there are more variables to think about and more complex card and player interactions. Very enjoyable. I can see how it would be ripe for expansions. *UPDATE* Played again. I still like it, but less. I think it might be too complex for its own good. There's too much of a "knowing the cards" curve for new players. I think I prefer the (relative) simplicity of San Juan.

Hands down, the best card game I've ever played.  The learning curve is a little rough and for many just understanding the mechanics can be tough to wrap your head around. Though the game only gets better as your knowledge about all the different cards increases, it is really worth the effort because it's just that good.

I rated this a 9 after just 1 play... based on the fact that enjoyed it so much more than San Juan (which is still a good game). Since then I have revised it up to a 10 to reflect how much I love this game.

I play mostly 2-player with my brother, but have played a number of times with 3 and 4 players as well (and a few 5 player games with the 1st expansion). The 2-player game has a slightly different feel, and I always miss playing 2 action cards when playing with 3 or more players.

Good game, very strategic but very clunky.  Would be rated higher if the base set were bundled with the first expansion, which greatly increases the tension and re-balances a few strategies.  Without the goal system, the game can feel a bit flat.

I've come to learn how aptly named this game is. At least in the base game and plays so far, it's all about getting to 12 cards first. Playing with just the base set gets old if not adding on the expansions. We always play with The Gathering Storm expansion, but not yet the other ones. The iconography is the biggest hurdle for learning, and then remembering if you only play sparingly.

This has been popular among various groups in my gaming days. My brother and I can pick it up and play a couple quick games without dedicating a whole evening to it. I like the feeling of "well I gotta work with what I got" every game. The solitaire variant is enjoyable and it actually teaches you a lot of lessons which develop you into a better player. A big stack of cards and endless possible combinations/strategies to reel in those VP's! The space theme adds to the fun.

As a lite game, the complexity was somewhat high and difficult to teach.  The symobology of the cards is great IF you play several games to figure it out - those first few games are a lost cause.  Once this is learned, it is a good game, but the subtle player interaction is a bit dry with comparison to my favorite euros (Power Grid, End of the Triumvirate, and Formula De).  So, the lite crowd is a bit overwhelmed, and the wargamer crowd is just not engaged enough for it to be more than filler.  I'd play if someone was interested, but would generally suggest something else.

Traded away.

With the new AI for it, number of play is easily over 500.

Awesome.  Just really awesome.  It straddles the line between deep and robust, and quick filler.  The way role selection works is unique, and makes for a cool bluffing/guessing component in heated games, but can also be played causally and you can still have a chance of victory.

I love this game, and have played countless times against the computer AI, winning all of like 5% of the time. But, I keep coming back for more punishment. Something about the strategy just keeps bringing me back. Very fun to play with people that know the rules. Can be frustrating for people to learn, as it takes at least 3 - 5 plays before you really start to grasp the concept. Needs another half a dozen plays before you know what cards to look for in the deck.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I really like the Sci-Fi theme and it is reasonably well implemented. However, there is so much to pay attention to, that I barely notice the theme. Although the game provides a plethora of possible strategies and card combinations, my impression after half a dozen plays is that one or two simple strategies are dominant (consuming and military). Also, I think it is one of those games where a player does better if he follows a specific strategy from start, in opposition to flexibility and mixed strategies. Besides, it certainly rewards knowledge of the deck - and there is a lot to know. I admit I would rate it lower if it had a more mundane theme and/or poor artwork, and I would probably have given up after the first play.

Not enough player interaction to hold my interest.  Fan boys who claim that there *is* player interaction are deluding themselves.  Reading someone's tableau and counting the number of cards they have in their hand is *not* player interaction.  If you don't mind no player interaction that's fine, but please call a spade a spade.

And even if you do pay close attention to your opponent, strategies are constrained by luck of the draw, so you can't react strategically to your opponent's tableau.  I imagine playing the card-drafting variant could improve this aspect of the game.

A boring, lonely chore.  Works better as a computer game, and I'll play against the Keldon AI occasionally.

After my first game, I was terribly disappointed...game, what game?  A struggle with the iconography saw me buy the game, determined not to let them get the better of me.  A handful of games later and the icons make perfect sense and I find the game to be a thrill ride.  This game packs so much punch into 30 minutes that it should be illegal.  Surely one of the best games to come out of late 2007.  Re-playability is right up there because I'm determined to better my previous score.  Very clever Mr Lehmann, very clever indeed!

So deep. While I may not necessarily want to play all the time anymore, this is my favourite game.

RFTG is amazing partly because of its short playtime. Nothing else comes close to it in terms of depth-to-time ratio. It's so intense!! Incredible blend of luck and strategy. 

As 'Fried Egg' pointed out in his review, RFTG is an economic game: opportunity cost, supply/demand, trade [and a healthy dose of militarism.]

(I think the best way to teach is by explaining the phases in reverse order, though I haven't taught the game many times at all.) 

Play count doesn't include Keldon's AI.

A filler game with some meat. It has a lot of potential. The cards help tell a story so there is definite theme here.

The biggest drawback is player interaction. You cannot disrupt your opponent's progress by attacking him. It's as if this "race for the galaxy" was taking place in several parallel universes. 

If you can come up with some house rules to deal with this, the game would be an 8 or 9.

A game that you can play very often especially with two people.

You should definitely buy the first expansion pack.

Instead of doubling the victory points (VPx2) in the consumption phase, you should apply the formula: (VP-1)x2 to better balance the game.

The game deserves a 10 alone for the sheer number of gameplays which are at least well beyond 100 (I didn't exactly count).

I think my play numbers for this and the first expansion speak more than I can, but let's try... Most of my friends keep saying that you just do your own thing and the game plays itself. That's exactly why they lose to me 9 times out of 10. :) Icons will baffle everyone the first game, but they should make perfect sense soon. Being a UI designer, I really appreciate how consistent the iconography actually is. Once learned, you will instantly understand even new stuff from the expansions, or at least guess close enough. This is also one of those games, where you think that you know all worth knowing about it, just to suddenly receive a revelation and step up a level to find out how much you've missed before. But it's still really enjoyable to play even before "leveling up", which is essential for getting the game to the table at all.

Our second most-played game after Thunderstone. Hugely enjoyable with 2-player advanced. It's a Lays potato chip game: you can't play just one. By itself I would give the game an 8; military is weak and occasionally frustrating. The Gathering Storm and Rebel vs Imperium correct this problem by adding new rules, new victory conditions and tons of new cards. Only complaint is the size of the deck after 2 expansions.

I love san juan but expected not to like this.  Heavier san juan with tons of bad iconography?  No thank you!  I successfully avoided it for almost five years after its release.

Well that was a mistake.  The iconography is actually very logical and I had no trouble picking up on it at all.  It is a little bit solitaire like a lot of the puerto-rico-style games but the role selection timing gives just enough interaction to be interesting.

Plus the fun of the game is in building a victory point engine through your tableau and trying to extend the game or end the game depending on your table position.  

After playing a few recent games that people compared to this (eminent domain) I have to say that Race for the Galaxy is the best of the bunch.  Nice fast game.

My wife and I really enjoy this game. Once you know the mechanics (a couple of playthroughs) it is a nice light game that can be finished in 30 minutes.

This is an initial impression based on one play. The symbols are somewhat confusing at first, to be sure. I think my CCG background helps here, but this could be a bit daunting for new players. I really like games where you can draw a lot of cards and cycle through them very quickly, and this game does that more than most others I have played. It seems like there are multiple ways to get a good score, which is encouraging, but it still seems a bit too chancey for something with the complexity of Puerto Rico. Even so, this is a very fun game with a theme I really enjoy as well. Rating could easily change based on more plays.

Very preliminary rating after first play.  It seems to have even less interaction than San Juan.  I'll have to play it 2-player to really judge that.  Another worry with the game is the seemingly steep learning curve to understand all the card combos.  *** Update.  Changed from 7 to 8 after 5-6 more plays.  I'm anxious to see how the player interaction develops as we get more familiar with the game.  *** Update. Changed from 8 to 9 after 5-6 further plays.

Obviously, this game shares a lot of the same mechanics as San Juan.  However, there are many important differences:

- A player can develop a technology and settle a world in the same turn, which means that they can add 2 cards to their tableau each turn, which makes for a shorter game (since the game ends when there are 12 cards in a player's tableau, much like the 12 buildings limit in San Juan).  With players who know what they're doing, this game takes 10-20 minutes.
- Each player turn can consist of less actions than there are players, if two players choose the same role.

- If you happen to draw a killer combination of cards early in the game, you could walk to an easy victory.

- There are not 4 copies of every card in the deck -- there are a large number of different unique cards, so the chances that you'll draw the card that you want (or a killer combo with what you have already) is lower.  My point is that random good luck often cannot be overcome by strategy in this game.  The only strategy to overcome bad luck is to lose quickly and play the game again!  (Well, you could also spend time choosing the Explore +5 action, which allows you to draw 7 and keep 1, and hope that other players will pick actions that work with your cards.)  This is very different from San Juan, where no great starting hand will give the game outright to a particular player.  Basically, I feel satisfied after playing San Juan, because my good play can keep the game close with a player who has a good starting hand.

After many plays, I kinda like this game, but it took quite a while for me to learn enough of the cards to understand what strategies were even possible, and even now, I lose very often.

Even more than in San Juan, where you really want to build a second production building as soon as possible so you can trade (especially silver, coffee, or even tobacco), in this game you need to get a production world up and running so you can get a bunch of cards from "consume with trade".  The mistake that I keep making is holding on to big (4- or 5-point) cards and planning to build them 3 turns later, which is way too slow.  I should ditch them early in favour of settling small 2-point worlds (especially green worlds) that can give me something to trade away for cards.  The odds are good that someone will try to set up a produce-consume feedback loop, and you should try to take advantage of that.

I try to keep track of other players' developments and planets (which is very important to do in this game), but it's still hard for me to manage even after much practice.  I actually think that it is critical to understand your opponents' motivations -- you should guess what they will choose as actions, and develop/settle cards that will give you actions for free without having to take the action yourself.

Still learning to play this game, it's very complex.  It's as if you must learn another language to play.  However, it's worth learning with everything that you can do in it.  I am looking forward to spend hours of learn time for this game.

A many-layered game of strategy compressed into a highly thematic deck of cards. The array of worlds to be settled and technologies to be developed consistently leads to intriguing contests and close finishes. Players' interaction is low, but as such it has its niche. Its kinship to Puerto Rico is noteworthy and appreciated.

Played once - loved it. Went down well with the rest of the group, I can see this becoming a firm favourite. Edit: played a few more times, just gets better. Familiarity with the icons is a must, once you've cracked that you're flying!

RATING: 6.5
Can't put my finger on it.  I really want to like this more and there's definitely something here that's itching me, but I'm just not fully behind this game so far.  It's not exciting.

Of course so far I've only soloed, and that without the expansion's solo  component, so perhaps there's hope.  But this one's falling a little shy of the mark.  Still good, but not to expectation.

UPDATE:  Has moved up for me with further play.

Unfortunately, this game is difficult to teach.  That is the only thing that keeps it from being played more, I would rather explain and play Puerto Rico than RftG.  With people that know the game, it is excellent and gives me more of the tactical game play than Puerto Rico does, although it is nearly impossible to come into the game with a strategy.  You are always simply reacting to your card draw and your opponent.

The best card game.
I would not have been even interested in this if my friend had not made me play with him. After that single play I barely understood all the rules and I had absolutely no idea about why I lost with such a great margin. But it got me thinking about the game for rest of the evening and the next day... and then on the following day I bought it myself! :)

-Amazingly deep game when comparing to its length
-Lot of different routes to winning
-(I've heard that it) gives challenge for a long time - haven't played nearly as much as I would have wanted
-Everyone that I have introduced this, have really liked it.
-Theme is there behind all those clever mechanics

RATING: 7
This game is really neat. It plays perfectly well solo - so well in fact, that all the 37 plays logged at the time of this writing are indeed solo plays against the robot, and I had even more plays against the AI version.

All the different roads to victory, the many interactions and comboes between cards, and the way the expansions mesh into the whole thing and make it into a complete whole, are quite brilliant. A really neat package overall.

This is a game I actually don't get to play anywhere near enough. I've played against the Keldon AI quite a bit, and against the solo robot. The reason why this is a 9 is thus mostly academic: I'm absolutely certain that if I'd have the right partner, I'd play this lots and lots. And I'm still searching for that victim.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After many more plays 400+, I can still play it from time to time but I feel the game has run its course (now I rate it at 7).  The design of the game is exceptional, even if the card art is poor (especially the very 90's sci-fi frames).  If you haven't played it before, its a solid 8/10 game, perhaps even 9/10 if you factor in how much this game does with just a deck of cards.

RATING: 8
I think the game is very good. But I have two problems with it. They are not earth shattering, throw the game out the window problems, but they are keeping the rating of this game from going up.

The first problem I see is the lack of player interaction. It really feels like your playing solitaire in group. There is not a lot of interactions and whatever the other players are doing rarely if ever affects what your doing. In my opinion, a space building game where you're trying to develop a whole civilization almost require player interaction.

The second problem is the randomness of the card draw makes it difficult to develop a sound strategy. You can get lucky and draw all the right cards making it an easy walk to victory or you might get screwed bad and not be able to accomplish anything because the deck just isn't turning your way.

Those two criticism aside, I still enjoy playing it immensely. Hence the 8 rating.

RATING: 6
RftG has a wonderful theme with all the SF gimmicks, but the game sports a difficult to grasp iconography, less streamlined than San Juan and more dependant on luck.
I like the way there are so many "thematic" strategies (although if you remove the theme veneer there are always quite the same), I like the way so many cards and combo feel carefully balanced, but I've played too many games where I felt luck decided the outcome; once you know how to play decently, that's all there is.
Sure a player with a few plays under his belts will trash a newbie, but when all players have made the effort to think about and know the cards, there is no other real skill to build; moreover, whereas in a game of Puerto Rico the seating order has an impact, here any player's stupid move might drag you down as well... not an improvement, and still good card draw will level clever play everytime.
I am not sure it is a bad thing at all; games can be really quick and when the cards come in your way and with a little geeky sf imagination, a win can be very satisfactory, so I feel happy to own this game which can feel fun and rewarding at times, but it is definitely not a top tier strategy game.

edit: these days I only keep the cardboard version and its extensions because the author made something so fun to play on the computer.  Face to face, there are better choices.

RATING: 7
Has a CCG feel in that cards can/should be used in combos.  There is little player interaction, other than the fact that you all draw from the same deck, and that the action you select (out of 7 or 8 choices) also allows the other players to do it (minus the bonus, a-la Puerto Rico).  Cost to "build/activate" a card is done a-la San Juan, where you need to discard a card.

An interesting combination of mechanics, and a relatively fast playing game (under an hour).

We are split on this one. My husband really enjoy it, but it isn't my favorite. It feels repetitive to me and a bit boring. The path to victory seems pretty clear and there are no interesting choices. I found San Juan to be very similar. He enjoys the theme and has found something in this one that I am missing. The iconography can be a bit difficult when you first start, but once you get it, most any other game iconography will come easily.

RATING: 4
Everyone I know seems to like this better than me. I had high expectations for it but it's just too unruly for me to really enjoy it. Teaching and learning the game is a problem, but mostly it's just bogged down by the many rules complications. On top of all that, it has even less player interaction than, say, Puerto Rico. If a group wants to play something like this, I'd suggest the less complicated San Juan.

Truly magnificent game. It has a bit of a learning curve, but once you have mastered the icons, you'll never look back. Works equally well with any number of players.  (Learning it as a two-player is probably better than learning it with more.  You have a bit more control over your destiny with two.) Surprisingly interactive for a game that also has a solitaire-side-by-side vibe. Perfect length. Beautiful cards. Downright addictive.

RATING: 10
Race for the Galaxy is a great example of not judging a game based on one or two plays.  I don’t think anyone in my family picked up on this one very quickly (for example, none of us used the “Consume – Trade” power during our first couple of plays, because we did not see the point -- *at the time*), and because of our slower understanding of how to *really* play the game, it seemed rather disappointing.  A few games later, however, and wow – did our opinion ever change!

This is probably my son’s favorite game (along with Dominion and its expansions), and one of my wife’s favorite as well.  And, as you can tell from the “10” rating I gave it, it is one of my all-time favorites, as well (at the time of this review, Agricola and Race for the Galaxy are probably my two favorite games).

role selection and tableau building with really awesome looking cards. The mechcanics are super smooth and almost has a competitive solitaire feel as there is next to no player interaction, but a very strategic game never the less.

This one has a lot to digest for folks not familiar with CCGs, even though this is not a CCG. I do like it very much, but I think that I won't "get it" until I play it more (4 plays already). So far, both my wife and I need to play with someone who knows the game, which means we'll get trounced but we get the opportunity to get more familiar with it. The art is fantastic, but I question the rationale of cards that are dark to the edges, especially when they get handled a lot like these will be. They will look terrible before long.

As a San Juan maniac I gotta have it.  More chaotic but with more interesting role selection process.  Need to get in games with experienced players who can see bigger picture, not set up one player to win.  Or try to be the set-up-ee.
Update: Now checking in with the minority.  I still like San Juan better for a slightly more elegant mechanism.  RftG has much more of a barrage of things going on all at once.

RATING: 8
[Initial Impression: 8]
I immediately liked the complexity and potential interactions between strategies, which puts it over the top compared to San Juan. The game clearly rewards knowledge of the cards and the ability to adapt to the card draws - allowing yourself to get too stuck in your initial strategy when the cards don't support it is a sure route to defeat. 

I like this game a lot, but after relatively few plays (10+), it was already feeling a bit samey. I think this is because there are only a few start worlds, and whoever is best able to capitalize on a strategy compatible with their start world generally comes out ahead.

We've started playing the variant where each player is dealt 7 cards, then must build one world and pay its cost (you may build a military world as if it were a non-military world during this setup stage) - that is your start world. The leftovers are your starting hand. This increases the variability dramatically, and forces you to decide whether to build a cheap start world and have a large starting hand, or build a more useful but expensive start world and be crippled with a small (or non-existent) starting hand.

I played it first at boardgamearena.com but i wanted to try it out in person. After 15 online games i was not sure how the game works, but with the belp of the boardgame club everything got clear. I don't like this game as much as i do with Glory to Rome, altough the game has huge replayability and it is fun to play. After 2800 online games im still learning how to play one specific card in a specific situation. I love that you have multiple choices which path you take. I have to admit that it is a big pain to teach, firstly you must teach all the simbols and the role selections can be a bit confusing too. But after they learned it, it seems to be a big hit and everyone just asks for a game.

Pros / Cons:
-I like it because every card can be played in different situations and the game is never ever the same.
-It is great to think over the situations and what role should i ask to get out in the best possible position while not helping to the opponent(s) more.
-I like it because it is fast and can be played more than once, the playtime is around 30-45 minutes, and i recommend it with any number.
-One of the best price / value game so far.

-I dislike it because of the very low interaction between the players.

A 2007 Christmas present.  This is another card-game version of Puerto Rico, similar to San Juan.  The learning curve is somewhat steep due to all the symbols on the cards.  For most people, you'll need to play the game once before it all sinks in.  Only takes about 30 to 45 mins to play once everyone knows how to play.  The more I play this game, the more I like it.  I am looking forward to the expansions that will add more players and more cards.

I haven't updated these comments in almost a year.  I'm glad that this trend died down with our group very quickly as I found this game to be very boring and with far too many stupid little icons.  Even after multiple games I'd be struggling to figure out quite exactly how things work.

It's like chess - perhaps fun with people near your skill level but with people who are really into the game and know all the cards, don't bother.  It's just not deep or fun enough.  No long term planning as cards are absolutely random and choosing a role brings in an unwanted level of player interaction.  People will harp on you if you pick suboptimal choices and it's just not fun.

Similar to San Juan eh?  Well then... I want it.

Got this for Amy for her birthday.  "San Juan in Space!"

Review:
After atleast 5 plays on our 1 week trip to the east coast, i can say with confidence that this is a hit.  As others have iscussed, the initial rules and the required icons are a lot to absorb, but the sheer number of possible strategies makes this a lot of fun.  I expecially like the "advanced" 2-player rules that let me choose two roles per turn.

RATING: 9
Race for the Galaxy (RftG) base is about my top overall game. [OFW: Obligatory Fanboy Warning]

The game itself is a hand management game, which took the base ideas formed into San Juan (about the same time), and greatly improved them.

Multi-use cards pose questions on use or application, and in some cases do not come into the game as an active card but as a passive good.

Multiple phases are laid out with very intelligently designed icons that tell players at a glance almost everything one needs to know about a card.

Good Sci-Fi artwork decorates the cards and adds to the thematic setting of the space exploration, exploitation card game.

The expansions are well thought-out, and are generally as good as the original, running to 3 different thematic arcs as of now.

Based on rating, #plays, portability, and well, just everything, this is the top dog, and will likely stay there.

Some History: (ancient?)

5/31/09 - First full play against the Robot from Gathering Storm, and won, albeit on NU-B level. 7.5 for starters, with possible upside.

6/11/09 - So far only a few solo plays, but I like the changing feel of this game a lot, and would realy like to play some FTF - raised to an 8.

7/12/09 - Up to 30 plays, almost all solo. Beating robot much more often, 1st win against Difficult level 7/11. This is a fascinating, fairly quick to set up & play, game with a lot of replay value. Hope to teach some friends to play and build some FTF plays, as that will definitely change the strategy and play - raised to an 8.5

8/08/09 - I've played a couple more FTF games, and like these better than the solo robot games; up to 45 now, and while this might not be the 1st choice if I have a whole day to play games, it is SO time effective that for shorter time slots it's almost always my 1st choice - raised to a full 9.0. (Also placed Rebel vs. Imperium on preorder).

02/09/10 - 100th play - Unfortunately, I lost- damn robot!

02/06/16 - Nearly 250 plays of the physical game later, including all 3 arcs (but not including any AI plays), I still love this game.

First play felt like learning a foreign language. I like learning foreign languages. Initial rating 7.

Wow, have I really played over 100 times in less than a year?!

The game is enjoyable enough, but I can't help but think of other games while we play.  Is this wrong?  Am I a bad person?  An unfaithful player?

And here we have a real winner! What a great game. I've played dozens of games on my PC against AI. Actually that's what convinced me to buy this. So kudos to who ever made that thing.

Fast, deep and varied. What's there not to like!? Yes, it can be harsh for a new player. You have to play a few games to get it. Icons? What about them? Difficult!? Now don't be silly. If I've teached this succesfully to new people, anyone can do it.

I really like the fact that every game is different. The game "forces" you to play differently each time, because of different starting world and cards. In some games it can come to the point where you always play the same way, but in Galaxy you have be able to change your playing.

Finally got a chance to play it to see what the buzz was about. It helps to have some background playing San Juan and/or Puerto Rico, so this was easy to pick up. Another newbie who was new to games in general got lost fairly quickly. The icons and symbols are somewhat confusing, but that's the nature of the beast. It plays like San Juan, with the exception of everyone secretly playing one of seven roles, which is a very neat mechanic, and the turns are deceptively fast for all the iconography involved. Race feels like it has more theme, with impressive and immersive artwork, than San Juan, which I can't help but think but it's simply Puerto Rico-lite with cards, and I don't have that feel of being governor of a plantation.

Update (4/11/09): Taught 2 San Juan veterans and 1 San Juan novice. Complex iconography had some confused until half-way, including me. There are many, many icons and these require referring the rulebook, and even then, it is somewhat confusing. Still, the veterans liked it, and enjoyed the SF theme (even though one of them doesn't like SF-themed games). I've upped the game play weight up to medium, since it does require substantial thinking to piece it all together.

I really like this game. It has a lot of the elements of Puerto Rico, but it seems better for two players  (and quicker to play too). I also really like the theme - I'm a scifi fan, and there aren't enough decent  scifi games around, imho!

The only slight problem is that our playgroup finds the Consume 2xVP action to be somewhat more efficient than other strategies.

After one play, this is a slick little game.  We're all fans of [i]San Juan[/i], and science fiction, so this one's a natural for my group.  I was lucky enough to know ahead of time that this was multiplayer solitaire with minimal "screwpportunity" and was, like it says in the title, a race game.  Bring your economic engine online, get it humming & working parasitically off of others' actions, rake in the VPs and end the game on your terms.  At least, that's the idea.  For me it was more like "guess wrong and waste several turns" and fall behind all red-shifted and small in the rearview scanners.

The integration of theme and design is very good—every card contains a nascent story.

STRATEGY NOTE:  Doing nothing but feeding heavy metals to Planet Disco will not get you the win.  No matter how cool it seems at the time.

Rating could rise (or decay!) with future plays.  We'll see...

UPDATE:  More plays, more of the game reveals itself.  Wonderfully subtle, and requiring a deft touch—at this point I feel like I'm doing brain surgery with Mickey Mouse hands and usually the patient... [i]dies[/i].  Most games that feel like this push you away and keep you from wanting to do the work to figure it out; this one is so captivating, so tip of the tongue, so [i]almost[/i]-that-time I find I can't wait to play again.  I feel there's a couple of metric tons of game in there, game that won't fully come to light until everyone is comfortable with the cards—much like [i]San Juan[/i] (in which, I must admit, I only recently figured out when to pick Prospector—but when I got that it became a whole new game).

And, as Dave says, "Pursuing the military strategy is just [i]fun[/i]."

So there's always that.

[b]After 70 plays:[/b]

[q="HiveGod"][i]Race for the Galaxy[/i] is a game that only opens up with experience—it begins as multiplayer solitaire; morphs into an actual race where the goal is to build an engine, pull into the lead and then end the game as quickly as possible; and finally becomes a game about knowing, intimately, what everyone else is up to in their tableaux so you can simultaneously draft off of their efforts while minimizing the amount of "help" you provide with your choice of action for the round.

That last bit is often never reached or grokked by the casual player, but it's truly where the game is—a player who doesn't pay attention to everyone else and chooses actions based on what they need most right now will always lose to the player who does pay attention and uses everyone else's play parasitically.

It can be obvious or subtle, and with good (experienced) players it becomes a very cagey game of quintuplethink, but to my mind it's well worth the work to get there.  There are few games that reward the effort as thoroughly as [i]Race.[/i][/q]

I was very curious how this game would play. I like S.Juan. This is deeper, thus it took me the whole game to get into it and by the end I still didn't know too well what I was doing. Deservedly I came last in a 4-player game. Need to play more times.

#Edit: I have had to re-rate this game from 7.5 to 6.5, simply because I really don't know what I'm doing as I'm playing it. I don't know the cards, I don't see the strategies, I spend half my time dumbly looking at the cards without knowing what exactly to do next, let alone think of a optimum play. I either buy this game and start playing it exclusively to learn it or I just give up. Maybe I'll just go half way and keep trying...

07/09/2008: Played a 3-player game yesterday and was able to mount a feeble "militaristic" strategy that led me to an amazing last place. Again.
Nevertheless I'm slowly starting to pick up on the basic intricacies of the game and how it should be played. I wish games went a bit further than the 12th building. I've decided I want to buy this game and I'll probably play it to death until I know  the cards and various strategies well.

As I had played San Juan 20-30 games, I thought that this would be very accessible to me. But no. The first try seemed like a rather mindblowing experience. This is a totally different game than San Juan. There are some similarities like in Genial and T&E. But the game is totally different. San Juan is a very intuitive game. R4G is not. I'll probably buy R4G after I am totally fed up with San Juan. Good game anyway.

The complaints about complications are a little over-stated, I think, though I did need a reference for a few things on my first play. For a game of galactic empires there just isn't enough (i.e. any) player interaction. When I play this game I spend 1% of the time deciding if someone else will choose a turn that will benefit me and 99% of the time doing my own thing.

While I'm not bored while playing it, it's not a game I'd ever ask to play. It feels more like an "activity" than a game; something to pass the time.

Superb gameplay! I don't mind the missing interaction between players. This one is about perfecting your deck, so I don't need others messing with it. The iconography is hard to grasp, but once that's out of the way the game gets you.

Nice theme and can get quite tense as you try and help yourself but not your enemies with your roll picks. There is quite a lot of luck though with some combinations working well due to subsequent picks and some failing completely. Still not so long or so deep to make this a big problem.

A word of caution about RFTG.  Make sure the person teaching you this game is a good explainer, or make the commitment to read and re-read the rules and the BGG boards to learn it correctly.  This is a great game, but it is very difficult to learn with all of the symbols.  Unfortunately, I was taught by someone who is not very good at explaining games.  So, I was pretty lost during much of my first game or two, and then got a sour taste in my mouth about this game and gave up.  Now, a couple of years later, I sat down with the game and was determined to learn it correctly.  Mission accomplished.  This is a great game with lots of depth.  Think of it as San Juan on steroids, with a space theme.  I love it and can't wait to play again and again.  Oh, and we need more expansions - many more - right away!

RATING: 10
This is a good game, it very casual and easy to learn, the game was designed very well and the symbols on each card makes the game very intuitive, by showing which phase the card has an effect for a what effect you get. As the name suggests, its a race, a race to the largest galaxy; but the problem with that is it reduces the amount of player interaction, its almost like playing solitaire. Players affect which action will be performed, but there is no way to stop someone, i feel that the action card should have had flaws for other players if they played during that phase. They also need cards that have global effect, that hinder or disrupt another players. You should also be able to conquer (through military) other players settlements (planets).

Overall its still a good game, as it is easy to teach, learn, and play. The game play could be more aggressive though.

This thing is the real deal.  I couldn't believe how sweet it was and I really only barely "got it". UPDATE: After about 12 plays (6 solo using Lucas Hedgren's system), this game keeps surprising me.  It does many things right: 1) plays quickly and doesn't overstay its welcome  2) provides a changing, robust decision tree that makes every turn a "nailbiter", with push-your-luck mechanisms  3) gives quite a bit of indirect interaction, predicting what phases you can get away with NOT placing on each turn.  Just a great package.
UPDATE: Yeah, it's a "10"
UPDATE: Well, maybe a "9", with a "9.5" including expansion and solo option

One of the best 2 player games!  Every game is different because your strategy must change depending on the cards you draw. Games typically finish in 30-40 minutes, so you can play two or three games in one sitting. Never tried the expansions, and the base game has never grown stale without the expansions.

I was looking forward to Race for the Galaxy more than any other game in 2007. While I am not a huge fan of Puerto Rico, I adore San Juan. As the game had been compared favorably with San Juan and was set in my favorite genre of Science Fiction, I eagerly pre-ordered this game at the Dragon's Table and waited for a couple of months.

The game is ok, but not as great as San Juan. I think that says more about my typical gaming opportunities than it does the game itself. We are not yet at the level where we are paying attention to our opponent's plays - perhaps that is why the game feels like multi-player solitaire. There is still potential here, but... for now we'd rather play San Juan.

I'm so over this game.  It seems that if you're new to it, you've got no idea what you're doing & after you've played it a few times you know exactly what you want to do & just try to make your plan work.  Also, there don't seem to be as many interesting combinations of cards as I feel there should be.  I would like to rate this lower but I remember that I did find it exciting at first & I do like sci-fi themed games.

:) Graphic design - Many people complain about this, but I feel like this is quick readability and language independence done right. So many games try be language independent and I feel they suffer for it. RftG's symbology is readable at a glance and perfect.

:) Interesting and satisfying tactical choices

:) Every time I hear its name I want to play it (which is relatively easy to accomplish with Keldon's AI)

RATING: 8
A really great game, but the main reason I didn't hold onto it is because I bought and taught Roll for the Galaxy first and everyone loved it. Switching to this one was definitely a harder endeavor for everyone that had only played Roll because of all the iconography and changes to how certain phases work. 

Decided to hold onto Roll over Race due to it being just that little bit easier to teach and it plays all player counts a little better than Race.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Quickly becoming one of my favorite games.

UPDATE: Our interest in playing this subsided a bit lately. I think Race is a bit overrated on BGG (perhaps because of well-implemented sci-fi theme and nice artwork on cards?). It is evidently good and I'm glad to play it, but not something amazing or mechanically-great. Definitely gets better with repeated and regular plays. On a plus side, my gf seems to really like it (it is one of her favorite games)!

o jogo é ótimo, ele apresenta diversas camaradas estratégicas e consequentemente revogabilidade altíssima, a única defasagem do jogo é a falta de interação entre os jogadores, porém o simples fato de você poder tentar prever a carta da ação do adversário já resolve um pouco isso essa interação pelo que eu entendi cresce progressivamente durante o primeiro arco de expansões mas não tive a oportunidade de testar nenhuma.

LOVE this game, such a clever design with a lot of viable strategies for victory. Don't be put off by the icons, they're easier to get your head around than they look, the game is AMAZING.

The expansions add more levels of play and alternative playing modes, but are only really worth it for the extra cards. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Well, it took me a couple of games to understand the icons and about a dozen to understand the strategy, but this has gradually become one of my all time favourites. A heavy, build your position game with some luck, certainly, but that's forgiveable in view of the brevity of the play. Like all 'blind action' games you have to gamble that your opponents will choose something that benefits you, and as a compound interest game you want to draw the cards that build on what you've got already. Complaints of minimal interaction certainly have some validity (you'll have to design your own cards using the blanks in expansion one to overcome this, but the system's extensible pretty much indefinitely) and the Consume-Produce loop is VERY powerful once you've seen it, making the base set something of a single strategy affair. For me this is 'Puerto Rico - the Card Game', but I can understand the feelings of those who say it's a much more modest achievement.

RATING: 6
Fast-paced, San Juan-esque card game. At the moment my rating for this is fluctuating.  I like the range of strategies understand why this is addictive. I've found myself playing it much more than expected, and I don't even own it. On the other hand, this game is frustrating when what you have  a hand full of things that don't work together or when you can't draw what you want, as the combos are extremely important. This problem is compounded by the shortness of the game--you are sure to draw something worthwhile EVENTUALLY, but it may all be over by then.  It is also undeniable that taking away the role selection decreases player interaction. 

It can stay a seven for now, since I will usually play it and think it's, yknow, pretty good, but it is in some danger of falling to a six next time I have a game where it seems murky.

EDIT: This seems to be one of those games you just keep playing... not necessarily because it is your favorite, but because it is a card game, it's fast and nobody complains about it too much.

EDIT: Seriously, I've played this game way more than I want to.

Fun game!  Trading it off because I find eminent domain a little more streamlined for my tastes, and seeking some new style of game for my community game club.

This game in my collection is fairly unusual in that it has some box wear and is missing the official manual, though a replacement was printed out.   Other than that, its good playing condition.

A quick game that's easy to learn and play - ignore all the griping about obscure sumbols and steep learning curves.  The manual explains everything and the symbols are quickly learned.

Brings a new dimension to the role slection mechanism.

The game can feel a bit like playing solitair, but repeated plays allows you to guess what your opponents are up to, allowing you to put spanners in their works.

RATING: 9
This game has a bit of a hurdle to get over if you're not familier with these sorts of card games and not good at remembering symbols. Once you jump over that, it works very well, as you can play the game almost mindlessly yet can use a nearly endless variety of strategies to win, all at the same time. It's amazing how a game so quick and easy can be so deep. Plus it scratches the same itch as customizable/trading card games (Magic: The Gathering and so forth), with an endless stream of getting new cards to add to your personal deck, and a constant need to figure out how they all work together in the most efficient way. It's all about synergy, and I love that sort of thing in my games.

Very good card game of development. Portable, scales well. Lacks diversity in the strategies, which is fixed by the expansions. The indirect interaction (try to guess what the opponents will do to make benefit of it) may not appeal to everyone (I admit I prefer direct interaction). Later in the game the calculations become a bit complex and one can't help thinking that it would be much easier played on a computer... and it is :)

RATING: 8.85
Un juego que toma los elementos principales de Puerto Rico (gestión de recursos, elección de roles) y crea un sistema muy sólido y profundo que se juega en un relativo corto tiempo. Mecánicas principales: elección de rol simultánea (altera mucho la forma de jugar respecto a su primo Puerto Rico). Información oculta que alienta el rollo Vizzinni (averiguar lo que va a hacer el otro para contrarrestarlo y viceversa). Combos de cartas. PROS. Sin aperturas estándard como en Puerto Rico. Mejora lo de ayudar sin querer al de tu izquierda. Interacción sutil y tensa (forzando a consumir prematuramente, jugando acciones que no beneficien al contrario, no jugar una acción que el otro espera ansiosamente, adaptar tu despliegue al juego del contrario). Espléndida relación entre duración y profundidad. CONS. Necesita expansión para ser interactivo de verdad. Imprescindible la piedra de Rosetta (ayuda de jugador) para descifrar los iconos de las cartas. Curva de aprendizaje elevada.Se podría jugar en piloto automático. No existe línea clara entre tus cartas y qué hacer para lograr los PV's. Azar (a veces el ganador es sencillamente el que mejores cartas le han tocado)

Baja de 9 a 8.8 porque entraron juegos mejores en mi colección y por no jugarlo tanto OCT 2013

This is a game that I think I really should enjoy, but it somehow missed the mark and it's likely the player interaction that causes this. Might be because I have only played the basegame without expantions.

RATING: 7
Gioco di carte che ricorda molto le meccaniche di Puerto Rico. Funziona - e può risultare anche avvincente, specie per i player incalliti - ma per essere un gioco di "combo", molto influenzato dalla fortuna, ha un grosso limite: chi conosce bene le carte è molto avvantaggiato, e per recuperare il gap bisogna studiarsele tutte. Al primo impatto, inoltre, anche a livello grafico, può risultare abbastanza ostico.

Finally got to play this last night.  Must say that I'm very impressed.  It definetly is "San Juan on Steroids".  It has the same basic mechanics as San Juan but it has many other ways to score points.  It is actually more like Puerto Rico than San Juan, in the fact that it is not just building and it does have some sort of shipping (consuming).  Must play more to know for sure but I'm sure my rating of this will go up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Pales in comparison to Fleet (which I played first), can't compare it to San Juan as I have not played that, but this is a reasonably enjoyable tableau building card game.  My biggest complaint - for God's sake someone smack some sense into the graphic designer!  I'm sure once you memorize all the myriad iconography the cards are easy to read, but some explanatory text wouldn't have hurt especially as most of the card is devoted to artwork.  Makes things look pretty, but makes the game much more cumbersome than it needs to be.

Feels a bit like Puerto Rico in a card game (San Juan?).  The theme feels pasted on, as I think an ancient civilization theme (as in 7 Wonders) would have been more appropriate.  I didn't find the symbology hard to follow at all (a common complaint with other people), but we only had one expansion (Rebel?) in play.

First played 12/11/07. Taught in ~10min, play in 45min w/4. Game contains good luck/strategy mix. Similar mechanics to San Juan. Players build cards (planets) in their play area, starting off with a free home base. On each turn, players secretly decide which action they will choose: Explore (gain more cards; choose from/keep more), Develop (build development; -$1 to build), Settle (build world; get extra card), Consume (VPs; VPs or $), or Produce (good(s); 1 free windfall production). $=cards in hand. All players take each action chosen that round starting with Explore, however special action is only taken by player(s) who chose that card. Windfalls are planets which need assistance to produce; however start with production. Settlements are non-military (stated cost) or military. Military require a specific military size achieved in play area (cards may state military size in red on line III). Hand limit is 10 after each round. Game ends when a player reaches 12 built in play area. Count VPs stated on cards and VP chips. Most VPs wins. A little challenging to piece everything together. Once you get through the first 1-2 games, it will go smoother and faster. I'd strongly recommend trying it out especially if you know someone with it. Give purchase & regular basis play consideration.

Very similar in many ways to San Juan. It's a little hard to learn the icons at first, but not too bad (and there are player help sheets).  We are really enjoying this game (we tied the first game and I won the other two) and looking forward to getting an expansion or two.  It plays so nicely with two and doesn't take a long time (30min), though I always want another turn or two to play a few more planets.

RATING: 10
Fun and deep game.  My only complaint is the size of the deck.  I've never considered buying a shuffler until now, but if I can find one that doesn't mark the cards this game has inspired me to purchase it.  It is multiplayer solitaire, but that's OK because there's plenty of planning and strategy in your own hand.  I just wish I'd have figured out that Consume - trade is the key to the game earlier on. :)

RATING: 10
I like the artwork on the cards and the science fiction theme.  This game is not extremely complicated, but it requires several plays to really grasp everything that is happening in the game. One of the more interesting aspects of Race for the Galaxy is how each card can potentially be played to provide victory points as well as provide persistent benefits, but the cards are also used as cash to pay for other cards.  When you play a card and add it to your tableau, you are forced to choose which cards in your hand to discard to pay for the card being played.  Players are constantly making stimulating decisions in their efforts to maximize their score.  All players get to perform each of the chosen actions, but they benefit from a bonus when performing the action they chose.  A significant consideration should be dedicated towards trying to benefit more from the phase your opponent chooses than your opponent benefits from the phase you chose.

It's so clashy and disorganized and ugly. You've got all the prettiness of space lending itself to this theme, and it's being wasted.

06-12 - I'm enjoying learning this game, but I'm constantly looking up or double-checking icon meanings.  Sometimes we just discard a card that looks too confusing to keep the game moving.  There isn't really any player interaction, which is fine, but I do like screwing up an opponent's plan.

One play so far... need more.  I imagine the possibilities with this game are numerous and in the first play I had a great time of planning and seeing my plan come to fruition.  It has the cool special power kind of card combination mechanics that I like.

After more play raised rating to 9.  The game is pretty fun even after you know all the cards.  I'll even play this solitare under Roland's solitare rules in the files section.

Advanced San Juan . . . in space.  [Although I like it a lot more than San Juan.]

Great theme, great design.  Just something about this genre of game (San Juan, Glory to Rome) that just doesn't click for me as quickly as I think it should.  Probably a function of my not being a big-time CCG player.

It took 3 plays for the hieroglyphics on the cards to actually mean anything to me . . . and finally by my 7th game, I felt like I could piece together a strategy using my cards in hand.  By games 15 - 20, I began to realize what other players were working on and how poorly I used to play.

If you're willing to put in some "investment" plays, this will be a fun, quick game in the collection.

Well, after a long wait, I finally got to play this game.  And in many ways, it lives up to it's potential:

Pros:  Amazing selection of cards lend themselves to a diversified selection of strategies.  After even a single game, all of the iconography makes sense and you don't really need even reference sheets.  Simultaneous selection of almost all choices speeds up the game play.

Cons: There is less interaction than San Juan.  There is player interaction, but it's still pretty scarce.  Maybe after a few more games I'll be able to better pay attention to what everyone is doing.  In the mean time, with everything happening simultaneously, I just concentrated on myself.


In the end, it's not the greatest thing since sliced bread, but it's a darn good economic card game (Much better than St. Petersburg IMHO).

Apr08: The speed man.  It's the speed.  I'm looking to this game more and more for just how much in can pack into under an hour.

Con: Extremely complex game, requiring at least one play to understand. Graphics, text, and iconography make the cards extremely noisy. Almost too complex for a card game. Random card draws make it difficult to intentionally choose a strategy. No direct player interaction.

the concept and game mechanic works very well. the only problem I have is hand management in that you have 2 hands of cards. One is your "Role" hand and the other is your Main hand. The  way to solve that is to put  your "Role" hand in different coloured card sleeves.

I enjoy this game as both a 2 player and with multiple opponents. The end result really does have a "Race" like feeling as players dash to get a working strategy out of the deck and into play before somebody triggers the end of the game. Great game.

Once you get a feel for how the various actions work, it can still take quite a while to uncover the various strategies that the cards can support. Fun, challenging, relatively fast to play; but there's a fair amount of luck-of-the-draw here, too. Sometimes fate just presents you with a beautiful combination of cards for an almost effortless win.

What bad thing could be said of a game that takes seconds to set-up, less than 30 minutes to play, doesn't bog you down with the table layout, and doesn't require you to memorize every single cards ability, but rather only a series of symbols. 
Living in Japan, it's so important for me to find a game that reduces all of it's complexity down to a series of symbols than any nationality could understand. And this game does it flawlessly. 
The parasitic nature of the turn order, simultaneous actions and the satisfaction from chaining resource production makes this game a must for any strategy and/or resource management fan. (^_^)

Amazing what a card based version of puerto rico can become!  Although little to no player interaction currently, the theme works nicely with the well designed gameplay, Usage of iconography makes for a complicated but fun to learn game and the addons will add the interaction overtime as well as more diverse strategies.

Wow.  Quick playing, with enough depth to leave you with plenty of options each games and no forced path of action, I find this a major improvement over San Juan.  Of course, I am a sucker for the theme, but the simultaneous selection of actions leads to great double thinking.  Can't wait for the extensions.

OWNED SINCE 2012
I recently got this game, based on the many positive reviews here on BGG. This is a great game and it is everything everyone said it was. I am glad I choose this over San Juan and Puerto Rico. I also bought the first expansion, Gathering Storm, which is a nice but not as much of a value. For me, it only adds a few new cards, 1 more player, and that is it. It also comes with Goals, which are VP that can be collected for being the first to accomplish something, but my wife does not like them. The expansion also comes with blank cards (that I will never use) and pieces to play the game 1 player. The 1 player is cool, but I will never use it. I am glad that I got the expansion, but others might have provided more contents that I would use.  
UPDATE: I think one of that things that impresses me the most about this game is there are so many different paths to victory. I recently played my wife and at the end I looked at her table and thought she had won by a lot, but after counting points it was a tie @ 41 VP each. We just had very different tables and ways of earning our VP that you could not tell the winner by just looking at the board.

RATING: 9
One of my favorite games, after 10 years I'll still play. I like how quick it is, and the optimization puzzles, betting/planning, and reading players are fun challenges. Since there's a good amount of randomness and hidden info there's not too much AP - looking ahead only really helps for maybe a turn.

I like both 2p with double actions, and the more traditional board-game feel of 3p+.

Race for the Galaxy certainly bears a family resemblance to San Juan, but I much prefer the theme of Race. The latter is a more complex game, but the layout and design of the cards ensures that it is easy enough to play. The added complexity makes Race a more tactically interesting game than San Juan without adding to the length of play. The game works well with 2, 3 and 4 players.

one of my most played and enjoyable games. so many strategies, incredible artwork and card/parts quality amd a quick play. this is always hitting the table. i've even got my dad requesting this. i originally said it was easy to learn and looking back on it, i've taken that out of the comments. i think it depends on how familiar you are with San Juan (or Puerto Rico). if you're very familiar with these, learning how to play isn't difficult. if you're not familiar with SJ or PR, then it may take about 4 or 5 games to get an understanding and 10-20 to really get the hang of it

One of the best games i've played.Immensely deep and immersive and crazy addictive.I've been playing on boardgamearena.com for a few days and each game is a joy to participate in.At the beggining the learning curve seems as steep as Everest,but as you play you realise that the game is more of a "get the hang of it" rather than actually having to learn something.I must point out that the difficult thing for begginers is definitely the iconography.It's all strange icons and symbols and hands and hexe's and numbers in the beggining and some things will seem ridiculous to look at.My advice is just keep playing and at some point you will realise that you are actually slowly getting used to the icons and paying more attention to what's going on.Take it easy and you'll see.The art is incredible,the cards are well balanced and i love how you pre-plan your game based on the starting planet and how easily your plans can be altered (if the circumstances are such that measures must be taken),or how smooth your strategy can play out if you decide to go with it.One of my favorite games.

I am beginning to think Tom's designs aren't for me.  I thought the effects in this game were less interesting than San Juan.  I am also not sure that I like the blind action selection, as it adds a mind reading element that does not seem to add much.  Finally, the art, while attractive does not convey any meaningful information, and sort of distracts from what you need to look at.  By that I mean, you can look at a card in San Juan, see it is the well, and know its the well.  When I look at a card in Race for the Galaxy, I see a bit of sci fi brick a brack, but it is not clear what it does or why.  I can imagine my impression improving with time.  My impression of San Juan certainly has.  But the first impression was not a strong one.

Thanks Joe.  Starts out as an uphill climb to understand the terminology and symbology.  However, once you get it, you start to see the variety that is inherent in the card deck.  Can't wait to play it again. Update after 5 plays:  This just gets better and better.

As is, the optimal strategy is to randomly draw more synergistic cards than your opponents. I could be convinced to play it like a customizeable card game where each player had their own deck that they would cull a certain percentage of the cards from before playing to promote actual strategies and counter-strategies, but I'd rather play [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/108687/puerto-rico-limited-anniversary-edition]Puerto Rico[/url]

My current favorite game. I can't sit down and play this without wanting to get at least 4-6 games in a row. The first game or two can be daunting for new people, but if you can make it past that then you can't have too many better gaming experiences than this, in my opinion. Tons of strategies, and subtle player interaction that is quite satisfying. Can't recommend this enough.

I love It! It is the perfect game to play in 30 minutes before or after a long one. Once you understand the symbols and every player plays at certain speed it goes very smoothly.
Maybe some issues are that you almost do not interact with other player, is a multisolitaire game, if you are using several expansions it is messy to shuffle the discard pile and, the most important, the tablet version is amazing!

RATING: 8
Very solid card game.  Reminds Puerto Rico and San Juan a bit (a few ideas from Thomas Lehmann were borrowed and incorporated into San Juan, but Lehmann ended up with this game).

The problem for the beginners might be a ton of different cards to familiarize with.  But you learn them quickly and the gameplay is smooth very soon .
 
I really like the game alhough there's some luck factor (expansions only magnify the problem) and some solitaire play in it.  But the game is short and you can always repeat the play.  And - above all - it is fun :)

Well Tom has finally done it, in fact I think some of his other games were just primers for this one, like Phonecia for example which just wasn't polished enough. Tom really likes these Civ building engine style games and now it looks like he has near-perfected one albeit a lot is borrowed from PR ans SJ. 

The problem with some of his other games is they come out very dry and strategy can be quite subtle, this game has the subtlety but finally got rid of the dryness. The theme does come out in the game nicely, I don't really feel like I am building in space or anything but some things do make sense thematically. 

Yes more or less multiplayer solitaire but when you can crank out a game in about 25 minutes I don't care, also the expansion is possibly going to add some screwage if you want it. It also is not true solitaire, you do have to watch the other players carefully and try to leech off their actions as much as possible, similiar to other games of this nature. This leeching actually adds a guessing element and a push your luck element as well as you might take some chances other people are going to do something to max out your efficiency. There really are not enough 20 to 30 minute MEATY games and this will be in my collection because it is and it supports 2 players. 

The game has a significant learning curve, 1 or 2 games just for the icons and a lot more to learn the cards, combos and strategies. The symbols are quite helpful after a few games but I still have to look them up, as the game is so fast this looking and wondering is really lengthening my overall learning curve which is already steep. There are a lot of cards and learning how they intereact and pair up is really going to take a lot of games.  As lots of people have noticed, this is good and bad, bad for people just trying to jump in and play and not wanting to have the patience to really 'learn' the game, good for those who will take the time as it will really add to the replay and overall depth of the game.

[u]UPDATE[/u]: Well San Juan does seem a little more streamlined and here luck might play an even bigger factor. When and which big scoring cards you get is of course subject to the card draw and if you are building towards one of them and don't get it your doomed because someone else did get their 'big building'. You can also try to grab them early and hold onto them while building towards them, this is a more sure-fire method but holding cards will cost you. There certainly is a lot more to explore here than SJ although it still feels like a race, at least this game isn't pretending not to be a race!

[u]UPDATE[/u]: 6 => 7 After 5 plays Race definitely has that addictive quality where you want to play again and try to improve on your last playing. There is also a ton of variety and enough depth to certainly keep you interested as well. I'm pretty sure my rating is going to keep trending upward but the luck factor will most likely keep it from top tier for me. 

[u]UPDATE[/u]: 7 => 7.5 Yep, it's starting to come together after 7 plays, the payoff certainly will be bigger than the pain in learning

[u]UPDATE[/u]: 7.5 => 8 Well the wife didn't like this at first BUT now she is requesting it. It's a fun 30 minute game and makes an excellent 2 player game (best imo for lower luck) as well as scaling up to 4 perfectly. I think there must be at least 5 or 6 strong strategies to go for which allows for good flexibility and also helps mitigate card draw luck. Getting the big 6's early and building towards them is the only way to go to also mitigate luck however between 2 fairly equal players luck is going to be a big factor in who wins, in a 30 minute game I'm okay with that. We are seeing a bit of a ceiling now after 12 games but we still have a ways to go and we still enjoy it and want to play as it's so short and interesting. San Juan would bore me to tears I think now, this put the shipping element back into the game which is another viable strategy. Here's how I see the progression in RFTG:

1 - 4 games to really get the symbols down where you don't look them up (2 to 3 average). 

5 - 10 games to really start knowing the cards and [i]start[/i] seeing the different strategies available and subtle interactions. 

10 - 20+ games to really know all the cards, how they combine and knowing which strategy to go for and when.  

Current high score is around 78

[u]UPDATE:[/u] 8 => 8.5 Have played 30 times and we always come back this and always will. TGS expansion while most of it isn't useful, the 3 big 6's give another 3 paths, just for those you pretty much need the expansion. Excellent 30 minute game for 2 players, would play with 3 or 4 too but the luck is higher at those numbers. One of the best card games for 2 players along with Netrunner and Haggis.

[u]UPDATE:[/u] 8.5 => 9.5 I don't know what is wrong with me, but I should of had this rated a little higher long ago. Probably played 50 times by now (this feat alone means its worthy of this rating, could be the only game I've played that many times as most [i]really good[/i] games peter out at ~25 for me), and out of the 750 different games I've played to date it is one of our favourites for sure. Multiple strategies to explore/ paths to victory IS the biggest strength imo here, and its wonderful. Luck is mostly in check IF playing only 2 players and don't use cards for goods (see my Tidbit below). Theme comes through fairly well and art is lovely on the cards. The Goals from expansions add another "path" almost, they are nice point grabs you really have to watch out/shoot for, the more we played with them the more we liked them and they add some tension as well as its yet another thing you are [i]racing[/i] for. 

I guess what holds it from 10 for me is some luck of the draw (This is what held my rating a little down originally but have decided its mostly in check esp for the game time. Note you can't just shoot for a strat and see it through from the beginning, it might work or might not just due to luck. So normally you see what fate hands you first [6's], and try a strat based on that, and usually will work out well that way but you seldom still might need/want a card and just don't get it, when you do though, shazamm!) and we do play with a couple of [i]small[/i] tweaks for preference/overall balance with expansions added, like ending at 14 cards and a slight increased amount of VP's, but this is pretty much a perfect game at least for us when you can play something with this depth in 30 - 60 mins, a true classic that will always remain on our shelf.  

[b]Tidbit[/b] - to reduce luck DO NOT use cards for goods, this was a bad design decision IMHO as you randomly take out much needed cards by the players, why? (reduced bits in box, and not enough thought to negative effect that's why imo) They should have included cardboard chits for goods, use cubes from another game and enjoy the reduced luck

Bought this in the early summer (2010) in a discount sale on strong recommendation that I would love the game.

Despite the best intent of several players who love the game trying to teach me the game, I can not get my head around any of it.

Perhaps it is because I dislike San Juan (I play, but don't enjoy and never get close to winning, even two player!) and Puerto Rico?

It now gathers dust in my loft, creeping slowly to the trade/sell pile........!

MAR13 Sold. It was either that or throw it in the card/paper re-cycling. A dreadful "game" (I struggle to call it a game). Zero fun. I would rate it lower but there are worse games out there (hard to believe, but true)..

RATING: 7
The learning curve of this game is overstated, there are a lot of symbols, but you should be comfortable with it after a couple games. The reason I'm not so wild about this game is that as far as which cards to play when that always seems pretty straightforward, the only real decisions come from having to predict which actions your opponents will want so you can get as many double actions as possible while denying your opponents the same, and this is a perfectly valid way to have a game but it's not really for me (though I'm happy to play it every once in a while.) It also seems like luck of the draw becomes a big factor between people of roughly equal skill, though it's quick enough that this isn't a huge problem.

As with so many other people, this has become one of our go-to filler games, as its down to about a half hour play time.  At that pace, the number of interesting trade offs in the game really pays off, and after thirty plus plays, I'm still interested in playing this.

EDIT:  Well, I'm easily into triple digits now, between lunchtime play at work, online PBEM play and against the AI, and it's still fantastic.  I've easily played more of this game than any other game in the past five years.

I love space themes and the illustrations are gorgeous and add lots of theme.  You draw hands and then play them, discarding cards from your hand as the cost.  Every card has special abilities.  The biggest learning curve is learning what all the symbols mean.  Many paths to victory.  Games are always over too quickly, just as you're getting going.  It's fun to put together powerful combos.  There is a definite element of chance as to what cards you draw though.

San Juan fell out of the rotation because I got bored with it - there was only one real way to play it until you found your six point card, and then you would formulate a plan for the last 2-3 turns from there (and even then, the 6 pointers were pretty unbalanced.)  

This is San Juan on steroids, better in every facet.  Several productive early game strategies, six pointers are more balanced, there's almost always a way to work with the garbage you've been given and stay competitive until help arrives.  And it plays in half an hour.  Can't say enough good things about this.

The iconography makes learning the game much more intimidating than it should. Once you get the hang of things (and it shouldn't take long), play is super quick.

A beautiful two player gaming experience.  Yes, it's a race and some may argue solitaire-like.  On some levels, this is true.  However, frequent game play, understanding key card combinations, spotting trends in your opponent's build patterns leads to a deep intuitive gaming experience.  Classic.  Belongs in every collection.

Brian went military tonight. Tough to beat when he's pulling the right cards. I fell behind on the Settlement/development phases and lost traction. Beaten bad. 

2017, finally started on the expansions. Loved Gathering Storm, found the attack mechanic in Rebels too clumsy for a 2p, and the game lost some of its charm, but the addition of Brink of War brought everything back into balance.  Still not playing attack mode, don't use the solitaire feature but the first arc with 2p or 3p is a great game.

I don't hate this game, but I find it's mastery curve too steep to really find myself wanting to play it over and over - which is needed to truly appreciate the game (translation: I'll probably never give this game its real due).

The moment my copy arrived, I sleeved all of the cards.  These are identical in size to Magic cards, so there are plenty of sleeve choices.  I went with the fairly expensive "Japanese" brand metallic sleeves for the main deck, and some heavy UltraPro for the role cards.  This doubled the cost of my set, but in the long run it's going to pay off.  I expect to play this game a lot.

I'm a huge fan of San Juan, and enjoy but rarely play PR.  I'm also a long-time lover of Magic.  Combining these becomes a no-brainer for me.  Race is a ton of fun.

The multiplayer solitaire complaints are nonsense.  Have those people play face up against experienced players and see if they still feel isolated and free to do whatever they want.

Have played a single four-player game, six three-player games, with the remainder being two-player games using all the setup options (experienced being my favorite).  Wow... there is a lot going on with the cards.  You can definately see the advantage of getting a good synergy within your tableau, but also have to try and "keep up" with the "race".  With additional players taking advantage of other's phase selections become critical. I look forward to many more games, trying to develop a better understanding of the cards and roles.  My rating will undoubtedly rise, and I can see this game passing San Juan.  Finally tried the experienced two-player game.  Having two extra actions and being able to pick two definately add to the feeling of control in a two-player game.  Good stuff!

This game is a more complex version of San Juan. It may be excessively fiddly for a card game. I'll rethink my score of a 6 after a second play. It's likely that this game is much better after a few plays.

SAAN JUUUANN in Space [said in a "Pigs in Space" voice].  Really good - better than San Juan.  A well designed labor of love.  Very true to its theme, with nice allusions to the universes of David Brin and Frederick Pohl and other science fiction authors.  The graphic design is clear and elegant.  The quality of the playing cards and reference cards is great.  Only downside is the very minimal player interaction; the role selection seems unthematic.

The rule book is rather well written, at least in comparison to other games. Note that the Consume phase of the game can be confusing, but the forums here provide a lot of help.

It is a bit of a two-player solitaire game, but I like that about it. We don't just sit there in silence playing -- we talk to each other, we encourage each other, we swear at each other. It's a fun interactive game that doesn't actually require interaction.

It is a player vs. player game, but it is not too competitive, and it is completely non-confrontational. There's no blocking or stealing. I repeat, I like that. The process of playing and building is the fun part. Who wins or loses is secondary.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is a very well-designed game, and despite the random chance of what cards you draw, there is always a strategy to be found and developed as you play.

Bonus points when you play with people who know the game and can play much faster; the frantic pace makes it more exciting. Can be a burden for more casual gamers.

I tend to get burned out on this game after a few play-throughs, and it takes a while before I'd want to play again.

The game that got us back into table top games after a 6 year absence. The sci-fi theme's deep enough to float a Peter F Hamilton trilogy in every hand.

The solo (first expansion) and drafting variants are also fun.

RftG is a very good Puerto Rico-like cardgame. In some aspects very similar to San Juan, of course, but more complex and much more interesting than that game. In some ways it feels almost like a mix of San Juan/Puerto Rico and a CCG like Magic: The Gathering, borrowing the complex and interesting card interaction and potentials for strong combos from Magic.

I have been positively surprised by RftG: I dislike San Juan and my expectations for RftG weren't high before trying it. However, the game has exceeded any expectations I could have had and I have thoroughly enjoyed all my games so far. It is a solid game that feels a lot less one-dimensional than San Juan. So far, it seems the hype is warranted ín this case.

I really, really like this game. I don't find the iconography difficult at all, and I love the sometimes painful decisions and delicious combos. (2011)

However, I don't have a consistent enough group to make this one hit the table regularly. While I don't mind the icons at all, some others have difficulty with them so this isn't a fun game to teach and play right away. Also, I seem to have much greater aptitude for this game than my most regular group of gaming friends - I never lost while playing with them. That's unusual with this group, and I'd rather play a game that is more balanced between us. (2018)

This is one of those games that astounds me at the differences of taste in our hobby.  

I found this to be astoundingly complex to learn.  My friend and I agreed that it doesn't have a learning curve, it has a learning spike that you impale yourself on...  It really favors experienced players and has no theme whatsoever.  On top of that it's basically a solitaire game.  I appreciate the variety of tactics and I bet it has good replay value, but this just didn't work for me at all.

Ironically, the same friend who helped coin "learning spike" ended up loving it...

RATING: 9
Perfect balance of depth and speed.  Improved by each expansion.  Very elegant gameplay, iconography is spot on for repeated play (And probably not good if you go 8 months between plays).  One of my favorites, and I like it more and more over time.

Each layer of strategy slowly shows itself to you over time, with more plays.  At first, as you're learning the mechanisms of the game and how they interact, you need to get a feel for how to expand your holdings; when you should dump cards that may be useful, and when you should hold back for something better.

Next, you learn and become comfortable with the potential range of helpful cards you're likely to get, in roughly what quantity, and how they interact.  You're apt to find powerful combinations and focus too much on building towards them, slowing yourself down quite a bit - note that a game played at a very slow pace with this sort of groupthink can produce stunning point totals.

When you're starting to get comfortable with the fact that when you're ahead, it's almost always best to push the game forward, is also the time you start realizing how important it is to look at what your opponents are doing, and take risks based on what they're likely to do.

When this happens, you become an OK Race player.

The game is still random enough that repeated play will result in a significantly more experienced player losing, but the odds are tilted in the better player's favor as much as any single draw deck card game can get.

Suffice to say, I feel I've merely scratched the surface of this game (Probably ~30 plays in person and many multiples of that on the computer).  While I don't particularly desire to play it 5 times in a row like some people do, rarely do I go more than a few gaming sessions without playing a game of Race.  It's the defacto filler+ for us.

Initial Rating: 8.0 (June 2010)

I love RFTG, it’s my most played game of all time (except for MtG) and its on my top ten favorite games. I bought the game accidently and it was a happy one for a change :D.

RFTG has a surprising depth and I think the luck factor is rather low as the best player almost always wins, it has a short play time, plays nicely with 2,3,4,5 or 6 players (with the expansions) as the plays are simultaneous, it has a great theme (I love space games) and the art is terrific. On the bad side this game has a steep learning curve, EXPERIENCE MATTERS, so I have a hard time finding opponents to play with. One complaint from my gaming partners is that the iconography is very confusing, I have never understood this objection, for me, the iconography (almost all of it) is pretty clear and fairly intuitive.

I totally recommend it, if you find it difficult to learn, I encourage you to play through the pain, You won’t regret it.

My girlfriend finally is requesting this game, she says she likes it more and more with each play. I’m so happy :D. For so long, no one in my game group wanted to play this with me :D.

I’m downgrading its rating to a 9.0 so my feelings for the game match the BGG recommended rating system. RFTG is an excellent game for me, one I always want to play. It is still in my top ten of favorite games.

It’s been almost 5 years since my first RFTG play and I still want to come back for more. It is no longer my most played game (Dominion is), but I still love the game and I´m always ready to play it. I’m thrilled that it is my SO favorite game :D, so now I can always play it if I want to. Also my game group has increased a lot during this 5 years, so many friends really like the game. 

I no longer consider a negative the steep learning curve, I have found that many of my favorite games share this trait. The real negative for me is having to teach the game. I have done so many times in the past and I’m getting better, but it is always a time consuming task and many times is for naught as some players won’t touch the game again. A RFTG game between two experienced players is pure bliss.

I have played the game many times, but sadly, I haven’t explored the expansions as much as I wanted to. The only one I have really played is The Gathering Storm. The reason for this is that most of the time we had newish players so we left off those cards. Another small issue is that if I play with the expansion and later want to pay with only the base game, separating the cards is time consuming. I’m thinking about buying another base game to avoid this.

Bottom line, RFTG is a GREAT game. I don’t think I will ever get tired of it. Now, I vastly prefer to play it as a two player game.

Race for the Galaxy is  great game and I won’t ever get rid of it, however, it’s become harder and harder to play this in our game gatherings, explaining the game is a chore so my desire to play the game has diminished a bit. I’m very glad new expansions continue to appear for the game.

For lovers of complexity like me, this is strictly better than San Juan.  There are numerous different strategies, and the cards combo together well enough for even a former Magic: The Gathering player.  I discovered new combinations constantly throughout my first 25-30 plays.  No, there's not much direct player interaction -- but if I want that there are other games I can play.

Iconography can make this game difficult to teach.  Even after more than 100 plays, though, I'm still willing to play this any time.  As much as my wife loves RftG, I think this game may have obsoleted all of the other two-player, sub-60 minute games in my collection.

No rating yet as I have played "Race for the Galaxy" a grand total of once. We had a stellar game that was a one point separation between all totals. Very close game.

I did not feel a ton of player interaction in it and I did miss it for one reason alone: I couldn't see how to stop--or even impinge--a running victory point engine across the table, but I did realize the game is exactly as advertised: a race. 

I had a lot of fun and I want to play more to get familiar with cards and tricks. I also greatly enjoyed the theme and did not find any issues with the iconography. I was able to pick it up fairly quick and managed to put in a very good showing vs. experienced players.

It was a Hell of a tight race. Not bad considering they could always choose the card they wanted from their hand.

I played "Glory to Rome" a number of weeks after "Race to the Galaxy". I may like that one a bit better, but both systems need more play. 

In contrast, "Glory to Rome" had a lot of player interaction and I could hamper another's play and still siphon off their moves as needed. I had a lot of room to maneuver. 

I should note that I did not feel stymied in either system and both allowed me paths of play each turn. I did not feel locked into one option in either game and could be flexible when needed.

"Race for the Galaxy" is a great looking game that flows well and I did have fun. Will I buy it? Maybe. I need to play it more and see what the expansions do to it. They could make it an absolute must. I do think the game is very worth owning.

Race for the Galaxy is a great resource/hand management game. Every card you get can be played out or can be discarded in order to play another card leading to fun and interesting choices for which cards to keep and which cards to discard. The game can be a bit of a bear to learn because of all of the symbology. Once you get used to the symbols, Race for the Galaxy can be played very quickly. I really enjoy how quick the game plays while still having quality decisions during a game.

Picked up based on my liking for San Juan and the good press here on BGG, one play only.

I was left bewildered by the array on icons on display - it looks more like a piece of software than a cousin of San Juan! 

With the unintuitive iconography and large variety of cards in the deck, it looks like there's quite a learning curve on this one. I shall persevere...

I'll hold off rating the game until I've got a better feel for it.

Fantastic sci-fi card game. It plays best with 2 or 3 players. The game has a rich strategy without being overy-complicated; giving players multiple options for obtaining galactic conquest.

I like this game a lot. The cost is a little high for what works out to be two decks of cards - using card sleeves is necessary for long-term play. Addicting - it's like that viral behavior of Settlers - you play it a bit, then you start wanting your own copy to share with other friends.

RATING: 8.5
- A great game. I love the combos. It's really satisfying when you're able to massively pull off a particular strategy. 
- There is a fair amount of luck though in terms of the cards you draw and when you draw them.
- Really should be played 2 player. 3-4 players is okay, but the game really shines in a head-to-head setting as there's less luck/reliance on correctly predicting which actions players will pick. You're also able to achieve more on your turn with two actions. I feel this helps balance the Military vs. Produce+Consume strategies.
- With two players I find myself focusing more on the other player to anticipate their actions. You also might want to play cards that don't really fit into your strategy but take advantage of what your opponent is doing. With 3+ players, this feeling is diminished as players turn inwards, selecting the one action they need to happen.
- Massive learning curve due to all the iconography, especially if you include the expansions.
- Adding/removing expansions from the deck is a pain. My preferred combination of expansions is probably #1+#2 without takeovers, however #3 does flesh out some of the alternative strategies and helps minimise luck of the draw. It does however add complexity and slows the game slightly.
- I like playing this game fast and gung-ho. Better to play 3-4 games in quick succession than 1-2 slowly, carefully choosing every card to spend/discard. As a result, I avoid teaching this game or playing with newbies.

This is SAN JUAN in space with better production value and varied play. I would give it a better rating but it's Not Geezer-friendly!$#@$%! The print and symbols could be bigger to be able to see it better, other than that I really like the game. 

All the games logged here have parts of the 1st 3 expansions included in the game. I cherry-picked the cards and rules I want to use for regular plays.

Could a card game get any more confusing than this one?  Exceptions to actions, confusing card symbols, unclear rules,.. just a few of the problems we had while muddling through  our first few games.  After my second attempt, by rating has gone down.

I figured that after playing the game once, the symbols on the cards would get easier to understand... nope.  MAYBE ONCE YOU'VE PLAYED THE GAME 100 TIMES.

Another game that takes a simple system (like San Juan) and turns it into a monster.  I'm sure that there is lots of strategy here (if you ever figure out the cards) but, if you are a casual gamer, it's probably best to try (and I do mean 'try') to play a couple of games and then leave this on the shelf... the learning curve is that steep.

If you tend to play the same game 50 or more times, this might be a great addition to your collection but if you are like me, who might get to play the same game maybe twice in a year, RftG is a good one-shot and nothing more.

I think that I'll stick with San Juan.

This game was fine. The icons and learning how to play was a bit too difficult to get into but the learning curve is very steep at the beginning and drops off nicely once you get used to it. But the strategy part is still hard to grasp. I am playing around solitaire against AI, but half of the time I am really confused as to what to do each turn.

I don't think that I can bring this out to my friends but once you can get past the icons and not so intuitive game play, the game really draws you in.

When I sit down on computer and I have spare time, first thing I do is play this against AI. I can play 4-5 games so quickly, and it provides such a challenge. Great game. This game gets better with each plays. I gave up recording game plays for this game because I must have played over few hundred times as I play this everyday against AI.

After several more plays, I have learned to really appreciate this great game.  Sure, there's a bit o' luck in the card draw, but good players learn the more important power of leeching.  This is a solid game that plays in under an hour - right up there with Mykerinos.

I've played thousands of games... and I still really enjoy it. I find it very hard to teach to new players, especially if they have never seen a role selection game. Playing Puerto Rico first is probably the best way to prepare for this game. Once the symbology clicks and you know what cards are in the deck, the game is super enjoyable.

It is playable on Boardgamearena.com, which is where I play now.

I bought into the hype. I love the concept. I love the cards art work. I just want to love this game but do not. I play against an AI and get trashed.

Great game, but huge learning curve due to the learning of the icons once you understand this part of the game this is a very good game.  Hopefully the expansions bring more player interaction though.


****UPDATE 12/10/08******
Although I like this game a lot I have lowered my rating from an 8 to a 7 because even though I like the game I don't have enough interest to learn all of the icons on the cards nor want to learn how the different action cards affect your cards played on the table.

I always have someone else who knows the game to tell me how the action card affects my played cards on the table.

Only played AI thus far, and watched the video tutorial, but the icons and icons and more icons are counter-intuitive to me. Everyone says it's a better San Juan, a game I enjoy, so rating may go up if I can ever figure it out. Am I just too stupid for certain games?
Update: I like Glory to Rome and SJ a lot, so maybe I just don't like RftG.  So many people say that it took them awhile to appreciate it, so I remain open minded.

RATING: 9
Race for the Galaxy is very close to being a ten in my books. A truly excellent game in terms of sheer replayability and variety (when combined with the cards from its original three expansions; I never play without them, so I'm basically reviewing the expanded game rather than the base game to which this rating is attached). RftG has easily the best time-to-reward ratio of any game I've played.

It's the inevitable shortcomings of the luck-of-the-draw tableau building format that make it remain a 9/10. Even at its best, with tight two-player games, the fundamental mechanics simply can't carry it to the pinnacle of enjoyment that a 10/10 would require. There's just not enough game there to let it, even though all of it that IS there is nearly flawless.

Still, a must-buy for any hobbyist.

In the card game Race for the Galaxy, players build galactic civilizations by playing game cards in front of them that represent worlds or technical and social developments. Some worlds allow players to produce goods, which can be consumed later to gain either card draws or victory points when the appropriate technologies are available to them. These are mainly provided by the developments and worlds that are not able to produce, but the fancier production worlds also give these bonuses.

Really enjoy this card game. I've only played it a handful of times so far, but I can already see that there are depths of strategy to it that I haven't grasped yet. I really enjoy the decisions, though, the kind of "what am I going to discard so that I can do this?" descision, as in San Juan.

They're right. Learning the icons may take some time, and an specific phase (the consume phase) is confusing for some distracted minds (not me). So I find myself constantly explaining (repeating) the consume phase procedure to others. But I'm patient, and I gladly pay this price because this game is FUN!

My family loves it. It has the perfect amount of luck so they're allowed to beat me sometimes :p It plays perfectly with 2 players and above.

It does have low interaction between players (solitaire), but as with Puerto Rico, you have to take a look at your opponents' game and analize it if you want to be competitive and win.

The artwork is beautyful. I highly recommend this game.

I have played this probably 12-15 times, and only the last time did we play all of the rules correctly (I hope). Not that it is a hard game - the rules are relatively simple - just little things kept throwing us. 

Now that we have everything straight I hope to get more plays in before settling on a rating, but we have quite enjoyed it. It is too bad it took so many plays to get right. The sheen has worn off of many games by 15 plays.

I feel strange rating Race for the Galaxy.  On the one hand, it's a great game, with loads of replay value.  I find it fun and interesting.  HOWEVER, it is also wildly over-priced for what you get.  You spend $35, and basically get a deck of cards and some cardboard scoring chits.  I understand that there are a lot of up-front costs...artwork, cards, etc., but that doesn't change the fact that RftG is a bit too pricey.

UPDATE:  I'm moving RftG up to a 9.  I want to play it pretty much all the time.  I've taught it to a bunch of people, and it has been a big hit.  YES, I still think it's over-priced for the stuff you get, but I've enjoyed it more than pricier games, so I can't complain as loudly as before.  We'll see, but if Race holds up, it might end up as one of my few 10s.

UPDATE:  It's a 10.  My girlfriend and I play this almost every day, and always more than once.  We both can't get enough of Race, and that makes it a 10 in our book!

An excellent game. So many different ways to win. So many different strategies to try. The game is different every time and there is a great balance between trying to get the best score possible and trying to end the game before your opponent has a chance to build their score too high.

Looking forward to the expansions!!

Got them all. Love them for the most part. Now there are enough cards of each type to make different theme strategies viable, however, now there are so many cards that to find the one you want is almost impossible (and makes shuffling so much tougher!)

5.6.2008: San Juan++. I felt quite at home with the game, the cards and their combos were very CCG-like.

Deck building with a twist: you get the bonus but all players get to do the action you chose (speeding up play), planets can produce more cards or victory points, and the true victory is in card combinations. However, what planet you start or what major bonus card you draw determines you goal and playing style. More over, once you know your opponents, you know how each round is going to play out and it's all about the shuffle. Still, a reasonable game with good replay value.

BIG PLUS: strategy affects other players, relatively simple to learn
BIG MINUS: predictable opponents, strategies are limited

RATING: 7.5
My rating began at 8, went up to 8.5 and now up to 9.  This is an awesome game!  I can see this hitting 10 at some point.  There's a lot of gaming goodness in here!

If you use the initial starting hands (which I [i]highly[/i] recommend for your first few games) you have a choice of some pretty clear strategies.  Since playing without the starting hands, the strategy choices seem to be expanding, which is contrary to what I initially thought would happen.  The way the cards interact with one another and with your strategy is very subtle, something I feel San Juan lacks (there's like 2.5 strategies in San Juan).  The fact that the 6-point development cards give you in-game bonuses is sheer genius, and completely changes the nature of the game.  They drive your strategy (or they have the capability to do so).

Tactically this game is very rich, too.  Choosing which cards to discard can be a deliciously hard decision, much like in San Juan (but given the very wide variety of cards in Race for the Galaxy, it's that much more "fun").  Making the best with what you've got or adapting your strategy to what you're holding is part of the tactical decision-making needed each turn.

Finally, the multi-player solitaire feeling is not as prevalent in this as in San Juan, at least using the "advanced" 2-player version.  There's real angst in trying to figure out what your opponent(s) will choose for their action(s) as you try to decide on your own: do you go for the sure thing, try to compliment your guess at their choice, or will the bonus drive your decision?  Lovely stuff!

(P.S. after writing up this little review, I've changed my rating to a 9.5 -- it's that good!)

RATING: 10
Excellent game and I can really see the similarities to Puerto Rico when I play it. However, the way the game plays with the simultaneous role selection and the ordered phases of the roles is fantastic. There is a learning curve to the game but come on most of the games on this site require you to learn the intricacies of the game.

Is the game multi-player solitaire? No more so than Puerto Rico to me. Much like Puerto Rico you can look over the table to see what you opponents have going for them in their tableau and also see the number of cards in their hand. Based on that you can make a hunch as to what role they are selecting. Do you want to develop/settle? Is there anyone else at the table holding a lot of cards? If so it likely that player is going to call one of those actions and if you have no preference as which then choose a different type of action that you'd also like to get done this round. 

Can people help out their opponents? Sure they can. However, unlike Puerto Rico where they tend to help out the player to their left, in RftG they could help any other player at the table. For instance if someone isn't paying attention to cards in play someone could play out a development/settle action that would allow another player to get to his twelfth card and end the game. 

Okay, so I've compared it to PR because of the similarities how about the differences. In PR I feel that there are a few standard opening moves and several buildings that are far superior buys than others. In RftG I have not seen a standard opening move. You have to initially deal with what you're opening hand is and then modify your agenda as you receive more cards. In PR coins are currency while in RftG the cards in your hand are the currency so you must decide what you're planning on playing onto the table vs use as currency. And since you can only get 12 cards to the table you have to decide how important each card is to your objective. There are times where a card that looks cool just doesn't really fit in with your plans so walk away.

A deep, rich, rewarding game with plenty of decisions to make that plays in  30 minutes and leaves you with the desire to play just one more hand...amazing.

This game gets better and better. Played both multiplayer (best), against the robot (great) and with Keldon's AI (I just prefer playing with the physical cards, or else i might as well play a "real" computer game i think. Keldon's is great if you want to try out strategies). Such a great game in a small package. There is tons of tension and decisions have a great impact on how well you do. There is random elements with the cards, but luck plays a smaller factor that what appears after your first couple of games. Brilliant cardgame. I play with just the base game and Gathering Storm. tGS ads balance to the different roads to victory as well as adding the brilliant goals without adding anything fiddly (i'm looking at you expansion 2 and 3!!!) Looking forward to the Alien Expansion, it will hopefully get people to pay this game again :)

The complex symbology used to show the interactions between developments, worlds and actions is daunting on a first play. Once you get accustomed to it, though, the gameplay is quite enjoyable. Lots of different cards, lots of options.

EDIT: After futher play, I've marked it down a notch. I'm starting to feel that the game plays TOO quickly, which puts you somewhat at the mercy of the cards. Yes, experience will better inform you which cards to keep, but the game feels a little bit too much like a crapshoot at times. The end point is entirely arbitrary and there is no sense of developing towards something. Honestly, if I'm going to play a game of complex card interactions, Netrunner is more interesting, has a clear goal besides netting a bunch of points, and is way more immersive!

Bajo la apariencia de un juego de cartas futurista se esconde un buen juego con cierto gusto a juego de Civilizaciones, aunque es un juego de Gestión de recursos (bueno, en realidad no sé dónde ponerlo).

Mediante cartas se trata de ir desarrollando una especie de imperio, con el que tratas ganar puntos. Para ello cada jugador tiene cinco cartas que no forman parte de este imperio, sino que son las fases del juego. Cada uno decide en secreto al principio de la ronda qué fase va a jugar, lo cual le reportará unos beneficios. Es una mecánica muy parecida a la del Puerto Rico.

Un juego bastante interesante al que creo que le falta un poco de interacción más directa (poder atacar a tus rivales, por ejemplo), pero que seguramente es algo que se dejó para incluir en las ampliaciones.

The game seems overly complex for what it is -- a luck-based card game -- and frankly, I'd rather play San Juan or Dominion, where the cards are easier to understand and the game a bit more intuitive.  The only unique element here is the simultaneous rather than sequential role selection mechanism, which I would like to see incorporated into a meatier, less luck-oriented game.

Way better than San Juan due to variety of strategies.
Gathering storm expansion is a must. Great mechanics.
Abstract icons are easy to pick up & simply great !

Game design could be improved e.g. Hive or Mahjong tile w/ symbol imprints instead of "2 sets of cards" and maybe glass or plastic victory chips for the paper ones.

Military victory strategy seems to be inferior to others; could be "customized" with rebel...but still.
Takeover mechanism could be improved to introduce more interaction...

Other than that - perfect card game for multiple players or even two (w/advanced rules).

Wonderful card game based on San Juan, with a Sci-Fi theme.  The symbols take one or two plays to pick up, then they click.  Hand management and understanding the available strategies is essential to doing well.

"I think games like Outpost and Race for the Galaxy are very thematic and capture the mood of more thoughtful, less action oriented, styles of science fiction like Asimov and Clarke used to write: less interplanetary war, more scientific exploration.

I recently finished reading Fountains of Paradise and have been dying to get in a game of Outpost ever since."

Fantastic mechanics. People complain about the symbols but I found them intuitive and meant the tableau was comprehensible at a glance, rather than everyone leaning over each other to read their cards.

RATING: 6
The specific kind of player interaction here is a big drawback for me. Some people are on the edge of their seats trying to ride other people's role selections. I'm drumming my fingers. The increased interaction of the Puerto Rico role selection is far more engaging to me. Also, the "cards-as-money" mechanic means that you have to play in a zen-like state where you're open to multiple implementations of an overall strategy and completely unsure whether you'll ever get any specific card. I like to be a little more calculating about combinations in a game such as this. I initially thought this would be a blast because of the CCG roots, but there's only a sliver of attraction left in this for me.

The deepest game you can cram into 30 minutes.  I am absolutely stunned with the variety and depth.  This is the game that I originally thought San Juan was (until I got 50 plays in and discovered it was broken).

Update: Rating has dropped considerably since Dominion came out.  Not that it's similar to Dominion (it really isn't), but given the choice, I'd rather play Dominion 98 times out of 100.

This is a fun game, but the first play through is tough because of all the symbols that need to be recognized. The symbols are well designed, but you have a lot of cards in your hand that need to be scanned quickly. It is an economic game in which you play a card for one of five actions that you want to do: get cards, develop technology or settle a planet, both which involve playing a card face up in front of you, produce goods, and consume goods. So initially you build up the economy to produce goods which gives you more cards and then as the game goes along start producing or playing cards to give victory points. There are many different types of cards and the space sci-fi art on the cards is nicely done.

An excellent card management game with near unlimited replayability.  Gathering storm adds even more. I have yet to try the other expansions.

Tough to teach newcomers, but so worth it when they finally understand.

I disliked this game at first. Yet another card game. Limited interaction. An exercise in multi solo card optimisation.

I was unconvinced at other players reports of it being the best game. I listed why it couldn't possibly be the best game.

Then someone said - it's just a card game. But for the time it takes to play, you have a lot of replayability, a lot of depth and many ways to go about things.

Which is true. Taking it like that - a really short but dense game, it is very good indeed.

After sticking it with for many plays I actually enjoy this quite a bit now, and like trying to optimise for a better score whilst attempting to take advantage of the subtle interplay between players of selecting actions.

Cool stuff. Took a very long time for me to appreciate it though.

Only played the 2-player version, so rating may be unfair (and may go up).
My wife don't like this at all, while she loves PR and San Juan.
I like the idea of a more complex SJ, but my initial reaction is that the higher complexity doesn't marry well with the short game. It seems too random, which strategy will work.

Also I think this game has a high learning treashold due to the many icons you need to memorize (or constantly consult the player aid).

Having said that I understand why people love this game (played with the right competition)

I much prefer Race for the Galaxy of San Juan, but having now played Glory to Rome, Race for the Galaxy has become somewhat stale.  If you have never played this style of game before it will be a new and welcome experience.  A bit to isolated for my tastes.  Often players are in their own world, though future expansions correct this to a certain degree.

Quick and easy card drafting game, or though if it wasn't for the theme of space I'm not sure if I would have picked this one up. Both the simple mechanics and the iconograhy (which only takes a couple of games to get the grasp off) implements the theme of space exploration, expansion, exploitation in this game very well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Almost all of my playes are of the base game, or base plus first expansion. I would rate this a 10 but I've essentially stopped playing it. Part of the issue is that in the end this is a 2p game. You can play with more, but it does hurt the strategic elegance of the 2p experience. I don't have a partner of equal skill to play with (those of my friends who still play are much, much better than I am). It's hard to get 2p games to the table and when we do get a chance we usually reach for something epic. So I will leave this rated as a 9 for now.

---------------------------
This is pretty much the best game ever.  I can't recall being so eager to play a game.  It has loads of strategy, interesting decisions, hand management, and balanced diversity. This last point is probably where the game really shines, there are at least 4 distinct strategies and each plays very differently and has an equal chance of success. The balance in the game is mind boggling.

The only real criticism is the lack of interactivity between players, it feels a lot like multi-player solitaire much of the time. However there is heavy interaction in choosing actions, since all players have an option to perform the chosen action, especially in the production phase.  I'm assuming future expansions will address this issue, but to be frank it doesn't bother me very much, it is a very enjoyable game.

A truly excellent game. Taught myself to play using the solo game in the expansion.

**Update** Playing a little on the PC, trying not to overplay it!

I Like:
* Scratches that CCG Itch
* Role selection provides a deep level of strategy & low level tactics
* Lots of cards and viable ways to win with both expansions

I Dislike:
* So many wasted cardboad boxes!
* The takeover mechanic has yet to be used in 5-6 games i've played.
* The game is challenging to teach and it took me 3-4 full games before I started to have a good time.

So much like Korean "Go Stop", in that there are so many different ways to score points, with some cards able to score in different ways and thresholds for scoring, bonuses for sets, and on and on. The biggest difference being that in Go Stop, you can continue the game if you score the minimum needed first, to rack up more points, so it has a push-your-luck element as well, which is the 'go' part of the name. I actually think learning how to play the game is half the fun, although many people complain about the steep learning curve. A game with so many light bulb moments that you'll feel smarter just by playing!

I figured out why I don't like this game so much.   Its okay, but it just is plain too clumsy.   Too many different little parts of it and not real good flow.   Its also too dependent on luck.  I guess that is the nature of card games, but still it bothers me when luck is too big of a factor.   More importantly though, there is not enough interaction between players.

I'll play this game when others want to, but almost certainly will choose something else if there is a choice.

RATING: 9
A swift and solid (as a rock) card game.  The hieroglyphic icons take a little bit of getting used to, but a few hands should be enough to see you into understanding.  Really, this is a revised, lightly tweaked and very tight remake of Puerto Rico set in space; and that isn't a criticism!  Where RfTG really comes into its own is through the careful creation of synergy: "I play card X so card Y will score and enable a return on card Z etc."

If I owned one card game, it'd probably be this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
An excellent card game which--like DOMINION--has great CCG-like mechanics but isn't a CCG.  The theme is perfect for the mechanics as well--science fiction--& players determine, with cards, which phases of the game within a turn will be played.  The initial start for newbies is a little daunting (especially if you've never played a CCG) with all the symbols on the cards showing what the card can do (rather than having text explaining it), so one will find themselves looking at the players reference card a lot.  It is for this reason I gave it a "9" instead of a "10" due to a late "AH-HA!" experience.  But once you have that experience, it's full-tilt-boogie-card-flopping-fun!

RATING: 5
I think I'm done with this. My first impression was that despite the massively confusing symbols it was a game I would probably grow to love. So I gave it some more chances, and now I'm up to 5 plays. The symbols still being a pain might just be my own deficiency, but more problematic is that there's just no spark in this game, there's nothing but spinning the dials and hoping to out-guess your opponents. You can keep this bore, I'll take the simple elegance of San Juan or the chaotic fun of Glory to Rome.

This is one of the first games I bought when I really got into games again. I ended up trading it away because it never got played although I remember loving it. It faded away in my memory and I decided I didn't like it until a buddy of mine declared his love for it and he pulled it out. WOW! It's really good! After 300+ new games played since I got back into this hobby, this game is still one of the best!

Race for the Galaxy is my most played strategic card game. The theme and artwork are really cool, and I like the idea that Tom Lehmann has tried to create a universe to paste on this abstract game. This game offers endless replayability, especially after adding the expansions. The Gathering Storm increased the possibilities of the rules in the core set, and freshened it up without adding game-changing mechanics. Rebel vs Imperium changed a lot, and not for the better; it added a lot of agression, which doesn't work for me in this game. The Brink of War added an enterely new way of scoring points, which makes the game a lot harder, but definately rewards flexible play. This game plays quickly, it is very deep, and makes games such as Puerto Rico and San Juan redundant for me, because the role selection is the most exciting bit of these games. I mostly play this game as a 2P game, using the double role selection variant. I have yet to try out the drafting variant. I am also very curious to see how the new Alien Artifacts expansion will work out; hopefully it will provide some fresh air in a game that has been played to death by my friend and me. UPDATE: I used to rate this game a 9, but it's starting to decrease to a 7: still a great game, but because it is so low on player interaction, I'm enjoying it less than I used to. Also, I'm getting more convinced that this is a better game when only played with The Gathering Storm expansion.

Maybe its a result of playing with people who are more experienced at the game, or maybe it's that I don't understand the iconography near as well as I think I do - but this game just feels a mess to me.

The themes and ideas behind the game sound so interesting though, that I feel I need to give this another go with a group that is as inexperienced as I am.

Apr2012: Finally raised to a 9 after getting practice against the Keldon AI and now being able to play a decent game against experienced players. While it's still engine building, it's not of the potentially annoying Dominion type where ten effects are chained to lead to an eleventh. The 9 rating is with the first two expansions included. Stand-Alone, it's an 8 as strategies are a bit limited for experienced players.

My wife and I played it for the first time in about 1.5 hours.  The learning curve is a bit steep, mostly regarding the plethora of icons and their uses.  After a few rounds, it gets much easier to pick up.  I'm guessing a game could easily be played between 30-60 minutes as the game suggests once you have a few under your belt.  3 or 4 players would definitely make it more interesting.  Did I mention I lost 39-31?

Boring - sold it. Happily. It's such a shame because I love Sci-Fi but this has a lot of icons on it which become more important than the pictures on the cards. So the Sci-Fi flavour is lost. You might as well take out the pictures and just have a white background with symbols on the cards. That's why it's dull and boring.

I used to hate this game. The rules are needlessly confusing and the iconography is horrible (Can I get a crib sheet for the crib sheet?). This is not a game you should try to teach yourself how to play. Having someone who knows how to play the game makes learning it much easier. The game feels like it is trying too hard. San Juan, a very similar game in mechanics, works great: easy to teach, quick to play, and intuitive. However, what I like about RftG is that it has more options than San Juan. Once you get past the horribly written rules and the poor card design, you see that this game has lots of different strategies and different paths to victory. In the end, you have a well-thought out system that was poorly implemented. And I still enjoy playing it immensely. I have played 200+ games of RftG and still love it! However, both expansions are poorly done and not worth the money.

One of the few games we got just on a whim.  I knew a lot of people liked it here, but that it lost the Dominion vs. Race for the Galaxy battle here.  It turns out to be a great game.  Once I learned that it was first designed as a card version Puerto Rico I could see the similarities.  It is very interface intensive.  Meaning there are A LOT of icons that you have to learn before the game will just play smoothly.  Once you've learned the icon system it is a quick, fun game. 

It is another game that has little to no conflict with the other players, which makes for a great game with my wife.  If you want conflict you can get an expansion, which we have not done.

The game is fun, but only if you like luck-based games.  Once you know the cards and understand how they go together, it becomes who gets lucky with cards.  Ever had all those production worlds, but just couldn't draw a SINGLE 6-pointer while the other guy places EVERY rebel world in the deck?  Yeah, that's luck.

Number of players: 2-4

Components: (10)
The cards are wonderful quality and the VP tokens are thematic and functional.
  
Rules: (10)
The rules are written in a very accessible and pragmatic manner. 

Setup: (9)
It's a slight thing to have to keep the starting planets sorted, and a lesser thing to have to keep the action cards sorted. It's not horrible, though.

Area required to play: (9)
You'll need enough room for everyone to have about 12 cards in front of them, with enough room around those cards to have cards on top of them, but not covering all the information.
 
Fun: (10)
This is one of the best games that I have ever played.

Theme Integration / Mechanics: (9)
The theme is wonderful and works. I didn't notice, until the third time that I played, that I was playing a Euro. It is a little weird to have your hand of cards and also a hand of action cards. It's something that you soon grow used to (also, once you're familiar with the action cards, you don't have to hold them so much as you have to know which one you're ready to select).

Replay Value: (10)
I've yet to play with any expansions and I already feel like I could never grow bored with this game. I can only imagine what will happen when I add more variety into the mix.

Storage: (10)
Get a deck box and you're set.

Accessibility: (5)
This game really isn't crazy complex, but those symbols really turn a lot of people off. I love them and think that it's perfectly functional and becomes second nature after the first game.

Over-All/Bonuses/Biases: (+10)
This is one of my absolute favorites and I don't foresee this ever changing.

It's a nice quick learn as far as the iconography goes, but a little lower on the interaction than perhaps would be the case in other games. Still, it's fun and not a super-lengthy game, which makes it great for a filler.

I love the theme on this one and while the learning curve was a bit steep at first with the wierd iconography, it was worth slogging through. Now my only complaint is that i find it tough to use other than military strategies with New Sparta as my starting planet. And i HATE Alpha Centauri. what a worthless starting home world. I hope The Gathering Storm adds some interesting twists with the new starting planets.

RATING: 8
I'm not a fan of the science fiction theme, and I don't really even like San Juan all that much.  But this game intrigues me.  I like how quickly it plays and there seems to be many different paths to victory.  The multiplayer solitaire criticism doesn't really bother me all that much since the game is so fast - I can understand why people say this, but the guessing game of who picked what role is interaction enough for me.  One minor problem is that it is difficult to make sure that your opponents aren't cheating or playing wrong, but that's more of a group problem than a game problem - it shouldn't be a factor for me.  I hope to find some people with whom to play regularly, as I can see how this game will open up with repeated play.

I don't find the graphic design of the base game as confusing as some.  A game I'm certainly not a master in but always willing to give it at try. One of these days I'll master a way to win with a production strategy...but luck always seems to steer me towards a quick military victory. 

The expansions, though, are where I tend to start losing track of what the heck is going on.

I like the competition that doesn't feel like competition aspect of the game.  You have to know the game to really appreciate its various facets, and it only plays fast once you've got those down.  It's great for attracting people who might not otherwise play board/card games.  Like many card games for gaming veterans, of course, it either grabs you or it doesn't. In the competition among hundreds of games for scarce playing time, I would have to be strongly petitioned to play again.

A very clever card game with interesting mechanics: the five phases complement each other amazingly well. I like how you select the phase simultaneously and everyone has to do that phase. This certainly gives a twist to the game in that you do not only decide for yourself but for the other players as well. 
One has to prepare for a steep learning curb when learning the game, but it seems, if you persevere it will be rewarding. It took me a while to figure out how the different phases work together, let alone the symbols. 
Playing the game on the computer and watching one or two tutorials can help a lot.
Rating will depend on future plays with my family.

I found it too solitaire on my first few plays. I would like to try more.
UPDATE: It's pretty dull and the luck factor is significant. There is too much buy in both in iconography and monetarily to then decide via a card draw whether you're soaring into the lead or wallowing in dull inefficiency. I'm disappointed in RGG, but then their treatment of Dominion expansions (huge box, massive overpricing) is just further proof of a deterioration in attitude to customer needs.

Game rules are not difficult. However it one game is not enough to understand what is happening and what is related to what. Symbols are also quite clear even though there are quite a lot of them. The most important thing in the game is to adapt your game to the cards you have in the hand, because the strategy, you thought of having in mind the starting world, might not work well. The game certainly has enough depth.

Žaidimo taisyklės nesudėtingos. Bet perprasti, kas vyksta ir kas su kuo susiję, tikrai reikia ne vieno žaidimo. Simboliai taip pat pakankamai pakankamai aiškūs, nors jų ir yra nemažai. Svarbiausia prisitaikyti ir gerai panaudoti tas kortas, kurios tuo metu turi rankoje, nes pagal startinį pasaulį sugalvota strategija gali ir neveikti. Žaidimas tikrai pakankamai gilus.

It took me a few plays of this game to wrap my brain around this game (even though I have played San Juan before).  The first play tends to be quite overwhelming, but after a couple of plays, everything makes sense and then you start to appreciate all the different cards and different possible combinations.  I suggest that you give yourself 2-3 games before deciding if you don't like it because it takes a couple of plays to get over the initial bewildering possibilities.

In the first few games, it seems like people tend to build a lot of small cards and end the game without much consumption or 6-developments.  At this point, the military strategy seems to be king.  Then someone will start produce-consume 2x and then the consume strategy for VP seems to be king.  Unlike San Juan, the 6 developments are quite powerful and should be built early in the game since they garner you with nice bonuses.

It looks like with experience, the game will last around 30 minutes.  There is quite a lot of depth for such a quick playing time.

For a long time I wasn't fascinated about the idea of playing this because it was so widely compared to San Juan. When finally playing I liked it as so many others have also liked. Good scifi art and lots of puzzling symbols give the game a CCG feel, but as a process it actually reminded me most of Catan Card Game. Winning doesn't feel too important here, it's rather about your own top scores. That unfortunately also turns the game towards the direction of solitaire. I also suggest using a maximum of one expansion when playing. My main problem with RftG is that games often tend to end when the engines are running and it starts to get interesting.

Mostly play the game with 2 players, but it's a very different beast with more. The shared actions mean that a 3-5 player game has some push your luck as to which actions will be available, and trying not to benefit your opponents with your selection: it's a much more interesting game IMO. With 2, the game is very tactical, and results are more luck-based as you take away much of the strategy behind action selection.

This was easy to pick up and I think the iconography is very straight forward.  I could explain this to anyone without difficulty.  I really wouldn't predict that I like this game.  It really doesn't have a ton of strategy (your roll you choose mostly depends on the # and type of cards in your hand), everyone benefits from your action (something that bothered me in Eminent Domain), and it is quite multi-player solitaire.  You can't attack your neighbor and nothing I did affected him at all.  And yet I really enjoyed it.  The theme is so immersive for me.  I think the artwork is partially responsible for this; it is quite possibly my favorite artwork in a card game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Pretty underwhelmed after 2 plays.  There are some neat ideas in the game, and despite the built-in randomness associated with the card drawing, it does appear possible to cobble together combos of various worlds and developments in a way that is interesting and satisfying.  But the game is over much too quickly -- just as you feel like you're getting some traction and starting to get your "engine" up and running, poof!, it's one or two turns away from the game end.  The name is quite apt, but hurried nature of the gameplay jars with the theme of explore/develop/produce.  The game seems to have a moderate learning curve with respect to playability -- you are looking at so many cards with so many different effects and trying to figure out which cards to keep and which to discard.  Presumably this gets easier with repeat plays but the range of effects makes this daunting initially.  It's frustrating when figuring out what your options are is more difficult and time consuming than deciding which option is your best.

Tableau builder with the same design starting point as San Juan. I found it much more accessible, and the flavour is well done. That still doesn't make me a fan of tableau builders, I'm afraid. Gameplay is solitaire-ish; you can pay some attention to what everyone else is doing but this slows the game down, and in essence you're racing an unpredictable clock. Pursuing a military strategy is a crapshoot since your progression can be completely shut down for several turns. Production should be more reliable, though there are still obvious push-your-luck aspects. I can recommend everyone to try mrkeldon's computer version (with borgemik's patch), but [-]it wouldn't be my first choice[/-] I would never request it with other people.

Rated after one two player play with my 13 year old brother in which we got a few rules wrong, but nothing major.

This game seems really fun. Definitely overwhelming at first with the number of icons, but everything fits together very cleverly and the variety of strategies to achieve victory seems very wide. I am looking forward to figuring out this game!

That said, I suspect after 50 plays or so one might find the strategy becomes clear and knowledge of the cards makes replayability less interesting. A little more interactivity would be nice: perhaps the expansions provide this.

I think this will play 45 minutes easily as we get better.

Uno de los mejores juegos de desarrollo que he jugado. Las reglas parecen complicadas en un principio, pero una vez que aprendes la mecanica resulta rapido y sencillo de jugar. Eso si, con muchisimas posibilidades estrategicas y muchas formas de conseguir la victoria.
La caja incial presenta una reglas muy interesantes y bien balanceadas. Creo que el factor suerte es poco, casi todo el peso cae sobre la estrategia elegida y sobre la eleccion de las acciones que juegas en cada turno. Segun elijas que fase jugar en cada momento , daras un paso hacia la victoria o hacia el desastre. 
Esto lo hace un juego complicado de dominar, pero muy interesante. Cada partida es diferente, sobre todo si utilizas las expansiones que abren muchisimas nuevas estrategias y posibilidades.
Un gran juego de con un balance perfecto entre las cartas que permiten a cualquiera ganar la partida siguiendo la estrategia que elija.

Someday I'll actually beat my co-worker. This is a fantastic lunchtime, 2-player game that we have down to 45 minutes. I am continually learning and/or recognizing strategies and card combinations that keep this card game satisfying for me. Several times we both thought I had my opponent beat only to have him pull ahead in the last round or two with some insightful combination or clever play based on the role selections. It's just a cool game to play.

[10/1/09: Thought about giving this a 9, but I dinged this back down by a point because there are times when you just can't get the cards you need, especially when you're playing with one of the groups that're shoehorned into a particular strategy. Alpha Centauri and New Earth can be absolutely obnoxious to play as sometimes, if you just don't draw the Rare cards. It's still a great game, and the AI available is fantastic for practice.]

WAY better than Dominion due to its interestingly variable paths to victory - if the right cards came up early on, I'd imagine even the New Spartans I played as my first time might be shoehorned into a produce-and-trade veep strategy. 

I won the only game I've played, most likely due to luck. It's fun, but I have to ding it a few steps for its total lack of interaction. I was told that an expansion's in the works that'll allow for offensives, and while I can imagine that without constraints, this will just turn into a hammer-the-leader mechanism or something that hands the victory to the New Spartans, I'm sure there'll be some balancing in there. Anyway, I'd love to play this more; it's not too long, and you can get creative with your strategy.

RftG does intensify my regret at having blown $30 on Dominion.

Great little game but my biggest gripe is that I feel the starting planet can really have a big impact on who wins the game.  I haven't played the expansions but i know the reviews are very mixed.  

This game made a huge splash when it first came out but it does not seem to have been able to hold its own with the wave of new games that have come out since.  I have't seen it played in my local game shop in over a year.

This may fall down among my ranked games in the near future just because I never play it.

*sleeved* played this game to death. It been a 2 year since we last played and I'm thinking of getting back into this. I respect it for its contribution to tableau building games.

Great game... just a little dated.

RATING: 9
This game is brilliant.  In a matter of 12 cards, you try to build a point-grabbing engine; but of all the games similar to Race, none of them do it with this much subtlety and nuance.

However, that also means there's a high barrier to entry.  Figuring out how to play Race can be like learning a new language, and getting burned by constant losses.  It's difficult to introduce this game to people, and that makes it imperfect for me.

But once you're in, the game rewards you with seemingly limitless variations of its puzzle, and it's so quick and dynamic that I can't help but keep trying to solve it again and again.  For the initiated, this game is a true modern classic.

I really like this game.  I taught my wife and now that she's over the learning curve she likes it a lot as well.

Sometimes I wish it wasn't a race because I just want to keep building but I know there are other space empire games out there to scratch that itch.

Based on 100+ plays (most including the expansion).  The iconography isn't that bad, though it is probably tricky enough to deter my casual gaming friends.

2014-02-14 - Great game! I'm still only playing with base set and I'm still getting know this game. Lot of ways to victory and you need to hurry. It's a race after all.

It's such a struggle to get the hang of at first, but once you have it down, Race is such a fun game.  I love the impossible decisions that come when you need to sacrifice a card.  The "phases" mechanic makes it unique and not just a deck-builder of sorts; planning which phase card to play is a delicate dance every time.

Race has been accused of being a multiplayer solitaire game, which isn't totally unfair.  Your opponent's choices won't affect your plans much at all.  Personally, I don't mind that in a game.  The fun for me comes from analyzing my position and deciding what to pursue, not from "gotcha" moves against others.

wow, after round about 40 games vs. Keldon-Ai and 4 human oppenents I cannot admire this design enough. I think it cannot get simpler and have these crispy tough decisions than in RftG - completely blown away, this might be my holy grail game and this is just the core game. There is a ton of expansions to be explored,yay :)

Only fly in the ointment is really the german availability of this gem: Game is abundant, but because no longer in printing people try to make a fortune with this little card game - I've seen prices as high as 180€, that is almost gloomhaven and feast of odin combined...tz..tz.

I once had an unfavorable out look on this (claiming I wouldn't want to play it again).  However, it stuck in my head long enough that it just itched, so I bought it.  Happily, buying it and playing frequently hasn't alleviated the itch much.

I haven't played it a lot compared to others, but I have played it a lot compared to other games in my collection (at least 20 times over the course of the first month of owning it).

I look forward to playing it, and each game opens up new strategies and results.  Between two equal players there is a good amount of luck involved (what cards are you going to draw) but it does allow to adapt based on what you do draw.  Like many great games, this one sticks in my head and after every game begs to be played again.

I am undecided how I feel about this game. I won the first game kind of off having good cards and an obvious/easy strategy fall in my lap. Then 2nd game tried a brown strategy and was thoroughly beaten as I didn't really play it correctly. I suspect it will require a few more plays before I can pass final judgement.

Rating based on solitaire play to learn rules.

A huge upgrade to San Juan.  Similar game play with a much better theme and many more strategies.  I love how the different "6" cards can impact the development path you can choose to take.  This rating could go way up with FTF play.

I also don't understand the  many criticisms of the symbols on the cards.  It isn't that difficult to learn what the symbols and colors mean, and the player aid card is a great help.

The game is very similar to Glory to Rome.  It takes awhile to learn how the cards function and all the options available.  I could see it taking several games before feeling like I really know what I'm doing.  Again, very similar to my experience with Glory to Rome.  But I think Glory to Rome is much better.  I'm not sure I'll like the aspect of guessing what your opponents will play so you can get the free ride.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great game. The need to adapt your strategy to account for the cards you get - and also your opponents strategy - makes this game infinitely replayable. The expansions add some interesting mechanics and interactions, and are definitely worthwhile. 

I really like the drafting variants as well. I would probably rate them a little higher.

For now, this game is not as good or, specifically, accessible as San Juan, so I would rather play the latter.  I'll keep trying with Race and I'm sure it will grow on me, especially with all the expansions.
*Edit* It hasn't really grown on me.  I still strongly prefer Glory to Rome or San Juan.
**Edit** San Juan is accessible, but too dry and boring, so I'm upping my rating of Race to show that I now prefer it, although I strongly prefer to play Glory to Rome over Race.

I've never liked a game as much as Race. Variety while retaining balance is one of my top criteria for liking a game, and this delivers. The years spent playtesting really show through.
Don't believe those who'll tell you 2-player is the best way to play: it'll do if you're lacking players and don't have anything better to play, but a lot of the interesting tempo manipulation and mindgames are lost.

Excellent follow-on game to San Juan. Up to four players gather resources and take control of planets. The first player to get twelve cards (planets, technology, etc) on the table (as in San Juan) or when the bank empties, ends the game. Then total up the VPs and declare a winner. Although the mechanics are similar to San Juan, there is a lot more here. The cards contain tons of symbols that must be decoded. They are in the manual, but you have to do a lot of hunting to find them.I can't wait for the expansions! Rumor has it that two expansions were delivered to Rio Grande along with the final version of the game. I fully expect the base game to sell out pretty quickly.

RATING: 3
Played only once (edit: twice now).  I'm sorry, but I was extremely irritated by it.  It is gratuitously overcomplicated; there is no "elegance" to its design.  It's hard to imagine the designer actually having rejected any of his clever ideas for strangely complex cards he could add to the game.  There are a great many similarities to San Juan, but in that game, the number of distinct cards is reined in and their functions are more natural/fundamental, which means you can spend your time thinking on the next level -- about how various combinations of these cards will help your particular situation.  But here with RFTG you have a gigantic mess of specialized functions that feel very contrived.

I think this game appeals mainly to the type of gamer that wants to spend hours studying a game and memorizing all the cards and what they do, so that they can then use their superior knowledge to win games they play against the uninitiated.  I'll pass...

Update: I actually wanted to play it again. And I tried really hard to like it this time. But it still sucked.

Quick playing time: check.

Fun: hmm, where did I put the fun?

I haven't enjoyed playing this one yet. I am trying. I think I can pretty much follow the iconography at this point. But I haven't been able to find a way to have a good time playing.

It doesn't help that I play badly and can't, for example, figure out how to get a trade-consume engine going.

It also doesn't help that the early draws usually seem to push you into a strategy, and if later draws don't support that strategy, you lose. The game isn't long enough to change focus partway through.

Much later, I have finally tried this.  I can see there is a lot here.  San Juan on steroids.  But it is not for me.  Not a knock on the game, I can see how it might rate extremely high for some.

The game designer in me just cannot forgive a design with so much iconography.  Yeah you've heard it before and you still insist all those new players are following along just fine.  Well they aren't and they are just too embarrassed to say so.  The base game is fine otherwise but a few of the expansions are some of the biggest disasters I've seen.  I cringe every time I read of someone being suggested this game as one of the first games to introduce their wife to the new wide world of gaming.  It's like RFTG fans are living in a bubble or something.  Amongst a more seasoned steady group of regular gamers I get why this game could be a hit (a few expansions aside).

First time playing left me unimpressed. There are many different cards with different roles. Many of the icons were difficult to decipher, and this led to me making a few mistakes that cost a lot of time and VP. All of this comes from first-time play, and if I play again will probably be less confused and like it more. Look for the rating to go up if that happens - this game has potential.

Iconography was indeed quite confusing but after few games it got better. However, I was still struggling playing this game with a good strategy. Overall, it was a great blast playing this game. I felt like this is somewhat similar to Puerto Rico which is a great thing.

:star::star::star::star::star::star::star::star::star::star:  (15 plays November 2017)
I forgot the iconography so had to go through the manual one more time but it came back quite quickly. Getting better at strategy now and started enjoying this a lot. A very well designed deck building system. Love to play dozens more.

:star::star::star::star::star::star::star::star::nostar::nostar:  (20 plays November 2017)
Played about 10 games in few days. I think there are still a lot to learn more on strategy in this game. However, it gets tiny bit dryer. Perhaps it is because I played little too many times in few days. I will give it a shot later.

:star::star::star::star::star::star::star::star::star::nostar:  (30 plays November 2017)
I played 20 games in this month and I really enjoyed every single game. True the iconography was bit hard to understand at the beginning but once I understand their meanings and actions it became a nature. This game definitely deserves all the high ratings.

RATING: 7
Includes the Expansions:
Race for the Galaxy: Alien Artifacts (English first edition) (2013)
Race for the Galaxy: The Gathering Storm (English first edition) (2008)

Rating after one play with the Alien Artifacts expansion. The production value is great, for such a simple card game. The artwork on the cards is truly evocative of their different names and abilities. Like Fleet, you are building a point-scoring engine by adding cards to your tableau. However, unlike Fleet, you have no way to interfere with the plans of your opponents. Instead of an auction mechanic, RftG employs role selection. This is just enough to keep you paying attention to what everyone is doing, but not enough to really give you an impact on what they do. I would say that it's even one step removed from card drafting as an interactive element. That said, RftG plays quickly, and once you get the hang of the five actions you can get in a truly strategic game in around 30-45 minutes. The box suggests it for ages 12 and up, and I'd say that's about right. My 12 year-old could play it, but was frustrated at times and needed some help. Would be rated higher, but it is only really great as a two-player game.

Replaced by Roll for the Galaxy.

RATING: 10
Incredible game, I've played 100+ games of this and I can't wait to play some more! Finally a game that uses randomness as a way to change how it is played each time and not simply destroy any kind of strategy. Lots of different strategies, I'm still amazed to find some different ways to win, even after all the games I've played. Each turn, you have critical choices to make and they will deeply affect the outcome.

It's a game that takes time to master, I would say that only after 10-15 games you start to feel some of the strategy involved. The symbol system can annoy new players but it isn't that bad really. Without a doubt the game with the best bang for the money I have in my collection.

Nice upgrade from San Juan, though it is much harder to tell how each card is going to help you and what type of strategy to take. The computer version is buggy, not allowing you to take actions that were selected or something like that.
Scored 87 points once in a 4-player game with the first 2 expansions. Had 16 military and had the level 6 dev. card that gives a point per military. Also ended with 16 cards in my tableau, the double settlement dev. and as many military planets as I could lay 2 at a time.

Several dozen games, mostly 2players, few with expansions.
Great concept for a boardgame, after getting to know meaning and effects of symbols and actions it plays like a blast. One of these easy to learn hard to master games with a lot of skill and experience involved despite using only cards and fairly basic mechanics. Best suited for 2, although still enjoyable but a little different for more.

So the iconography is very heavy which is overcome mostly after your first play. If you play this for the first time, make sure to repeat a game right after. The game really clicks on the second play and i'm sure it will get even better with multiple plays. I'm lloking forward to it.

Pierwsza. Podobno trudna bo wiele ikonek iwogóle ;) Bardzo, bardzo dobra gra. Niestety wymaga trochę wysiłku w poznaniu jej. Jednak po zrozumieniu ikonografii i zasad to mechanika gry wydaje się prosta jak budowa cepa - choć instrukcja temu przeczy. Wzorzec dla zwrotu "easy to learn, hand to master" trochę jak w przypadku szachów nie tak trudno się nauczyć ruchów a bardzo trudno zostać mistrzem. Mnogość różnych strategii i dróg zwycięstwa. Dla dobrze znających grę bardzo krótkie partie. Wymaga kombinowania i promuje znających karty. Masa ludzi uwielbia tę grę, wielu gra na komputerze w wersję ze sztuczną inteligencją lub z innymi online, wyszła na androida wersja beta (ang). GFP a obecnie GF przebąkiwała że chce ją wydać po polsku ale ostatnio przycichło.
Do podstawowej części są jeszcze trzy dodatki i razem tak naprawdę tworzą jedną już dosyć skomplikowaną grę (Arc 1)(pewnie dlatego została podzielona na cztery by gracze ją strawili). Oprócz tego jest jeszcze Arc 2 i Arc 3 obie są jakby innymi grami ale obie korzystają z tej samej podstawki dodając inny zestaw kart i nieco innych zasad. Arc 2 - Alien Artifakt - dodatkowo tworzy się modułową planszę w której wyszukuje się artefaktów obcych, Arc 3 - Xeno Invasion - oprócz gry przeciwko drugiemu graczowi jest  jeszcze chyba jakaś semikooperacja czy coś, by walczyć z kosmitami. Kart z różnych Arc nie można mieszać.

Multiple action options each turn combined with so many card combinations and multiple uses per card make for interesting and difficult decisions on every single turn and a huge variety of viable strategies and tactics.

Somewhat disappointed in this card game, but have only played the 2 player version. Currently hoping that the 3-4 player games are a lot more intriguing. Great idea. Mechanics are solid. For being as cheap as it is, must buy for any enthusiast. So far this has been the most hyped card game that I have found to be rather flat for what it offers. Wonder if any of the expansions would add more to the game. As is, I'd rather play San Juan.

I recommend playing several games back to back to become familiar with the icons. Once you get the down, the game play can be fast and furious. Not much interaction among players, but you can often figure out what action they may play and use it to your advantage. For card games, this ranks below GtR but similar to Dominion.

2-4 (1-5 с дополнением)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Race for the Galaxy is a great example of how to craft a solid game based on snowball economies and optimization: add extensive doses of deduction.

Each turn players simultaneously and secretly choose an action. All players have access to the same pool of actions, and the one who picks each of them perform it with a bonus, but the rest of the players will be able to perform it too. Actions which aren't picked by any player are skipped for that round. This forces players to create efficient engines which not only run on their own, but also can benefit from the other player's actions, while simultaneously benefiting their opponents as little as possible. Players not only work with their own engine in their heads: they must keep everyone else's engine in mind.

This makes most interactions incredibly subtle and indirect, as there is no way of directly affecting your opponents. Yet it's not a "multiplayer solitaire", as truly efficient play requires extensive deduction.

The game's biggest flaw is its learning curve, which is stupidly high: you need to be very familiar with the deck. Multiple plays are required, as it's impossible to play without having a general idea of what you can draw. And while it's easy for a newbie to see an efficient combination once in action, the game mechanisms obscure what other players do. This is due to the fact cards can be either built or used as currency, and all discards are made face down. This means newbies can't truly analyse what veterans are doing, as they simply see the results.

Newbies are exposed to a tremendous overload of information. Thankfully, once all players are familiar with the game, it flows super fast. A game with newbies can easily last an hour or longer but, once all players are familiar with it, games can be consistently finished in twenty minutes or less.

After ~10 plays, added in The Gathering Storm, which I think is required to complete the base game as the few cards it adds really balance out the strategies that were previously under-represented (military, green, yellow).  It doesn't bloat the deck either, which is a big plus.

Simply amazing. Love the possibilities for different strategies and the feeling of some sort of space opera - if you can get into the theme, you will have fun describing how your empire is growing to your fellows. Only thing that doesn't make me rate this 10 anymore: The new military rules of the second expansion feel to complicate and artificial for this elegant game. They don't give the feeling of a real interaction but are more annoying.

One of the best games I own. Strategic, fun, tense--it hits all the right notes. Especially like the mechanic that cards double as both payment and actions as well. Even though it's tableau building, doesn't feel too much like multiplayer solitaire (though it does a little), as you rely on others to take actions.

Better than Roll for the Galaxy, but not as good as San Juan. It feels a bit solitaire as I can do most everything I want in a two player game without the other player really affecting any of my plans. My biggest gripe with it is not the games fault really, but I just seem to have a lot of trouble enjoying space themed games. Still a good game and the iconography is not nearly as complicated as most reviewers made it out to be. I tought my "semi"-gamer wife to play it in under ten minutes and had no problems after that.

Clear to see why this is rated so highly. 

However it is clearly lacking in interaction & theme. It does manage to make some of that back by being so quick and 'smart'. I don't know if it will ever be a game i love but it's nice to have and fills its spot very nicely.

Another game that I am slow to bring to the table yet love to play when I do. Building a space empire faster than your friend's space empire can be quite stressful though. Typically, I'm not a fan of these multiplayer solitaire games (always ending in, "Look what I made!"), this one feels good, regardless. The fact that each time you Explore you have to make hard decisions is draining and either leads in feeling like a genius when it fits into your engine or an idiot when you have a card on your plateau that has no benefit to you.

You either love it or hate it.   I like it, but I find myself no longer looking at a space theme but rather just focusing on the numbers. 

No elimination of players.  Everyone has the same capabilites until the end. 

Casual gamers and some advanced gamers will have a hard feeling they are "colonizing" a galaxy with cards. 

Not for a casual. I do not feel like I am colonizing a system as I am merely racking up numbers. 

Toss up between this and Glory to Rome.  

I would actually most likely compare Race for the Galaxy's interaction to that of Gates of Loyang.

My thoughts on this peculiar bird:
*Expensive for the pack of cards and a few counters you get.
*Player interaction is quite limited.
*Enjoyable for players who do not like direct confrontation.
*Play mechanics and resource management are smooth and well-designed.

This thing has a steep learning curve, and rewards knowing the deck by heart (yes, even with the three expansions you better know what cards are in there...)

Race for the Galaxy is a geek's game, requiring quite a bit of thought and time investment to learn. Basically, it's most suited for mathematically minded adults; my 15-year old brother calls it 'Rape for the Galaxy' and will go nowhere near it.

It is a no-no for new gamers and grandma.

The iconography is initially very confusing however the game mechanics are simple and fun to play. A 4 player game takes around 60mins and player interaction is better than expected. The game isn't too head wrecking either so you don't feel mentally drained afterwards. I'd rate it higher if the icons were easier to follow.

Don't attempt the drafting method, it would take as long to draft as to play as every card would entail AP.

Rule clarifications:
1) Stacking powers. Any '+' or '-' ability stacks, so you could have an explore of +10 cards to pick up for instance. This also applies to a single Trade. For Consume however, there isn't a plus/minus symbol so the powers don't stack.
2) If multiple players chose the same card, the action happens once.
3) If any player chooses Trade/Consume, ALL players MUST Consume using ALL of their Consume abilities if possible, The players determine the order of Consumption as benefits them most.
4) 2xConsume only applies to VPs, specified in the manual.

I really enjoy this one -- I think it takes all of the good elements of Puerto Rico, adds a much cooler theme and artwork (who doesn't get a thrill at picking up references such as "Spice World" or the nods to David Brin's "Uplift" series?), and does a much better job of getting across the feeling to every player of building up a galactic empire.

UPDATE: Having now played with goals, it's REALLY hard to go back.  I first played with goals on the Genie server, and had to go buy Gathering Storm once I realized how much it adds to the game -- higher interactivity (direct competition for the same goals) and your galactic empire has a purpose.

The iconography is just terrible and doesn't even do its job: the cards still need a lot of text, and the one thing that actually *needs* recognisable icons - the actions - are instead indicated with meaningless Roman numerals. That is just poor design people. The idea of using complex iconography is not the problem, but the execution is.

This was getting SOO much hype a little while back, probably too much. It is very much a refined space version of San Juan. My only problem with it so far is it seems whomever starts with the rebel land almost always wins. There is so much benefit to gaining a strong military bases and then build upon that. Others skip by it at the beginning of the game because they have no military power so you get a pretty strong leg up. I may be missing a good opposing strategy, but that's what I see so far. (aside from that, it's quite fun).

Very good card game space themed .In RftG you have to develope your space civilizatin by conquering planets,produce on them, develope improvement,and commerce.
It's fast but funny and very replayable ,similar to Puerto Rico and his card verion San Juan but a little more complex than the last one.The only thing is that tere isn't direct interaction,the only interaction is that roles played by you will be played without the benefit even by other players so you have to try to predict what other players could play in order to play a perfect turn.

A lot of strategies are possible and expansions add more and more.

An okay filler that I don't mind playing. I think I'm amazingly burnt out on most of the mechanics and gameplay from my days as an obsesseive CCG/TCG player. Not sure I understand all the excitement that it's producing considering most of the 90s was spent creating collectible knock-offs that used the same thing.

A good game taht I feared for a while.  I think it sat on our shelves for months.  We would read it and it seemed overwhelming.  But once you play it through it starts making sense.  It makes me think of a deck building game where you basically make a "Machine" and hope it can produce faster than your opponents.  Play the first time with two people and figure it out.  Let the first game be a practice.  You will do something wrong with the phases etc, but after a round, you will start catching on.  Its just intimidating at first.  Cleaver game, I will play in many times in the months to come.  Now I just have to figure out Puerto Rico.:)

Its alright I suppose, but I felt like I was playing a clunkier version of San Juan.

The comments on vandemonium's [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/31418]Games I lost this weekend[/url] list make me curious about this.

[b]Update 2008-06-28:[/b] after trying it (a 3-player game with two experienced players--klellingson & his son), I thought it was "OK," but not my kind of thing.  We played fast, with only a little inspection of what the other guys were doing (at least on my part), so it really was like the multi-player solitaire which people complain about.  Not bad, but not the kind of thing I would ever play with anyone I know.

[b]Update 2010-07-08[/b] (2 years later): I was wrong.  Dan got me this for my birthday a couple months ago, and we--and by "we" I mean "almost everyone I know"--have been playing the heck out of this.  I don't understand why we like it, but we do.  (Ray won't like it.)

[b]Update 2011-02-24:[/b] I may as well make this a 10.  Liking the same thing everyone else likes just rubs me the wrong way, but almost everyone loves this game, from Hellhammer (age 7) on up.  I think it's heavily luck-based, but we'll have nights where the same person will win five games in a row.  The difference between how much I thought we would like this, and how much we actually like this, proves I'm not that good at predicting what games we'll like.

:star: :star: :star: :star: :star: [b]Update 2017-03-22:[/b] after [i]literally thousands[/i] of plays with every combination of expansions, I'm [i]finally[/i] kind of burned out on this, so dropping it to a 6 ("well... OK, I'll play this").  No matter how you measure it, though, this game has been [b]my best dollars-per-hour-of-fun[/b] of [i]all time.[/i]  It's a goddamn luckfest, but it gives the all-important [i]illusion[/i] of meaningful choice.  If you haven't played this, play it.  If you've played this once or twice & didn't like it, play it again.  It's a great game, and if you don't like it, [i]you[/i] are the problem.

Quick engine builder with DEPTH. It isn't that difficult at all once you get the hang of it. Currently couldn't imagine playing without at least Gathering Storm and RvsI though. Add RvsI (and BoW) and it's a 10 for me.

Update: My gaming tastes seem to be shifting away from economic snowballs, but I still enjoy RFTG (with expansions) very much, because it delivers the best bits of the genre in 20 minutes, with a touch of double-guessing and bluff.

This game seemed like a more complex (and prettier) San Juan, so I will compare it to San Juan.

The more complicated rules allow for more tactical decisions, and the space exploration theme is always a good one.

However, this game suffers the exact same flaws as San Juan: the randomness of the cards that wind up in your hand can ultimately make or break your chances of victory, and there is almost exactly NO player interaction--it's very much like a multi-player solitaire (military ratings are only used for conquering planets that can't be colonized normally, NOT for battling other players!). I'm told that at least one expansion makes the game more interactive between players, so that will really be a good thing.

Great game that plays well for 2 but scales up well to 4 as well.  The cheat sheets can be intimidating but it's because they show all of the various combinations of symbols.  It all makes sense & the cheat sheets don't have to be explained in detail when teaching the game.

Familiarity with the cards makes the game more enjoyable.  Subsequent plays make the game even more fun.  It's kind of like playing a board game made out of cards.

The base set doesn't have much player interaction.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The game is reasonably easy to pick up, depending on the way it's taught.  However, the particulars of the cards available in the game can significantly influence how well a player scores, in a way that new players may not be aware except through luck of the draw (e.g., drawing a card that happens to work well with other cards drawn, as opposed to planning for one of the cards known to work well with what you have).

As player skill improves across the game, so does the opportunity for strategy.  I really enjoy the advanced two-player game for the added control.  The expansion cards further balance the game, and the homeworld-choosing option helps as well.  I think some of the goals throw more randomness back in though.

I don't know if it's the hype or just a popular mechanism with a geeky subject (sci-fi) or maybe the CCG-ish touch that makes it so highly ranked. I don't like games with so little to zero interaction (I didn't like it in Dominion but it's much worse in this aspect) also it has way too many special actions depicted on the cards so it takes too much effort to start to enjoy the game (strategic possibilities) at all. Nice cards, though, but I even have problems with the artwork: in San Juan you can clearly see who has which type of buildings and other cards - in RftG it's a lot harder.

RATING: 9
[2008.Mar.29] For gamers who enjoy Puerto Rico and San Juan, this card game is a must have. Based on the widely acclaimed Puerto Rico, Race for the Galaxy is its own game (albeit with quite a unique and colorful history) and is the smarter-and-sleeker card game that San Juan should have been (not to take anything away from San Juan, which is a good game itself). The similarity between it and its progenitor (Puerto Rico) should be quite obvious to almost everyone. Where this game takes a quantum leap forward is through the thorough usage of symbology on the cards. These symbols that appear on the cards--although daunting and seemingly incomprehensible at first--are an excellent summary of each card's ability, and is a breakthrough in design and presentation. It is very important to note that this game is best when played more than once. Familiarity with the different cards (and their abilities) is critically important for improved play. Give the game a try, but please play it more than once before rating it here on BGG--you'll be glad that you did. See you amongst the stars!

Although the game is obviously intended to be strongly thematic, I have a feeling that the theme is just pasted on, as if it were an abstract game. But despite that it's a good one. There's little interaction between players, it's more  of a multiplayer solitaire. In this particular case that doesn't bother me. But if you find interaction between players an essential game element, then this probably isn't a game for you.

This is a perfect storm for me: I learn abstractions like the icons easily, so I find the gameplay fluid and joyous. The core game mechanic is also about creating order out of chaos on a round-by-round but evolving axis, which is probably one of my favorite game activities--one that I am also pretty proficient at.

Luck can play a pretty strong role once all the expansions are merged in, which is a bit of a bummer.

Several games.  This was quite fun.  The operative word there: WAS.  Once my typical gaming crew had several dozen games under their belt(s), this game lost all appeal.

I did not like it much. First it's really confusing, there is a lot of components reusing and it's hard to catch the flow of the game. I don't like that you chose one role cards and that the other cards are just useless in your hands for the rest of the round. I don't like the fact that the only interaction with othr players is to try to guess which card they are going to play. Analysing your board is hard enough, analysing other people's board to expect that they intend to do is almost impossible since there is too much information to analyse and remember. In puerto rico, you an easily see what is going to happen by glancing at another player's board, here you can't because there is too much rules and abilities involved.

I would have prefered a game where all phase occur each turn and playing your role card only gives you the bonus. Being able to play more than 1 role card each turn but only recover 1 card randomly each turn could also be interesting. I would also loved more player interaction like attacking your opponent. Or if you play the same role card that somebody else, you need to bid another card (bottom right value) and the loser does not play this phase.

I find RftG very enjoyable and did not find figuring out the iconography difficult at all.  The first play or two might be a little slow figuring everything out, but it is fairly intuitive.  Of course, experienced players are at a huge advantage since they will know the card combinations that exist.  Much better than San Juan in every aspect!  I appreciate that each game is different - sometimes its a slower paced game more focused on developing engines to churn out victory points via production, other times it ends up being a straight up race to get 12 cards laid.  There are times where you will need 50+ points to win, and other times where even 20 points might win you the game!

NOTE:  I only give this a 10 with 2-3 players and preferably with the expansion.  I prefer not to play this game with 4 or 5 as it is harder to find the cards you desire when pursuing strategies.

Very good game.  I think I have a slight preference for it over San Juan just because of the added complexity, although that factor also obviously makes the learning curve for Race for the Galaxy a little  steeper.  I enjoy the simultaneous role selection and the fact that you can play whatever role you want on every turn.

Includes The Gathering Storm expansion.

RATING: 2
Did SAN JUAN need to be buried under the rubble of complexity and arcane iconography?  In brief, No.  Making the role selection a simultaneous action has the effect of introducing a dull guessing game, or maybe an un-interesting game of chicken.  In the end, yet another solo optimization race. This is worse than Princes of Florence for me.  Have played 4 player games where everyone stares at his own "tableau" and hand with maybe a few passing glances to the others' situations.

I do admit that adding the bonus tiles from Gathering Storm does improve the game, saving it from the 1 rating I'd considered.

RATING: 3
It is a game that seldom popular among wargamers too.  Colorful card art, thematic imagination about the sky, card multiplayer play...all add up to a success formula.  However, it doesn't work on me unfortunately.  The lack of a cooperative mode, neither nor competitive, renders this game colorless, instead of colorful.  No interactivity of any sort. The strategy seems to be for everyone going it alone, with what you have at hand and on the table. Or you just follow like hitchhiker in UNO.  Yes, the title is aptly named: it is a race.  The player who gets to the objective: either  deploying 20 cards onto the table or the victory points pool is all consumed.  Limited time and resources for you to do all sorts of things: explore, develop, produce or consume.  By the time you think you are just beginning to reap with your "perfect" plan, someone might have already won the game and ended it.  Oh, God, I should have discarded all those useless cards!  But how do you know?  It is that kind of uncertain chaos that ruin a player's experience in the end.  It is too random for my taste...like playing poker cards.  Where is my heart?  Or that King?  It might be fun for a family in an afternoon with a cup of tea.  To wargamers, definitely it is a hype and best to stay away.

RATING: 10
Rich management game with indirect but real interaction between players.  The following is partly based on what I heard my fellow players say, and on my own perception of the game.

* It takes one play of intense thinking to grasp the mechanics; you then feel like playing Race for the Galaxy again, after investing so much thoughts in the game.  You understand that you could have scored double the number of points you did.

You feel much more at ease during the second play, and you start to become immersed in the game mechanics.  You can really see how your cards can be combined and produce victory points.  In our game, the player who had played once had twice as many points as the two trailing players.

In later plays, you start paying attention to what the other players are doing, and try to profit from the actions they will probably choose, or use actions that do not benefit them.

* I like the fact that powers are expressed with symbols: even though they take one or two games to grasp, they allow you to quickly gauge the power of your cards.  Plus, the possible combinations between cards become graphically obvious.  I prefer this graphical system to the text found in San Juan.

* This game feels like San Juan to me, with an added tension coming from the simultaneous choice of role: you do not feel like your role was imposed on you (as can happen in San Juan), and you can concentrate on your plans.  Of course, the others are doing the same, and you can feel the "race" between players.

* After 150 games (with the 4 first expansions), the richness of the game still amazes me: I still regularly encounter new combos that were never used before. This includes Takeovers in 2-player games: they are very rarely used, but promise to be quite memorable when they do.

* I like how the complexity of the game can be tuned through adding more or fewer expansions. The feeling of deeply learning the smaller game is nice. The intricate variety of possibilities offered by the first arc expansions is incredibly rich.

There is no game in my collection that has received a more favorable turn around in my family than this game.  I first purchased this during an obsession with buying new games and I think I burnt out my wife.  She hated the game, the space theme, and iconography.  We tried San Juan, which she preferred.  I had Race up for trade/sale but luckily received no offers.  I was selected for the iOS beta and convinced my wife to give it another try.  The rest is history.  She finally "got it" and now it is one of her favorites and most played games in our collection.

This is one of the most confusing games to learn.

Each card give you a benefit.  If the cards had the benefit written out in text, I think the game would be much more fun to play.  Instead they have designed a huge set of graphics, all about 1 inch wide x 1/2 inch tall, trying to communicate what the benefit is.  This is extremely confusing.  We spend half our game trying to decipher the graphics often having to resort to the internet to get help. To me, this graphic representation of card benefits is a handicap to game play.

Also planets produce and consumer goods.  The way the game tracks these good is to take a face down card off the draw deck and place it on the planet.  It doesn't matter what the card does.  It is just a place holder for a good. Not only that but a color is associated with it.  This is also very confusing.  I would like it better if they just had some cards to represent the good or color cubes or something.  I think having actual cards for the goods on planets would eliminate a lot of confusion.

All that said, the game mechanics are fairly fun.  Once I figured out what most of the graphics meant, I starting thinking of stategies for future games.

I think it would be a good game but I have a lot of design issue with the cards.  I'd love to try to redesign them to be more intuitive.

RATING: 8.5
I love this game. I don't even care if the theme is "pasted-on" and there is no direct player interaction. It's a blindingly fast and involved economic engine builder with simultaneous action/phase selection (read: an element of opponent prediction) and randomisation that keeps it fresh but will rarely determine the winner. Too bad about the steep learning curve, but there was no way around it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Most of what you've heard about it is true. Yes, Race for the Galaxy is a good game. Yes, it feels like it lacks direct interaction. Yes, knowing the deck helps massively. Yes, the game is easy to play once you're into it but with rules hard to grok and a confusing icon system, the barrier to entry is very high. But if you like games and have the opportunity to be introduced to RftG by someone who knows it well, you should definitely give it a try (and then another try because you're first play might very well be horrible).

I'm sure that if I were willing to invest the 20-30 plays (possibly more?) required to learn this game, I would enjoy it, but I'm just not interested.

Full comment yet to come

EDIT: I've played this sucker till I had to buy Sleeves to protect my cards from wearing out. Forget about the interaction (the base game doesn't deal with that!) the gameplay is amazing, this is how a Eurogame must be designed! The amazing and infinite posibilities of interaction with the cards and the feeling of acomplishing something that works by itself (a self suficient resource loop) is always there, 'till the last card. I dunno how to explain it, but I love this game...

Played mostly with 3, better played with 3

My first plays of RftG left me wondering, concerned, and confused. The game was complex and damn near impossible to teach, but I kept coming back to it to learn more about it. Eventually it became my most played game of 2008, then my most played game ever!

I like it because:
-- Card games are fun especially when playing a clever card combo. 
-- The space theme is nice change from historical themes.
-- The icongraphy is some of the best I've ever seen.
-- It plays quickly thanks to simultaneous actions and consistent icons.

RATING: 10
Since we really liked [GAMEID=8217], [GAMEID=28143] seemed like it should have been a sure shot.  However, we held off on getting it for quite a while.  I was worried about the theme and the iconography not being appealing.  However, we finally got this in a trade and once we tried it out, we were hooked!  It's now one of our favorite games, and probably the second heaviest game that we have.

I shouldn't have worried.  This game was an amped up [GAMEID=8217]---it took the same basic gameplay, but added so much more.  It retained the feeling of building special cards, but in this case separated out Worlds and technology-oriented Developments.  However, added to these card combos were so many more paths to victory---you could go military, you could go exploring valuable worlds, you could set up a production/consumption engine.  All of this kept the game very fresh, although we're looking forward to trying the expansions.

The theme:  I was initially afraid that she wouldn't like the theme, although in retrospect I wouldn't have thought that Spanish colonialism would have been an attractive theme anyway.  She does put up with it, and she had a lot of fun with the art (especially cards like the Galactic Trendsetters or the Resort).  On the other hand, I really like the theme as I was a big fan of the Davin Brin Uplift novels.  Although abstracted, I do get the feeling of building a space empire.  I think that the more routes here compared to [GAMEID=8217] makes the game a little more real---e.g., there's a gameplay and thematic difference to military or production strategies.

The icons:  We had no problem with them.  By the second or third game, it wasn't even an issue anymore.  I was a little surprised by that, and thought that we would miss the text, but the icons producd a very clean result and lets you easily see what your opponent is building.

Interactivity:  Although it's been called multiplayer solitaire, we find the game has quite a bit of interactivity.  We're always looking at what each other is doing and we're constantly trying to guess and bluff what phase the other player will call that turn.  It's an additional layer of optimization that you have to do to play well.

Complexity:  I was worried about the complexity of the game, but it turned out to not be a problem.  She quickly grasped the rules and by the fourth or fifth game she was already scoring up to 54 points.  However, if we had not played [GAMEID=8217] before, it probably would have been [i]very[/i] difficult to pick up.  If you haven't played either, I would suggest picking [GAMEID=8217] up first.  On the other hand, the added complexity adds a lot to the game.  Having played [GAMEID=28143], I'm not sure if we'll ever go back...

So far, we've only played it with two, and mostly with the experienced two player rules.  It works very well.  This is another case where the two player game is different from the multiplayer game---you now call two phases each turn.  This gives you more control and ease in executing card combos, making the game more strategic.

One of those nigh-infinite-variations card games. Victory point collection based on both cards played in your tableau and actions taken during the game.

I like space themed games. RftG is fast and many strategies can be pursued. 

I think the players who have played often enough can tailor their play to what they see coming out from others. Not a problem but expansion may fix that.

The only "downside" is that there is no direct interaction with other players other than you perform what somewhat else chooses.

I've heard rumors that Tom is considering a more interactive game expansion subsequent to the long delayed 1st expansion.

Wow! A 9/10 - the first one since a looong time ago. At first I was very confused as to all the card interactions etc. but after having read several articles about different strategies on BGG and the first game everything became clear. Could this title be a little bit random but strategically more diversified Puerto Rico? I think so! I could even go so far as to claim that I could enjoy it MORE than Puerto Rico, which isn't my favorite title anyway, especially since the gameplay is much faster and less formulaic. =)

Race for the Galaxy may be as good as this type of game (something along the lines of "strategic resource management card game") can get. Certainly, it is good enough that many of its strengths and weaknesses point to qualities that may be inherent in the genre, and its strengths should only be rejected by designers that work in this category after careful consideration.

Aside from the card powers and a couple of minor points, the rules are actually quite clean and easy to grasp. Experience with Puerto Rico and San Juan are helpful, of course, but it shouldn't be too hard to figure out how to play the game from the rulebook.

Figuring out how to play the game [i]well[/i] is another story. RftG achieves an impressive array of strategic possibilities by taking a modular approach. A particular strategy is made up of one of the various card-generation modules that are available (say, an Alien Technology windfall world for trade, or one of the cards that gives its owner a card every time he produces a good of the specified type), plus 2-3 point generation modules (say, quick military settling plus New Galactic Order & Galactic Survey: SETI, or Galactic Trendsetters plus Galactic Renaissance) and voila, you have a strategy. Of course, some combinations have better synergy than others, so judgment and experience come into play here.

The problem is, with so many strategic "modules" in the deck, Lady Luck will walk up and bitch slap you sometimes. I'm not entirely sure how rare it is, even. You can start on a strategy in good faith, get smacked with an incompatible batch of cards from your first trade, switch plans, then get another batch of cards that fits your original, invalidated, plan again, or perhaps neither of your first two directions. While the first reverse is almost to be expected, the second, or even third, is not, necessarily, and a paucity of useful cards during the middlegame can be even worse. Adapting to this is impossible sometimes, at least at my level of skill. Fewer "modules" would ease this problem, but the price would be a cut in the delicious strategic diversity.

The range of strategies creates a steep, but interesting, learning curve for the game. A less palatable part of the learning curve for some, though, is the iconography of the cards. While I find the icons intuitive, and picked up on them quickly, my regular opponents are finding it a harder slog.

Worse, the size of the icons, mandated by Rio Grande to allow for larger art on the cards, compromises the game's usability. It is essentially impossible to read what a card can do from across the table, and there is simply no need for it. The icons could have been doubled in size, maybe more, and a change to a different, less cluttered and muddy, style of illustration would have made card identification a snap. They even fouled up the card name area, using an overly bold, overly compressed font, and setting it as dark grey on medium grey. You really have to strain to make out what an opponent can do. Boo, I say.

The dark side of the variety, and this is compounded by the poor usability decisions, is that RftG will bog down the analysis paralysis-prone pretty badly. Race wants to be a 20-30 minute game, packing a lot of punch in that timeframe. One or two slow players drag it out to 45-60 minutes, where it feels more "typical."

Oh, if you require the ability to reach out and directly affect an opponent's position, stay far far away. Personally, I'm down with indirect player interaction, but there is a large segment of the gaming community that howl at this type of game as though it kicked their puppy.

In spite of its problems, though, Race does have that certain "something" that keeps you wanting to come back for more. The variety of strategies keeps the game fresh, and you often feel there is something worth seeing just over the horizon, or a new insight to put into use. This is what gives it a similar feel to Magic:the Gathering, even without the cardboard crack business model. This quality makes it a textbook "9" on the BGG scale. I am (essentially) always interested in playing RftG, but, unlike a true 10, I can envision a situation where this may no longer be the case. We'll have to wait and see how I feel after I have explored most of its nooks and crannies.

UPDATE: Finally tried a couple of 2p games, which was interesting. The extra control makes having a solid strategy that much more important - you can't just ride the wave of chaos the other players produce, leeching as opportunities arise just won't work. Also, one of the "big three" - settle, develop and produce/consume - just won't come up much in any given game, which also makes it different in an interesting way.

I don't get a chance to play 2p games a lot, but RftG is definitely part of my 2p rotation now.

UPDATE: This game has single-handedly made 2p gaming my dominant mode nowadays. Trips to Tim Horton's for coffee and 2-5 (or even more once in a blue moon) games of RftG happens 2 or more times a week. I've played over 125 games at this point thanks to this factor. 10.

The iconography on this game makes it very difficult to teach to beginners, but if they get over that hump this is an extremely addicting quick game. While production seem overpowered without the expansion and getting good cards the first few rounds can seal a victory, the cards also means you have to adjust your strategy each game based on what you get. Yes this game is often multiplayer solitaire, but you also need to adopt your tactics based on what actions are available each round, allowing for at least a player vs. environment feel.

mixed feeling about the game...
it had a v. high rating on BGG but the complexity and confusing symbols made it untouched  for a year.
I finally had the time and courage to read the rules and played our first game...

It is a deep and involved card game, its root mechanism is in card management and building up combos.  I think there are lots of areas to be explored and it takes multiple play to fully understand it.  This game should be introduced to more "experienced" boardgames and is better if they have played games like puerto rico/San Juan.  I do think the setup is a bit troublesome as you  have to search for the 4 world cards in deck

Race for the Galaxy received a lot of comments and buzz prior to its release. There were the comparisons to San Juan and this intrigued me. I purchased it almost as soon as it was released and after struggling through the iconography, a magnificent game was discovered.

I have purchased the base game along with two expansions: A Gathering Storm and Rebel Versus Imperium.

2008-06: For this beginner... deducting points for the non-explained card symbols, especially on the initial 'beginner' hand cards. If the game reaches an excellent stride - maybe this problem will be overlooked. Deducting more for the twice-as-long rulebook (half in German, half in English). Looks potentially good, but too much to cut through for what it is at this point. I'd love to get to the point where the 'story' shines through. Not yet - stay tuned.

2011: Finally decided to crack the code on this game. It works well. Have been slowly picking up the expansions finally.

Ok this is a multi-player solitaire. So what? A LOT of Euro are solitaire fest. But RFTG is one of the best of its kind! 

Components: lots of card. Artwork is quite good. It's a bit expansive for the material you get but the gameplay   replay value makes for that.

Gameplay: everyone has talked about it. This is San Juan on steroid. But it is so much better: more cards, more variety in powers, more strategy, veryone can take the role they want, lots of different strategies.

Theme: I found the theme to be REALLY good. The different powers of the world VS the developement fits the theme very well. There some nice reference to David Brin Uplift Saga and some other Sci-fi literature (World producing spice anyone?).

What is most outstanding is that since it is a card game, replay value is really high. No 2 games feel the same and the setup cannot be too scripted (even if it can be influenced by starting world). The are really a lot of path to victory and for clever play. 

Update:
Since this game is a multi-player solitaire :), playing using the solitaire variant is still fun! It aso helps to get a feel of the game and of the different card combinations.

Update rating to a 10. This is a truly great game. I introduced 4 new people to it and they loved it. This is less complicated to explain/grok than I thought. As soon as player understand that at each phase they have to check each of their cards for specific effect related to that phase everything clicks in!

Update: best game of 2007 hands down. I cannot think of another game that can pack as much punch, thinking, fun and theme in such a short playing time. Once everyone knows how to play the strategy layer opens up to a totally different game.

A good game but don't really have a strong desire to play this. May revisit it some time in the future but right now it is just collecting dust.

2014 Update: Need to revisit this game with limited expansions.  I think the expansions really made the game a bit too out of control for me.  Would like to just play the base game or maybe one expansion without the invasions.

This one is an improvement over San Juan. It's San Juan and SO much more. I've even heard they have expansions in the works, and it will only serve to make a great game even better.

It has no real player interaction, but then again most of the experience of this game is simply to do it better than anyone else.

I would categorize this game as a "Euro" card game.  This card game has a bunch of strategy and it is different each time you play.  I would like to see a tournament of this game some time in the future as it would be really interesting to see the diversification in strategies that each person would use.

One problem that I have noticed with this game is it is very hit or miss.  Originally I enjoyed playing it, now I seem to avoid it at all costs.  I will play it if there is really nothing else to play.

Update: This game you have to play 20-30 times before you get it. That is quite an investment to make for any game.

Comparisons to San Juan aside, Race for the Galaxy provides an interesting take to the card game.  It's systems are far more complicated than expected (though not negatively so), and represent far more of what might be expected from a board-board game instead of the card-board game that it is.  The player interaction makes this something a bit more difficult than just optimizing and flying through card draws.

RATING: 9
A fun game, with a lot of interesting card combos and the like. It feels like your fate is largely in the draw of the right cards, but there is certainly skill involved as well - I'm just not sure what degree of skill vs. luck there is.

This game is highly addictive, once you get past the rough first couple of games (where you are learning the iconography and how the game plays) - still a lot of fun after many plays (probably getting close to triple digits, and the games been out less than 6 months as I write this).

Played one game. Or I should say I watched a group of people play. Next play I might have an idea of what to do. Lost, does not begin to describe how I played this game. Played again - Stillllllllll don't know what I'm doing in this game. My I Q is too low to play this game. Played for a third time. This game is like a pair of underwear that's a size too small. It does not feel good to me. Played two more times and I now have an idea what to do. This game has gone from a rating of 3 to 7. I just keep plugging away at this game.I will get it all someday. After Plugging away, I now really like this game. I have the expansions.

RATING: 8
Wonderful engine-building game, but a pain to teach. It's easier than it looks, but it is so hard to get new players over that hump. It is also difficult to be good at it right away, which can turn players off. (Roll for the Galaxy has more appealing components, and I found it to be the more worthwhile purchase over time.)

At it's best it is really fast, has a lot of interesting decisions, and a *ton* of variety. Your tableau is different every game, and it is soooo satisfying when you start to get good turns because you correctly guessed what the other players were going to choose, and you start to understand what to pick. Then the game really starts to sing and become a "race".

In terms of atmosphere, it is a dream come true if you like Master of Orion, or space empire building games. Your civilization kind of becomes a little story, and the art is fantastic.

RftG is one of those games that can not be fully appreciated without some knowledge of the cards and how they interact.  Lots of "aha" moments as you consider a card and it's potential synergy with others becomes apparent.  I love that in a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is a medium euro that has a bit of a learning curve but plays very quickly with mostly simultaneous card play. Expansions make it very deep with multiple paths to victory.  

Heck, sometimes you just want some brain burn without all the fuss of intricate setup or waiting on other players. With Race, you get in, you get your brain burn on, and you get out.

I initially liked the game, rating it an 8.  I just raised it to a 9.  It has taken a few plays to get into it, after just floundering about until it ended before, now there is a definite drive to develop and more of an understanding of how the tempo of the game works.  It is much more than San Juan in space, a deeper and more satisfying game, with more options, more decisions and, it has to be said, a much more interesting thematic backdrop.  It is my hot game of the moment (which just shows how behind the times of BGG I am...). Update: with the full game (all expansions) and with the number of plays so far, my interest in the game has not dropped so it joins my list of 10s.

RATING: 9
This is one of the best games I've ever played. The game mechanic is balanced and well thought out. The game play really makes you feel like you are in a race and never have enough time to do everything you want to do. Although some might see this as a negative, but I think this is the core of game. Every decision you make is crucial for each round.

A simultaneous/secret action selection tableau/engine-building game.  Outstanding design; fascinating artwork.  There is some "luck" involved in quickly obtaining the best combination of 6-cost developments and synergistic cards, but there is much to be said for making the most out of a weird hand.  Along with Tichu, one of my hands-down most-played games.  TTFN

The learning curve is for real, but once you grasp it, it's easy to appreciate how elegantly the pieces fit together.  It's funny, I don't think that the theme and the mechanics are particularly well-integrated, but the game benefits immeasurably from the theme, the quality of the artwork, etc.  It is a bit of a challenge to assemble a thematic narrative out of a game of it, which I feel like should bug me more than it does.  Mostly, I just admire its flexibility and scale, which hits a Dominion-like sweet spot for me.

5/8/15: Haven't played it much.  I want to play it more, but the symbology is too much for wife.  Score: 7
6/1/15: Tried it again after having it sit on the shelf for years.  Once we got past the symbology learning curve, it started to make sense for both of us.  Very similar to San Juan, but with a wider variety of possible strategies.  Quick play time is nice, too.  It may even play quicker than San Juan...  Really liking this game now! Score: 9
6/18/15: My wife and I have been playing this quite a bit and really liking it.  I think we have really discovered the interaction side of it now.  In our most recent game, she started out early with Consume/Produce.  So I played a few production worlds, hoping to piggy back off of her Produce.  But she noticed and stopped selecting Produce!  Eventually, I was forced to play Produce myself.  Score: 10

Changed score from 8 to a perfect 10. I still rate this a 5 in game weight. The game does have an intense learning curve, but I'm astounded by the replay value considering the limited amount of cards.

Very little setup, quick gameplay, wonderful artwork and theme and really deep mechanics and variety make this game just a complete joy each and every time it's played.

Simply the best (non-collectable) 'card game' I have ever played, period.  It has a bit of a learning curve, but once you have a grip on the basics, the games are quick and smooth.  It's like a multi-player version of solitaire, but with enough variety and replayability that it never gets old.  I'll play RftG anytime.  I've also made a 're-themed' Doctor Who version to capture my kids' interest and get them hooked...

Tableau building card game set in space.  It includes a role selection mechanic that allows other players to take the same action.  You can get more cards, build developments, settle planets, produce goods, set goods for victory points, or trade goods for more cards.  Cards are used as currency as well as can be played.  The symbols on the card make this game difficult to learn.  But if you learn the symbols the game plays very fast.  

An excellent game once you come up on the learning curve.

this game is so good that after playing it , if i want to play terraforming mars i always think that terraforming going to take looooonnnng,,,instead we should play race for the galaxy...(i always play terraforming with 2 player)

because of similarity in the feeling of playing them ,,, but then again they are different game and have different mechanism .

i like playing race for galaxy  but my wife dont enjoy playing it because of all the cards and different strategy to win (in my mind these are pros (^__^) )

so my rating for this game is : 8.5
my wife rating : 6.9
average : 7.7

Wow, this game hit the spot from the start.  Sure, it's lacking in direct confrontation (something I enjoy in a game), but it's not missed.  The graphic design (heavy dependence on cryptic icons) and theme prevent easy play with non-gamers, but otherwise a great design.  I prefer Glory to Rome if time is available.  The expansions are not a must, but do add interesting combinations and additional goals.  They add some interaction, too, but I'm not sure it's worth it.

This is a pretty good game.  I found this game after Google searching "if you like 7 wonders then you will like . . ."  The game has simultaneous play similar to 7 Wonders which is great and makes for fast play.  The major limitations of this game are that you can only play with 4 players and the biggest of all, that there is virtually no player interaction.  There is virtually nothing you can do to impede or interact with the other players in the base game.

Another role-selection game. I enjoy Race for the fact that it only uses cards. I think this was the first "card only" game that I actually took a liking to. I usually prefer a board with pieces that move around (even if its finicky). And most times I'm disappointed with cards. But the way Race uses cards as EVERYTHING you do in the game, is genius. You use them as your hand, to build up your tableau, to pay the cost for your cards, as resources for your plants. Its something I had never experienced until this game.

The biggest (and most obvious) downside are the symbols for the game. It is hard to teach new players this game since its like learning a new language.

I prefer San Juan a bit more compared to its more confusing cousin Race of the Galaxy. The theme is carried well but sometimes it's tough to get yourself started especially if your homeworld and your starting hand doesn't jive very well together. So many symbols to keep track of! Some of the symbols are so similar to each other that you are left wondering and searching the symbol charts. This of course would become less of a hassle after more plays and could grow on you.

Excellent engine-building game with diverse paths to victory.  Highly replayable.  Iconic system is easy to comprehend after a game or two.  Major downside from my perspective is the speed with which the game ends, and thus the lack of opportunity for significant engine progression.  Also suffers from solitaire-style play, which expansions have apparently addressed.

It's essentially multiplayer solitaire. I can see the appeal in the game.  There are a lot of choices and routes to victory in the game.  The learning curve for this game stems from its insane abundance of iconography on the cards.  Once you play through a few rounds it kinda starts to click but will take time for new players.  Not a bad game.  Let's see how it holds up after a few more plays.

This is a fun, tableau building game ala San Juan, but with more depth and more fun.  This is primarily due to the fact that you have more options you can build to make production a viable strategy.

There are many very cool options to put together some sort of "machine" in your strategy, and both building and/or collecting VP chips are equally good paths for getting points.

With a great variety of cards and fairly quick play time, I think this will get alot of plays.

Straightforward "buy cards and get victory points" game. In principle not difficult to explain or play, but there's a fairly steep learning curve for new players due to a complex system of symbols to indicate what a card can do, and how and when it does it. There's some kind of logic to the design of the symbols, but the symbols don't quite contain enough information to be easily decipherable for new players, so any game with a new player will tend to get bogged down in "wait while I'm checking the rules to figure out what the cards in my hand does".

RATING: 8
7/2008 It certainly has some similarities with San Juan but has a lot more variety.  There's many strategy possibilites and some planning is possible despite being a card drawing game.  Card knowledge is vital if you wish to win.  This game might even be a 9'er if it stays clear of becoming a CCG.

5/2010 With the added expansions the game realy comes together.  There's time pressure, difficult decisions and lots of subtle interaction; almost making this a brain burner.  The (complete) game (with all expansions) is a 9er.  (Tom, it feels rude to initially have released an "incomplete" game just to get the extra cash through expansions.)

1/2011 It's tooooo much.  With only occational play as times goes by the game is just too complex with all expansions.  Actually, prestiege and take-overs could have been left out.  Rating back to 8.

Recommended for those who love Power Grid, it's an economic expansion game set in space with interesting simultaneous action mechanics. Some similaries to San Juan but deeper. After trying, it's *much* closer to San Juan, though more interesting and strategic. Learning curve is steep but short due to heavy use of symbols on cards, but they help a lot once you get used to them.

Compared with modern deck builders, this game simply has too much luck in the card draw, which is partly compensated by the short playtime. The many expansions, while giving extra replayability, also adds ways too much complexity to a single 'short' game. My gamegroup usually plays with only the objective tiles in addition to the base game.

OK, so if you don't like trying to decipher stuff, stay far away.  There are a couple of people in our group who kind of get it and there's another guy who has played it four times and still has no idea what to do.  I like it and I think it is a fun game, but you do need to invest in it a bit.

Massively replayable, fast and fun once you have grasped the rules, though arduous to explain to new players and the symbols on the cards can be difficult to interpret for newcomers.

Everyone should download Keldon's AI and play this 100 times.  If you still don't like it, there's something wrong with you.

I've had the most fun ever just learning the ways of this game, and I've a lot more to learn yet.

The huge variety the many different cards bring to a highly strategic game is just amazing.  Every so often I still have moments where I find a great use for a previously unloved card, or find a new twist on a previous strategy. 

The balance of strategy with flexibility, variety with consistency and randomness with control have not been better achieved in any other game.

It took a few plays to learn some strategies for San Juan, so I don't expect this to be any different. The icons aren't all that difficult, but they do take some extra thinking time, where words might have been quicker. We need to give this another go - it didn't give us the same buzz that San Juan does the first time we played, but I don't think that was a reasonable expectation. I've a strong hunch this is a great game, and sooner or later I'll give it the table time it deserves.

Fun game, I would love to buy it if only I hadn't learned about Eminent Domain. Race has nice art, is cheap, and entertaining. The usage of cards as to take actions compensates for the luck of drawing cards, but this entire mechanic is bypassed in Eminent Domain which is quite simply a better game.

The similarities to San Juan are pretty obvious. I haven't played enough to say whether it works as well, but I find the SF theme appealing. However I didn't feel much (any?) interaction in the two games I played :-(

Update after several games: Nope not much interaction here.
Plus a bad draw can srew you up beyond repair. Downgraded to a 5

Love it to bits. I have only played it against the computer though. Way too complex for me to try and explain to a family group that has difficulty understanding Puerto Rico.

Update : Played it plenty of times now with a group of gamers. Really fun. 9 rating still stands. Not a 10 because your strategy is partially dictated by the cards you draw (although there are a lot of ways to mitigate the pure luck).

Nice game, but it has no place for me. If I want a game full of different cards with endless interactions, I've Magic. If I want a similar idea, but with simpler execution (thus more accessible to newbies), I've San Juan. "Race for the Galaxy" is a sort of middle ground I simply do not need.

Extremely light interaction and quite long learning curve due to the many cards and the abstruse myriads of symbols (that also failed to make it language independent, since there's text here and there too!).

The sci-fi theme and the bland artwork do nothing for me as well.
Pricey.

UPDATE: tried again (two year later) and it felt a needlessly overcomplicated San Juan.

Waaaaayyyy to much going on here.  Sure, the more you play it the more you can keep all the ridiculous modifiers and relations between the different types of cards in your head, which would make the game more enjoyable, but why bother?  

And what is the payoff for playing this game numerous times just to understand what is going on?  Not much for my money, although some people get a kick out of these hand building kinds of games.

Game for gamers. Better than [b]San Juan[/b]. There are many similarities for sure, but everything that is different, is better (even the theme ;)). First few games were a bit long and confusing and all I could do was stare at my own cards (and choose my actions only thinking of myself). Learning curve is much steeper than in [b]San Juan[/b]. The cards have symbols indicating their function instead of text. It takes time to learn the symbols, but the player aids are excellent. The player interactions come into play after few games (of course it exists in the first games, but players may not be aware of it). Can be played in less than 30 minutes.

I'm starting to appreciate how you starting draw determines most of what you will do for the game, and how that can be a bummer. I've dropped the rating down from "favorite" status because of that, and because it also seems that the "race" aspect means planning is the wrong way to play, and for some reason I'm biased towards planning games even though I don't do any planning when I play them.

My favourite game by far. To me the icons are fairly easy to understand after a two or three plays, and the variety of different strategies and options makes for a different game each time, so it doesn't get old. I enjoy the subtle interaction of "leeching" off other's choices, and trying to guess what action they'll take. The relatively short playtime means you can quite happily play 3 or more games in a row, and allows you to test new strategies without feeling you'll waste 2 hours if it goes horribly wrong at the start. An excellent game, can't wait for the expansions.

Played this so many times my deck has started to fade - If id known how much i was going to like this id have sleeved the cards. card game where you build a tableau of planets / developments which will aid you during the game and score points for you at the end. pay for these cards by discarding other cards in your hand. synergy and variety make this a great card game and easy to learn. Only negative i have is that there are a few far too powerful cards (improved logistics)and the player with the most 6 point development cards usually always wins

One of the best card games, ever.  Basically a space/scifi card game version of a worker placement game like Puerto Rico. Not sure that comparison is fair, but to me it's similar (actually a better comparison is San Juan, which is the card game variant to PR) since it's a similar game mechanic of pick a role (which everyone uses, but you picking it gives you a benefit), then you do things early game to gain more cards with an end game goal of getting the most Victory Points.  Again, similar to San Juan but RftG is more complex with more strategy, which to me means it's better!
Only slight flaw of this game is it's been criticized for being a multiplayer solo game; meaning you win based on your own game and the interaction with your opponents doesn't really matter. It's a good/fair criticism; if the game could find a way to force players to interact and create some kind of offensive/defensive element it would be even better.

Simply can never get enough of this game. It's extremely compact for all it's variability, surprisingly thematic for a card game, low on amount of decisions but the impact and improtance of those decisions are extreme. Despite that folks believe there is little player interaction, I disagree. The choice of your roles is huge and you can perform plenty of defensive maneuvers to limit VP acquisitions. This game never gets boring and plays quickly enough.

The unfortunate part is that non-gamers that I've played with don't tend to "get it" even though it's an almost entirely card-based game.  Due to the large number of cards to learn, the learning curve is several games, which is also unexpected for most people.

Played twice and still can't quite grasp a good strategy to take.  I think it will be fun if I could commit myself to learning some of the cards.  Yes, this game is like San Juan - but multiplied exponentially in complexity.  It's not just a "little" deeper.  There are MANY more cards and MANY more benefits and actions that they allow.

Certainly willing to play it again.  If I can't fee really comfortable with it after 1 or 2 more plays though, I'm not sure if I'll be very desirous to return.

Once you grow a pair, you'll realize that there is so much to this game.  Even after repeated plays, there is so much strategy to work out here and explore.

It's a race and a death-match all at once.  Crush your opponent under the weight of your engine, or flash to the finish lithely before they get a chance to get going?

Or do you just shoot for the stars?

RATING: 7
Great game! It is very fast to play, with quite a lot of indirect interaction after acquiring enough skill. No direct "take that" mechanics may be a plus for some players.

It has quite a learning curve. The first hurdle is at the very beginning - learning the symbol system. Once you get that, you can play, but you will get beaten by more experienced players.

The second hurdle is learning the basics of strategy. You have to get the idea of the four possible routes to getting VPs (getting lots of expensive developments, military conquest of high-scoring worlds, producing and consuming goods for VPs and trading, that is selling valueable goods to get lots of cards to buy anything needed).

The third hurdle is starting to observe the other players and trying to figure out what action will they take. In the meantime you'll get to know the cards available and plan accordingly.

When you get over the third hurdle, the game suddenly becomes highly interactive (even tho you dont speak with other players). Before that, it may seem like a multiplayer solitaire.

A San Juan -variant. The symbols aren't too well desinge, so they're hard to grasp at first. After couple of tries it evolves into space of many possibilities and strategies wider than in the original. The biggest problem is that there's not much interaction between players. It's like multiple solitaire.

RATING: 9
This game implements an incredibly slick and elegant card system....once you get it. However trying to play the game straight out of the box following the rule book is very difficult. You really need to watch it played on youtube to get it then its relatively straight forward.

The game plays in 5 phases I) Explore pick up new cards ii) Develop-play advantageous cards which aid later phases iii) Settle-play planets which generally produce or consume goods iv) Produce-Produce goods  v) Consume goods for points or extra cards 

The currency is simply number of cards which are played to develop or settle various cards. The sacrifice of various cards is where some skill comes into it and can be very rewarding or upsetting depending on how things play out.

In a turn round each player (2-4 in base game) chooses  a phase to play and all the chosen phases are played by all players. If you pick the phase you have advantages e.g. pick up more cards, use less cards etc. This though is the only real player interaction. This adds to the game as you can predict the actions of your opponents to aid your game. 

The race element of the game also mean you have to track what your opponent/s is doing as an end game is generated when players reach a certain number of settlemnets/developments played or uses all assigned victory points for the game.


Winning is simply the player with the most net point value of cards and victory points earned throughout the game as well as any development bonuses

There are many strategies to win making it very replayable i.e. miliatary occupation, producing or playing key devlopment cards. 

Only slight downside is the rules provided but once you get it the reference cards are very useful and it makes sense.

Thoroughly recommend for 2 or more players

10.0 - Jan 2015 - 10 plays:  My first 10.  I absolutely love playing this game, and would do so at any opportunity.  I got The Gathering Storm for Christmas, but I haven't played it yet.  Unfortunately for me, this game is not as highly loved by my wife, so I don't get to play it too often.

10.0 - Oct 2015 - 27 Plays:  This is still going strong as my favorite game.

Good game.After close to ten plays I am finally starting to understand the ins and outs of this game. The iconography is very confusing. Be sure to play with someone who has played before. Do not give up on this game, be sure to play quite a few times before determining whether you like this game or not. It really requires a lot of study, but it is a VERY fun and interesting game. It has lots to offer, and if you can read the faces of your opponents than you can determine what action to play and take advantage of your opponents action as well. 
I will count plays with expansions here.

Great game.  The iconography is fantastic--I think the game would be fiddly to the point of unworkable without it.

This is the game San Juan wishes it could be (although, SJ with the expansion is pretty decent).

[i]*Own all 3 expansions from the first arc.  I will say that having all the expansions mixed in does change the game a good deal, and slow it down some. Not a fan of that aspect, but I like almost all the expansion cards, so I don't want to take them out.

*Now own the first expansion of the new arc, Alien Artifacts (and a second set of the base game).  It seems pretty great so far, and I haven't even tried out the orb![/i]

Excellent Game. I agree that this is the game the San Juan failed to be!

I have changed my opinion: Race for the Galaxy is for Hardcore gamers, while San Juan is more suited for casual players.

Race for the Galaxy has
+ Complexity
- Space theme
- Nice, but unsupportive art
+ A lot of diversity, giving a huge replay value

San Juan has:
+ Simplicity and elegance
+ Puerto Rico Theme
+ Clear supportive art
- less replay value

This is a fantastic card game which I envision getting a ton of play out of.

Takes a couple of games to get the hang of mechanics (can be quite intimidating with all the symbols but they are all very clear when you are familiar and complex rules are explained on the cards) and then 5-10 more for some basic different strategies to make you competitive.

Works best as a 2 player game in my opinion but also works well with 4 players.

RATING: 7
I've played this a few times against actual players and about 6 or 7 times against the Keldon AI.

To put it briefly: This is one of the more interesting and deep engine builders I have ever played.  You are given a slew of interesting and choices to make from start to finish.

That's also the reason why I prefer Roll for the Galaxy over Race.

Understanding and able to play at a competent level requires players to drown themselves into a sea of strange iconography and insanity.  It demands a new player's patience and several hours to finally "grasp" the game.  The AP potential is huge considering that you need to spend cards in your hand to build your tableau, which is another level of thinking for the players to ponder.  Great idea in terms of depth, but with certain players it could be the killing blow due to a player or two spending the table's time over a simple decision.

As someone who has been into tabletop games for a good portion of my life living on this planet, I can handle that.  I'm not the norm though and the vast majority of players would probably give up after their first game due to the complexity and not having the faintest idea on what is considered a "good play"

Hence I will always be up for a game of Race for the Galaxy, even though I will likely lose badly in it, but I will never own it when Roll for the Galaxy is available.  Roll might be a more "casual" trimmed down experience, but it can be understood and enjoyed after the first few rounds, not half a dozen games.

Hybrid between Puerto Rico and 7 Wonders. An ugly game with great mechanics. I hesitated for 2 years to try it because the design is, to put it mildly, damn ugly. In the end, the sheer number of convinced people that had similar tastes to mine made me pick it up. After three 2-player games, we really enjoy it and I am happy I finally bought that game.

If there is a version with sexier graphics in the future, I would happily buy it.

I came into my first game of Race not expecting to like it. Low player interaction isn't a dealbreaker for me, but it's a red flag. And that first game was rough; I don't think it was taught to me the way my brain would have preferred. My second was much smoother, and by the third I could see how much was on offer.

I love the role selection, the guessing game (also fun in Puerto Rico and San Juan), and needing to have a strategy and adapt your tactics to the cards you draw and the pace the table sets. There's a lot here, especially for a game that can take less than 30 minutes.

The card art rocks, and the theme is expressed well through it and through the little "snapshot" of your empire you get as the game progresses.

Early 08First two games learning with 2-players total.  Seems like it will be very addictive (like San Juan).Next few games only reinforced our initial views.  Still hard to peg a rating for it.Update - April 08 - about 25 games now.  This is so very addictive.  We are thoroughly enjoying it.  The aspect of 'discovery' of what works and altering strategies on the fly keep this fresh.  Rating 9 - this may move up to a 10, I cannot get enough or too much of this game.

Update June 2008 - move rating to a 10 - after 50 or so plays.  This game is replayable like Magic, but fast, reasonably priced and works great with 2, 3, or 4 with no changes.  My current favorite card game.

Into July... taught my wife in the midst of her cancer treatment how to play.  She seemed to like it.  Daughter and I played 13 times today (some including mom).  This game is so very addictive.

More expansions haven't added many more plays.  The game is on hiatus for us.

RATING: 9
Ready your exploring boots and pull out that space suit. Fire up the terraforming robots and get ready to race the stars! You are explorers and opportunists taking advantage of the vastness of space and the secrets it holds to succeed. Here the fate of the galaxy is truly "in your hands". With a handful of cards and a deck to explore in, players work with what they have in order to pursue the best strategy in order to explore, colonize, develop, produce and trade their way to winning.

Resourcefulness, cunning and a bit of luck play centrally in Race for the Galaxy. Like in many card-driven games, players try to maximize a limited amount of resources and actions in a turn to put together a viable enough way to win. Victory points are awarded with every successful development, settlement and trade done. And once enough of the galaxy has been developed and colonized, the game ends and the one who has affected it the most, whether by peaceful diplomacy, by military conquest or by profitable trade, wins.

The mechanism for limited actions taken in a round requires players to maximize what they do in a turn. So what does a good opportunist do? He not only takes advantage of what lays before him, but also of those going after what he wants. Though this is a competitive race with only one winner, it is important for you to realize that relying on your competitors can actually be the best strategy. Race for the Galaxy brings out this sneaky paradigm pretty well.

Light, fast and simple. There is no direct confrontation here, RftG is a flat out race to the finish line. But if you focus to much on your lead, you can easily forget how your opponents are gaining from every action you take and netting them more benefits than you.

Update: What the hell was I talking about below? This is a veritable modern classic, as accomplished as they come. One of my favorite games, and I suck at it.

(2007) Very decent game; complex, fast moving, low fuss. Contrary to the general sentiment, playing this has raised my appreciation level for San Juan considerably, which tries to do much less in a more pronounced way than RftG, putting you in a very tight straitjacket from the get-go.

The flexibility that you perceive in RftG might be a bit deceiving, though. When you start playing better opponents, perfect execution of the one chosen path could be equally important, which seems to hurt the game a bit.

Broadly speaking, this is the kind of game where you build up a resource engine, then switch to earning victory points and hope the game doesn't end before you want it to. There is a decent (but not astronomical) number of scoring paths to follow, but during a game only a few of them seem worth considering. The scoring often seems slightly crude, since most of the special powers boil down to a number and only a few effects change the mechanics in other ways.

The game works best, in my opinion, with two players, two actions per player and turn, larger starting hands and no homeworlds.

Simple game play, yet interesting strategies. Similar to MTG in terms of trying to figure out synergies between your cards, but I think that's about as far as that goes. Really forces you to adapt to your draw evolve what direction you are going.

I certainly enjoy it as it has a good deepness to the strategy but is playable quickly and easily. Really well designed and it's clear that it has been throughly playtested. But it also doesn't blow my mind and I think there are other games out there that scratch a similar itch that I generally prefer. I'll still happily play this regularly, but I'm not in agreement with the zealous love that some seem to have for it.

Race for the Galaxy is unique in that it is a game you can clearly get better at playing over time.  There are many different strategies to choose from, which helps with the replay factor too.

As I've played, I've grown more excited for each time this hits the table, rather than slowly eroding my desire to play.  If you're looking to learn a game to play with a specific group as a reoccurring event, then this is a game you should seriously consider.

Let me contrast this to Seven Wonders.  RftG plays faster, with more variation between games, and you actually control your own destiny.  When I lose in RftG I usually know what I did wrong, and when I win I know exactly what I did right.

RATING: 6
3 / 5 - Good.

After one play, I can see that this is a game which would require multiple plays to properly evaluate. To my surprise, I actually found the game quite thematically compelling: the effects on the cards all seem to make sense (space marines give you a military bonus etc) and I did get the sense of building up a little space empire. But the game itself seemed absurdly confusing, not just in terms of rules and icons, both of which were amazingly obtuse, but in terms of options. There's so many different effects and ways to get things done that I find it hard to fathom how anyone could form a coherent strategy, especially with the luck-of-draw. And yes, it's very low interaction.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Fun game, don't let the discussions about the rules and icons scare you off. The rules aren't as complex as they seem at first but the paths to victory are numerous and not obvious. 

Race has been described by others as having a sharp learning spike. Keldon AI is an effective but an emotionless and unforgiving trainer. Good way to reinforce the rules if you don't have someone to teach you instead.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Pros:
+ Multiple legitimate paths to victory
+ Deep Gameplay - constantly discovering new card interactions
+ Quick play
+ Outside of the luck of card draw, no kingmaking or aiming effects, so the game is less frustrating than it could have been
+ The simultaneous phase selection mechanic is one of the best and most interesting mechanic in any game I've ever played

Cons:
- That "multiple paths to victory" does not correlate to you getting to make a lot of decisions - way too often the game more or less plays itself with one obviously correct decision each turn
- Way too often one player will get a series of good draws early and will totally steamroll everyone else
- Overwhelming and frustrating for casual or new players
- The artwork is beautiful (and this is a minority opinion) but I find the color palette of the game drab

2-6 players (with the expansions)
hand management
simultaneous action selection
variable phase order

This was one of two games mocked up to be the card game version of Puerto Rico. One game became San Juan, the other became this. You can feel the similarities. Very light on player interaction, but you will spend more time thinking about what other players are doing than in Dominion.

Rules are printed on cards in a symbolic language described on a variety of cheat sheets. Most people know the game after a single play through, and it plays quickly.

One of my favorites. I realize now that I don't understand as much about the strategy as I'd like to, but that doesn't detract from the glorious game design.

2/15/13: I get a lot more of the game now. Also, I don't imagine I'll play this without Brink of War unless I'm teaching newbies. This game is a really solid 9/10.

I HATE the icons for this game.  Absolutely hate em.  I know they were supposed to be helpful and make more room for the artwork, but I'd rather have everything written out on all of the cards, like it is in San Juan.  The icons are why I gave this a medium game weight, b/c I just don't think they're intuitive.  I'm sure I'll love this game once I get the hang of it, but learning it is going to take awhile.  Especially since my gaming group finds it just as intricate as I do (although whether that's due to the game itself or my explaining abilities is unknown at present).  I can't imagine trying to learn it if one hasn't played San Juan before.

RATING: 8
The second euro game I bought.  I've played this one primarily 2-4 players, with my favorite being the 2-player advanced version.  I use the cards from The Gathering Storm, but not the goals.

What I like:
- It's fast. Most games take 20-40 minutes.
- You can specialize in different areas to get VP.
- Simultaneous role selection reduces downtime.
- 2-player advanced lets you plan your strategy a little better, and makes the game go faster.
- No direct conflict, but you need to watch your opponents to be efficient, and perhaps deny them high scoring cards.
- Sometimes you have to make hard decisions to keep or discard cards.

What I don't like:
- Some strategies, like going the production/consumption route, will make your action selection pretty repetitive once you've built your engine.
- Occasionally you can get behind due to a series of bad card draws.

Bought at Kingslayer Comics 5/5/16.

Easily portable, with quick but deep gameplay.  The different paths to victory (military, trade, produce/consume, developments) are all viable.  Each game also plays fairly differently, as the start world and cards you draw have big impacts.

Played the first "learner's" game, and this is a lot like San Juan. There seems to be a lot more going on in RftG, perhaps because we've played SJ into the ground.

Still not sure about this game. Played it twice, and it seemed that there was a lot of unknowns and room for changing rules up.

2-4 in the base game, but with a 5-6 expansion. I owned the first two expansions, but traded down to just the first to allow for solo and 5 player. Frankly, it takes so damn long to play with 5 that I may unload that expansion too (though having the extra cards might make it worthwhile keeping)

Like San Juan on steroids.  Sorta.

It's possible to play with people who've played this *a lot*. When that happens, it isn't as much fun unless everyone at the table also knows all the cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
3 4-player games, 1 3-player game. A more advanced version of San Juan, there is a lot more options going on and it can be a steep learning curve getting to grips with all the icons and the actions. However, once you get past that it's a quick playing game with lots of different directions you can go for victory. Expansions planned, and many of the cards have text/events/stuff that doesn't get used in the basic game. [Update] Received as a Chrissy prezzy from my wonderful wife [02/13/2008] After several games you don't really play this game, it plays you. Either you get draws that fit with your previous cards, or they don't. Not much you can do about it. [01/04/2009] Every time I play this game it goes down in my estimation. The winner gets the draws that fit into what they built, the others don't.

I've played 50+ games with the full range of players, and this is a keeper.  My only complaint is the lack of strategy  surrounding the various 6"?" buildings.  You are either going to get the necessary linked cards to boost your VP's or you're not.

RATING: 9
An exceptional game, finely balanced.  Involving playing a combination of cards representing one's space empire, collecting more cards and scoring points for having the most impressive civilization.

 Great art, and games play quickly.  The title really matches the game play - often the race is down to the last few cards to decide who wins.

However, if you are looking for a game to introduce to new gamers, then this is not the game you are looking for.  There is some initial rule complexity to explain, and some iconography which takes a little while to get used to.  The first game is necessary just to get over the initial complexity (and is unlikely to be enjoyable).  But once everything 'clicks' then this game is absolutely marvellous.  Best to let an experienced player teach this game and play open handed to talk the new players through the different strategies.

Have only recorded a few plays in person, but have over 40 via the Keldon.net app.

This was the first game that really blew my mind. Still one of my favorites. The iconography is annoying, but intuitive after thoroughly learned. Setup and tear down are lightning fast. There is hand and tableau management, simultaneous action selection and engine building in the game. The mechanisms are very elegant. My biggest issue with it is teaching the iconography. The player aid is almost as big as the box, for crying out loud! But nonetheless, for me, it's all worth it. Really amazing game.

This is a great, medium-light game.  There is a lot of information on the cards, but once you understand them (see the well organized reference cards that come with the game) the game flows very quickly.  Simultaneous playing makes the games very quick but satisfying. Wonderful art work, good replayability, room for expansions and low price tag make this an obvious purchase.  Was a 9, after a bunch more plays this is now a 10.

An interesting, and fun, game. Love the variety of cards, actions, strategies. Hate the variety of cards, actions, strategies! It’s too much really because no 2 games are the same and you have to be an expert in every aspect to have a chance at winning. You need to play a few times just to get the hang of it, and then another few times to try and memorize all the cards. 

But once you do this, it’s a fun game. There’s no bash the leader and you can tell where you stand at all times. The rulebook is good and the card art is fine. It plays quickly as everyone plays same time and that’s wonderful. 

The expansions add some fun (and yet more variety of cards, actions, strategies) as well. 

I’d rate it higher, but the wide expertise you need to have to have a chance (and there is some randomness/luck that can sometimes overwhelm or benefit you) really detracts.

RATING: 8
I think this game is overrated, but I see why Geeks like it. Many Geeks hail Magic: the Gathering as the Godfather of all games, and RftG plays very similarly. Almost all the cards are unique, which grants players flexibility in adapting their strategy. Although I enjoy this game, I actually see the diverse cards as a weakness. Because the 100+ cards are practically all unique, there is no way to predict what you will draw and therefore it is difficult to adapt a strategy. Yes, this randomness creates a "race-like" feel of I-need-to-capitolize-on-EVERY-move-better-and-quicker-than-my-opponent, but it also reduces player interaction to zero. Nothing you can do can influence your player beyond making them consume goods (which, if they are awake during the game will identify this threat and either be fine with it as they cash in their goods for VPs or they will be pre-emptive and trade their goods for cards anyway). Also, because of the iconography used for identifying each card's unique attributes for a given phase, it gets very confusing and impossible to keep track of what other players are doing (not that it matters much except it lets you see what cards you will never have in your own hand). In addition, I don't think I can introduce this game to non-gamers because of the 100+ unique cards with 100+ unique phase icons, which are NOT intuitive. I enjoy San Juan a lot and do not think RftG is superior, as many Geeks do. I'll play either, but I'm gonna give RftG more table time to see if my opinion of it changes.
***UPDATE: I have tried to find fault in this game and realized that for as much as I try to find why I feel this game is overrated, I find myself wanting to play it CONSTANTLY! This one is one of my wifes favorites and I finally admit that this game is really great! Once you've figured out the gameplay (I used San Juan as reference when teaching my wife) and the icons this game plays fast. My wife and I play games nightly and our new routine has changed from "what game do you want to play?" to "what game do you want to play AFTER Race for the Galaxy?". The diversity of cards offers EXTREME replayability and a sense of anticipation as you use that explore +5 phase card to go searching for that crucial card to complement your current tableau and strategy, or that VP x2 phase card to turn your goods into points before your opponent gets around to using the crucial card they were using the explore +5 phase card to find! 
BOTTOM LINE: This game is a fast, competitive and FUN game with nail-biting suspense and tough decisions with a little luck thrown in to fray your nerves a bit.

I enjoyed my first game much more than the second one.  I won the first so that might have helped. :)  In the second game I just didn't get cards that worked together very well.  And it was very frustrating that there was absolutly nothing I could do to slow down the leader to give me a couple extra turns, which may have helped me get a little closer to the winner's score.

RATING: 8
A little too abstract to be instantly compelling for casual players.  Complex and challenging.  Great mechanics.  The design is clever, but not as intuitive as games like Puerto Rico or Stone Age that make more sense right away (due to the great visuals + text combination)  Race for the Galaxy has the text, but the visual components need to be learned and memorized, as they aren't as obvious right away.  (For example, a circle and diamond to differentiate worlds and developments, and different glows or colours on the circles to show a world type.  Also actions like Consume are very themed, and not instantly recognizable.  It's a little easier to teach someone Puerto Rico, and even easier to teach Agricola or Stone Age, that have rich Visuals that just make sense with the game mechanics.

Preliminary rating. I like the game at first (theme is nice, nice artwork, great components). The amount of symbols is overwhelming and a bit harder to learn. Even my friend, who played it already more often, had to look up certain symbols. I can imagine that this is an obstacle everybody talks about.

The gameplay itself is really nice. You need to think more about what card to play then, say, in 7 Wonders or Dominion. Then there is also the choice of action: not only to play your card, but also a bit reading of the opponent (and working against him/her).

My rating may go up with more plays.

Edit: played it once more. The game starts growing on me, but still I think learning all the symbols makes this a harder game and should be played more just to get over the 'learning the symbols' phase. Due to this the game tends to be slow when I take a turn. :)

Edit2: I thought about this game. Downgraded my rating because of the chaos. I like the combination of drafting and paying for it with cards, together with choosing a role, but the huge amount of possibilities makes it a bit chaos for me.

Amazing, fast-playing simultaneous action selection card game. That action selection scared me at first, as I LOATHE Puerto Rico and San Juan. Here, for some reason it works, and it works wonderfully. It can take awhile to understand the iconography, but its worth the effort. Just the right mix of strategy and tactics. The only real player interaction is in trying to judge and make use of what actions they will select, but doing so well can be advantageous.

Roll for the galaxy is just so much more streamlined, without the cumbersome useless, convoluted rules Race has.  I feel like if they re-did Race with some of what I find convoluted reduced it would be better.  The military purchase is unique but it's hard to pull off due to luck- I went through back to back 8 card draws and only the 16th card finally had a military point to spend.  There was just NO other method to get there and it seems like you have very little control compared to Roll.  In fact a strategy seems to be to force people to consume goods they'd otherwise sell for cards or double their victory points on.  I also don't like not being about to do what you need (consume a brown good for cards) unless you happen to drawn and are able to build that as a part of your engine- after which it can be used against you whenever a good is present.  The whole produce coming after consume is weird too, having learned roll it seems to make more sense to produce then consume which allows you to pull it something off in one round with a bit of luck in your opponent's phase pics, but it's based on getting lucky enough to draw something and be able to build it just to be able to do it on a subsequent turn from producing.  So a solid 5.  Would be 8 or 9 with a re-think.

I don't HATE it, but I can't say that I enjoy it at all either.  When it comes time for us to pick a game, I make mile-a-minute suggestions so that no one can squeeze this game's name in edgewise and if the game DOES get mentioned, I'll still make alternate suggestions rather hopefully...pleadingly.  I grasp the rules, but I also feel as though I'm missing some crucial bit of strategy, even when I win.  I really don't like CCGs and this is much the same in that I feel as though I should study/really know the deck to play intelligently.

I used to really like Race, but I'm over 30 plays in and it never stopped feeling like multiplayer solitaire.  It just doesn't have enough direct interaction for my tastes.  Gave it away, but still happy to play it now and then.

And for actual solitaire, I prefer the VPG States of Siege games.

I've played this mostly with programmer types and we've all found the iconography to be very easy to grasp.  (The former art teacher had a different experience.)  I wish Infernal Contraption had a similar system.

The rules are great for reference, but they're lousy for teaching you how to play the game.  A few sample rounds played solitaire will make things crystal clear, however.

The expansions started going downhill after the second one. Ultimately you realize that it's simultaneous solitaire, but interesting simultaneous solitaire.

I have the following expansions:
* The Gathering Storm expansion
* Rebels vs Imperium
* Brink of War
* Alien Artifacts

Walked through a game of this with Kat; we played against the robot.  During play, I made lots of comparisons to San Juan.  Symbols on cards will take more plays to get used to.  Really love the robot - I wish more games had this feature.

Fantastic. So much game in such a small, quick package. It's a bear to learn and teach though.  My wife is unwilling to climb the learning curve so I have trouble getting it to the table.  But I'm playing the app all day long, which is a phenomenal implementation.

Several of my friends really love this game, and I don't. 

Reading several reviews and forum threads, and while I can appreciate the depth of gameplay I'm not interested in playing and losing 100 times just to maybe be able to win against my more experienced friends. Similar to Magic: The Gathering in that regard.

RATING: 7
It is less complicated than it looks. However my attention was totally occupied by my own cards (reading the symbols and catching up different rules) that I was unable to care what other players were doing for the WHOLE game. Such experience is rare to me. I even didn't take a look to which card other player has played. Of course I believe advanced players need to read the situation of other players in order to play well. However, reading cards played by other players is not convenience because of the interface design of the game (everyone play cards in front of him/her). 
The "war"/occupying phase is not as exciting as its name suggests. C'on, there should be at least some casualties after war.
These reasons made me think that RftG is decent but not great, though apparently it is as addictive as CCG. 
I gave it a low rating using BGG's scale since  this kind of game isn't interesting unless playing it many times to understand the system. I'd rather steer away from it.

Because of the addictive AI, I am fairly familiar with most cards now. I still think it is not easy to read the cards played by other players in case I play it face-to-face with them.

I have only played one time but I found the different actions somewhat fiddly.  The winning player (who played twice before) won with almost 50 pts... compared to the next closest 18.  I am not sure if he just got some super combo or what happened?  At any rate this play left me sour on the game.  I think it might be neat on some levels but I think I would much rather play San Juan - the simplicity in that game is genious.

RATING: 5
01/08/08 Played a four player game. As many have said, Race for the Galaxy is a much more complicated San Juan. 01/19/08 Played a three player game. Its OK, but I prefer San Juan. Race for the Galaxy strains my brain too much for a card game. 03/11/08 Another three player game. Still struggling with the mechanics. 04/15/08 A four player game. I still struggle with the meanings of the multitude of tiny icons. 06/17/08 A three player game. I'm still floundering in the mechanics. I now have serious doubts I'll ever grok this game. Therefore I'm lowering my rating from 7 to 6. I'll still play it, but only to placate the owner. I don't hate it, but its no joy for me. 07/15/08 My sixth game, another 3 player affair. Eh. 11/04/08 My seventh game; four player. Just went thru the motions, not caring how I did. Each time I'm coerced into playing it my opinion of it goes down. Lowering my rating from 6 to 5. 02/21/09 My eighth game, three-player. I still feel this game is mostly drudgery. Even the people that have played much more than me have to constantly consult the rule book to decipher the multitude of icons, and how they relate to one another. That's ridiculous when some of them have played well over two dozen times. That just proves my point, this game is tedious.

I am a player of almost any kind of games.  I love abstracts, I love fun games, familial games, tactical ones, etc.  But Race for the Galaxy got me hooked.  It took 2 games but I was like a northern pike who was presented with a baby trout.  I can't resist...and frankly I don't want to resist.  This is the first game that makes that funny feeling in my stomach in a long, long time.  The games are always different.  There is a ton of strategy involve.  It's a subtle game of reading the mind of the opponent and it catters the gamer in me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Wow, I really suck at this game. After 10 plays, I still don't get how to combo up, nor do I understand how to plan ahead. I have won one game by employing an extremely linear and obvious military strategy and being lucky enough to develop lots of might right off the bat, then drawing military world after military world, and gazumping people off military worlds they owned. It was a very low scoring game, too - I won with 35 points. That strategy didn't work again as no-one holds on to military worlds now when I play (!). 

I don't know if it's just that this isn't how my brain works or what, but none of the iconography clicks in for me. Everyone else seems to have left me standing.

After almost 40 plays now, I've won twice. My second success was another low scoring affair - I won with 31 points this time, so feel it was probably down to poor card draws for the others.

I think this is a much more interesting game than, for example, Dominion, where the variation seems to come from using different combinations of card stacks, whereas the combos possible in RftG have much greater flexibility and possiblity - if only I could exploit this during play...

[Update:] This is now by far my most-played game with over 70 plays. That's not to say it's my favourite - I have others I prefer - but it's quicker than my top games and is easy to carry around. I am now managing a win for every 10 games(ish), which is poor, but an improvement.

[22/11/16] Nothing quite like a new RftG expansion to bring you down with a bump. Having played 7 games with Alien Artifacts, I'm surprised how different the sameness is. What's interesting is that I thought I had a handle on the mechanisms, where I understood the fundamental interactions; but it turns out I just understood the interactions of the previous cards through experience. There's nothing intrinsically different about AA, but I've lost my edge. This is a good thing from the point of view of interest and replayability, but somewhat disappointing from that of perceived expertise. Oh well... onwards.

RATING: 10
Being a fast and dangerously addictive game this is probably my most played one, and after two years we still find new combos and strategies. 
Two of it's most addressed flaws are the complicated iconography and the multiplayer solitaire aspect. It surely does require some effort to pick up the game's logic, but after that it's pretty straightforward and intuitive. Any new cards can be deciphered at a glance, as it contains every information you need in a consistent way, so there's no need for further elaboration. [i](unless it introduces some new core mechanism, of course)[/i].
Regarding the lack of interaction, you certainly can play it looking just your cards- if you aren't in it for the win. However you should look your opponents' cards for two reasons. For effective play you have to guess what phase the others will select and then select yours accordingly, and you have to recognize certain patterns to counter them in time, changing your strategy if needed.

Such a dense game in a tiny package.  The (seeming) difficulty and number of plays it takes to get comfortable with the flow of play and contents of the deck are well worth the number of rewarding plays once you arrive at the place of playing on a very competitive level.  2 player duels are amazingly tight, and can provide a great white knuckle experience as you try to blend available gambits to build point trees, cut off your opponent, and push the game towards its end in your time.

Phase-driven deck drawing card game where players choose phases hidden from each other and everyone performs only and all the phases selected. The theme integrates well with the mechanics and there are a few alternate routes to victory. Has a race game hiding at its core, but one with some strategic depth and a controllable amount of luck. While the game itself is mid-complexity, some rules and some card effects are mind-twisting and confusing and takes time to grasp and cope with. Virtually no direct player interaction but fast play times and reasonably interesting build options makes for a reasonably decent game.

Upgraded to a 9 after several more plays. This game hits the sweet spot.  It is fast, playing out in under an hour, yet complex with loads of interesting decisions in a science fiction setting which I love. Almost no take that game play which makes it very spouse friendly, yet there is interaction because you get to play off your opponent's orders.  Your spouse will like it because she can build her little empire without you trying to wreck it. And you'll like it because the game is designed in such a way you can always make something work no mater what cards you're getting.

RATING: 6
This game definitely feels exactly like what San Juan should've been.  In San Juan, I always feel like there isn't enough time to actually play the cards I want and I end up simply being at the mercy of the cards in my hand, but with Race, I've generally been able to plan out strategies, execute them well enough, and have a decent chance of winning the game.  I like that there's a distinction between military planets, non-military planets, and developments, which allow you a variety of methods for building, and I especially like that the military buildings don't require discarding cards from your hand.  There's a large diversity of cards and abilities that can be found in the deck, which numerous choices about which strategy to pursue.  However, I've become tired with it as the additional expansions have greatly increased the "race" aspect of the game and limited the engine-building aspect.  My rating has been dropping as I'm just no longer excited to play this game. I guess this type of game just doesn't really appeal to me.

The first few times I played this I really didn't like it and traded it away.  I saw the similarities to San Juan but already loved that game and this one just seemed too convoluted by comparison.  I came back to it a year or two later and quickly came to appreciate it.  It feels like a good mix between San Juan and Eminent Domain, but they're all different enough to stand on their own.  I like that other players can't directly interfere with my plans, but it's still interactive in trying anticipate other players' actions.  I haven't explored the expansions, but even just the base game is very satisfying once you get past the 1-2 game learning curve.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
I think this rating will go up as I get to play it more and get to know the strategies.  As it is now, I enjoy trying to come up with the best strategies I can using the cards in my hand and tableau, and trying to guess what the other person will do to piggyback off their moves.  

Downside to the game is the high barrier for entry, which means there aren't too many people that I know that I can play it with. (Pretty much me meg and nate... probably orlando and eliany... and that's about it.  Maybe Meghan and Matt if we continue to convert them into gamers)

*Edit: Bumped this up to a 9... now that we have the rules down we can play quick and focus on our strategies.  Really fun game.

First, the iconography is not that hard nor is the gameplay difficult. Pick a phase, do all selected phases in order - get a bonus if you picked it and that's it. The card layout is about as good as it gets for helping you along. With the Consume phase, where you gain points and cards by using up goods, it can get a bit fiddly since suddenly the order in which you do the actions matter a bit. Either way, not that hard to learn and really quite enjoyable - this is a real engine-building game but due to the player controlled end conditions (grabbing all the available points or reaching a 12 size tableau) you can't build it without considering the tempo as dictated by all the players in the game, you need to adapt so that you won't be stuck with nothing as the game ends, or fizzle out too early allowing the other players do massive final turns.

It's a 7 for now, but I can see it trending up if I play it more. I like it - it feels more mathy and calculable, but also more granular and consistent than Mottainai which is my closest comparison, so while similar one is wacky and chaotic the other is more subdued and calculating, I like both. Good game!

This gets a preliminary 8 after two plays. It's a pretty deep game that I think can outlast San Juan pretty easily (I think I rated it a 7, but can't remember).Update: Good, starting to feel like San Juan though, which isn't terrible, but I tired of that pretty quickly. I think I need to play more 4-player games.Update: I'm fickle, I'm back on the bandwagon. Just when I think I've exhausted a strategy, something new pops up. Good game, superior to San Juan. I've never played Puerto Rico but this piques my interest. Update: Bumped up to a 9 after 50 recorded plays (accurate count is probably in the 70s).

Update: maybe shelf this one till the expansion comes out. It did last 100+ plays.

Game in a Nutshell: Select a role each round and play the actions within what roles were chosen by the group. Settle planets, produce goods, and trade or sell your wealth to come out as the player with the most impressive collection of planets.

Played as: 2,3 player

Pros: Well done roles and mechanics make a nicely balanced game given so many options. Game plays fast but with enough different cards, there's variety pretty much every time. Refreshing theme amongst so much same, same. Scales well from 2-4, or at least it appears that way to this point. 

Cons: Totally frustrating to learn. The privileges awarded by planets and technologies are far from intuitive leaving it utterly painful to encourage play after the first struggles through the game. Playing a game shouldn't feel like taking a test.

Other: Got this and played it before I lucked into getting San Juan. This is by far the more complex game if by interface alone. For a 'family' game San Juan is the way to go. This is more of a quick gamers version. I liked the game less before I started to like it more. My learning curve ended up being 4-5 games, though I'm still learning some details here and there.

Best Use: I'll put it in the small group, 30 minute filler / time killer category.

4/26/09: First play with my wife. Wow, it's a bear. Each of us was getting a little frustrated trying to figure out all the symbols on the cards and what each did in the appropriate phase. And then remembering if a card in our tableau offered a bonus during a phase. Whew.

We're fans of San Juan and are able to see the comparisons quite easily, but there is a lot more going on in Race for the Galaxy.

Will play again...definitely.

11/29/12: Played again, finally. Three players this time. We needed to re-learn the game since it had been so long. I'm still frustrated and irked that I couldn't even begin to determine a strategy because I was too overwhelmed with learning the symbols, cards, powers, etc. I know it will get easier.

Horrible, horrible graphics. What idiot puts 8pt(?) black type on a grey background, on a black card? And don't any of those planets rotate to a light side?
The game is OK, with a huge random factor, but it's not a pleasant visual experience for a game where you must refer to cards all the time. With 50yr old eyes it seems I must forget about seeing my opponents options, even at less than a metre away. I cannot believe they pitched these graphics outside an experienced playtest team. There are 'pretty' pictures looming in the darkness. But I want mid size print and a small picture, because the PICTURES DON'T MATTER,INFORMATION DOES! End of rant, what a disappointment. 2nd edition cards please.
Only played twice. Nasty rating coming if patience doesn't pay off.

Updated: Superb game for its quick play time and deep strategy. After many plays, I feel that I just get by, by the skin of my teeth. It's terrific with 2, but is also great with 3 and 4.  With 2, I am beginning to wonder if it becomes too much of a zero sum game, but so far it remains fantastic.

I'd rate this a perfect 10 except that it really is best with players who know the game.  With that said, I've had a lot of luck introducing this to new players.

I bought this at BGG.CON after getting schooled in it by sshawmd.

I didn't expect to like this as much, especially when I realized I was in over my head during that first game. But I "got" it enough to at least form a strategy, however weak, toward the end. I think the mechanics are excellent, and it appears to be deep with lots of viable strategies. I'm looking forward to not sucking at this any more.

Oddly, I was even more overwhelmed during a second play of this. I was rusty enough that I felt like I was completely re-learning it. Also, my group played [i]really, annoyingly[/i] fast, so I didn't have a chance to think and absorb the way I wanted to. And when I drew a bunch of high cost cards that I couldn't play early, then draw nearly an entire hand of high cost alien worlds that I couldn't settle using my colony drop ships...aaaaargh!!!!

I managed to win my third game, by luck I think.

This seems to be a supremely frustrating game, but I clearly need to play more to just get to the point where I feel competent. I'm not sure that I'll ever play this often enough that I feel like I have a good handle on the strategies. But I'm [i]willing to [/i]play it more often than the opportunity comes up.

I ended up trading all my RftG stuff away. When I go that long trying unsuccessfully to convince myself to like something, there's obviously a disconnect. So I said bye bye, and I haven't missed it.

A very fun "tableau-building game".  I guess that is what you would call it?  Because there are two end game scenarios (get all victory points from pool or somebody builds a 12-card tableau), it really does feel like a race.  You are trying desperately to see a strategy come to fruition while at the same time constantly re-evaluating your situation due to the time factor and other players' strategies.  Really solid game that would be a solid 8+ if it weren't for the entirely too confusing symbols (iconography). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a solid game with lots of good decisions. The "select a role no one else can use" part of the game isn't my style of player interaction. The timing of when you draw your 6 point buildings and what they are have a notable impact on your game play, and I'm not sure that's a benefit. (After 30 plays)

The first time I played this, I was lost.  The second time (unfortunately, months later) I was again lost.  And yet I can't help thinking that if I played enough of it, I'd probably grow to like it quite a bit.  It takes a few games to understand how the different phases work, and how to win via different strategies.  The space theme is fairly rich, but comes off as cold to me.  The overwhelming and initially baffling use of symbols makes the game feel colder still.  It would probably only take another couple of games for me to get "in the groove" with this game, but my wife hasn't enjoyed it at all.  So that's that.

I can see this is a well designed game, but I just didn't like it that much. It seemed to have a fairly game-card specific learning curve, where if you don't have all the cards memorized you won't beat someone who does. I didn't like that aspect of the game. I generally don't like card-only games, and this sort of fits into that category.

I've been "seriously" gaming for 10+ years, played nearly 1000 different titles and for the first time, without equivocation, I can answer the "What's your favorite game?" question.   An [b]outstanding[/b] game in the style of San Juan (actually it's the other way around).  The art is exceptional.  The game is fast, but full of compelling tactical options, interesting combinations, engaging thematic elements and numerous strategies to pursue.  In the less than a year since it's been out, it's become my 3rd most played game ever and I have no doubt it will be the most played before long. 

EDIT/UPDATE: >5 years after I wrote this comment and all of the above remains true, and it's become my most played game.  I mostly only play with the first two expansions, without takeover rules, but enjoy all of the expansions.

Amazing game.  Space-themed.  Uses selection of turns played (explore, develop, settle, consume, produce).  The goal, of course, is to collect the most victory points.  However, does not use any tokens for payment, you use the cards in your hand themselves to pay for different worlds and development cards.  In other words, this game is light since it's only cards and VP chips.  Good even for two people if you choose two phases at a time.

Plays fast, allows for a wide range of strategies, and lots of agonizing decisions on which cards to keep and/or play.

Very subtle strategy and the uniqueness of the settlement cards make for a lot of variety from game to game.  I do agree with the people who claim it feels like multiplayer solitaire at times, but I'm looking forward to the interactive expansion to fix this.  As it stands, the game is still about many choices that are affected by the other players at the table.  The more you play, the less it feels like solitaire.

Wow.  Late to the party, but I love this one...

It's an engine-building card game with tons of depth to explore.

One note - within 3 games, my wife and I had mastered the icon system/symbology.  What at first seemed overwhelming, very quickly became routine.  

A second note - the instructional videos on BGG are very helpful.  I did watch a couple different videos before we tried to play, and the videos definitely helped us to learn the symbology more quickly.

02/06/2013: I have not played this with other humans yet.  And probably won't...at least for the foreseeable future.  However, this is a very deep, strategic card game.  There are many paths to follow in terms of gaining VP.  The sci-fi theme, I think, really shows with the artwork and as you build up your tableau of cards in your play area.

The iconography and sheer number of cards / options can be a steep learning curve, but it's well worth the effort.

A little overwhelming upon first glance but once you start playing you realize that it's a tightly designed game where each of the many mechanisms fit in elegantly.  I lost my first couple of games because I tried to build a strong, efficient engine.  In this game you need to burn some of your good cards, that would improve your long-term productivity, in order to gain victory points.  I feel that it's the "race" aspect of the game that really helps make it unique.  Otherwise it would just be another euro/engine-builder.  The problem with my engine strategy is once it was built the game was over before I had a chance to churn it for VPs.  Some players will notice that the game provides minimal direct interaction.  Perhaps the expansions will "fix" this.

UPDATE: Great game but I'm less excited about playing each time it's brought up (which is often).  Bumped down a point.

UPDATE: Bumped back up a point after playing the 2-player version a number of times.  In a 2-player game, despite the quick play time, as you have more actions and control you get to pump your engine a few times and your decisions re: which actions help you more than your opponent are much more transparent.

Today this became my most-played game, beating the much shorter Schotten-Totten. Just love this game.

Recently played a 4-player drafting variant and it was great fun. Breaks a little the random exploration part but allows for really powerful decks. Basically you draft from packs of n+3 cards where n is number of players. All cards drafted together form your own draw deck. Then play normally. Right, forgot, you do know the goals and your two options for a start world beforehand.

Playthroughs: 6, with experienced players and newer ones. Some plays were with the first expansion.

Pros: Cool pictures and large variety of cards leading to varied gameplay.

Cons: Low player interaction- primary mechanic gives you little way to interact with the other players. You can frequently hose yourself but rarely hose the other players, even if you figure out their strategy. Its basically advanced solitaire. Expansion adds small competition for victory chits, which reduce but certainly don't alleviate problem.
High confusion level- I say confusion level instead of complexity because the rules are not very complex. However, the game is presented in a very poor manner that leaves you constantly looking through your hand and board trying to figure out what you can do. There are many symbols that can mean different things depending on where they are on the card. The game 

Overall, everyone leaves the game dissatisfied, feeling as if they have wasted time, even the winner. Do not buy this game. I earnestly wonder why it is highly rated.

I hate the iconography, which rarely seems to matter other than indicating when the power is used, making the game harder to learn than necessary. Other than that, an excellent exercise in adapting to an ever changing series of options. It feels a bit like a drafting game, but rather than passing cards off, you have to throw cards away in order to pay for others. Very clean, super replay-able. Though sometimes card draws can really screw you, especially if the 1 card you need is sitting as a resource for another player and you waste time digging through the deck for it.

Someone took Puerto Rico and Dominion and turned them into a great strategy game that plays differently every time. How you start ultimately affects how you will play, there's a number of different types of strategy, and flexibility is always key.

That said, you'll hate it at first. The hieroglyphs they splatter all over every card are completely unintuitive, and you need to be told about the 4 playstyles to stand a chance.

Loving this game right now. So many unique cards yet they are all variations on a theme. Card draw is so random yet the rate at which you power through the deck, throwing away anything you don't want to fuel what you do, strategy will always win out. And that strategy must vary game to game, responding to what others are doing. Further, leeching action selection is such a fun form of interaction and underappreciated in my mind. I want to get this to the table more.

Excellent game - moves fairly quickly due to the role selection mechanic, which I love. Fairly complex strategy; though luck plays a role (it is a card game), it usually isn't too noticeable - you always have something you can do.

The game has a steep initial learning curve due to the iconography, which - though it eventually makes sense - is not immediately intuitive. Experienced players also have a huge advantage over new players due to card knowledge.

These drawbacks only apply to the first few games - the only long term knock against it is the lack of confrontation. This is somewhat mitigated by the expansions, and that won't even be a drawback.

It also scales down to two players quite well, which is rare.

Making your cards work together is the challenge here. The first time I played this I was completely unimpressed; the second time I played it, well, we played 7 games back-to-back.  This game has eaten one of my gaming groups...  it gets played in every session. 

I can't imagine playing with just the base game any more. However, the sweet points appear to be the first expansion and the 3rd, so my recommendations, in order, would be: 

All three expansions
Base game plus RvI
Base game plus first two expansions
Just the base game  

I play with goals about half the time, and almost never use the combat system.  Fans of combat would certainly have different opinions than me.

A card game with a science fiction theme, where the theme really doesn't have anything to do with the game.  But the pictures on the cards a well done, and got universal approval from the players present.  Rated after 3 games.  RftG is a played with an initial set up of cards, with each player picking an action card for each turn.  Players get bonuses for their action cards, but may still play on other players actions, but without the bonus.  Players attempt to score the victory points in varies manners to win the game.  First game can be VERY confusing, but with further play the confusion diminishes and some elements of strategy can be tried.  Strategy is limited somewhat by the luck of the draw, but hey thats cards right? Yet as with any card game, players can minimize the luck with some insight into what the values of the cards and their interaction represent.  RftG game play is quick, and overall game time short.  I found the game surprisingly enjoyable, and RftG will be one of my choices for a filler in an evening of gaming!

I rank it this high because of its versatility with # of players and the game length is superb.  I do feel like I am expanding my universe.  Biggest issue is teaching it to new players can be very difficult.  They have to be willing to play 2-3 games before giving their opinion on the game.

The idea of creating a complex cardgame while avoiding cascades of text on it appeals to me.
The icons have to be learned , which might take a few plays. The reward is an elegant game which lets me forget San Juan.

I didn't find this game to be overly complex at all.  I also didn't find it to be 'amazing' either.  Still, it has earned a spot in my collection, for now, as it is a very portable 2 player.  Don't know how long it will last though since once you know the varying strategies it gets pretty boring just exploring through cards looking for what you need.  It's still ok, but very mechanical.

With time, I came to realize that I truly disliked this game.  I disliked the almost cliquey nature of the hieroglyphic symbols on the cards ("Well, if you don't know what they all mean, then you obviously aren't smart enough blah, blah, blah...").  I would play its far more elegant and user-friendly cousin, [b][GameID=8217][/b], every day and twice on Sunday over this sacred cow of BGG.  Thus, its banishment...

I played this because Ryan's played it a few thousand times already, and he recommended it to me.  This game uses the same mechanics as San Juan, but is incredibly different from (and much more complicated than) it.  This is not a beginner's game: virtually none of the 100  cards are duplicates of each other, each card can typically do multiple things (in one of five phases), and there is a strong component of experience in the game (due to needing to know what cards are available, though there's also luck, evidenced by my winning the first game I played).  I love it; there are enough different cards to make multiple strategies effective, you have to tactically respond to the cards you get, and while it doesn't have a lot of player interaction, the role selection mechanic requires considering what other people will select. 

Edited to add: I've now played this twelve times (including the expansion), and I still love it. My group has gotten very experienced at this game, and thus we can play through it very quickly, making it very enjoyable even though it's clear that luck plays a decently large role.

RATING: 8
Haven't completely wrapped my head around this one yet, but so far it's a deep yet short building and production game. I love that, because it enables you to learn from the previous game and immediately apply what you've learned. Knowing all cards by heart does seem like a prerequisite to be any good though.

RATING: 6
Pick actions to improve your galactic civilization for most points.

Plays: More than 100, most against Keldon’s AI.
Type: VP engine = a game where you build an engine to collect victory points most efficiently.
Complexity: Medium.
# of players: 2-4.
Playing time: 30 mins.
Player interaction: Competition for unlimited resources – actions. Opportunity prevention.
Randomness: Medium – card draw.

Replayability: High against AI. This is one of the few efficiency engine games that I actually enjoy, probably because decisions involve dealing with uncertainties, which makes it not just an equation. Face to face replayability is not so high, as there's too much to keep track of with action cards, cards in hand, goals, card powers in play and victory chits. Having the computer to keep track of everything makes the experience more about decisions and less about "maintenance".
Fun: The fun lies in the decision making of hand and board management. Packs complex decisions into a quick game, which is nice.
Memorability: Low, it’s an efficiency engine that doesn’t create stories.

Thematic integration: Weak.
Components: Decent. 
Expansions: The Gathering Storm is a welcome addition to meaningful decision making. Others I’m not sure.

Who will like this: Strategy gamers, especially to play solitaire against AI.

Wow, this game saw constant play the year it came out. It never seemed to exhaust itself- game after game after game, it maintained its pull for me and mine. It's been on the shelf for awhile now, but not because it somehow played itself out or exposed itself as a lesser design; new games just arrived and we all thought Race would make a triumphant return sooner or later. Now, though, I wonder why we haven't returned to it. Hmm.

RATING: 8.5
Adjusting my rating from October 2013 of 9.1 down to 8.5 - this game is complicated enough to teach, and gets crazy with all the expansions added.  I still love the game, I just never get the chance to bring it to table because of the above.

This game is a doozy at first, because the creators went hogwild with the iconography.  There is a symbol for everything, not all of which is especially intuitive, and sometimes there are symbols which don't make any sense at all in the context of what you're doing.  Then you have some words delineated with colored text... some of which work in the base set (eg "Alien") whereas some don't do anything until you start adding expansions (eg "Imperial").

All of that said and meant: this game is a delightful space empire builder that encourages multiple different paths to victory, and one which can see your strategy shift from the beginning of the game, to game's end, based on what you draw.

Even still: check out Eminent Domain for a more approachable game in the same genre.

Wow.  Having played twice, really, REALLY difficult to imagine never wanting to play this.  Obviously, San Juan on ultra steroids, and all the good things that people have already said. . .but the theme and the storylines that get baked into the game are just brilliant - from asymetrical starting worlds, to different tech "paths" based on early decisions (that sometimes reduce your military or other powers), each player ends up with a vastly different experience and potential victory.  Highly recommended for a gaming crew that has played some gateway games and are looking for MORE.

*updated*

Still an awesome game two more plays later.  Don't know if I need to address naysayers on this column about the "solitaire" - uh, no, "solitaire" is to complete or clear a board - there is a "race" here - which means you might have to make "blunt" or sub-optimal moves to stay "in" the race - and the "ESP" involved is to figure out what others might play so that you can get the extra mileage on your turn. . .not to mention, if you take a similar "route" of expansion, you are then competing with that player(s) for cards, when taking a different route might be better. . . .
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
This game feels like it was tailored exactly to my tastes and pulls the best that card games like this have to offer.  It seems extremely balanced and the replay value is way off the charts.  The only major downside is the learning curve, which prevents me from teaching it to a lot of people.  I have not found the form of player interaction to be a problem and prefer it to direct clashes between players.

My rating has gone up every time I played.  I'll be picking up a second copy at some point, since the first one is going to wear out eventually.

My one criticism: the icon system is a barrier for entry, and very intimidating for the first game.  However, after a couple of games, it all makes sense.  I do wish there was more text on the cards and less artwork, though.  Lots of tough decisions, and the game seems to play out differently each time.

Note: the game is very, very similar to San Juan in many aspects, but Tom Lehmann was involved in making SJ, and has permission for this version - I reckon they should have put the design story in the manual, though, because it looks like blatanyt plagiarism without the context.

Szárazabb tablóépítés, mint mondjuk egy Imperial Settlers, de összetettebb is nála, elég mély taktikai lehetőségekkel. Műfajában az egyik legjobb, még akkor is, ha még a sokadik partinál is bele kell nézned a játékszabályzatba, mert annyi az ikon és a kivétel, hogy képtelenség néhány játék után mindegyiket fejben tartani.

Kezdőknek nem ajánlanám, de aki már játszott legalább kétféle tablóépítővel (pl. Imperial Settlers vagy 51st State, esetleg 7 Wonders), az nyugodtan fusson neki. Csak fel ne adja a halom piktogram miatt...

Good game. It took me a long time to try it because 2 things made me wary: the sci-fi theme and the comparisons to San Juan. After one play I'm intrigued and anxious to learn the game.

My wife enjoys the game and so do I. I find this much more compelling than San Juan for some reason. 

My wife and my friend Carl are so-so on the game. Anyone outside of my group who wants to play has played a thousand games and squashes me. *sigh* It seems like you need someone who is willing to learn the game and grow along with you. Disparity in experience level makes a huge difference in this game.

The game has clicked for my wife and I. We are playing the balls off of this game. In the space of about a month, Race has become our most played game.

Race for the Galaxy seemed like godsent when it appeared - an improvement over San Juan, with a nice scifi theme to boot.

Two expansions later I'm thinking San Juan might still be the better game of the two, as it's cleaner and more elegant. Race for the Galaxy feels a bit luck-heavy (that's just a feeling I get, caused by my lack of skill).

Also, Race for the Galaxy is simply a pain to play with newbies, which is a big minus.

I've rated it 10, but the rating has since come down a bit. At its best it's still a ten, but those moments are rare enough. I do like the Keldon's AI version, it's a nice little solitaire game to play (and when I say solitaire, I mean it, as I never look at what the computer players do).

Suggest.

Great, great game, my favorite of the decade. I've played a good number of two-player games, and many, many solo games (over 150) with The Gathering Storm expansion: tough to beat the robot, thus very fun indeed. I've also played countless games against the AI online, which is also tough to beat. I have all three expansions, and will buy all future expansions in a heartbeat. (I got an honorable mention in the 3rd expansion rules, of which I am inordinately proud.) [43 non-solo, mostly two-player plays]

RATING: 6
Rating after first game only. I enjoyed this, but was totally overwhelmed by the iconography - especially since the game play is not significantly different than San Juan. Why the hell they couldn't just print text on the cards like San Juan is beyond me. I liked it enough--it left me brainburny and tired, but I don't know how much in demand it will be for my group.
---------
Bumped rating up after two-player game against my son. He was ambivalent about it and said he wanted to play it again before he decided. I, on the other hand, really had the game open up for me somehow this time, and I felt like my head was going to explode. Even though it IS essentially complex solitaire, it is also HIGHLY immersing. So I guess if I can't have conflict based player interaction, I'll take depth.
---------
Another .5 ratings bump after first four-player game. Experience was rich, and far more complex and challenging that the solo and two-player games. 

Still, in spite of the fact that ALL new players were familiar with San Juan, there was a lot of frustration over the complex iconography, and what was perceived to be needlessly complex mechanics in some places. One player's comment was, "they should have spent less time on the art, and more time just writing card text that clearly explained what each card could do. I shouldn't have to play a game like this three or four times to feel comfortable with how it all works."

---------

Nonetheless, I am starting to think this game is superior to Dominion, but I suspect the above noted complexity complaints mean it will see the table far FAR less.

---------

Ok. 35+ plays in. Got the first expansion. Have slowly coaxed the wife into playing it now, and she begrudgingly admits she likes it too. It's in the top 5 now.

---------

Things have kind of fizzled out with this game. The wife now refuses to play it because she feels like she has to relearn the rules every time we sit down to give it a try. None of my guy friends but Josh care for it at all, and he never comes down for gaming at lunch anymore, so I am left with it sitting on my shelf gathering dust. I do really like this, and there is tons of replayability, but its complexity for many of the more casual gamers I tend to game with means it is severely flawed in at least one respect.

----------------

Ratings downgrade after getting Eminent Domain to the table. A superior design revealed the flaws in this one. I strongly dislike having to discard my whole hand to do anything meaningful, and I still believe that this game can be played in a non-interactive bubble, basically ignoring my opponents entirely, and still achieve victory (assuming I get the right cards in hand.) I still like this game, and it gets played, on occasion, at lunch with the kids. But once I get a copy of Eminent Domain, I suspect it might get traded away.

------------------------------------------------

Played more ED - that one may as well be called Erectile Dysfunction. And this one - took it out and played some solo games of it and realized that it otherwise hasn't seen the table in three years. No one else likes it, and the iconography is too much a barrier to entry for new players. Ratings downgraded again. Up for trade.

I like San Juan a lot and I've heard this is San Juan with a space theme and more action since roles are being chosen at the same time rather than one by one.  It seems like something I'm bound to like.

RATING: 6
Took me several two-player playthroughs to learn to like. The first barrier -- and it is a serious barrier -- is the game's ill-designed iconography. Even the iconography of a computer game as sophisticated and icon-dependent as Civilization IV is less complicated to teach and learn. I would love to see this game reissued in five years completely reformatted by professional designers.

The second barrier is the difficulty of figuring out what the game's strategies are. Because your ability to act is based on the cards that you draw, and because a two-player game is unlikely to go through the deck even once, you are generally reacting to the cards that you manage to pull into your hand. While I enjoy a making-the-best-of-what-you've-got game as much as the next person, I'm uncomfortable with the idea of so strategically smart a game as Race for the Galaxy seeming to be so luck-dependent.

Very good adaptation of some San Juan card mechanics, a bit costly here in UK considering it is basically just cards, but it is well worth the $$.

After 3 plays: I want to like it but I'm not catching on that fast and the icons aren't that intuitive for me.  I'm sure it will help a lot after I've read the rules myself because generally people don't explain these things well.  Of course, I already have and really like San Juan, so this one doesn't quite do it for me yet.  But I can see that it has a lot of depth and may be rewarded on further plays.

A complex, deep card game. I find it very fun to have to try and work out a strategy with the hand you're dealt, although some players dislike the game for that very reason.

Difficult to introduce to new players, but I find that more often than not, once they get the rules down, they love it and want to play over and over again.
The supplied cheat-sheets are very useful for beginning players to use to learn the symbols!

Card-sleevers beware: the deck can quickly become enormously tall. This problem can only be made worse by the addition of expansion cards.

The box, standard Rio Grande Games size, is massively too big. Probably the worst (lack of) use of box space I've ever seen.

It's quite complicated to understand the iconography and the way the consume/produce powers work, the military worlds etc. but once you get it, it's really a race to get the most points out of the cards you get. Interesting game that hopefully gets more plays. There isn't much down time with more players because everyone chooses and plays his/her action together. Highly recommended and I'm interested in what the expansions might offer but I need to play the base game more first.

I like Sci-Fi, but I hated the art, theme, and execution in this game.  It builds on the PR, San Juan mechanics, but it just feels fiddlier to me.  I might just be extra negative towards this game because I wanted more conflict.  Doesn't help that it's butt ugly.

Fast-playing San-Juan-like card-based building / resource generation / shipping game. Lots of interesting variation, as many of the card powers are specific to a particular class of good or planet, and two different approaches to "building" planets, either by settling them (with cards) or conquering them with military bonuses.

Great card game. If you're getting bored with SanJuan, you have to try this. The game play is fluent, cards are great-looking, icons are clear, the game is fast. A lot more different cards than San Juan which means a lot more strategies. 

Too bad of the American-style theme on the euro-style mechanics.

Highly recommended.

This is my favorite Eurogame.  It's often compared to San Juan, but RFTG is much more complex (and consequently has a much longer learning curve), and also much more fun.  There are a wide variety of strategies, which helps keep the game fresh (as well as three expansion sets which increase the complexity dramatically).  There is also a great free computer AI that you can practice on, although the AI is so good you'll probably find it very frustrating at first.  If you like San Juan, you have to try RFTG.  You'll probably never want to play San Juan again.

RATING: 6
I really wanted to love this game, but I just can't. I do see the potential for strategy here, but the strategy nonetheless feels like a chore to me. Pick a strategy, then hope for the right cards to come up. If the cards you wanted don't come up, or if your opponent is threatening to end the game before you have time to execute your strategy, change your strategy quick and try to keep up. No matter how adept you become at anticipating and adapting to the events in the game, you are forever just hoping to draw the right cards at the right time. Seemingly, the only difference between a subpar move and a brilliant move is whether or not you subsequently drew the cards you needed.

Update 11/19/2015: I still have the same issues with the strategy-on-rails, but it can be interesting to explore the many different successful strategies you can cobble together from the cards you draw. I still feel like the game is playing me rather than me playing it, but at least (for now) there's some interesting scenery to distract me from the fact that I'm on a train ride.

RATING: 8.9
A great game that is enhanced by its theming.  Role selection has less of a 'denying your opponent' element than Puerto Rico or Citadels.  The fact that cards are also resources keeps players from hoarding, and creates uncertainty in pursuing specific strategies.  This for me changes the game enough with each play to keep it engaging and interesting.

Best as a 2-player game (advanced variant). An amazing, immersive, tableau-building game that finishes in 20 minutes with experienced players.  It's a bear to teach and isn't nearly as fun when you're not using the 2-player advanced variant.

A fast playing card game that has far more depth than is seen at first glance. The game becomes much better with successive plays as you familiarize yourself with the deck. Multiple paths to victory give it high replay value. Just don't make the mistake I did and immediately buy the expansions expecting that more is better. Take your time to really learn each deck before moving on for a much better experience.

For a newcomer who hadn't played San Juan or other games of this type, all the choices and markings on the cards were completely overwhelming.

I really enjoy playing this game. The only downside is it's tough to teach to new players and takes many plays before you start to really develop a feel for the multiple strategies.

Nagyszerű játék!
Nagyon féltem, mikor itthon megmutattam, hogy bonyolult lesz az ikonrendszere miatt, de szerencsére elég volt pár kör, hogy belerázódjunk.
Szép grafikájú kártyák segítségével építhetsz egy kis űrbirodalmat magadnak, fejlesztheted, újabb bolygókat kolonizálhatsz, sőt még harcolhatsz is! A bolygók nyersanyagokat termelnek - egy lapot teszünk képpel lefelé a bolygóra -, majd ezeket fel is dolgozhatod - eldobod róla a lapot. Nagy tematikusságot egy kártyákkal (csak kártyákkal!) operáló játéktól nem várható, de azért nem rossz, végig bolygókról, fejlesztésekről beszéltünk, nem rombuszban és körökben gondolkoztunk. :)
Puerto Rico-szerű akcióválasztás jó, mivel azzal játszottunk, ez sem bizonyult átléphetetlen akadálynak.

This was a hit for me and my wife. I have read in more than one comment that symbols and rules give it a steep learning curve, but this didn't seem so evident in our experience.

I think familiarity will breed a higher rating. The mechanics of the game are super-simple, but I think learning how to use them to your advantage will take quite a while.

RATING: 8
Really fluid empire building game with cards. If you like games where you create the engine that pumps your hand full of cards (resources), this is the game for you. The game icons take a while to get used to but in the end they make sense and are easy to read.

The game is daunting to teach for new players especially if they are not used to this kind of games. Some players may also be annoyed by the fact that this game has very little player interaction.

UPDATE 5/13/2016:
After playing Roll for the Galaxy I had to lower the grade of this game a bit. The new version does so many things right and updates so many things it just feels this game is not as attractive anymore.

Ok, that is unfair. There are lots of them, but for the folks who play it, they learn them and that's that. Will try the dice version. I hear it is more accessible.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I love the base game, and the first 2 expansions; the 3rd one (from the first "Arc") IMO destroys the best aspects of the game, as the prestige-point system rewards winning players (especially militarily powerful ones) and so you have a runaway winner problem, and the game becomes a headachy struggle to rein the leader in.

Roll for the Galaxy is good too, but hasn't clicked with me in the same way as yet.

UPDATE: Still playing this and finally making the jump from mediocre to decent player. There's just so much pleasure to be had from this quick but thinky game. I've found the key piece of advice was: don't worry overmuch about hanging onto exciting cards at the start, just get cards down that are of some utility, get your card-flow happening ASAP, and build from there. (I've learned to love New Military Tactics and Colony Ship for their ability to jump start your tableau by grabbing powerful planets quickly.)

Not nearly as hard to learn as everyone makes it out to be. Good heavens, people... they're just icons. 

This is a great game. Basically, it's what Puerto Rico, San Juan, the Settlers Card Game, Jambo, and others all wanted to be but weren't... a nice, streamlined, balanced, "economic engine" game with multiple layers of complexity and multiple ways to victory.

As Stone Age is to Pillars Of The Earth and Agricola, so this is to San Juan / SoC / Jambo and Puerto Rico.

UPDATE: Rating rose.  I'm finding I look forward to playing this all the time.  The theming and chrome is fantastic!

Rating should rise.  This game just blows away San Juan for me, though the iconography is a bit arcane.  I'm almost afraid to teach friends this game for fear of screwing up the rules.  But a delightfully meaty, short card game.  I look forward to the expansion(s).

RATING: 5.9
Only one play so far, so not rating. I think I really like it, but damned if it doesn't feel too short. This seems to be a common movement now a days though and maybe I just need to get used to it: Right when games seem to get interesting / moving / involved... they end.

UPDATE: Have played this to death on Keldon's AI. Have played with wife a few times. She has no interest in playing again. My interest is also, admittedly, waning. The mechanics to me imply and beg a bigger game that is just not delivered. I understand that was not the intent, but, meh...

Like San Juan but much more interesting. I'd give RftG 10 but -1 because its learning curve is made steeper by the confusing iconography. The problem is that the icons are so abstract that they don't evoke what they intend, making the learning curve worse. Once players become a bit more familiar with the system then there's plenty of depth and replayability to be had in a game that plays in the same time as San Juan. The real fun is making tough choices in making your cards generate VP faster than anyone else. I give RftG an additional -1 because skill is rewarded but winning somestimes just comes down to dumb luck of the draw.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.6
Why make a game unnecessarily difficult to learn? The small font and non-intuitive icons are a lesson in how not to design a game. However, for those who persevere with the learning curve underneath it is a reasonable game which plays quickly.

Great game that captures the 'feel' of building a galactic empire. My only concern is that the game's instant tactical gratification of playing the cards combined with the richness of decisions, almost all of which interesting and pivotal, make the end-game feel unwelcome and invariably rushed. Also, concerning competitive play, card draws can be swingy.

For me this is still the pinnacle of the modern card game designs. 

There are just so play styles and strategic plays to be made. The cards can combo in so many different ways and the action selection...whilst not totally original here...allows for beautiful interplay as the players try to leech off one another and minimise their opponents ability to do so.

The icons and rules as written don't make it an easy beast to love at first (by that I mean the first 30 odd plays) but once a playgroup has come to terms with the basics, there is a universe of good times just waiting to be explored. 

The game definitely gets better with the expansions...at the expense of more complexity at first.

This game requires a few plays plays & knowledge of the cards and tactics to be truly accessible OR players who all are newbies. A few veterans and a single new player is a horrible, horrible situation in this game and probably won't work that well.

I've basically played it with newbies, to whom I taught the game & who were usually overwhelmed by it, even though people seem to like it. So I'm not that good at it: the only time I played against veterans I got destroyed. 

But I have still liked every single game very much. I really dig the feel & the visual style, even though the symbols are confusing / not that good.

Very high learning curve, everything is in symbols and each phase is based on what the players pick. This is a really cool feature, but makes teaching the game to others a lot more tedious.

My rating has gone up from a 7 to an 8 since I'm finally comfortable with being able to decipher the icons.  Playing San Juan a half dozen times or so has probably also helped.

I could see this going up to a 9 in the future.  The game definitely has a steep learning curve (understanding the icons).  But once you get that figured out it's pretty fun.  

Problem is that unless you have a group dedicated to playing this several times in a row and get over the "icon hump" you will never get a chance to see it shine.  And hence, why I decided against purchasing it.

The new Android App now available as of 7/17 is actually Very Good!  Best way to learn and probably play, since all icons on cards are explained with text! Bumping rating up to 9.

2-4 players, although you can play solitaire with one of the expansions (that we have), and I really enjoy it that way.

Pretty cool game. The problem I have with it is it's steep learning curve. It's hard to know what's a good strategy unless you know the many other cards in the deck. Also, if you don't know the game very well it's hard to pay any attention to what your opponent is doing, so it feels a bit like solitaire.

Update: June 2016, 50 games played. Still learning and enjoying the game. I has become one of my favorites. Rating increased to 10. 

It's rich in theme and the playing time is short. There are a lot of different strategies that can be used.

The interaction between players is minimal. But a good player will have to take into consideration the needs of the other players and anticipate their choices.

Wanted this one later than everyone else, and then for a long time. I have to say, I enjoy it considerably... this is only two games in, but if the title holds up to what I read about it, that strategies first start becoming apparent after the third play or so, then I'm in for some gaming goodness.

My wife ALWAYS wins this game.  For some reason my planets producing nothing but minerals and knick-knacks don't lead me to victory.

The symbols and icons in the game are just as bad as most people say (I personally don't find them very intuitive), although you definitely get used to them after a while.

Totally changed my tune on this game. I was initially put off by the iconography, but now with some more plays under my belt, studying the rules more, and most importantly, playing with some great players, I see the light. This game is fabulous - well balanced and filled with lots of interesting challenges. Highly recommended.

RATING: 9
Great card game with absurd levels of depth.  The learning curve is murderous, but the flexibility allowed within the game only becomes apparent a number of plays in.  A less forgiving version of Glory To Rome and San Juan and fully deserving of a place in any serious collection, whether you think you like card games or not.

Expanded in 2014 to include Alien Artifacts, whose cards broaden the experience significantly and add to its depth while not ramping up the complexity too much beyond the base game.  Currently playing this with the (interesting and preferred) advanced 2P version, but yet to throw in The Orb.

I've probably played this a dozen times now, all with 2 players.  After the first couple of games, we switched to the advanced rules, which substantially improved gameplay.

I like trying to plan your actions based on what you predict your opponent will do, and the simultaneous nature of play.  The theme is fun- stacking up a bunch of alien worlds or building a genetics empire is a blast.  The turns are fast, and the tableau card number limit almost always ends our games quickly- it does feel like a race.

I seem to have trouble with certain strategies, and success with others.  I've never gotten a development-based strategy to work, and consumption strategies haven't been dominant even when they have won.  I see military as the easiest path to take.

I find the limited number of starting worlds frustrating.  I don't like starting the game and not necessarily knowing what strategy to pursue, as is often the case with some starting hands and planets.  It's not the uncertainty or the decision I dislike, but rather the feeling of aimlessness even once a decision is made.  Double exploring for the first couple turns often seems best.  I look forward to using the Gathering Storm expansion in the game to increase the number of starting worlds and add new strategies.

It's super fun even for two players. I like different options how to build empire. It seems to me that luck factor is not so significant in this game and it more relies on strategic play. Also you have to determine your opponents actions. It's not so difficult to learn as many say and also the games are pretty fast and packed with fun.

It's a fun fast card game. The rules are simple although some people have problems with remembering the meaning of all the icons. I'm not one of them, but it id take me a couple of games to really get the hang of it. 

Only played 2p so far, so I'm looking forward to play this 4p and find out of it plays so much different.

This is not a filler game. It takes a few practice plays before things really click, but gets very engaging once you are able to formulate strategies. There isn't too much player interaction, but watching your opponent's consume/produce cycle later in the game is important.

Update: Rating increased from 7 to 8. This game gets better the more often I play it.

Okay, after having this up and down on my wishlist I am finally convinced that this game looks awesome. I am really enjoying the cards with multiple uses and the hand management of Lewis and Clark and this is more of the same. Although I am not heavy into the space theme I think this is too cool to pass up.

RATING: 7
It's a good game but I have to point out that it's NOT colorblind-friendly. The cards have really small symbols separated only by color. This means that if you are colorblind like me, you have to mark the sleeves to be able to play it.

It has a neat mechanic where taking an action gives other players the opportunity to do the same action. This means you have to try and exploit those chances to do "free" actions to win the game.

A very well-constructed card game with high replayability. The rules are easy, the icons might be intimidating, but unlike other card and deckbuilding game like Dominion, You need to play this a lot just to understand the viable ways to win. The high learning curve comes from the nature of the game not the icons though. It's a game that people will either like or dislike.

If you are able to surpass the initial learning curve required to actually play this game, can be one of the most satisfying card gaming experiences you will ever have. 

It has a fast paced gameplay (especially 2 player), no waitimes, and a good balance, perfect complexity. Besides, cards have a good quality and they look nice. This game excels at everything.

The only downside would be that it is not easy to get into the game at first (I would advise, keep playing it for at least 5-6 games before letting it go). 
Also, the player interaction is quite low, which I don't mind at all. It just feels right to play these kinda games sometimes, where it's all about fun.

Finally, there are many good expansions that keep this game alive for so many plays.

This game is really growing on me. The first time I played I had no idea what was going on. The symbols didn't make any sense, not knowing the cards in the deck is a huge strategic disadvantage, and in general it's a strange one to teach and learn. The more I play, the more I enjoy how much game there is in such a small package. You have the depth of some much bigger games with simple set up, and less time investment. I haven't tried Roll for the Galaxy yet, but since dice hate me I'll probably stick with this.

Race for the Galaxy is a fantastic game.  Perhaps the biggest compliment I can give it is that I've already played it over 50 times.  It provides a huge amount of depth in a very short game, and it plays really well across its player range.  It is perhaps the pinnacle of what a card game can be; everything that is good and bad about it can be traced to the fact that it is a card game, and the issues that comes along with that.

This is a really fantastic game, and I would recommend it to anyone.  Check it out.

I love light games that have a lot of strategy - this is one. You can play in 30 minutes or less and feel like you played a deep game of space building.

Highly recommended.

By game three, when my novelty goods producing space empire with strong links to trade associations began raking in the VPs, I realized what the fuss was all about. My, what a thrilling, intriguing game! While not terribly original, it is at least a collection of very good parts. The system borrows heavily from San Juan (which I like quite a bit), and the gameplay reminds me of Agricola (which I absolutely adore). So yes, it's another economy engine game, but the parts that make the engine seem to mesh together better than in many similar games I've played. The card powers can be used to complement one another in different ways, allowing various strategies to emerge. Player interaction may not be very overt or obvious, but you'll have to keep an eye on what the other players are doing and adapt your play accordingly. As the name says, it's a race - and letting that race end too soon (or drag on for too long, for that matter) can cost you a lot of points.

Recently upped this puppy from a 9 to a 10.  I have played it over 20 times and still love every game.  I was initially demoed this at BGG con and had to get a copy right away.  I am not a fan of PR but I love SJ, but this to me is a better version of SJ.  Admittedly the first play of the game is rough, but give it a few more and I think you will realize that there IS player interaction...maybe not directly but there is a certain aspect of trying to anticipate your opponents next play.

A lot of people call it "multiplayer solitaire" but not looking at an opponents strategy/cards is the fastest way to a loss...

This game plays great with all players from 2p(advanced rules), 3p and 4p

RATING: 9
Race is fast and fun. Its only disadvantage is that it's hard to feel like you're playing it to its full potential until you know the contents of the deck really well, and that doesn't happen until many games into it.

* * *

Now that there are three expansions out, and I've played Race enough to know the contents of its deck, I really dig it. Like Dominion, you have to build a working engine out of randomly selected components. Race is more ornate because there are more components, and different in that you have specialized access to whatever you draw. Then the phase selection mechanism is fairly unique and adds a lot to the games.

In this space card game, one attempts to settle, develop or conquer planets. Cards are played out of your hand to satisfy the building cost of planets. Each player has a deck of actions to choose from (draw more cards, settle, develop, trade, etc). If other players have chosen different actions, you also get to execute the action, but without the discount associated with choosing the action.

I feel this is the best game of 2007! It's an addictive little card game and I always want to keep playing. The first few games were a bit bewildering to me, but once you understand all the symbols, you start to see all the nuances of each of the cards. We have also played this with 5 players, and it works just as well. I am looking forward to the expansions.

Took me a while (a long while) to grasp the cards and multiple symbols. but once I'd sussed it, crikey, what a game.  A rare game I even win sometimes!

Very clear, precise instructions make it possible to sit down with the manual and get playing.  Once you get into the flow of play the icons and phases crystalise, speeding play and helping a sense of growing empires materialise within the theme.
When I first encountered this game at an expo in 2014, it was a nightmare to wrap my head around although I grasped its potential.  2 years later I've bought it (+ The Gathering Storm expansion) on the basis of that encounter 2 years prior, and a handful of plays of Roll for the Galaxy.  I'm well satisfied with my decision.

It has a very high barrier to entry with all its symbols and is pretty hard for beginners. I feel like I might like it more if I played it enough to get used to the symbols and cards. I like how compact and quick it is, though I wish it could play 5P too, but you need the expansion. Even after playing San Juan a ton and Puerto Rico and studying up on this game, I struggle to successfully play it well, as the icons take a long time to get used to.

It is a multiplayer solitaire. Your choices dont effect your gaming group at all or at least not very much.

Risk 2210 introduced me into the hobby but it was RftG that gave the biggest push.
Difficult to understand at the beginning due to so many symbols (and specially not having any previous contact to action selection games like Puerto Rico and such).
After the initial roadbumps... what a spectacular game!
Now I don't bring it out that much anymore because you really need somebody around the same skill level to have a challenge. And the difficulty to teach someone new and time needed for him to understand how all the cards fit together is too long.
Will still play on occasions at some BG weekly meetings.

Didn't know this was an alternative development of San Juan until I got the chance to play it. Overall I think I prefer the original San Juan because 1) although I can see how the combo-building can appeal to some, the original was just more elegant which is a plus for me and 2) the simultaeneous action selection felt inferior to the original mechanism because we tend to just select what we want to do. I know you can benefit from correctly guessing what other players want to do, but this decision was much more explit and well-informed in the original mechanism. In the end, if you want to play safe, you just do your own thing, which lowers the level of interaction.

In space, no one can hear you scream about how this game is totally undeserving of its high BGG rank and legions of positive comments.  It's not terrible, but it's extremely low on originality, tension, and player interaction.  There are dozens of games with similar durations that I would rather play.

A game that just grows on you the more you play it. After your first few games of learning all the symbology (and there is ALOT) you can start focusing on your builds and combinations. Creating engines have never been so fun. And guess what? It's also a great 2-player game!

Fun card game for 2-6 players. Limited roles and actions each turn (a la Puerto Rico or Citadels) add strategy. Card-drawing adds some randomness but the game still has a medium/medium-light amount of strategy. Lots of possibilities and ways to win. Experienced players can crank through games very fast, adding to this game's value.

Each play is more enjoyable than the last.  I find myself thinking about this game all the time - wishing I had a regular opponent . . .

[Downgraded from 9 to 8.  Not having a regular opponent means I'm now behind the curve, and have real trouble competing with experienced players.]

[Might have to upgrade my rating again.  Payed a couple more games against experienced opponents, and was reminded why I liked the game in the first place.  Although I still feel like I'm winging it, my scores are respectable, and I'm enjoying trying to figure out an engine . . .]

[Nope, down to a 7.  I like the game, but as more and more cards keep getting added, I just feel I'd rather play something else . . .]

RATING: 9
Multiple strategies, complex combos, eurogame-style interaction (try to benefit from the other player's decisions more than they benefit from yours), and a wide variety of cards makes for a fun game that's different every time.

Some say the game is mostly luck, but in my experience, that's just wrong. While luck is a factor, mitigating it is the true strategy.

This is a terrible game to use for introducing non-gamers to gaming. The complexity is too high and the strategies too obtuse. I've seen multiple would-be gamers turned off from gaming because of this game (they don't understand what's going on, everything feels random, and they lose horribly while not having fun). Please, please don't use this game to introduce non-gamers to gaming.

I most enjoy this game with 2 players, and find it less fun with 3. 4 players is better than 3, but 5 is too many.

La dinámica del juego es interesante, muy parecida a la de San Juan aunque más compleja. 
Cada jugador dispone de un set de cartas en el que tiene 5 posibles roles y cada turno debe seleccionar secretamente uno. Todos los jugadores juegan la acción básica de todos los roles seleccionados y adicionalmente, los jugadores que seleccionaron cada rol, realizan una acción adicional por haberlo seleccionado.
Se utiliza una única baraja de la que todos roban y el objetivo es el de construir, con las cartas robadas, que representan mundos y avances tecnológicos, un imperio galáctico próspero. 
Cuesta un poco acostumbrarse a la nomenclatura que utilizan las cartas, ya que no se utilizan textos para describir lo que hacen sino símbolos, pero una vez aprendidos, agilizan creo yo, el juego.
La estrategia es muy importante ya que hay que determinar de qué manera se construirá el imperio (a partir de mundos militares o no militares o de avances tecnológicos) en base a lo que uno va robando.
Muy recomendable.

If it weren't for the obscene amount of randomization, Race for the Galaxy would feel a lot like Puerto Rico in space. Coincidentally, everything there is to dislike about RftG stems from that randomness. It's still a fun time, but it seems wholly unnecessary when there are better economic games around. 

Rejected.

RATING: 6
It has a lot of theoretical disadvantages, according to my taste: card driven, with luck, very little interaction between players. But it is very fun to play and addictive :). Its short playing time makes very common to play a lot of games in a row (and wanting more and more). So I like to play it. 

UPDATE November 2008
Rating moved from 8 to 7. It lost its appeal after a while and my wish to play it further decreased after the appearance of Dominion.

UPDATE April 2013
Rating moved from 7 to 6. My interest for card based games is lower at the moment.

FANTASTIC game...with art to match.  If you've played San Juan and thought it was a bit too light, or perhaps just wasn't inspired by the theme, RftG might be for you.  Excellent variety in the card types and some cool decisions to make insofar as what you need to happen and what you think other players might do for you.  An easy thumbs up from me.

--update--
After nearly 20 games in a few weeks this is an easy 10.  Lots to love.  Sure, there is a fair dose of luck, but if you get completely hosed by your draw you only have to wait 20 minutes for vengeance!  Can't wait for the expansions!

RATING: 8.5
This is a near perfect 2 player game that can be played in 30 minutes.

After you get over the initial iconography learning curve you start to quickly see all different kinds of combinations you can form in your tableau. There is never an obvious winning strategy since you are at the mercy of the card draw and often have to make the best of what you have. But that's really what the game is about.

Having to decide what cards to discard in order to build the one you really want is a difficult but rewarding experience.

Knowing what phase your opponent is going to use and playing off of that is really where the interaction comes in this game. Staying inside the head of your opponent helps RFTG avoid the multiplayer solitaire that can happen in similar games.

I can't think of many other games that pack this much of a punch in such a short amount of time. 

My only negative points for this game are for how hard it is to teach a new player and for the artwork which is not really my style.

Played once so far and it was a LOT to take in on the first play but, I can see that the iconography is very descriptive and after another play through I'm sure I'll understand it and be ready to go.  I can see why this is rated so high as there is a LOT of diversity but it is not a deck builder but a get up and go card game.  Very well put together.

Steep learning curve but it is quite a fun and clever game once you get the rules down and every single symbol memorized.  Lots of viable moves per turn, you'll be faced with tough decisions to make quite frequently.

Update:
That learning curve is what prohibits me from re-acquiring this game.  It is fun, but man, it takes some effort.

Also, I don't like that each expansion brought up some "forced" new mechanic that divided the fan base.  The expansions never gave you just more cards, but rather tried to shoehorn some new, hard-to-ignore mechanism.

Nice game, as has been said elsewhere the iconography is a lot to take in, but after a play it seems to make sense.

I like the tableau building and the constraint of 12 cards built in front of you makes you consider each of the cards when choose to play them.

In the end though, it's a more complicated version of San Juan, and that can be either a good thing or a bad thing.

Aptly named -- it really is a race.

RATING: 7
Two years ago: "So yeah, Puerto Rico in space with a TCG element.  If PR didn't beat RftG by a good number of years (and if TI3 didn't do it better, even IF clunkier) I'd probably be a little more forgiving.  But this game is pretty deadly.  Its saving grace is its speed: It's over almost before it begins.  I truly don't see the hype here."

Now: I'm more forgiving.  I see the hype here.  It's speed Puerto Rico.  It's as cock-blocky and passive-aggressive (or, including certain expansions, active-aggressive) as you decide to play it out.  The learning curve is still a little vicious, and it CAN be multi-player solitaire until you pass it, but once you cross over to the point where you see how your actions can affect others, it starts getting... interesting. 

It's still no BSG, but at 20-30 minutes it's not trying to be.

The base set is fine for the casual player.  Really.  And card sleeves are probably a good idea.  And Keldon's AI is a must-have: Play several games solo to get a feel for how the cards interact, and you'll have 50x the fun when you play face-to-face.  Hell, I'll give Keldon's program an 8.5 for solo play; it will kick your ass five ways to Sunday until you get better.

My favorite thing about Race for the Galaxy is the enormous variety. On this count and among the games I've played, it's surpassed only by Dominion. With expansions, Race for the Galaxy includes several hundred cards, and in any given game you add just a dozen or so to your tableau. The space for exploration of strategies is huge.

And the possible strategies truly are different. You might settle many cheap worlds and crank out points via a produce-consume cycle; create a towering military and explore heavily to score a few select powerhouse worlds; or build a self-sustaining infrastructure of developments that reward further developing. Better still, while most cards are carefully designed to support certain strategies – blue worlds support production and consumption, while military worlds do not – a few cards break these rules, making room for crazy hybrid strategies. One starting world lets you settle most military worlds as if they were civilian worlds, for example, an ability which twists the usual space of possibilities.

The game's drag-free engine building also makes for a spectacular arc of development. You begin with a lone world and a few cards. You end with a dozen worlds with looping powers; a purring engine, a perpetual motion machine that spits out points. 

Despite this generosity, the decisions are points of high tension. For cards are the primary currency of the game, so to add a card to your tableau you may need to discard 5 others.

All the while, you must pay close attention to your opponent. Though you cannot directly hamper her plans, you must choose your role based on its relative value lest you benefit your opponent more than yourself.

Somehow, this entire experience is distilled into 20 minutes. (It must have something to do with the brilliant mechanisms for simultaneous play.) 

I know of no other game that packs so much variety and complex decision-making into so short a time.

This is an enjoyable role selection game that plays very quickly and is easy to learn. 

Many people have said Roll for the Galaxy is easier to learn than this, but I find Race much easier and cleaner. Roll has far clunkier rules in my opinion.

For the cost, the speed of gameplay, and tightness/strategic depth, I think Race is definitely superior to Roll for 2P (I have not played either with more than 2P). The only thing I like better about Roll is the custom dice are pretty sweet.

Smooth - very smooth CCG game.  It feels really tight - as if every possible combo has been analyzed and tested.

The icons did not phase me that much - they seem to make sense, but I specialize somewhat in pattern recognition.

Another tactical game - I have been unable to establish any long-term strategies - just go with the flow.

I really look forward to trying this with a real opponent.

After introducing this to a friend:
It was painfully apparent that experience with the game makes a difference.  I was able to easily defeat a novice even though I was not trying, unlike San Juan, where I lost the introduction game I played.  I prefer games that reward intelligent play a wee bit more than luck.  So far, it appears this will be the case with RftG.

After playing with real opponents for several games, it confirms what I have already written.  Outstanding middle weight card game.

Why this is not a 10:
-> Being a middle weight game reduces my prospects for playing.
-> I would like some variety in my gaming.

Incredibly deep combo-building engine game. This game has the highest depth-to-playtime ratio of any game I know of (barring timed abstracts), and is infinitely replayable with a plethora of strategies.

It strikes a perfect balance between strategy and tactics; one cannot predetermine a strategy beforehand, but must adapt to the cards dealt. On the other hand, while changing strategies mid-stream is possible, it is seldom worthwhile. There are a multitude of strategies to use and they are generally very balanced.

I personally have never had any trouble with the icons.

After subsequent plays, this game is losing interest to me. It has much of the feel of playing Magic. If you pull a good combo of cards, you have a great chance of winning, but a poor hand of cards can set you back. Once you learn what the cards are and what combinations work best, it's just a matter of playing them in the right order. That doesn't mean you're going to win, just that eventually it will just come down to card draws.

After more plays, I think I'm getting into the Explore +5 action more. Once you know what card(s) you're looking for, there is some strategy to pulling more. It's really about playing what you have and playing your cards into each other.

RATING: 9
Race for the Galaxy shares lots of mechanism with San Juan. It actually seems to have even less interaction with players than it. You do have to be aware what others are most likely to do so you can benefit from it but beyond that you have very little interaction. There is a good layout and symbols on the cards. So you can see easily (once you learn the symbols) what you can do in each phase of the game. Once you have more games under your belt you'll probably start to remember better what bonuses you get in each phase but I had sometimes hard time to remember those.

It is definitely a very good game but it takes the first game to learn the mechanics and it helps when you have idea what type of cards there are in the deck. I won't think it will be a too big hit with non-gamers as it has a quite steep learning curve. RftG is simply a great game with a lot of replayability and as a bonus game is over in a short time with experienced players.

Update: It's a bit different with two players advanced rules as you can do double-developing or -settling and you're able to play consume/produce-cycle all by yourself. Not sure if this breaks anything in the game but it plays a bit differently being still an excellent game. Two-player game works well with the basic rules too.

The good point over San Juan: choosing the role at the same time avoids analysis and gives dynamism to the game. For now, I just played 2 games on prototype and the initial complexity and variety of the cards has been harder to overcome. The rating may rise with more games... Have to see if I prefer variety (and complexity) of this one above San Juan easier path and the final art...[EDIT] After more than 200 games, the answer is simply yes :)

RATING: 10
Whoa. This game is incredible. And deep. But still really quick.

The theme has been built very carefully, and the mechanics fit the theme perfectly. The components aren't bad either: The cards are very sturdy, and the artwork is nice, and serious thought has been given to usability issues. Thanks to the graphic design, layout and the icon system, gameplay is really smooth and it is very easy to keep track of your special powers.

Lots of possibilies for ultimate killer combos, and for me the game feels more like a hand management game than a snowball engine optimization scheme. There is also quite the right amount of outguessing, which usually ends in me choosing the wrong phase anyway ;P

Success depends mostly on how good you are, but since the game only lasts about half an hour, and (unlike in most snowball engine games) gameplay and artwork don't suck astronomically at first sight, it is reasonably easy and fast to reach a comfortable skill level. 

Raised the rating from 9 to 10 after 10 playings. 

And just when you think you know the game, they'll give you the expansions...

The iconography makes it; it's very simple to quickly judge the value and functionality of all the cards in play and in your hand, and the phase selection system is extremely well integrated both visually and mechanically.

Space themed card game with asymmetrical factions and some tidy mechanisms. There are lots of symbols to learn and card combinations that make it good for repeated play in a static group, but terrible if you're introducing new players. This is a great game for a group, who are going to play the hell of it and become competitive enough to enjoy the intricacies. As a casual player I had some fun, but felt that without any meaningful way to affect the other players it became a dull efficiency game with set plays and luck of the draw dependency, which is a shame as this would be a great alternative to the glitzy CCGs, but without the expense.

RATING: 8
I enjoy playing this game.  It's fast enough after a few plays that the luck factor doesn't bother me much.  It does seem like the game rewards players who manage to draw all the parts of their "combo", however, and player interaction gets less important later in the game when everyone has their plans in place.  UPDATE: Downgraded from 9 to 8.  The card combos are just too strong, and there are those occasional games I won (or lost) where I never had to pay much attention to what my opponents were doing.

RATING: 7
Trying to delevop a card game with the richness of Puerto Rico and adding something of its own is definitely no mean task. Race for the Galaxy was meant to be a more complex game than San Juan, attempting to keep the principle of the different phases of a game with a little advantage to the player who chose to play them. At the same time, it does not restrict the choice of a phase to one single player, and the huge amount of action cards that can be deployed within these phases means that  a vast range of possibilities lie open for each match. Last but not least, the game offers a clever, Bob Abbott-like payment system: to play out one card a player needs to pay an amount of other cards in his hand.

Unfortunately, Race for the Galaxy isn't as brilliant as Puerto Rico by a long stretch. There are several reasons for this: the icons system is economic but difficult to get used to, there's absolutely no interaction nor anything like a common pool for the players to choose from (actions, cards... whatever), there's quite some luck as well since a draw does not always include cards that support whatever a player has already on use, and even after many, maaaaany plays (until players learn how to optimize their hands) neither good cards nor good tactics can win a game on their own.

RATING: 5.4
Decisamente poco immediato e, anche se fondamentalmente semplice, risulta ostico specie nelle prime partite. Molti simboli sulle carte, non sempre immediati, e una volta compresi bisogna  imparare a sfruttarli a proprio favore e infine conoscere le combo (molte) più produttive. Un gioco da provare diverse volte prima di poter padroneggiare. La meccanica è simile a quella di Puerto Rico con scelta dell'azione, con piccolo vantaggio, alla quale però tutti possono partecipare. Simpatico anche in 2, rende però al meglio in 4.

RATING: 6
I never got bowled over by Race for the Galaxy. There was some appeal to the game, but I never rated it to the ridiculously high levels of the community as a whole, and I can't see myself playing the 50-odd games a year that devotees seem to clock up. C'mon - it's a simple card-laying game propped up by a geeky theme and some top-notch card art, but nothing more. Among other problems, the card turnover can be too swift and the VP awards don't seem to balance terribly well.

I just played my first game... scored 2nd place with 51 pts... i dont think that matters.. just felt like writing it...


6 of us played last night [the game only supports 5], each person had a hand, and i shared a hand with another person who never played before.... this is the first time where i've ever shared a player spot with someone, and I enjoyed it WAY more that i would have imagined...  the other guy on my "team" had never played either... so it wasn't like we were just watching the other play...


did i like this game?.... yes


was i good at it?... i'm good at everything... i mean yes


was it entertaining? kind of... i had fun building my hand.. and i did see the benefit of predicting other players moves... but there was such a lack of player interaction, that i felt that was the biggest miss of this game... FORTUNATELY... i was paired up with someone.... sure, it made it a bit like a co-op (which i typical dislike).... but if anything, it added to the enjoyment of this first "learning game".... now if i play again... i want my own hand... and to be completely isolated from the rest of the world... 


Recomended.. to gaming introverts (who like hand mangement card games)


I'll play again... but i'm not seeking it out

Steep learning curve, but once you learn the rules it is a very fast and fun game with lots of complexity and strategy.  

Expansions add more depth and balance (as well as a few more strategies), but at the cost of the speed and ease of play that first pulled me in.

After further thought, the base game is really compromised by the limited viable winning strategies.  While I still like it, the expansions are necessary to add balance but detract from some of the aspects I like about the base game (easy setup, quick play).

Excellent game with great replayability as it takes a while to learn all the strategies and cards. It is a little tough to learn the game, but if you commit 5-10 plays to get it down it will easily last you 50-100 plays before you even start to get tired of it. Quick and complex, a rare combination that really makes it a winner for me.

Even though the game is simple, it is always difficult to explain to new players! Symbols make the work complicated.

Wow. this game rocks. the different strategies that come up on the initial draw are very different, and figuring out what to do with it is what is so cool about the game...you need to adjust early until you have a set game plan but the beginning is the hardest. then hoping that your cards come up is agonizing. It deserves the rankings it gets and expansions are just that, expanding upon a great game.

Bear in mind I've only played this once and it could well get better after more plays.

For a newbie, the amount of different symbols used on the cards can be mind boggling.  I spent half the game not really having a clue what I was doing.

A lot of games get accused of being multi-player solitaire, most of the time unfairly in my opinion.  This game, however, really did feel like multi-player solitaire.  I didn't really have any idea what the other players were doing and it didn't really seem to matter.

By and large I'm not a big fan of card games anyway.  This one could well get better after you get used to all the symbols and become familiar with the cards, but to be honest I'm in no hurry to get to know the game better.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]- Role selection and trying to leech off your opponents role(s)
- Cards have multiple uses during the game
- Excellent 2p with the advanced rules
- 20 minute play time packed with strategy
- Seemingly endless replay value

This is my favorite 2p game to play with my son. We will be playing this for years to come, what an amazing game. We have since added RFtG: Alien Artifacts, RFtG: The Gathering Storm and RFtG: Rebel vs Imperium expansions to our collection.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (9):[/COLOR]

[i]I bought this game after quite a few BGG'ers recommended it to me in various threads. I was looking for a good 2p game to play with my son. After our first 3 or 4 plays I was not impressed, I actually regretted my decision to buy the game. However; since I have a limited gaming budget I was stuck with it. So my son and I continued to play, we instituted the advanced 2p rules and we started to get familiar with the cards. These 2 factors ended up completely changing my view on this game. 

My son and I had very little trouble figuring out the icons, I find that whole argument to be a little overblown. It may hold water if you are teaching this to a non gamer, but this isn't a game I would pull out in that circumstance.[/i]

[b]Race for the Galaxy[/b] is a card game using the multiple role selection mechanic.  It is [i]very[/i] similar to the [b]San Juan[/b] card game, except now every player can choose the same role and receive the same bonus for choosing that role.  A game usually takes about 30 minutes to play, but can vary, especially with new players.

The cards are well designed and you can tell that they put a lot of thought into the layout.  There is very little text on the cards, and instead the game uses iconography to depict the function of the cards.  Icons are used almost to excess, and you will find that you have to frequently refer to the player's aids, with all the definitions of the many different icons used, for several games at first.

I think the game is good and well designed, but I feel that somehow the game isn't done, and that there should be a little more of everything.  It really seems that the game was designed as incomplete, and I suspect that one must purchase the expansions to complete the game.

I haven't played any of the expansions and I'm not sure if I will ever buy them.  It is a good game, but I don't like to [i]have[/i] to purchase the expansions just to get a complete game.

This is definately one of my favorite games.  It has excellent mechanics, artwork, and a alot of decision making.  The role selection provides for some really nice player interaction, and you definately will benefit from guessing what phases your opponents will play.  But overall this is a game where you can't target your opponents in the same way as a game like Glory to Rome or Citadels.  There is some luck in that there is card draw, but it is a game where I have noticed that generally the better players win.  A potential negative is that the game has a relatively high learning curve, and it often takes players a few games to really "get it."

I put off reading the rules for R4tG because I was intimidated by all the reviews that described the game's steep learning curve.  Imagine my relief when I discovered this was not true!  I'm not particularly quick to learn new games, but this one was a relative cinch based on my experience with 7 Wonders.  Granted, there are a great many cards in play during the game, so multiple plays will lead to an increased appreciation of one's options, but I found my very first game to be fun and challenging, leaving me eager to play again soon.  The quality of the cards and the artwork on them adds to the experience, and I feel the many complaints I've read about the cards' iconography to be unfounded.  Yes, it's complex, but there's no way this could be avoided, given the complexity of the game.  Familiarity comes with play, and the icons rapidly begin to make sense. This game may not appeal to those who want the ability to directly sabotage their opponents, but I personally appreciate having no one to blame but myself (and the luck of the draw) if I fail to maximize my opportunities.  Exciting and intense with very little down time, R4tG is a fun and intellectually nutritious game that requires constant planning, the revision of plans, and the weighing of options.    (5+5)

I'm still deciding if this game is all its cracked up to be! The cards are really awesome in design! I think I like Starship Catan a bit more though! Not that RftG is similar, in fact it is instead similar to San Juan and it is an even better game! I would say there definitely is more options for strategy and therefore more replay ability! There are a lot of symbols in this game you will have to decipher! Not fond of the sketchy rules! A few specific examples would help in regards to the Trade:Consume phase! 

Now after playing several solo games with the Gathering Storm expansion I am getting more play time and enjoyment from the game.

I've played with Keldon's AI and friends (mostly with AI) for more than 100 times, and still feel there are much room for me to improve my skill or to get a better understanding of the game. To name a few things that I'm still observing:
1. Each card's pro & con.
2. Each card's pro & con in different combination
3. Each card's usefulness in different playing style. (Rush, $ minded, produce consume, development, military)
It's hard to believe how deep this game is...

On a side-note, the game feels perfectly balanced after throwing in "The Gather Storm" expansion. However when "Rebel vs Imperium" expansion is also thrown in, it completely PIMPED the game into a wacky ride! Less strategic, more chaotic, more luck, but also more FUN!

2009/11/30:
I'm bumping this game up to a 10. 
Well deserved.

----------
Thanks to the released RFTG AI, I finally got a chance to play repetitively to see if I'd like this game. After playing several times, I immediately went out a buy a copy. (Smart marketing strategy RIO.)

I liked it better than I thought I'd be! RFTG is a elegant and sophisticated piece of work. Not nearly as fun, interactive and creative as Glory to Rome. However RFTG feels more like a intellectually competitive game; certainly a good, if not extremely good alternative to GTR. (I think Glory To Rome will be my all time favorite, period.)

I like RFTG for its short play time, planning & calculating oriented nature, multiple paths to winning, and believe it or not, its SUBTLE Interaction. However there's a tendency to win more with Produce/Consume strategy and a mild Run-away leader problem. Once the Consume engine is built-up, it's hard to stop it. 

Well... my strategy idea may change in the future as I sink more plays into it.

NOTE: Because of this game, I'm dropping Puerto Rico's rating lower. I just can't imagine myself going back to play Puerto Rico anymore.

I didn't enjoy my first ten games of Race because it has a steep learning curve, and only grudgingly played it when others wanted to. I stuck at it because I knew it was a good game based on its high rank, now it's one of my favourite short games. 

The icon system is annoying and makes learning the game difficult - I don't care about being able to see art work - I'd much rather a card was covered in a paragraph of text that described exactly how it works, whilst also retaining the icons for experienced players.

In terms of gameplay, it's closest to Puerto Rico (buts shorter and with more luck), like a more complex version of San Juan and only some vague similarities with Glory to Rome. I think PR is the better game because it doesn't have the flukey good/bad draws. 

The main differences from PR are the simultaneous action selection, hand management, the military mechanic, 2 types of buildings (Devs and Worlds), and both Trader and Captain are integrated into the Consume phase. 

Play against the AI here:
http://www.keldon.net/rftg/

It's really good for learning the game because it enforces the rules for you. I think the best way to learn is 2 player advanced, as you have more control and can thus see the effects of what you are doing. Games take me about 4 minutes each.
This helps you learn the icons and deck composition and gain experience. The AI is strong.

There might be a good game in here, as so many people keep telling me. But realising that's a mid-green planet with a hazy blue outline, so you need to try to conquer it with 3 military while drinking a cappucino and watching Scrubs repeats seems to be the theme every time I have a go. A reprint with clear symbols would be a start, meanwhile I do have other games.

One of the first games Paulo showed me and I remember being overwhelmed with all of the iconography and specifics of the cards, which I think is the point. You're supposed to choose one awesome point-generating card and build your empire around that. I love role selection but there are too many options and decisions to make from turn to turn. I would simplify the shit out of this game and just stick to the base game.

I really don't understand all the complaints about the symbols. It wasn't that difficult, maybe took a game or two, to learn them, and after that they are intuitive. At least the ones in base game and first expansion.

Good game, overall. So far it feels like scores are very heavily linked to cards drawn, although I could see how more plays might allow to get better scores with worse cards as well. But still, luck of the draw naturally has very heavy influence here.

Bought used in great condition.

I love this game.  Great theme change and adaptation of puerto rico.  I have yet to play with anyone who grasped the strategy well enough to make good decisions.  As a result I know I have not seen the complete depth of the game.  Getting pounded by a few expert players would give me a better gauge of the game, and I am sure it will push this game up .5 to 1.5 points.

Edit: This game is just way too good.  I am moving up to a 9 for now, but this game has no ceiling.

Edit: Has to be a ten.  I have played this hundreds of times, and I will never turn it down.  If I ever rearrange my top ten, this has serious consideration for the 1 spot.

RATING: 10
I think this is the only 10 in my collection.

Yes yes, it's a steep learning curve. Yes yes, there are a *million* little icons. Give me icons over lengthy card texts any time, please. 

I must have played more than 1000 hands of this in the past four years, half in person and half via Keldon's AI (and the other online play environments before that). It never gets old, ever. Play time is perfect, the depth of decisionmaking is perfect...it's perfect in every way for me. 

However, it requires some time to master. This to me is a positive, not a negative. It means it'll give you something to chew on for months and years. It's not "solveable." Mastery means experimenting with every strategy, memorizing the deck (much easier w/o expansions), really investing in getting your head wrapped around the game.

I'm not persuaded that adding the expansions made the core game any better, although playing it with ALL the options turned on (goals, takeovers, prestige) is one hell of a tough game. 

Cannot say enough good things about this game.

RATING: 6
"I don't mind the icons, but the whole game just feels like a slightly-bloated San Juan. I prefer role drafting of SJ over the simultaneous reveal of Race. The base game of Race feels a bit incomplete (while also feeling needlessly complicated)."

What I like:
- Pay cards to play cards is cool
- Theme is nice
- Pretty quick, with experienced players
- Military option for settling

What I don't like:
- Simultaneous role selection
- Trade/Consume split
- Complicated special abilities of cards
- Base game feels like it is missing some cards

My Rating started as a 7, but the more I played, the lower my rating went, down to a 4. After not playing for a couple years, it's back up to a 6, which is where it is likely to stay. 

The BGG-voted weight of 3.0 seems about right.

Fantastic game! Challenging, and not at all as difficult as it seems at first. You just need to get used to the iconography. Illustrations aren't the best but are thematic, the quality of the cards is great. It's obviously inspired in San Juan, but it does a good job pushing the idea further, making it more involving and better integrating the "settlement" theme! Very good game indeed sir!

Dreaded learning this game. Sat on my shelf for 3 months before I got the courage to plow through the minefield of icons. Took 2 hours to get through first game, but surprise: we both liked it. I'm glad I held off on my initial reaction of 'trade this asap!' after I first saw the rulebook and the 299 icons on each card. I look forward to game 2 when we can cut it down to an hour. And bonus for my wife: she won the first game, so you know that's going to make her happy to play again.

Update: This game is solitaire, and does not work unless you play with someone at exactly the same level. For this mechanic, I much prefer 'glory to rome' and have not gone back to Race after the initial 2 plays. Highly overrated.  

Update: game is superb when played on keldon. Game is much better on pc than playing the card version. Also, easy to get games in, which is very hard to do in real life, as this game appeals only to a very small subset of hardcore gamers. You learn quickly from your mistakes on keldon, but it still takes many games to get familiar with all icons, amd many more games to actually win. Playing against live opponents requires all players be equal in play skill, which seldom happens. Game is much too complicated to teach to casual gamers.  For sale.

Better than San Juan but more complicated to play. But is no broken as San juan (at San juan first and second player has a huge adventage to third and 4th). The main problem of this game is the hard interface of cards at the first games. Also the price for a card game. Also is difficult to control what other players are doing. But is good and have very nice pictures on cards [28-07-2008]

This is the game that I wish I could play more often. It takes Puerto Rico and puts it into a faster format suitable for two players, which is pretty notable. I love that the game truly is a race in that you often don't have time to develop the engine that you'd like to create as you blend luck and skill, mostly skill, into reacting and expanding as you throttle toward filling your tableau or depleting the VP chips.

Excellent game. So many things you want to do, a great variety of cards that interlock in interesting ways, with value changing depending on which other cards you have and (to a lesser extent) on what other players are doing.

How games play out varies depending on the strategies chosen by each player, and it works nicely from 2 to 4 players.

I have now played this enough to figure out what I want to say about it.  I want to like this game, but so far, I do not because I don't seem to be very good at it.  I find it difficult to figure out how to maximize my point potential, and I find myself tending to go for the easy things rather than those things that will give me a way to build up victory points.  I have finally understood the "Consume" action, which was the most puzzling part of this.

I find that games of RftG are a very rewarding experience, full of strategy, interesting decision making and tension. Not only do you need to pick a strategy based upon your home world and the cards available to you, but you need to watch what the other players are doing in order to try and counter their plans.

Given that it is a card game, there is an element of luck to it, but the games are quick so you can play many games in one sitting, which evens out the luck factor somewhat. Moreover, the luck of the draw can be minimised a little by selecting appropriate actions, but it is certainly somewhat responsible for providing some of the aforementioned tension that is present in the game.

I played about three or four rounds of this game in a weekend and just couldn't get the hang of it. I liked the game, but something just didn't click with me.

Perhaps it was overall gaming experience learned from other games in the meantime, but the second time around I had a much better handle on the game. I like the wealth of strategy options, and I am much more comfortable about ditching cards to get the ones I want/need now.

Late adopter, I tried to like it. Many friends certainly do. Doesn't feel like San Juan to me, although knowing that one well helps.

Definate randomness here. In a 3p game, one person cruised to the end (12) in the time the next (who was experienced) player had got to 6 cards. Thats not strategy people, thats luck. I can see how this won't happen often, but it will happen.

I thought the expansion might get me up the learning curve by playing solo a bit. It didn't.

I loved this game at the start. It took a long while to get used to, but after 150 games (including online and Vs Bot) I still can't figure out a strategy that works, and whether I win or not bears very little relation to what I do! Perhaps I need to get back to playing Vs humans again, but I think that the strategies are so varied, you can't wait on the card you want and getting the best from your hand is a mammoth task.

So I started playing against humans again and have downgraded my score. I am getting frustrated. I have tried all the different techniques I can think of and still can't guarantee a win. Ultimately the variety in the cards and the complexity of the game does little to aid play and it is starting to feel like an extremely well debugged 'bad idea'. Sometimes when we meet I can tell by the second round that my hand is too lousy and I'm never going to win and I just have to play on with that knowledge. I like that luck is a part, but you should be able to start with any hand and have a shot at winning.

I love the flavour and the theme but apart from all that this game just sucks.

My vote (7) may very much likely rise as it did with Blue Moon. Somehow it seems to me on the same complex-level!

This game has a lot of potential, but it is not very new user friendly, since it helps to know the cards and possible combinations ahead of time. It has a nice "San Juan" like mechanic of choosing roles each turn and cards that create so many possibilities. After several plays, it gets addictive but you need to play with others of the same level and play often. Those who do will surely love it, just not for me.

One of my favourite games. The iconography is a marvel of modern gaming design, with only a handful of different icons Mr Lehman has managed to fit a lot of information on each card, but keep them easy to read when they sit in your hand or in your tableau.

It is a very tactical game that forces you to change strategy depending on the cards you draw and I really like this aspect of the game; you can’t just choose a strategy and run with it unless you are really lucky with the cards you draw.

I bought the first expansion after playing the base game around 10 times and I see no reason to not play with it. Picking it up with the base game would be my major recommendation if you’re going to buy this.

RATING: 9
I don't understand all the complaining about the iconography.  After about three games, the symbols make perfect sense and make the game play much smoother than loads of text would have.  I do, however, understand the complaints about multi-player solitaire.  In a 2 player game, it is far too common for a player to quickly build an efficient engine and just crank it for the rest of the game.  Even the most ardent Race fans have to admit that picking Consume X2 and produce four rounds in a row is not a thrilling, epic adventure.  When you are able to set that up, you barely care that there is another human at the table.  In the three player game, there is more subtle interaction because you must attempt to predict what actions your opponents are going to pick so that you can leach off their choices and hopefully pick a phase that will not help them much.  Even with all that said, there is little to no interaction among the players' tableaus.  There are a couple of cards that allow you to draw a card or two if you produce more _____ goods than your opponents, but that is about the extent of card interactions.  That said, if you never learn to anticipate what others will do, your skill level will be capped fairly quickly.  There is definitely skill in choosing phases that will push your agenda without aiding, and perhaps even slowing, others.  And even though I have made some negative comments, Race is still a game I will play anytime and even suggest.


Note:  Some of my complaints are fixed when an expansion is added.  It seems that more options are added to slow down/interfere with players going on autopilot consume X2/produce.

I am not sure why this game doesn't work for me, but whatever the reason, this isn't a game I ask to play.  Some things that I don't like: using cards from my hand to "pay" for playing other cards; cards that count as "goods" and stay face down until you turn them in for points or other cards; the highly confusing Consume action which has two parts (this has never been clear to me).  I do like the flexibility to play this with two players or with more.  I like the option of a basic starting hand or a random draw.  The rules are pretty simple.

Like Netrunner, completely impenetrable card game for newbies, mainly because of the extensive use of iconography. Even if you're played a few games you'll need to reference the rulebook from time to time.

Super fun and quick with 4 though, if someone can teach it. Quite like it. I find that Roll For The Galaxy has completely superseded it for me.

While I am not usually a fan of "solitaire" games, this is a glaring exception. I love how the abilities you choose need to be picked with your opponent in mind. Building an engine and seeing who can do it quicker and more efficiently is really fun--it really reminds me of playing burn vs burn in MTG

The games with 4 players were not great, but they were learning games. The game with the regular rules with 2 players was okay. The game with the advanced 2 player rules was much better! Much more strategy, yet the game is still faster because you get more actions per turn!

Man this still pales next to Roll for the Galaxy for me. I hear that it really starts to shine at 10+ plays, so I am going to do my darndest to get there. Race appeals to me because it is so short yet so meaty with quick setup and takedown. Roll isn't bad with length and setup, but it is worse in that regard enough that it inhibits it from coming out every night.

An extraordinarily solid, quick, tight game.  The standard game is good, and the advanced 2p game is one of the most brain-burning experiences I've had.  A friend refers to it as a "7-minute ab workout," and that's quite accurate; the game doesn't last a long time, but while it's going you're making a whole lot of difficult decisions.

No arguing it's a good game with great mechanics, I've never really given the game enough time to learn the subtleties - I prefer more direct player interaction but if you have a solid group of players there's definitely a lot here to sink your teeth into. Lots of expansions, which is nice. Forced to make tough choices each turn.

Can be a pain to teach as there are a LOT of symbols that are not immediately intuitive.

Fun game (sort of), but I don't understand what all the fuss is about.  I do enjoy the action choice mechanism allowing you to out bluff your opponent(s), but that's really the only interaction and once you realize you're playing solitaire it kind of gets a little boring.

I really liked all the things you're able to do in this game, it really felt like I was building up an empire.  It seems like the key to the game is taking advantage of other people's actions, so you have to be ready to play a development or a planet in case someone else chooses that action.  There are definitely multiple paths to victory, each of which feels distinct and varied to me.

RATING: 7
Despite having a very similar style of gameplay to San Juan (cards used both as money and buldings, some cards produce goods, others give you bonuses or points) I've found this game a lot more enjoyable and replayable. Part of that is the theme, but I think the main factor is the way different sets of cards work together to give an array of viable strategies. Each time we thought one approach was game-breakably good, someone went and found another one that could beat it. Plays fairly quickly, too, which is a bonus.
Main drawback is a lack of direct interaction between players...maybe this comes in in some of the expansions?

RATING: 9
As hard to learn as everyone says. Once grasped, a thing of genius to behold. Early in your career, it will take 90% of your cognitive capacity just to execute each of your turns. Learning to play competitively, as in reading other players' tableaux and considering what they are likely to do in an effort to "win the Race," only requires the other 90% of your cognitive capacity.
Strikes me as a game that will appeal to folks who like games requiring heavy concentration, which is to say that the space theme doesn't seem terribly important. Sometimes you decide to build something other than what you need most just because "we come such a long way," which is another way of saying the games ends very quickly. And the artwork is wonderful.

Hands down, the best card game I've ever played. It's absolutely brilliant and I seriously would never turn down a game. Fast playing, incredibly deep and the combos you can pull off are great. Even after 100+ plays, I still am not that great at the game. The icons for this game are brilliant. Now to new players, it's a bit rough, but after a game or two, they are well onto their way.

I just have 2 issues with this game and it's not really the games fault. My first issue is that the game is short...a bit too short. It falls into this weird category of not quite filler and not quite long enough to be the main meal of the night. I could play it over and over, but people are usually done with it after 1 or 2 plays. The second issue I have with it is that it's rather difficult to get a new player into it and experienced players can crush a new player.

UPDATE: Traded at Alphaspel. Nah, I might be a fine game with more plays. But as all games have this premise, I feel no need to struggle with this. Better to play games that feels more "right" from the start.

*** 

It's like San Juan but a lot more complex. Fine, I have always lacked some depth in SJ. It's got nicer artwork than SJ and the paths to victory are several.

Great, so I bought it.

When reading the booklet I discovered the rules were very detailed. Hm, not overly complex maybe I thought, but there was a lot to learn. Well, yes, the rules where actually kind of hard to digest I discovered by the second reading. Am I stupid, it has a weight under 3 on the geek? Is it just the amount of all small details? These icons and small symbols?

Fine... But surley this was a good buy after all?

Well, not really. At least not for me. Initially the game where sadly not that fun to play, although I saw some potential. The sum of RftG is less than the parts and San Juan is to my surprise a much better game. 

I will try give it some more plays so the ratings will hopefully rise. I think that this is a game that needs to be played a lot before it really shines.

I enjoyed this deeper San Juan game.  There's no blocking like in SJ, you can plan out your moves, the starting cards combo well, it plays fast yet is pretty deep, and pretty interesting.

This game is the example of multiple player solitaire, which I don't like.  The iconology has a deeper learning curve at first, however easy to figure out once you're familiar.

Making more symbols and possible cards and action types may make the game more complex, but they don't necessarily make it more strategic or enjoyable. About the same decision logic as San Juan, but with a convoy of people telling me it's better behind it. Well they're right, it is better. Barely.

Very similar mechanic to San Juan, with greater complexity and maybe more depth.  My sons are more enthused about this game than me,perhaps because I rarely beat them!  Although I am happy to play when prompted, I do find that once someone has obtained the cards to facilitate a particular winning strategy (and there doesn't appear to be many variants despite the apparent complexity), the game quickly becomes a series of mechanical plays until one of the end states has been achieved.  Maybe I will find greater depth in time if I can be motivated to look hard enough.

UPDATE: after more plays I have grown fonder, increasing score from original 7 to an enthusiastic 8.  Definitely a game that grows on you.

My favorite game of all time.

It got its inspiration from Puerto Rico, but it turned it completely around and is, in my opinion, a much better game. And I like Puerto Rico a lot. 

It's Puerto Rico the card game with simultaneous role selection. It's super San Juan on steroids with a space theme. It's infinitely replayable. It's complex and challenging. It's deep. It's interactive. It's quick. It's flawless. 

It's perfect!

For some reason I can't get enough of this game. Been playing the Ai a lot lately. I love the amount of depth packed into 30-60 minutes of play (half that time vs the ai). The expansions help flesh this game out nicely so I'd recommend getting them with the game.

I'm hoping to get my wife into it now that she is familiar with a similar game, 7 wonders. The downside to this game is that it can be hard to understand at first due to all the iconography.

edit: My wife caught on just fine to Race for the Galaxy. She is finding the more she plays the more she likes it. This is currently my favorite fast game since it plays in 30min or less but has good decision making and depth.

edit: this game just doesn't get old. A real classic.

Trying to add depth with more symbols and more special actions on each card generally does not suit my gaming style. I feel 7 Wonders employs the same technique, and I don't like that game either.

There may be a theme to this game, but I spent so much time trying to read the symbols and decipher what everything meant to pay any attention to what the theme on the cards actually said or meant.

A great game can take a small set of things going on and provide a rich complexity based on how everything meshes together. There seems to be a trend in games to add depth by adding more stuff going on. This is a mistake in my opinion.

Mechanics are light, learning is heavy. I don't want to be the one having to teach this game to others and that's why I won't buy the game. With an experienced group and smooth gameplay, I like it pretty much.

This game gets better and better every time. Far better than San Juan. I little tough to learn all the icons but now we do not need the player aids at all any more. 
The strategy is very good with a lot of paths to victory. There are a lot of cards that you want to keep but still you have to "throw" away (use as gold) some of them. Angst!
Already waiting for the expansion, more players and more cards plus some new strategy to try out?

After a lot of plays, this has lost some of its luster, but is still fun with experienced players. Teaching this game is not fun, though. Unless the players are already interested in the game and understand that there's an unusually steep learning curve, it can be an exercise in frustration for all involved. Unlike in traditional board economic games, RftG has a much less transparent engine, so beginners will not see what steps they need to take to make progress unless it's spelled out explicitly. 

Update: has found its way back into the rotation - still a lot of fun. Have been exploring a few new approaches and am looking forward to the expansion. *** now that the expansion is in my hands and I've got a new regular 2P opponent, this is going back to a 9.

9 -> 10: I always enjoy playing this game. My first 10.

Note - all plays are recorded under the most recent expansion's entry.

I am a little premature on this one. Just ordered it and I am waiting for it to arrive. Have not played it yet, but I am looking for a good game for me and my wife to play by ourselves and this one has some pretty rave reviews.... Will update soon!

Update: Played with my wife for the first time last night. I think I enjoyed it more than her (although she caught on quick), but I can attribute this to the fact that I was a big magic player, and she has never really played a CCG before (which this reminds me of).

I think that it will get better for me as I play it, but I am afraid that we will be playing Agricola and 7 Wonders as they are more her style.

I still like it, my wife admitted it is an OK game and she does not like the theme. I am sad, but it looks like San Juan may be coming soon.

We went back to only RftG and tGS - but this doesn't get many plays now.

We've added RvI now, only one play, and we liked it a lot. This one seems to add more military. We didn't use the takeover rules yet. 

Played twice now with tGS. Not sure about the bonus tiles yet. Some of the new cards are nice. Played twice more, we're beginning to take the bonus tiles into consideration more. Not sure if I would add them every time. The new cards are definitely staying in the deck. They seem to add a lot of explore powers to the game (but that could just be coincidence). 

Borrowed the game, played it the same evening. Some trouble understanding and remembering all the symbols, after a few rounds that was down to 'what's that thingy?' when we saw a new variation, and by the end of the game we pretty much had all of them figured out. Should therefore play a lot quicker next time, and it did. We played it twice more with the standard rules, then went on to the 2 player rules, which I like even better (I won, so that also helps :) ). 
Bought the game by now and explained to new players for the first time (or rather my bf did). They were a bit overwhelmed by the symbols at first, but caught on quick enough...

More than any other game I've experienced, I think this one could most be accused of being "multiplayer solitaire", but only as much as an Olympic footrace is multiplayer solitaire.  It's still challenging, it's still a competition to get to the end first.  I really enjoy it.

I love the mechanic of using cards for multiple purposes.  Add that to engine building and space theme and I'm sold. It plays a little like multi-player solitaire, depending on the strategies that each player is taking.  In some games there is a very cool synergy where you can deduce what role your opponent is going to take and then decide whether you should take that role or not. In others, your strategies and the timing of those strategies don't line up at all and you are essentially playing on your own. If you could always play off each other's role selection it might be a perfect 10.

I also think the iconography is pretty intuitive. I can never remember what the different buildings do in Castles of Burgundy, but I have an easy time with these icons. It may just depend on how your brain works.

The rules and the many, many symbols on the cards made our group think this would be complicated to play, until we got through the first round.  It's actually very simple, and to my mind, it felt quite a lot like Gin, because it's a mostly non-strategic card game where you start with a random hand, look for weak synergies in your few cards, plan to implement those synergies fairly algorithmically, but defect from them opportunistically if other players offer you a better opportunity or you get a good random draw.  Interaction with other players is almost non-existent.  You occasionally guess whether another player is committed to a certain action, which gives you a partial action for free, and trying not to give them actions matters a little, but for the most part, it's a 4-player solitaire.

This is the sort of game I would like more if I played it more often. Learning the card set well seems to make the game more enjoyable and it hasn't been hitting the table often enough for that to happen. Given the choice, I would prefer to play it's cousin, San Juan. That said, it's still a good game and I'd gladly play it.

Very good game, the learning curve makes this a no go for casual play though. The expansions are necessary, but a rip-off for what you get. Solo rules? Even a mediocre PC game gives more fun than playing this rather cumbersome solo variant. The take-over rules really go against the fast-paced soul of the game with all that whacky book-keeping, and the Prestige thing seems to have too much impact and gives birth to cards with graphical and iconical overkill. The graphics on the cards seem to have been of greater important than the information because the font is barely readable, written what seems dark grey on light gray on a shaded background picture instead black on white in a window - abysmal design errors. And I have some expansions in english and some in german because the company couldn't keep that in sync for the german version. 

Now you might ask why does he still care for the game and give it a 9?

Because it is an EXCELLENT game! So excellent that you play it even despite all those stunning shortcomings mentioned above. BTW, I do not (never ever) play it with take-overs or prestige, but use all the other cards and, to some point, the tokens for additional ways to get VPs.

Puerto Rico in space, which is a high compliment. Fight through the difficult iconography and you'll find a faster game than PRico, meatier than San Juan, extensible, but with a sci-fi theme.

I have mainly played this game as a two player game (although have also played as a three player).  This is certainly becoming one of my favourite games.  At first glance there was way too much information to take in, certainly a lot of abstract symbols to learn!  After one play the symbols made a lot more sense and you could start to build your empire.  A fantastic game, but beware of analysis paralysis!!!!!!

There are multiple ways to play any given starting world. And both of those things can hedge against (or help foster) luck. One of my first designer games played and I doubt I will ever stop enjoying it.

Take Puerto Rico's mechanics (role-taking and VP-enhancing buildings), remove all the clumsiness that burdens PR (ships that only carry on type of goods, settlers, trade house limits...) and you'll have Race for the Galaxy. A fine, elegant card game, that plays quickly but has tremendous depth and a reasonably well integrated theme.  

Update: this is fast becoming one of my favourites. You really come to enjoy it when you understand the whole point of the game is to constantly adapt your strategy to the cards you are dealt with, instead of just looking for one or two specific cards.

I've played it twice and I'll play it again.  I've read a lot of complaints about the iconography but I truly don't see a problem with it.  I find it intuitive.

Hey, I think the game is good and I sought it out for a while.  Glad to have it.  Small footprint, too.  Hope the cards hold up well over time. (I've sleeved the player cards).  Enjoyable to those who are fans of themes of space, many cards, and strategy.

The reputation for steep learning curve is well-deserved, but when you start to see the synergy, WOW. Worth learning, and re-learning. Keldon's AI program for the PC is a good way to start (forces you to use correct rules) but the tangible cards are really great.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This game has moved up among my favorite games of all time. 

Many levels of strategy to enjoy, with more becoming evident with every play. The learning curve is steep, particularly without someone to guide you. But once it clicks it's a beautiful clockwork of finely meshing gears that is a pleasure to play. Any strategy will likely need audibles on the line of scrimmage as you make decisions on which cards to keep, which to lay into the tableau with the hope they will work together to produce points. When it works, it delivers a genuine feeling of accomplishment and a job well done. When it doesn't, well, you just want to play 1 more time to give it another shot. A true sign of an excellent game.

The icon system, while daunting at first, is brilliant once absorbed, allowing information to be conveyed while maintaining the integrity of the great artwork, which in turn keeps the mood of the theme present at all times. It's a glorious combination of form and function, and I'm so glad I finally jumped in and learned how to play.

This is one hell of a game.

RATING: 10
Very good "addition" to the San Juan family.  Of course, if I had played this first I might think that San Juan is a streamlined "spin-off" of Race for the Galaxy.  The variety of cards creates a greater range of possible strategies, which are fairly well explained through the use of unique symbols on each card.  The icon-style "hieroglyphics" seem to work better than a primarily text-driven system, as it enables the creation of a more varied deck of cards without using too much text to explain a slightly different mechanism.  This game really is a "race", as setting the tempo for getting something done (be it trading, consuming, military, etc...) has to be kept at a fast pace or your opponents may leave you in the dust.  There's a learning curve here that seems to be steeper than in San Juan, I am sure expansions will bring this to the forefront.  A very fun card game with some very exciting choices (leeching others' role selections is a great feature).

Has much in common with San Juan, but with various subtle improvements and a whole lot more depth & choice of strategies. Plays much quicker too, which is great as it allows multiple plays to try out different approaches. It is a little harder to learn/teach than San Juan, but well worth the effort.

VP chips are a great inclusion, both as an alternate end condition, and as a scoring aid to help avoid the need for paper & pencil (though double the quantity would have been appreciated for when playing with more players). The chips are a bit small & dark however.

The theme appeals to me much more than that of San Juan, and the potential with the 2 expansions is pretty big.

The cards & use of icons throughout are great - except perhaps the titles are a little dark & hard to read under lower lighting conditions, although the titles are not at all important to gameplay.

Race for the Galaxy is one of the bravest design I've seen. Tom Lehmann gives us only a deck of cards (I don't count points tokens since they can be replaced by anything) and promises a worthy game every time. And, oh god, it is delivered.

Of course there is chance, luck of the draw and so on, but with such an elegant design it really doesn't matter - even if you lose, you still have fun, you still accomplish things, use your imagination, make really hard choices. It's amazing.

As for interaction - for people who think that race (in sports, video games, boardgames) has lack of interaction and only disciplines like box, where people fight, or chess, where you can knock opponents pieces, involve any meaningful interaction, Race will fall flat indeed. But interaction here is much more subtle. To win you don't have to get as much points as you can, you just need to have more than your opponent. You can benefit from phases that your opponent chooses, you can speed up end of the game by building or grabbing all points. There's plenty of very gentle and brilliant interaction in Race.

And expansions coming in arcs that offer you different play styles? Even better! I never understood why a lot of people didn't like Alien Artifacts. It gives you opportunity to make Race game a longer one, you don't have to use it, it's a choice me and my girlfriend always wanted. Maybe someday we will see a coop expansions arc.

I liked this game after my first few plays. It was all about building a thematic space empire and seeing who got the right cards to win. Then I played a few dozen games against the AI, and something clicked. It really is a race: to get cards in your hand, cards on the table, and a large chunk of vp chits. There's no time to sculpt the perfect combo, R4tG is a manic and tense efficiency race to get more out of every action than your opponents. Beautiful!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I have a stronger preference for icons in designs rather than text as reading slows play and makes it difficult to assess what opponents have in their tableau e.g Puerto Rico.

But boy does RftG suffer from icon overload. This unique language is a major hurdle in translating into a smooth first gaming experience and as such I was put off. But the title, imagery and icon for "drop ships" was a magnetic hint of what is one of the most strongly thematic card games playable in an hour.

Some time later I downloaded the AI version and armed with the rules I slowly learnt the language of the iconography and phase bonuses. Since then I've been addicted not only to the running scores that the program handles, but intrigued by the themes.Gamers are often attracted to play a game again to explore tactics and strategies. RftG is a rare instance of me wanting to explore the mythology, much like Tales of the Arabian Nights.

However, I won't be doing so in face to face situations as the racing tension and play speed is lessened as you determine the current scores of the tableaux. I don't mind in 2 player situations, but evaluating the varying worth of the 6 cost developments is too much.

I did not enjoy my first game (4 players,) and after a couple more playes I'm still not interested in it.  My initial impression was that take San Juan, a clean, streamlined game and forcibly add a whole bunch of fiddleyness and complexities to all aspect of the game, bloating it to the point of disintegration, and you get this game. I don't feel that bad about it now, but nevertheless I avoid this game.

In my first game I felt the gameplay was more like hard labor than fun, but it is certainly not as bad as it's going to feel the first time. But the game does have a large aspect of a multi-player solitaire, everyone deeply absorbed in their own setup, largely oblivious to what everyone else is doing. Overall, this is an elborate game system of mostly short term optimization. It is not a complex as it might initially appear and gets easier  as you get more comfortable with it and get to experiment with different card combinations and strategies.

Fun game with reasonable play time. Fairly luck weighted, with player choices are based largely on being familiar with all the cards in the deck. It's not complex exactly but actually has a fairly steep learning curve in the form of speilized iconography to remember, and needing to have a good encyclopedia knowledge of all the cards in the deck so you can make informed choices. But you are mostly choosing what to gamble on for your draw luck. Are the other players racing it or do you have time to work for a longer term strategy? It's a game where each player is doing their own thing as best they can, but have little influence on other player's games. An appropriately named game, it's not demolition derby for the galaxy.

Sure, there are a lot of paths to victory but not all are equal. After a friend scored 59 VP after just a couple of plays I came to the conclusion that if a beginner can win with a lot of luck then a competent player can win with just a little more luck than others and this kills all interests I had for the game. I don’t like games that are a contest for luck. I want to play against players, not fate.

Difficult to learn, but a myriad of cards and different strategies. I especially like the different economic and military tracks, and blind role selection.

Edit: even batter with 3 players, fun guessing each other's role selections. Variety of cards really allows a multitude of strategies and helps make each game different. Beautiful artwork and a neat theme.

Race for the Galaxy (RFTG): Hi San Juan, hope you didn't mind me copying you.

San Juan (SJ): That's OK, you stole just enough that nobody could accuse you of printing the same game under a different name and theme.  I would have been pissed off but you took my game and changed it so that there was absolutely no player interaction, you don't feel the theme and you made the cards and rules far more complicated and fidgety than needed.

RFTG:  Do you really think so, I mean I really look up to you.  I am who I am because of you.

SJ: Look kid I really should be thanking you.  I was hot when I came out, got lots of plays but then fizzled out.  After playing you, folks will love to break me out again.

RFTG: But I will have expansions and new looks.

SJ: Come on kid, you can put a T-Shirt on a piece of crap but it's still a piece of crap!

RFTG: Come on, I'm not that bad, am I?

SJ: No your not that bad, but your not that good either!

This game is quite overwhelming at first.  The iconography on the cards is quite baffling.  My first 10 plays I still was just hanging on and trying to figure out how the game worked.  It's so quick that you don't have time to look at what other people are doing or really evaluate how every card will affect your play area.  I have been enjoying the game more of late, but I think it's because I finally know the cards well enough to be able to quickly determine which cards I want and which I can throw away.

Easily one of my favorite games.  Keeps getting more enjoyable the more I play.

RATING: 6.5
Not crazy about this, which surprised me.  I figured the space theme would hold my interest, but there are very limited decisions to make, and the iconography on the cards requires substantial memorization to play effectively.  I'd put it in the same category as 51st State, in that, although I like games with some meat on them, I don't want to have to learn a new language to play them.  
Might've just been my mood, though, so I'll give it another try some day.

Superb game.  The pictorial element in how the cards work is how I wanted San Juan to present information to me.  Despite the fact that this game is more complex, I found it faster to learn all of the cards due to their pictorial element.

With all the expansions this game really starts to shine. Now it even makes sense to try and achieve strategies using gene cards, and alien cards. In addition the Imperium vs. Rebels is simply so cool. Expansions really gave the military strategies the boost it needed to shine.

Without the expansions it's still a good game, but with the expansions it's simply more filling and balanced.

RATING: 8
A role selection game derived from Puerto Rico with a more appealing theme, shorter play time, and faster setup/tear-down.  There are numerous expansions which add various improvements but also make the game more difficult to teach, especially the last in the first series of expansions.  I note this because I don't get to play this as often as I would like due to the steep learning curve.

No, I can't get "into" this game. To many symbols and things you should keep an eye on and for me it plays to solitaire. Imo highly overrated CG. I tried it, tried it again, again, again.... Never again...

I guess you can chalk me up as one who just doesn't quite get the overwhelming passion for this game.  Even after you get used to the flow of play and symbols it seems like a middle of the road game to me.  It's not bad, but it's not great.

I have played this with actual live humans, and also on the excellent boardgamearena implementation.  This game is fantastic, and is far and away my most played game.  The card synergies are everywhere, but are often subtle, revealing themselves after many plays.  Initially this game felt to me a bit like multiplayer solitaire, as others have indicated.  After some extended time, though, seeing where your opponent seems to be going and hoping to draft off his/her actions becomes a fun sub game that really helps out your strategy.  The art is great and the theme is to me quite evocative.  Almost my entire experience with the game is the base game.  I think a military strategy is perhaps underpowered, but that's a minor quibble.  This is an exceptional game!

Great card game, doesn't take long to play at all once you get the hang of it. The first time I played it I definitely felt like I was building a space empire, which was a lot of fun... subsequent plays were more tense and concentrated on strategy. Can see me needing to buy expansions for it at some point in order to keep it fresh.

RATING: 9.5
This game took me a while to really get into.  I played this game for a little while and was really disappointed with it.  The game seemed too random and fickle and very luck based.  On top of that, everyone said I just had to "play more" to which I say that if a game can't show how good it is from the beginning it doesn't deserve the extra plays.

Then I played San Juan, and it was everything I was looking for that Race wasn't.  It was easier to understand, had more copies of the same cards so you had a better chance of getting the important cards for your strategy.  I thought it was the answer.

But eventually I got tired of San Juan.  It became predictable, and a little bit easy.  Then I went back to Race, and I couldn't put it down.  The game had suddenly turned into everything I wanted.  It was more interesting and had lots of avenues to winning.  On top of that, I liked the theme better and the cards were more interesting and complicated.

I had to play San Juan before I could learn to truly appreciate Race.

RATING: 8
Fun at almost the right length, it could be just a bit longer. Many aspects like San Juan, done just a little bit better. Takes a few games to understand the potential but there is not the need to 'know' the cards in the same way as is necessary in Agricola. Not sure we're playing it entirely correctly but can see where replayability may be an issue sooner rather than later.

Rating more likely to drop to a 7 than remain at an 8.

This game is garbage. If you disagree, I'm not going to be able to convince you otherwise; if you agree, then there is nothing more to be said.

Edit: I have been informed that this game is only as described above with only 2 players. Have not confirmed the truth of this yet.

Edit: Apparently 2 player is one of the best configurations. My experience showed otherwise.

See Roll for the Galaxy if you want to play a real game.

RATING: 2
A game that greatly disappointed me. I liked San Juan and expected to like this as well.

The devaluing of the role selection mechanic with the timing of those roles, destroys the interest i had in San Juan. In it the timing and the ability to deny access to roles is the game. The only interaction RftG is predicting the other players roles so you can ride on their coattails. 
The use of a space theme doesn't outweigh the degraded version of game play.
Considering:
the need to memorize many cards with the benefit they provide. 
the obtuse iconography, 
the gameplay which removed the primary aspect I enjoyed, 
it sounds like I should stick to San Juan, and avoid this turkey in the future.
To those who say you need to play it 5 or 10 times before it clicks, and you see the beauty of the game. I say rubbish. The first few plays have to show something of interest to justify the time, otherwise it is not worth it.

Fantastic strategy card game!  With so many ways to win and the randomness of the cards, you always feel like you're in the game until the end unless someone really gets lucky.  Also, you never play the same game twice with the variety of strategies at your disposal despite the limited card base.  Since I'm such a sucker for CCGs, it's not a surprise that RftG and Dominion (+ expansions) are two of my favorite BGG games.

One of the deepest game at this length. Still wish it was slightly less random, but then the replayability would probably suffer. However, since it's too hard to get into to be a filler in more casual groups and not long enough to fill an evening, I'm likely stuck playing this online forever.

RATING: 8
A good card game with lots of possibility. It look intimidating at the beginning with all the icons. But once you start playing, every thing falls into place. The rules are simple yet they could have hadded a couple of turn sequences in the rulebook for more understanding. The cards are of high quality and the graphics are superb. But on the down side, the icons are realy small and so is the text witch make it hard to read. Will come out of the closet often.

Très bon jeu de carte avec beaucoup de possibilités. Semble intimidant à première vue avec tous ces icônes. Mais lorsque vous commencez à jouer tout rentre dans l'ordre. Les règles sont claires et en même temps, l'éditeur aurait pu ajouter quelques exemples de tours de jeu pour faciliter la compréhension. Les cartes sont de très bonne qualité et les graphiques superbes. Par contre, les icônes et le texte sont vraiment petits ce qui rend les cartes dures à lire. Devrait sortir souvent de placard.

An exceptional game... The only reservation is that it suffers from a lack of interaction between players.

Somehow puts me in mind of a better Dominion ... but with no attack Kingdom Cards at all (which is a disadvantage). At least players have to take their turns simultaneously, meaning players can't accidentally race ahead of their turn.

A masterful development of the game mechanisms that first saw light of day in Puerto Rico and San Juan. Cards are used both for their primary purpose and for paying for other cards. There may not be much in the way of direct interaction, but the winner will usually be the player who has been the most mindful of the decisions of other players. Ignore your opponents at your peril.

A lot of iconology and very medium-heavy complexity. Hard to get into during your first or second games, but if you can get over the curve there are plenty of expansions to satiate your appetite for this game.

Probably the most fun with 2 players since there's less information to juggle and you might be able to interact a bit with your opponent. Otherwise it plays very solitaire-like at times even with the attacking variant.

I think this game has cool mechanics, but I just don't find it very elegant. There are just so many rules for a relatively short game that I find to be highly dependent on the luck of the draw to really be worth it unless you're willing to really dive in and play a lot of games. It does offer some fun and interesting decisions, but I prefer games that are a bit more elegant with their rules. 
As for the actual gameplay, it is very hard to engage in any strategy due to the very random nature of the draw. Sometimes your cards just jive together perfectly, sometimes you just want blue planets and can't draw them. Played this a lot on BGA.

This is one of my favorite under-one-hour games. It took me a few plays to get the hang of it and quite a few more to truly see the nuances of the strategy.

I greatly prefer this game with two players as you can fine tune your offense and defense strategies both by having only one player to focus on and because you can play two phase cards per round. Multi-player feels a bit more chaotic.

I have been playing this game several times a week since I learned it nine months ago.

I really enjoyed the feeling of building my little galactic empire. It's ingenious how the cards act as everything, from worlds to goods to cash. There's definitely a steep learning curve with the iconography but the player aids are quite helpful. I'm going to need to read the rules a few more times, but Race wasn't as intimidating to learn as I'd feared. It seems like it's going to be a great game for weeknights, and I can't wait to explore more strategies and possibilities.

The prospect of yet another "deck"-builder game had me grinding my teeth. I hate Dominion with a passion and the similarities seemed rather obvious, but here I am, admitting that I did enjoy RFTG after all. Of course, like Dominion, it lacks the player interaction of so many games which came out recently (Dominion, Dungeon Lords) and is more or less a mulit-solitaire game. In a 2-player game, it is quite fun to see what your opponent is up to, but am really doubtful whether I will be able and willing to follow the respective progresses of four players at all. The artwork is great so is the flexibility of the deck.

Favorite role-selection game (apart from Puerto rico). With a lot of plays for both me and my nemesis (best friend) we have our own playstyle now and guess each other's actions a lot better (so we try to trick each other). The "mandatory" Gathering Storm expansion gives you more routes to victory.

I like the mechanic of building up a 'tableau' with cards, but Race for the Galaxy falls a bit behind 7 Wonders for me.

I love card games.  I especially like card games full of all kinds of special power cards.  So I was predestined to like Race for the Galaxy though at first it really fell flat.

Each player has a hand full of role cards.  Players secretly choose one and all players reveal what they have chosen simultaneously.

The chosen roles are all performed in a specific order.  Explore, if chosen, is always first and Produce is always last.  They allow all players to perform the action that goes with that role, though the player who chose the role card gets a bonus.

There are two ways to get points.  Place cards into your tableau via Development and Settle actions or consume goods via Consume actions.  Of course every card you get into your tableau will likely give you some special power and the goal is to get the cards in your tableau to synergize so you can get the most points and then end the game.

The game immediately inspires a feeling of multi-player solitaire in that at first it feels like you can do just as well by ignoring what your opponents are doing as following their every move.  Repeated plays reveal this not to be entirely the case.  But you are still not going to get the crazy interactions that exist in games like Glory to Rome.  In some ways it feels like Race for the Galaxy has had all its rough edges smoothed over.  

The game is appropriately named.  It is very much a race.  Players rush for the endgame while socking away points.  Players draft, in the racing sense, off each others role card selections trying to get other players to do as much of their work as possible.  In fact lots of times it feels like the game goes by too fast and I wish I could linger a bit in the intergalactic empire I've created.  But thinking about the game as a race combined with the fun of finding card combos to make my economic engine run more smoothly than my opponents' has made the game a joy to play.  But more than that I love the theme.  Yes, I love the theme.

My first game of Race for the Galaxy was pretty boring.  But that night I literally dreamed about the cards I played and the worlds I had built.  I needed to play again.  While I had initially missed the game play elements that make this game a blast, the theme was calling to me.

Another anecdote for those who would malign Race for thematic reasons.  My brother-in-law was visiting.  He's a sports enthusiast and we had the basketball game on TV.  We were going to play some Race for the Galaxy and I didn't even invite him because I figured he'd want to watch the game.  Once he saw what we were doing he invited himself over.  As I was explaining the rules he suddenly stated that it seemed to him that the purpose of the game was to create your own identity.

And that's exactly what Race for the Galaxy does.  It allows the players to reinvent themselves and the galaxy with every game.

By the way, the expansions improve the game in my opinion.

(Maybe you're wondering why I haven't mentioned any issues with the icons.  That's because there were none for me.  An excellent reference card is included with the game.  After half a game of looking up the icons the system became transparent to me.  Whenever inexperienced players have a question about a card we just let them show it to the rest of us so we can explain it.  That way all the experienced players have the same information and a novice player is going to be playing more of a solitaire game anyway as they try and figure out the strategies.)

Played one 2 player starter game at the end of a long game day. It was my first play and my opponent's 20th or so. I went in expecting to be slaughtered, but I didn't go in expecting to make soooooooo many mistakes. I just couldn't get it! It seemed so clear when it was being explained and I complemented the designer on the seemingly clean way he indicated the phases of the card powers, but clean or not, it wouldn't stick.

I must have mixed up the VP and Cost icons a half dozen times and those are two of the most basic icons in the game! I couldn't remember what the windfall planet symbol was to save me and I never really grasped what a "Consume" action was. This was a starter game with the first expansion and my starting cards were war oriented so I decided to work for that, but when I played my 6-cost "get a bunch of points for each planet with a red ring around it" card, it was pointed out that it was actually a "get a bunch of points for each RED planet card". Ugh. Every other turn I was being allowed to take back my move because I'd screwed something up.

Maybe it was getting late or my brain was exhausted after 10 hours of games. Or maybe the rumors about the inscrutable icons are true.

I generally dislike games with lots of unique card powers and subtle interactions between those cards. I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised after having this game recommended to me multiple times by many people, but I don't think it's right for me.

I have, however, committed to giving it one more shot before I declare it a mismatch.

As a game design, this one probably deserves high marks. On a more personal rating scale, I'd give it a 3.

Played this game four times. Initial thoughts..is that it... the theme is pasted on, the game is very random almost like playing solitare, In fact in this game you are pretty much playing group solitare.

I cannot decide whether to give this game a 4 or to keep on trying it and see the "gem" so many others see. I will explore this game a little futher, but if some magic light does not come on soon  I will regulate it to the title of MOST OVER-HYPED GAME EVER.

EDIT:  It gets a 4 and is now, officially to me at least, the most hyped, over-rated game ever.

Unlikely to get past the dense iconography with my playgroup. We struggled with 7 Wonders' icons, this seems even less obvious, more difficult to grasp. Will give it a go at some point, I'm sure. ** And 1 year later, it's one of my favorites. I don't play it nearly enough, but it's brilliant.

RATING: 4
Simply not my kind of game. I don't particularly care for economic engine games, and I prefer games with a bit more confrontational player interaction.

However, I do agree that there is a good deal of interaction -- you want to figure out what role your opponents want to pick so you don't have to pick the same role (any role selected is performed by all players). I find this kind of player interaction somewhat annoying. I want to do more to my opponent than just pay careful attention to him or her.

**edit -we don't play this much now - I have easily played it over 10 times more than is posted her and I am honestly bored of it and prefer newer games, but it still holds a special place in our hearts/memories.**

My wife and I currently play 1-2 games almost daily!  She LOVES this game (as do I).  Although it took awhile to learn, the more we play - the more we like it.  So much so that I have a hard time convincing my wife to play another game.

Our Plays do not include the single player PC version found in the R4TG forums - incase you do not have it, go right now.  It is very impressive.  It includes expansions, has lot of playing options, only takes 10-15min per game. Played it over 100 times. HIGHLY reccomend!

Aqui sim, um jogo (cardgame) que diferencia os homens dos guris. Alto teor de brain-burn, decisões difíceis, mas ao mesmo tempo simples.

Cada jogador gerencia o desenvolvimento de tecnologias e a colonização de planetas no universo por meio de ações como Exploração, Desenvolvimento, Assentamento, Consumo e Produção.

Não é dos jogos mais fáceis de se aprender, mas depois que se pega o jeito, é difícil recusar a uma partida, que pode ser diferente todas as vezes.

Race for the Galaxy has executed the latest strangle hold on our gaming group.  Much like the introduction of Dominion, this game encompassed the entirety of our game nights for about a month.  Mechanically, it borrows from Puerto Rico in that each person's action selection allows every player to take that action (with a bonus to the chooser), but has the 'all you need is cards' feel of Dominion.  This element really can't be overstated, as the cards themselves serve all purposes from developments and settlements to be played to resources to pay costs and goods to be traded and consumed.  Really a stroke of genius in the elegance department.  Add in the fast play time and the fact that there is no real down time between players since everyone plays simultaneously, and this game is an ideal recipe for our game group.  I really can't recommend it highly enough.

Quick game to play, but pain in the butt to learn. Lots of rules and lots of icons to remember. Playing it face to face is annoying with the number of cards you have to track. Playing it online is much much simpler.

This game starts out as a good bit of a skill. Once you learn how to play and are playing against people who know how to play, it becomes a game of luck. Each player hoping to pull the better cards or the cards that fit the strategy they're using.

Six years on from the game's release and I still enjoy it as much as I ever did.  

The default way of playing it is "whichever of my copies I have closest to hand" - one is base Race, one has expansions 1-3, and the third has Alien Artefacts.  Though we never did manage more than a third of a game with the "Orb".

The upside:
-One of the most meaty card games there is. Great use of the flawless role selection mechanism of Puerto Rico.
-It's not like there's a lot of viable strategies to win, but more like there's a lot of ways to accomplish those main strategies.
-I like these types of games where you get a lot of punch for the time it takes.

The downside:
-The theme and symbols can be daunting for some.

San Juan is not the be-all, end-all of games, so why everyone is going gaga over a complete re-make of it (Race for the Galaxy) is kind of baffling. Since San Juan's strength IMO is its simplified & quick play, RFtG's increased complexity is not a plus. Add on the fact that just like in San Juan, there are highly unbalanced/overpowered cards that you can end up getting in combination with the support for them, and that will likely determine the winner against equal opponents. No clue how even one person could rate this a 10.

Every time I play this, it's the same difficulties in wrapping my head around the mechanics, card effects, and game flow. It is WORK, every time and everyone I've played with has agreed (noone is highly experienced in the game). I'm starting to question the balance in design, since it's too dependant on drawing synergistic cards to win - I'm thinking the military is too strong, and therefore New Sparta is an unbalanced starting world.
[b]edit - confirmed unbalanced starting card.[/b] 3 times I've started with New Sparta, each time I've won going away.  edit x2 - after many more plays, this is still true : New Sparta inordinately increases the win % chance.

I'm beginning to get sick of these games that have a metric buttload of text on the cards that require you to bring the game to a grinding halt just to read and understand what 5 cards you just drew do.

More plays later, this game is absurdly complicated, with sub-phases and card extensions to the standard (difficult) turn phase options. It feels like an accountant designed it, and requires a flowchart and legend to refer during play, and that's still not enough for most people to know how to play their cards - they require an expert to consult to know how to plan their hand.
[b]Not[/b] a good trait in a game.

I'll quote Richard Garfield on game design : 
"Gratuitous complexity is a rampant problem with trading card games. When I look at a card, I don't want to see a lot of attributes that matter only one game in 1000, or conditional effects that are minor and seldom come up."

RATING: 3.9
Very disappointing.  I am generally considered fairly smart, but the rules of Race for the Galaxy are bewildering, and I consider the game extremely unfriendly to new players.  After three plays of RftG, I still felt like I was stumbling blindfolded through a maze, banging my nose on places I couldn't go, with no idea where the goal was, let alone how to get there. And I'm not talking about depth of play, or experienced players overwhelming inexperienced ones, like in chess; at least in chess you can play the game [i]correctly[/i] (even if badly) with 10 to 20 minutes of explanation, instead of being told yet another bloody exception every time you try to do something for the first hour of play. I might grow to like this game as much as I love San Juan (one of my favorite games, similar to this one in principle) after more plays, but I sure don't [i]yet[/i]. (After reading other players' comments...) Agreed completely, there's no reason to ever look at anything the other players have played, unless you don't trust them to play fair (or correctly), or to see whether they need 1 or 2 more cards to end the game. "Multiplayer solitaire" is pretty close to the mark, except for the bewildering and unjustifiable fact that someone else's action can force you to sell your production for a victory point right when you needed more cards, or something like that (still not sure what happened or why).

If San Juan is too predictable, or if someone always grabs the role you wanted to take this round, then this game can go a long way to curing that for you.

Learn San Juan first, for sure. your life will be easier when you sit down to this one afterwards.

I like this game as much as Roll for the Galaxy at this point, but for different reasons. Race just feels like you are putting together more combos for your engine. In Roll there seems to be more emphasis on manipulating the dice. I like both, but Race makes me feel smarter as I put together cards to build an amazing engine. The one detractor from Race compared to Roll is that the simultaneous action selection is a bit more choppy as you look at your hand and then at the phases, followed by the card flip over. This is a minor hit, but I find the in action selection to be more fun in Roll, while more rewarding in Race. Overall, they both get 8's and I love them both for their length and level of strategy. This is a great combo if you have an hour. You can play a game of Race and then a game of Roll getting your fix for both systems. I recommend both, unless you hate dice for Roll, or you are not looking for a challenging learning curve for Race. **Wife:8

I have played this game hundreds of times.  One of my favorite card games.  Getting past the iconography can be a challenge and does make it more difficult to introduce to a new player.  But if you take the time to learn this one you will be rewarded.  Be sure to pick up the expansions if you buy the base game! I deducted 0.25 rating points for the iconography.  If you can get through that, you will be rewarded with a great card game experience.

This game requires some time (a play or two or a thorough reading of the rulebook) in order to familiarize oneself with the system of icons used on the cards and with the mix of cards in the deck. The main system of interaction with the other players is through the role selection phase in which players simultaneously select one of seven roles to play that turn. Since each player has an opportunity to perform all roles selected by all players on a given turn, anticipating what roles will be selected by the other players will help one maximize efficiency.

I'm a bit 50/50 with the great. First of, I really love the whole Master of Orion -style build your own empire and see it work. All the combos and the ways you can customize your empire (be it military, production, doing specific goods etc) is great.

On the other hand, I feel it's a bit of a solitaire since there's really no player interaction. I feel depressed when I watch what my fellow players are doing and realize that I don't need to bother to find out. They have tons of cards in play and figuring out what their strategy is seems pointless. I wish there were more player interaction in this otherwise cool game :)

At first sight, there is no interaction between players. After a couple of games you realise that you should always see what the others players are going to do. You define two extreme strategies: militaristic one and the economic one. The first one is fast, the second one gives more points. The first one works if you have 12 military planets. The second one takes more time to be implemented. 
Then you can imagine all strategies possible in between these two strategies. Most of the time you will do one intermediate strategy because the others players are influencing the game in one or the other and you must adapt to their strategy.

A great game.

RATING: 8
This game wins the award for most visually intimidating. However, once you know the basics of how to play, the cards are fantastic, because they contain so much information. On first glance it looks like you have to learn a new hieroglyphic language in order to play.

Do not be intimated this is a fantastically rich, space empire building game, that takes no more time than most filler games to play. There is no direct conflict in this game, but you will feel like there is, when your opponent triggers the end of the game just before you complete your carefully ordered plan for galactic supremacy.

I read that the icons were confusing. And they were. But slowly, I've learned from the rulebook and the forums. And now I see the masterpiece that is this game.

The game only has cards and victory chips. That's it. So for that it's great because there's not too many things to fidget around with.

Secondly, everything is in card form which makes the game replay value sky rocket.

Third, the game plays in a way where downtime is minimal and is fast.

Finally, player screwage doesn't really happen. An action benefits all players, just some benefit more than others.

You get a great-looking, highly strategic, highly replayable game. I undoubtedly recommend it. It only took two plays for me to get the game and now I can't wait to play it again.

*I've been playing it a lot and every game is different. This might be my #1 right now.*

RATING: N/A
I think RftG could be a great game, but it has a really difficult learning curve. I have played 4 or 5 games of it now and I still find myself getting confused about what everything does. It makes it very difficult to form a strategy. It's a game with a huge number of options at every turn, quickly leading to analysis paralysis. I think I will enjoy it much more as I become more familiar with it, but I still feel lost playing it.

Part of the problem is the iconography. Although it is well considered, the idioms are not intuitive and many of the icons are similar enough that remembering the differences becomes difficult. It also greatly increases the learning curve because you not only have to learn the mechanics and the strategy but also the meanings of all the icons. Instead of acting as a memory aid, they become a foreign language that must be learned before the game proper can be learned. I find myself wishing the cards had more explanatory text or else a reference book that detailed each card for when the iconography becomes ambiguous.

I also find I have trouble establishing a strategy. This may be because I'm still learning it, but it may also be because there are so many choices, or it could be because the starting hand and planet have a considerable effect, or because so much depends on what cards you draw. I can't tell exactly which factor makes it difficult, but it's currently quite frustrating.

I can't give this a solid review just yet, other than to say that this probably won't go over well for new board and card game players. Consider this a game for experienced and patient players only.

I only started playing this game about a month ago, but I can tell that it is going to have interesting strategic depth for a long time.  The great thing about RftG is that each planet and development adds a new strategy and something eles different to think about.  Each phase does something drastically different for each player, and a player must consider their own strategy as well as the strategy of their opponent.  I am really good at having a strategy and putting it into play, but I am less effective and examining my opponent's strategy and conceiving a strategy that will make his plans more difficult. This game has so many layers of how a player can and should act, which provides a remarkable amount of depth to a game that is basically a bunch of cards in a box.  This game is worth purchasing because it can be played for a long time.

Now I've been playing Race for a while and it is still freaking awesome.  The expansions add a lot, my favorite thing they add is the extra start worlds.  The only aspect of the base game I started to find boring after 100 plays were that I was still using the same old start worlds.

The depth and complexity of building each tableau which turns out so different from the one before it, is mind boggling.  I am so glad that I learned Race for the Galaxy!

Feel like I need to play 20-30 more times before I get a feel of the cards and their uses.  Looking forward to the expansion though...now that I've played 20-30 times, I love this game.  The learning curve on the cards is steep, otherwise this game rightly deserves to be a top 10 game in my closet.

This is a much more complex and involved version of San Juan.  Oddly, it also feels a little more random (luck dependent) based on the uniqueness of nearly every card.  A very cool game that has a lot of replay and enjoyment, but not nearly as streamlined/limited as San Juan.  Still fresh and extremely interesting after hundreds of plays.

A great, quick game that is definitely not as interactive as I'd like, but the theme and pacing help make up for it.  Expansions were announced before the game released and it does feel like they're preventing the game feeling "complete."  Still, it lies pleasantly between a meaty city builder and a "filler" game.

RATING: 8
I've really liked this game a lot, but so far have found most people I've played it with struggling to see what I see.  I think that the iconography is brilliant and elegantly implemented, allowing to easily understand what everything does, but again, other people I've introduced it do have had big problems understanding how all the cards work together.

All that being said, I really enjoy the process of trying to create a machine that works for you and figuring out a path to victory that makes sense based on what you start with, etc.  I'm a huge fan of the victory point generating combos, and often find myself leaning towards them, but have had an occasional military strategy net success as well.

The more I play this game, the more I see differences between those that have played it a lot and those who are just getting comfortable with it.  I think the people that are just getting started with the game get distracted with trying to do too much, or going from whatever interesting card they have to the next, rather then focusing on one particular method of getting victory points.  For example, having great military, but still putting effort into trading, etc rather then conquering to end the game.

I have a feel for the game now and can win against Keldon about 50% of the time. I like this, but I'm finding it hard to get my play groups interested. It's definitely a game that rewards familiarity so hopefully I can continue to shove it down their throats until they "get it."

A few cards too far? With so many different cards, there are many strategies, but you can pretty much only play the one based on the cards that come through your hand.  It is certainly fast and colourful, but there is a lot to track if you really want to mess with other players. Played as a solitary engine-building game it is quite good if that is your sort of thing. For me, I like the concept but the already limited interaction of San Juan is lessened because it all becomes too hard.

RATING: 6
This is only based on one play,so it definitely has room to move once I get a grip on the icon system and how everything fits together. It definitely is a San Juan-game with more going on, the question is whether that makes it a better game or not.  On my first play, I had enough trouble figuring out what I was doing, let alone trying to anticipate my opponent's play.  If the game is manageable to the point where watching over other's play becomes viable, then it will probably have moved up some in my rankings by that point.

I've played a couple more times and I'm not sure my rating will change after all.  My problem is that this is a game that is fun if you play it regularly enough so that the icon curve is non-existent.  Unfortunately, I don't get to play games right now enough for that to be true.  With more frequent sessions - I could see wanting to play this more and hence a higher rating.  Definitely play it though if you have the chance.

(When rating games I focus on the "how likely I am to play this game again" part of the BGG description rating, as opposed to the "quality" part of the rating.)

TRftG is very similar to San Juan, but it is quite a bit more complex (actually has the distinction of selling goods for money or for victory points as in Puerto Rico) and has asymmetrical starting conditions. After a few games vs. AI on the PC, it seems to be very dependent on your card draws, and it is about what the best is to make of your draw.

This game is really multiplayer solitaire. If you have quite some experience and play it with only two or three players, you might guess what actions your opponents take and benefit from these. Compared to other games (even others marked as "multiplayer solitaire") this is still on the very low side of interaction.

I have now played a second game. Although it is somewhat interesting, the game does not reach the higher levels some geeks are giving it. I found that much (too much?) depends on your starting strategy, which in turn depends entirely on... luck. If you get the right cards from the start to build a winning strategy - and one which you'll be able to advance, then you,re set. If you get a fuzzy mish mash of unrelated cards, your level of strategy and skills will count for shit.I have lowered my rating from 7 to 6.

High learning curve as it is. I'm worried the expansions might make it insane. Very similar to San Juan, but better. What I like is that San Juan feels like certain cards are definitely better than others and there are a couple winning strategies. What I like about this game is that there seem to be many paths to victory. Not all cards are good for all players.

UPDATE: Got kind of tired of this game, and I think I was right that the expansions add a little too much to the game. If Dominion had never been invented, would this still be a top game for me? Perhaps, but considering that this game started as a 9, it does not bode well.

Well, the designer has certainly cleverly figured out how to get myriad functions out of a single card (something Up Front did 25 years ago).  I have three plays under my belt and am beginning to understand what is going on but the fun factor has not kicked in yet.  While the artwork is nice I am not feeling the theme at all while I play.  Although the cards primarily rely on the icon system there is some text, which if I don't have my glasses there is no way I am going to be able to read.  If you are a fan of resource engine games there is plenty here to like.

I can appreciate the design of this game.  I love the art.  I love the sci-fi genre.  But I just can't get into the groove of this game.

I like, and I'll play it, but it always feels like solitaire to me.  My wife and I have played many games together, and we both have a decent time, but truthfully, I play because it's moderately interesting to me and relatively short.  I guess I'm looking for more interaction.

Having said all that, for $25 it's probably one of my most valuable games in terms of #of plays over cost.

The first time I played this was a fiasco, the rules & icons weren't explained clearly and I had no desire to ever play again.  Nearly a year later I went ahead and played it twice more.  This time the rules & icons made sense.  [2009 JUL 16].  After recent plays I am losing what interest I had in this game.  Mostly seems like card churning.  Rating lowered to 5 from 6.

This is an incredible card game.  I can see the variety in game play.  You kind of have to decide and make the best of the cards you draw but avoid spreading yourself thin or the end could sneak up on you.  I can see the possibility of this rating increasing with play.  the only grievance I have is that the directions and card symbol do take sometime to understand but once you get it, it a great experience.  The theme does feel a little pasted but overall work well and the artwork is very nice.

Clever and engaging efficiency game. The theme is captured better than I expected. Lots of tough choices. Doesn't overstay its welcome and plays briskly once you have a couple games under your belt. Has a "let's play again" quality. 

On the other hand, it's not especially interractive. Luck of the draw is pretty strong for such an analytical design. And ultimately, each game is forgettable. RftG doesn't immerse or generate a memorable narrative.

Have someone tutor you through a couples games face to face. Then install the AI version and play it a few more times.

Quite easily one of the most luck driven pieces of tripe ever made.  You can win 10 games in a row and lose 10 games in a row due to nothing but complete luck of the draw.  Lehmann is a hack, POS designer with no intelligence of what makes a game playable.  Yahtzee has more skill than this utter shitstain of a game.  This septic dump of a game is easily the worst I've ever played. Honestly if I could give this a zero or lower I would.  This game is essentially all luck once you know the cards and combos.  With evenly skilled players the game plays itself by the exceedingly random draw it gives.  Adding more and more expansions only makes that worse.

update: The more I play this game the more I know it needs a mulligan rule.  I've had games where you starting hand is so bad you have lost before you can fix that with random draws.  I've started with multiple 6 cost developments in my hand or all military worlds with no military to play them or no production or windfall worlds for several turns.

The only good thing about this game is that it can be quick but if a player takes time to count out each card it turns into a miserable waiting game with little to no fun to be had.  What could be a great game boils down to card draw luck factor and whomever draws better wins.  Eliminating any level of skill a player may have.

All in all it's inherently flawed as is and needs many fixes as there is no way to mitigate bad card draw.  San Juan isn't much better but at least it limits the exceedingly crazy draw by the costs and same starting cards.

A fairly simple card game with a very limited level of player interaction (the only interaction is the rather subtle phase selection mechanic at the beginning). Players build up a series of worlds and developments which score them victory points, the highest victory points winning.

The mechanics, game play, and feel of the game are those of San Juan and Puerto Rico. I think I prefer this to Puerto Rico but am undecided when compared to San Juan (which I also see as superior to Puetro Rico). All three games are so close that only one of them is really needed but I've not invested enough time or thought to know which offers the greatest depth. This is slightly tormenting me as I know one of these games should be in my games cupboard but that all three of them are pointless repetition.

Took me a while to understand both the rules and strategies of the this game, which if i had rated it then, it would have been a mistake.
Having over 100 matches on boardgamearena i have to say its grown on me.  There is lots of replayability, its easy to setup and quick to play. Considering the expansions now....

The main downside to this game, is the time it takes to teach it to others due to the iconography.

Would suggest that gathering storm is the only expansion worth getting if you want solo play.

This is one of our most played games ever, with great long-term survival.  It's years old and still hits the table regularly.

It's short. There's almost no player downtime.  There isn't a lot of player interaction, but enough to keep it interesting.  You have fun even when you're losing, because you can still do things.  There's no elimination.

We play usually with expansion cards but no expansion special rules.

Most of my experience with RftG has been as a 2-player game (the "advanced" version where both players select 2 phases each turn) - but even in just this form it is one of the deepest and most replayable card games in existence. And, while it gets better with expansions, the above comment applies to just the base game on its own. (Compare with Dominion, the only pure card game I rate higher than RftG - both are improved with expansions, but Dominion needs several to reach the true heights of greatness, while RftG is there already with just the base.)

The fact that it plays in just 20-30 minutes is also great, as you can roll off 3 or 4 games in a row. I'm terrible at this game (my winning record in 2-player games with my wife is probably less than 10%), but I still love playing it - there's so much to explore; you learn more every time you play as you get more familiar with the cards, but it plays totally differently each time based on the order the cards come out in. An absolute classic, RftG fully deserves its place in the BGG top 20 (it has fallen out since I first wrote this, as was inevitable, but it still deserves to be there), and indeed I would even say it's generally underrated around here.

For me, race has the just the right mix of luck and strategy and incorporates all of the best aspects of Puerto Rico - role selection, economic development, etc. The setup time is drastically shorter than PR...it's less fiddly since it's a card game, primarily. The icons on the cards are at first gibberish, but after a couple of games, they become one the games greatest assets. You don't have to memorize all of the card's abilities, nor do you have to read small text on each card, each turn in order to determine what the card does. A quick scan and you know whether or not you get a bonus in a particular phase of the game...genius design. The only knock against it is the learning curve. While similar to the learning curve for PR, I find race slightly easier to teach since you don't have funny rules about the trading house and shipping....instead you have other funny rules. But, for some reason, people seem to grasp this one easier. Quicker setup and cleanup and easier to teach nudge this to 9. Superb game!

UPDATE: I've downgraded this to an 8, but only due to comparison against other games in my collection.

(7/2/08) - Received this today as part of a trade for my 3 Power Grid expansions. I was just too impatient to wait for the reprint I guess!

(7/30/08) - Played this for the first time today. While I'd love to give it a knee-jerk 8-9, which is how I would rate it at this point, I know that RftG is the kind of game that needs multiple plays before its true colors show. In this case I think more plays will mean an even higher rating.

(12/04/2008) - I meant to rate this back in October when I got a bunch of plays with it. Several games has shown that this is an excellent game. I have only played 2-player matches so far, but have enjoyed each one immensely. Once you learn the basics of the game, go right to the Advanced 2-Player Game, it's great! I look forward to playing with 3 or 4 players and seeing how much things change.

I'd consider getting rid of San Juan for this, really; they're not substantially different and I like the space theme even though it's just window dressing.

I'm not entirely sure what all the fuss is about. Not a bad game at all but it just doesn't do much for us. Maybe it is the theme or the icon learning curve or too much going on or too little interaction but my wife and I have not really enjoyed it at all. The surprising thing is that we are not even interested to play it more to discover it's hidden joys. Tons of hype for this one but I guess it's just not for us.

Update: Just revisited this game and busted through the learning curve wall. Really enjoyed this game. Looking forward to more plays.

A great, fast paced game if everyone knows how to play. Because of this, you can play a game in a pretty short amount of time which allows us to play several games in one sitting. The advanced rules make this game great with two as well as four people.

This was an interesting game. I didn't find the iconography as difficult as most people sat. However, I had already played Roll for the galaxy first which helped a lot. I like how you are building your cards to have great combos. Fun and a fast play. I do think I prefer Roll better though. Mostly because I think the tiles and dice make for a cleaner player area and easier to keep track of things.

I think RftG is a tad overrated. And the replayability grossly overstated.

Still, it's a decent game but there's both too much and not enough on offer here... too much because it takes a few games to wrap your head around the game, but not enough to keep you, or at least me, coming back to it.

I'll be adding a couple of expansions right away (thanks to keldon AI I can afford to give the game a chance to change my mind) and hope it can sustain my interest over the next evening or two!

Played far too many times on BGA.  

It's difficult to put my finger just yet on how I manage to be bulldozed by the good players and manage to do the same to inexperienced players myself.  The game is all about tempo, when to draw the game to an end and also knowing what your opponent is trying to achieve so you can piggyback on their actions.

I see no issue with the iconography; certainly when it comes to the base game.  It's elegantly designed and should come easy to players within the first couple of games or so.

A truly great game - am sure that will be able to convince the wife to give it a try.  Just not sure if she'll be willing to put in the initial hard graft to learn it!

Not the kind of game I normally enjoy, but somehow I enjoyed my one playing.  The iconography is pretty good, and I can see that it wouldn't take too many more plays to become familiar with the deck.

I have thousands of plays of this. Need I say more? It plays quickly, has beautifully designed mechanics, and plays differently every time.

little interaction cept a little bit of 2nd-guessing. need to know all the cards to play well and then its just a self-congratulatory wank-fest.

update - def better when u finally learn the cards and not unappealing.

 prob better than dominion 

rating after 10 plays and prob final rating - 7

its appealing and a nice game to play with ppl who know it - packs a fair punch into the playtime but still just solitaire racing

oh and can be v random at end with 10pt swings easily possible

btw playtime with 4players ~30-40 mins

update: rating may be dropping to 6...

RATING: 8.1
Race for the Galaxy finds it's niche and fits there perfectly. The card game CCG players will love and not have to spend a fortune on. It does have a bit of a learning curve, and isn't entirely intuitive. The icons can be confusing for new players, but function well with familiarity. The game has good pacing with virtually zero downtime; though there is virtually zero player interaction as well. It's entirely about efficiency and how well you manage the cards that are dealt to you. While this game encourages strategy, if you don't draw cards with synergy, you will likely lose to someone who does- regardless of strategy. The game plays so quickly, though, it's easy to play a series where that luck can be mitigated.

This one hit a resonant chord for me more than San Juan did.  I suspect the iconography which is ordered by phase helps a lot here to see the advantages of each of the builds.

with just the base game: better if you don't use starting worlds and keep 6 of 9 in initial draw.  More strategic 2 player, more guess work multi-player.

VASTLY improved by the first expansion.  The base game was not the game the designer created initially -- the publisher split it into a base game + 2 expansions, but it was originally designed as one game.  I think it is best played as originally designed, with (just) the first 2 expansions.

**Update: No good explanation for it, but I'm now basically willing to play this game any time.  It's not a staggeringly great game, but it is consistently fun and quick.  Awesome.

Rating after two plays with two players and three plays with three players.  The comparisons to San Juan are certainly apt.  I desperately needed my glasses.  The text on the cards is so small it's just silly.  Still, the game was fine with the beginners' starting setups.  The game seemed just as fun and interesting with the random start as it did with the fixed starting hands.  Overall a pretty enjoyable game.

RATING: 4
I've played twice and won the first game (and maybe the 2nd can't remember), but I'm not entirely sure how.  Part of the problem may have been that I was playing with experienced players who played quicker than I was comfortable with, along with a rather quick rules explanation.  Suffice it to say I felt rushed.

The iconography sometimes works, sometimes feels overdone, and a lot of the time more use of text would have been better.

The games I played felt rather random and were mostly multi-player solitaire.

I purchased the game before I played it, and thus it ranks at the top of my list of purchases I regret.  My own copy has been punched but not actually played.  I do plan on trying it again, but not sure I will given that there are other games I would rather play/try.

Multiplayer solo game. Yes, there are other players, but you dont need to mind about them. As some people has pointed out, you can get some advantage from predicting other people actions and act in consequence (ala Puerto Rico), but other than that, there is no interaction.

Too random for the first plays, until you get knowledge of the cards, options and strategies.

I will look for the expansions that adds more interaction (which lack of is my only niggling complaint), as overall I think the game is elegant and well designed, with a nice theme and a short duration that helps to get it played.

A Sci-Fi version of another card game, "San Juan". I think that "RftG" is better, but you´ve to get used to all the symbols, so be patient and give it a time. It´s a very good card game, but Spanish edition is a little "strange" (I mean, colors of the cards are dull, and cut of help sheets are funny). Its digital version for iOS is VERY GOOD! I always play it in digital format (PC or iPad). I recommend it!

Amazing engine building game, it's so clever and diverse, no wonder it became a favourite game for many people including myself.

On top of that Race plays very quickly so it has unbelievably high depths to length ratio and decision density.

The first game in a while that I'm truly excited about and have played as many times in a short period. Some of it has to do with the sci-fi space theme. There's a shortage of those in the 'Euro' camp as everyone knows. I like the card interactions and variety much better than in San Juan and I appreciate the work that went into icon system. I'm looking forward to the expansions to see how everything fits together in the end.

----------

I learned RftG after I played Glory to Rome.  I honestly expected to like GtR better, but I actually prefer RftG because of the production/consumption mechanic.  Trying to build a lean, mean P/C machine while finding synergies to multiply your VPs is incredibly addictive.  The military strategy, on the other hand, isn't nearly as much fun to me because I feel like I'm just mining the deck for the +military and military-focused 6 devs.  

love all of the variety in this game.  I think it's deeper than Glory to Rome, but it definitely has more of a solitaire feel -- which I don't mind.  

I think GtR has more variety out of the box, but RtfG's 3 expansions more than compensate.  However, I do feel that adding all three expansions into the game increases the luck of the draw in the game; adding the super-search role (Brink of War) is a nice idea, but the issue still exists.

I feel like Base + Gathering Storm + RvI is the sweet spot.

This is my #5 game.

All of my plays, with one exception, have been solitaire using the Robot A.I. from The Gathering Storm. These comments are specifically in regard to the solitaire game.

[b]What I Like[/b]
:d10-1: The game plays fast. I can think my way through a game and still get done in under a half hour.
:d10-2: It's a challenge to beat the Robot. I've only played on easy difficulty. After improving my game play I am now able to beat the Robot approximately 50% of the time. I'll soon start increasing the difficulty.
:d10-3: Each start world has different abilities. For the player, this means cards in your hand will vary in value depending on the game and will affect your strategy. 
:d10-4: The Robot has a different play style for each start world. These unique play styles will affect the player's strategies as you will want to avoid selecting actions that complement the Robot's strengths while seeking actions that minimize its abilities while positively affecting your own.
:d10-5: The huge number of different cards will ensure that the options presented to the player are different each game. 
:d10-6: Maybe not a big deal for some, but I like the theme. While others find it too generic, I feel it is suitable.
:d10-7: Once learned, the game play is logical and actually fairly simple.
:d10-8: I think the iconography used is a great way to clearly communicate card abilities without cluttering up the cards with text that could be misinterpreted. 
:d10-9: Small boxes don't take up much space and are easy to transport.

[b]What some people may not like[/b]
:d6-1: This will vary from player to player, but the learning curve will be steep or hard to understand for some. The different phases of game play, bonuses for selecting actions, the subtleties of correctly following the game play sequence, and the wide variety of planet/improvement abilities may combine to make this a tough not to crack for some players.
:d6-2: The iconography may increase the learning curve for those who prefer text.
:d6-3: The theme may appear too generic or pasted on for some people.

[b]Summary[/b]
I think this is a great solitaire game. It plays quick, doesn't take a lot of space when playing or when on the shelf. Each game plays out as a unique experience due to the variables in card draw. The A.I. Robot can be tough to beat, even on the easiest difficulty, which is as a solitaire game should be.

--Feb2007-- Played a prototype a couple times a year ago.  It's got great mechanics, but isn't particularly clear on first exposure: I suspect a card manifest would have made learning the game easier and more rewarding.  My eldest son will likely be amused.
--Nov2007-- Production version is pretty nice; glad to have bought it.

 This isn't really a game you can bring out for casual gaming friends, and the learning curve is pretty steep.

Hardcore gamers will love this. Lots of strategy, easy setup and cleanup, etc.

Another minor qualm I have is that there are a million different symbols on cards, and they take a while to learn. In a couple instances, the same symbol means something different in different phases, which is a personal pet peeve (and only adds to the learning curve).

I really enjoy San Juan and this is just a deeper more involved version.  While I really enjoy the various 'engines' it seems that with such specific card combinations, luck of the draw is even more intrinsic to this than it's predecessor.

Still, this is quite fun...  I just wish there was a bit more player interaction.

Once you can find people that are willing to learn this game, it is a lot of fun! Works fine with 2 players, though I prefer to play with 3-4 players. I'm looking forward to picking up the expansions so that I can play with 1-6 players instead of just the 2-4.

I honestly cannot rant about this game enough, everything is so perfectly made. There are always new surprising strategies in the cards, they all match together so well, everything is amazingly balanced. I cannot think of a single thing I would change about the game. I suppose if one were to complain about the game, it would be the luck factor, you can have a game just go wrong because of a bad series of draws. Really though, its short enough (a bit over half an hour once you are familiar with it), and the theme is so fantastic, even if you have a bad game due to luck you just want to play again right away anyway.

Quickly established itself as one of my very favorite games just a few plays in. I got this game out early in my gaming career--too early. I realized a few minutes into looking through it that it was too much. Six months later, with a good amount of gaming experience in the interim, I opened the box again...and by then I was ready. I would strongly recommend anyone interested in giving this a try--but put off by the perceived complexity of it--to give San Juan a try. Learn that one, and then Race will seem like just another step forward.

RATING: 9.8
Unbeatable replayability & thus value for money. Would be a 10/10 if you didn't need 20/20 vision to play! I just cannot see what other people are doing - a definite disadvantage. There ought to be a "large print" edition, or at least Seven Wonders card size and quality.
Update 1/2/16: Have now played it at least 100 times. Rating remains the same, and it is the game which sets the highest standard when comparing other games. A particular board game wasn't as much fun as we'd hoped? No problem, enough time for a quick RFTG! Having only used 2 expansions so far, it is easy to see me ending up having 500+ plays of this game.
Update 17/3/17: Have now played it at least 200 times, without yet having used Xeno expansion, hundreds more to come. By the way, just out of interest, I came across Galaxy Trucker and Suburbia as a result of studying the highly rated games by Race for the Galaxy devotees (ie 10/10), as I also consider RFTG as possibly the very best game, but do wish to maintain variety in gaming. This approach seems to have worked.

RATING: 10
Very nice, but not great.  Highly *tactical*, but how your *strategy* works out is pure chance.  Far to random wether you pick up those darn 6's or the power-consume planet you need;  once a player (per chance) gets his (whatever-)engine going, he's gone... Poor theme (should've stayed ships'n'colonies).  As a side note, I now like San Juan even less.

Card game is heavy, like RFTG. The weight of this game lies everywhere, such as its background (ultra space, totally alien to me), components (a card can function as money, goods, star etc), gameflow (five different phrases, simultaneous), and indicators (solid circle, hollow circle, red circle...). It takes me like 20 weeks to fully understand this game. Beginners still prefer the military strategy because there are less things to mingle with...

RATING: 7
After all the hype not convinced yet about this. The rating is only after two-player game but there are definitely a few problems with this game. I guess the game is supposed to be compared to San Juan so let's do it so:
 
What I love about San Juan is that even though it is quite deep and strategic game where it's essential to know the cards to do well - it's relatively easy to pick it up and start playing by new players. Not so with RftG. Even for a seasoned gamers and people who have played a lot of SJ it takes time to understand all the different symbols and their meaning on the cards. The symbols are well designed and when understood work quite well but somehow it seems there are too many variables going on. The game could have easily been simplified. 
 
The game plays quickly even with the complexities but with different resources, different types of planets (rebels, aliens, etc) and different action types there seems to be too many parallel things going on. There seems to be many different strategies involved but it might prove too difficult to pursue any of them if the cards don't come up as wanted. It also seems that the game will become even ore complex since some things were left to the upcoming expansion.
 
It's certainly a game for gamers and SJ veterans who want more of the same but it certainly seems to be lacking on the design side.

Very enjoyable innovation on resource gathering/production type-games.  No setup time required and simple idea--yet somehow it ssems that the end result is greater than the sum total if its individual parts.  Those elements that may seem borrowed or inspired by other games are here because they provide good strategy foundations.  Few points for artwork, and it seems that the card designs are both spartan and somehow busy at the same time (this will no doubt improve in future editions, which I have to believe will arrive one day), but that does not make it any less fun to play.  Score has increeased with future replays--I think the rules were technically well-written, but were so precise that we missed several key points (also due in part, no doubt, to the fact that my friends all have ADD and will not read directions and that I, also, am mostly mentally challenged!).  For example, we did not understand that it was unnecessary to collect VP chips for constructed development/planet cards--somewhat major part of the game. The cards seem to be wearing out quickly due to the black-colored card  backs--particularly with the role cards which are handled constantly, and some are used more frequently meaning that they may reveal themselves before they are turned over.  Minor semantic quibbles, though, for an inventive, fun, quick, and addictive game.  This one is a classic.

Chris (?) posted a terrific tutorial which amounts to:
* Give each player a premade starting hand.
* Tell the players you're playing as if you're in the middle of the game.
* Have all the players place their starting hand on the table and have a hand of NO cards.
* Discuss the anatomy of each card EXCEPT for icons during the phases.
* Have each player select the LAST phase and play each phase from last to first.
* Explain the icons ONLY for those cards which do something during the phase.
* When you finish the tutorial, you can continue the game, or start over with the premade hands.

Why:
* Understanding Race's icon grammar is difficult, especially when most games actually don't have icon grammar. This tutorial gradually introduces icons. Also, players aren't overwhelmed by the icons in their hands because they have no cards in their hands until halfway through the tutorial.
* The first phases taught in this tutorial (production, consumption, trade) have the least decision making within the phase.
* The tutorial uses the same premade hands you can play a standard game with. By the end of the tutorial, the players will at least be familiar with their premade hand.

***

Race can be easily played as a "two-player game played by one player". It's one of the few games where the base game does a *very* good job standalone.

I haven't played TI, but I'd say Race is a hand management game. The toughest decisions are deciding what cards to keep, and which to throw away (you discard cards to "pay" to put other cards into play). The game is also a classic opportunity cost game -- you must play your turns more efficiently than your opponent. 

***

The first time I played Race, I was astounded that the Military didn't have any effect on the other players. Then, I assumed, the Military was more like the Klingons. :laugh:

Anyway, it's "interaction" by BGG standards. It's not Ameritrash interaction -- nothing blows up, and all that. 

It *is* interaction in that you have to analyze not only everyone's face-up tableau, but how many cards they hold in their hands. Race isn't solitaire, in that I've yet to play a solitaire game in which I deduce my opponent's move and plan accordingly. If you play the game MSP, you will lose.

Here's a tip: If you own the game and are looking for a solitaire game, play both sides of a two-player! The game's easy to setup, and doesn't take much space. I play during the load screens of my computer game on my crappy Compaq laptop.

As a former CCG'er, I enjoy Race. I like the synergy, and min/max'ing when you play off other player's actions. But if I want to blow something up... Well, Nuclear War is still in the closet!

***

Coming late to the thread, but this is one great review. I play the game almost several times a day "solitaire" (by playing both sides of a two-player game) and enjoy it very much. Race, by far, goes on my "The Game I Most Regret Listening the BGG Comments on Before I Played It" because, as a former CCG'er, I picked up on the mechanics of the game in only one game. Compared to Magic's banding mechanic, this stuff's a cakewalk. I'll add that the icons on this game make the game *easier* to play than with text. Fans of Race use the "leeching" strategy to deduce the plays their opponents will make, and it's easier to read icons on an upside down (or sideways!) card than text.

*****

Here ya go: 

General strategy: Draw as many cards as you can. Not only will this allow you to pay for your cards, but will open options. You may get to the point where you have two very viable options and can't decide. Flip a coin.

Blue: Consumer engine. Play as many cheap blue planets as you can. Play the developments which convert blue goods to victory points. Select the Consume 2x phase. 

Brown: Mining engine. Look for the brown developments which combo with the brown planets. You won't have the runaway consumer engine like blue has, but, IIRC, you will be able to draw cards faster than your opponent. 

Military: Draw cards. You want the military goal cards. You will also want to keep a military planet to play onto your tableau when your opponent calls Settle. While military is easiest to understand, it's not easy to win.

Goals: Well.. yeah. :laugh:

c) Study your opponents tableaus and hand sizes, and deduce which phases they'll select. If possible, manage your hand so you can put into a play a card during another player's phase.

This is *not* your typical Euro strategy game. It's a tactical hand management game, with (and don't tell anyone on BGG this) a good dose of CCG strategy (draw more cards than your opponents, and memorize which cards are in the set). Despite this game being derived from a Eurogame, its plethora of cards and icons make me think of it as Ameritrash as any CCG.

***

Haven't playe SJ, but have played CCG's:

* Theme: It's not the tired old fantasy game, but it's not the boring trading/farming/sheep stuff, either.

* Combos: aka. Engines, synergy is a big attraction for this CCG'er. Despite the variety of cards, you only have to remember how each color's engine works (and it's typically Consumer Blue vs. Miner Brown). 

* Deduction: Guess which phase your opponent(s) will play. Again, something that isn't in most CCG's. Amusingly, if your opponent(s) have *no* idea how to play this game, they'll easily thwart your attempts to out-think them.

* Tactics: None of this non-intuitive long-term planning bonus points crapola. 

*****

You make your own luck.

One of the basic strategies that appears in card games is to draw as many cards as possible. This is obvious in Dominion and Magic, but not as much for Race and Cosmic Encounter. Yes, you don't know what card you're going to draw. But the more cards you draw, not only will you increase the chances of getting a card you can use, but you will have other cards to pay the cost.

Notice that I used the words "cards you can use", which does NOT mean "cards you want". If your strategy depends on getting a certain card, or a narrow range of cards, you will lose the game. A basic Race strategy is to have a *flexible* hand and tableau that works well with a wider range of possible cards drawn.

Like Glory to Rome, Race for the Galaxy manages to be its own worst enemy by making its ruleset seem unnecessarily convoluted.

This game feels like it is half of a really amazing game. I like the feeling of machinery as your cards interact with each other and build up to something, and the never-the-same-twice potential, but it really does strike me as though all the rules about how players interact with each other were left out of the copy of the game that I played.

Edited years later to add: this is notably improved by later expansions but I don't remember which is which so I haven't rated them.

Packs a lot of punch in a small box (which, btw, could be smaller). It is a great game, specially after you've played a couple of times and start to know the cards. It doesn't rank higher because of the "icon" system it uses. Once you learn it is quite good, but takes a LOT of time for most players to get used to it...However, if you endure, you will be rewarded with a great game :)

This game hit me right away after first playing it. I learned Dominion first - I wonder how learning RftG first might have changed my appreciation for Dominion... I can't wait to get a bunch more games in - I wonder if my knowledge of RftG will change Dominion's stance in my ratings after a while.

My first play. And as I read in other relations I was also confused in the start. Then I got it. I knew what the most of the symbols means, and I even by luck got some strategy rolling (by having a good planets, and upgrades to tjose planets I could produce and sell, so I got for one green resource card seven cards!, later for one addition blue I could get 1 VP).

But I liked it. And I want to play it again. I was sorry that we didn't play it again right after the first play, but.. some of us didn't have a time.

This, after one play seems like a great game. I think that this could be much better than San Juan which I tired of a little. Once past all the symbols this flows well.

A very satisfying game with enormous strategic variability. There are tons of interesting ways to combine card abilities and mechanisms, each of which can lead to surprisingly successful strategies. I appreciate the simultaneous/shared execution of the actions - it creates a sense of balance and agency, since no one player gains any huge advantage by taking an action alone. I also like the precision with which players build their tableau MUCH more that this mechanism's cousin (antithesis? Evil twin?) - deck-building. This is essentially deck-building in reverse - rather than selecting specific cards and casting them into an entropic pile, players draw from a random pile and use the cards they have to create something very specific and fine-tuned. Sure, card drawing is random, but there are enough draw-adding mechanisms to greatly mitigate this.

It needs 1-3 plays to better understand rules and card interaction. Once you have a grasp, it's a fairly fun galactic empire building card game.

This game made me really mad when I first learned it. I had heard that the symbols were really difficult to learn but I think that was a major understatement. I learned the game myself and had noone to teach me anything. I would recommend learning to play with someone who has already played. 
Once you get past the learning curve I find the game to be awesome. I love the game because it eliminates what I don't like about puerto rico. It gets rid of all the pieces and setup and improves upon puerto rico by allowing more options for victory. I experiment everytime I play and find new ways to victory each time.

Excellent card solitaire with some requirements for a good insight into the minds of other players. The mechanics is nice and offers a lot of interesting gameplay choices and a lot of tactical and strategic depth. The layout and iconic info systems on cards is a work of genius.

Fantastic. Wonderful.

The theme really permeates this game, but doesn't detract from the strategy and essential nature. The luck-elements are enough to make each game different, but can be mitigated enough to mean that skill and thinking are vital. The artwork and symbols lead to a very attractive game, and the play is quick and easy. Indeed, my play-count is undoubtedly well off because we play this so often, both between games and in several-game runs, it almost always is just taken as read.

The similarities to Puerto Rico are there, but the game plays differently. I can't wait for the next expansion.

RATING: 1
so pointless...so devoid of contact...so tedious and unthemed...so needlessly icon-ed...makes me lose faith in the act of gameplaying altogether...

turns out a great way to make Puerto Rico even worse( I know, right!) is set it in space and make it rife with hidden knowledge.

More complicated than San Juan.  Lots of different strategies to try.  I think it is better than San Juan but not suited for non-gamers whereas San Juan is easier to teach.

Visual Appeal: (5)
Some of the card art is just good, but most of it is great! I happen to think the symbol system of organizing information is a very good one. With a little invested time, they become second nature and they don't clutter the cards. The discard and draw piles can get a bit messy with many expansions added, but the game generally looks nice and compact on the table with no board and minimal chips.

Components: (4)
The cards are a very durable linen finish that feels good enough that I chanced not sleeving them. Since I usually play with all the expansions I was afraid of making the decks even more of a mess to shuffle every game. The VP chips are a decent card stock and a reasonable size. I like the personalized player phase cards. They make it easy to see what phases are happening and you can just turn them face-down when the phase is over to eliminate distractions.

Theme: (4)
This game has a theme of space exploration, research, and military struggle. I feel like all of the themes are represented well by the mechanics. Although it is highly thematic, I don't like the takeover rules from Rebel vs. Imperium. I feel like it slows the game down and diminishes the reason why it's a "RACE for the Galaxy." The variety of card synergies in the game populate the RftG universe with diverse worlds to explore.

Learning: (2)
I label this a 2 for the benefit of those to whom I've taught the game. To be fair, it took me a while to become comfortable with the symbols and the cards too, but most players just find this overall a difficult game to learn. There are player aids to help new players but the synergies take experience to spot. The number 2 complaint that I hear is that they try to follow a certain strategy but the blasted cards won't come up! It is hard to teach players how to just go with the flow when they want to think of a more long term strategy right out of the gate.
Gameplay: (3) 
I like the challenge of predicting your opponent's phase so that you can benefit from it each turn as well as your own phase. There is little direct player interaction without the take-over mechanism in place. I remove it by choice because I don't like it, but if you choose to use it, you can actually steal an opponent's hard earned planets! 

Overall Fun: (5)
I have fun with this game and I don't care what anyone else thinks. It is a fun medium-heavy card game with a good implementation of phase selection and hand management. Lately I've been playing most of my games on the Keldon AI servers. I enjoy that the program has ongoing support and that I can play against a very competent AI opponent.

RATING: 5
This is the second most complicated card game I've ever played.  Up Front being the first.  With repeated playings, the mechanics and the meaning of the symbols becomes easier.  However, I don't feel the game has enough player interaction.  I played a 4 player game that I won, and not once did I ever really care what my opponents were doing.  I guess I'd put this game in the category of games I'm willing to play but will never purchase myself.

Don't like this. Probably giving it a lower score because I'm comparing it to San Juan. They've taken an elegan, over complicated it and extended the game time. Lack of player interaction is also a problem (probably not as much as SJ due to the shorter playing time), making it a distinctly solitary experience.

This one has me hooked. The best space civilization game there is. I keep discovering new patterns and strategies every time I play. I really like how the card concepts relate to the mechanics. 

The game has not lost its replayability for me after 200 games, especially with the way they did the expansions.

RATING: 7.5
It was explained to me as San Juan on Steroids.  I liked it a lot better than San Juan.  The basic flow is very similar but I liked the simultaneous  role choice and trying to guess if the other players will take the roles you need.  I am also a sucker for both space an civ games so it definitely scratches and itch.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fiddly retheming of San Juan, with a wider variety of cards and actions. I'm not sold on the 'everyone wins' role selection mechanism; the original seems more interactive, and also gives you another decision point. RFTG's approach to roles and its increased card diversity seems to emphasise luck of the draw versus San Juan. Still, a good game, worth checking out.

I've heard the 2P version is more interactive, and I'm keen to give that a go.

RATING: 10
Plusieurs choses frappent lors des premières parties de Race for the Galaxy : le thème SF, malheureusement sous-exploité par la plupart des éditeurs ludiques, la qualité des illustrations, le nombre d'icônes.

Les premiers points permettent largement d'aller au devant de la première difficultés du jeu, découlant du dernier point : les premières parties sont pour le moins laborieuses et confuses. Il ne faut surtout pas hésiter à aller au delà : les parties sont rapides et dès la troisième ou quatrième, vous pourrez ranger les aides de jeu au fond de la boite.

En ce qui concerne le jeu lui même, on retrouve tout le feeling et la richesse d'un JCC. Le système de pioche et de défausse de cartes s'apparente au tirage de boosters et à la construction de son Deck tout au long de la partie. Du coup, on se retrouve avec les meilleurs éléments du JCC (la construction du deck), sans les défauts (le côté automatique de la phase de jeu, l'aspect collectionnite et mercantile). C'est, il me semble, le tout premier jeu à réussir ce tour de force, et ça donne un jeu nerveux, riche, original et addictif.

Il n'y a pas (encore ?) d'interaction directe dans RftG. Cela semble rédhibitoire pour certains, qui semblent associer automatiquement la SF au grands combats spatiaux ou aux conquêtes pour le contrôle de la planète voisine. Pour moi, ce genre de raccourcis dessert la SF plus qu'autre chose, et c'est un excellent point que de voir développer des thèmes plus subtils dans ces mondes futuristes. De plus, on n'est finalement pas trompé sur la marchandise : comme son nom l'indique, RftG est un jeu de course, et l'objectif est bien de faire plus de points, plus vite que les autres. L'interaction se trouve donc finalement plus dans les phénomènes « d'aspiration » (on profite des actions des adversaires pour avancer plus vite) que de blocage. Et c'est peut être aussi ce qui fait tout le sel et l'équilibre de cet excellent jeu.

NOTE: I own two copies, the US version and the Chinese version from Hong Kong. Actually, it's 3 now since I co-own Dan's copy too.

Will never turn down Race. Real men play Race. Race is great. If I can rate Race higher than 10, I really would.

UPDATE: Well, the coveted 10 and "favorite game" spot has been usurped. I have, in fact, been feeling like I could turn down Race all the time. Has 270 plays really burned me out on this great game? Maybe. But really, I think it is because I want to play of a variety of games and now that I no longer have a weekly meetup group of gamers, I would rather my evenings not be filled with only Race.

RATING: 9
In Race for the Galaxy players are racing to achieve the preeminent civilization by settling planets and gaining technological developments.  The winner is decided when one player has at least 12 developments and planets in play or a set number of victory point chips have been exhausted; the player with the most victory points wins.  Each turn players secretly select which action they are going to perform, then simultaneously reveal their selection.  Each action selected will grant an action for all players during that phase, with an additional bonus to the player who chose the action, so players must carefully consider not only which bonus they want on their turn but what actions the other players will choose.  The actions vary from drawing cards, developing a technology, settle a planet, trade goods, consume goods, and produce goods.  Actions are activated in the same order each turn (drawing first on through production) regardless of who played what; in this fashion there is no "first player".  The cards in Race for the Galaxy function as either a planet or development, a good produced on a planet, or currency; this will force players to consider their options each turn based on the cards in hand, deciding which will be used to pay for the others, and this is not always an easy choice.

Each planet and development are worth victory points at the end of the game, but some planets allow you to consume goods for victory points.  Other planets allow you to consume goods for more cards.  Some planets can only be conquered with military might, others can simply be settled by paying its cost in cards.  Some worlds produce goods, some produce goods and cards, others just produce cards.  Both worlds and developments have special powers that activate only during certain actions, so players must carefully choose how to use their planets and developments in order to obtain more victory points than the other players.

With the variety of planet and development powers and the dynamics of the action choices made each turn, Race for the Galaxy tests a player's ability to build a strategy on-the-fly, and then adapt and refine that strategy as the game progresses.  Players must always be aware of how their action choice will impact their opponents and work to maximize their own gain.

Really enjoy this game -- I like trying to plan my moves based on what I think other people might be doing.  It's like simultaneous PR -- but instead of trying to figure out 4 moves ahead, all I need is one move ahead -- but with so much randomness based on what people have in their hand, I'm less likely to guess right.

Which I like.

Fun, quick game.

One caveat -- this is the anti-gateway game.  Do not try teaching this to newbies -- they will be lost forever.

I played it a couple of times and would gladly play it more, mainly from the bewilderment that it's so highly rated. Very little interaction, little theme (typical to card games) and a feeling of playing a mostly-solitaire (not so typical). As with many card games, the chosen strategy is a direct consequence of card drawn, you don't have much choice in the matter or occasions to adapt it to other players' actions.

No other game in my collection has come close to Race for replayability. This year we finally mixed in Brink of War. It's seen steadily increasing plays between my wife and me year on year for 5 years now, which has got to mean something. If we're in a hurry, we can get a game set up and played in about 12 minutes, though usually we take our time and make it a luxurious 25 minute experience. And we're STILL noticing little details on the card art. Best game of 21st Century. If learning the icons is a struggle for you, it may be worth weighing that against the likelihood of getting hundreds of plays out of the game.

Have only played once, so rating could change.  This game seems to me like it can depend a LOT on your group, so make sure you slow it down if you're playing with new people so they understand what's going on, what cards you're playing and why, etc.  The role selection mechanism is interesting, and while I enjoy San Juan I'm not quite sold on this one yet.  I'm a fan of iconography like that on the cards, it may increase the learning curve a tad but once you "learn the language" it makes the game much more aesthetically pleasing.

A more advanced version of San Juan with a populist space theme. There doesn't seem to be as much player interaction with the multiple character role cards available to each player. After a few games I'm not really interested in exploring this any further. There's multiple paths to victory - as long as they involve either trading or picking up the right military worlds. At the end of the day though (if you strip out the "wow cool, space theme"), all you've got is an abstract card game with non-confrontational player interaction. How... "nice". Look, I'm glad so many people are enjoying this - I recognise it's a decent game - I'm just not very interested in it myself. I must say that I do find it somewhat relaxing because it just completely sucks the competitive urge out of me. I can sit back and just not give a damn - I'm just not that into it. Now, if I don't care - is that the best way to spend my precious gaming time? Not the best challenge for the other gamers at the table either. Plus, this game will ruin your eyesight.

This is hard to rate game:  You feel it is a great one, but at the first plays you don't enjoy it at its best, cause you don't know the cards and its combinations.  Players try to dominate the galaxy picking different actions, such as explore, develop, settle, consume and produce.  All players will perform the action you select, so you will need to choose the one that is comparative better for you, or worse for your rivals, thinking in what they would pick.  There are several ways to win, and every game is different, depending of your initial setup and hand.

I love this game but it never gets played, so I started exploring the solitaire mode included with the Gathering Storm expansion and it's fantastic! It's a bit intimidating to look at at first but once you get it everything makes sense.

Enjoy this one, though I'm NEVER able to get it to the table. Always provides great decisions to make in which cards to play, which cards to pay with, what direction to build.

I'm hanging onto it, though, in the hopes that I'll find a playing partner.

I caved due to the hype.  I'm not a big fan of San Juan so I had my doubts.  However, I like it better than San Juan.  There is a steep learning curve and it takes time to get adjusted to the game.  Patience's is required while teaching, I hate teaching this game, and allow some time for new players to check out the cards and icons.  Our early games took forever with tons of things to consider and absorb.  I want to like this one but no direct player interaction, I'll give it a little more time...

UPDATE:  This game needs a dedicated group of people to play enough to really start to see the possibilities here.  My friends and I have very limited time so this game rarely sees the table due to new players and the information overload while learning. San Juan seems to come up more often due to it's "simplicity".  What a shame because once you learn, this is a fast game to play.

My number 2 favorite game, after Runewars! Great gameplay and infinite strategic possibilities in each game (although, lately that leads to a little Analysis Paralysis for some people in my group). A bit hard to teach but the game has a great learning curve and after 3-4 plays anyone can make up strategies and play competitively. I think I will NEVER get bored of this game! The expansions make great additions to the gameplay (especially the goals) since they create variety and give the game a lot of replayability.

Picked up like new from gamer on Craiglist.  I had played Roll for the Galaxy and San Juan before playing this, so it wasn't as intimidating as some folks make it seem.  I really don't understand all the hype this game gets for being so hard to learn and play.  I didn't find it much different than any other game with icons, rules, cards, etc.  Once you start picking it up, the game plays very smoothly and provides good quick and strategic game play.  While I like that it plays fast, it feels like it ends just a bit too soon.  But I guess you can say that about a lot of games. I think I prefer this Roll at this point.

This is one of those games that I have a hard time puting away.  Its extremely addicting, and expererienced players can play through games in 15 to 30 minutes.

I have a hard time teaching people this game.  The cards have so many symbols, that it is very frustrating playing through the first few games.  Once you become familiar with the mechanics and sybols, it plays wonderfully.

Not a great theme, and there is not really a story to tell at the end.

All card games have luck involved, but a good RFTG player can adapt to the cards and come up with a strategy I havent seen.  TONS OF REPLAYABILITY!

After only two plays, I get the sense that this will, in time, become one of my favorite games (and will therefore probably hit "10" sooner or later). I am really into this exact type of game right now - games that make you decide between deep strategic play and just racing for the end and as many early points as possible. I am only now starting to see the deeper strats available in this game and I am excited to go deeper still.

RATING: 7
A nice design that feels frustratingly incomplete - the strategic lines are perhaps a little too delineated when they should be more fluid, which may be a symptom of too much of the design have been cut away to make the basic game actually playable.  Once those first couple of learning games are out of the way, it certainly holds the attention, but it still isn't totally intuitive - even now the myriad of modifications that a card can do can easily be overlooked accidentally.  Having said that, it's got one of the best UIs of a complicated card game I've ever seen.

Plays track games against human opponents and do not include games against Keldon's AI. 

Fast, strategic, and fun. Has a fairly steep learning curve. The iconography isn't that bad, but knowing what you should be doing strategically takes a while to figure out. 

There is a fair amount of randomness, and a large part of the game is doing the best you can with what's available. It's important to set up a card economy, and find ways to leach off of the phases other players choose. 

For a game that takes me 5-15 minutes to play, this game offers a great deal of strategy and variability. Race for the Galaxy packs more decisions into a 10 minute game than most games that last an hour. 

The first expansion arc is fun, but has two main problems.

1: It makes the deck too streaky, and adds a cludge factor to help deal with the problem that disrupts the smooth flow of play.

2: There is significant power creep, and some cards from the base game are overshadowed by better cards.

The second expansion arc does a better job of preserving the value of the base game cards and manages to improve strategic diversity without adding so many cards that the deck becomes too streaky. The main issue with it is that the Orb is not a good addition, since it drastically slows down the game and interupts the smooth flow of play. Fortunately, you can just ignore the orb and add the cards in.

San Juan and Race for the Galaxy are very similar games, mechanically. Each round, each player selects one role (producer, trader, etc.) and then all players perform the actions associated with that role; the player who chose the role receives an extra benefit. In Race for the Galaxy, the role selection is done simultaneously while in San Juan it is done in turn order. In both games, cards have multiple uses: they are played to a tableau to build plantations or settlements or developments; they are used to pay for the buildings being built; they are used to produce goods on plantations/settlements which are later traded in to get still more cards back into your hand. The object of both games is to build out 12 cards in your tableau and have the highest combined score resulting from those 12 cards. Both games involve hand management, choosing which cards to hold onto for building later and which cards to spend for building now. Essentially, they are the same game with different themes. San Juan, however, is much easier - it has a lower barrier to entry (the cards have explanatory text in English, whereas Race has a system of icons/hieroglyphics), but less variety, less depth/fewer strategies. San Juan is not a gateway game, it's got too many rules to be that, but it is a good gateway into Race. Race is the "step up" from San Juan. But, if you're not likely to play often, or with the same people, I would advise going for San Juan over Race - the barrier to entry for the latter can be enough that you may never get to play.

I actually find I connect more with San Juan, Race can be a bit overwhelming. I find, right or wrong, that I tend to enjoy a game a bit more if I have a good enough understanding to compete well and win frequently. I can do that in San Juan - I've never won a game of Race. The trouble with San Juan is that the strategies, once learned, become rote. It's still enjoyable to manage your hand and make the decisions on which cards to keep and which to spend, but at a certain level, these really aren't "decisions" any more - if you're playing a certain strategy then certain "decisions" become dictated/automatic. There's more going on in Race, more ways to win, so this sense of putting the game into "cruise control" doesn't happen as it does in San Juan. But, then, I've played San Juan over 100 times, using the AI, and I've only played Race a few times. Perhaps, once I've crossed the century mark with Race, I'll have the same feeling of "cruising" through the game....

Right now, I have both games rated 8.5 but their ratings are headed in different directions - Race has the potential to go up as I come to grips with the system while San Juan is likely to go down as it becomes "cruised" out.

An absolutely fantastic game that gets better the more we play it. A complex and deep game with a variety of strategic paths to go towards depending on your start world and initial draw.
Highly Recommended for 2 or more players.

RATING: 9
While the criticisms about how tough it can be to teach new players are true(I've seen many a glazed over/confused look on people during the first couple games)... but once it clicks the games are fast, deep and always interesting.  Short games combined with interesting choices make it easy to get to the table.  And I've enjoyed any player count(usually 2-4) so far.  Other great things are that it is reasonably priced and very quick to setup/tear down.

this may be close to the perfect card game.  Every round offers different decisions.  The game is the perfect mix of strategy and tactics.  Plus, the quick play time always leaves a "let's do it again" feeling.  Great game!

I think I'd rate this higher for 2 players - maybe 7, but I really dislike it for 3 and 4 players... so I'll average that out to a 6.

I'm becoming more and more of the opinion that player skill can plateau, and after that point it really comes down more to what you draw (and when) than what choices you make. While Id argue it's certainly possible to be better at the game than someone else, and under that plateau the better player will win more of the time than a worse player, I don't really feel the game is worth playing anymore once you get to that plateau, or even approach it.

I'm posting an initial rating after my first two games -- a crazy, confusing storm of coaching from other experienced players, with me just trying to keep up and make a few unsound decisions of my own. I was surprised by how short the game can be. There's not much time to plan, build, and use what one has built. The game could end long before such plans can come to fruition. I'd increase my rating if there was more time to get involved in each game, to really investigate the consequences of creation.

Whenever the opportunity arises I'll play again, but I doubt I could teach this game to any casual gamers I know. Hence, I don't expect to get much better at this game, but it's possible to appreciate it somewhat from afar.


Update: I finally bought it, and I'm learning how to play better each time. It still feels like it ends too quickly most of the time -- not in terms of minutes elapsed, but in terms of decisions made.

RATING: 7
Not a big fan.

Good: conveys feel of Puerto Rico very well; satisfying for 2 players (not blatantly zero-sum, and simultaneous role-selection works for 2 players, in my opinion), infinite replay value

Bad: very, very steep barrier to entry; not fun with more players (too many cards to keep track of, don't like simultaneous role-selection in multiplayer games, becomes near-solitaire as you try to cope with the overwhelming information set), player interaction is often governed by luck (you picking Settle when your opponent just happens to have no cheap worlds, hidden information in cards); rewards experience too heavily, due to remembering what every card does and knowing general strategies (related to steep barrier to entry); and most importantly, very quiet game where talking to your opponents only interrupts their thinking.

I don't mind playing this game with 2 or 3 experienced players (2 especially, since it's fun despite not being zero-sum), as it offers quite a bit of interesting mental gymnastics in short playing time. The doublethink and what you think your opponents will do gets too overwhelming with more tableaus, and the game becomes more solitaire than intelligent piggybacking/leeching, which is the best part of the game (more than finding cute combos). Would not bother introducing this to new players. Totally silent gameplay, you could hear a pin drop when people play this.

4+3

Believe the hype!

While it's a very good game, I think it's a bit overpriced for what you get component-wise. It's just some average-quality cards and a handful of chits. But it has an overdimensioned box, which easily fools you into dishing out more money for it than what I feel the components would be worth.

Well, it took me an eternity to finally play this one and I have to say it surprised me.  I thoroughly enjoy it as I am discovering the different nuances that it has to offer.  It can have a bit of multiplayer solitaire to it, it's true, but that doesn't make it any less fun!

After some added plays, I am really falling in love with Race.  There is definitely some subtle nuances in the gameplay that first-timers will not pick up on.  I'm always up for a game on BGA!

My only problem with Race is that if you get a bad draw or don't pull any 6 cost Devs, you can get buried through no fault of your own.  Still a solid 8, tho.

I've upped this to a 9.  I can't quantify it into words as to what it is about this game that I love so much.  Even after 1000 plays, I still want to play it over and over again.

I've played my fair shart of Race over the past few months.  I'm still completely sure how I feel about it.  Let me start by saying that I enjoy the game and have enjoyed it since my very first game.  Still, there seems to be something not quite right.

For one, I'm still really not all that good.  I do occasionally win.  However, when I do win, it does not feel like I have done a whole lot to actually manage to succeed.  It feels like it is mostly luck.  But, hey, it's a card game, so there is going to be some luck.  

I guess I sometimes feel there is too much luck.  That is what keeps this from being a nine and may doom it to a seven before it is all said and done.  The biggest problem is that I seem to frequently have games where I cannot get anything to go my way.  Every now and then, once per session, or something like that, it is easy to deal with.  However, it seems like I always manage to string 2-3 of these painful games together at a time, and it just kills the enjoyment for me. 

Still, it's a lot of fun and a lot of bang for the buck.  I'm happy to have it.  [04/07/2009]

Or loose to whoever did happen to be lucky enough for one of those to happen.

This is a fun, quick moving game that is still strategically complex. The learning curve is a bit of an obstacle, mostly (I think) because the mechanics are rather abstract, with cards being used as game pieces, as currency, and as goods, and card powers being presented in the form of icons. It's a bit like learning a new language. Once you get the hang of it, though, it is very fun and challenging. The random element of drawing from a deck keeps the game interesting; you can't rely on simply pursuing the strategy that worked for you last time, you have to be able to work with what comes your way.

This game grew on me after a lot of plays.  It is a great filler, but it does need to be played quite a few times before a player knows the cards well enough to make it a strategy game instead of pure luck.

Just played our first game of RftG.  Understanding all the symbols was confusing, but the rules were well laid out.  Even our group of four first time players picked up on the interactions between the players, and tried (with mixed success) to predict the actions of the other players.  So I definitely don't agree with the argument that the game is just multiplayer solitaire.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Well I wanted a 2 player game which would be complex enough to keep my brain occupied. Lots of data, lots of options, some risk evaluation, but you can overcome all sorts of stuff if you adapt. So far, I like it a lot. Be warned though, learning curve IS steep and may cause frustration is some players, as it takes some time not only to understand the pictograms but to remember all the details of the rules. As far as player interaction goes, yes it's not directly confrontational and the interaction might be very low, but it exists on 2 levels. One is predicting which phase the other players will choose and if you got your psychology right you can potentially profit a lot. Second thing: it's a race. Oh, and the third thing: the card you're looking for, might be hidden as a good, or it might have been discarded by another player. So you're making decisions on relatively low information. 

For me it's the first card game since MtG that has the high level of complexity, plus manages that on a very lower card count (Blue Moon just doesn't work for me) and with different kind of gameplay. If you like simple games, games you can grasp in a shor amount of time, this might not be for you (I think of it as exact opposite of Lost cities - less stressful, more complex), but if you think it is for you, you might need some time to persuade other people to be patient for the first 5 or 6 games. 

EDIT: It is quite MPS and I tend to play more interactive games, but the 100+ cards still give you a lot to choose from even if solitary. Doesn't overstay it's welcome.

I had been curious about this game because of comparisons I had heard between it, Eminent Domain, and Glory to Rome. I had been hesitant to try it based on its intimidating iconography, but felt draw to it because of the space theme and how well-like this game is,

Having played it, I can definitely see the appeal to people that like to develop combo-engines. I do like games that are more aesthetically pleasing, and I just feel that Eminent Domain is an improvement over RftG in both aesthetics and game-play as you choose which actions to take to build your deck rather than hoping to draw cards that further your strategy in RftG. 

The two aspects that prevent me from really liking Race for the Galaxy, is 1) I don't want to have to learn a foreign language just to play a game (the iconography) and 2) your strategy is really dependent on the cards you draw, and if you can't draw the right ones, you'll lose.

Initial impression: I'm excited. I do like San Juan and I hear this is a more gamer's version of that. My first two games were interesting exploratory forays into the strategy and it looks like there's some potential.

I kept hearing about the iconography being a big barrier, but I think that's mostly hype. It takes 10 minutes to learn and you have a card that interprets everything anyway.


(5 plays): This game looks good. I've seen several different paths to victory and it plays fast--two things I look for in a game like this. 8.

8 plays: Hmmm... this is starting to feel a little more repetitive than I had guessed it would. I'm already wondering if this needs the expansion. Also, there is a fair amount of luck--I find that when I've picked a strategy it sometimes works, and sometimes I just don't get the cards to carry that one out. Still enjoy it overall, but finding it hard to rate. Now a 7.

#38 on my Top 100 Games of All Time (2015)

This was another early edition to my collection of designer board games. I still remember trying to learn it myself and being completely confused. We just tried to make sure we were actually playing correctly, there wasn't any room left to actually think about strategy. I recall it was my third play where it finally clicked, and I was like 'OH. I should base my role selection around what I think he's going to choose!" I do like Roll for the Galaxy even better these days, but this game will always have a place in my collection. It's just excellent.

Sometime ago, several designers were asked to submit designs for a card version of Puerto Rico. I belive that this was a rejected submission that has subsequently been redeveloped into a new game.

Update: I have finally played the game and yes, it is very much an SJ derivative. Only this time, everyone gets their own set of role cards to choose from. There's much more to the game because of the many different effects the cards have on gameplay. There are also additional 'role' cards that lead to more varied strategies etc.

However, someone Tom L has managed to make the SJ experience even more solitaire. The agony of selecting roles is lost as players are essentially fiddling with their own tableau of cards. Plus the symbols and text...oh my. Expect to spend a few games just to get around what the symbols mean and how they interact. Also, this might be me, but the graphics aren't appealing at all. They remind me games released in the mid-90s when PC rendered 3D effects were popular (Princess Ryan's Star Marines anyone?).

Left me a little cold. I'm hoping that future expanions allow player to interact more. For example: it seems logical for a military world to try to take over other players' worlds etc.

Based on one four-player game. I think it would take another play or two to develop a strategy. I could also see where knowledge of the cards might effect your strategic planning.

Edit: After playing dozens of games against AI, I've decided that this game requires that you study and learn every card in the deck, which isn't fun for me. I'd rather play San Juan.

Edit: After playing scores of games against AI, I've finally figured out how to play. I kind of like it now, but a game shouldn't take that many plays to figure out.

Boring, low interaction, complicated, luck dependent, kind of ugly, muddled graphics, AND problematic for the colourblind, like me.  Easy and Kozure say it improves w/ familiarity, but it's not interesting enough for me to want to become familiar.  Probably, I'd rather play Go Fish or Old Maid.  For reals, yo.

Race for the Galaxy was one of the first designer games that I purchased when I was getting back into board gaming in early 2011.  Some might call Race for the Galaxy (RftG) "Puerto Rico: The Card Game," but it's better than that and many other card games after have started to utilize the multi-use card mechanism of the game.  I'm not very good at the game, but really like it and wish I could play it more oftwen.  Sadly, it has only managed to hit the table one or two times at my game group and I suspect that this is due to the [i]perceived[/i] learning curve for the iconology prevents people.  In reality, the iconology in 7 Wonders if just as bad, if not worse, and I think people just hearing about all of symbols in RftG have scared them away before they even try the game once. In reality, most people pick up all of the iconography during the first game and then want to play again right away.  Hopefully, I can convince my group to play this game again in the future. Otherwise, it may just get a lot of solo play.

SOLO PLAY:   Luckily, the Race for the Galaxy: The Gathering Storm expansion enables solo game play by providing a unique robot AI player. The robot AI works very well and offers a challenging opponent. I have only manged to win once against the robot so far, but the biggest win is that I'm able to play RftG solo and get value more from the game.

RATING: 8.2
Ahh, RftG. One of those games you can play again and again yet never truly master. The core is good enough to play and be happy with for many sessions, and with any luck Rio Grande designed a great alternate pathway for the game's universe to follow.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Create an intersteller empire one card at a time, with both economic and military paths to victory.  Somehow shares the "build a machine within the framework of the game" aspect with Dominion.  Only downside is fiddly iconography; useful once you've learned the game but a barrier to new players.

RftG plays quick and has great strategy that I can appreciate. For some reason I don't 'get' this game. I feel bad saying this as I really like sci-fi; part of me feels as though I shouldn't rate this game so low but hey, If I avoid a game because I don't enjoy playing it then I need to be honest with myself and rate it for what I think. I give this game a 6.

EDIT: 11/17/2012; I recently was re-introduced to RftG again and with some gentle guidance I can safely say that this is now one of my favorite games. Bumped my rating up to a 9.

RATING: 9
Our "gateway" game (ie, the game that got my wife and I into boardgames). Still one of our favorites. Lots of interesting decisions, but the play time is not excessive (for us, excessive is >60min); plus it easily fits in our luggage when we go traveling. The main problem we have is that we can't really teach this to anyone. We did get my cousin into it, though. He's been training on the Keldon AI so he plays alright when we get together (once a year or so, since he lives 2500 miles away).

Right now, I enjoy exploring different cards and how they interact, but I have my reservation about how much player interaction it has.  I don't know, maybe it is my luck of experience but it's hard to double guess what other role be chosen and it is completely meaningless for me.  Maybe the role selection may get better as I play more but right now I enjoy role selection of San Juan better.

I also like the simplicity of San Juan, but much prefer 6 buildings in Race with more diversity and added bonus'.  I also like the consume ( shipping) aspect of Race.

So over all I prefer the game that is somewhat in between the two.  Maybe Race with San Juan like role selection might be better for me :)

Good game, except for a fair deal of luck and the necessity to know all the cards in the deck in order to judge how good something is. Little interaction between players; For beginners it's a sufficiently good strategy to just mind your own business. Similar to San Juan in some ways, but more complex.

RATING: 10
This is a fantastic game, probably the most played in our collection, and it plays the handy-dandy role of screening potential gamers. There is a learning curve, and an experienced player can really murder an inexperienced player, which is one of the game's strengths. Things can go 2 ways on a first play:
[b]A)[/b] It excites a new player and they want to jump to the challenge and learn the in ands outs of a challenging game! Woohoo! Obviously these are the people you want to play with.
[b]B)[/b] The write-off gamer complains about the (childishly simple) iconography, poops in the ol' diapers about how badly they lost, and never ever wants to play again. Many spoiled self-entitled gamers want to be able to master a game on their first play, which I would argue is one of the bad side-effects of BGG. "Kids these days" (and yes I'm wagging my boney finger from my rocking chair) spend more time pissing around on BGG and expanding their ridiculous gaming collections than actually enjoying the things they have.

Still sitting on the shelf - Have read the rules a few times and still doesn't make sense :)

It has such great ratings, I have to keep it and give it a chance.

Update - Read the rules again - they're still terrible.  I know if I invested a few minutes on the BGG page (forums/videos) for the game I'd probably have it up and running quickly...  but, there are two many other good games that make sense right out of the box.  Had never rated it before as I didn't think it was fair to do so but now that I've tried again - I think I can safely give it a 4.0 (four for failed)

RATING: 9.2
I finally played this today, and got three games in.  I had read the rules and introduced it to four new players.  Three of them had played San Juan previously.  I have never played San Juan, but I felt pretty comfortable playing Race for the Galaxy after having read the rules twice.  The only person who seemed to have a hard time catching on (after the first game) was the player who had never played San Juan before.  All in all though, I would say this game isn't as difficult to get as some think it is.

I think the game itself is brilliant.  It is amazingly deep, and I imagine it will take dozens of plays before I have a strong grasp of how to play all the different strategies.  It's a good thing it plays in about 30 minutes :o)  And after you're done with one game, you want to start another.  For new players I think focusing on the military strategy is the easiest route to victory.  It's the easiest to manage, as you're basically just trying to get a strong military in order to play worlds for free, thus scoring large junks of points every settlement phase.  The only other thing you need to take care of is card drawing, but it's secondary.  Once you start to understand the game better, then the production strategies will start to become more clear and prove viable vs. the the simple military method.

This is an outstanding new game and I may raise my rating of 9 higher, depending on further plays.

I wasn't overly impressed with this game.  It may be because I played it with both expansions.  However, the different effects each planet/development give become a little too fiddly for my taste.  It just seems needlessly complex in certain areas.  Like a great game is in there, bogged down by a few too many powers.

I may reevaluate after a few more plays.

I'm not a fan of this game. It's so popular I thought I was sure to love it, but it just didn't do it for me. I didn't like having to try to remember what all the symbols on the cards were and wasn't interested enough to play enough times to get past that. After a few plays I can tell it's a pass for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
A truly superb card-game. It does take a few plays to fathom what's happening, however repeated play unveils greater and greater depth of strategy and complexity. How well you are able to deal with 'bum' hands has a lot to do with how flexible your strategy is and how well you know the cards.

There will of course be those games where your opponent simply pulls the 'perfect' set of cards to execute a particular strategy, but the game is 15 minutes long right? Play another one! Believe me, you'll want to.

I am going to wait to rate this one until I have played a few more times and can start to grasp the strategies. My first game was spent remembering the icons and really just getting a grasp of what the game is like. But I love the sci-fi theme and I am thinking that it will be a big hit once my groups get the hang of the game. 

This game is, like I predicted, a big hit once everyone gets the hang of it. Now that we are starting to grasp how to use production worlds, the games are becoming tight.

My estimation of this game continues to rise as I play. After a first play, I rated it a 6 or 7, but the more I play it the more I like it. My greatest complaint in the beginning was that there was not enough direct competition for my taste, and I missed the tension that comes with that competition. Another multi-player solitaire game, I thought. But I persisted, and began to see how different strategies could be pursued. I decided that RftG is something of a multi-player solitaire - but a very good one! Inspired by Puerto Rico, I can't help but compare it to that game. Race is certainly a more streamlined version of PR, taking the role selection, the goods, and the buildings/crops from that game. I confess that I *really* like the hidden information aspect of Race, though, which is not present in PR. Race for the Galaxy has also cut set-up time and the fiddle factor by using only two kinds of components: cards and VP chips. As a believer in simplicity, I like this!

There is in fact considerable player interaction in this game. It comes in the form of studying your opponent's tableau AND the sequence of phases your opponent has chosen over the past few rounds. Doing these two things will give you some idea of what she will do next, and excelling at the game requires a solid grasp of the opponent's motivations. This element of psychological study and deduction enhances the game considerably. (In PR, players take turns choosing available roles. In Race, players (blind to the others) choose any role they like.) Would I like more direct interaction with other players? Yes. But it's a small gripe. Other downsides: medium-steep learning curve - you will have to play a few throw away games to "get it"; also, I wonder about the viability of multiple strategies. I won't be able to answer my wonderings without more play, though.

Race for the Galaxy blends theme and mechanisms rather beautifully though, and that is an element of game design I both admire and enjoy tremendously. The art is also gorgeous and evocative, and the theming/art brings to mind certain science fiction memes such as Star Wars, Star Trek, David Brin's notion of Uplift, and more. This material is seamlessly integrated into the game in a way that adds atmosphere for science fiction fans, as you can play the "Imperium" and try to subdue Rebel worlds, or try to settle a lot of "Uplift" worlds and focus on Gene goods. The game also plays pretty fast once you grasp how to play, and that's really important to us given our schedule. We can actually get a game in after the kids go to bed, which isn't true of all our favorites.

Update: upgraded to a 9 after many plays. The game improves considerably once players have some familiarity with the deck. The heart of the game's strategy, in my estimation, lies in the role of the 6-cost developments. In Puerto Rico, these are the "big" buildings which give you VP bonuses at the end. Race does a better job of implementing this idea, and I am looking forward to those expansions! I can't wait to have the Uplift strategy, for instance, fleshed out by more cards. Aside: Race does boast some CCG elements, which we really like. But I have noticed that new players can get frustrated by the fact that cards in the tableau affect the game in so many different ways.

I like how the different strategic routes unfold over time in this game, both my awareness of routes to victory and my strategy in any given game. On the whole question of "Is there enough player interaction?": although I LOVE games which are highly confrontational and allow players the opportunity to crap on their neighbors (just look, I rate go a 10!), I find the structuring of a successful tableau in Race for the Galaxy very fulfilling. In many ways, the game really is a race, a race to make sure the game ends when YOU have the most points. The interaction in Race amounts to a psychological estimation of what your opponents are going to do, but the game doesn't strive to be a paragon of interaction. That's okay - this doesn't prevent it from being a fun and outstanding strategy game.

Update: Now rated a 10, well over 100 plays. I am really looking forward to the expansions.

I love the game.  Wife likes it, but not as much at this point.  She prefers Dominion by far for a quick card game.  Part of the problem is I played lots against Keldon's AI and figured out some strategies and she is not quite there yet.  I would love to get more face to face plays in.  Have first 2 expansions and think the first really helps with goals and the few cards it adds allow for more paths.  Solitaire is decent, but I'd rather play Keldon's AI.  2nd is great too, but don't have a desire to add the last really.  Draw deck might get a little to big.

Don't record plays against AI anymore.  Probably recorded a handful of them at the start, but most are face to face.

Played a few times - I just didn't see this as a great game.  Felt like a form of San Juan in space, but would rather just play San Juan.

The guessing game of role selection favors the experienced player and I just don't want to spend more time playing this game to become experienced.  

There are many complex rules and each card has it's own special ability (which is fine in most cases) but unless you're familiar with each special ability you spend a lot of time staring at your cards blankly thinking "WTF should I do here" while experienced opponents blast through.

Lowered from 3 to show I would rather play this than chess, but would rather play anything 3 and higher than this.

Less than two months or something on the market and this game is already ranked #39 as the greatest game EVER on Boardgamegeek!  Come on.  Let's get some perspective!  Seven months or so on the market and now it's #11!

I'm told that the game is quite similar to the game San Juan which is the card game version of Puerto Rico -- what will permanently be the #1 game on Boardgamegeek unless several people eventually re-rate the game.  I've never played Puerto Rico, and I've never played Magic.

It seemed difficult for me to learn the game whether it was one o'clock in the morning or not.  I liked the space theme, but it certainly seems to violate the Joe Steadman rule of "Where's the conflict?"  The game could use some Mag-Blast type warfare...

I played it again.  I don't think this one is going to be a favorite unless I devote a lot of time to it.  That's the same problem I with Tigris & Euphrates, but this one has several different cards to unravel.  

I think this is a game that you need to learn in the two-player version.  I'm usually not a fan of playing multi-player games with two players, but I think that is probably the best way to learn this one, unless a player is very comfortable with a game like San Juan or Magic.  However, I'm not a big fan of cards with lots of little symbols with different numbers and colors...

Magas szinten kidolgozott, sci-fi kártyajáték. Elsőre kicsit bonyolultnak tűnő ikonrendszere pár játék után a kártyák nagyon jól megvalósított jelzésein keresztül könnyedén megtanulható, izgalmas játékmenetet biztosító játék. Alapvetően két fajta stratégia van a nyeréshez. Vagy bolygókat hódítunk meg vagy termelő bolygókon az anyagokból szerzett pontokkal nyerjük a játékot. Persze e kettő út kombinálható is. Igaz, hogy az akcióválasztáson kívül nincs interakció a játékosok közt, de talán nem is szükséges minden játékhoz. Az akcióválasztás a Puerto Ricóból már ismert valaki választja és mindenki egymás után végrehajtja, csak a választó kap még hozzá némi bónuszt is.

It felt alien at first due to the fact that each player basically holds two hands. The use of utilitarian symbols to show card abilities is unique. After the first half game it all starts to click and you wonder why you didn't "get it" right away. 

I still need to play another set before a final verdict.

I don't know... it's not that I underestimate the depth or don't understand why people like this, but so far this game just makes me feel "indifferent." As someone who likes to get really into my games that's basically the kiss of death for me. I doubt the motivation is there for me to want to really learn it and play into it

Personal biases (along with sleep deprivation) probably  negatively impacted my first play of this too... after hearing so much about it's "multiplayer solitaire" gameplay this was never really a game on my radar and so I didn't really go into it with the same open mind that I give to most games I've never played.

After playing it, the claims of multiplayer solitaire are overstated -- you DO play the other players at the table, because you set yourself up to leech off of their expected actions to fuel your combos. Reminds me of the video game "Puzzle Fighter" in that regard. I love double-blind selection and the intense mind games it introduces when all players understand a game, so that aspect of the game is appreciated.

But that form of interaction, alone, is not strong enough here for me to consider this an interactive game... at least not enough of the type of interaction that I crave.

Ultimately the game doesn't seem like it's for me, because other than the double-blind mind games I really don't think I care for the other aspects of the gameplay at all -- draw a bunch of cards to enable you to put into play a combo that will win you the game, basically. Is there more? Probably -- I've only played once!

Brilliant game with a long development period that shows in its quality.  Beautiful iconography helps give the game a distinctive feel and allows for quick, efficient play after the initial learning curve.  Random deck offers some amount of chance but rewards players for their adaptability.  Lots of options give the game strong variability between plays, especially with expansions.  Undoubtedly one of my favorites.

Slightly above average game (I'm a bit biased upwards since I like deck builders).  I can't really pin what I don't like about it but I don't enjoy the game.  Played through twice and finished well both times.  May enjoy with more plays as my group really likes this game.

RATING: 10
Race for the Galaxy is a extremely elegant, hand-management game. The cards represent everything from settled planets to manufactured resources, and even serve as the currency. Multi-use cards are one of my favorite mechanisms and this game really forces players to decide how best to use the cards they have. The action selection mechanism is also quite ingenious as it allows everyone to piggy-back on someone else's choice with a reduced effect. An intuitive player can maximize the actions of other players to pull off some impressive combinations. I enjoy the game best with two players using the advanced rules, as it makes for some very thrilling races that are over in 15-20 minutes. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Of all the games I've ever tried, "Race For the Galaxy" (plus expansions) is my all-time favourite. It is clever, modular, satisfying, quick, with countless ways to win, almost zero downtime - and it looks gorgeous.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I would really like to give this a better rating, but I have two very distinct problems with the game.  

One, The learning curve is tough (especially trying to wrap your head around all those icons), this I can get over.  

Two, There is virtually no player interaction other than trying to gauge what other actions players are going to select.  I won't deny that trying to figure out their move and plan for it isn't actually a big part in the game, but man there really isn't anything else going on between players. Normally the multiplayer solitaire would knock this game down to a 6 for my tastes, but the engine building is so intriguing here that I just want to play it again and again.  I'm really hoping that there will be more interaction in the expansions.

It's a pretty fantastic puzzle.

FYI, I like this much more than San Juan.

UPDATE: The more I play this game, the more that I understand how to take advantage of other people's strategies - banking on other players actions, that I expect that they will take.  This game is great.  My only issue after multiple plays is that the Uplift is tough to do anything with, and the Military strategy is too draw dependent.  The expansion massages both of these issues.

Race is a great card game, and is really good to play with either 2 or 4 - I have the first expansion but am yet to play with it, I hear it improves the game a lot, but can't really comment! We have played Race a few times, and I really enjoy the gameplay, and the strategic aspects - I am slowly getting the hang of some strategies, and think that as I play more and get the hang of it more, this could progress to being one of my favourite games

I was intimidated by Race for my first 3 or 4 plays.  Only now do I feel like I understand the cards enough to adopt a strategy.  This game feels like it has tremendous staying power.  The only thing I don't like is playing this game with true simultaneous action.  If you play that way, then you are truly playing multi-player solitaire, and you have to trust each player to interpret all rules 100% correctly.  I much prefer to play a "moderated" game where each player processes their action by announcing what they are doing in turn.  This only slightly lengthens the game, but vastly improves the social investment and game experience in my opinion.

I've played it a whole lot now.  At first I loved it, and then I just liked it.  I think the the bit that soured me slightly on it that eventually cropped up is that it really is a race.  If you treated as a civilization building game or a deep strategic game, you will lose.  The goal is to win fast, not build lots of stuff and get lots of points.  It's the card game equivalent of a real-time strategy "twitch" game.

Better than San Juan, but vastly overrated. Very luck-driven, so that most of the time, among players of like experience, the result is determined more by the cards than by anything else. Each expansion adds both niftiness and luck; I advise adding them one at a time.

Occasionally a 2p game will be close and exciting. Most of the time, though, the winner is clear after the second or third turn. After that, the loser is just playing to be polite. The game would be much improved by the use of a doubling cube or similar convention.

Race for the Galaxy is by far my favorite game. You don't necessarily need to be a space junkie to enjoy this game. The game is built around a turn structure where players choose what action they want to take. Whatever any players choose will determine what turns will occur that round. Not every turn will occur each round. Players receive a bonus for whatever card they choose. It makes it interesting when trying to predict what cards other players will choose. The cards work beautifully together, but this game can be a little intimidating to a novice gamer. Save this for some saltier dogs.

My first 10. I thought it would be a 10 from the first time I played it, and I've finally upgraded it to a 10 after my 13th play. This game offers so much depth, so many different ways to strategize. Reading your opponents and guessing what they'll pick is vital, and you can piggyback off that nicely. I love this game every time I play it, whether it's stand-alone or solo with the expansion. I just can't get enough of it.

Edit 17.09.16: Still the best game ever, after probably over 200 plays. So many games on the app vs the Keldon AI (probably 7 per week since it came out) and on boardgamearena. Always great.

An excellent strategic card game... I think the action mechanics and use of the cards as currency is extremely inspired. The space theme fits this very well, and can be something of a brain-burner at times (which I like). It's rather fulfilling to set up a good economic engine, then just watch that engine go to town. Games are quick too, allowing multiple plays in one session to try out different strategies. Lots of complaints about the iconography (and I admit, I was intimidated at first), but they became pretty intuitive after just a couple of plays. My one complaint is that iconography makes it hard to bring non-gamers into the fold. Overall, I'll be enjoying this one for a long time.

extremely re-playable; a game that probably needs to be played a lot to fully appreciate; arcs give different game-play experiences while sharing mechanisms; wonderful tableau building experience in a short time; Race is a game I grew to love...

I think it's better than San Juan, has longer playability, but still has limited playability. It feels like there is a best strategy for each world and if you get the right cards you will win. Sounds bad, but I haven't played it enough to get to that point and still want to play it more.

Tom Lehman has outdone himself with a wonderful alternative to a great game paradigm.

Have played this game more than any other. Actually, I have kind of burnt out on it - but only briefy! I like playing this even more than its venerable ancestor, Puerto Rico. Part of the reason it makes it to the table so much is that it packs such an enormous amount of quality gaming into such a short time frame. It is chock full of tactical considerations, very difficult choices, strategy, the right amount of luck (for a shortish card game), a fun production engine, outguessing your opponent, etc. etc. Yes, the iconology seems impenetrable at first, and impossible for casual gamers - but not true! I taught this game to my very reluctant girlfriend (reluctant to learn Race, not reluctant to be my girlfriend, that is...) and now she begs me to play it! Its just one of those games that every single gamer should learn and try out - the only critisism some may have is that the luck level is too high, and you either get the card you need to win, or you don't. I personally do not like high luck games very much, but I have to say that there is so much in this game to mitigate the luck factor. Most gamers who find the luck too annoying may have just not played enough to unravel all the complexity yet.

I liked San Juan when it came out, and I've had a great time playing it.  This version of it has just failed to seize my imagination in any way.  I am not very good at it precisely because I remain steadfastly incurious to figure out how to game it.  Obviously, this is not the fault of the game, but is the result of a mixture of my prior gaming experiences and my current obsessions that leave this game out in the cold.  A third wheel.  Last night's sushi.  My ex-girlfriend.  Something in the way of something that I'd rather be playing.

Still, my friends like it, so I'll play without complaint.  They'll tire of it soon, I hope.

Steep learning curve, but a whole lot of fun once you figure it out! Recently, its lost a bit of appeal for me. Since there are only 5 start worlds, strategy feels a bit limited, and I find myself taking the same route oftentimes. Its hard to bring myself to buy an expansion for a game Ive stopped enjoying.. It could pump life into it, or be a waste of 20 bucks... I would rather invest in games I know I enjoy since we cant afford a gamble!

This is a fantastic game! If you want a quick playing game with loads of strategy, this is it! (How rare of a combination is that?) Plus it takes hundreds of plays to really plumb the depth of it. So go buy it right now!

And don't be scared off by the icons: after you've played the game once or twice, the icons will all be clear to you. And you'll find them much quicker to read than text ever could be.

(When introducing new players, I've found it helpful to cover some rudiments of strategy: military strategy, development strategy, produce-consume strategy, trade-trade-trade strategy. And be sure that new players play a full game in less than 45 minutes: more games = more fun. It's not worth trying to optimize play your first several games--just enjoy the experience of exploring this new universe.)

After playing it a few times, I still don't fully a) understand all the symbols, b) know all the rules properly (even when reminded, I still have a 'Huh?

I'm still willing to give this more of a chance, but I'm beginning to think that this game is just not for me.

Занимательная карточная игра, по своей механике напоминающая Пуэрто-Рико и немного Цитадели: игроки выбирают себе роли в каждом раунде, которые применяются ко всем игрокам, но выбравшему дают бонус, таким образом зарабатываются победные очки и выкладываются карты своего кусочка космического пространства: планеты, улучшения, миры и т. п.. По сути - это красивый вдумчивый пасьянс с очень небольшим взаимодействием игроков. Чтобы выигрывать, надо "прощупать" несколько стратегий и найти свои. Игра занимает около получаса, правила просты в освоении, а механика предоставляет множество вариантов.

I know that people love this game, but it's another card game where you build up your system using several cards with lots of writing on them.  Difficult learning curve and it seemed to me to be a bunch of people playing solitaire at the same time.  I'm sure that there is some depth, which is why people like it, but to me, there are better games out there that also include some good player interaction.

UPDATE: It certainly has grown a little bit on me, but it's just not something that I enjoy and would like to seek out.  I think that the card synergy just doesn't really grab me in this game.

UPDATE #2: Being surrounded by so many fans of the game, I keep having to play it.  It's grown on me, and the iconography and learning curve is finally past me.  I still think it's a little too solitairish to get much higher than this, but it does have some great depth.

UPDATE #3: Continue to like it more and more. Lots of great decisions in such a little package and over such a short duration.

UPDATE #4: Well, I've come full circle on this, and it simply is one of my favorite games now. I enjoy having to think what's going on with my opponent, and the challenge is in getting your engine going quickly, as the game really does move quickly, especially with 2.

We tend to play with the expansions mixed in for the extra cards, but don't really play any extra rules (like goals)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The weight of expansions has caused this rating to sink a little bit, just because the setup/teardown time is getting longer. But still a great game for depth of strategy. Intimidating to new players due to the vast number of symbols.

I'll never be a fan of the sterile space theme, but I'm warming up to the abstraction behind it. Race for the Galaxy is both hard to learn and worth the investment as it becomes more interactive and more enjoyable with more plays. There are many paths to victory, but you have to use your brain even after you've settled on which one to take. It's San Juan's deeper, more mature counterpart. I have to say, though, that I prefer Glory to Rome in the engine-building genre. Race is a lot tamer by comparison.

RATING: 10
The learning curve is fairly steep for first-timers, but is well worth it. I have well over 100 plays by now, and I feel like I'm still figuring out new strategies to try. Race is an incredibly deep game for how quickly it plays.

RATING: 10
Tremendous replayability. My wife wasn't impressed after 1 play but a second play helped a change of mind. No direct interaction and multiple winning strategies tick the right boxes for us. The numerous unique cards give stategic depth that varies on every play. Card holders also come in handy. As a bonus, the game travels easily and BGG user solo variants work well. Still fun after thousands of plays with Keldons AI and a few on-line.

RATING: 9
Similar to SJ but adds complexity (more options, more cards, more interactions) and a better theme (and very nice artwork) while INCREASING game speed (simultaneous role selection). Especially good as a 2-player game: each person chooses 2 roles (so the game plays faster), and it's easier to keep track of what the other person is doing. The iconography is tough, at first: there are a LOT of icons. But they do a remarkably good job of summarizing the relevant rules for every card.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
For new players, choices are not obvious and you usually end up not being as efficient with your actions. With a few plays you see how your endgame is set up by your early game choices. After this, this game is excellent. Every choice is levied out especially when there are 5 players due to the increased amounts of discards. If not for how seemingly difficult it is for some to pick it up I would rank this higher.

RATING: 10
When I first bought the game, it was due to 2 reasons. It was highly portable and it had a great theme of creating your own galaxy. Far far away... or maybe not.

When I started playing, I thought it depends on what you draw so much that you have to be lucky. Since then I played tons of games and bought The gathering storm expansion. And it's not that much luck dependent at all, it's a lot of strategy. Knowing the possible cards in the deck doesn't hurt, but I have a very very very bad memory, so that's not an option. Still I know roughly what is in the deck and now... wow... when I play with my friend who is into strategic games (purely strategic), we're having a blast. Usually the games end really close, there's no huge gap between us. And he's starting to outplay me which makes me want to play even more to refine my strategy.

There is luck present in the game, but once you figure out some advanced strategies for the game, you beat new players without much effort even if they're "lucky" in the card draws. And knowing your oponent brings another level of strategy, trying to guess what they'll do so you can take advantage of their actions during your turn (like betting on them playing certain action that you need so that you can play other actions that even more boost your position). On the other hand your oponent is probably doing the same thing.

Really enjoy this one, it's an awesome game. And the theme is just great adition to already great experience.

RATING: 10
There is tremendous variety in this game.  Even the basic starting hands have a few different openings.  The phase system is clever and the 2-player game works well too.  Also it packs a lot of game into a relatively short playing time, and nicely evokes the theme, whether you are building a military powerhouse, a merchant empire, or a technologically advanced civilization.

Race for the galaxy kicks galactic ass! I can think of no better way to describe it. But I'll try....in race for the galaxy you kick ass and win, or you don't kick ass and you lose. Pretty simple right? Wrong! You think exploring and settling new worlds is easy? You think developing technologies on a universal scale and brokering alien goods is some kind of silly game? Well its not! Well, i mean it IS  a game, but its not silly! Nor is it easy, but it is a whole lot of fun.There is a ton of stuff going on in this game, and it can be a galactic pain in the ass to teach, but once you understand it the game plays quick and easy.

It took me a while to get my head around this game.  It wasn't until I watched a couple of online tutorials that I grasped the concept.  Now I'm really enjoying RFTG.  Just added two expansions and getting a lot more mileage playing with the solo rules in the first expansion.

Didn't particularly like at first, but have warmed up to it.  I always loved the theme and the art, but all the icons are a little too fiddly for most of the people I play with.

Played twice and understood better the second time.  Feels like a CCG and, while I'm largely unfamiliar with that genre, Race has a lot of promise.  I need to play once or twice more to really dig deep enough to give it a rating.  Update: I'm beginning to think  Race is a bit too busy.  Even after learning the rules, it takes a few games to really wrap your head around it.  Along those same lines, the gameplay isn't as streamlined as the best games.  Perhaps it would rate higher with me if it was stripped down just a bit.  I generally like CCG style games, but Race is too confusing.  I still only half understand what's going on.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This game was daunting at first because of all the symbols but once you know what they do and play through a few games they're all pretty easy to understand and you can get through games pretty quickly.  I like the mechanic of choosing which phases are played out and getting a bonus for your chosen phase a la Puerto Rico.  My favorite change from the Puerto Rico formula though is that all phases are chosen and played concurrently instead of each player picking in an order and being the only person who can pick that role/phase so you're not stuck in a position where your board stagnates because other players are locking you out of necessary bonuses and lines of play you need all because of bad board position.

I still love this game but Roll for the Galaxy has completely replaced it.  I like Roll just a little bit more and I don't see the need to keep both.

OOoh, I like it. After not being a big fan of "Puerto Rico" and thinking "San Juan" was not much better than nice I am really surprised by how much I am enraptured by "RftG" since the basic mechanics in all 3 games are similar. For my tastes, they seem to be best executed here I guess. I usually like card games and I like how you have more control by choosing the action card from your own deck as opposed to choose from what is left in the open supply. It actually plays rather fast so you can easily play several times in a row (which we did) which is a help to really get into the game since there are a lot of symbols to take in when you learn it first (and don't always want to check the cheat sheet). Like it a lot, eager to play more, but yeah, it is a bit tough to learn when it hits you the first time.

Pretty decent game. Has something of a learning curve but it's not that bad at all. I feel like the play time is a bit exaggerated and it's pretty easy to get a game in within a half hour. Definitely not a complex game but I can see why people don't like the symbology. The individual player aids help with that though.

Issues I have with the game:
1. Feels like multiplayer solitaire - prefer more direct interaction. Little incentive to keep a close eye on opponent's cards.
2. Comes across too short for a game of such depth - feel unsatisfied at the end of each game.
3. Steep learning curve - tough to get casual players into the game and for them to be even somewhat competitive.
4. Once familiar with the general strategies, card draw seems to be a key factor to success amongst seasoned players. I like a degree of luck in the game but at times this comes across overly random.
5. Playing according to cards obtained sometimes lead to mechanical choices (e.g. Consume - 2x VP / Produce in a 2-player game).

OMG. Love this one. This could seriously become my fave card game. After Liz played a few too, she's giving it some love, unexpectedly! She even uttered the words "Better than San Juan"!! Wowzers!

Expansions - particularly TGS with the robot - are good, though the latter 2 (unplayed as yet) do seem to make things more fiddly?

Hoping the love continues...

EDIT: last comment was 2010 - now 5 years later, love still continues. Still enjoy this, and enjoying "Roll for... " as well.

Race for the Galaxy is a hugely popular sci/fi-themed hybrid of a card game and an action selection game in which all players can utilize all actions chosen by the other players and vice versa. As such, it is a game that is quick to play at the same time as it provides the players with a ton of considerations to keep in mind when choosing their action. While wanting to maximize one's own efficiency by utilizing other player(s) action choice(s), one must also make sure not to provide other players with the actions they want to use the most. Sadly, the game is hugely determined by the players luck of the draw, which in this kind of game limits the potential fun factor a lot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Although similar to San Juan, they don't necessarily appeal to the same people.  SJ is a lighter game, easier to pick up and play casually.  RftG is meatier, requires more focus, and is probably harder to play just once every couple of months, which is how I enjoy San Juan.  It's quicker and more balanced than Glory to Rome, though I like the latter more.

I'm obsessed with this game. It's like San Juan, but better. The simultaneous play helps it move along quickly, and the use of cards as goods instead of separate pieces (a la San Juan) means that setup is a breeze and there's not a bunch of little pieces to lose. I'm not really sure why I like this so much, but I do. It's hard to make sense of at first, as there are a lot of rules and details to consider, but it's well worth sticking it out through the first two games. After all, the games are pretty quick.

So wanted to love this game.  Beautiful artwork, my second favorite mechanic at its core (variable role selection), and my favorite theme (science fiction).  So much to like!  Then it got here.  Null interaction and complex abilities defined by very slight variances in color shade (I'm color blind; having to show my wife my cards and ask "What the hell color is that?!" ruins the element of surprise) .  Update: got it again, marked the deck and viola!  great game!

A very quick-playing, but extremely deep and complex game.  I love Race for the Galaxy because it seems like Puerto Rico distilled down to a pure form that both moves along at a good clip and introduces some well thought out randomness that ensures the game does not become easily solved.  The only problem I found with the game is that it is very complex to teach others how to play effectively.  Most people I tried to play with gave up because I always won since I know how to play and have read the rules while they are still trying to figure out what the symbols mean and how the cards interact.  This meant I eventually ended up with nobody to play against.  I couldn't convince anyone else to try reading the rules first to see if that helps, either.

UPDATE:  After a few more plays, I now loathe this game.  I just can't get past how uninteresting it is once you learn how to play it effectively enough.  No thanks.

This is easily the best game of 2007 and one of the best games of the last five years. Race for the Galaxy packs an amazing amount of variability in a very short playing time. The large number of unique cards make lots of different strategies possible. One of the most replayable card games, only beaten by Tichu and possibly the Settlers card game in that respect.

Second copy for trade.  Used in good condition. Some minor shelf wear on the box and the cards were never bent to shuffle, always overhand.

My wife's favorite game.  I love how much you can do in this game.  There are so many great strategies, and the simultaneous action choosing is a lot of fun.  Highly recommended though the initial learning curve is a little high, just get though it and you will thank yourself.

Easily my favorite first play of any game so far.  Might be nice with some more player interaction; the lack thereof is the only reason I didn't rate this a 10.  Otherwise, I truly enjoyed this game.  Edit: 1st expansion added a small amount of competition, not really interaction.  2nd expansion promises a bit more, haven't played it yet.

Based on some large number of games against Keldon's AI -- keldon.net/rtfg/ -- I'm now liking the game quite a bit. 

That said, I like it on the PC, where I don't have to deal with the fiddly bookkeeping or new players or AP. Even under those blessed conditions there's more luck to it than I'd prefer. 

I'd buy it but I don't think it would see the table.

RATING: 10
The learning curve is quite steep due to all the symbols you need to memorize, but once you're there, the game is a blast. It's pretty quick and portable for a game this deep. I strongly recommend the "RftG for Kids" manual to learn the game (in the files page of the game here at BGG). Caveat: not a lot of player interaction

EDIT 2018/01/11: After being hesitant for a long time, finally went for the full package and added in BoW with all rules. I still think takeovers are a little meh, but the're not very frequent so they don't usually get in the way; and prestige is much more interesting than I thought, and not so complicated as it seems. Also, we have kind of a regular group now, so I went from "very good game" to "I love love LOVE this game".

Expansions: The Gathering Storm, Rebel vs. Imperium, Brink of War.

Played it for the first time in 2008 and fell in love with this gem. I finally purchased my own copy recently and I'm still fascinated by the depth, quick play, and re-playability. This will probably never leave my collection.....until I get to play Roll for the Galaxy perhaps...

This is the first game that I've played over 100 times in my modern board game playing era.  And while the rate of play has slowed down a bit, I see playing this game at least 40-50 times a year.

The key right now is that I still want to play it. I’m not tired of it. The expansions have helped with the new cards and new ways to play the game.

After almost two years, I still can't get enough of this game.

What can I say?  I really like this game.  The theme is great, the cards are great.  I will agree with most that the game does kind of feel like a solo strategy game, but there's a lot of subtlety that I feel comes out the more you play it.  It's like a competitive solo strategy game, and I think it's just great fun.  All our games come really, really close.  There IS a great deal of luck in what kinds of cards you get, but theres also a lot of strategy in how you choose to sort of plan out your galaxy.  I don't know, it might not be for everyone, but my friends like it a lot, and so do I.  Can't wait to try the expansions!

RATING: 10
A very deep, complex, tactical and strategical science-fiction card game.

The complexity and depth makes it hard to learn but that's also one of it's advantages. It's worth getting engaged into it. 

The theme fits very well, the design is also ok, although some pictures are too dull. Regardless, it still has a very good atmosphere and science-fiction fans will definitely like it. I have no problem with the icons whatsoever.

Again an oversized box. The game could easily fit a box third this size. I guess it might be too big even for all three expansions.

I did not log plays with Keldon's AI

Fun little card game, but if you're new to the game, make sure you have someone who knows what they are doing teach it.  It's complex, and the rule book does little to help that.  After it "clicked" we enjoyed it, and are glad it is in the collection.

- Multiplayer solitaire
- Sometimes u can get very lucky/unlucky (fixed with house rules)

21/02/2011: After some hundred plays with the PC version (not counted in BGG as plays) rank goes to 9.5 from 9.
Can't stop playing!

15/11/2011: I bought all 3 expansion and i slowly add them to the base game. I am currently using the first two expansions and the game is still awesome. After some plays i will add the final expansion in the mix.

28/05/2012: Added the third expansion and it seems very interesting. Gameplay seems to be changed a lot with prestige.

16/04/2015: Played after some time and fell in love again. Increase rating to 10. It is very rare to feel so good about a game.
I feel like starting again with the base game and relive the experience of slowly adding the expansions. I still haven't played enough of the draft variant, nor the Alien Artifacts Arc.

Design masterpiece. Of course, it has flaws: too much solitaire, not enough interaction, too similar to collectible card games, but in general it is very addictive and gameplay is very pleasurable. Fast setup is also a merit.

RATING: 8
[RGG 07 edition] {Galaxy; simultaneous-action, hand management; scalable} Race for the Galaxy is an original game for its phase selection mechanic.  The game flow is intuitive enough to learn it easily even though it takes some times to understand the cards and icons.  I don't think it's a multi-solitaire game; one must lose even if he doesn't pay attention on what other players are doing.  It has multifaceted strategies.  Early game plan is quite important and decisions are somewhat constrained with early card draws; thus, getting more cards at early game is quite important.  The playing time, 45 mins per game, is very good - it's never boring.  The point that prevents me from rating it higher is the lacks of theme - players just too focus on reading the symbols, not the cards.  I enjoy each game quite much.

The components are so-so: standard MtG card size with moderately thick cardstock.  The illustration is typical CCG style.  I wish the VP chips were larger.  The player aid is handy.  However, the box is horribly large than necessary.  In addition, they should provide goods marker, rather than using the playing cards.  Using playing goods just senselessly increase the luck of the game.

I waver on race.  It's a really decent resource-machine-building game, but there are some niggling problems with it that keep it from being any sort of sworn-by-favorite for me.  

First and foremost--and I'm aware of the few vehement fans who will chomp at the bit regarding this statement--there is not much interaction in RftG.  Let's go ahead and compare it to San Juan, since such a comparison is inevitable; the role-drafting in SJ gives enough interaction that I can't effectively play the whole game with my eyes solely on my own cards.  With RftG, I can certainly benefit from looking at my competitors' setups, both to attempt to mind-read what phase they will play and also to know what cards to keep from them.   But in the end, I can do a decent job solely from staring at my own setup--in my group, I generally do just this, since the game goes by too quickly for me to pick up everyone's cards and examine them to understand what they're doing.

Which leads to the second and third problems: the vast variety of cards that are too hard to distinguish for a casual player, and the iconography.  The latter is actually sort of enjoyable for me, but poses such a large learning barrier for new players that it makes RftG much less of a game I'd introduce to people than San Juan, where all the cards say clearly what they do.  The former is a particular problem for me; I've played RftG over a dozen times, but only know what a handful of worlds and buildings do by name.  San Juan only has a couple dozen buildings, and I could tell you what most of them do off the top of my head, and I've only played SJ one more time than RftG.  This makes it so other players can't just announce "I built New Epsilon" and I will immediately know what they're doing.  Supposedly the iconography should help with this, but I find that realistically, it's too much trouble to figure out what my opponents are doing except in a two player game.

All that said, RftG is enjoyable.  I particularly think it's a good, 15-20 minute 2-player game, since you have more control over phases in this game and can pay more attention to your opponent.  I think if I played RftG several dozen times and was intimately familiar with all the cards, I'd find it's a much more interactive game, but I find that necessary time-investment a bit of a minus.  I'm hoping that the Gathering Storm expansion, with its ability to aggress on opponents, will help with this problem without making the military strategy too powerful.  We'll see.

In the end, RftG is a decent game, but I prefer San Juan and since I own the latter, I don't have a great drive to get Race. 

COLORBLINDNESS NOTE: I personally find the Rare Element-brown and the Gene Element-green quite hard to distinguish, especially their windfalls.

ADDITIONAL NOTE ADDED AFTER ORIGINAL COMMENT: Oh god why can't I stop playing?

RATING: 10
Lot of richness and replay value. You need some plays to learn the cards, and then more plays to discover the various strategies. Bonus : the card names and the artwork is great if you like the sci-fi references (books and movies).
Note: first time that I see two sci-fi writers' names in the thanks' section of a game ruleset!

Update : rating upgraded to 10, after one year of playing. The Draft variant found in the Gathering of Storm expansion is a great addition for the people who played the game a lot.

RATING: 6
Pretty cool for the first five plays, and really is much less complex than it seems.  Certainly as good or better then San juan,  but not a top notch game like T&E or PR, or PG.  Also the fun can be completely sapped out of this game by slow players, who seem to think it's bad the pay for a card they need, with another "good" card.  The recycle rate of this game is much lower than San Juan,  so it isn't really all that important to be selective int he card you sue to build others.

This game has a very steep learning curve, and the symbols on the cards are not as intuitive as I would like. It takes about 3 play-throughs before you get the hang of it and can really begin to develop strategy. It's a great game if you can get that far.

Also in the same box: The Gathering Storm
I think this expansion adds a lot: extra player, bonus goals, extra cards, drafting rules etc. The solitaire option is also well done, and difficult! Some expansions don't seem to add much to a game, but I really like this one.

Interesting game with numerous strategic approaches. Not sure what is more satisfying - the big card VP military strategy, or the production machine that churns out VP counters every go.
Added - now only play this with both expansions which makes this the best card game available.
Added again - this, with the expansions and solo play have bumped this up from an 8 to a 9. I could almost...almost make this a 10. We'll see where the next expansions take it. I can see myself having a long term relationship with this game, which is as of 08/09 my most played. I can't see anything overtaking it at this rate either.
Added yet again - got Dominion, London, Glory To Rome and Thunderstone, and play this a lot less... Dominion now has more plays, thanks to BSW.
Update 2014: look, there goes Ascension, whiz zing past in number of plays, and look, here comes Legendary. Just feels a little robotic, and I'm not sure the deck balance isn't a little skewed now. Just don't play it anymore after one disasterous game.

Race for the Door: The I-Spy book of icons (the card game).

Two plays, but probably no more (I've sold my copy).

I just about got over the "WTF does this mean" hump, only to run into the "where do I get to interact with the other players" wall. Maybe my eyes are getting old, but it was hard going trying to read the info on other players' cards from across the table.

[update: tricked (tricked, I tell you!) into playing it again after nearly a year away from it, and a rules reminder, I sort of enjoyed it. Managing [i]my[/i] situation went fine - a little frustrating at first, but I managed to get things together. Little real sense of responding to what other players were doing.]

Note to self: be wary of any game where the largest component is the player aid, and it needs to be double-sided. Such a game is probably not for me.

Great game, but having a small set of planets that can produce and consume can set you up for a quick victory that no one can come back from just by spamming product and consume * 2 VP.

If it was a little more balanced on the whole consume * 2 VP the game would be higher, but it is still a VERY good game.

EDIT: After having played over a few hundred games, I feel that the game is TOO fast if most of the players go a consume produce strategy. I feel that the game needs to have a larger set VP cap. Like 16 per player or something. 

Or better yet, change the Consume * 2 VP to something that can only be used on two or three locations, not EVERY consuming VP location.

Hopefully these issues will be gone with the new Search ability -- giving thematic card sets a chance of being viable against a heavy produce/consume strat.

In 2007 this game would have been/was an 8 or 9.

Do you enjoy rolling lots of custom action selection dice? Then check out Roll for the Galaxy! I recommend trying both versions of the game to see which you enjoy the most. Additionally, many similar games have since been released, which offer comparable alternatives to Race for the Galaxy.

The game's design and scifi artwork are amazing.  It's a hard to teach, but, once players grasp its gameplay, it's an extremely satisfying experience.  No game is alike.  You're rewarded for efficient decision making.  I don't mind the lack of player interaction though it is often criticized for being too much like solitaire.  However, the expansions add player interaction so you can modify the game to suit your preferences on that issue.

RATING: 9
A fun and chaotic card management/resource engine game. Limited player interaction. While the luck factor appears to be large, more often than not the better players win more games. Is it actual depth, or just a matter of familiarity and learning? Regardless, it is very replayable. It's also pretty overpriced for just 100+ cards. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Awesome game.  Many different strategies, highly entertaining.  Dont' be fooled though; it is the dreaded 'multiplayer solitaire'.  You can plan for your opponent's actions occasionally, but not often.  Not a downside for me, but many won't like that.

My god, the symbols.  Let me start by saying I think I'm a pretty smart guy.  I think this game will require hours of play to wrap my head around.  Not sure if I'm just an idiot, or what, but I played this game 1/2 times because I was too lost.  I need to watch a tutorial online.  There are a TON of symbols in this game that will take a while to understand.  DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME WITH A NEWBIE BOARD GAMER.  ***EDIT*** I've watched a tutorial, and have played a half dozen games now.  I still have a lot to learn, but I can see the appeal.  I will be going back to this game again and again.

Only a few plays, but growing on me. Basic strategy is not intuitive though! The learning curve on this game is surprising. The main downside is that a new player will have no chance whatsoever, unless your opponents are brain-dead.

For some reason, it just isn't that much fun, I cannot put my finger on why because I do enjoy card games very much, just not this one.  I played mostly 2 player games with my wife, and there just isn't anything to keep me coming back.  The card art is nice and gives you the feeling of space, the game mechanics are a wonderful adaptation of Puerto Rico, but it just isn't that fun to me.

There's a lot of depth provided by this game and you're confronted with a number of decisions whilst deciding which strategy to pursue. A first it's difficult to know which cards are worth holding on to and which ones to discard but this becomes more apparent with repeated plays and as you understand the possibilities on offer you begin to realize that there's far more depth to the gameplay than you'd expect from a solely card-based game. It's another game I feel that could do with an improved re-write of the rulebook as it's not as clear as it could be, especially when considering that this is actually a pretty simple game to play. A very well designed game though with a lot of replay value. Recommended, especially with the expansion sets.

RATING: 9
Played 10+ times. This is pretty awesome!  It may be a bit more lucky than San Juan because there are more big 6 cost developments and no doubles.  If you get one that works for you on the last turn and can afford it you can get a big point swing.  On the other hand if you get one early and can get it played they usually have good bonuses that help push you towards a cohesive combination of buildings. 
Update: It's definitely more lucky than San Juan because there are more big victory buildings and more combinations so there is a higher chance that you'll get cards that don't work together or won't get the big building you want.  As a result, it feels more tactical and fluid.  Again though, you are in control of the end of the game and you can take actions to overcome a bad hand.  You definitely have to be aware of what other people are doing and how quickly the game may end.

Race for the Galaxy is a tableau building, card game.  You draw and play your cards which represents either developments or worlds.  Each card generally has a cost to play the card, a victory point value and possibly some abilities that help you play or draw cards, or gain victory points.  Once a player has 12 (or more) cards in his tableau, the game ends and the victory points are tallied to determine the winner.

There is generally little direct player interaction.  Generally, the interaction is determining what phase your opponents may be choosing.  The game round has 5 phases.  At the beginning every player secretly chooses which phase will occur in that round.  If no one chooses a particular phase, it does not occur that round.  Part of the strategy is to pick a phase you need and anticipating another player will pick a different phase you also need this round.

The interaction is generally very subtle.  For the most part it is literally a race to get as many victory points as possible by the time someone gets 12 cards in his tableau.  One of the expansions does allow players to attempt to take a card from an opponent, but this ability is rather limited.  Expansions also have mechanics where you compete for victory point prizes called goals.  One one player may get one of these goals and some goals can be taken by other players after one player acquires one.

I really like this game because for the most part, you are gathering pieces to build up your tableau.  Your tableau will ideally enable you to play more expensive cards that net you the most VP's.  For the most part, there is little ability to disrupt another player.  The only thing you really control is how fast you end the game.  Sometimes, you have to try to end the game before someone else can make a big play for huge points.

The game gets a bad reputation for iconography, but I think this is blown way out of proportion.

I have found that my success depends a lot on the cards that I happen to draw.  However, I think this is more of my lack of skill than it is a problem of the game.

I love the simplicity of this system and the game mechanic that determines which phases of the game will be used.   Very fun and simple game.  My only desire is that I wish it would last just a little bit longer.   Might have to house rule the victory points needed to end the game, but that's my only quibble.  I guess that means my complaint is that it plays too fast to get enjoyment out of developing your plateau!  Usually, playing fast is a good thing.

Based on three plays. We were well-prepared having played San Juan a whole lot. Excited about the depth despite simple engine. In order of play, have tried three different ways to lose against my girlfriend: one random build all I can strategy, one production/consume and one military. Icons on cards are not confusing like in 51st State but really helpful - we hardly ever consult the cheat sheet anymore.   

All in all, loving this game! If it hold up another ten plays I'll raise rating for sure. EDIT: raised! :)

I must say I don't really enjoy the game. Like Dominion I find it feels as though I'm just playing by myself.

Very very good game. Post-modernism of card/boardgaming.

Okay, I've played this twice now. The iconography is a mess, the role selection is only okay and it really is not worth my time to 'stick with it' for another 5 or 10 plays until this becomes fun. There is better out there.

Update: Okay, more plays in and this still just happens to me (I think 1 or possibly 2 plays were pre-logging). My fuller thoughts are under the Gathering Storm, but this just doesn't interest me.

I don't like how the role selection system in Race eliminates the core interaction principles of San Juan. 

It's not as simple, elegant, or interactive as San Juan. It's deeper, yes, but that doesn't make it a better game.

After playing a few more games.  As well as two player games.  (It's a great two player game).  I find myself enjoying this more and more.  This one takes a couple of games to get over the symbology shock.

As far as comparing this one to San Juan, they are different games.  But Race for the Galaxy is more Multiplayer Solitaire (and no, I don't consider this a bad thing necessarily) than San Juan is, as there is less player interaction (Sure the role selection can give you a little, but it's not forced like it is in San Juan).

They are both different games, and I like them for different reasons.

Borrowed this game to try it, wasn't sure I'd like a card game. Man was i wrong!

This game is a great 2 player game and we can easily fit two games within an hour. Still the game is complex enough to provide variety and hard decisions. It creates the feeling of creating your own unique space-VP machine. And as all good games it ends just before it gets tedious.

Sure it's a bit of a multiplayer solitaire but that really doesnt bother me. If I want a truly interactive game I'll play something else.

The first teaching of this game was was received with mixed reviews although, in the end I think it was more due to the way I taught the game than for the game itself.  Just be aware that HOW you teach this may be important for those that go off of first impression.

I was more prepared to teach the second time and the teaching went much more smoothly.  I really enjoy the depth I get out of a card game.  Although in my case I think it will replace San Juan in preference, I am not sure the same will be said for my wife, who is my primary other partner for San Juan.

Race for the Galaxy is the best short-duration game that I've played.  It's certainly one of the most addictive games that I've ever played.  The complexity is marvelous for such a basic game.

I've finally learned to like it, which coincided with learning how to play well (relatively). I still think its biggest strength, its time, is also a weakness; it's less about building an engine and growing it and more about racing to have an engine to begin with.

I really love this game, the more I play the more I like it.

- It's perfect for 2 players, but it also works perfectly fine with any other number of people (up to 4 with the base game, 5 with the first expansion and 6 with the first two).

- It's a short game, but it isn't a filler. I mean, you can play it in 30 minutes, but it does involve strategic decisions. Most of the time the one who played better wins.

- It can be played, more or less, in any place. I usually play with my wife in a 3-person sofa, you don't require more space for 2-player games.

- It's relatively easy to explain. I'm really surprised about the reviews saying that the game is complicate! I've explained to different people, both gamers and non-gamers. I play with them two or three turns with open hands, and everybody (even 9 years-old boys) got it! You then show the player reference with the sign summary, and they can play. OK, the first game take longer, since players should read the text in the cards, consult the reference, etc., but they feel they're playing from the first game.

- It can be anything from a light-medium to a medium-heavy game. It depends on the time you need to make a decision. You should always consider the opponents situation before making any decision (if every player only considers his situation, the game becomes a solitaire where the luckiest player wins). However, if you prefer a lighter game, you can play it without "counting the probability of seen a military rebel word if I explore +5 and sell the green good". As long as everybody takes a similar time, the game works.

- It's incredibly replayable. With a hundred of different cards, you'd really need a lot of games to burn it! It's really a masterpiece of playtesting.

- Even though the game is short, you have to change your strategy several times. You're constantly drawing cards, and every one of them would be useful. You have to decide which ones you want to use, which ones you want to save from later and which ones you use to pay.

- Incredible art. The game is really a race. The images brings you in the galaxy.

Rating for the hole series

When you play for the first time it seems complicated, but after few plays you will see all the icons are easy.

At the beginning you try only a "clear strategy" (all brown, or only produce-consume, or anly military) and seek for the 6-dev to your strategy. Then you will see, you strategy mustbe not clear. You must have not many points, you must have more than your opponents. Very important is to control the end of the game. New players are often suprised that the game ends.

The game has a fantastic replaybility. As more you play, you see more connections between the cards. The game is fast (ca. 30 minutes), but you have many choices. 

The cards, are cards and money, so you must choose, what cards you want pla and what will be only money. What action you want to play? You should try to play actions, that gives something only you, and benifit from other players actions.

Early Comment:  Will appeal to the same people San Juan appeals to.  I like it.  But everyone around me likes San Juan too much and want to play it all the time.  I have to keep turning down games because sometimes I like to play something else.  I am worried that Race will go down the same hole in quite a short time.

Additional Comment:  I have now played this over 100 times and yes, those around me keep wanting to play it some more.  However, I think it has considerably more replay value than San Juan and it is good as a 2 player game in the lunch hour.

I went through a phase of finding that it was too much affected by the luck of the card draw, but have now learned to accept gracefully that some hands are just too good or no good.  This happens sufficiently infrequently that it does not break the game.

I find myself fascinated by the way the cards work together to form a sci-fi theme. I enjoyed setting up my 'empire' a lot more than trying to beat someone else's empire, mainly because there seemed little I could do to slow down other players. Just go with a strategy and hope for the best while keeping your options open to take advantage of any good cards that come along. Love the artwork and the card theme, but I suspect that I'll eventually end up with a 'fixed' favourite strategy.

Surprisingly, it feels a lot like Puerto Rico, even more so than San Juan! Your final VPs are scored by adding your 'built' cards and your VP tokens. The game ends when someone 'builds' their 12th card, or when VPs run out. You produce 'goods' and 'ship' them for VPs. You sort of end up with the same strategies, except that you have to rely on cards that are in your hand, instead of on a Common Building Board. And you can't really block someone else who's 'shipping' a lot, simply try to outrun them by building/shipping more. In that respect, I prefer Puerto Rico.

29-Feb-07: It's weird, I can't seem to get this game out of my head. There always seems to be yet another strategy I should try based on the cards that turn up. I just played 4 games of this in a row last night, and I found myself enjoying it. My comment about not being able to slow down opponent stands, but in a way, this is nullified by the way you should try to 'leech' off the actions of other players. I find myself thinking, "Man, if I knew so-and-so was going to Settle, I'd Produce instead, thus getting everything I want to happen in 1 turn instead of 2." I think I'm going to have to get this game now. Upped my rating to 8.

17-Mar-08: Introduced this game to my wife and she loves it. We play with our Carcassonne scoreboard to keep track of the current score, so that we can see how far apart we are in terms of points. We feel it emphasizes the 'race' aspect of the game.

11-Sep-08: 8.0 -> 8.5 One of the few games I'm actually looking forward to picking up the expansion for.

RATING: 6
It's own game, but also what San Juan should have been. Lots of possibilities, and a big enough hand size that you can hold cards for the future without automatically losing.

Maybe too many options. This is a game I think I might like better if I studied it to know the options. But I don't like it enough to study the options. Circular logic, certainly. I doubt the expansion will improve my feeling for the game; the expansion is so late, the time for it being a viable product may have passed.

I've been playing the computer AI version. The base game plays well, but is not that evocative. Put in all the options, and I love the theme. However, the expanded game comes down to who gets the most synergy--luck of the draw. I would be interested to try starting with a 6 point development instead of a planet.

The dice game may be good as it will prevent cards from being unavailable.

I'd really like to see this game go back to being a low luck board game, luck-wise like PR, but I wouldn't want to see a PR clone.

I'm not a fan of card games, but Race for the Galaxy won me over anyway. You can focus on so many different things, but you also have to go with your cards and change your strategy if necessary. Because of all the choices, the game isn't too much about luck.

I love space theme in everything, but in this case the theme is mainly the pictures on the cards. I don't get sucked into the theme at all when playing this. Maybe I would rate it 10, if I did.

You need to play it a couple of times and then a couple more, before you can really appreciate it. First games are a bit confusing and don't seem so great. Play more, it's worth it.

Played about 150 games to date (29 April 08), most of which heads ups. Still just keeps getting better. The best game I have ever laid my hands on.

Lately played a little bit less, but still one of my most popular games with 35 plays in the last 10 months. Nowadays always with the expansion. Still a perfect ten. (13 Feb 09)

With the second expansion, more games lately. Still stays above my 10 bar, as one of the only games I never turn down. (17 Nov 09).

Still going strong, just passed the 250 game post. Absolutely a perfect 10 still. (23 Nov 10).

No reason to drop from 10, although haven't played too much with the 3rd expansion yet. (5 Dec 12).

Flat out is a great game.  Plays in a reasonable amount of time and is highly portable.  Interesting mechanics.  Loses a point for two factors:
1) Randomness of the initial draw can really be a huge help or hinderance, and there's little you can do about it.
2) Icons are sometimes hard to decipher, especially during first few games.  Makes it hard to teach new players.
One of my favorites.

07 APR 2009 - Played @ GameStorm 11 - First game I played at the convention! Was volunteering at the game library and it was slow, so we played this game. I had heard it can be difficult to pick up. You really have to just play it to 'get it' I think. The symbols take some getting used to, but I really like the mechanic of using cards for both the resources and the money and you have to decide which to trash and which to add to your layout. I can see why this game is addicting and so popular. However, I don't see myself playing this a lot right now but will definitely be willing to play again when asked.

RATING: 6.5
In a similar vein as San Juan (cards are used for nearly every purpose, except keeping track of VPs), but better. World and Developments can often influence more than just one action or phase of the game. Actions are also simultaneous and can be the same as other players. The theme is very well done and the card's ability really matches the theme on each card. The cards have great artwork and very high quality. I especially like that this game is short-ish, yet interesting. 

And yet, I rate this well below the norm. Why? Because I can tell whether I'm in or WAY out of the game by the time I've played 4 cards. If you get down by that point, its nearly impossible to recover - making this game pointless... I also discovered Glory to Rome, which I prefer for this style of game.

**2017 Update. I've been playing this a lot on iOS. I'm enjoying it more than I have previously, because I can play a 2-player game in about 5 minutes. Against the hard AI - what I said before still holds true. After about 4 cards played, you have a pretty good idea if you are going to win or not. My rating is holding (BASE GAME ONLY)

An excellent game. Rules are very interesting (although I think they are inspired from Puerto Rico, at least partly).

It has a lot of replayability since there is a lot of cards and strategies.

Not so easy to explain it to people as they get lost with all the symbology. Even if that symbology is very good at all, it's just a lot. So don't expect people not used to card game to get it fast. I would recommend the game fore more experience players.

It's also a game with not so much interaction, at least at a first glance (with experience you have to look at what your opponents do).

I'd say it's the kind of game you learn to appreciate and its value grows as you play (+ tons of expansions !)

This game is quite similar to San Juan, which happens to be one of my favorite games.  I like the theme of San Juan more than the space theme of Race For the Galaxy, but there is a lot that I like about this game as well.  The simultaneous action selection is excellent, and it makes you feel more in control.  You can try to predict what others need to determine what is best for yourself.  There are a lot of cards in this game, so each game plays out quite differently.

There is so much I can say about this game and how much I freaking love it, but I'll try and keep it short. Firstly, super engaging. Secondly, it doesn't fall into the trap that a lot of card games do - randomness with a lack of control. Nope, you can 'explore' to look for more cards, or build your engine to draw even more, the sky is the limit. And the tough decision making brought about by having your own cards as your resources for constructing settlements and developments, wow, what a great mechanic that pushes the play to really think about their actions. Simultaneous play is also nice, and whoa do I like those 'sixers' as we call them (the 6 cost developments that score you specialised points) because they hone you in on a particular strategy.

If I win - she has to rub my feet. YES MY FEET - WITH NO SOCKS! (however I'm "collecting wins" where its one win a day and I hope to get enough for a whole month.)

If she wins - she gets a back massage - 30 minutes a win.

so yeah...she has the most relaxed back in the county with her eight wins. I still have to pay up like another hour and 10 minutes or so. :-/

8/7/2012 Played this against JT.  After all the reading and prepping and finally playing...um...that's it?
Maybe with him winning it had something to do with it.  >_>
will try again someday...hopefully soon and not solo to boot!

I own it, but prefer playing online. Used to be genie, then it was flex, now it is board game arena and I did not enjoy the Keldon AI version as much, it is too good and the network feature does not work for me. I play once in awhile on the 3pm Friday tournament of just the base game. It is a real challenge!
Online systems handle all the details of the powers and makes it easier to compare your situation to your opponents, and provides quality opponents at any time day or night.

In person, I find it complicated to assess other's positions - online I can understand their powers, and know their number of cards, chips left, etc. Also, handling the extra "role" cards is not a great design. I use a modified version of the magnetic selectors.

I have played the base game the most and be competitive in almost any game, even one that looks lost.
I do not love the expansions, but I love one thing especially about them. Before I know any of them really well, there is a joy and excitement in seeing a new crazy card and crazy combo. 

I love games like this, because I can mostly do my own thing, but outguessing my opponent can secure the win. This is also an awesome feature of other favorites including Innovation and Glory to Rome. See the RftG Sommelier review that recommends other similar types of games.

RATING: 8.5
A solid game.  It is a bit Puerto Rico-esk, in that each player chooses a phase and all the players play each chosen phase with the phase bonus going to the player(s) that chose it.  Unlike Puerto Rico, though, you choose your phases in secret and reveal them all at the same time.  This is a cool aspect that adds suspense.  I like that it offers a lot of tough choices and there a lot of paths to victory.  I've played many times now and have not been disappointed and the game has been well received by my gaming group.  Also, the two player game, which has some minor yet impactful rule changes, is excellent.  I probably like the two player game better than the 3-4 player game.  I also like the game length; it plays fairly quickly. Also, the idea of using instructive icons on the cards instead of text seemed a bit odd to me at first but now they seem very intuitive and I prefer them over text on the cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Fantastic game that currently only supports 2-4 players. The expansions will each add another player. Being a card game, RftG has a significant luck factor that I am not sure is mitigable with smart play. However, the game plays quickly, so if you have one bad game, you can always go for a 2nd game or 3rd or ... More enjoyable with more players since more ends up happening each round and the little interaction there is increases slightly.

Race for the Galaxy is as overwrought as San Juan was elegant.  Both are good, but Race goes off the deep-end with complexity.  It's beautiful but the iconography is cryptic, and that belies the bigger problem: almost everything in Race feels like an exception to a principle cited elsewhere. If the whole thing is an exception, what am I really playing here?

This sci-fi game packs a lot of decisions into a small time frame. The base game has strategic pathing, phase timing, and forces you to think about your card flow. I prefer the game with 3 or 4 (as opposed to 2 player). Scoring is tight enough where games are pretty close.

Expansion adds balance to Production Strategies through Goals.
Second Expansion adds more tension and bolsters Exploration.
Third Expansion kinda killed this game for me. Close games are rare now and prestige cards are highly sought after.

It is very difficult to get non-gamers intrested due to the theme and how many rules/icons you have to learn before you play. Once you know the icons/rules everything is a breeze and the game moves very quickly with almost no down time, mostly due to the simulitanous action selection. It's a bit pricey for essentially a deck of cards, but this game does not feel rushed. In fact it really feels very balanced. It also scales great with anywhere from 2-4 players. It's a solid medium weight game and not a gateway game. The only thing lacking is player interaction or a screw your neighbor factor. It is possible to have four people playing and be so intesly into the game, that nobody says a word untill the game ends.

It's interesting how the cards you've played can give your more abilities, which gives your civilisation a distinct feel as you build it.  A big minus is the rule book--probably one of the most difficult to wrap my head around that I've read.  Once you see how the game is played, it's not that difficult.

I'd probably rate this higher if I hadn't played the very similar though lighter San Juan.  Sort of a derivative design.

The esoteric symbols are a failed attempt at minimizing language dependence.  The cards are now equally cryptic to all native tongues.  I've played a few times and I'm still referring to my reference sheet more than I'd like.

The first game where the actual game time is even less then what is said on the box. This game is really fast-moving and quite enjoyable. From the diversity and the possibilities it is very close to Agricola, the gameplay itself comes very close to San Juan. Plus: despite all the different cards and their different advantages and despite all those little icons you have to keep in mind to know when and and what advantages they bring you, this is a very intuitive game. Besides it comes with one of the most stunning artworks I've seen in a game. Normally I'd think that 30 euros is simply too much for a card game, but the art makes it worth every cent. Honestly, this is art. 

This game has gotten me. I am thinking about it all the time with a constant urge of wanting to play it again combined with a strong craving for the expansion.
----------------
Update: While still a remarkable game,I played if often enough (vs.AI) that it's really all about the start hand you get dealt and what to make of it. And there are start hands that are far worse than others, especially if you play against experienced players or a "cruel" AI. Hence the downgrade! Same goes for the expansions

First:
Prefer Puerto Rico. Haven't played too many games.

Update:
A lot faster than Puerto Rico. More interesting decisions. Less scripted. Portable. Does not suffer as much from the bad player chooses the winner a puerto rico can do.

The jewel in my crown. It opened a new world of possibilities. I love the minimalistic mechanics. The very subtle player interaction takes a number of games to sink in. The icon system never really was a problem to me. Played it only a dozen times with a live opponent, and clocked in over 2,000 games against Keldon's AI, 2AP, 3- and 4-player games. Unforgiving and addictive, I just can't stop coming back to it!

Race started out with a bang, but ended with a whimper.  I really loved the game and was able to overlook its flaws--until I played Glory to Rome.  Race is such a static game in spite of its variability.  After several plays, it becomes a bit rote.  And it really can suffer for lack of interaction.  It is a race, but one where most of the contestants run with blinders on.  I would not refuse to play again, but I would much rather play Glory to Rome.

RATING: 5
I love a good deck builder, but have to say I feel this one is wildly over-rated. It has original mechanics, but do they make the game more enjoyable? Sci-Fi shouldn't be a hard theme to capitalize on, but honestly, this game felt very, very dry... Card traits are usually sumarized with what amounts to checkmarks or +1s, making alterations to the basic actions you already take. While there is some connection between this mechanic and theme, it still breaks the game down to boring math... This card increases your ability to buy military cards and gives extra draw (but not keep) in the draw and discard action, this card increases the value of this color of resource created by this planet... The fact that those cards are Military Expedition and Earth's lost colony feel... window-dressing, rather than coloring what you're doing into a narrative. In the end it all breaks down into a big math-pile that doesn't excite before one player locks the other out from winning fairly suddenly. Additionally, one of the core mechanics, resources and their production/exchange/sale, besides being the most math based and bland of them all, is fairly complicated to learn, and even once mastered, it feels like an annoying distraction/blindside Achilles heel you adapt to 
rather than a valid strategy to build towards, and is tediously time consuming and dull from the other players perspective. I suggest finding a different, better title in the same vein, like

So much depth in this one!  I've given up logging my Keldon's AI plays, because I play it almost every day, it seems.  There's an initial learning curve (some people get it really fast, others take a while) and it sucks to be a new player at a table with veterans.  But once you're in, man, it keeps you entertained!
My only real criticism of the game is that some strategies clearly dominate others.  If you're playing Alpha Centauri and draw Mining League and Mining Conglomerate in your opening hand, you're sort of a fool not to pursue a rare element strategy.  But most times you'll have several potentially viable options competing for your attention.  This game is often about making hard choices -- it really is a race, and there isn't time to do everything you'd like to do.

Rating liable to go up or down.  I got a chance to play it in March at the Sacramento Conquest when Tom taught me the game.  I was pretty much totally confused throughout the game -- the symbols, the combos, and what's a windfall again?  Shesh.  But after thinking about our play, and reading the rules, I'm starting to get it.  I did enjoy the game even though I got my Galactic Butt handed to me by Tom -- enough that I've got it on pre-order now.

Race for the Galaxy is another creation of the design that went into San Juan (Tom Lehmann contributed to SJ, but did not get a box credit as he did with RftG).  Tom has had several years to perfect his design and this game shows it.  There are more strategies, more tricks to generate points, and more options each turn (instead of being frozen out of a role as in SJ, a player picks from their hand of action cards every turn).  The result is in many ways a much deeper game--but at a price of being accessible to casual gamers.  Rftg is a "gamers game".  It can take many plays to master the intricacies, and figuring out the icons (even with a player aid) can be maddening at times.  A great design, but one with a few flaws.

For some reason, it didn't quite fit the 'quick game' niche for me.  There's too much going on and people play too quickly for it to be anything but multi player solitaire in my experience.

My rating goes down a point every time I play.

I play online AI and solo against the robot.
When I first got this I dove right in, but then got discouraged with it, found it too hard, etcetera.  Tried to sell, tried to trade, but then finally decided to try "it" again. So I dusted it off and ... I'm glad I did.  I think I'm understanding it, not having as many errors and, most importantly, really having fun!

I was trade bait, but now its a keeper.  For sure.

I want to rate this a 7 but the descriptor for the "6" hits it better.  When I pull it out to play I get pretty obsessive about it and play, like, 10-12 times before I put it away again.  Wait four months. Repeat.

I am going to look into the other solo-able expansions now.

I like that there's a lot of depth, multiple paths to victory, and, if you're playing with experienced players, the gameplay is very fast.

Finally, I like the challenge of adapting your strategy to the cards you have, and (likewise) adjusting said strategy if your followup cards don't cooperate.

This game wins the award for the most unintelligible rules ever written. However, the game is quite intuitive so as long as you can get someone to explain the rules to you (or watch a video explanation like I did) so this isn't too much of a problem. You need to play the game a few times to get a feel for the different strategies and the game becomes more fun as you learn the various cards. Initial rating of 7.

10 plays: I'm reasonably familiar with the game basics now, but I'm not sure I'm enjoying the game any more than before. Stays at 7.
20 plays: Nothing new to add. Remains at 7.

I like playing RFTG, but, it takes a practice game to teach and because of the reliance on icons it can be tricky. Also, as your galaxy grows, it becomes a challenge to make sure you are taking advantage of all your cards in play.

A great game. Sure there can be luck in the cards you draw, but I always find there is some strategy to pursue and ways of mitigating against bad luck. Being able to adapt seems to be the key to this game. I don’t mind the icons on the cards – once learned they are easy to use. The interaction between players is subtle but definitely can’t be ignored.

I am a big fan of SciFi and love the game play of San Juan. This box gives me both and by adding Gathering Storm, I get a great solo game on top. The iconography needs a bit getting used to, but stuff is really visible and understandable at a glance when you play a few games, which helps to have fast game play. So in my book the investment to learn the iconography is well worth it.

I've changed my review on this a few times now, mostly because I don't get it to the table for a long stretch and all the iconography of the game gives it an imposing re-learning curve.  However, with the Gathering Storm expansion that allows me to play it solo, I play this game at least once per week, if not more often.  I think it is just fantastic.  There are two mechanics that I love in games: action/role selection with a follow for other players, and cards as resources.  The marriage of those two in this game is BRILLIANT.  Right now it sits in my Top 10, and might just stay there for a good, long while.

Way too much iconography to be enjoyable with new players, but it's a very fun game with experienced players.

Fast turns even though there's tons of decisions to make each turn. Cards that have a dual function of 'money', the chosen actions of other players, and random card draws make for a continually changing strategy.

I find it much more enjoyable than Roll for the Galaxy.

I'm enjoying this immensely with my wife. A lot of options and plenty of fun choices. I do, however, wish that I wasn't looking forward to the expansion quite as much as I am.

UPDATE after 30 plays: This is getting better and better. I find more viable strategies all of the time. Two days ago I won with 6 cards in my tableau (diversified economy, no 6-developments, alien, gene, and novelty goods (no rare), and a score of 38). At the end I was like, "I can't believe that worked!"

UPDATE after 44 plays: Increased rating to 10. This game really is outstanding. I really do always want to play it. And I really don't expect that to change. Sure there is an investment, sure it's kind of random, sure you might consider it a little pricey, but it's worth it. If I owned 5 games that offered this much of a return on my investment (time learning and money), I wouldn't need to buy another game for the rest of my life (I was born in 1981 so it could be quite a while). The replayability is huge. There are many 'true' paths to victory. Gameplay is deep, fast, and satisfying. And skill is WAY more important than any luck factor in determining the winner.

After 20-some plays, I'm still excited about learning the different combinations and getting to know the deck better.  I hope my enthusiasm doesn't fizzle after that learning process is over.  At this point I really enjoy the game much more than San Juan, as I really appreciate the added complexity and card diversity.

Still playing new strategies on plays 26 and 27 - seems like this one has some staying power!

UPDATE: With about 100 plays of RftG (several are logged under their expansion instead of the base game), I still feel like I'm new to the game.  The people I tend to play with all have much more experience with the game and are more familiar with individual cards and strategies, so I don't win much.  I feel much less certain about what angle to take with certain hands, so it's hard to know when I've played well.  It's still very fun to try to put things together, though.

The Good: A very well-put-together game, with some clever ideas and many different strategies balanced with each other.
The Bad: The cards are filled with icons that are difficult to keep straight -- after at least 6 games, I still have to look things up in the rule book repeatedly.  I picked up Agricola and Caylus with no trouble at all, so I think it means something when I say that THIS is the only one in recent years that has been complex enough to put me off.  This is especially frustrating for a game this short:  You need to have your strategy developed within a few turns, so you can race for the endgame.  And because everyone's cards have a mix of different abilities, it's difficult to keep track of what everyone else has done.  I end up just focusing on my own strategy and hoping that no one else is getting too far ahead (and just trusting that everyone is interpreting their own cards correctly).

I enjoy playing it from time to time, as long as it's not too often.

My wife and I both loved San Juan as our preferred 2p game. I gave this one a try because the mechanics are similar and the theme is more interesting to me. The result is that this immediately usurped San Juan. This is a great game with an amazing amount of depth for being nothing more than cards. The iconography was confusing at first (as it is for many), but after our first game we both felt very comfortable playing. The games are quick enough that we can easily get in 3 games in one sitting.

Possibly the most replayable game ever. It certainly is for me. I've played it hundreds of times face to face. Thousands if I include games against Keldon's wonderful AI.

For a card game with, depending on the number of expansion used, a large number of cards and some proneness to running in streaks I'm always amazed by just how skill based this game really is. And how it rewards repeat play and thoughtful analysis. There seems to be clearly delineated levels of skill in this game. There are folks out there I can beat most of the time, some who I just trade games with and others still who can beat me just about every time out.

It's also amazing just how different this game is at 2 players versus 3 and then again at 4+. 3er is the most challenging, interactive mode requiring that players skillfully anticipate and use their opponents' phase calls to their advantage and deny those they're hoping for.

I've lately been calling it "The Game You Have to Play Twice".  I almost have to play it just to get the desire out of my system.  My core gaming group loved San Juan back when it first came out, but I think we eventually tired it out when we realized there are really only good 2 paths to victory.  Race retains the same fun of San Juan, but feels so much more expanded.  Also, the simultaneous role choosing adds an aspect I really like; having to read your opponents to try to gain the most advantage for yourself.  My favorite move is to play Consume (Trade) when I have no goods out and get someone else to play Settle for my windfall world.  Good times!

Snap judgment: 8.5.  Looks like it has a more complex series of interactions than San Juan.  The military aspect of the game is the strangest to me.  It seems completely abstract, as it does not affect other players in any way you think it might.  Theming is good, and the card art is adequate (in a CG Babylon 5-sort of sci-fi way).  Icon system is confusing at first.

This hits on some of my favorite game mechanics in games.  It reminds me of Citadels and San Juan.  The artwork is absolutely fantastic and draws you into the theme deeply.  The hectic endgame and the tough decision making processes make this compelling and a little addictive.

As far as I'm concerned, totally outdone, replaced, and fired by Glory to Rome.

Race for the Galaxy isn't a bad game, but I would describe it as a needlessly obtuse game. It just strikes me as a more clunky Glory to Rome, set in space. I can play it and quite well, but I never seem to enjoy it as much.

Perhaps it has more depth? I never feel the urge to look and try to find out.

This is a very fun game that may at first glance seem complex but is actually quite easy to get the hang of. There is a solid depth of strategy, but it is accessible and the math doesn't make you feel like you are in a calculus class or anything. A good medium depth/medium time game to play.

RATING: 7
A quick, thematic hand management/engine building game.

The game flows extremelly well and hits a golden middle in complexity/depth. This results in a fun, highly addictive game with minimum downtime. The theme works very well which is a feat really, while the feeling of accomplishment/growth dominates. Simultaneous action selection is perfectly implemented.

Interaction is subtle and rather low, and revolves around taking advantage of your enemies' needs and rushing the game to end. Now this sounds more interesting than it really is, as the game is just barely above the multiplayer solitaire level. In addition your random starting planet defines your available strategies and this is restricting, though thematic. Finally there is some luck in this game, but it is certainly not dominating. The neccessary iconography/complexity makes this a gamers game and difficult to introduce to new players. Not all strategies are equal, some are harder without equal reward.

Despite its flaws I like this game. It's both fun and fast.

RATING: 10
Rating up to 10 with Gathering Storm expansion (I'd probably give it a 9 on its own because it's not quite as balanced without the expansion).  While there is something to be said for the simplicity of San Juan I have, after a number of plays, come to prefer Race for the Galaxy of the two Puerto Rico derived card games.  There is a learning curve for all the iconography, but if you power through the first two games, it becomes a very fast play that is highly addictive.  I think it plays slightly better with 2 or 4 than with 3, but is still great at any number.  

After playing with the Gathering Storm expansion I now consider that to be a critical addition to the game.  It not only provides a great deal more variety in starting worlds but does some crucial balancing of the strategies in the game (mainly by helping others and diluting the blue and brown production strategies that are a bit overpowered in the base game).

Rating by number of players:
2 players:  10
3 players:  9
4 players:  10

This is San Juan on steroids. I am very familiar with San Juan, but even so I struggled at first to work out exactly what was going on in RftG.

I like the engine building of San Juan, but I did not like the lack of card variety in that game. Race for the Galaxy fixes that.

I have tried Roll for the Galaxy and thought that the engine building was fun (though I could never get off an engine before the game ended).

I am not thrilled about the card abilities being in hieroglyphics.

RATING: 7
What I like:

-A good quick fun game. Even though it's short, it still feels satisfying and fulfilling. It doesn't sacrifice strategy for this either. This is usually very hard to accomplish. 


What I dislike:
-Action selection where you are dependent upon what others do. I don't want to spent my whole game primarily looking and guessing what you might do and try to plan for that. It's fun to some extend, but this mechanic is just too much.
-The symbols are a pain to learn and teach. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Its better than San Juan.  Thats not saying much for me because I dislike San Juan.  The unique cards and the simultaneous action selection are a nice change.  My opinion of the game is improving as the icons are making more sense.  The last game took on a different flavor as a quick rush strategy was employed(barely successfully).  I am enjoying it right now, but I do wonder how many plays it will hold up.  I can't see this being as endlessly replayable as many do, but I hope it holds more than the 10 plays San Juan held up for me.

It took 4 plays before the light bulb clicked and I could put together a strategy.  

I played this game as a teaching session with open hands and slow slow play.  It took 1.5 hours, but my opponent figured out the game well enough to tie me in the second matchup.  This game really showed how rich and deep the hand management is in the game.  The role selection(at least in the non advanced game) is mostly trivial, but the richness of the hand management saves it.  That is the biggest difference for me in this game vs. San Juan.  San Juan's role selection is roughly similar, but the hand management in San Juan was far less situational and good cards are always good cards.  RFTG incorporates different values for the cards for the strategy one is incorporating.  Some cards are usual strong plays, very few are never strong plays, and most are situational good plays which just makes me happy. I strongly dislike San Juan after I "figured" it out, but I am still enjoying Race after my meager 50 plays.

There is just so much to explore.  The strategy of maximizing each of the 6 point development cards, each resource specialization, multi resource specialization, rushing with military, and developments.  Slower military, plus hybrids, plus things I have not even thought of yet..

I may have gone into my first game of Race for the Galaxy with a bit of a prejudice since I'd previously played San Juan a number of times and didn't like it at all, but I'd like to think that I kept a somewhat open mind about Race for the Galaxy and that I disliked it on its own merits.  It's impossible to not compare San Juan to Race for the Galaxy if you've played both though, and I'm certain that the reasons I don't like the former are pretty much the same reasons that I dislike the latter.  These card games are both just boring to me.  Hand management and card combinations are not mechanics that interest me, and they're not any quicker than board games, so I'd generally just rather be playing a board game instead.

Such a solid game. Once the symbols are learned and understood, the game becomes a breeze.

RATING: 10
This game is amazing and continues to get better as expansions are added. The symbology is straight foreword and relatively easy to learn (the base game comes with cheat sheets). For me, the key to a successful game of RftG is adaptability with a myriad of tactics up one's sleeve. I have a feeling that the people who say this game is a multiplayer solitaire game haven't actually figured out what it's all about.

I really wish I could teach this game to people in less than a million years.

RATING: N/A
I can see how this game is enjoyable for many people.  Unfortunately I desire at least moderate player interaction in a game, and this requires absoutely none.  The single interactive factor of the entire game is trying to figure out what other phases of the game that the other players will allow you to take advantage of.  Otherwise, it's one large game of solitaire, trying to build an interesting combo on your own side of the table.  It's not a BAD game, it's just not at all interactive.

RATING: 7
This is one of those games where I definitely need more plays to really feel it out, but even in the first pay it did click for me what was going on.  The quick play was a plus. My concern would be that it would get somewhat repetitive; and the almost zero interaction makes it feel almost like four solo games.  With experience I can see being able to strategize based on what action you think other players will choose, but that's not exactly interaction.

It is mind boggling the permutations of this game. Very well balanced, but I simply don't like it that much.

Reacting to your draw in the early game is key, no point hoping that your strategy for military will work out just because you started with a military advantage. Also reading your opponent and judging which stages they will play this turn is important.

RATING: 9
A blast to play and always seems to be competitive.

Tough to figure out on the first play, but then it is all biscuits and gravy from there.

Fast gameplay, lots of ways to win, cool theme. My favorite thing about the game is how the cards "make sense."  The stats aren't arbitrary, and sort of tell a little story.  For example, Old Earth produces nothing but can consume at a rapid rate, while the Expedition Force allows you to explore faster and adds military strength to your empire.  

The only thing that really takes points off from me is the tough entry-point for people who haven't played this kind of game before.  The game has its own "vocabulary", and the symbols of the cards take some getting used to. I also wish there was more player interaction, but it is a minor gripe at this point.  

The Advanced Two-Player variant in the manual is excellent, and I highly reccomend it once you're familiar with the basic game.

Race for the Galaxy is so nice to play that it is really difficult to lay down some comments. Its system is very well balanced and fun to play.

Apart from that, it is one of the best games of my collection.

RATING: 4
Tanga. First impression is that it's boring. Seems to be Puerto Rico with worse bits, less player interaction, and a big dose of random card draws.

And the theme is weak. How are robots a "planet" to settle? The goods are represented by putting cards face down on top of a planet card of one of four colors, which felt abstract, giving me trouble in trying to memorize what any of them were and what their relative worth was.

RFTG feels like a parody of simplistic bottleneck management euros, where you're typically concerned with short-term calculations and tactics. The random card draws ensure it can't be much more than this.

Small symbols...  to hard to read... too many mechanics... to much to learn....  blah blah blah blah...  

Look this game is AWESOME, and is a lot of fun.  Really good for people and kids who get upset when you can damage your opponents, for example roll a die and you lose a card or ship, attacking each other, etc. etc.  I am all for it, but this game takes that stress out of game time, and if you want it the interaction you get it with Rebel vs Imperium.  

You want to know why it is called "Race" for the Galaxy, play the game, after about 7 cards in you will be saying oh mann am I going to have enough turns to get there...

This game has a very steep learning curve.  The rule book does not help this at all and the cheat sheet looks like something from an engineering textbook.  However, once you get past that and the icons start making sense, and the game 'clicks', all the 'work' learning it pays off.  

This is easily in my top ten games of all time.  I think it especially shines as a two player although 3 and 4 are also nice.  I love the theme, the options, the card decisions, the race aspect.  

It is called a multi-player solitaire game by some which I can kind of understand, but really suggests that when they play those players don't look at all at what other players are doing or are likely to do on their turn.

RATING: 7
Many good ideas here. Many different strategies to try, and tough tactical choices. After play several games with the free Keldom AI, it seems there are a lot of clever play inside this 30 min cardgame. The game is fast and unforgiving: It`s often too late to change your path when you are losing. Anyway I like you have to take lots of hard decisions in just 30 min. However I am having a hard time with iconography, and 'galactic' environment is not one of my favourite themes. I don´t like so many 'planned' expansions to make the game 'complete'...I hate those 'suck money' marketing decisions, but I have to say base game is very good.

Ohhh the iconography. No doubt that the game is good but it's rather impenetrable the first games due to the heavy use of many different icons unfortunately. After that it's good but I'm not sure I'd rather not just play 3 games of Jump Drive instead.

Reduced rating from 7.75 -> 6.33 because I've found one's ability to successfully pursue a strategy is a bit too  dependent on the "turn of a friendly card" (relative to the length of a game) for my tastes.

Wonderful deck-building card game that I prefer over Dominion and indeed Puerto Rico from which this game derives. If you haven't played Puerto Rico or San Juan then the learning curve to begin with is rather high; indeed, we struggled with the rules to begin with but after a few plays it all becomes straight forward. I enjoy the amount of chance involved in finding cards in the deck; sometimes you may not see one certain card for many plays as cards are used as buildings, currency and goods. Interaction is very minimal also, however this is something our group actually likes. Downtime is usually quite low because people take their turns at the same time. However, I feel the 2-player variant is the best way to play this game as being able to play two actions a turn does make the game feel more snappy and enjoyable. Especially with the expansions the deck can get rather large and cumbersome to shuffle, which is why our group play a variant where we do not shuffle the starting worlds back in - how come this is not a variant rule in the game?

I'm glad I did not buy this game.  (All my friends own it.)  I've played it maybe 10-15 times now, and although I liked it the first 3-5 plays, it has become very boring to me.  The "race" aspect is the problem.  You just feel like you have to play a card too often to keep up with the other players.  San Juan had the same issue, but for some reason it was not as much of a problem for me.
I'm not saying this is bad, it's just that I'd rather play Glory To Rome, or to a lesser degree, San Juan.
I'm hopeful that the 5-player expansion will make this more fun.

There are so many options and so many combos. The gameplay is short, and once you've learned the game, it's easy. It works great for 2 players. What more could I want?

I'm tempted to push this rating above a 9, which I've only done with one other game - Dominion. I need to get another several plays in before making that decision. I wanted to wait until I had about 30 plays under my belt before deciding to raise the rating. I decided not to raise my rating above a 9. Here's why:

Luck. There are some unstoppable combos if someone gets lucky draws. By the same coin, luck can hose you pretty bad on your card draws. Military can be TOO powerful if someone draws all of it. Free worlds? What's not to like? Especially if they're alien military worlds...

If luck didn't feel like such a powerful force in this otherwise tactically pleasing game, I might raise my rating. Additionally, I've found that nobody requests this game because it's too mentally taxing to learn, especially during lunch breaks at work, when the players want to relax.

On the other hand, this has become one of (if not THE) my wife's favorite games. She always wants to play. I tell the guys at work that they'll enjoy it once they play a bunch, but the trick is getting them to reach that level...

UPDATE: I don't think I like this quite as much as I once did, but it's still fun. I have just as much fun with San Juan. I think it bothers me that RftG has some very obvious power-strategies (alien, military) that are much easier to accomplish than other strats (blue stuff).

I have concluded that if you want to be on friendly terms with me, you will not ask me to play Race for the Galaxy. I like it less every time I play it. And yet its mysterious popularity means that it actually destroys opportunities to play other games. 
Basically San Juan, only messier.  The array of different cards necessitates an off-putting icon language without adding anything that did anything for me, and the simultaneous role selection means there's even less interaction between players.

To quote another user: bloated, confusing, and ugly.

As many others have said, it feels like a solitaire game played by several people at once.  There is no player interaction or confrontation at all in this game.

RATING: 7
Very rewarding. It captures a lot of the 4X genre despite being a cardgame with a playing time of max 30 min. The variety of choices becomes limited against experienced players, as you have to stick to the best/first 6lvl Development-tactic on your hand.

I have two main problems with RftG.

a) The damned icons that are suppose to tell you what to do in each phase. They are ugly as hell and helps as much as sign language to a blind man.

b) The game feels like everyone are just doing a solitaire game and then comparing score in the end. 
Some of the expansions are suppose to add more interaction. But the game never caught on enough for me to pocket out for them.

Overall it's not a bad game. But I personally feel that I can spend my time with better games instead.

I'm not good at finding card combinations, which is why I don't like this game. So take my rating with a grain of salt. "It's not you, it's me." I don't like Dominion either, if that says something.

I do respect it, though. It's a solid game. And I can't see why people seem to have such a hard time with the icons and rules...

RATING: 8
Intellectually pristine. A dizzying richness of choice to build an interlocking tableau that once in a while is exquisite (ie: superb strategy, lovely metagame) or it's more a brain suck-candy of rapid torrent of micro decisions that collapses into an ending just in time. Or both. It nails something difficult to describe.

I tried hard not to like it, I shouldn't if I tick off the things that get me charged up about card & boardgames. I held off giving not a 10, ranging between 5 and 9, back & forth. I should not love it. Well, it's fantastic. Even it's aesthetics & backstory work, theres a shiny intelligence & adult mind in it's maker that shows through, and that carries through in every expansion, which are not corruptions but stay true to it's brilliant ideas & riffs off of them. It grows on you & after years now is a growing classic of original design. Even it's sci-fi theme is done artfully rather than childishly, usually stuff like this turns me off (I'm not a space opera nor hard science-fi, more Gene Wolfe or M. John Harrison type of guy).

I haven't played with goals; straight 2-player advanced only. So truly there's much more for me to know in terms of modulating it's pace. Even with 100s of plays.

*

The solo robot is terrific tho fiddly, I wish there was a different way to do it & maybe I need to invent my own metronome to play solo (it's worth getting that dialed in, this would be the best solo card game ever if this could be perfected, but damned if I know how). I do not play computer games, nor all these solo apps coming out these days, except a bit of cribbage to catch up my skills & shake off rust. But Keldon's AI & this intelligent & endlessly re-playable game are utter crack. That form is likely best stayed away from truthfully, theres nothing worse than a face hypnotized by a screen, but this one is either worth it or the worse crack ever invented & it will destroy civilization. It's that good.

One of my favourite two-player games. Quick playing time, some luck, but skill is a strong factor. Was worried about the "dreaded" learning curve, but figuring the game out was quite straightforward.

I haven't been able to wrap my head around this one yet and don't see what everybody sees as one of the best games ever played by human beings on planet Earth.  Granted it has some similarities to San Juan, but is way overcomplicated for the amount of game in it.

Terrific game. Iconography is very clean. Learning curve is steep-- it's not a hard game to learn how to play, but hard to learn how to play well. Not only do you need to build up an engine to get points/build cards, but you have to work on running down the game's "clock" while you're still ahead. A whole lot of game in a very short space. The two-player experienced game is my preferred version.

My favorite card game. Luck can be a factor as with all card games, but most of all this rewards skill and experience. I don't have much of the former, but am getting more of the latter, and that sees me through to victory frequently. I am rubbish against the AI.

The wife didn't like the game very much at first, but the introduction of the first expansion seemed to open it up for her, and now the games are much closer and victory less assured.

Based on 2 player experiences only:

I love, love, love RFTG.  And so does my wife.  When we first bought the game, and she was relatively new to tabletop gaming, there was clearly no expectation that this would become a staple.  The theme was a bit of a turnoff to her, and I prefer high fantasy to sci-fi, but this didn't matter.  

The game is similar to San Juan, another one of our favorites, but certainly has a lot of depth/complexity that San Juan has without much more time involved.  Both are great games and it depends on our mood.  San Juan is easy to bring out over breakfast or a cup of coffee; RFTG is better for an evening after the kids go to bed. 

2 player is the way to go in this!

Some complain about the iconography; I would disagree.  It's really very simple to figure out, and for the one or two icons that I would agree are.. less than clear, the game comes with a good guide to answer your question.

Just dont get this game or what the fyzz is all about There does not seem to be much control of either what you or you opponents do.

Too complicated for how much luck is ultimately involved.  So much depends on your card draws relative to your starting hand.  There are also a couple of overpowered cards.  It is fun, but not the end-all-be-all that everyone seems to think it is.  Personally I'd rather play San Juan.

I love this game.  I love managing the chaos and luck of the draw.  I love finding the synergies of cards in my hand with those on the table.  I love the quick play.  I'd rather play RftG than just about anything else.  This game is a 10.  

The 1st expansion makes the game even better.  It provides better balance between build and consume strategies, adds more variety in starting, and adds the extra complexity of goals.  Too bad I cannot rate it an 11!

I have become less enamoured with the goals.  It seems that they add further randomness to the game.  For instance, the most military goal strongly favors a military strategy, but if I never see the approprite cards, that goal is inaccessible.  There is already high variability in strategies based on the cards seen, and this exacerbates the problem, making too otherwise equivalent strategies unequivalent because of their ability to reach the randomly drawn goals.

RATING: 9
Tentative rating after six plays (expected to rise after more). The game has a lot going for it: Many ways to score, great combo-possiblities, very little downtime due to simultaneous actions. It's like a gamer's version of San Juan. Unfortunately, I do not care for the artwork -- it is rather dull, especially when compared to most of the CCGs out there. Or even, again, San Juan. The times I played with more than two players, I did like it a bit better btw. 
Finally, I had an experienced gameplayer give up half through a game because the icons still confused him. Learning curve can be steep for some.
UPDATE: My 14 year old son did not have any difficulty grasping the rules. We now play with the 2-player variant for experienced players as well as the cards from the first expansion. After all these years I return to this game and find it to be better than most new games I recently played. Very addictive!

It took me a long while before I decided to start playing race for the galaxy and I am still not really convinced about the hype for this game. There is undoubtedly a dizzying array of choices and strategies to pursue in this game and at the moment, my head is still spinning from the optimal strategies for this game. I started playing the AI version of this game and perhaps I will come to love this game more further down the road. Can't really make a solid conclusion yet, so a 7.

Better than San Juan.  It brought back a 'shipping' aspect to collect victory points.  You also can choose your own actions each round so your not stuck with whatever is left in San Juan.  There is also a greater variety of cards.  I look forward to grabbing some of the expansions.

Was intrigued by the event selection mechanics a la Puerto Rico, but like the latter game, haven't had a chance to try it since. Vacillating between wanting to give it a try and not particularly caring.

RATING: 5
My first play of this was an utter disaster. I was taught by someone who had only previously played once before; which meant that she had no idea what all the icons meant and didn't understand all the cards.

A second teaching game wouldn't happen till a year later, and finally understanding all the icons, it was a curious experience. I've since played it numerous times against the AI, losing miserably as I tried to come to grasp with the strategies. 

It's been an interesting journey but not something entirely enjoyable. The AI is good, which has made it quite a steep learning curve but I keep wondering where the fun is. Sure it's entertaining when I win against the AI, but there are times I feel like I've been lucky. Drawing that 6 cost development card, or 7 cost military planet just in the nick of time to secure a win. The most thematic part of this game is the military strategy; everything else is a bit of a wash. 

What's the difference between this game and Innovation which I really enjoy? The fact that in Innovation, almost every ability is broken in the right circumstances and you set yourself up to take advantage of the cards that are coming up - the cards coming up are set within a band of varying effects. You can't do that in Race for the Galaxy, you set yourself up and sometimes you get there, sometimes you don't. It's a real lack of control.

Would I recommend this game? Sure? It's okay. 

At least noone can say I didn't give this game a fair shake.

This one has steadily become more enjoyable the more we've played. Started at a 6 or 7. Not sure when it will level off. If it had a board it would be a 9!

After many, many plays has dropped to a 7 - bored with it now, feels like you're doing the same old things each game. Still, more than paid for itself!

The super filler / super deep game that is way too addictive. The game always seems to end a round too early, keeping you wanting more.

If you can believe it, this game manages to take San Juan and give it even *less* player interaction! (Note: this is not true now that I've played more.)

On the bright side, there are more cards, with more complex effects, which means it'll take much more time to grow familiar and old.  Let's start with a 7.5, heading down to a 6 but not for awhile.

...Make that heading up to an 8, with the expansions, and with a drafting variant for 2p, both of which give this game more legs (and interaction) than I had expected.  The first two expansions are really necessary to get the full Race experience; BoW is still quite good but not as essential.

On reflection, I'm reluctant to play this until an expansion adds more direct interaction between the players. I'm not analytical enough to stare at everyone else's configuration to work out the phase that will hinder them and help me best - playing the game at that level would slow things down to a crawl. Great mechanisms and beautiful card design are marred by the actual experience of playing it. I prefer San Juan.

I love this game for its combination of high complexity and short length. It condenses the economic engine-building experience of a longer eurogame into a playing time of half an hour - it never outstays its welcome like, say, Ora et Labora. 

Despite the "multiplayer solitaire" criticism that has often been leveled against it, the game does have quite a bit of interaction in deducing what phases your opponent will select and leeching off of them. RftG really does feel like a race, with each player rushing to force the end of the game while they're ahead. The tension is palpable.

Elegant, fast, and extremely re-playable. Highly recommended.

Edit: I've just about stopped recording my plays of this - there are too many, too often. Upped to a ten.

The only thing that keeps it from a 10 is that it's a pain to teach to newer players-- which I'm not really sure how to fix, even though I do preset hands + no expansions (and especially not that third one)

Sci fi theme, strategy card game.

This game is good.  Despite the light theme and short play length, I think there is a lot to think about here and many different ways to win.  We have only played two player games so far and I have enjoyed them all.

Nearly three hundred plays in and this game still delivers.  Tried it now with variable numbers of players and though the game feels different with 4 or 5 players, it is still an excellent game.

A fun game, but really lacking in player interaction.  Some of the expansions help with this, but for the most part you're competing separately and just seeing who has the highest score at the end.

I prefer San Juan... or Puerto Rico... or Galactic Emperor.  Base game is mostly multi-player-solitaire, and the symbology hurdle is hard to pull new players over.  It's not a bad game, but it certainly doesn't push any good buttons for me.

We love this game.  It takes 2 or 3 games to get the hange of the symbols.  I think it might take much longer to get a handle on all the strategies.  There is a lot of depth which leads to lots of replayability.

When RftG was released, I played it a couple of times with some friends and it didn't really click. Only recently I gave it a second shot, after trading another game for it. It took some time but I learned to quite like it. RftG plays quickly and it's a challenge to build up your empire. Unfortunately the love is not shared by my girlfriend, so I installed the iOS version as well. Now all I need is to become a star, dealing with planets and technologies.

I like the base game, but wish there were more cards that directly influence what your opponent is doing.  You both build up an empire, but they are never include conflicts between them.  I understand that this was an intentional design decision.  I guess later expansions are supposed to add direct conflict.  But, without those, you don't get that.

In spite of that, it's still a fun game.

I absolutely love this game: simultaneous play, such depth, so many strategies!  But I'm terrible at it: just can't train myself to look across the table at what other players are doing, which is so important if you're going to do well at the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I wish that this game didn't have such a steep learning curve.  The iconography is great once you understand what it all means and how the game is played, but learning this language is extremely daunting for new players.  As a result, I don't get to play this as often as I would like because we've had some turnover in the regular attendees to our weekly game nights, and the new crop of people don't know how to play.  We would usually rather play something less intimidating than spend the requisite thirty or so minutes teaching the game to newbies.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Wow...what a well-designed deep game.  I enjoy this even when I lose badly, which is often.

So many pathways to victory and so many possible synergies in card play make this a truly engaging experience.

I always encourage players to refer to the "goods" by their name as opposed to the color.  ('Alien Technology' as opposed to 'yellow')  It helps keep the theme a bit more immersive.

Only negatives:

- tough for newbie/non-gamers to learn
- some may be turned off by the lack of direct player interaction

Civ building, resource management, and trying to anticipate what your opponents will do are three aspects of this game that truly set it apart from its contemporaries.

While the core set may have led to a script in 2-3 player games, it is much (much) more difficult to run away with the game with 5-6 players.

Not a big fan of takeovers, though- as they ruin the (building) aspect of the game.

RATING: 9
Love this game.  Hits this very special niche where it is easy to play any time in any mood.  Even when brain dead after work.  Once you learn the system it becomes quick and easy to play.  Yet the card variety offers so much depth that you can still find new strategies and combos.  Each game plays very differently.  So much replayability in this game.  It takes about 5 games to learn how all of the system interact and another 5 to learn how to manipulate them and to start figuring out the good cards.  Please push through this learning curve.  There is a very beautiful game underneath.

Quick setup. Lots of strategic depth. Lots of viable ways to win. Feels like Puerto Rico "light", better than San Juan. Less turn-based, because everyone is essentially playing at the same time..so games go quickly. Can turn around three 2player games in an hour. Yet feels like you got a full gaming meal instead of just an appetizer.  All around great game. It hits our table a few times per week. Highly recommended and it just gets better with the expansions!

RATING: 8.5
Pros: simultaneous action selection mechanic, hand management with tableau building, variable strategies with moderate degree of luck, engine building, quick playtime

Cons: limited winning strategies that consistently perform, other strategies situational and luck-dependent, no direct player interaction; confusing iconography when learning the game

A great strategy card game for those who enjoy building engines. Can be a little fiddly to simultaneously manage your hand, your action card pool, and your tableau--that combined with a fairly steep learning curve as one gets to know individual cards and strategies (not to mention the iconography!) may turn one off from this game. However, if you can get past that in the initial dozen plays (and those plays go fast!), you will find a rewarding game. My experience is mostly limited to two-player games, though, so I cannot comment on the higher player counts. Regardless, it is a well-balanced game that has just the right amount of luck for my tastes.

RATING: 8
A quick play after you get a few games under your belt. Like Shogun, it seems like you are just getting yourself organized when the game is over. That's the interesting part: you have to decide what you are doing and not get sidetracked by other strategies and paths of development. Each draw of cards can lead you to rethink what your grand plan is. On the other hand, you have to stay somewhat flexible and diversified because you may never get the cards you need to win the game.

Another "Wouldn't Say 'No'" game. Race is a strategists nightmare, as you're always wanting to play just one more card before you get 3 more, all of which you want to play as well. I think I'm getting addicted to Race... O.O

What seems complicated at first is actually simple once you know how to play the game.  This game requires strategy as well as knowing how the other people you play with operate.  Learn the symbols and most of the difficulty of the game is gone - the rest is up to how you play.  Expansions are not needed to enjoy, but do give you more options and enough cards for 2 extra players (turning a 2-4 player game into a 1-6 player game).

After over 125 plays this game just gets better and better for me.  My wife continues to beat me at this.  She understood this game much quicker than I did, but I really enjoy the challenge of playing against her.  We mostly play two player which is awesome.  I didn't understand this game for the first dozen plays.  It felt like multiplayer solitaire.  The more I play it the more I understand the player interaction.  I really like the term in the description for this game.  "Parasitic conflict".

Edit: The expansions make a great game even better!  Raising my rating to a 10.  This game has staying power.

For my brain, this was the hardest game for me to figure out. The symbols just screwed with my brain for some reason. Age of Steam?  Easy to learn. Even all of Wallace games. and Tigris and Euphrates......easy.  RfTG........third game finally felt fluid......and i think i like it......not in love with it yet.  will keep trying with her.

update: i like Glory to Rome much better.  I like San Juan better.  For some reason, it just doesn't flow well.......i wonder if people just like this because they have figured out the system and how to work it, rather than feeling challenged by it. i don't know.....downgrading the damned thing to a 7

Very solid card game that takes a bit of time to learn the mechanics and much more time to learn every card and the relative strengths they offer.  As a result, it is a particularly effective game when all or almost all players are new to it and can continue to play it multiple times as they all learn and adapt and try new strategies.  Gameplay during learning is vastly different from when comfortable.  Comfortable players can finish a game in about 10 minutes.

Since People will ask...I found the game...not terribly innovative and not nearly as interesting as other card games such as Dominion, MTG, Citadels. And, the iconography while I understand the reasons it was selected I still believe was terrible design. I have never EVER had a game bomb so hard at the table when playing. After the first game several players were actually angry they had had to play it.

Lots of mechanics to win the game... meaning lots of decissions in each game and a lot of variability, thus awesome replayability value. Great art in the cards for not-so-much value also.

However, it's actually heavy and not only because of the symbols (very nice idea IMO), but because of its engine-building and continuous optimization. 

Really a must for medium-heavy gamers.

This and San Juan are my only 10s. Of these, RftG is the "hot" game, but generally I'd choose which to play based on who I was playing with. I have taught SJ to new players (including non-gamers) and in general they understood and enjoyed it from the outset, whereas RftG is harder to get into.  Also, while I agree that the (unexpanded) RftG is far from "multiplayer solitaire", I do find role selection in SJ to be more pleasingly interactive.

Update: it's now more than a year now since I last played San Juan, while RftG I have played A Lot. Dominion is now also a 10.

Race for the Galaxy plays fast (with a little experience) and rewards flexibility. The game provides agonising choices on what to keep and what to discard. It's a great game with play as a warm up, in between games or to wind down, and plays equally well with any numbers of people.

The downside is the iconography which occasionally turns people off, and makes each person's first game a state of constant confusion.

Yes, it do remind me to San Juan.
Compared to it, it lacks the option to choose the timing of the actions (exploring is always before settling, for example).

But it adds so much to San Juan, that I prefer it to it nevertheless:
- different strategies (compared to the common guild hall)
- different production "buildings" (production/windfall worlds)
- great icons to see the abilities of cards on one glance

Maybe this one goes down for me after a dozens plays more, but I doubt it.

Before make a judgement, you should play at least 5 round or more first. This is one of the great game I have. If you try to beat me in 2 players game, you better be able to score higher than 40, there only 1-2 times out of 25+ games that I score below 40.

I like this game a lot, but it's kind of hard to play it casually.  It's one of those games that an experienced player has a large edge over anyone new.  It takes a while to learn all the cards well enough to know how to play the odds.

I'll play this over Puerto Rico in a heartbeat.  They're not completely comparable, but this game has still completely replaced what I saw as a very good game at one time.

Excellent card game.  So many ways to play and so many ways to win.  This is one of the only games in which I like the random element.  Adaptability is everything in this game, and the game gives you the tools to implement new adaptations in strategy.  Even though the cards eventually sway the tide, more often than not, your success will be because of an ability and insight to ride that tide, instead of being swept under.  Bonus points for not being a CCG (although numerous expansions slightly detracts from this bonus).  This is probably the highest score I will ever give to a card game, and it is richly deserved.

San Juan in space with a whole lot of stuff going on.  This is another Puerto Rico card game re-themed for space.  Cards are everything except VPs.  In this game they actually added counters for victory points and running out is one of the end game conditions.  You buy/conquer planets (producers) or developments (buildings).  Goods are consumed for cards and/or victory points.  You get to select a single game phase (trade) and you get the bonus for that phase.  A major difference is multiple people can select the same game phase.  There's a ton of stuff going on and lots of decisions to be made.  I fully expect this game will advance to a 10 with further play.

To be fair to this game, I really don't care for it's inspiration ([gameid=3076]), so this game was fighting an uphill battle from the start if I was ever going to like it.  The people who like this game seem to want to play it all the time, but I have yet to see anything but the driest of efficiency engines.  Pick stuff that benefits you and not others, railroad yourself into a very artificial strategy based on an artificially constrained role-selection mechanism, and basically stay far away from any kind of thematic ties. I was hoping that the space theme would show through somehow, even though this was a VP engine game.  My hope was in vain.

Which is a tribute to the "gameriness" this game has. The only trouble I have with it is that I have no desire to teach it to new players. Learning curve is so long that they probably will never catch-up :(

Much better than my single play of San Juan to which this is readily compared.

Having played San Juan, learning the basic flow of this game was a little easier than I expected after a quick view of the cards and the player aid.   This will be a staple at our game store group for a long time.  Quick game play, scales well from 2 to 4 players, most people like it and will play it.  It has a "bushy" decision tree and can seem overwhelming at first, however kind of like a foreign language - once you can decipher the symbols on the cards easily the game plays much easier and strategy can develop a little easier.  I still don't "get" the consume trade and consume x 2 as much as I should.

I can already tell that my wife and I will be able to enjoy this game for many years to come. The iconography was certainly daunting at first, but I feel like the player aids and the rulebook do a fantastic job of distilling it into relatively easy-to-understand pieces. The array of potential winning combinations seems boundless. While the game isn't as thematic as some of the other games in our collection, I definitely appreciated the artwork, and I enjoyed some of the humorous touches (Galactic Resort, anyone?). An extremely pleasing addition to our collection.

[Played 11 times]

Nice game, but it has no place for me. If I want a game full of different cards with endless interactions, I've Magic. If I want a similar idea, but with simpler execution (thus more accessible to newbies), I've San Juan. "Race for the Galaxy" is a sort of middle ground I simply do not need.

Extremely light interaction and quite long learning curve due to the many cards and the abstruse myriads of symbols (that also failed to make it language independent, since there's text here and there too!).

The sci-fi theme and the bland artwork do nothing for me as well.
Pricey.

Easily my favorite game right now. Each time we play, the game is completely different. I love the different paths that everyone can take to victory. My only small gripe is that like the "Factory Strategy" in Puerto Rico, the "Military Strategy" in RftG encourages the player to end the game too quickly.

Wow, this game is awesome! I'm still struggling to get the strategy part down, but it seems that with several plays it will become even deeper and more engrossing.

Confusing at first with all the symbols, but it is a pretty simple game after you play it a couple times.

This is one of the first "gamers games" I ever acquired (after Settlers & Dominion). I've played a grip of games on BGA as well, mostly 2 player. I think the game plays best with 2 players (2p advanced variant), but it's fun with more also. Unfortunately the learning curve can be slightly steep with all of the iconography. Once you learn it though, I prefer it to a block of text on each card, and it becomes intuitive. I would rate the 2p advanced variant as a 10, I will basically never play this at 3+. I would always pull out Roll for the Galaxy with more than 2 players.

One of my absolute favorite games, and a perfect one to play over lunch at work. It's lots of fun and has tons of re-playability. Not quite the most accessible because of the large amount of iconography, but once you get the hang of it, it's great!

One basic game behind, none of us was really experienced in this game, which most likely explains some of the strange situations in the game. For example there was only one consume phase in the whole game. I finished the game when I built my 12th card and ended up winning with quite a lot of points. The first game was quite slow in tempo, but I believe this will be faster in the future. Also the game mechanics and tactics will open more after couple of games.

RftG is the best SF-themed card game out there. It boasts an infinity of possibilities, not one game plays the same. It is quite a brain burner though, takes ages to learn how to play and is tough to teach. There is no direct player interaction, however, it is great that the game allows you to predict an opponent's action selection and adjust your own accordingly.

RATING: 10
Excellent card game with deep strategy involved and various paths towards victory. Very convenient that all the card actions are drawn as symbols and very short descriptions right on the cards themselves. It might be useful to keep a spreadsheet at your hands with all the mweanings/explanations of the various symbols for ease of play. Otherwise the game plays really fast and is very interactive. One play may last around 20 minues for 2 - 3 players once you know all the rules.

Of course the play time will increase with other expansions icnluded (e.g. "Rebel vs Imperial"). It will also add to the strategic variation and complexity of the game.

All in all this is one of my most favorite games I have. I like the "RftG" better than "Dominion". It's really, really fun to play. And the fact that you see your empire growing right in fron of your eyes just makes you feel more powerful and dnagerous... Choose who you want to be - builder, alien, military or anything else or a combination of everything.

Oh I really really really like this game. A lot. Maybe my favorite game. This game is pretty hard to teach. We usually work people up to this game by doing 7 Wonders then Puerto Rico then this. There are some shared mechanics. And then there is one rule that causes disputes (sometimes heated) every time we play it. But I love it. Really challenging. Perfect balance of chance and strategy.

I've been teaching this one to my entire group and I'm sure I've caused a few of them to purchase the game. A quick and fun card game. Not too much player interaction but the fun comes from trying to make the best of the hand you are dealt. The Sci-Fi theme definitely kicked the game up a notch as well for me. Hi score 70 for 2 players and 62 for 3 players. Both consumeX2/Produce engines.

I like the mechanics interacting with each other, but I greatly dislike the symbology and convoluted nature of the cards. I like the combos I DO manage to set up, but there are so many moving parts, and no card is very clear on what it does. You essentially ALWAYS have to read your cards every turn. The only solution would be to play this one game over and over for weeks, but even then I am sure I would forget most cards' use after not playing for a week or two. 

Needs more clear differentiation on the cards based on what it does.

UPDATED: Gave the game another chance using a tutorial video and the Keldon AI after putting it up for trade. Once I got past my incomprehension and the offputting cards, I love it.

I bought RftG as a gift for my husband and wish I hadn't. We mostly play two-player and I'd rather play anything else. It simply wasn't fun.

I found it hard to learn due to confusing/odd icons and unthematic mechanics. When I learned how to play, it felt surprisingly non-interactive. I'm sure there is some way to use the action selection mechanic (you select an action each turn and your opponent does the same one) to screw your opponent. I was too bored to find it.

The card stock is thin, the box was disappointingly empty of content, and the art is ugly.

exceptional card game. my initial impressions of this game when i had first played it at a board game night were rather indifferent almost negative. it seemed abstract the theme seemed detached and i could not shake the feeling that no one knew what they where doing. months later, without having another opportunity to play the game, i got it! it all became clear in hindsight. the mechanics are a masterwork the symbols are excellent and clear the theme fits and welcomes you into a world of possibilities. i believe this is an all time great. atleast for me. very much enjoy finding a "mature" game of this nature.

Worst "game" I have ever played. Avoid at all cost.
"You need to play it 10-20 times before you get it and can start to enjoy it".
No I won't - I'll just play some other, good, actual games 10-20 times. Rubbish.

FreeCell + Rock-Paper-Scissors with boring generic sci-fi theme. Extremely solitaire, random and obscure. Essentially just a puzzle trying to get the most out of a random sequence of cards with the absolute only "interaction" being looking at the other players' played cards and number of cards in hand to guess which of the 5 roles they choose to get you an extra free action. Absolutely nothing you do affects other players except that they cannot get the cards you have played (and "my best action would be X but my opponents may guess that that so I will do Y, instead"). Assuming equally skilled players, the winner will simply be the one who draws the best, random cards. Add to that poorly designed, unnecessarily obscure iconography which makes the game directly hostile to new/casual players; and the need to learn the hundreds of different cards and card combinations to do well. As a solitaire, smartphone app or PC game, it could be an alternative time-killer/waster to FreeCell etc. It is a puzzle, not a game. AVOID!

This game is unfortunately a beast to teach, but if you have players who know what they are doing or are willing to learn - this game is absolutely fantastic.

Fantastic engine building card game. Can be overwhelming your first game but you catch on quickly. Plays 2-4 players well though I like it with lower player counts even more. Never the same game twice. Multiple paths to victory. There is some luck with card draw which is to be expected. The theme and components are both solid. The more I play this the more I enjoy it.

RATING: 10
On the one hand, it is similar enough to San Juan to keep my interest.  On the other hand, it's overly complicated on the first play, and it's possible for newbs to flounder through the first game to get a grasp of exactly how the game flows.  It's not as intuitive as San Juan, mainly due to its complexity, but the shine becomes apparent even before that first game is over.  By the second and third games, the strategies start to reveal themselves.  After more plays, you can fly through the turns like you're passing through a yield sign instead of a stop sign.  It's a little bit like peeling an onion, though without the crying.

Well ... depending on the game group, there MIGHT be crying.

If you're playing 2-player, it's almost necessary to play with the advanced selection cards.  There's enough of a game for two with the basic roles,  but it really improves when you include the subtlety of multiple actions each turn.

Speaking of subtleties, the interaction in this game is such.  The player who can best read the others and anticipate what they will do on a given turn will play the better game, as will the player who understands that consumption is a required action.  Players who aren't afraid to force others to sell their goods before they're ready will play the better game, as well.

Jogo de cartas que no começo parece ser complicado demais, mas depois ele se mostra bem intuitivo. Tem muitas possibilidades dentro do jogo, tornando a rejogabilidade dele bastante grande.

First it's completely luck based and random, since you know jack about the cards. :D After few plays it starts making sense and you start developing strategies. After thirty or so plays it is luck based again :D You and your oponent(s) can probably work out the best strategy with the cards available, so the winner will be the one who will be lucky enough to get the best combo (unless you're playing with some sort of an expert). Still fun puzzlish and solitairish sort of game, but after many plays it sort of loses it shiness (well as many other games do) It was good enough to get played 30+ times.

After my first play, I rate this game a conservative seven with expectations that this rating will rise. I look forward to the expansions that (reportedly) will let me play this game with five players. One of the concerns I have with this game is that, like most CCG's, the barrier to entry is stiff because you really need familiarity with the card mix. Imagine Puerto Rico with twice as many building types; if this thought seems fun to you, then this game might appeal. I'm not sold on it yet, though.

The best thing about this game is that it's short.

The random selecting of which phases you're allowed to vote for is a terrible mechanic and simply shouldn't exist.  Doesn't make any sense that one player could randomly have their 2 duplicate cards discarded and another player could lose the ability to trade or vote for production, or both.

Aside from that, there's not really any connection to the other players aside from the vote on phases, so it feels a lot like every player is in a game of solitaire and then at the end you see who got the best card draw.

Each turn each player chooses one action, but the others will share in the actions chosen, each player secretly and simultaneously chooses one of seven different action cards and then reveals it.

This game is awesome! I love just how many decisions the designers managed to cram into such a relatively short playtime. The key here is that even though there are tons of difficult decisions, everyone is playing simultaneously. The result is that the game is compact and wonderfully diverse. My only gripe is that it's a real pain to teach this to casual gamers - even stuff like Agricola is more accessible. Still, once the learning is over, this is an amazing game that I hope to be playing many years into the future.

Race for the Galaxy is one of those rare games in which each play is better than the last. The icon system is a well documented nightmare (I still feel like there had to be better way) but once you clear that hurdle, its depth of strategy is astounding. It borrows a ton of mechanics from San Juan, (So many in fact, that learning Race for the Galaxy is much easier if you are familiar with it's little brother...) yet develops them so fully that it becomes a completely different (and better) game.

This is a great game in its own right; I know many people who have played this and loved it without experiencing Puerto Rico. However, I did play both PR and SJ before this, so it's hard for me to think of this independently of them. There are some things I think it does better than PR; I like how quickly it plays, how you're never totally barred from taking the action you desperately need, and how the theme resonates a bit more (at least for me). On the other hand, every few games you get someone who starts out strong and fizzles because the cards they need just don't come (also a weakness in SJ, but not PR) and the iconography is really difficult for non-gamers to decipher (particularly military vs. non-military placements). Still, it's a lot of fun, and the more I play it, the more I appreciate the strategies, which is always better than the other way around.

Update: That last sentence was true for a while, but it got a bit stale eventually. I feel like the production strategy is too strong unless you get a really great military hard. Still not a bad game, but no longer one I'd seek out when there are better options.

Fair warning, a person's first game of RFTG is punishingly cruel & barely makes sense. Nevertheless, one game is usually enough to see the brilliant dynamic hiding behind all those hieroglyphics. In short order, there's a moment when everything clicks & those hieroglyphics make absolute sense.

Pretty empty box, but linen-textured cards and nice player aids.  A clear improvement on San Juan, throwing in a little Puerto Rico as well.  The simultaneous selection is rich but not time-consuming.  Card variety is great, as are plenty of "hooks" for new powers (as befits a CCG lineage), where I'm sure the expansion will bring the game into its own.  I kind of wish the developments weren't duplicated.  Love the vastly more interesting (than SJ) 6-cost devs.

Draw luck can hit pretty hard early on.  It's an uphill climb if you simply can't take advantage of your strengths, esp. if your opponents don't suffer similarly.

This is a great, fast game.  The symbology presents a bit of a learning curve, but if you've played Puerto Rico, San Juan or a similar game, it should make sense pretty quickly.

Regarding the theme, I really don't understand the complaints that it is pasted on here.  Sure, it is a game that could be rethemed with some work.  But every card's abilities fit perfectly with its title, the artwork is great, and there are some very clear examples of theme-driven mechanics, most notably, the settle/military dichotomy.  I think it's a great theme, very well executed, and clearly drove aspects of the game's development rather than being pasted on after the fact.

(If you're looking to waste a little time, check out the the little app+AI for this game.  It's great.  I've played several zillion games against it now...)

Race for the Galaxy is my favourite game of all time. I played the base game 3000+ times and it's always exciting. I'd rather play the original than the new dice version. Unlike many other engine building games, I find it neither dry nor repetitive. The opportunity cost of each choice makes the game engaging and challenging.

As I like space themed games and games about building something up, I really wanted to like this game. But for a card game (which should be easy to learn, set up and play) there were too many rules and cardbord tokens. this games was often compared to San Juan but in terms of the rules and the components it is too convuluted to be compared to the fairly simplistic San Juan.

Downgraded to a 9, while I still enjoy the game, I feel the last expansion (TBOW) weakened the game overall.  While I don't feel I can go back, the new cards and new mechanics seem to bog the game down a bit.

RATING: 9
The depth to game length ratio is over the roof here, this is definitely the most complex and intricate economic card game I've ever played. Works beautifully in an advanced 2-player mode (in fact this is where it really shines). The iconography may be daunting at first, but once you understand the language of the game everything becomes a second nature. I love the card management and engine building aspect of this game, it's a great puzzle.

Another big plus for me is the unique artwork on every card - this really helps the theme come through.

[b]/update, February 2018:[/b] "Objectivelly speaking" it's a 10, I've downgraded it to a 9 just because I'm a little burnt out on it after countless online plays. I need a break from this game (it's still a masterpiece in its genre though).

Thank you slow shipping person!  Initial day - Played five straight games in about four hours,  including two teaching sessions (taught by me, who'd only read the rules online beforehand).  Everyone loved it,  and so did I!  Fast, Strategic = Maximal fun-to-gaming time ratio.  In my mind,  equivalent to Puerto Rico and San Juan combined - and would much rather play this than either!  The rating would continue to rise, but it's already at 10 :)Empire building/resource management game in less than an hour - start with minimal abilities but with high power escalation curve.  Diverse strategies to convert money (cards) into points - building an economic engine and point-scoring engine in the process.See my Nitpicker's guides for more details, but in short:  Beautiful art (empty box).  VP chips could be bigger.  Initial curve involves absorbing lots of symbols,  but the payout is a balanced game with incredible strategic depth and multiple paths to victory.  The subtle interaction between players is a bit of a relief - "downstream from the newbie" or "pick on the player" is pretty much gone, and the game is pure racing.I've played this game more than any other game I've bought in 2007 (and I bought it late Nov 2007).  Remains a tough cookie to teach, and everyone finds it a bit overwhelming the first time,  but most are willing to go for the rematch. Or three.  I'm still making mistakes teaching it - gotta remember to not try to teach it from my head.  Head always forgets critical bits.I've put the action cards in hard plastic sleeves.  The main deck has started getting a bit sticky,  so I've tentatively put the rest of the cards in clear soft sleeves.  The deck is a little larger,  trickier to shuffle and it can slip if not stacked carefully, but it seems about as easy to play with as before.Jay said spring 2008 for the expansion!  Woohoo!The Wish List:  Bigger - larger VP chips,  larger (say Blue Moon sized) cards with larger text (and text on all cards explaining powers).  I love the icons,  but the decoder sheet is definitely rough on newbies.

I really enjoy this one.  Yes, the card play is a bit solitaire-ish, but it moves so fast that doesn't matter to me.  Also, there is a fair bit of interaction in guessing what your opponents will play.  I think it is more fun than San Juan, as the strategies seem more varied.   You are definitely beholden to your cards, but it's short and fun.

After one play, I'm not sure how to rate this. I think the visuals are confusing as hell, and the whole thing feels a lot more like adding cogs to a machine than "playing a game."

This game is extremely elegant. The heavy use of symbols over text keeps the cards uncluttered and a joy to look at. However it just wasn't a whole lot of fun to play.

Really enjoyable, fast game. I've played it a lot at this point (20+ games) and I've decided that I can't keep both this one and San Juan and San Juan wins between them for my money. The main reason for this is that RftG feels more like a solitaire game with the phase selection mechanism, whereas with San Juan when it's your turn you are able to select something that makes sense for you over others (you can kind of do this in RftG and good play means selecting correctly, but I find a lot of the time we are just playing in parallel instead of "against" each other). Now that I feel I've explored the strategy space I am kind of done unless I buy into the expansions, and I don't think it's really good enough to do that.

A must have for any serious collection. Combos need learning fast to get anywhere. Newcomers need lots of help. Nice change from fantasy artwork.

Put some time in and learned the game properly. This game is starting to bite. almost too scared to let it delve deep into my nether regions.

RATING: 9.5
Race for the Galaxy is het spel dat ik het meest heb gespeeld.

Spelers zijn beginnende heersers van een ruimterijk dat ze zo snel en succesvol mogelijk proberen uit te bouwen.

Dit spel is voor mij zo'n groot succes omdat het snel is te spelen en iedere kaart in een legio aan situaties is toe te passen, geen enkel spel dat ik tot nu toe gespeeld heb heeft me een gevoel gegeven dat ik het al een keer gedaan heb.

Hiernaast is het ook nog eens een uitstekend spel voor met 2 spelers en je hebt een formule die naar meer smaakt, heel veel meer.

Great game. I'm a big Sci-fi fan and the game plays fast but offers strategic options. Luck can play a factor when someone gets great draws but the games are fast enough it's not a huge deal to lose one.

RATING: 7
Great to play the second or third time.  The first time the icon system is a b!tch.  Quite difficult to teach.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Impenetrable icons on the cards and unclear rules. Many raving about it but not sure why. I've heard that once you've played it enough it's wonderful. But I don't think I can be bothered. I need something which is more immediately appealing.

RATING: 8
Very unique card game.  Once you learn all the symbols used on the cards, it is quite easy to play.  Works great with all numbers of players and has many different ways to collect the most points to win.

The quick-reference guide is very useful for your first few plays, too.

RATING: 7
San Juan...in space.  I find the graphics a little distracting, but they add incredible ambiance to the game.  Some nice differences from San Juan, that make it feel a bit different, but still very similar.  If you like San Juan and you like Space theme...this is a must buy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Tentative rating after a few plays. Really unsure about this one. Doesn't seem to be much interaction at all, therefore how much of a game is it? But trying to get your card and VP engines going is pretty fun. Symbology is good, takes a while to get used to it. Hard to teach to those who haven't played San Juan or PR. Rating will move, just not sure in which direction. Hoping the expansion adds more player interaction. 

Update - Up a point to 7. Nothing you can do to stop someone, other than to GO FASTAR URSELF! A game I just have fun playing, and it looks cool while playing it. Thinking the rating will continue to go up.

Update - The short playing time, and the fact that it works well with two, leaves me always saying, to anyone who happens to be around, "You know, I think there's time for a little Race..." Moving it up to 8.

Right now, my favorite game. It has all that makes Puerto Rico sweet but with even more potential for branching out into new strategies with each card draw. The one downside is that it's tough to teach, but I'm hoping that playing PR first will open this up as an easier game to disseminate.

Great art and fast play. This one is over before you know it, so you can play it a lot in one sitting. My major criticism is that the start worlds and other key cards can really tip the scales in one player's favor. Many people dislike some of the later expansions, but I have all three and prefer to play with all of them.

RATING: 7
This was originally on my wish list for Essen and then dropped off as I had read it was like a more complex san juan. But after having the pleasure of seeing the game and having Tom Lehman (patiently) teach it to us. It immediately shot to my must buy list. Initially the number of icons on the cards, and trying to form any viable strategy on my first game, my head was in a spin, plus we took a lot longer than we would to play once familiarity sets in. While I probably don't recommend it for casual gamers, for the gamers among us, I had a blast! The artwork is stunning, there's a myriad of decisions, and quite frankly, blows san juan right outta the water! I'm looking forward to my next play, with the rating expected to rise.
UPDATE: After purchasing a copy and further plays, it's gone up a point. There are many many different ways to win, plays very quickly, scales well. This game *has* to be one of the most played, wonderful games in the last 5 years IMO. Don't be surprised if it makes the coverted 10 list.

Played this a few times now. Very like San Jaun but with added Sf theme and some game tweaks.looks good too. A good quick game (approx 1 hout for 3 players)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
There is a one-game learning curve to get the mechanics down, and as they say, a lifetime to learn the strategies.  :-)  One of the favorites for gaming night, because games usually are less than an hour (so we often get two in!), and also because it's fun.

One possible downside: little interaction.  Everyone minds their own tableau, so it's solitaire played in a group.

On the plus side, it has a perfect blend of randomness and strategy, and no single strategy always works, so players must adapt to the cards they are dealt.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Race for the Galaxy's simultaneous selection of roles guarantees that the game has much less player interaction than San Juan.

Thumbs up for the theme.  Thumbs down for a space game where players ignore each other completely until someone wins.  In my first (and last) play, I was twenty minutes into the game before I realized that I hadn't looked at my opponents' playing areas even once.

Oh, and I won because I played a powerful point-generating building. Sigh.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Relatively quick card game based on the Puerto Rico game and similar to San Juan. Uses cards for money and goods. Different enough from San Juan to be worth picking up. I rate San Juan slightly better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Played lots of times (with 2 to 4 players - or 5 with a prototype of an expansion). As a fan of San Juan, a former Magic player, and an occasional SF reader, I suppose that I am one of the main targets for this game. The simultaneous action selection makes a large difference with San Juan, although of course one still wants to benefit as much as possible from other players' actions. There is a fair number of strategies, or rather bits of strategies which have to be combined (depending of course on your card draws) in order to win the game. Replayability is very good, and scalability as well (the advanced variant for 2 players adding some more subtlety). Additionally, the artwork is great, which is certainly not needed to make a great game, but definitely doesn't hurt.

As a longtime San Juan player I never was interested in a bigger, more complex San Juan.

But after playing RFTG just once, I think I'm won over. It is more complex, but not unbearably so, and it really does seem to have a lot more variety in strategies and interactions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Quite an entry barrier with the symbol language to learn from scratch. But once that has been mastered, the game is hugely awarding in almost unlimited variability and replayability. A must-have.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Race can be a very tough game to teach new players with all its symbols. However, once everyone gets a grasp of the rules this game will be the go-to quick game for a long time. Decently balanced game with a good amount of luck and strategy makes most game feel fair and close. Recommend buying at least one of the expansions to keep the game fresh.

Race for the galaxy is a real race:
Fast, furious, full of outguessing and outmaneuvering of your opponents. At times it can be a bit unpredictable but good player will enjoy fighting against the odds and will be able to benefit from opponents actions. 

You need a strategy and you need to adopt your strategy to a given situation. Making good tactical decisions is a must but without developing a strong strategy it will not win you many games. 

Bottom line: 0.5-1h full of decisions and galactic empire building.

Seemed like a great game first but then you realize that you're playing a solitaire game even if there's many people participating in the game. It needs more interaction between the players.

Also there are a lot of icons that are not very informative. Some of the icons look alike and that makes the game slightly hard to play.

Fun and quick.  Puerto Rico in space.  I have the Gathering Storm and Rebel vs. Imperium expansions permanently mixed in.

I own Brink of War but haven't used it yet.

I bought a second base game in 2015 to use with the Alien Artifacts arc.  Then I sold Alien Artifacts and picked up Xeno Invasion.  We'll see if that's better.

This feels like a space version of Puerto Rico with even less player interaction and with a freaking lot of things to read. There are so many cards and every card does something different, you have to keep reading them all the time to remember what they do.

I think the learning curve in this game is not very rewarding. I'm not THAT interested in this game to commit so much in learning what every card does, so I'll just pass on this one!

A good mix of randomness because of the cards that have many uses and of strategy. Planning how to build its own ''empire'' is a lot of fun and ask some risk taking in what card to keep or trash. The symbols on the cards are not the most precise but once you've played a few games it gets fast paced and a great deal of fun.

It's a light game once people know the rules, iconography, and basic strategies. But the overall amount of strategy can make simple decisions become extreme analysis paralysis. Designed to be .5 to 1 hours. Can easily become 2+ in certain playthroughs. Overall, plays like a eurogame, but the theme is fun, light, and logical. Love it.

Great game.  I recommend this for light to medium-light multiplayer games under an hour.

Its fun, fast, and easy to learn once you understand that there are only a few symbols used in all of icons with slight variations.

One of my favourites, we play this at dinner quite often. It moves quickly, there are a number of  strategies, and each game feels slightly different. Most of my games have been two player, which does play out a little differently due to the ability to know two of the actions that will occur each round, but I enjoy the three and four player games also. I'm enjoying the new goal tiles added in the Gathering Storm expansion quite a bit.

Solid card game with  interesting mechanics and lots of choices. Looks a bit too complex at first. Too many things to watch, calculate. Rulebook is not well made, like it is for an expansion of a very known game. Also it looks overpriced for such modest box content.

The game is exactly what it calls itself. It's a race. I have played this maybe over 250 times (including online plays). A new player would never win against an experienced one.

Played once in 2009 with hubby and Jerry. We used Jerry's RftG. But I was very lost, couldn't catch what was going on with all the symbols.....this is not an easy game to teach either. Willing to give it another chance since we have just gotten it in a trade from Clement on 3 Jul 10. Have played a few times since 3 Jul 10, glad that we have a better grasp of the symbols and strategies now. Thanks to hubby and Jerry for their patience in teaching me. This game has become our All Time Favourite and will be a keeper. Have sleeved all the cards with the expansions....only missing the Alien Artifacts expansion.

Took me some time to get the various icons down, but the player aid was a great support for me. It was clear from the first games that I didn't have a feel for the right tempo, as I lost those games by about ~10-15 points or so.

I like how you can profit from phase selections other player chose (Something I also like in Puerto Rico) and I like that some have multiple options (like observation having 2 options available, one for keeping more cards while another for searching more deeply for a particular card). I also like the challenge of deciding which cards to discard to play another, or when Exploring a getting nice cards as alternative to what you intended to do.

It seems that foreknowledge of the available cards can help a lot, especially that you know you can search for a particular card or know that you can stop looking for a particular card. Therefore I think experience players have quite the advantage over new player, which might explain the point gap I experienced myself in my first games. Therefore you might want to play more dumb when doing a game with new people the first time if they can get demoralized by this aspect of the game.

San Juan on Spaceships! The theme is so well tightened that you can actually get flashbacks of playing VGA Planets or Master of Orion.

{ P - 2 3 [4] 5 }

Some huge downsides - the luck imbalance of repeatedly drawing cards, excessively solitaire, and the anticipation of opponents' actions (gambling) is somewhat mitigated by fun synergy, great flavor, and wide variance.

Addendum, 1/17/10: Cranked out another hundred or so head-to-head plays (roughly 2-3 minutes per game, just in case that sounded like I was in hibernation) with the Keldon Necropolis A.I. and unfortunately affirmed my inkling that Race is even more of a drawfest than previously thought. Two actions per turn with two players is preferred to avoid bluff, double-bluff annoyances like finagling out a windfall world and hoping an opponent's anticpatory Consume Trade doesn't ruin your plans but said "advanced rules" allow for repeated Consume x2, Produce turns, which can end the game as early as turn 4-5. (e.g. Earth's Lost Colony + Alien Toy Shop, or Alpha Centauri / Ancient Race + any production world + Tourist World) Barring absurd heavy infrastructure draws (perfect military, settling with Replicant/Terraforming Robots, developing with Public Works, Interstellar Bank, Investment Credits), the game is pretty much a matter of lucking into superior production capacity and brutalizing your opponent with Consume x2, Produce. This process ends games so quickly that "traditional" draws with an even split between infrastructure and produce will not routinely see those magic turns 7-8 where exponential expansion doubles their score to the 40-50 range. Alpha Centauri and Ancient Race are the best starting worlds because they are essentially production worlds +3 cards. Specifics:

[b]Banned / Shitlist / Free Win Cards / Whatever[/b]: Alien Toy Shop, Galactic Federation, Terraforming Guild

[b]Second Tier[/b]: Lost Species Ark World, New Earth, Galactic Studios, Tourist World, Galactic Trendsetters, Diversified Economy, Consumer Markets, Mining Conglomerate

04/25/11 - Great first couple games. Still need more practice to get the hang of it.

Update: 05/16/11

After getting more games in, I feel that I begin to understand the mechanics of how everything works and connects. Strategy will be the next thing to learn.

Update: 04/13/12

It's just sitting there on my collection. No one in my group really wants to play it, or explore the nuances of it. It may be too complicated, and it definitely doesn't have too much interaction. Will be thinking about trading it.

Update: 11/07/12

Traded to Wiegrief. Still interested about the game.

I am in the camp of those who love this game. I had no trouble picking up the iconography... nor do I have an issue with the fact that you can not directly effect/interfere with your adversaries cards. Good players will beat inexperienced players - skill is required - plus knowing the cards (all players) makes for a much better game as the players deal with their hands and try to optimize their strategies. Player choices of roles impact on other players... you always have to adjust - dodge and weave - in reaction to role selection - and try to guess what other may do as you select roles. Good challenging game with LOTS of replay value. San Juan with big hairy balls.

EDIT - lowered rating. Since the computer version came out with its excellent AI I rarely play this F2F anymore. Still an excellent game but i dont really bring it to the table anymore.

Another modern great card game, not a deck construction, instead it's all about choosing actions and the cards to play in every precise moment,it has a lot of thinkig and strategy, a really complex card game with equal opportunities to all the players. And you have interaction, not directly, but you can't forget the others are playing. It has a little luck factor when you draw a card, but it's not so important. 

Otro gran juego moderno de cartas, no de construcción de mazos, en vez de eso es todo acerca de elegir acciones y las cartas que jugarás en cada momento preciso, requiere pensar y tiene un montón de estrategia, un juego realmente complejo con iguales oportunidades para todos los jugadores. Y tienes interacción, no directamente, pero no puedes olvidarte de que los demás juegan. Tiene un pequeño factor de suerte a la hora de robar cartas, pero no es relevante.

The perfect CARD GAME, i will play this over any other card game, lots of strategies, no game is ever the same and it has the right amount of luck factor. 

I´ll teach this game to anyone despite the learning curve it has, it´s worth to pull new gamers to this wonderful and elegant game. 

PLUS: you can play this solo, and it´s VERY GOOD!!! 

Love Tom Lehmann designs! They fell mathy but always have some luck elements.

Wow! First game last night was the most fun I've ever had in my life!  I wonder if I could get a game going this evening...

[Update] My days have become vast empty tracts of interstellar time between games of "Race for the Galaxy".

Once, during the first few days, one of my daughters heard me recruiting other players, saying "...it's only about 20 minutes long..." She interrupted: Dad its more like 45 minutes."What?" I thought, "that's not possible!" Anyway it doesn't matter; when can we play again?

[Some months later] Okay I'm finally ready to be reasonable about this rating, and I've taken it down a whole integer. It's not as interactive as Dominion, and that really restricts the range of prospective opponents.  Also, lots of friends find the theme alien (figuratively).  So this isn't going to be in the same pantheon as Dominion

[Another Update]  And up the rating goes again. (I've moved it around between 7 and 9.)  I think most BGG people can agree this is an unqualified classic.  And we've been playing it for so many years with such an array of players that it really deserves its status. One of my all-time favourites.

Much better than I thought it would be. I was completely lost the first game, both in trying to decrypt all the icons and in trying to fashion some sense out of the order-of-operations of all the moving parts. That first game was incredibly challenging to form a strategy and feel like I was making any good decisions... Then the lightbulb went off with the second game, which I enjoyed a great deal. Now I can appreciate the attention to detail and design in integrating all those icons and the interwoven abilities and keyword triggers. Clever, fun and great for lunch-time gaming.

Race for the Galaxy is a fun, fast and highly interactive, in the same sense that Puerto Rico is so interactive. Everything you do impact other players, letting them do the same action.

I must note that I found the iconography very easy to master, and find it equally easy to teach.

I'm very impressed with the design, but sadly the game doesn't get played often enough for us to get very competitive at it, and therefore my desire to play it again has dipped down a tad.

Yeah, I know it's a "race" game. Economic snowball game. Pah! This space cardgame was a HUGE wasted opportunity for an all-conquering space opera experience. Maybe it can't ever be what it wasn't designed to be...

Then why, now, are they adding all the interesting bits in endless expansions? Because they know I'm right!

Too little, too late. At least, for me.

Admirable themic ideas ruined by actual gameplay and iconography.
It has won awards for design, you say?
I say: if you have to look up endlessly what an icon means then it's useless as an icon. That's a simple fact.

I don't want to have to play a game a half-dozen times before I, and everyone around the table, knows what the hell they're doin' without having to glance at a crib sheet.

This is a resource management/ empire building card game.  I started my first game a bit confused but my San Juan experience paid off and got me rolling in the end.  After playing a few more games I appreciate the engine building in this, but if a strategy doesn't present itself in your hand you're probably in trouble...

Still, its incredibly addicting and is even better with an expansion or two thrown in.

Regras mal organizadas (estruturalmente) ou traduzidas (tenho a versão da Galápagos) que torna o jogo de difícil aprendizado, mas complicado são apenas as regras, o jogo é tranquilo, fácil e bom de jogar. Falta interação entre os jogadores.

Wow this really is an amazing card game.  At first it seemed like it was a bit too complex, but after a few plays things started to make sense.

I love the theme, and I think the card art is stellar.  Most of my games have a fantasy theme, so its a very nice change of pace to play a game with a very strong scifi theme instead.  

The game is fairly quick, fun and there seems to be many paths to victory.

I was worried for a long time that Race for the Galaxy would play too similar to San Juan to offer a different experience.  I'm glad that isn't the case.  Beyond a couple of shared mechanics, Race of the Galaxy is a much richer and deeper game in every way.  The initial learning curve is fairly steep, especially since many of the icons and symbols aren't very intuitive, which will require you to refer back to the player aide (which was very well made) very often.

There are plenty of strategies to employ as there are a wide variety of different combinations between the cards.  The simultaneous action selection felt cumbersome at times (especially those prone to AP), but I really like the choices offered as well as the opportunity to bluff your opponents.

Race for the Galaxy is a great game with lots of depth, and I would go as far to say that why play San Juan with you have this.

Update #1: Highest score ever achieved was tonight at 62, it was a combination of Alien world and Military strength.  This has to be the best synergy I've tried, even better than the consume x2/produce engine (which was 43).

Update #2: While I have been playing this a lot, it's all due to the request by others.  I myself, while enjoy the game, will most likely never ask to play since I prefer to try new stuff instead.  The scores haven't been consistent, in fact, I'm at an all-time low at the moment.  The randomness of the draw just hasn't been kind to me, and although it doesn't bother me per se, it does reaffirm the negative feeling that there are just a lot of useless cards once you've decided on a strategy.  I know it's unavoidable in a game with shared deck, but nevertheless it still seem like a poor design.

Update #3: For some reason the 2-player variant felt pretty different and in some instances even more strategic.  It did sort of breathed new life into the game for me, and I think would be something I don't mind playing at all (usually I avoid stuff restricted to just 2-player, having only one opponent isn't very appealing for me).

Update #4: Took off 0.5 from my original rating as of 4/8/08.  I will still play it when it is requested, and I do find that my strategies are more refined.  However, the game plays pretty much the same time after time.  It is inevitable as a non-collectible card game, and I do not see any viable variant to make the experience different.  I'm not sure if that will cause the score to further devalue as time goes on, but the newness to it has definitely wore off.

This is our first "heavy" card game and now I'm not sure I could go back to Dominion as it seems so simple compared to this (strategy wise). 10+ play throughs in a week and still liking it!

This game sat on my shelf for a couple years without many plays. After playing a few hours against the Keldon AI I started to appreciate the strategic depth.

This is, as many have said, a more intricate cousin of San Juan.  I'm itching to play it some more, but I currently have some concerns about how opportunistic (namely, luck of the draw) it might be.  Examples:  I mined for cards a lot, and throughout the whole game, drew merely two - yes, two - cards that could provide military.  So, clearly, I couldn't pursue military.  I drew only two cards that could provide genes, and one of those was exclusively a windfall planet.  I had two shots at alien tech, one at novelty, and enough rare elements cards to do some stuff with them.  In other words, I had constant tough decisions, but I had extremely little choice about what I could pursue.  It seemed that the best strategy was to specialize in something, and cash in on that; however, what if you end up with a smattering of everything?  Remember, I was drawing a good number of cards, thanks in part to my developments - little thanks to my poor production potential.

Nonetheless, I suspect that with experience, you see clearer paths through the chaos.  I yearn for that experience.

Okay, so I became interested in this when I found out that it was like San Juan.  The hype machine did the rest of the work.  I've only got in one play so far, but it was enough to interest me.  My wife...not so much.  She wasn't a fan of the multiple icons on all the cards.  I am pretty sure that later on, we will pull it out again and eventually it will see more plays.

Update:  I play this about once a week now with a buddy of mine.  He has mentioned that it might be his favorite game of all time.  To me that is quite the statement after only a handful of plays, but I won't deny that I enjoy it.  I still feel like I have just scratched the surface with this one.

Update:  I had been dreading teaching this to my in-laws.  My brother-in-law bought it for them without knowing much about it.  I was worried because of all the icons.  It actually went well.  They still struggle with it though.

Intriguing. The rules are very simple, but the iconography makes it difficult to teach - and play for the first time. The icons are clear, but feel like a mess at first. Newbies catch on fast, though. The game can be fast and has a high random factor, but there is strategic depth and awesome combinations. More than anything, there's always a need to play one more game. Very addictive. Bad luck with card draws suck, of course, but card games are like that I suppose.

Rating might rise in the future if the game keeps holding the interest.

Love the fact that you often rely on the other players choices... And a wrong choice often ends with the other/or you winning the lot! :D

Great fun

I finally got around to playing this. It was just too fussy to play for our group and won't be back at the table ever. I'll be offloading my copy. I had so looked forward to this but I couldn't get into this. And the feeling is made worse by the fact our group loves Roll for the Galaxy. 

The rating isn't fair to the game for those who don't mind the fussiness but for me it's a 3. I won't play this again. Doubt anyone in our group will, either.

The iconography doesn't bother me, I found it intuitive and easy to follow.  

The game itself is pretty boring though.  It's very much multiplayer solitaire, and I just didn't find it interesting.

Az első játék után még erősen fogalmam sincs róla, de játszunk majd még vele és, ha letisztult, adok rá pontot. A látvány nem tetszik egyébként, nagyon rideg, nagyon semmilyen, a Star Realms színes-szagos kártyái jobban bejönnek nekem.

A látvány továbbra sem oké, de a 2. játék után azért szépen kezd összeállni a kép. Még akarok vele játszani, jó lesz ez.

Our new favourite 2-player game – fast, science fiction and (brilliant) economy – a rare and perfect blend. One can really appreciate the design so I don't see why the designer tends to be a bit sensitive and hot-headed when polemicizing on BGG. I would even go as far as to say that this is the greatest game design-wise I ever encountered, although that would probably be unfair since it is a derivation of sort from San Juan/Puerto Rico. Also – hadn't had any problems with symbols and teaching, didn't even had card-specific dilemmas as was the case with Android Netrunner.

I could play this one whole night - such a perfect game.

After 100+ Plays: Well, I've played this over 100 times now before finally getting around to rating it, so I think my opinion is pretty firm by now.  I was unimpressed after my first play, thinking a would prefer to stick with San Juan.  Once I finally got used to the symbols and the flow of the game, I began to really love it.  It was my most played game of 2008, and will almost certainly be my most played game of 2009.  Every game begins with a choice of strategic paths, and the more you play the more nuanced the strategy becomes.  It's not just a choice of military or production, but of choosing from the many flavors of those two main branches. 

After 500+ Plays: This has remained one of my absolute favorites.  The expansions are excellent, and a crucial element in my continuing to play with such regularity.  As long as quality expansions continue to be released I'm happy to play this about 100 times a year.  But, even if they stopped making expansions, I see myself playing around 50 games a year for the foreseeable future.

There are a lot of good things to be said about this game. However, the main flaw, which keeps this game from being played at our table is the possible imbalance - or "phase 10" dilemma. 

We had a number of games, where one or two players just had lucky draws in the very beginning of the game, while others just didn´t get the cards that matched their basic strategy for a few turns. The bad part about this: it is very unlikely to catch up on a slow start during the course of the game, making the outcome very predictable. And it just takes away too much, when half of the players mentaly leave the game early, because there is hardly any chance of winning for them.

I've played less than 1000 games of RftG, so I'm probably not yet qualified to form an opinion. At least that's the perception from many people who are so serious into this game. While that's obviously tongue-in-cheek, it points to something important about it. After 100s of plays, it is still exciting and fresh. Like a game like 7 Wonders the iconography can turn people off, but after this is internalized, it quickly becomes wonderful. I think it plays best with the 2-player advanced rules where each person chooses two roles, but up to 4 will be great.

Played this game a few times with my girlfriend's, mom's, husband's, brother's, nephew and his wife, and loved every game. It moves really fast, and feels really close and intense to the very end when you're never quite sure who's going to win. Will play any chance I get.

We purchased this game because it came highly recommended from a friend who really knew their stuff when it comes to games. However, it looked much more complicated than most of what we had been playing (Ticket to Ride, Pandemic, etc.) so it sat on the shelf for a while. When we finally got around to trying it out, we were a bit daunted at first but ended up picking up the rules far faster than we thought we would and Race for the Galaxy is now one of our favorite games! There are tons of layers of strategy to this game and many ways that you can play it.

"I don't like this game." was all I could say about it after the first 2 play through, then My GF sat me down and helped me learn what I was doing wrong and how to fix it. Then I had a lot of fun.  
I really don't like hype trains, but this game is actually good, sooo Toot toot.

В эту игру очень хочется научиться играть. Ничего не понимаешь, тупишь, а потом... постепенно... начинаешь осознавать - ага, победные очки, ага, товары надо обменивать на них в свой ход, ага, много строить не нужно, ага, оптимизировать 2 и 3 фазы надо в начале игры только... ага... ага... 

9 Игра нравится всё больше и больше. Так получилось, что играл после знакомства с Доминионом. Доминион в один прекрасный момент надоедает - см ниже почему. Она пока что - нет. Единственный минус - не для девочек.

8.05 Слишком гиковая игра, а с гиками можно поиграть и во много других игр.

[b]Retrospective[/b]:

When I first purchased this game in 2009 I was naïvely expecting it to be something else, perhaps a confrontational game similar to Magic: The Gathering. This probably explains why I had such a hard time explaining it to everyone. Fast forward to 2017 after playing San Juan and more Euros since 2009 and suddenly it just made sense. While I think it's mechanically better than San Juan, it just isn't as thematically appealing to me. I'll have to play it again to be able to score it properly.

Excellent card game with a great flavor, good art and a brisk pace. Might not be ideal for you if you're always playing with a different group since the icons (while excellent) take some getting used to.

Own the first two expansions (I never liked all that war nonsense - it's too complicated for what it adds).

"Never sell or trade games shelf" - This game is always coming out to play. I have all the expansions but I feel the new rules in every one of them detract from the original rules. I mainly just combine the first three expansion cards with the base game. Highly recommended.

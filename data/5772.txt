{1 play • 6 player} Just okay Personal Preference-ish game.  Suffers from the same problem a lot of these types of game do: unbalanced category draws.  The fun for me is when the choices are tough and revealing, but when you've got something like: Creativity, Family, Tanning Salon... you know that Tanning Salon is last, effectively reducing your choices in the game, which is where I think all the fun is... and there's really no discussion coming from Family vs. Creativity, as most people will understand that either is an "acceptable" first choice.  The extra wrinkle of trying to rank the cards how you think OTHERS will is also not nearly as interesting to me as having to rank them as YOU think they should be ranked.  I maybe learn something about you if YOU rank them; I don't really gain as much insight (and fun) if you're trying to match 4+ other players.

This game should required in every house as the game to play with family.  Light and deep at the same time - the game can be played by anyone at nearly any age.  A solid game for the "everyone crowd". [GTI: TGSL]

Nice family or non-gamer game.  One of the nice thing is that you can determine when the game is over.

RATING: 9
A nice "guess what the other person prefers" party game, in the genre of say anything and/or gifttrap. Although simplistic, this one might also provide grounds for some interesting discussions.

RATING: 6
One of the best party, couples games out there. Works with different age groups. Similar to the Newlywed game only by the fact that you are trying to see what you know about your spouse. Works as a group think game if you are not w/ couples.

RATING: 6
This is an interesting game of ranking priorities.  Unfortunately, many of the cards have very serious items on them.  This results in more serious conversation, rather than the light funny feel that you get from most party games.  But it can also work as a good team-building exercise for businesses, helping coworkers get to know one another better.

Fun party game, like a less creative "What Were You Thinking?" with a bit more structure.  If the cards are right, and the group is right, it could lead to some thought-provoking discussions.

This game is destined to become a classic, spread by word of mouth.  Jump on the band wagon now.  I play What's It To Ya? with my family more than any other game.  We've tried Settlers and Bang!, but nothing matches the simple fun of WITY?.  I am forced to withhold a 10 from this game, because the rules require some modification to achieve a truly strategic and satisfying experience.  I recommend playing with teams of 2 using one player as a leader in each round.  If you play this way, you will see that this game clearly deserves a rating of 10.  The modest components only serve to make WITY? even more endearing.

RATING: 6
Fun party game, but loses its charms after awhile. It can be funny and you can learn interesting things about your friends at the same time. It's definitely best played in partnerships (though the unofficial variant where you play individually with one person as the boss and the rest as guessers is great too.) Playing in a group of people who know each other well is more frantic and competitive, but it can also be a good way to learn about people you don't know very well.

Recommended because it's cheap but don't expect it to last.

Update: In some ways I think GiftTrap is just a better, more appealing version of this.

RATING: 9
Components: Simple cards.  The cards lettered A-E are a clever way to achieve the ranking, but unfortunately it becomes visually cluttering to have so many lettered cards turned face up on the table at once; and it is difficult to quickly find the most common choice.  Good variety in the topic cards.  Despite the large quantity of topic cards I can see that after only a very few games a player could have played through them all.  However, I think the same cards turning up in different combinations will lead to other interesting comparisons, more so than does reusing cards in Apples to Apples.

Experience: Great fun.  I've only played with an odd number of people. With each person voting sincerely, there is in effect no strategy, and the winner is the person whose opinion happens most to match that of the collective.  Not much of a game in this regard. Still, it's always fun to rank one's preferences, and it was fun to see how it compared with the preferences of others, and to have quick debates about the relative worth of the topics. I've also played where one person ranks, and the others try to guess what they ranked. Again not much of a game, but interesting, and with a hint of Scruples, where we argue with the active player about their choices.

Five items are placed on the table --things like "Hope", "Garbage Collectors" and "Underwear". Now everyone has to rank them in order of importance. Players get points when they match the rankings of other players. Playable in partnerships or as individuals trying to match the majority, What's It To Ya? is a great game for generating plenty of laughs and discussion.

Played two ways so far, match the majority and What's it to ___? matching an individual player.  Both worked well to get discussion going and generated a lot of laughs and shock.  The scoring system could be more exact, as you might have the correct ranking except for 1 card but score 0 points.  But it doesn't need to be any more complicated for the light party game that it is.

This game is interesting with people of different ages and different outlooks.  If you play with friends that you know really well, the game will probably be fairly predictable.  Given a random set of five ideas, you will have some idea of where they are going to rank them.  As an example, in games with my girlfriend and her son, her and I would generally be pretty close, whereas his ideas from the age perspective were a lot different than ours.  So we generally could only pick each other and keep getting points.  This is not always the case, but group composition is fairly important to have fun with this game.

If you don't care about the score, this is a fun way to get people to talk about different ideas.  It's fun berating someone for ranking things a certain way, and is an interesting way to drive some discussion.  As a game, it's pretty plain, but as an experience, it's not too bad.  It's not really a trivia game so much as a discussion game, or a bluffing game if you want to try and win.  It's diverse, and is one I wouldn't be averse to playing more.

An interesting game of ranking how your game partner values widely disparate things ... and then guessing what order you rank thinks. Best played with a group of couples ... you will see who are most in sync with each other. Do you value glass ahead of charity or chocolate doughnuts?

This went over very well for a group of non-gamers.  We played the variant where one person is the "boss" and everyone tries to match his rankings.  Dealt out a hand of cards to players and part of the fun was each player picking a card from their hand to give to the "boss" to rank. 

Replayability is a problem with the same group of people.

RATING: 8
This is a fabulously simple social game centered about people's personal preferences, values and views with life & the world/universe.  It's a casual, light party-game where you learn about everyone's personal value system (makes for great conversations while still playing a game!).  It's a "getting-to-know-you" game that's fun with partners.  Heck, I think it will work great in teams of more than two.  The great thing about it is that you can easily play this with strangers (serving as a great ice breaker).  I do wish that the quantity of cards were greater (need more cards or more words to value!  Did anyone say expansion?).  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Enjoyable party game we play a bit differently when we don't play with partners in that each person takes a turn being "it" and everyone seeks to match that person.  Replayability may be limited but there are quite a few cards available in play.

Not bad for only $8, but really needs a larger deck of cards.  We quickly went through the deck after only a few plays.  Even with a reshuffled deck, it just isn't as interesting to see the same words over and over again.  On the positive side, we did learn a few revealing things about each other by playing this game.

This is a party game (which I am usually not fond of). It is as easy to teach and play as Apples to Apples but holds my interest longer. Where A2A is often a lot of laughs, this game initiates real discussions. It is excellent to use with high school kids.  For a self-published game this is much better than average quality. The price is right and you get a very good party game.

Great after dinner game while folks are still sitting at the table.  Need to play with folks who know each other relatively well.  Or play to find out which couples know their spouse better.

Update (Feb.'09): Also great in class.  Pick a student and everone needs to guess his order.  Bound to get a few students who get all 5 right and that's cool.

Welcome to the machine.  Plug into the group think.  Those that have their own concept of what the world is like will lose; those in the hive mind or are good enough at pretending will win.  

If the game is about learning about each other, then why penalize people for revealing themselves.  I honestly don't see how this is even a game, it is more just comparing notes.   Not much of what you do is going to make a difference in whether you win or lose.

As a social exercise it is entertaining for about 15 minutes, then it overstays its welcome after three rounds.

Nice party game where played in pairs of players.
You and your partner have guess one another's preferences over many different things. 

For example you may have to list from most important to least important the following: Cheese, Religion, TV, Pain, Cell Phones.

[New World Games 2006 edition] {party, social; voting, partnership} It's a nice social game to let couples or a group of friends to know each other better. It's funny to know a couple does not know each other's preferences very well.

I prefer the partnership game to the group game. The group game tends to be group think, rather than giving a chance to let players understand each other better.

It has a strong English barrier. Localization is needed for better game experiences.

Replayability may be a problem. There are 200 cards. It should be enough for several plays.

Not a very good party game, there are much better ones available (like Taboo, Pit, Werewolf).  A set of cards is laid out which list a random assortment of items, and players secretly prioritize all of the items in the list in terms of importance.  You score based on matching what the most people said, and then lay out a new set of items.  It makes for some amusing comparisons since the items range from the mundane to the profound, but would overstay its welcome relatively quickly and is rather arbitrary.

A 'must have' game, that neatly bridges the gap from computer screen to table-top... to fill an evening around a table-top with fun! Could this be the next King of Tokyo?!

Seems like a neat and whimsical area control and tile laying game. Might be hard to develop a strategy if the game is too dice heavy, but could be appealing because of the art.

An excellent kids game, with interesting decisions, strategic options, and even a tech tree... for kids. I seriously would have loved this game when I was 10 or 11.

Unfortunately, this is not a very good game for grown-ups, especially gamers: the high degree of luck, not just on die rolls but also (and more importantly) on what you find on the backs of forest tiles, means that there is no real way to control your fate in the game. As forest tiles dry up, the game also slows down, and can take far longer than it should for the game to end.

Very cute and smoothplaying, light adventure game. Relaxing and competitive at the same time. Great as a family game, but with children I would leave out the pvp aspect.

Played the online version over and over again.
It took some time until I understood some of the deeper tactical + strategic aspects of the game.
Cannot wait to get my Kickstarter version.

Played the online version once and loosely grasped the concepts.... Then played again, and again, and again. I realized that this game has rather simple mechanics you can grasp after a playthrough or two, but which are very difficult to master since there is so much variation with character builds and maps. Don't own it yet, but I've played the online version a ton (which will arguably be shell of an experience compared to the actual game itself.) This game instantly went to the top of my anticipation list for board games this year. Simple and awesome.

I have played the demo about 20-25 times now. I simply love it. To illustrate it's charm, I'll tell you I played a game with my wife. She NEVER plays board games and she actually enjoyed herself this time. Was easy to understand for her. This was monumental. I can't really overstate how much she doesn't like playing board games. But I coaxed her into playing this one and she was engaged in about two minutes and even ended up winning by two teeth!

If you are at all doubting the game, give the demo a try. It only takes a couple games to realize the amazing depth and variety of the game between all the different characters and extremely balanced and unique mechanics. I'm surprised this game hasn't caught fire as it's been done so well.

RATING: 3.5
Interesting artwork. Gameplay is simple, easy to teach and learn. However, it gets repetitive quite quickly and does not hold up to repeated plays despite the variable board setup. Very luck dependent; for instance a player can obtain an advantageous item by drawing the right tile and then getting the right result on the die roll. The only other ways to obtain an item are to get certain cards in your hand and then hopefully be able to get the right food and then make your way to the right tile or head to the underworld and open the treasure chest and roll dice. There is no real way to mitigate luck or slow an opponent; runaway leaders happen fairly often. Optimal strategies are few and obvious, but you are at the mercy of fortune as to whether you can implement them. 

I like games that have some degree of luck and that feature dice, but this game has too much luck and little else.

From the online BETA the mechanics look pretty solid for a family boardgame.

And the real game is even better. Top notch components with beautiful art. Very sound gameplay and several different strategies that can be applied for wining the game.

Ein Produkt aus der Schweiz,  über Kickstarter erfolgreich gefoundet und vertrieben - das eigentlich viel bekannter sein sollte als es ist. Wunderschön gemachtes Dungeon-Crawler "Light" für alle Altersklassen. Trotzdem (oder gerade deswegen) ein super Spiel.

Is currently a canceled kickstarter, but an interesting and beautiful looking game. Supposedly re-booting the kickstarter once they figure out how to provide the game with cheaper shipping to the US.

New kickstarter: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/heldentaufe/heldentaufe-the-adventure-board-game-for-the-whole

Kickstarter re-started the project and it got funded.
Supposed to be out in the US around November 2015. Look for it at retailers if still interested in this once it comes out.

Very nice game. Kid-friendly dungeon type (improve your skills, go in the cave, fight monsters and get the treasure). Simple gameplay, very nice components, great visual appeal.

RATING: 7
Very funny game, specially if you play it "a la Munchkin", trying to spoil every effort of the other players to win while you try to achieve that same goal. Perhaps a few mechanics could be polished, and we did not like the positioning of one of the monsters in the underworld, which doesn't make room for the players who aren't attacking to strategize against the one who is. Art is gorgeus —not surprising coming from Matthieu Leysenne and the overall feeling is more or less the same —although they have nothing to do one to each other— that you get when playing 'Jamaica': that of a gorgeous game which is shy of a good gateway one.

[KS] This game makes me think of Talisman simplified and reduced to 60-90 min. After half a dozen plays with 3-5 people I think the monsters are a bit under-powered but that's my only significant complaint. They should at least have 6 actions a turn. Otherwise there are a few rules ambiguities but nothing crucial.

People at my gaming group ask to play it, and once you know the game it only takes about an hour (a little longer with 5). It's simple with whimsical art that adds to the fun factor.

Még nem mondanék ítéletet, a pontszám felfele és lefele is mehet, de kell még egy játék, mert az elsőben nagyon beragadtam. Túl korán mentem le harcolni a szörnyekkel, így buktam minden cuccomat, innentől kezdve viszont már csak asszisztáltam a játék hátralévő részében. Hiába egy könnyed kaland az egész akár kisebbeknek is, erre nagyon kell figyelni, mert frusztráló játék lesz belőle. Ami elsőre egyértelmű, hogy nagyon szép a játék, jók a komponensek és tényleg jó hangulata van egésznek.

Probabilmente il mio gioco preferito, lo gioco sempre volentieri anche perchè grazie alla scatola perfettamente ordinata i tempi di setup sono davvero brevi, circa 5 minuti, anche la partita non dura molto, circa 1 ora e mezza , e ovviamente il gioco è divertentissimo, è un gioco di avventura compressato, è tutto semplificato, ma non per questo banale, c'è tutto! esplorazione, raccolta risorse, miglioramento dell'equipaggiamento del proprio personaggio, creazione di pozioni magiche, scontri con mostri e anche con gli altri giocatori, i mostri sconfitti tornano in vita più potenti di prima (come se imparassero dalle proprie sconfitte) e più diventano forti più forniscono punti vittoria se sconfitti , ci sono anche delle carte avventura/quest che si possono cambiare spesso offrendo vari modi di fare punti, insomma c'è davvero tutto e la grafica è davvero stupenda! onestamente non saprei cos'altro chiedere ad un gioco, consigliatissimo a tutti, anche perchè ,nonostante tutte le caratteristiche che ho elencato, il gioco è davvero facile da spiegare e da giocare, quindi godibile anche per i più piccoli! grazie per avere creato questo gioco, sicuramente meriterebbe più rilievo nel mercato dei giochi da tavolo!

Suffers from some flaws, but in spite of them, it's a game that I both enjoy, and I'm slightly nostalgic of. While it is playable with a wide range of people, it's realistically only playable with 3, or 4. Second, you have to replace the money chits with hidden coins because the chits are useless. I find the game is way too fiddly otherwise. Last, it's a game that sort of suffers from a Munchkin-style problem more so than most games with tenuous political allegiances (and degradation of said teams); the game continues until someone's just not able to stop you (which is why I recommend it at 3p). It's funny and interactive, and there is something appealing about both of those, and I think that's sort of what makes it attractive to me.

One of the most amazing (and funny) games I have ever played--this was a gateway game from Milton-Bradley to 'boutique' gaming for me. This deluxe edition had the cardboard money, which I hate, but the updated artwork in color is nice =) Fnord!

Great memories playing this game in my freshman dorm instead of studying for finals.  It only works great if you are playing with a group that knows the cards and can control any run-away players.  The best part of this game is the player interaction, threats, bluffs, and negotiation.  It is a horrible 2 player game.  My wife will never play it again.

I had a good enough time, but generally I'd rather be playing about 40 other games before this one. As far as Steve Jackson goes this is one of the better ones, but I'm just not into this style of game. After one playing (and one win!) I'm going to take my time before trying it again.

Juego de cartas de crear tu red de poder (red de cartas) con pasta de por medio, y atacando a otros para debilitarles o quitarles sus cartas. Cada una es un "grupo social" de lo más variopinto xd Interacción por doquier, mucha mala leche xd, un poco de gestión de pasta y espacial y un poco de caos. Juego curioso, falta probarlo más. Recomendable 4-5 jugadores como mucho, típico donde hasta que te llega el turno, con más jugadores pierde.

With the RIGHT people there isn't a game more fun than Illuminati. Backstabbing at its best. My personal opinion is that, this game should be played with only one expansion. With the both expansions (Y2K and BFD) together in play the game tends to drag on longer.

2016-01-29
After not playing Illuminati for 6 years, I got rid of it. It was a tough decision, since it was the game that brought me into the hobby.

The main reasons why Illuminati did not hit the table stem form the high levels of abstraction in the game. The rules are quite hard to explain and you're better be prepared to help the others throughout the whole game (especially in attack and defense). Moreover, you're constantly craning your neck over the table to read the small print on the cards, which is easy to miss.

Another annoying quality is the unpredictable playing time. A game can drag on for hours, or it can be over in 30 minutes. I also highly recommend not to mix more than one expansion at a time into the deck. With two expansions there is just too much cardboard in the deck, and often for rounds and rounds you're just drawing the weakest of cards that nobody wants. The highlights of the game are the fierce battles over the strongest cards, after all.

However, I do miss the moments when everyone was allied with everybody against everyone else. And the look at the face of players when their allies turned against them. With its obvious flaws, Illuminati might not be of a good game design, but it creates memories.

Rarely hits the table, and we always have to go over the rules fresh again when we pull it out.  I like the theme, (the furries are controlling... NASA!  In conjunction with... hippies!  With... mind control lasers!  To take over the world!) but the actual mechanics of play don't grip me much.

RATING: 3
The theme/humor is just about my favorite for any game ever but the endgame is interminable and it has massive balance issues, mostly due to the trickle of groups that comes out. There are too many cards to assume you'll ever even see a certain one and stuff like Orbital Mind Control Lasers is just so good it either gets destroyed out of spite or everyone fights over it. 

I've had a lot of fun experiences with this game in the past but I don't see playing it much anymore. I would love to see a reworking of this with modern design sensibilities (which will never happen). 

This is one of those games where whoever tries to win first will lose and it's just a grinding slog of leader bashing.

I was a huge fan of this game, back in the day, though I have not played it much recently. It is best with many players, but DO NOT use the cheating rules, it just makes the game too tiresome, trying to watch everything everyone is doing, not being able to look away from the table, etc. The old play-by-mail version that Flying Buffalo ran was great too, though not quite the same game.

I've been looking at this one for a while.  It was suggested that I try it before I buy.  I did and I'm glad.  The rules seemed complex (I was being "taught") and found the system worked best for those who had memorized the cards.

I don't think this one will be going into my "game bag" as part of my collection.  It just didn't sit well.  Then again I could just be bitter 'cus I got my butt kicked...

This was one of the first 'modern' card games I played, many years ago, in between bouts of AD&D. Really fun associations between the organisations. It's very take-that and cut-throat, and a player can get shut out very suddenly which is sometimes a pain in what can be a long game.

RATING: 8.4
A classic for a reason, it was fun when I was younger and reconnecting with it has also been entertaining. Control a bunch of outrageous groups and attack others for various purposes. Each Illuminati faction has its own goals and special abilities, and the Advanced rules allow you to play them hidden, which is probably better than Face-Up. There is also a social element here, with diplomacy, offering other players assistance to pursue your own goals, and a fairly intuitive system for how you lay out your Power Structure, gather income, etc. The DNA is now in everything from Game of Thrones: The Board Game to Sheriff of Nottingham. For a reason.

30 Plays: I played this game repeatedly back in my highschool days and loved it. The game itself is simple enough after the first play. I love the theme and the concept urged me to read the books. There's more to this game than the mechanisms. There's a whole metagame going on that's argueably more important than the actual game in terms of victory. Without support and allies, winning becomes very difficult. Expect backstabbing and leader bashing, as they help to balance the asymmetrical illuminati and power groups.

This game always plays the same way: First, everyone gets into the spirit, and thinks it will be fun.  Next, the game devolves into a stop the person in the lead game.  Finally, someone gets bitter, then we quit, never finish the game, and vow to never play it again.  I think I will take our advice, and never play it again.  Maybe it was reflective of a certain time period in gaming history where this was the best there was, but compared to what there is out there now, this is just junk.  I would rather play Giganten than this smelly poo of a game.  Great theme, and funny cards so that is worth at least .5 points, other than that, I will NEVER play this piece again.  I hates it!

You will kill a few hours with this one and have a blast doing it!

Played this in October 2007 and still enjoy this game as much as ever.  To me this is one of the best 5 player games out there.    The mechanics allow the leader to be kept with the pack, so in general the games are very close.  When someone wins, more than one player at the table will explain how they were going to win on their next turn.

We played this in high school and it was fun back then, but ten years after that it is not my type anymore. The game allows too much ganging up on one player and direct conflict, which can be based on out-of-game reasons. Has the typical Steve Jackson -games humor.

Increase the power of your secret society in an effort to take over the world, or at least the Semiconscious Liberation Army.  A fun game if your players do not keep grudges.  The mechanics of the power structure are neat.  The game can drag with a lot of players.

RATING: 6
A high-school favorite that hasn't aged terribly.  Your shadowy conspiracy needs to take over the world before anybody else's can.  Or, team up and go for a joint victory -- if you can trust the shifty sonuvabitch....

It's swingy as hell; bad luck with either the cards or the dice can utterly shaft you, and there's not much you can do about it.  And it has some balance issues.  (The Bavarians have by far the best special power AND the most sensible custom victory condition.)  Still, keep your expectations modest and you can have a good time playing it.

Rules take a long time to explain, and it's often hard to talk people into playing this one.  Also, it seems like win conditions are not equal across the various groups, which makes it frustrating if you get stuck, for example, being the Gnomes of Zurich.  That said, the cards are fun, and it provokes interesting conversations.

RATING: 4
Entertaining when I played, but a pretty big luck fest and, in true Steve Jackson form, you win by being a complete jerk to your fellow players.  I don't mind PvP but it just seems more mean-spirited in Illuminati for some reason, i.e. you can really, ~really~ screw someone over who makes a misstep and knock them out of the game.  Playable, but I'd play many other games first.

Game rating based on too many bad 3-player games. need to get a couple of 4+ player games to get a real sense of the game.

EDIT: Finally got a 5-player game in. I just don't think this game has dated particularly well. Its mechanics are clunky, linear and very steve jackson/80s. All their games are the same - collect stuff, smash the leader until someone else manages to win. Munchkin is the same, Chez Geek is even the same...

I really wonder what this would look like if it were made now, by someone other than the formulaic Steve Jackson. Given the type of card mechanics seen in games like Innovation or Race for the Galaxy, a game about the spooky secret masters who control the world could be so much better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The rules are just an excuse for the theme. I.e. the atmosphere of the game is where its strength lies. I don't think I have ever played this game competitively: the chance of winning is just an excuse to create a narrative. Trying to actually win the game is almost ludicrous considering the rules. You might as well draw lottery tickets at the start of the game. Saying that, I generally have a lot of fun playing this game.

Really not my kind of game.  Too much card luck, dice luck and "take that".  The brinksmanship fun of secret victory conditions is overshadowed by the turtling and 3-player syndrome... A attacks B but then A is weak and gets attacked by C.  --- Secret roles, social deduction (early/infancy) and bluffing... also, parts of this game were imbalanced and annoying; especially the Munchkin-like, keep-everyone-else-from-winning aspect that makes the game drag on for far too long.

RATING: 7
This is probably one of the better games from Steve Jackson Games I've ever played.  This is fun to play with friends as there are tons of deals, negotiation and screw-age.  It's too bad it plays longer than it should and some of the great humor in the cards are now way out of date.  I'm not a big fan of the small cardboard bills it comes with in this edition.  It's long overdue for a new version.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I like the idea behind the theme, but the game fell flat for me after one play. The game length is too long for what it is. If the game would have been shorter and the rules more streamlined I would have kept this game.

Did not think I would find a game I liked less than Munchkin.  But this game was it.  It was to long and it was just not very easy to play.  It has a ton of down time, plus it actually has player elimination.  Talk about just killer if you are an hour into the game and you are eliminated.  Now you have to sit and wait for the other players to finish which could be another hour or two.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Ok game from SJG that shares a lot of the same appeal as Munchkin (referential humor, backstabbing, negotiation) and the same pitfalls (humor fades, kingmaker, 2nd place always wins, too random).  Has better mechanics though, and the fact that cheating is encouraged in the rules means you have to watch everyone more carefully and keeps you more involved.

Plays logged for this game incorporate Geek Joe Dizzy's rules for a shorter game and are generally 2-player.  Will likely try switching to INWO for 2-player if I can figure out how those rules work.  Update:  dropped rating from 6.5 to 4 -- I like the idea of a conspiracy game, but this just doesn't feel like a conspiracy game when I play it.

RATING: 10
An epic game of power struggle and direct player interaction. As such it takes the right group to be fun.

I love how you can take sides in any conflict and contribute in tiny amounts to influence the outcome.

In the beginning of the game everybody tries to gain control of powerful groups to be in a good position during the mid/endgame. As soon as somebody starts to be close to fulfill their private or the standard victory condition everybody pulls together to stop him. It's not entirely unlike Munchkin, but less dependent on drawing the right cards.

It sometimes feels like luck is the dominating factor in determining the winner, but it's much more than that: knowing when to attack and when to hold back, spotting weak targets and dangerous opponents and, most importantly, table talk to rally the players against a leader and to distract from yourself and your plan. It can take quite a few rounds until somebody manages to outbid all others on their final attack, or to make a surprise attack that nobody is prepared to stop, but the struggle towards this moment is what makes this game great for me.

I rate this game relatively low not because it's a bad game, but because it requires so much strategy, scheming, and backstabbing, that I don't often have the mental energy to play it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This was my gateway into gaming.  My only issue is that the game almost always lasts about 30 minutes longer than you really want to play.  That, and it is like every other Steve Jackson game, where the eventual winner is the person who was in 2nd or 3rd place, and sneaks a victory when every one is tapped out from stopping the last big "game winning" play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Can be played with 2 or 3 players, but gameplay suffers badly.  I don't like the player interaction much: wait for someone to get close to winning, then beat him down....repeat.  The game needs some other rules to regulate (and encourage) cooperation.

Edge publishing Spanish (and also French) editions update the artwork from this Steve Jackson Games classic. Wish they had done all the expansion cards - language not an impediment for my purposes - not too hard to translate and use with original English rules.

My comments on Illuminati in general:

"Recalled from gaming days gone by, Illuminati, in the totality of it's releases and variants, is the concept which made me give gaming another try. Can't get better subject matter or mechanics. It all but forces reflection on and conversation about modern western society. Should be far more popular than it is. The original 1987 deluxe edition could seriously stand a reprint (with the original art, which makes it far more accessible than the much more aggressive and less playful later Deluxe, Bavarian Fire Drill, Y2K, Mutually Assured Distraction and INWO.)"

Have the Spanish version thanks to http://www.boardgamegeek.com/user/rafaelgg - thanks again y muchas gracias Rafa!

I have played this game with friends for years It has a fairly steep learning curve for new people, it's best to try to play with some people that do know how to play it. If that's not an option, just take your time and have fun with it! The first few games will go pretty slowly as you refer to the rule book numerous times just to see what you can and can't do, but as soon as you learn it, it flows very well and you will have a great time.

Nothing is better in my gaming world than cutting shady deals - and then not going through with them once you've reaped the benefits. 

Illuminati is full of this (or is when I play it) and the opportunity to mess up everybody else's careful gameplay is always there. I've lost more friends through this than any other game, and seen more stuff thrown, boards overturned etc than would normally be expected. I just keep on running out of people who'll play it with me.

This game is bit overwhelming as it progresses, with all the money-management required.

Once everyone throws all their money at him, they have nothing left to prevent the next guy from winning.

RATING: 9
SJGames receive a lot of flak for their titles, but Illuminati is truly one of their top releases. Fantastic theme, with balanced mechanics, great underlying humour, and with a high level of player-interaction, as you build your chain of control as wide and strongly as possible whilst paying to have others' networks attacked. Plus, the game permits anything to be done, so long as the player is not caught, adding a whole level of meta-play. I love this game, as do my family.

After a few rounds the calculations for control become cumbersome and offputting - it works if you just trust people to work out the money and bonuses correctly but its easy to miss the odd +2 here and there.

Illuminati is an awesome card based game based on creating/maintaining (often ridiculous) secret conspiracies and networks.

The artwork on the cards, the diversity of cards with all the expansions, the hiliarious groups are all awesome.  Has a lot of replay value, and is always a fun time.   

Very dependent on playing with people who dig the theme, probably not worth playing otherwise.

Oh the delightful hours spent on my dorm room floor, Paul as the Gnomes, Steve as the Illuminati, me as the Network... the only real flaw here is the essential problem with games that allow players to gang up on one another.  They drag on and spending everything to stop one player from winning just lets the next guy take it.

RATING: 3
It sounded cool... until I opened it. There wasn't enough humour on the cards.
After one play - I attacked another player, took a bunch of his cards. For the rest of the game I had much more money than anyone else, so no one could attack me, he was so crippled by my attack he never recovered, and was way behind.
Maybe if we played it again, and people would gang up on the ones who are ahead, but then that's not really fun either.
Just thought it was a bad mechanic, that one attack made a game for me, and broke it for somebody else.

This game depends a lot on with who you play it. You need communicative people and its better when you are friends. This game includes treason and betrayal and sometimes, if taken too serious, you might argue a bit.

In my playgroup this is just perfect as we can seperate gaming time and "normal" life and we love the game a lot. Most of the time you will have a laugh with this satirical game. It is great fun, no matter if you can actually win or not. Just have a beer or two and form a new world order!

The game is easy to learn and best with 5 players (4-6) and takes 2-4 hours depending on the number of players and their skills (the higher both is, the longer it could take).

Plays: 10+

Very complex game play made confusing by the somewhat ambiguous way the rules are written and the fact that they are poorly organized over many pages. Related rules can sometimes be several pages apart and there may not always be a clear connection between the two (ie: rule x might say "changes y" but rule y doesn't say "changed by x"). We play a few times a year and find that we need to re-read most of the rules to remember the specific sequence of play and who can do what out of turn. The ambiguity of several parts of this game also mean that we have about 3 different ways that we play and have never felt any of these is "correct".

We know you read this!
This is a fantastic card game of conspiracy and powerbase building. It plays very smoothly compared to the collectible version but it is not for the faint hearted. It is much more complicated then the average card game but a lot more satisfying and repeated playing will make everything second nature. Each player picks an Illuminati group to start with. Some of these are more powerful then others but it is not always good to be the stronger as everyone will be gunning for you. You draw and lay out groups, Professional Sports, Republicans, Yuppies etc., to build your powerbase and try to take over or destroy groups of the other players. When groups try to take over or destroy other groups there are quite a few factors involved. There are different characteristics to each group such as Liberal, Conservative, Weird, Criminal etc., and these affect bonuses when attacking. How close you have placed the groups to the Illuminati, how much you want to spend and whether or not other groups will get involved all add to the bonuses. Add to this special cards that can change things and different bonuses for attacking to control or to destroy and you end up with a fairly complicated game. This is still very much worth the effort. The card art is very good and adds greatly to the game. My personal favorite is the group 'Cattle Mutilators.'

I'm going to reserve my rating until I've played this again with more people, because 3-player games just suck. In the game we played, it just seemed that the other two players screwed with me, and left each other pretty much alone.  That left me in the end game of being barely above my starting position, while the other two guys raced for the win.  I like the game, but I really need to play it w/more than 3 to get a better feel for it.

Ok, played it 4 player now.  It's a pretty cool game, with lots of opportunities to screw your neighbor, and lot's of different ways to win.  In our game, at least three of the players were at one time or another within one turn of winning, only to be stopped at the last minute, which made for a very tense, and ultimately very fulfilling win for ME!  However, for some reason, the game just seemed way to s-s-l-l-o-o-o-w.  It dragged on far longer than it seemed it should have.  It's a great game, but I have to be in the right mood to play it, otherwise it's a real bore.

Good old Illuminate.  My local gamestore suggested it to me when I first started to get into gaming. I only owned 10 or so games and I thought what the heck.  Well I was pleasantly suprised.  It was good and I enjoy it, plus so far every one I have played it with has enjoyed it.  I can imagine that after playing it a while the game will get longer as people will be better at stopping that one person slipping through for the win.  I have to be in the right mood for the game, but when I am it is always fun.  In case anyone cared, this was the game shops only good suggestion to me ever.

The downside would be that this is a lengthy game to play, and has a semi step learning curve. However I find it to be a classic and one that regularly makes its way into my gaming nights.

I tried this game for the first time at Connecticon 2006. It was tons of fun, and I haven't lost my affection for it yet. Yes, the endgame sees the dogpile effect frequently, but I enjoy it all the same.

Had listed as wanted, but changed my mind. I think I was originally interested based upon number of players, but reading the comments suggests that it will be a very long game. I don't think that will go over very well with the people I like to play with.

This is such a creative game with a tremendous amount of theme that will make every very entertaining. Strip out the theme though, and theit is just a long card-playing game that will get old fast. While the game is nothing like Junta, it reminds me of it because the theme is so good AND funny, yet the game itself is only average.

Fun game.  While not a brilliant masterpiece from a rules standpoint, the game does offer some things that others do not, like a reason for non discordians to utter "fnord".  This makes it an acceptable game for parties.

Fair.  I used to love this game, back when I was obsessed with secret societies, suppressed history, and Robert Anton Wilson.  Now every time I contemplate pulling it out I just think "eh."  Too complex and exception-riddled to teach to non-gamers, and there are better gamers' games out there.

Update 2008-03-12: Finally sold on eBay.  Felt like a rite of passage or the end of an era.  I'd owned it since 1989.  Sigh.  Hopefully it went to a good home.

One of the best card game designs ever. This edition combines the original with the first two expansions and changes a few cards. There have been at least 2 editions of "Deluxe" (the black and white one from the late 1980s and the color one from the 1990s), each having a couple of variants that correspond to the various printings. If you want to use the later expansions Y2k and Bavarian Fire Drill you will need the color edition.

Once was a favorite.  The powers are unbalanced, so the players need to be experienced about the imbalance to even it out in the game play.  With experienced players it can really be a great experience, I'm just not sure when that will happen for me again.

Let it be said that in general I dislike ALL Steve Jackson and similar games, they are all theme and no meaningful game play.

This is a fun, conspiratorial game with different goals for different Illuminati. Keeping track of variable winning conditions, while building your own web of power is a trick. Cutting deals, and backstabbing are encouraged. Love the cards, the conspiracies, the power structures, and the game play. One of my favorite Multi-player card games...and yes...even better in this capacity than MTG.

I own the non-color deluxe edition.  I understand all the issues with the game (believe you me, I am ALWAYS the one ganged-up on by my so-called friends) but I still love this game.  Those rare occasions when I survive the group attack to pull out the win, are oh so satisfying.  Or better yet when I manage to convince one friend to make that trade where we pull off a joint-victory leaving the other confederates in the dust.  Classic.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Classic game of conspiracies.  The groups in this game are hilarious, and there are some really interesting variants out there.  Don't play if you're adverse to lots of simple addition and subtraction.  The game plays a little long, but it's fun to build your power structure.

This is one of those games in which you and your opponents screw each other hard and often.  You may both aid and hinder another player in the same instant.  If you or your friends/family can't take that kind of cutthroat action, then this is not the game for you.  If you are like me, and relish in seeing your buddies lip quiver after he has put everything into a roll, only to have you negate it at the last minute, then this is definitely a game to have on your radar!

The rules are a little complex, but within one time playing a somewhat experienced gamer should be able to pick it up.  Gameplay and strategies are varied, there is a lot of humor in the cards themselves, and who doesn't want to be in the shadows running the world?

Have only played this a couple of times, and inexperience of the rules meant we played poorly, generally ignoring rules such as neutralization and destruction of groups completely.

From my limited knowledge of gameplay, it's not a quick game though.

An updated (and, more importantly, in print) version of Illuminati that incorporates the first two expansions from the old version and supports a couple of expansions of it's own.  On the plus side it has standard playing card size cards that you can shuffle easily and money that doesn't go flying everywhere when someone sneezes.  On the flip side, it's not nearly as portable, but that's a minor preference issue at best.  Money tip: the Megabucks fit perfectly into a large 7-day pill container.  My house rule sets the Network victory condition at 20 transferable power.

I have fond memories of playing this in the club car of a train on a long train trip. Unfortunately not long after we started we were asked to stop playing because they were starting to server alcohol, and you weren't allowed to play cards while alcohol was being served. Considering how long it takes to play, it was probably for the best that we were forced to stop. However my tastes in games has changed and I'm not not well-disposed towards long games that can turn on the roll of a dice. Yes, the cards are clever, but there's too much calculation and too many people out to get you for me to really get into this game. I can't see any great strategies other than "don't be attacked", and where's the fun in that?

While the game has some very cool ideas - particularly the puppet organizations and 'org chart graph' gameplay, the interactions are all so crunchy.  It felt like for to even consider an attack on another player's organization I was going through the same 8 point calculation for each side.  Neat but would make a much better web game than table game.

Only played once so far, but it seems to be a very solid game with interesting mechanics. I have actually described it as advanced Munchkin, which I definitely do not use to besmirch either game.

My only complaint about it is the length of the game. It runs a little long, especially considering the fact that the level of player activity is so low. (When it is not your turn, you only have legal moves when the current player is trying to acquire/neutralize/destroy a group.) The game seems to drag a little bit, but I guess that's why "cheating" is "encouraged". (Both in quotes because there are rules on cheating.)

At one point (long ago), this was my favourite game and I would have rated it a 10. But that was due more to the players than the game itself.

Illuminati is really a framework to allow players to scheme, deal, negotiate, and double-cross each other. However, this framework is pretty loose and while that can be an advantage, it requires that the players understand this and approach the game with the right mindset. If they don't, it'll fall flat.

Cosmic Encounter (the game that inspired Illuminati) works better at guiding players into the right mindset due to its more formal structure.

Man, did I want to like this game.. But the amount of counting and adding and mental math necessary is just un-fun. There's so much to keep track of, that it just sucks all the fun out of the game. If you love adding double digit numbers repeatedly, this game is for you.

This is the game that really set me on my board game geek path many years ago.  The game is extremely funny and often times fun, but takes far too long to play for what it delivers, relies extremely too heavily on luck, and suffers from the "attack the leader" syndrome throughout the game.

However, it looks like it was unable to capture the wonderment of my first play. Present criticisms abound, with play times dragged out due to stalemated positions.

Update (08/27/11): first play in a long time, with an enthusiastic teacher to move the game along. 3 players is not the way to go. The silly wackiness of Steve Jackson is present, with unlikely, bizarre groups associations: "Fiendish Flouridators" controlling "Microstuff", with funding from the "Tele Psychics". It's funny for the first hour, like its descendant Munchkin, but then the banal stupidity of the game mechanics become apparent, where the various groups engage in a multi-directional pissing contest. We called it at three hours. It was fun when I was sixteen; it is not even remotely challenging or engaging nearly thirty years later. It's a '5'.

Wicked old-skool fun—

SEVEN YEARS LATER

—when played with the right people with the right mindset in the right timeframe (read: [i]weirdos, party-time, briefly[/i]).  Much like SG's other, uh, [i]infamous[/i] design, this is more about the wacky card combinations and emergent narrative than the mechanical stuff.  And like that other one it's just plain godawful with the wrong people even as it tries to stretch 30 minutes of fun across three grueling hours, an exercise much like trying to fit a dead congressman into a pair of pantyhose—the dildo goes in easily enough, but who was the moron who brought the petite taupe?  The instructions clearly said [i]sparkly black[/i].

Protip: [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/18018/shorter-illuminatirtf]Imminentizing the Eschaton[/url] works pretty well for a shorter, but still satisfying, game.

A COUPLE WEEKS LATER

Also, this thing has ludicrously... [i]opaque[/i] rules for what it's trying to achieve.  I almost wrote [i]complex[/i], but they're not really all that complicated—just needlessly detailed, with massive numbers of teeny modifiers, counterintuitive rules exceptions, and pointless minutiae.  While this is par for the course for pretty much all Steve Jackson games, I'm left wondering if the purpose here was intentionally meta, or just a happy accident.  I mean, it makes perfect sense that a game about world-dominating conspiracy would be utterly labyrinthine.  Still, it can be a pain in the ass in actual practice.

When in doubt, ditch the accounting and just make yarn maps.

Includes:

[thing=576]Y2K[/thing]
[thing=22049]Bavarian Fire Drill[/thing]

Up-rezzed with MOAR MONEYS:  Two sets glued together to make them double-sided and thicker to aid the piling of fat stacks and the tossing into the bank-hole during interference storms.

[size=7]PS.  The cards from the various sets are three different sizes, and since I'm allergic to sleeves ([i]ptui![/i]) that means that the deck has the appearance of a deckle-edged book.  But this is obviously all part of The Plan.*[/size]

[size=5]*If we take the three card sizes and assign them numerical values based on when they were released (1, 2, 3), then any given shuffle produces a finite string of numbers

13122212322132333123112212...

which, when separated into double digits

13 12 22 12 32 21 32 33 31 23 11 22 12...

can be compared against the alphabet to spell out revealing— yet troubling—messages.  (Of course, I'm using the [i]actual[/i] alphabet, with all 37 letters (not counting diacriticals); otherwise it's just gibberish.)[/size]

It was fun to play and the cards and situations were very amusing, but I can see that getting old quick. Also a little long: our game finished after 3 1/2 hours, and that's only because most of the players didn't know the game well enough to *really* prevent people from winning. (Josh says he's played games that have gone on for 6 hours... no thx)

RATING: 6
A game to play when I'm willing to talk more than play. It's nearly impossible (and not recommended) to play the game without forging alliances (and breaking then). This way, you spend most of the gameplay talking and negociating. Another thing that makes this game so fun is the fact that it's one of the few games that explicit say the "rules are made to be broken", stimulating that players cheat. This makes the gameplay chaotic in someways, and funnier, much funnier in lots of ways.It's gameplay is very "Steve Jackson's like", melding cards and dices, being the basic concept rather simple to understand (altough you'll probably need a chart to keep track of all the modificators that influenciate the game, until you get really used to them)

Berg doing a euro. Sadly despite the best of intentions and a few good ideas, this game doesn't work. It should have focused on diplomacy and deal making and left the euro mechanics out of it. I love chrome laden designs like GBoH, Pax Romana and others, but this game is lacking in many departments.

A back-stabbing/negotiation game with secret organizations such as the Servants of Cthulhu, the Bermuda Triangle and the UFO:s trying to control the world by taking control of governments, activist groups and such, and peppered with dark humor? You can't top that easily! This game get's the players around the table to glare deadly at each other more than any other game I own. A bit too long for what it is and has some fiddly part, like all the money counting (a serious killer in our group with couple of our regular players), but I still enjoy it.

Sadly, it seems my friends don't really like this one anymore. Some have even suggested I get rid of it. Well, while I have to admit that the game is needlessly long, random and spiteful, it is also fun and humorous. And I really like the theme. So it's a keeper for me!

Another excellent introductory game for non-gamers, and a fun play for those of us already in the club.  Take over the world, one group at a time.

Quickly, we found out how great this game was & how hilarious conspiracy theory could be.

Having the United Postal Service control the Mafia seems to make sense.

Love this game, but sometimes game length really detracts from the experience.  I wish I could get this on the table more often.

Update (8-29-06):  Moving this up to a 9.  A significant contributing factor to the extended game length I've experienced is because I'd misread the rules and thought each player could only perform a single attack per turn.  DOH.  After playing the right way at Gencon this year, it makes a world of difference.

Colorful and humor-filled card game. Plays straightfowardly, but there are a lot of decisions (control to help your faction, neutralize, destroy, protect with money, save money to mess up other players) and variables (each card has abilities and traits, multiply that by the number of players). 

Good balance, but it's [b]too mathy[/b]. Progress is fluid until someone is winning; then the game turns to "what can we do to prolong the game?" Unless you're really interested in winning just to win, you'll [b]most likely lose heart and give up from the win stagnancy[/b].

Classic game that come out almost every time any of my gaming groups get together. I have one group that plays "nice" and doesn't really sabotage anyone else.

We always attack each other, and usually one person ends up sitting back and winning while the rest of us destroy each other.

I ended my first game as the Discordians by trading the Mafia to the Bavarians for the Hackers and sharing the victory. Later I realized that being the only person with lots of cash at that point I probably could have just grabbed any card I wanted, but at the time I was fairly pleased simply because I had been anticipating the move for a couple of turns. For some time before that, though, the game had felt more like an aimless plod. You may spend about as much time collecting your income as taking your turn, and it's perfectly possible that none of your actions in that turn affects the game state whatsoever. Of course, everyone should properly be fully alert during everyone else's turn, in order to assess and contest attacks, suggest bribes and trades, and keep track of just how much you can contribute to preventing player A from winning without letting player B do it instead. With the amount of modifiers that must be counted up for each attack, the tit-for-tat counter-spending of resources, and the built-in kingmaker routine, Illuminati feels a little like a Munchkin prototype with more potential for trickery but also more maintenance work. I think it may ultimately be the more worthwhile of the two, although that may not be saying much. Using poker chips instead of the one-sided cardboard money should speed things up in the long run, but on the other hand the rules effectively specify hidden money and this may be for the best.

I adore this game. I know it's clunky, I know some of the groups are unbalanced, and I certainly know I can never get anyone to commit to the time it takes to play it out. I also know that I never, ever win. But when the Society of Assassins takes control of the Dolphins through the Mafia and uses them to destroy the Recyclers, it all becomes worth it. [Editor's note: Best played with (1) friends who don't care if you get spiteful, and/or (2) spouses - they're stuck with you, even if you go out of your way to demolish their power structure.]

A quite innovative little game of backstabbing. In my eyes definitely a must have (this one or one of its cousins - Hackers or Illuminati NWO or Crime Lords).  Beware that the game can easily take 3 hours and with many players. Also the money aspect makes it more fiddly then Hackers.

RATING: 7
One of my life-long favorite games. The basic idea is that each player assumes leadership of one of the secret societies which truly control the world (an "Illuminati").  They then seek to spread their influence and take over the world by taking over other groups that are played onto the table.  For instance, the Bermuda Triangle could easily work through its puppet, the Mafia, to gain control of the Semiconscious Liberation Army.  It is humorous and fun, but also has great player interaction, lots of social elements, and still involves a lot of strategy and tactics.  I've played it with people from many different backgrounds and most people can get into it pretty well.

Problematic, both from a gameplay and a component viewpoint. Kill-the-leader IS the game - the trick is making yourself look like you're not in a position to win.

Illuminati’s a great game with a nice array of sociopolitical commentary and a fair degree of obscure 1980’s cabals.  The play is a great way to alienate your friends and the Cold War style left me feeling disturbed.  Somehow I gave it a seven.  Apparently I liked it?

Absolutely amazing, this game is insanely cool IF played to win. The problem is that people can easily say "fk dis" and give the victory to anyone. Overall one of my best experience ever in any game, the political dynamic is so intense. 

It's such a unique game and it can offer an insane simulation of world domination but it's DEFINITELY not for everyone.

In this classic Steve Jackson game of world domination, each player is a secret society attempting to spread its tendrils into special interest groups throughout the world. This latest edition comes with additional cards and reworked graphics to bring the venerable game up to date. A supplement with two additional Y2K-themed decks is also available.

RATING: 5
A classic Steve Jackson game.  It's a fun multiplayer CCG-like game (before there was a category as CCG) with a very amusing and highly entertaining theme.  But, it's too long for my tastes in regards to the type of game it is and I  would like it/play it more should game length or goals were somehow shortened.  I also firmly believe there should be some small tweak to balance out the advantage of start player (1st plyr usually has the most opportunities to meet game-winning goals earlier than anyone else).

Although the rules are fairly straightforward this has been shot down as too complex a couple times when we tried to introduce it to folks (granted they were boardgaming neophytes). Would like to get this in heavier rotation in our playlist. Has the typical SJ card games humor factor, but I'm tempted to say this has a stronger mechanic under the humor than the Munchkin family - it may just be my lack of experience w/Illuminati talking though since I've played it about 1/50th of the frequency I've played Munchkin.

RATING: N/A
Players play cards, like they were tiles, arranging them and connecting them in trees and branches.  Each card represents a group like "republicans" "police department" or "babysitter's union".  Each card has attack and defense values, and a local economy, and sometimes special abilities.  Utilizing these, you have a host of attack options to take over neutral groups, destroy groups belonging to the other player, and even attempt to steal groups belonging to other players, as well as cards connected to those groups. 

Its fun for 2 or 3, but the sheer length of the game means it almost never hits the table.

  This is actually the first game I ever bought for myself, so I still want to like the game and to a certain degree I do.  The theme is fun and there's a real appeal to playing a secret society bent on taking over the world, but I feel like the rules are a little too convoluted and unwieldy to really give this game a higher score.  Fun, but not impressive; this is still a guilty pleasure.

I love the conspiracy theme of this game! Making connection of the control hierarchy you create in the game (e.g. The Democrats controlling Girlie Magazines) with the real world is really hilarious. At the same time the game is quite deep, requiring careful moves and observation of the opponents.

The rules may sound complicated in the beginning, but are quite intuitive. Until you are able to memorize them, print and use the rule summary sheets available here in BGG.

Don't try to play this with dull persons in your group. They won't be able to get the fun. They will get bored and they will bore you as well.

Game mechanics do not really make this game fun.
Essentially, you are making "herring bone diagrams" or "flow charts" with cards.

Playing with adventurous players that have a sharp/quick sense of humor makes this game fun. The humor comes in from how they play the cards - otherwise the game feels... mechanical.

You need the right group of players to really enjoy this game.

RETIRED: This used to be my favorite card game, bar none- before I 'discovered' Euros. I've played every version of this game, including the CCG -- of which I collected every card made. This game can take a while to play, but the opportunites for hilarity and cutthroat strategy can make a fun play session, with the right people. Player interaction and humor usually make for a high rating, but unless you have the right mix of players who understand the jokes, a play session can be long and painful.

I was first introduced to the world of Illuminati with the CCG over ten years ago.  I thought the game was kind of fun, but CCGs tend to get old with me as I get tired of trying to keep up.

Glad to have played this, but don't plan on playing it again.  It is overly long, and quite prone to analysis paralysis in mid to late game, when the different permutations of cards on a the tableaus of a player and their opponent become very important in determining how far away players are from victory.  I don't have an objection in ganging up on the leader, but the game just slowed to a cumbersome plod towards the end.  

I can think of far better games that I would rather spend my time playing.

A game that aged well enough (it's from 1987) for what it is. Munchkin has learned quite a bit from it, though they are different beasts. It has some sort of tableau management and plenty of interaction. Regularly overstays its welcome. It's an OK game at best.

One of my favorite games.  The whole game is hillarious when you step back and look at everyone's power structures.  The basic mechanics are really quite simple once you get the hang of it.  Really, the best part of the game is all the political wheeling and dealing that goes on outside the 'scope' of the rules themselves.  Really fun.  The only downside is that when you get a lot of people playing, it can take a long time to play.  We played an 8 player game once, and it took forever :)

Negociating, backstabbing (Is there any Steve Jackson game that doesn't involve backstabbing?), deception, overtaking, destroying and attacking.  Every words your mother has told you to beware when you were little.  But now comes the time to make amend and don't heed those motherly advices.

Illuminaty can be frustrating if players try to lengthen the game for the sake of it.

I play Steve Jackson game with a simple rule to avoid that : Everyone play to their best possibility without trying to stall the game.  After one hour of play (with a timer), we have one last round and that's it, we count the point.  That's the only way we can get those games to the table, munchkin included.  

For illuminati, we pass along 2 starting faction and one choses which one to take.

One problem, winning. The game can drag on at the end, as people keep stopping a player from winning. Thus, who wins can be a bit arbitrary.

I like the art on the new cards almost as much as the art on the cards from the 80's, except I miss the 'Evil Geniuses for a Better Tomorrow' card art of the old set a lot.  Can sometimes take a while to play, and is unbalanced, but so what!

Ah Illuminati.  The theme is fun(though admittedly some cards have gotten somewhat dated).  The mechanics are fairly straight forward.  The real game with this game however is the metagame.  It's all about getting into the other players heads and influencing them.  Making certain(even if you are the biggest threat) no one perceives you as the biggest threat is the name of the game.  If you absolutely despise games that have a strong 'take down the leader' aspect, you should probably avoid this one.  While I do tend to dislike games that devolve into nothing but that(for example, Munchkin), I find Illuminati does a fairly good job at making the endgame an actual psychological game where skill at the game itself, and skill at manipulating the other players does lead to victory.  (An interesting variant would be to give everyone hidden goals... take goals and special powers similar but different from the originals, keep them separate and distribute both randomly... minimizes the 'take down the leader' aspect since goals are unknown... Definitely need some balance work as a quick house rule variant though)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
TL;DR  A badly dated negotiation based card game best played by Munchkin fans or not very discerning gamers out for their nostalgia fix.  Maybe.

I played the original pocket box edition eons ago and even purchased all the expansions, including the ill fated Brainwash (which I never got around to playing).  

This game was an old favourite.  I've played the Deluxe Edition (at Pandemonium GameCon back in maybe 2003?) and sadly, I don't think the game has aged well at all.  

Illuminati's play time is too long for whatever fun factor/gameplay contained wherein...  

Negotiations could be enjoyable, but combined with Kingmaking, player elimination, rules (optional) that allow cheating and an overly long game length, Illuminati is DOA in today's gaming environment.  The cards though, were a hoot at the time, but most of the pop culture references are now badly dated.  You had to be there...

What might be interesting would be a new Illuminati themed game that uses modern gaming mechanics.  How about that?

Anyway, Illuminati is a nostalgic game for me, fondly remembered, but likely never to be played again.

I love games where I am openly encouraged to cheat, lie, and stick it to the other players. More complex (and a helluva lot funnier) than Munchkin. Still - it takes too long for what it is, and no one but be gets the jokes. Traded away.

RATING: 8
A great, fun, directly confrontational game with a good theme.  It sort of shows its age - it can run pretty long, it has lots of ways that one player can wind up out of it with no way to get back in but no graceful way to exit, and the mechanics are sort of clunky.  Still, there's nothing else quite like it.

Reasonable game with nice assymetrical play (due to different factions).  Slightly luck based, though the diplomacy has always ruined the game for me (last game almost ended in a fist fight).

Great concept but after one play (with six players) there was just too much down time.

Nice cards and some fun mechanisms.

Borderline "activity" rather than game, with encouraged cheating, this is one of those titles that expects goofy humor and direct, unfair player conflict to subsidize its obvious lack of design craftsmanship. Not recommended.

I love this game, but it takes time, and several people to really play and enjoy. Not to mention the rules can be a little hard to grasp from time to time. I wish I could play it more often
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Most of the game is fun, but I'm usually let down by the endgame.

Can drag at times. I find the endgame is often anticlimactic, and often players get tired and just want to finish the game. Often it boils down to the leader getting ganged up on, players spend most of their money, the leader gets knocked down, then someone else sneaks in a win.
  
Still I think this is the best board game SJG has ever released.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Cool game, but a little outdated. Attacking needs to be streamlined considerably, but the rest of the game is actually kind of fun. Feels a lot like a precursor to games like Munchkin, but the Euro-ized mechanisms involving money management and set collection is pretty neat. I'd like to play an updated version of this game if they ever come out with one.

This game deserves more love. It also deserves a slightly better design. There's just slightly too much busywork in the income phase and this sometimes slows the game down to a stoned crawl. I might have a stab at simplifying the currency system sometime. I don't see why all the cards don't display the system of oppositions and affinities too, would make things much easier.

I liked the premise of this game, and it was fun to play.  However, late in the game the group I was playing with spent far too much time counting how much money each other player had.  I almost wished that we had played where you couldn't see how much money each other had, at least then you didn't have that urge to count all of the money on the board before playing...

A great game of money, power, intrigue, backstabbing, and humor. This game offers a world of opportunity to seize power for your self and stab all you friend in the back while reading all the humorous cards in the game. With 8 different Illuminati, each with their own unique powers, there are lots of different tactics to be employed. If you haven't played this game, Shame on you.

RATING: 7
The group LOVES this game. The slight randomness and length of the game keeps it from hitting the table too often, though. It always seems to get suggested as a possibility. But doesn't hit the table when compared to a few others that also get suggested.

RATING: 7.9
I do like this game, but it has its flaws. The theme is hilarious and entertaining, but when you've been beat down for the third time because you were close to winning it gets pretty stale. This will always be on my shelf, but can be assured it won't commonly be on my table.

This was still my first venture back into gaming, after a long gap of being too cool for geek school. I will always treasure my copy because of this. First game to get obsessed with since axis and allies in my early teens. Played this a bunch of times in my early 20s, before I tracked plays on bgg.

This is one of the few steve jackson games I'd consider playing again.  Although generally fun and true to theme the game has a tendency to overstay it's welcome and turn sour.

RATING: 6
Funny satirical party game where players build networks of power groups (these include parties, mafias and other mock unions), attack the other players' and negotiate or backstab as much as possible. Of course it's especially recommended for a number of players from four to six. The gameplay is vaguely reminiscent of wargames and Bob Abbott's Construction, with players throwing lots of dice to incorporate or neutralise groups on the one side and planning the structure of their power tree on the other side.

RATING: 5
This rating for the base game.
Good with the right players. I have the "modern" reprint which is compatible with INWO. The basic game is repetitive, and can take too long. However, with seeded cards from INWO there is enough variability to make it interesting.
The problem is keeping the base draw-deck balanced while varying the additional cards- there needs to be lots of preparation.
The cards themselves are great - fantastic art and some very good jokes. I used a scan of /The Weird Turn Pro/ as my desktop background for ages.

I&#039;m probably solidly in the minority, but I just don&#039;t see what the fuss is about for this one.  I&#039;ve only played one full game (that clocked in at nearly FOUR hours), and two others where I ended up having to leave about three hours in.  I got a whopping five turns in the latest game I suffered through, which is WAY to much downtime for me.  I prefer to actually play games when I go to play games, not watch endless chit-counting and head-scratching and listen to endless &quot;no don&#039;t pick on me I&#039;m no threat, really&quot; drivel.  This game is stale and no longer worth playing.  Just read the cards and chuckle at the supposed cleverness, then put them away and play something with more of a payoff.  Give me Age of Steam any day - it&#039;s a longish game too but it does it right.  Shame on all of you who confuse rules complexity and excessive length with quality.

RATING: 7
My first time playing this started out great! It looked very interesting and we were all kind of learning it. The guy who brought it hadn't played it in years. Then, I was foolish enough to find and call attention to the rule (OPTIONAL rule-that we hadn't decided to play with) that allows you to cheat unless you got caught.Fast forward 15 minutes in the game - someone (not me) tried to cheat-they got caught, wouldn't relent, arguments ensued. People got mad, accusations were made, people's genders were slammed, players left, the game got disolved & the whole thing ended before it really got going. Were you there that day at the Lucky Lab Brew Pub? Thats something I hope to never see again.Oh man, what a blowout that was...

Update- Played Apr 08 finally!  Ken taught it. 5 players. Tense tense tense.  A lot of jockeying back and forth when it became apparent that victory was possible for several of the groups. I was UFO and had 45 weirds that would allow me to win and also had 8 factions. People started tearing into me!  Awesome. They pulled me apart. Then Patty almost won, then Ken brought it in with the win stealing 3 of my factions off, although the others players and myself tried to prevent it with $$$.

It was a 3 1/2 hour game & only a small part of it dragged.  I think we had a good group-no one was afraid of being confrontational & you need this in the game to make it interesting.

This was a really fun game I'd like to play 1-2x a year probably. If could be shortened in time somehow (is that possible?)-that number would increase.

I wnated to like this game, I really did. I can appreciate the humour. Perhaps I have been jaded by playing against a guy who knows he game backwards and always wins easily.

The game has a very strong Steve Jacksonish feeling in it. A lot of luck and vague winning conditions. The pictures in deluxe edition are nice but still some reference to a single player would've needed. There are too many things to remember (for example: straight against weird or something and the unique winning conditions to each player).

The game has a nostalgic feeling to me but as a mechanic it's not very thrilling. Basic abstract war mainly. A good way to spend your time but not very rewarding experience.

This is a very fun game. It requires just a little more attention to rules than the average game (ie counting the support points and odds before a roll) but after a game, it should sink in and players will become a little more at ease focusing on the different objectives. Since every faction has a different goal, it keeps the game fresh and adds variety. There is a luck factor: drawing cards and rolling dices, but this game allows you to spend money to tilt the odds in your favor (and your opponants to make your failure more probable). The cards are also pretty funny, making reference to past and modern groups and events that did/may change the world. I recommend playing with people who are strategic enough to keep aiming for their goals but also can work to prevent others from attaining theirs. All in all, a great idea of a game and nicely elaborated.

Like most SJG card games this is humorous and highly satirical. Girl Guides controlled by the Communists? Mad! Then you play and realise it is just another SJG card game that gives you too little to do. Spent the last hour staring longingly at the next table playing El Grande. At least the end game was close - everyone could have won with their last dice roll. Read the cards, chuckle and then get back to something decent.

Nice game, funny and interresting. there are times I think the rules are too complexe ... but I like it like that. The important think, about this game, is to monitor your oponent&#039;s progress; but it&#039;s not easy if you&#039;re playing with more than 4 other players.

This is one of the very few cardgames that you feel like you actually have full control over the strategy of the gameplay, you are not at the mercy of what you draw from the deck.

A very good game, and one which really shines when 4 or more players play (and bicker and bribe and cajole)

Mine is the 1987 edition, the first appearance of regulation-sized Illuminati cards! The collectable game wasn't too far away after this! I still had the old little sets, but I needed this for the bigger cards. The box is a bit beaten, but all of the cards are still there in excellent condition with the original plastic tray, and I still have the instructions and the MegBuck Chits.

A popular favorite among our group and my signed copy from Steve Jackson himself is the envy of my fellow players. While there are some niggling balance issues and the game never seems to be as cut-throat as it should be, it's always fun to play.

This just goes on and on, doesn't it... endless back and forth, no fun if you're not into conspiracy theories. (This game is like reading the Bible if you're an atheist: really a waste of time on a theme (conspiracy nuttiness) that outwears it's welcome and fun. Yeah, those conspiracies are really silly. But talking about them all the time/playing a game about them is just too much.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Basic Illuminati is better. With the right group this is an okay game. With players who find no humour in the cards it's a complete dud! It needs a second playing soon after the first so the arithmetic becomes second nature and players can concentrate on the fun in the game. It's all about player interaction and getting into the feel of the game. I find the basic game better than the deluxe version because there are fewer cards. That means sooner or later cards necessary to win will come up. The Deluxe edition can stretch the game out too long.

Illuminati was clever and innovative when it first came out, but by modern standards it has an overly clunky design, and is about an hour too long.

ARF, I just wanted it to end! This game has lots of die rolls and card related randomness yet it can actually go on for 5 hours! Maybe this could be remotely fun with the perfect group but I doubt it. It seems the game was designed just to make the cards fun and no effort was made to balance them. Such a long play time for such a random game ( + Player elimination!) is unacceptable!

I like this game quite a bit, though it goes on rather too long for what it is.  Also, I kind of wish I had held on to the original microgames that I bought way back when.  The new cards are definitely much nicer, but they are also much BIGGER, in a game where table space tends to be at a premium.

More fun than a 4, but lowered after many plays because with players of equal ability, no one is let to get ahead (as long as players keep watch on the overwhelming powerful illuminati, the Bavarians and the Gnomes), and the game either takes FOREVER (ie, someone wins when the others lose the enthusiasm for stopping them and continuing the game) or the game is decided by who finally draws the special card they need to thwart the combined efforts of the other players to stop them.  Lame waiting game.

My biggest complaint is that this game is (necessarily) long, and complicated (on the upside, certain playes will pick up right away, but not everyone will pick up so quickly). The complication, though, allows for what is probably a most ingenious strategy game that fits its theme perfectly. One of my favorites, but if only it was easier to introduce new players and faster to play.

My God, does this game have too many rules to digest.  I also hate it because it encourages cheating in the rulebook.  Really?  Yes, I know you don't have to use it, but the fact that the game even incorporates rules for it just goes to show what a dud this thing is for anyone who likes a nice, serious game.

EDIT: it's funny looking back on this rating now. I don't mind cheating within the rules in Cosmic Encounter via the Filch Flare, but I still hate it in this game and Munchkin.

Played this a LOT in my early gaming days.  I tend to enjoy SJ's humor, and really like the variety of  regular groups, as well as the goals and powers of the different Illuminati groups.  There is a lot of player interaction in this one and a lot of tension as the end game draws near.  Sometimes the game forces one player to be the spoiler which can limit the fun, but overall this isn't a huge problem.  I have seen several people complain that some of the illuminati are just too powerful (e.g., Bavaria).  This may be slightly true in 3-player games, but overall I don't see any imbalance issues and I have played this game MANY times.  Plays best with about 4-5 players.

I went through a phase when I resisted "beat the leader" games. 

Now, I think this is a hoot of a game. Enjoy backstabbing people and just cope with the fact that the winner will escape his way into victory. 

Also, this game keeps folks active during each other's turns, which is a plus.

Updated, higher-quality version of the original pocket-box Steve Jackson game.  Cleverly recycles art from the trading-card version (INWO).  Although it is a newer, costlier version, I like the cheaper, homlier, older version better.  It is still an ingenious game, and like much of Steve Jackson's early stuff, clever, playable, and replayable. Great take-that group game.

I liked Illuminati back when I first encountered it, but in retrospect I think the main appeal of the game is the ridiculousness of the control structures you can make. The engine isn't that bad either and I really like the divergent victory conditions and the provisions for binding agreements and shared victory.

I think Illuminati's main weakness is that it can get very tediously political, and you end up playing the sort of trade/bluff game I hate where you try to convince people that whatever deal you want to make isn't skewed absurdly in your favor (there are no other kinds of deals). The game ends up becoming very long as a result. One way to tone it down would be to prohibit or nerf interference from outside groups -- say, make them spend at a 2:1 rate. The fact of having to ask for permission to do anything really slows the game to a crawl.

We played this to death in college, snapped up all the expansions, designed our own cards, made Gnome jokes a-plenty. Fifteen years later, playing this game is like the Deathmarch of Bataan. Too long, lame humor, predictable "the last one who tries to win, wins" endings. Should we rejoice at having much finer games to enjoy now, or should we lament the passing of our youthful innocence? My friends, let us do both.

RATING: 3.5
This classic didn't do it for me. The money-earning phase takes way too long — longer than an actual turn. The layout is also too big for a normal game table. The bid-to-attack mechanic was tedious and makes the money-earning phase even longer. Just too tedious of a game. The artwork and humor is dated. Different strokes for different folks I guess.

Another favourite from the university years.  Back before PBEM we played by real mail and sent in moves each week (for which we have Paul to thank).  Weekly moves weren't so bad when you had this and several games of VGA Planets moving at the same speed.  Kids these days...

This game is the poster child for why I think Steve Jackson games are way too convoluted. I like diversity in strategy options and I enjoy complexity in games, but Steve Jackson games all have a ricochet effect of affects and outcomes built into game elements playing off of game elements playing off of game elements, etc. ad infinitum. While this certainly fits in well with the Illuminati theme (particularly if you've read the books), it makes the game inaccessible to most and borderline exhausting even to fans.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Steve Jackson's best game.  It's meaty, invites much diplomacy and double-dealing and allows a lot of strategy.  Just long and heavy so it doesn't get a lot of plays as it should.  The combinations of what groups attack to control other groups are entertaining because they exist in life, unlike the INWO expansion groups which are just stupid.

I've only played once, so my rating could go up, but this didn't seem like much fun.  Too much adding things up and not enough interesting decisions.  Every turn was pretty much "lets see, 10 for that, 4 for that, 3 for that, 2 for that, um, that's 19 power...um, I have 21 money to spend...ok let's see how much power you have on the group I'm attacking... 5, 4, 6, ....."  And the whole "omg, it's so funny when the girly magizines and the phone company take over the KKK!" thing really wasn't that funny.  Still with more negotiation and bluffing it might be better.  I'd have to play again (but I'm not really looking forward to it).

Played again with the idiotic "cheating is allowed" rule.  The closest I've ever been to flipping a gaming table over. Never again.

An early Steve Jackson title that holds a dear place in my heart.  I like its quirky sense of humor, constant back-stabbing, and getting the chance to watch your organization grow.  

The game is a bit math intensive, and really only works with at least 4 players, although 3 isn't too bad.  Definitely do not pick this up as a 2 player game... it is meant for group play.

Illuminati will be a great game for you if you enjoy humor, a little strategy, and a lot of harrasment of your fellow players.

If you take out the Negotiation (which basically says you can trade anything but cannot throw the game...a contraction in itself) it is not a bad little game. Some of the "advance rules" seem bogus though. I don't feel like all of the illuminati's are equal. Some feel much better than others. Also while the game suggests 4-6, I don't think I would ever want to play with more or less than 3-4. While I said it's not a bad little game, I think play is too long for what it is...and there are much better offerings out there. OH...the money in the game is a BEAST to organize.

Has the traditional problems you'll find in most Steve Jackson gangs (such as the '4th player wins syndrome'), but the mechanics mesh together a little more interesting than his other titles.

Light, silly fun, the specialty of [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgamepublisher/19]Steve Jackson Games[/url].  I've played it only once, but that's certainly enough to get the gist of the game.  I think that the design has some drawbacks, namely that the rules are just a bit complicated for something as light and chaotic as this.  Player aids to summarize the alignment oppositions and to give a brief rundown of bonuses would make this game a lot more playable for new players.  If you like take-that affairs, this is a pretty good example, but for most BGGers, this is going to be too chaotic to really be satisfying.

I like the idea of this game a lot.  The actually game while fun is quite flawed (Steve Jackson Game... go figure).  Pretty much the second guy that tries to win... wins... because everybody sells the farm to stop the first guy that tries to win.  There is great player interaction and I like the variable victory conditions of each illuminati.  Gnomes of Zurich are easily my favourite.  This is also the game that got me back into the hobby.

This used to be a staple of our gaming group back in college but there are some serious flaws with the game which makes it stick to my shelf nowadays. The biggest problem is the complete impossibility of predicting how long the game will take, due to the possibility of players ganging up on the leader and destroying most of his position. There's also a big kingmaker component to the game.

The game has a great thematic feel though, and that's basically the only reason why it occasionally still sees play when I meet with my old gaming crew.

Backstabby Fun + 5 hours == Once was enough.

Remind me to look up speed rules maybe, but even with that, I don't think this game has nearly enough intrigue for it's theme.

A little too fiddly for my tastes. I actually prefer I:NWO CCG better.

Sadly doesn't hold up well after all these years.  Keeping my all seeing eye tattoo though.  Introduced me to the Illuminatus! trilogy, so I have to give mad props for that...

Who knew paranoia could be such fun?  This humorous game stays true to its theme.  Easily gets unwieldy as the game progresses.  Keep an eye on your opponents.  They&#039;re plotting against you.

I appreciate the humor and some of the card mechanics are actually pretty well conceived.  Unfortunately, it is far too long, too chaotic and too much bookkeeping for my liking.  I'm happy to have tried it, but probably will never go for another game of it.

The base idea is good, but the game can really drag. I would like to see this in a faster updated version in which the problems in the gameplay have been fixed.

Fond memories of playing Illuminati for hours in college give this its rating.  I haven't played in years; if I do, expect the rating to suddenly drop.

A game of which I have very fond memories. The humor is good, the theme is great, but the gameplay leaves a lot to be desired. It can go back and forth endlessly, like all Steve Jackson games. It's by far the best of them, but that's not saying much. I think that if it played in 30 minutes it would be fine, but it's often a 2 hour affair.

Hilariously fun party game. This is a great game to play with 6-8 people. It can last for 3-6 hours. The strategy can get pretty intense even amongst all the laughing and frivolity.

Funny cards. Want to play this very much. It needs a weird sort of group, though. Not too casual, yet not too hardcore. Haven't found that group yet.

Edit: Played it. The game was won by cheating, as it should be.

My group takes this game as an excuse to be entirely ruthless and backstabbing.  The game can run long as it can turn into handicap the leader.

I've only played this once, and it was with only one other person.  I think with more people, it would be fun.  The cards definitely make it, though.

Nice to have, but time has revealed how much of a negotiation game this really is, which is OK but can overwhelm other parts of the game. Also, it doesn't seem as funny anymore. INWO, the CCG version, blew it by not releasing cards to match the headlines every year or so.

Sehr witziges Kartenspiel um Verschwörungstheorien, dessen (deutsche) Anleitung allerdings eine Katastrophe ist. Außerdem kann das Herumgeschiebe und Gerechne mit dem Geld bei großen Partien etwas anstrengend werden. Dennoch ein Spiel, das ich insgesamt mag und gerne öfter spielen würde.

Need your brain in the right place, and don't play if you're easily upset by getting picked on.  A masterful game.  A must try.  Gotta have the right players with you though.  Get some cagey sorts who refuse to go against anyone else, and the guy that looks like he might win definitely will.  Bring out the ruthless hats.

Hmmm, I bought this to take on a camping trip not realizing that to play properly you need a flat, level table and no wind whatsoever. So it didn't really work out. But the gameplay is innovative, unique even. I haven't played enough to know whether there is much strategy to this one.

Bizarre.

At one time this game would have been a 7.  You have to want to get into this game -- some friends and I did, hardcore.  We invented named for certain moves "The Alonzo Mourning", had a tournament bracket, and had quite a good time getting good at this game.  Eventually the differentness and fun wore off, and I'm not sure if we'll ever play it again.

+ There is no other game that can turn heads as easily as this one does; The actual piece/magnet placement is very strategic and lends itself to interesting back-and-forth between the players.
- You absolutely must have a rock-solid surface to play on, otherwise even the slightest bump will send your whole board into chaos.

Wow.  Now this is a cool game.  The only reason it's not a 10 is it's only for two (ok, so that's minor) and the rules that come with the game are the worst rules EVER.

Ah, the crazy magnets game.  Truth be told, the actual game is just okay.  The fact that the pieces are magnets is the genius here.  I'd rate it higher, but it loses points for the Unfortunate Spectator factor.  Polarity is one of those games that people cannot pass by without wanting to get a closer look, which means that most games, regardless of how hard-fought they are, end the same way: a bystander accidentally touches the table (gently, even) and ThwapThwapThwapThwap, all the magnets flip together.  And as frustrating as that can be, it's still kind of cool, in a way.... and it does make it, perhaps, the easiest game to put away when you're done :)

RATING: 6
Fiddly - but on purpose.  The coolness factor on the game is high and the dexterity level of the players makes a difference.  The cloth play mat is annoying as it is really needed for the game to work, but the fold creases negatively interfere with the game play.  An interesting game for a collector, but not likely to draw in large number of casual gamers.

Dexterity game with a little more to it than that.
Finding where the best place to start placing leaners requires a little practice, after that things get more complicated.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Firstly, ignore the ATROCIOUS rulebook.  Polarity is a simple game, and you'd best find a streamlined version of the rules on BGG.  Nevertheless, once the game is learned much fun can be had.  The magnets are less of a gimmick than I thought they'd be, and there's some genuine strategy here.  But be sure you have a steady hand, or you'll just become frustrated.  If you're in the mood for something that's a bit different and might attract a crowd, Polarity is your savior.    

Update: I've knocked down the rating two points.  As others have commented, quite a few games end with a race to see which player can create the most "leaners" without screwing up, and it really dampens the endgame.

After reading the rules, I couldn't work out how to build towers which are needed to win. After game 1 the answer became clear, you don't, your opponent does it for you. The game is about not making mistakes. Place your leaners and double leaners. Flatten them to make new foundations and wait for your opponent to slip up and give you a tower. Then close him down, and try to close out his opportunities and force more errors.

Did I enjoy it? Well I guess so but there is more a sense that its not actually you winning, its your opponent losing. Just an abstract exercise in dexterity.

RATING: 6
Fun dexterity/abstract game from a bunch of hippies in SF.  Attracts the eyes of passerbys because it looks so interesting and weird with the pieces defying gravity and balancing on edge.  Fun game too, a little wonky with the explanations of faults and whatnot, but fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
This game is like doing a Zen garden. It can be very relaxing. You do have to be extremely calm to be able to balance the magnets properly. My only problem with this game is that no-one else will play it with me.

RATING: N/A
A very interesting twist (one of the very few games that uses magnets), but I'm afraid it won't get much table time here.  Very nice components, though---canvas board, sturdy and hefty plastic bits with magnets inside them.  And the gameplay is VERY unique.

This looks like a cute little magnet game, but like most cute little magnet games it didn't feel much like a game.  I will try it a time or two more to see if there is anything here more than a gimmick... not sure there is, but it was mildly entertaining once so far.

Tried again and it failed.  Looks cool when it's working, but it's just too annoying to play. I'm done with it.

Several plays in and starting to get the hang of this. As a dexterity game it is extremely demanding and punishes the slightest hand tremor. Not quite sure whether the strategy (such as it is) will ever influence the outcome of a game anywhere near as much as the dexterity factor.

The magnetic mechanism this game is based around is interesting... but it just isn't that fun.  Yes, there are oohs and ahhs when all the bits fly together when the fields get strong enough, but it just isn't a fun game.  Sorry I spent my money on this.  All the pieces are sitting on the fridge and my wife's sewing wall holding up scraps of paper ;-)  Very expensive magnetic tacks!

RATING: 8
Utterly unique and draws in the interest of new players from many diverse groups--great with my family and friends.  Detecting those magnetic field interactions by feel is a compelling exercise for the senses: one begins to develop an extended perception for the invisible "lay of the land."

A good dexterity game will be A) not too difficult B) simple rules wise and C) will come to an inevitable ending in a short but not too short time frame.  Polarity is a neat and unique idea, but there are too many ways to lose (so fails B) and it is way too hard (fails A).

RATING: 7
I think I like the gimmick more than I like the actual game.  Rules issues bog down this one quite a bit as well.  It's amusing, but I'm willing to accept that if you take the time to absolutely learn the rules with another person, and you're both equal in your skill, then this game can be enjoyable.  The question is, am I willing or able to get to that point?

A Bizarre Game - Not sure if it is more Fun with Magnets than a game but it is a challenge and fun none the less.
1 Play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is all about placing your magnets. Specifically choosing where to place them (and having the skill required to do so). Balancing blocking your opponent, without risking setting off a reaction.

The game looks awesome during play, the disks just floating there. It feels scary when the disks start wobbling merely because you are approaching the table.

I enjoy the game in spite of two flaws.

The game involve a lot of back and forth that can make the game extend to an amount of time you don't necessarily want to invest in playing it. In other words, the game isn't consistently moving towards closure.

You can't win the game, you can only lose it. You require the opponent to make mistakes in order to win. Which is not my favourite dynamic for play.

Good dexterity exercise.  Just a blast figuring out the magnetic fields you have created as the thing moves along.

As a game: 5.5

I don't know if you can actually call this a game.  The rules are a joke.  They are ambiguous to the point of argument.  I also love it when your opponent screws up and it ends up being your fault.  I love how the designers chalk that up to a strategic play, rather than saying how lazy they are in not making a ruleset that takes everything into account and makes it fair.  You know, like a game.  This is more a novelty at this point.  I don't like to pay $30 to make my own house rules.

Still trying to sort out the gimmick. We haven't played a "serious" game yet.

Establishing multiple leaners is more like a solitare game of wits/patience. I became quite good at the multiple leaner gig, but I'm seeing very little advantage to using that skill in the game itself. 

Before I bought it, I was pretty sure of it.. but now that I have it, I'm not at all certain whether this will become a popular game in the house or not.

Dexterity games with magnets!  I enjoyed playing this quite a lot.  It requires a lot more fine control and concentration than most othe dexterity games.  Before we started, I thought I was going to have a hard time making "leaners" (I was having trouble in pre-game practice), but it turned out to be less difficult than I thought.  (We played in two teams of two players.)  Practice helps with this game, but two of us were new players and didn't have trouble picking it up.

As far as dexterity games go, this is one of the better ones.  And I say that not because the dexterity element is all that exciting, but because this is the "thinking man's dexterity game".  Think of it as a dexterity based area control game.  Truly, you are controlling areas of the board with your pieces' magnetic fields.  Playing pieces to control as much space as possible is an important strategy.  As with all dexterity games, the best laid plans will be prone to failure without a steady hand.

It certainly looks cool to see pieces leaning in the air. I do have a bias against manual dexterity games, so it's not too surprising that this doesn't appeal to me. But I do like some games, like Villa Paletti, and even Hamster Rolle. The difference, it appears (after only one play mind you), is that sometimes in those other games, my lack of dexterity causes me to bumble things, but there is strategy in what one is doing, and it's not JUST dexterity that wins/loses it. There are choices to be made. Now, with two people of equally excellent fine motor skills, there are admittedly strategic decisions in Polarity, but those without excellent dexterity, nearly every move is a bust. That's just not fun. I also have a problem with rules that take intent into account. In at least one case (as the rules were explained to me), the consequences for doing something are predicated on whether it was done accidentally verses intentionally. I [i]really[/i] don't like that. Ptooey!

Players alternate placing pieces onto a playing arena (cloth mat).  The pieces are strong magnets, and for a placement to be legal, it has to stand - perched on it's magnetic forces.  As the arena fills up, the interacting forces begin to make the pieces snap together, creating towers of pieces.  Rather strange, compelling game.  The rules seem rather loose, however it's all there.  Probably the most fun I've had packing up after a game :)

everyone who's played has liked the game. it's as my wife would say, an excuse to play with magnets, but what an excuse!  I'd like to try to find some different colored magnets, and allow more than 2 people to play.  Only gripe was with the turn not being over before the next person crosses the line. We've seen a couple of instances where by the next person rising from the chair to get better positioning, a piece has reacted. great game.

Based on 15 plays.
+ Innovative and unique
+ Dexterity game with a strategical element
+ Conflicts lead to towers of discs, which changes the magnetic fields in unexpected ways.
+ Placing leaners next to towers is always a challenge.
> We employ a house rule: if a disc causes a fault within three seconds from letting it go, we treat the fault as if the disc was in hand.
- The Ferti rulebook is completely useless -- name any possible flaw and it's there. Featuring mistakes in grammar, page layout, actual rules, and excluding half of the rules needed to play the game. Fortunately I found a better ruleset from the Internet (the same rules are in the Files section).
- With new players the game takes too long (frequent faults with discs that are still in hand)
- Frustration from faults that happen without visible cause.
- There is an apparent strategy: whoever knows how to place low leaners dominates the game

Since 2007, updated Dec 2011

Fantastic fun. Needs practise but as the cloth fills up, it's very hard to find a safe place to keep going. A very tricky game. *** Played again with a better comprehension of the game rules. I feel White is disadvantaged at the start as they get to make the first Fault, and if it is a Tower, then Black has a material edge in terms of space on the play area. We improved as we played, our second game was much closer, you hone your placement skills nicely.

If there are two things that I love in quirky board games, it is those games that employ the power of either lasers or magnets.  Polarity is of the latter, and a game I have been waiting 24 years to find.  When I was a young kid, I saw the game and pined for it.  Now it is mine.  Perhaps not the most sophisticated abstract, but one that certainly has a great charm.  It actually is quite fun to play, even if the rules aren't solid.  I'm going to try to tweak a few of them.

RATING: 7
The instructions are vague and horribly-written, and despite their verbosity leave many situations unexplained.  I'm not convinced that the rules work as intended, either.  If I understand them correctly, there is an easy move in which you can intentionally foul, creating a situation where the opponent can't pick up the stack without causing a reaction, thus returning everything to you.  If this is what is intended, I don't like it. *Update* I've been playing with some common-sense alterations to the rules: (1) You must make a good-faith move, no intentional reactions allowed, although intentionally forcing your own leaner to a prone position is allowed and encouraged. (2) If claiming a tower in response to your opponent's screw-up causes leaners to drop, that's fine, continue with your move.  If you cause a reaction, though, (disks coming together) that counts as a foul and the tower turns back over to your opponent.  With these rules, Polarity is great fun, actually makes sense, and has a reasonable amount of strategy to go with the dexterity.

Well you certainly can't say that it isn't different. This is an oddball dexterity game with some vague rules (but then Bausack is no better in this regard) that don't really cover all the possibilities. The unexpected interactions between the magnets generate plenty of amusement, although one clumsy move can give away a lot of points. Almost worth owning just for the weirdness factor, but the play isn't quite as interesting as you might expect. You tend to get four 'leaners' against each foundation piece, then it's just a question of waiting for a player to make a mistake.

This is a great game.  A friend that  I recently played the game with said that it reminds him of playing pool.  We set up the game table in the middle of the room and spent time walking back and forth around the table, checking out best places to play a disk.  Also like pool, there are certain types of skills that you need to develop before the game really starts to come into its own.  After you learn how to set up the leaners, you need to learn how to convert your leaners into foundation disks.  Once you master that part, them you need to learn how to convert disks in an offensive way to take over space and to force your opponent into taking disks into their stock.  Anyways the more we play, the better we get, the better the game.

I'm not good at most dexterity games, but this one is cool enough to where I don't care.  I like feeling out the magnetic fields when you place pieces and seeing the various weird happenings that come from resultant plays.  The game would be a lot better if it didn't break down after some experience into a single leaner line building game (at which point it's a race to the finish trying to avoid errors).  I guess I would prefer if snapping the pieces around was more central, and less taboo, to the core mechanics as they seem to be the most fun part anyway.  -Still a really neat idea.

Played it once, absolutely hated it. I'd guess that once you get the 'feel' of the magnetic forces down it'd become a lot more fun, but in the mean time there's just dreary 'that wasnt my fault' situations. As a beginner, game dragged on and on and felt tedious and very much out of my control. 

Normally don't mind this sort of thing (Buckaroo, jenga etc) but this just felt too slight as a game.

It's not everyday you run across a dexterity/strategy game, and this one takes the cake!  First off the game is played with magnets, which is automatically cool beans, secondly it has enough strategy to munch on, and third all decisions must be passed through the "can I actually manage to play that there" filter.  

Everyone I play this with loves it, and it sees the table lots, highly recommended.

Its a dexterity game; which by default means you'll need some measure of patience to play it. The plastic magnets felt cheap, but were pretty strong. The rules were horribly written, and it was pretty difficult to figure out which "fault" was which, especially when a whole series of magnets moved by themselves during the game.

Rules were horrible. Ok, more than horrible - pretty much the worst I've seen. Had to look them up here in order to play it. We couldn't even figure out how the game ended...

There's a bit of an experience and learning curve to this.  Beginners don't fare so well or have as much fun.  Invariably I turn my head away during their turn and *snapsnapsnapsnap* all the magnets are suddenly in one long column rolling off the table. 

I really like dexterity games and when very young I LOVED balancing magnets. I would create huge lines of balancing magnets and really wanted this game. Well it was reprinted - I bought it, and was extremely disappointed. 

Not much of a game and as far as fun balancing magnets - even the magnets aren't that great. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A cool idea for a game and placing those magnets is itself quite fun, but playing sometimes feels like if you had a toy instead of a game in front of you. The worst written ruleset I've ever encountered. English and German rules at least tell about different games and the paging of rulebook in 4 different languages could have been normal instead of idiotical (French 1st page, English 2nd page, German 1st page, Fr. 2nd, Dutch 2nd, pics, Ge. 2nd, En. 1st, more pics, Du. 1st). How stupid is this order? And English text is also really hard to follow because of obvious lingual problems. The coolness factor being ultrahigh, though, keeps this game in my (somewhat) good books.

I've reconsidered my stance on this.  What should be cool fun with magnets, falters for me because the game is so brittle.  While goofing around with the magnets is some fun, the actual play of the game is mostly frustrating.  

I have a copy from the original edition.  The box is very funny, showing intense shirtless men placing magnets.  And the box is much bigger than it needs to be.  Since this was a gift, and a hard game to find I am a bit sorry to put this on my trade list.  But the game doesn't work for me.

What a disappointment! First of all the original rules need some house-rules before this even works. The game itself is very defensive-like and both of players just need to focus not make any mistakes BECAUSE if you do, then you are in a bad situation. I was expecting more action and more speed. There will come a lot of situations where your move will take too much time... STILL very unique, fun at the beginning when you aren't familiar with those little magnets.

In this case, the poles of the magnetic field. The quality of play is determined by ones ability to perceive balance in the midst of extremes. Each game is unique and can never be reproduced.

I played Polarity about 8 times last night, each game completely different.  The idea is pure genius using magnets all over the place.  The game does require a bit of skill, not for everyone (please avoid if you suffer from Parkinson's Disease) .  Every game is unique, in that anything can happen.  Usually the 'end results' are absolutely hilarious, making way for a lot of laughter and screaming.  Go into this game with an open mind, a thirst for some abstract gaming, and you'll have a wonderful game session!

This game is pretty addictive and fun to play.  I like dexterity games but I tire of them pretty quickly.  The magnetism angle is very unique and fun to play with but wow is it sensitive to table jiggling and in my 1920's house a kid running through throught the room jiggled the floor enough to trigger faults.  Still, it is fun game that I would recommend to others.

Magnetism in a game?  Who would have thought that?

Polarity makes magnetism fun.  While a bit difficult to master, once one gets the feel for it, the gimmick of the first WOW moments gets somewhat less enthousiastic.

Nonetheless, a very good game to introduce the childs to the world of the magnetism.  I sure have kids that asks questions when they play with the bits....and more than when they play with the magnetic bits on the refrigerator in the kitchen.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
It's quite good fun, but there's an awful lot about this game that's just bling. The components are great and feel very nice in your hand - and hey, who wouldn't think a game about magnetism was cool? - but it does feel a bit gimmicky. Still a nice one to show off with though: "You don't think games are cool? Watch this!!" "Ohh, look! It's leaning in mid-air!"

However, I think the FFG game Rattlesnakes uses magnetism in a way that, if not as innovative, is certainly more approachable, understandable and, frankly, fun. Plus, kids can play it, too.

The problem with Polarity is that, once the novelty wears off, you won't be itching to play it again. Instead, this is one to pull out when you're having one of those: "You think games aren't cool?" discussions. Not so much a great game, then, as a poster child for gaming as a hobby. Your friends who aren't gamers will have more fun than you.

After many plays (I can't STOP playing it) since I recieved this game, I've upped my rating to a 10.  Why?  It's a combination of factors: elegant design, beautiful components, GREAT game play, infinite replayablity, and that "certain something" that makes you want to play it in public so that (a) other people can gawk over it and (b) to encourage other people to buy it.  I'm pretty stingy with 10's, but I'm HAPPY to award it in this case.  The ONLY downside is a TINY bit of ambiguity in the rules...

Weird magnetic dexterity game. Rating is low because of low replayability factor, but man it's an experience in itself. The sight of the hovering pieces combined with "feeling the force" is quite special in a boardgame.

RATING: 7.5
Game in a Nutshell: Balance magnets in a circular playing field but don't interfere with other pieces already in play or you'll give your opponent a chance to get some points.

Played as: 2 player

Pros: Really a Unique area-control game masked as a dexterity, brings a nice balance of finesse and non-linear strategy. Transportable in that it's nice to roll up the pieces in the mat and carry it around that way. Can hold some tense situations, so much so it often attracts observers. 

Con: Not as pick-up and play as is the usual moniker for dexterity games because of the 'feel' it takes to balance correctly and quickly. Horrible rule book, the pictures were its only saving grace. It can be tough to find an ideal playing surface, and in bad cases, you often find yourself playing around imperfections in the mat.

Other: I'm close to suggesting going without the box if you're considering buying this. The mat stores much better (less wrinkles) and smaller when simply rolled up and put in the supplied bag.

Best Use: A brainy dexterity game when you want to play against an opponent and physics at the same time.

RATING: 7
Using the powers of magnets, Polarity is a dexterity game in which the players are trying to get rid of their pieces by carefully balancing them on the hessian playing area in such a way that they stand up at an angle without falling over because pieces that fall ovr must be taken back into a player's hand. 

The trick here is that as the mat fills up the individual pieces begin to form a magnetic field and that can create various pockets in the mat as a whole that have implications for the placement and angles of pieces. Should a player place a piece that then attracts multiple other pieces to it, they are all taken by the player and that sets them back. 

It's very interesting stuff but there is a skill factor at play here that can make it hard for a newcomer to be competitive against an experienced player. 

In the end I consider Polarity to be an interesting exercise rather than an excellent game.

First impression: Dexterity game & magnets, great combination. Just playing around with the pieces is fun but trying to accomplish right things in-game can be stressful! (in a positive way) Works well with 4 players (played as teams) too as it is fun to just watch how other players are able to do their moves.

RATING: 7
The game is way cool-- though the dexterity part puts some people off, there's some strategic element to it that gives it a nice shine. I think the second player gets a bit of an advantage, but it's mitigated by some of the chaos that will end up occuring.

RATING: 6
A fun game that suffers from poor-quality magnets (the shell splits on about 5% of them).  Not a big deal, just requires a bit of glue.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fine dexterity game in which single magnets need to be suspended in the fields created by other magnets. If the action on the board is disturbed by any player while trying to enter a magnet into it, several outcomes are possible; in the worst of cases the player will end up forfeiting a stack of magnets to the opponent, who can put them anywhere on the board and have them contribute to his final score.

Once warm to the game and more or less efficient with the magnets, Polarity is easy and fun - the different rules for the faults are quite numerous, though, and they could have been explained much better in the early rulesets. So, the best way to learn the game is to get both the instructions and the strategy guide from the official website and read them in advance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A terrific abstract with genuine pick-up-and-play appeal. C'mon, there's very few among us that haven't sat and practiced leaning a Polarity disc against a five-high stack or creating that crucial leaner-on-leaner-on-leaner combination. Subdued genius.

Further Thoughts: A disappointing lack of longevity is responsible for a falling rating here. There's no good reason why we're not playing it a few years later - perhaps it will come to life again one day.

Further, Further Thoughts: It's back! A real class act of a game, and one which - on reflection - I've never been even vaguely unhappy to see hit the table.

RATING: 8
What an interesting game concept. After a little practice, adding a "leaner" got pretty easy, or so I thought. Once more disks are added to the playing area, the magnetic interactions make it more and more difficult to add a "leaner". The rule book seems very confusing at first read. But if you read the rules and play around with the disks at the same time, things become much more understandable. Right now, I will give it a solid 8 ... but this may go up after more play sessions and practice.

The game itself isn't much chop, with lots of technical, confusing rules about what's a fault and what's not. What's you've got them mastered (a cheat sheet helps the newbie), and you get to play with someone who gets it and can execute the same moves as yourself, the game generates interest just because it's so different. It's not so much about the winning - the game is more simply about the satisfaction of pulling off your moves.

This is a very different experience. Applied physics, dexterity and strategy rolled into one pretty zen package. Lovely.

Warning: English rules are horribly written. Feels like they where written in shorthand. Translated into french and back to english again through Babelfish. What's really strange though is that the german rules (in the same booklet) are so much more clearly and consistently written. It's not the same basic text that has been translated. It's more like the publishers asked two different people write the rules separately. Weird.

Anyway, this is a game I want to play again and again.

Who can play?  Family game for 2 players.

A clever game of magnetism and gravity.  Better as you get used to the relative power of the magnets and the different size towers.  I'm starting to think this game is really good and it's seems easy to get people to try it. It just works no matter who tries the game.  Occasionally, some non-game related disaster just totally screws up a game with all the magnets just snapping together 'cause somebody else bumped the table.  So be it.  I'll be playing this game forever.

A fun dexterity game with some tactical elements.  Many competitive games seem to come down to who makes the huge mistake that costs them a big tower (or rolls things into the center magnet).  This situation is not much different than something like Jenga or Villa Palleti though (where one person knocks the thing over).  All in all a very fun game where you can get some really fun interactions between magnets.  Teaches people a little too.. something that is always welcome in a game.

6 - As a game requiring precision dexterity and a VERY STURDY playing surface (my table is wobbly) it doesn't get much play and even when we do play the game it doesn't get many games before being reshelved as it is very draining, but it is fun until one player just gets completely dominated.

The canvas bag is about 2 inches shorter than the mat needs it to be, so the publisher decided it would just fold the canvas and then roll it up.   while this probably saved a bunch of money in production it leaves a crease that took forever to remove.

Unique, intriguing and sometimes amazing to behold. But be aware it's also a dexterity game, requiring not only a steady hand, but more importantly, an uncanny, almost paranormal sense of placement.

The strategy element is pretty minimal and the dexterity element fairly high.  Environmental factors (bumped table, slight gust, reaching over the table) play too critical a role to play this seriously.  A gimmick game with great magnets.

RATING: 6
As a magnet activity, it rates a 7 or 8, but the game play leaves me a little flat, a 4 or 5 - split the difference and there you go.  Interesting idea and executed well, but not something I'll play frequently.  The problem is that experience counts - it takes some practice to get those discs to lean just right.  If you have the chance, definitely try it.

Basically a dexterity game, like Jenga or Kerplunk, rather than a strategy game. Probably not deserving of a place on the abstract game lists. The magnets do not 'float' but rather stand on their edges propped up against the magnetic field of others. It took us most of our first game before we could avoid just crashing magnets into each other on most moves, I suspect it would take quite a few games before you had the necessary finesse to really start looking at strategies.

Fun concept, great bits and ok dexterity game. Our first game, neither of us had played previously and struggled wading through the miserable rulebook attempting to decipher it.

After getting a tenuous grasp on things it went smoother. Rating might go up with more plays.

Two Player value = Poor

Three Player Value = Poor. This is a two player game that requires teams to play with more. That really brings the game play down.


Polarity is an odd game. In fact, I am not sure much of a game actually exists. Even the designer stated that Polarity is less of a game and more like a sculpture. So it is a sculpture where you score points.

Polarity is a dexterity game where players try to balance magnets off the opposite poles of other magnets in an attempt to get their magnet to float in the air.

The dexterity part of the game is a bit rough. Learning the trick of balancing a single magnet off another single magnet in the clear is easy enough. The same goes for balancing a single magnet off two magnets that form a tower. However, once a tower contains three or more magnets it is near impossible.

Add to that a confined play area where you will need to judge the magnetic forces of several opposing magnets and the game gets very difficult.

It certainly is a novel concept for a game and it is good fun to see magnets floating in the air for the first time.

The few components the game has are all very nice. The magnets are built well and are strong. the canvas board and bag are a good touch.

The scoring is where the game falters. Learning the scoring rules is very simple. No complex rules here. Scoring points is not difficult either. Actually, scoring is too easy. With the difficulty is placing magnets, scoring points is extremely easy. 

Overall, the game is fun for first-timers and for the occasional play of a silly dexterity game.


Pros - 
- Silly fun 
- New and interesting design


Cons -
- Rough to learn proper magnet placing
- Which makes scoring too easy

Really clever dexterity/area control game.
Plays fast. Each game is unique and exciting. The fact that towers can be recaptured assures that the game isn't over before the last piece is placed.
Horribly written rules. Couldn't make any sense of them. (Luckily I had already studied BGG for several clarifications before the game arrived.)

UPDATE: The new edition has completely rewritten rules. Haven't seen them, but they can't possibly be worse than what I got.

Probably the only dexterity game that I like. It is a two player, which means I don't get a chance to play it much, but for a dexterity game it is very deep and complex. The only problem is that the rules can take a while to become intuitive, and it is best taught by a person.

I bought the 2006 reprint of this for my husband as a birthday present one year. It was just too abstract for me and the novelty of the magnets wore off after the first few game plays. Plus I was forever ironing the fabric game board to get the wrinkles out of it - with out much success. Interesting, that's the second game on this list where the inability of the board to sit flat on the table proved detrimental to the game play.

A very unique abstract game - dexterity game hybrid I ended up liking much more than I thought. There's just something about combining tactile skills with mind skills that appeals to me (way to rare in boardgames). The problem (I don't mind) is immense learning curve. The dexterity skill needed to even play this game takes some training. Then to be able to refine it and get so much better at it, that the game is also about spatial positioning and not just dexterity blunders also takes another skill level. Meaning - even for it being just a 2 player game, it's hard to find willing opponents. And on top of it, the rules in the box are nigh indecipherable (go on bgg and find better written ones). 

But it's just a unique zen-like feel to it. Combining the will of the mind with the imperfection and chaos of the material (well, magnetic) realm. Would rate it higher, if I'd be more inclined to play 2 player games than I am.

Played with teams of people, it goes from laid-back to edge-of-your seat quickly as each player tries to find a spot to place another magnet without distrupting the delicate balance of interacting magnetic fields.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The novelty of the magnetic fields is jaw dropping during the first play. Anyone observing a game will be anxious to try as soon as the game ends. However, this game may not have long-term appeal due to how difficult it is not to cause a fault after you've reached the midpoint of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
An original concept: dexterity and magnets are combined in an abstract package. Players used 26 magnetic discs to try and lay them out on the board using magnetic fields to hold them up. Brilliant!

The game is a little frustrating at first but once players get the hang of it, will be a blast to play. Top notch components. Everything is solidly produced.

This is a very entertaining game, in which the forces of magnetism play a substantial part.  It is very interesting to "feel" the forces as the game progresses and the slightest movements can influence the positioning of the magnets on the board.  Fun, if you have a steady hand.

A wonderful combination of abstract strategy and dexterity.  One of the coolest games that I own certainly.  Although, I have to say that if you find Operation a little stressful then this is going to give you a heart attack.  

I suck so horribly at this game. I have gotten better at this game, but I think that the real strengths of this game will only reveal themselves to me after I get good enough to manipulate the pieces the way I intend them to be manipulated.

I like dexterity games (probably because I'm not too bad at them) and this one is unique in my experience. Towards the middle and end of the game, the magnetic forces are so crazy that you need to be very careful that you don't cause a MAJOR disaster with a misplay. Very fun.

RATING: 5
Interesting dex game.  My rating is generous, given the strict BGG scale, in that it truly is for occasional play.  Players take turns placing magnets at an angle against the mag fields of their own pieces.  If the magnets snap together, that's good news for the opponent.  Game is over when all of one player's magnets are placed.  I don't understand the shapes of the magnetic fields, particularly when the surface gets crowded, so I'm playing blind at this point, but it's a fun, novel diversion.

Just bought it today, as it has been difficult to get my husband into gaming, and he picked it out.  It is a good game for light filler.

Seems good in concept, but nobody I have had try the game so far can achieve any of the positions pictured, I think just because my table is too unstable.

Odd little abstract-dexterity game of magnetic forces -- place discs such that they "lean" in mid-air on a magnetic cushion and try and avoid causing discs to move or snap together. I'm not sure that's that much of a game there but it's a cute novelty.

RATING: 6.5
[Temple Games tube (2005) edition] {Abstract; dexterity, spatial area-control} Polarity is an interesting 2p game.  Though it is a dexterity game, it needs strategy to win (similar to Villa Paletti). A player needs to know where to place pawns, in addition to skillful hands. Early game setting is important. One must place the initial pawns mindfully with the aim to occupy as much space as possible. This will leave more space to place pawns in late game.

Polarity is not designed for huge fun. Nonetheless, it has rich player interaction and confrontation and is fast-paced :) It's quite funny in watching how the opponent plays and is exciting when you are placing a pawn. It's sad that it just supports up to 2p. (maybe, there are expansions supporting more players)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.75
When I first got Polarity and played it, I was a bit disappointed; it was not what I was expecting.  I saw all the pictures on the 'Geek of carefully balanced magnets and thought that, however the scoring worked, the goal would be to be the player who could put on the best balancing act with your magnets.

Now that I've played a few times, I understand the game a bit better and it is growing on me as I shift my expectations.  This is a game of carefully balancing playing-it-safe while attempting to force your opponent into a dumb or dangerous move, sort of akin to games like Jenga.  

Bottom line, playing with the magnets is fun, and the rules are just an excuse to do so with some amount of structure and tension.  Since all I've done so far is introduce people to the game and summarily trounce them since I have a better familiarity with the rules and a little more practice with the magnets, I can't say whether it's something I'd play over and over again with an equally-skilled partner.  But it's a decent game, and like Fireball Island, is worth having simply for the fact that it attracts people to stand around and watch and be intrigued.

RATING: 8
I bought this game from a discounted aisle at a Canadian Toy R' Us about 14 years ago.  I've played it many times, and I do enjoy design and gameplay.  It is a dexterity game, where you basically gain points through your opponent's mistakes.  These mistakes come from either when your opponent;s action piece comes into contact with an existing piece; or when a leaner is flipped over. The pieces making up these errors are then taken by the opponent, and this leads to towers of stacked pieces, which denote points that are used for scoring at the end of the game.
It is quite interesting to see how new pieces added to the board have consequential influences with the existing pieces throughout the board.  Even more so when placing the stacked tower pieces when your opponent makes a mistake.  A new pieces can cause quite a ripple effect throughout the board.
It's not the most complex game, but for overall aesthetics and originality, I give it an 8.

Its unique, but ultimately does not scratch a gaming need.  Being said, it is not a waste of time... but it is quite of a parlor trick.  It is what it is, and that makes it a four.

Wow, I'm not really sure what to say about this game, except that it's remarkably different than any other game.  It can be terribly frustrating, but also extremely rewarding, as long as your patient with learning how to play.

Polarity is an OK game.  Not my genre of preference, but fun and a very original concept.  Don't store it near anything electrical/electronic.  I am probably biased because I am happier with a hammer in my hand then something as delicate and precise as a scalpel.  When you one pair of counters snap together, often they will take other with them.

[thing=380][/thing] is a good dextetiry game, and it looks amazing in the table, while playing - almost everyone passing by take at least a long look to what is going on with those pieces that look like floating in the air.

[thing=380][/thing] do requires a steadier hand than most other dexterity games, so it might not be for everyone, specially if you get frustrated easily by mistakes.

Surprisingly entertaining for a dexterity game. Makes a decent party experience too since the alternate turns are fun to watch, easy to understand and talk through without disrupting things.

This game would be greatly improved by better instructions; it's actually rather simple at its core and if turn procedures and scoring were clearly demonstrated it would be much easier to grab for a new group.  There's not much call for the instructions to be more difficult than 'pass the pigs' with illustrations of how to resolve (and score) various configurations. Instead, small, verbose text and small, unclear photos make it much more difficult than it needs to be.  Illustrations would allow 'motion arrows' and soforth to clarify what we're actually looking at.

I know that some have become enamored with Polarity, and a few that I've taught it to have enjoyed it to the point of wanting to play it over and over again. But for most that I've seen playing it, myself included, it's merely a pleasant distraction. I wouldn't turn down a game, but it isn't as gripping to keep playing. I love magnets, and whenever I'm in the mood to play with them - in a good game, mind you - I'll pull out Polarity.  See my review for more details...

Very unique dexterity strategy game using magneticism. Very eye-catching gameplay. The leaning of discs is very innovative.
Do not be fooled. It's not a pure action game. Skillful dexterity placement serves only the basic skill. Strategic decision making is however the key to achieve mastery.
Every game is a different game. No discret placements. It is the experience which Chess or Go cannot offer to you. Feel it.

Overall this is a great game when you finally get into it, but the 2 player limit really weighs down on its playability. I can see how this game could get addicting, but unfortunately I haven't become good enough at it yet so the strategies that are used become repetitive on a game by game basis.

Cool game.  I didn't realize that it was part dexterity game.  You have to move slowly and carefully to influence the piece you want to move.

This is a dexterity game that tries to dress itself up as an abstract.  Don't be fooled!

Well, it's certainly unique.  The placement of your bases is important, as is the skill of making other placements by pushing your leaning magnets out of place.  My only aggravations are that if anything happens on the board while it's your turn, despite your lack of interference, you lose your turn, and if you're playing against an experienced player, you're at a distinct advantage.  Otherwise, this is a cool, cool game.

(Trade Interest: medium) interesting concept, but the rules lack direction and clarity.  i found myself confused at almost every turn.  there are some illustrations on another sheet that help.  i guess it could be more fun with some practice.  but i could find no way to turn things around, once the discs were mostly flipped.  might as well stop playing.

After a couple of plays, I will initially rate this game as an 8.  There is a strategy in this game that is unique.   You must be aware of both where the discs are placed and the potential magnetic interactions they have not only locally but sometimes across the entire board.  There is a level of dexterity to the game, which may limit playing time.  However, I don't feel that the dexterity is everything.  Sure, you must be careful in your placement as to not disturb the other discs, but knowing where to place them and when to convert them, and how to create or set-up faults to your advantage is just as important if not more.

RATING: 7
Clever, quick playing game, but with some rules ambiguity. The novelty and cleverness of the magnets cannot be overstated -- it makes the game pop. That said, only a certain class of gamer will enjoy this, and only under certain circumstances. Gameplay is very location and opponent dependent. You need a nice large, level, sturdy table and players of roughly equal skill, or it's going to flop.

Finally, a dexterity game I enjoy playing.  I have nothing against flicking pieces around and balancing wooden shapes, but playing with magnets is much more fun.

I only played this once about 15 years ago, but I remember being struck by how cool the magnetic nature of the pieces were.  I must find it again.

This is a great game.  I'd say that those who say that it's just a dexterity game are missing the point.  Yeah, you need to have some skill at placement, but there is also a strong territorial grab element.  The rules are not really as bad as they say, and the stuff on the polarity website fixes any confusion I had.

Fun to play with the magnets, but as a game it doesn't really work.

After 1 Play: This is such a unique idea for a game that I think everyone should try it once.  That said, whether it's actually any good as a game will remain unknown to me until I can play it some more.

I finally found a copy of this fabulous dexterty game!! The board looks to become a work of art, before the magnetic fiels eventually collapse.

Requires Jedi Academy abilities, as you demonstrate your ability to place hovering magnetic discs into play.

Good fun. Make sure you play on a solid surface. Preferably on a carpeted floor, which will grip against the mat and keep it flat.

The rules feel a bit awkward at first, but this [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/80682/polarity-quick-reference-sheet-pdf]Quick Reference Sheet[/url] should help you out. What a treat, like a sweet.

05/05/06 - Rating 6 (dropped from 7): I got Polority, figured out the rules, played it a bunch one night, and never had the urge to pull it out again. What interested me was the tactical game which I believe really ended up being a one-liner. You want to place your pieces in areas that will disrupt your opponents placement options. Making this choice is never very difficult because it appears that, based on the way that the magnetic fields work combined with the rules for placing pieces, all options are either equal or too obvious. For me, this wasn't enough to maintain interest because there were no tough choices. Polarity supplements it's tactical game with its "dexterity" element (though I'm sure the designers would say it's the other way around), which I don't find to be very compelling once the novelty wears off (which is kind of fast). Maybe further plays of Polarity would reveal subtler undercurrents, but I'm honestly not interested enough to go looking for them.

11-30-05 - Polarity is a pretty crazy game that is half dexterity and half tactical maneuver. I really like its unusualness and am pretty much always up for a game of it.

Fun with magnets. It's a decent dexterity game, but I have no real desire to play again.

Usa tu destreza para mantener las fichas flotando con la fuerza del magnetismo. Cometer errores significa darle mÂ´sa fichas a tu contrincante.

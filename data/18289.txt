i think this is everything pirate's cove should have been in less time to boot.  minus the pirate theme, of course, but i think diving works great.  there's not a terrible amount of control in the game, but i think the mechanics are sound and the pacing is excellent.  not a ton of motivation to rush back to it, though.  i think i'd like it in a very small box, heh.

RATING: 6.5
A fun spirited game that really shows investment by the designer(s) to obtain and capture what gaming is all about.  Production quality is excellent.  Game play is light and the artwork stylized.  Despite its blind bidding and the havoc that the mechanic can cause in a game, this one somehow brings the whole package together nicely.  A nice offering for a rainy day or a pleasant evening home.

This game is forever linked with one of the tenderest of memories I have for someone I never met.  Find comfort in his peace and peace in your comfort.

Played without the thief option.  Players choose morning an afternoon actions.  Deep sea dives the most rewarding, but with additional monster hazards.  Monsters are bad news and likely scupper your chances of winning.

A bit too light, I think. In my one game I got a 2nd diver, then dive/sell/dive/equip and repeat (to get tridents, then hoses, then weights) and won in a landslide. Pretty automatic. Maybe there's a strategy here, but I'm not going to bother finding out.

I'm kind of surprised that this game isn't higher rated. Easygoing game that is easy to pick up.  I like the variable markets that depend on the number of people that chose the same action.

I'm normally a sucker for simultaneous action selection games. This game seems to fall flat for me though. Your choices (and the other players choices) are just too obvious. So it's not very hard to outguess your opponents. It just turns into a repetitive exercise in staying awake.

RATING: 6
An economic and psychology game about diving for treasure.  Often, the more players that choose an action, the more expensive it becomes to take that action (thus, it's in your best interest to figure out where other people want to go).  There is a lot of luck and randomness in this game, but it is cute and plays relatively quickly.  As far as the "exploring decks of cards" mechanic is concerned, I prefer the 2p game called Starship Catan.

Based on 1 play with 4 players:

Surprisingly enjoyable for something related to Pirate's Cove.

I like the diving theme. I'd like to see it applied to a more interesting game at some point.

Not a lot of interaction here. You mainly try to avoid each other. But you really have to pay attention to what other people are doing to try and figure out where they're likely to go next. I liked that one type of treasure actually sells for more when other people are there, though.

The pace and length of this game are what really saved it from being boring, I think. I had JUST enough time to build up my divers in the way I wanted and to get some fat loots before the game ended.

I could see the stealing getting really annoying. The rules for it are pretty stupid as well. None of us liked that you got to pick the card based on depth. It should be random.

Not a bad game, but I can't see my rating rising beyond a 6 and could even see it falling if I played it enough. Definitely engaging the first time around though!

I really enjoyed the 3 player game we had.  With my game group, the "Thief" rule couldn't be optional!  I couldn't see myself choosing this game frequently, but wouldn't turn down an invitation.  It scratches that "itch" where direct confrontation/screwage meet light & short.
After my 2nd game, I've elevated the rating to a 7.0, to me this is a borderline family game.  Light, simple ruleset combined with a buried treasure theme seems to have appeal to casual & somewhat serious gamers alike.

Faidutti at his best - interesting game (moreso than Diamant), with just enough chaos to keep people interested. Art is great, bits are not.

We have a LOT of fun with this one and everyone we have taught the game has enjoyed it. The basis of the game is the players are treasure divers in Key Largo. A hurricane is coming and so you only have about 9 days to earn as much money as you can. There are different activities you can do each day. One in the morning, one in the afternoon. The amounts earned when selling, and the amount cost when buying are often dependent on how many people choose the same activity. hire divers, equip divers, dive wrecks for treasure, sell treasure, visit the bar and buy drinks for clues from old captains, and take tourists dolphin watching. Very easy to just get the game started and "teach as you go".

OK kind of a game with similarities to Pirates Cove.  The unstable wooden boats were irritating to handle, and all those little stacks of cards all over the place...Played the game with two other adults and two ten year old girls so it was fun because they were having fun.

KL was one of our first alternatives to TTR. It soon proved to be a very decent "Light Medium" game and it sticks well to its theme : deep sea diving / treasure hunting (fishing?). The luck factor is consistent with the theme (no one can ever be sure of what lies beneath the surface, can they ?) and the risk taking part adds a nice little element of stress (trident or not trident ?). Light, fun, easy to get in, and reasonably replayable : Key Largo is one of those perfect "family games".

Such a good and thematic right game. You are at this island, and for 10 days you need to get as much money from those tourist as possible.. And there are many ways to get that money. 
Also a great family game.. It is not so hard, but if you have good competitors it will be way more difficult then you think...

Great game.  My 13 yr old has adopted it as her favorite game ahead of Munchkins.  It's not interactively competitive since each player is mostly unencumbered to choose how they want to spend their turn, but each other player's actions do or can have an impact on your strategy.  Each player is a boat captain looking for sunken treasure via numerous card piles which are randomly laid around the perimeter of the board.  Players dive for treasure but risk encountering a sea monster which will scare away your hired diver.  You can buy spears to kill it.  You can also buy equipment which allows you to take more treasure on a dive, or go dive on deeper ships.  During the game you will need to buy and sell stuff and prices are affected by how many players are doing the same actions.  A great, easy to learn game that is pretty fun.  The game has limited turns (10 game days) so it does not drag on.  Game components are nice looking with fun artwork.  This is a really good family game.

While not a bad game and not as chaotic as one might expect from Faidutti, I'm not certain if there is much replayability in this game.  With only 5 actions, I feel like it would only take a few plays to map out the best course for the game.  I'm not certain if there's more value to just taking risks in diving or in researching the dives.  There's a nice twist to selling your treasures as you will either want more people to be at the store or none at all depending on the treasure you're selling.  Things also cost more at the equipment shop and tavern if more people are present trying to buy stuff.  The key seems to be trying to find a pattern that doesn't match up with most of the other players.

You can definitely tell Bruno had a hand in this one. It definitely has his play style stamped all over it. I found the game kind of interesting and fun. Anytime you get to make monster noises in a game I bump up the score of the game, just for that.  The choices are interesting, and it can be fun finding treasures, and trying to out guess your opponents in where you go.  Needs a Puff card though.

Fun family game ; lots to do and plays fast. enjoyable.
Hidden choices with a morning/afternoon task mechanism like Jamaica. 

Best stuff is in the deep wrecks but these are also full of monsters. Shallow wrecks have no monsters and can be cleared out with an unprotected diver and a weight.

Encounter cards are good (assuming you remember to pick them up!!) Thief is a bit ineffective.

The board is completely superfluous, This is actually a card game.

Although there are strong mechanical similarities with Pirate's Cove, Key Largo is different enough to make both games worth owning: Key Largo is, as far as I can tell after one game, a good deal faster. There is less direct conflict but some interaction, and I would say there is a tad more strategy. Interestingly enough, this is a game that is more lucky once you include the advanced rules.

RATING: 4
I find some of the limits (like not being able to buy equipment before you have a diver) makes the starting round a bit scripted. If three or more players wants to get a diver as their first action, none of them can afford it. So do you risk it, knowing you might waste a turn if more people think the same way or do you collect money first so that you will afford it on your second action, knowing it will probably get expensive?

Once you've gotten started properly it could become an enjoyable experience, but a few things could wreck your fun, like losing your well prepared diver because you got two monsters in a row and each diver can carry one weapon (so to be safe you need a second diver to carry the second weapon) or spending serious money on equipment only to have other players steal some of your treasure.

For me personally it just wasn't all that enjoyable and could do with a rule tweak or two.

RATING: 5.5
A fairly light game of simultaneous action selection, exploration and push-your-luck.  Players outfit divers and send them searching for treasures.  Treasures are found at 3 different depths where the deeper depths produce better treasures but also more danger.  You'll need to purchase hoses to swim deeper, and tridents to fight off monsters.  

When you're at a store or selling treasures the number of opponents at that place effects the pricing (usually adversely).  You can purchase a round of beers which allow you to find out about treasures (check a deck of cards at a location and then reshuffle).

Only one person was able to purchase a diver in the first round of my first game and we found that this gave him an unfair advantage.  He was always a turn ahead of us and therefore did not need to compete in the other actions.  We thought this could be fixed if the designer just started everyone out with a diver.

Seemed more of a family game than a gamer's game which is not a terrible thing.

Simple family style game with quick turns and opportunities for large payouts. Somewhat few monsters, the largest tension source in the game, for how many tridents were included. Subtract two points if playing with the optional thief rules.

Not bad at all.  The thief option can be pretty devastating and blind diving can be dangerous, but there's a lot of fun stuff here.  I don't know about you, but most of the ships in my set can barely stand up.  I think I'm going to either file the bottoms or attach something like a washer..

Buy a diver and some equipment and go diving on wrecks for treasure to sell to the tourists.  Build up your diver over several turns to dive on the deeper wrecks where there is better treasure but also more risk from sea monsters.  There is some luck involved which I don't mind too much, although I suspect those that don't meet sea monsters are bound to win over those that do.  There is little player interaction (which I don't like).  Basically, you do your own thing while the other players do theirs.  I love the theme, the beautiful artwork and the bits.  It really felt like I was a treasure hunter in the Caribbean.  Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if we played each player at a time so we could watch other's adventures unfold (you tend to miss what the other player's are doing while you perform your own tasks), but that would have increased the downtime between turns. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Nice and original setting. No boring downtime: the simultaneous action idea is perfect to keep players attention high. The game offers some different short term strategies (but still not many enough to make it a very good game). Luck effect can be tuned down using the "beer" at the tavern. The dolphin bay, even with the optional cards, is still not very attractive.

Fun as a light simultaneous action selection game where selecting the wrong action won't completely destroy your plans.  There's definitely some timing elements in deciding when you no longer care about your divers getting eaten.  Drawing two consecutive monsters early can be brutal, though.  I'm not sure I really like the whole stealing mechanic, especially since they can always grab your valuable (deep-sea) stuff.

Components are not Language independant, but can be worked out easily after a couple of rounds. Has more fun-factor than when first reading the rules. But you do have to get your mind wrapped around the idea of the theme. Warping of boards, boats tip over. Components could be better, but it was still fun. We use the tourist cards variant to throw a little chaos into the mix. We rarely use the robber - usually say you can buy a tourist card for his cost if you are in the Siren's tavern, instead of robbing someone, but "getcha" games don't work well around my family.

(Rating based on one play) Imagine Pirate's Cove, but without the great pirate-y flavor, without the exciting ship combats, and with poorly constructed materials including a fit-together board that won't lie flat.  Full disclosure:  we stopped playing this game before finishing, because the majority at the table felt it not worth seeing through to the end.

You just can't help but compare this to Pirate's Cove.  At its core the game uses the same engine.  The art is undeniably as lovely, and I feel that this is certainly a better game, but at the end of the day this just isn't exciting.  

Everyone runs around doing their own thing, trying to avoid each other.  It isn't too hard to figure out what everyone is doing so that isn't even that tough.  

The only real interaction in the game is stealing from each other, and that gets irritating quickly. 

Build your guys up and dive.  Then sell the booty.  Repeat.

The game should have been much better than it actually was.

RATING: 8
A really fun family or light gamers' game.  A modern-day "sequel" to Pirate's Cove, which is a good game itself, but I like this game better as I think the player-interaction mechanics work very well here.  You are operating a treasure-hunting business using undersea divers, and you have 10 days to maximise your profits.  You choose two activities to do each day, with the players' hidden choices being simultaneously revealed.  Deep diving requires more equipment to be purchased and is more dangerous, but reaps more valuable finds in terms of treasure.  When you're really broke, some spare cash can be gained by showing tourists the dolphins.  There is even some highly simplified business economics in the game, as the cost of labour and equipment, the selling price of goods and treasure, and even the tourist returns, can vary with 'market forces'.  Great fun, nice components and artwork, clever mechanics, and with some strategy possible.  Thumbs up in my book! (Titanic Games edition)

RATING: 7
It's sort of like Pirate's Cove, with simultaneous action selection and various board locations to go do stuff. Everyone starts with 1 diver. The board locations allow you to get cash, buy equipment (hoses to dive to deeper wrecks, weights to stay down longer and grab more treasure, tridents to fight off monsters), hire new divers, buy drinks to hear rumors about wrecks (look through the cards in one of the wrecks), or sell treasures at market. Each round, everyone selects 2 actions, which will move your token to a specific location and allow you to take the action there. Reveal the first, then resolve in turn order. Then reveal the second action and resolve. Like Pirate's Cove, you're usually trying to go where others are not present -- purchases are more expensive if other buyers are present, and sales are generally less lucrative with other sellers present. Repeat this for 10 rounds; player with the most money wins the game.There's an advanced version which adds a thief (who presumably steals stuff from other players) and some random encounters (which do a variety of things, mostly good, I think) when you go to the money-earning spot ("go dolphin viewing"). The basic game is simple enough that I don't think we'd have had any problems jumping right into the full game.If you like Pirate's Cove but don't like the avoid-all-combat mentality in that game, Key Largo may be worth trying. You still generally want to avoid going to the same place as others, but you're not hurt terribly when that happens ... you just lose some cash (which doesn't feel as bad as getting blown away by cannons and being forced to retreat to Pirate's Cove with little/no gain). It's more about competition here than combat. Also, you can take measures (buy rumors to search a deck, buy equipment to fight monsters) to reduce the randomness. Still, and fitting with the theme, there is some randomness in which treasures you happen to collect.

Entertaining and very light, but still with enough going on to keep it mostly interesting.  Not worth owning to me, but I'd play it most of the time without complaint if someone else is interested in breaking it out.  

I think as long as you only played it a couple times a year, it would remain a fun little ride--more than that and the chaos and luck would far outweigh the fun. There is not much interaction beyond trying to guess the timing to either avoid the other players or join with them to sell artifacts.  there is no way to affect the progress of the other players except by using the theif action which is basically just a cheap, random shot.

Good family game. In some point similar to Thebes (drawing the trophys from tha bag and here the throphys in the cards). But in Key Largo its better. When you have trophys someone could steal them, and its better to sell the most trophys at the market.

Every player choose the action at random, but its not so important. Maybe at he begining of the game, when you don`t have so much money.

Seriously underrated.  It's 1500!  Are you freakin' kidding me.  This is a masterpiece of family gaming!  Tom Vasel says this game is "criminally not known.... It's very simple and fun and works very well as a family game."  He adds, "It's a game I wish people knew more about."  

This is the area where BGG simply sucks!  It does not represent me or my family's tastes.  If you don't feel like sitting through 3 hours of brain-straining mental gymnastics, ignore the vast majority of BGG's "top rated games."  It is so misleading.  These games are often NOT fun.  I've been working with BGG now for 7 years.

I have played over 400 different games over the last few years.  I tend to focus on family games as I have a family of younger people.  Ignore the paper money--it's fine and of quality.  The rules are clear, the system smooth as silk, the choices many, but NEVER overwhelming.  My daughter and wife just fell in love.  Theme is not only present, but aggressively there.  We started off with theft and dolphin bay cards in play.

If you have a family with 7-17 year olds, get it.  If you're a hardcore gamer, skip it unless you want some light fun.  This would be an excellent gateway game as well.

What a tragedy that this fine game designer passed away so early.  If this is a sample of his early works, who knows...

Again, a masterpiece of family gaming!

Best with more players as there is more overlap at the market, tavern and equipment store. Very nice looking and functional game board, very nicely illustrated cards. This is a light, fast playing card game with a board thrown in to track the day of the week, really. The game itself is entertaining as it exudes theme. Players try to time their stops at the various locations so that nobody else is there to jack of the purchase prices or decrease the sales prices or dive at a profitable wreck before somebody else nabs the good treasures. Watch out for the monsters though as they can really affect your game. There is significant luck, but this can be somewhat mitigated by examining wreck piles by buying a round of drinks in the tavern. This is a solid 45-60 minute game, suitable for families, but probably not deep enough for serious gamers.

Really read the rules and see what you think or at least try and give it a play before dismissing it.

Key Largo is a double-guessing game, like Paul Randles' other game, Pirate's Cove. Every morning, each player secretly decide what he will do the coming day - take tourists dolphin watching, search a wreck for treasures, sell treasures at the market, buy equipment at the local shop, or go to the tavern to hire more divers and listen to the rumours. It's also a light management game, where you start with little cash and must make your money grow through fruitful investment. The winner is the richest player when the hurricane breaks through and stops all diving around the island.

Bruno Faidutti & Mike Selinker & Paul Randles; Created by Paul Randles, designer of Pirate's Cove, and developed by Mike Selinker and Bruno Faidutti, Key Largo transports players into the Florida Keys in 1899. As the new century dawns, players ply the thriving trade of finding treasures in shipwrecks around the island. Before a hurricane hits, players need to search the many shipwrecks and sell the lost treasures to the island denizens for as much cash as possible

Key Largo is easy to teach, nice to look and plays quickly. If I had to make the Pirate's Cove/Key Largo comparison I'd give the points to Pirate's Cove just because the possible ship battles are more exciting than the possibility of price increases at the shop. Although on the flipside the idea of searching for buried treasure is better than just building your ship.

++ Beautiful artwork and quick playing time.
+  Easily employed as a gameway game (i.e., most money wins).
-  The game has a very large footprint.
-- Even with the built-in ways to reduce the luck, like paying to look through a stack of cards, the luck is a bit overwhelming and often makes one wish for more control.

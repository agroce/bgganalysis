A fresh and enjoyable combination of X-Wing and Warhammer fantasy. The movement and dials used to perform actions are easy to understand and provide streamlined game play. The connecting trays allow players to move large phalanxes with ease, not having to spend several minutes throughout a game scooting individual models. This is my new suggestion for those who want a fantasy war game without the complication and price point of Games Workshop's Warhammer fantasy.

*Laughing at the few negative comments.* This game is great! It's a good into to war gaming for new players, but it's also a nice simple game for experienced players to play as well. I love the X-Wing system and I love it in a fantasy setting. This game is picking up steam at my shop now because Legion is getting a lot of buzz. I think it'll become more popular after Legion releases but it's up to the shops, FFG and the players to promote the game!

Update :  After much more play, I think this game settles into highly predictable and repetitive patterns fairly quickly.  The initial tactical depth with upgrade cards quickly devolves into a list of the best, must take options unless you are going for a riskier themed build.  Because you don't know what your objectives are going to be prior to army selection, you need to build a general and balanced force.  There are obvious best choices for such a force.

The expansions just seem to hammer home some new trick or technique that quickly becomes tiresome.  It's like a CCG expansion that pushes one new card mechanic to death.

Everyone that plays minis games that I know would rather play 40k or Armada.
------------------------------------------

Movement templates create more problems than they solve from a measured movement system.

Terrain is also problematic and can be pretty unrealistic in some situations.

Combat is fast and interesting and the upgrade system makes up for lack of unit variety.

Heroes are a major aspect of the game, most armies will contain one hero of about 50 points, which is 1/4 or the army point value for a standard game.  Units can also include heroes as upgrades.  Expect "herohammer" style games, rather than troop based games.  Some troops will be important but it looks like heroes and magic will dominate this game, which is proper for fantasy, imo.  That's a great thing for a fantasy game.

It remains to be seen what impact magic will have in the game, but early previews indicate it will be substantial.

Miniature quality is rather dodgy and certainly not up to quality  mass battle fans have come to expect as the norm, especially at the price FFG ins charging for these figures..

Not much variety in the base box, buy two or wait for expansions,

This is the wargame for me.  It doesn't take that long to play compared to its competition I.e warhammer.  The cost is also cheaper for the most part.  The rules are also easy enough that none war game players can play like my 11 year old daughter and son.  I will be sticking with this to fill my wargame itch.

This game have a warhammer killer taste...Shorter game, streamlined but deep rules, miniatures are excellent ( under games workshop but very very nice), and order system is very strategic and fun. Simply a blast !  Played on 1vs 1 abd 2 vs 2 with two box.

I had the chance to play this at OrcCon 2017, and wow I was blown away. This takes all the miniature wargaming I've done (such as Warhammer), streamlines and adds some cool tweaks, and finished up in a very short timeframe. Assuming this game gets all the expansions that I hope it will, this will surely become my go to wargame for fantasy battles, completely replacing Warhammer, 9th Age, etc etc. I enjoyed the mechanics THAT much.

It has good potential and Fantsy Flight has a good rep for fixing and balancing their more popular games. As it stands upon release though its an awkward attempt in a table top wargame's genre. The movement is "almost" satisfying on a tactical level, but shoring up, terrain, and juggling dial action movement/attack doesn't feel like a true wargame (I play Starwars Armada from this company, andI find it much more satisfying). As is Rune Wars is more like a good beer and peanuts board game with excellent visuals. It is fun but trying to approach it with any real kind of strategy is going to be met with either disappointment or frustration.  The bones of the game are excellent in design and I look forward to the game becoming a bit more polished once it''s been out for 6-12 months.

Lots of potential, but the core set feels like a lcg core set in that it feels incomplete - you will need 2 and expansions to really enjoy the full game. Great miniatures and fun gameplay

War-games usually have rather complicated rulesets. Runewars (RW) its an exception. Contrary to the philosophy of most war-games, the rules of RW are pretty simple so you can actually focus in tactics and strategy instead of rules lore. Furthermore, no matter the size of your army a battle will take only about two hours, which allows you to play more games and try different strategies than with most other war-games.

When I bought the game I realized the miniatures weren't going to be painted. I'm ok playing with unpainted miniatures. I didn't realize they wouldn't be assembled!

$100 to spend hours assembling and gluing miniatures instead of playing the bloody game? No thanks! I'll stick with the painted and assembled X-Wing and Armada miniatures. 

Waste of $100.

Very interesting take on the miniatures wargame. Combines several of FFG's great standards like the Xwing movement system, custom dice use, upgrade cards, and so on. If handled right, can see this having long legs.

Good choices for units and the game doesn't feels too long thanks to the limited turns. Strategy is more important than luck in this game due to the Interesting combat system only few dices.

2 core boxes bought. Not much of a painter these days due to bad eyesight, but the game hits the table several times per week and it is just marvelous. This is FFG flipping GW the bird - having streamlined a fantasy rank % file game and created a system that solves all those issues WHFB have had since Day 1. The movement templates are great, coming in second only to Star Wars Armada's system. Are there issues? Sure there are, but they will most probably be solved in the first FAQ.

This is a fast, mass-combat rank & file game playable in two hours. Combat is hard, the upgrade system is great, and you will not need to buy a new rule book and army books as soon as something new is released. This is pure heaven for an old WHFB player like me. 

Recommended!

The base box is ok just to try the game but to play, you have to own two boxes for now. It will be easy when more armies and units will be release.
I cannot understand how a miniatures game could be develop like a classic boardgame. I think it's a big mistake. Hope it will not be a fatal mistake.

This was not the game I hoped it would be. It takes a great deal of attention to play well... more than 90% of possible opponents will devote to a single game. It is very dependent on the IP and the fiddly bits. You really can't use existing figures to play varied games. Because of many of the parts taken from X-Wing and Warhammer, it is one of those punitive games to newbies. Veteran players won't lose very many games, but will quickly drive opponents away from this game in frustration.

I was always curious about rank & file wargames, but felt intimidated by their complexity and salty prices. With Runewars I finally give it a chance. Its easier, more intuitive rules, with similarities to games such as x-wing, helps a lot. And the price/value is much more accessible than any other wargame out there.

My first foray into miniatures, so perhaps veterans should take my comments with a grain of salt.

I really like it!  Quick, simple, swingy (in the good dramatic kind of way), fun and engaging.  The minis are also really nice, and I appreciate that they really don't need to be painted (beyond spray painting them to match the colours for the board game, which is a nice touch).

FFG was smart in making a minis game that is very approachable to board gamers.  Let's see how well the gamble (which likely cost them their valuable Games Workshop licenses) pays off.

So, do I jump down the rabbit hole...?

This game is the best miniatures game I have had the pleasure of playing. The dial system is fast and fun. The turn order based on initiated makes each round fun and engaging as each player gets to act multiple times during a round instead of one person doing their whole turn, then the other. Highly recommend playing.

GAME: Mush! Mush!: Snow Tails 2
RANK: 2905
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Wow!
Snow Tails was already good, but here we see some serious improvements. A little lighter at first sight, and indeed playing faster, but at the same time even more interesting through the new buildings, and more tense (runayway leader is no big issue here any more) through the new bonus rule than it's predecessor.
While in Snow Tails the moving mechanic was more complex and maybe a bit more interesting, it was pretty obvius that you wanna try to get to the front from beginning, while in Mush Mush buildings an new bonus rules allow for other strategies, too (depending on the race course also). So while feeling lighter, Mush Mush is even more versatile and strategically interesting.

Very nice components also.

After now 5 plays I think, this is maybe the best racing game there is! Races are usually really close and thrilling, with many position changes.
You need to know the game, though, to put building and trees on the course in a way that they pimp up the game to its full height!

P.S.: I recommend track 2 (with spur start) for a quick introductory game, and track 8 for a more challenging experience.

Essentially an expansion to [b]Snow Tails[/b], this adds a few more tracks and variants.  The player dice keep the race very close.  The building rules are cool, if a little too much, physically.

My opinions are the same as for Snow Tails because there's not much difference between the two games, and I'm not fond of racing games.  I also don't care for the player elimination aspect of the game because a person can get knocked out quickly and through little fault of their own gameplay (i.e., bad card draws).

Neat, quick racing game.  Concept of sled dogs and how the mechanics deal with this theme are well-done. Trees are a nice effect. Not sure about replability, but I enjoyed my play of this game.

Being a big fan of Snow Tails, I was really hoping for a cool development on the game.  However, this just felt a bit phoned in.  A couple of very minor tweaks that didn't really result in anything all that much different.

A couple changes seemed negative.  First off, the loss of modular set-up is a downer.  There's also a rule change that makes the penalty for hitting another sled almost nothing, which seemed really silly.  We were often hitting other sleds on purpose for tactical advantage, which is really odd.

On the positive side, the addition of buildings you can stop at that give you something for stopping there was nice.  Also, the bonus die is an upgrade over the bonus movement from Snow Tails.

In the end, this is all incredibly minor, however, and doesn't make the game a different experience than its predecessor.  I'll simply add the variant buildings to Snow Tails, and play Snow Tails with the new bonus die rules and dump this version.  I really like the Lamont Brothers and a lot of the stuff they've created, but overall, it just seems like they didn't have a game for Essen, so they mailed this one in instead.

RATING: 7.5
Racing game where cards played determine your speed and your steering. Looks gorgeous (an almost christmaslike cover). You can play with up to eight, but personally I'd play with 3 to a max of 5 to give everyone a chance of winning. If you're ahead, it's difficult to loose that position, although there is a small catchup mechanism. Winner can often be determined a few rounds before the end unfortunately, so fingers crossed for a tight race :)

A fast-playing follow up to Snow Tails that allows you to dive in for a single race or compete over a three-route championship. Includes a massive oversized board with multiple tracks on both sides, new bonus movement, four polyresin buildings, proper scale model trees with bases, no brakes (as advertised above!) and less math.

racespel met mooi artwork. je verplaatst je slee door het spelen van 1 kaart of 2 kaarten van dezelfde waarde. de slee gaat evenveel stappen vooruit als de som van de waarde op de twee kaarten. je slee gaat evenveel stappen naar links of rechts als het verschil in waarde tussen de 2 kaarten. zo moet je objecten zien te ontwijken en naar de finish racen.

This game HAS to be the most good-looking game at Essen in 2013 with its model pine trees and resin snowy buildings and the lovely massive board with tracks everywhere. And it is a really exciting race game with simple card play determining move and drift. I never played the original Snow Tails game but apparently this remake is a simpler affair. And it really hits the spot as an Ave-Ceasar type card-driven race game. A perfect winter warmer of a game.

I liked Snow Tails so I was hoping for something similar with a few nice improvements. Well, similar it is, but I'm not so sure about the improvements. Simplifying the card play a little is certainly okay although I never found the old one very onerous to begin with. The new trees and houses are mostly gimmicks and don't add much (or at all, and they do look very much out of place). The modular board in Snow Tails was nice but the new one isn't too bad, either.

What I miss most, however, are the speed limits in corners. When race games primarily focus on gaining top speed first and preferably keeping that for the entire race they are kind of missing their climax. In addition, people sometimes complained about run-away leader issues in Snow Tails. Getting rid of the speed limits only serves to make that more prominent. Much prefer the original game.

Finally, a racing game that's actually pretty quick to play. I don't know why, but overlong racing games (which almost all of them are) are especially offensive to me. 
This one's quick and delightful--a great mix of luck, hand management, and forward planning. Very expensive, though.

I was really surprised to see how much better this actually works than Snow Tails. No need for Big Paws, it really is a faster experience, the numbers are easier to grog. And fast gameplay is essential in making this fantastic racer feel even more like a race than before. Well done, fine sirs.

Mush! Mush! the successor to Snow Tails has some pro's and con's. Getting rid of the brakes makes the game much more accessible. The trees and buildings are not really necessary but they look nice. What doesn't look as nice as it used to is the track and the sleighs. Putting together a track with various tiles just looks so much nicer than marking it on a board. And having little sleigh player board in front of you, also looked much nicer than just three cards. But those are all minor things which don't change the fact that it's still a very fun racing game.

I am completely baffled by the price tag.  $120.00?  For a light, quick racing game?  This game does not need ceramic houses and to scale trees with 10,000 actual pine needles that fall off each tree.

If it had card board trees and houses and sold for $40 I would order it right now, today.  Everyone I played this with at BGG Con loved it.  This is an easy to teach, fun to play game that should be in rotation in every gaming group in the country, but for $120.00?   I'll pass and it's a shame.

Not strictly better than the original Snow Tails, but definitely better for some groups for its faster play time and fewer mathematical variables. I played with six players and I wouldn't play with more unless everyone played very quickly. Turn taking games are just too long between turns for 7 or more players and 5 or 6 players make the track sufficiently busy. That being said, I preferred the original with 3 or 4 players, whereas Mush! Mush! plays generally very well with 5 or 6. The removal of the brake element also removes pretty much all of the original's brain tickling cleverness of finding the solution to a sticky situation usually through a clever combo of brake and dog taking you across a brake line just right. This never happens in Mush! Mush! simply because, if you ever play more than one card, you can only go straight ahead. The bonus die works well, but so did the balanced bonus from the original game. I could see adding a savable bonus die to the original Snow Tails just to discover if it's fun.

If you own Snow Tails, there's no game-play reason to also own this as it's essentially the same experience, with some minor variations - no brakes, a catch-up mechanism, some special spots which may or may not come into play. The bits are bigger and shinier so that might be it, but I prefer making my own board rather than using the pre-configured tracks on the single board that's offered here. Otherwise it's the same process, with the same comment from Snow Tail, being: Here's a race game I enjoy. It doesn't have a cracking pace, but there's a nice decision to make every turn on how to manage your card hand to set speed and turn power, whilst giving yourself good options to manage same on the next turn. And there's smiles to be had watching sleds go horribly wrong occasionally. Still a good game, just not worthy of the pimping up that's been done here, in my eyes.

This is a fairly simple, nice and fun racing game. The components of the game are great. The game board is really impressive and the houses and trees really look nice.
Each player has a sled pulled by two dogs which are printed on two cards.
You manage your sled with huskies by placing one card or two cards with the same value. The sled goes forward as many spaces as the total value of the two cards and your sled goes left or right as many spaces the difference in the values of the two cards. And that is how you try to avoid objects and to steer your vehicle towards the finish.

For a game that looks as childlike and simple as it does, this game keeps you thinking furiously all the way to the end! 
There is no "down time" as a player is always thinking of what to do next, which I like a lot.

I like that MushMush! gives a lot of the feel of RoboRally without the interminable stopping to see who  has the highest number on a card and therefore gets to go first.  This is streamlined fun, Fun, FUN!

2 plays, 4er

This is a pretty nice simplification of the original game:
- no brake card
- added a d6 bonus die: starts with number showing your rank. During game, may either spend die to add it's pips to your movement OR, if dogs are balanced, you may update die to show your current race position.
The components aren't quite as good: board instead of customizable track pieces, cards instead of sled tile. But there were some cool little pine tree plastic bits, and 4 huge buildings to put on the board (not sure if they came with the game or were custom components?). 

Quite fun, although I need to go play the original again!

RATING: 4
A simple racing game that works well enough but I never felt engaged; it was always a solo game with players acting as temporary obstacles. Turn order has a huge impact on narrow/cluttered tracks and the catch-up dice is never quite enough to make up for that. The hand management aspect is limited at best and luck of the draw can ruin even the best player. I think kids could find something fun here but I'll steer clear.
--

The rulebook is of the abominable big font, too many pages variety but the content seemed fine. The game board can be hard to follow at times as the track markings are very thin but otherwise provides a nice variety of tracks.  The component quality is fine (bar the trees shedding everywhere) but the mix of wood, cardboard, ceramics and plastic makes for an incongruous mix.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The bonus die is an improvement over the original Snow Tails, but rather than selling this whole game for 50 Euros, I'd much rather have seen the buildings and bonus dice sold for 10.

The removal of the brake oddly makes things much simpler and the new tracks are much more stable whilst still offering a decent amount of variety. My main problem with Snow Tails remains in Mush! Mush! though and that is that a runaway leader will never be caught unless they do something stupid. Get out to an early lead and you're probably going to win. That's kind of an issue in a racing game.

All in all, I think I prefer Snow Tails to this one.  Snow tails is a little more gamery I think, and still not hard to get.  But this one is prettier, and the board is nice. And the game is just as fun, just a little less overhead I guess. 

Also, this one can handle a lot more players.  So it has that going for it.  In the end, I still thing I prefer the original, and that's the one that I kept.

I really like Snow Tails, and Mush Mush presents a nice variant of that game. Personally I like Snow Tails a bit better, because it feels more "gamey", more involved. MM is lighter and therefore probably better suited for families. Unless you are a really big fan of either game, however, I see no need to own both. Also, I really do not like the components in MM, except for the board. The crude buildings and generic trees make the game look thrown together.

Love the new rules, don't like the new trees. I preferred the modular track, but the new board is fine. The new cards go from 0-4 (a couple of 5s can be earned in-game), so the old brake card is no longer needed. It's still all about assigning cards to each dog & pulling the sled around corners with uneven values, while balancing them up on the straights to gain bonus speed.

Overall, I think I'll play the new rules & cards on the old track & trees... 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Interesting race game that seems a bit short. I understand that multiple races could be strung together, but it seems odd that each individual track is so short. Given great racing game titles, such as Formula D, Rallyman, and Giro Galoppo, already in my collection, this is a pass.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Compared to Snow Tails, it's faster. However, gone are the speed limits in corners. When race games primarily focus on gaining top speed first and preferably keeping that for the entire race they will almost certainly miss any climactic finish. People sometimes complained about run-away leader issues in Snow Tails. Getting rid of the speed limits has only served to make that more prominent.

It now has a big board and is less mathy. Simplifying the card play is okay, although I never found the old one very onerous to begin with.

The new trees and houses are mostly gimmicks and don't add much (or at all, and they do look very much out of place). The wiry/plastic Model Railway trees are a step backwards from Snow Tails' functional wooden pieces. These were never designed to be manhandled in the first place, and shed bits all over the place. Likewise the pot houses are very rustic affairs, with crude features blobbed on.

The predefined tracks are now limited, and far too short. You can make an amalgamation of longer tracks with Snow Tails, and if you re-use passed sections, you can extend forever.

Playing against more than 4-5 players is not for me, so the temptation and lure of an 8-player game is non existent.

No 'Leap of Death' tile either. WTF?!?!?

It could easily have been released as an expansion/update. So I made my own version [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/image/1812365/zombiegod][b]Too Mush Snow![/b],[/url] which works just as good with the Asmodee version.

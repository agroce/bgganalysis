I don't think this plays well solo. I've only played the first few scenarios with the solo rules, but ended up being so underwhelmed that I'm not likely to try any more scenarios that way. I still find the game interestingly different than anything else I own, and hope to try it against an opponent.

Racking up a number of additional plays on this, and I do like it. But it does appear that the replay value of any given scenario is nearly zero. Fortunately many different scenarios are included (it's possible later scenarios may have a little more depth). If you're learning/teaching the game, make sure to rotate through the scenarios so as not to burn out. Yes, this would be a natural iPad or other tablet game; the "umpire" player doesn't do much, and this may be the game's ultimate downfall. But it is quite short, and I think there is a niche.
---
Initial rating. Pros: plays very quickly (30 minutes for scenario 3), and is a pretty streamlined game system that does a really good job of evoking the feel of the tactical situation. The game can be tense and the nightfighters are under significant time pressure. There are interesting tactics to the radar search game. Cons: Even at scenario 3, there just doesn't seem like there is a whole lot of game here, as players react to the events created by dice rolls. Three bombers enter in a staggered fashion, radars pretty quickly vector the fighter in the right general direction, then searchlights fix them and the fighter tallies one. You get a 1-2 shots at one or two of the bombers, and if you roll well, you win. There just isn't much variability here, and the "umpire" player really doesn't do much. Yeah, I know, he's an umpire and not a player and it's fast enough to turn it around, but still - giving him a couple minor decisions from time to time would have been nice.

Anyway, I do find the system and the variety very appealing, and am optimistic that later, more involved scenarios will allow for more tactical nuance and make for an actual game in addition to a fun experience (and let me raise my rating). But even up to scenario 3 we're still looking at "learning-the-system" scenarios with very limited replayability and not "interesting game" scenarios.

The bomber plans his bombing runs and can see all, the nightfighter searches the sky using his available radar and searchlights to detect the bombers. An incredible exploration of the development of night fighting and   radar technologies during the war. The players role is vary simple, yet a maddenning puzzle of where is the enemy!

Played only solitare variant. Very deep solitare experience but of course not for everyone. It's more a air nightfighting simulation and cat&mouse game than a fun & simple wargame. Needs some time to learn & remember all the advanced rules.

This was my first taste of war-gaming. 

The history, technology, teamwork, strategy and tactics have completely engaged my imagination and intellectual curiosity! 

From this game, I've discovered that this genre may be the genre for me and my family who love this game as well. This game really provides a strong feeling of being a ground control intercept team directing fighters to shoot down bombers. It is engaging, thematic, and wonderfully presented. 

As newcomers to war-gaming my family found the rules extremely clear (we had just one question and common sense gave us the answer and the author confirmed our instincts for us). The components are magnificent and the topic is fascinating. We've played this game more times and more consecutive times, than any other recent purchase! Clean rules and fast game play that is immersive.

This is a gem!

Well it showed up in 2011 :) but the game is still a lot of fun, I umpired my father in scenario 3 and he managed to detect , and shoot down all 3 RAF bombers, " This is a GREAT game he says!"   :)

RATING: 7
Great campaign system, though the missions get a bit repetitive (but they probably also were in real life). The toughest decision during the mission is often when and whether to let a bomber go after you hunted him for miles and finally tallied him or even damaged him, but you are nearing the edge of the zone. This gets even more dramatic when playing with the optional rules 28.2 (alerted bomber speeding up) and 28.4 (attack position).

RATING: 9
After years of playing games with ever increasing amounts of bling and swag, here comes this gem of a game which boasts fewer pieces than Chess.  Nightfighter is a wonderful experience of cat and mouse where most of the action is felt more than seen, much like the actual pilots being simulated.  The game is learned through a series of scenarios which introduce rules gradually.  The challenge increases as well as the tension as you wander in the dark skies looking for the enemy.  Flicking through the rules, I can see it only gets better.  I love the way that the tools of detection are explained, but you have to figure out the best way to use them.  A thinking man's delight.

Splendid game.

Solitaire Rules/Scenarios
I just love the idea of nightfighter 
action in WWII.

RATING: 8
Just finished Scenario 3 of [thing=33924][/thing] solitaire, using Phillip Sabin's Solitaire Rules, the goal of the mission was to shoot down 1 bomber for a win and 2 bombers for a decisive victory.  I almost managed to shoot down the 3rd bomber on the last hex exiting the map, but roll snake eyes(!) and the last British Wellington bomber escaped.

The game took about 2 hours, after shooting the 2nd bomber I had the rules and sequence of play down pat and I needn't reference the rulebook any more, using the player-aid instead.  

Had a really good time, the solitaire rules does give you a great sense of fog-of-war, it won't replace an umpire since you sort of know where the phantom markers are (instead of just blank space) but it comes pretty close & integrates with the original rules very well.  

Maneuvering the nightfighter was surprisingly important as you need to be in the same square as the bomber and facing the same direction to initiate combat.  That last fighter got away because I had to do a U-turn to get into position and wasted a 2nd firing opportunity.  

Had a really refreshingly good time with this one.  Extremely low counter density and quick playing and with a decent simulation of Nightfighting, makes for a great recipe.

I am going ahead now and trying a scenario that incorporates the rest of the rules concerning Airborne Radar & Altitude.  See you in the night skies over Dresden.

originally I was not interested in this title due to the need for an umpire.  surprisingly, being the umpire is fun, esp. since the game plays fast.

the theme of the game is certainly cool, and I think the gameplay seems to capture the feel well.

I think the campaign might be the most interesting way to play.

Scenario 1A:  2 nightfighter victories; the non-variant scenario seems like an exercise in futility, while the variant scenario seems a bit too easy.  good learning scenarios though.

Scenario 3:  1 nightfighter victory; decisive victory was denied due to poor tallys, poor gunnery, and finally a blinding Wellington explosion that made the nightfighter fly off the map.  fun scenario.

Note that this rating is based purely on Nightfighter as a game, not on my opinions of the designer's antics on BGG.

I bought this game directly from GMT in 2011 - it was one of my numerous P500's. 

During the past year and a half I have read the rules several times and finally, a few weeks ago I gave the game a try.

All I can say now is that I regret, that I've waited for so long.

This game is just OUTSTANDING!

I love the theme, I love the setting and the narrative feeling during each play. The game is full of details and playing it feels almost like flying a real night mission during WW2.

The solitaire system works great and despite a rulebook full of details (an extremely well written rulebook I must say!) the game just flows!

My first play made me say "Wow!", my second made me ask "Is this really such a good game"? Now, after nine plays under my belt I can consciously answer: this is THE BEST GAME THAT I HAVE EVER PLAYED. 

If I could give an 11 or a 22 it would be to this game. 

Absolutely brilliant!

Rating based on a single play of Scenario 2. Normally I get a few more plays under my belt before I rate something but I really like what I see. Scenario 2 was indeed hard and the player ended up losing, but it showed off the meat of the game and we're really intrigued and look forward to playing again.

The components are nice and typical GMT quality, and the rule book leaves no room for confusion and it's nice and clear.

This pre-order was a real shot in the dark (sorry for the pun) since I wasn't sure how well the dynamic between the player & umpire would pan out, and how fun that would be, but it turns out for the player it's a nice complex puzzle and for the umpire it's not only fun to watch, but also to have a hand in directing certain things to up or lower the difficulty for the player.

Based on about a dozen playtest games, I expect this game is going to be a big hit. Fans of Lee's earlier games will relish the historical detail, innovative mechanics, and gorgeous graphics. Those who consider Downtown or The Burning Blue to be weightier than they like will find here a fast-playing game with programmed instruction providing a gentle learning curve and a moderate complexity level that's easily within the reach of a teenage wargamer. Could make an excellent first wargame for players new to the hobby (assuming at least modest interest in the subject).

[later] Just received the production game, and it's really a graphic tour de force, very atmospheric and the components look great.

I had lots of problems with finding opponents for this game. Mostly because of the very specific theme - few people are actually interested in night air warfare of WW2. But then I showed Nightfighter to my girlfriend and one friend and they both enjoyed it! So even for people who are not interested in the theme this game is fun.

I personally like this game mostly because of the theme. I love WW2 warbirds and Nightfighter gives me a chance to actually feel the thrill of air combat. Beware that the game is very unusual due to its asymmetry. It's actually a game for one player with the other player being an all-knowing Game Master.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A hard game for me to rate. The physical presentation is good and the rules are well written, clear and concise. The game is very mechanical in execution and doesn't "feel" like a game about nightfighter combat. It feels more like an abstract "hide and seek" game. Strip off the theme and the system could easily be used to represent other "hide and seek" situations (a submarine hunt comes to mind).

I like the game system but I'm rubbish as the Player. I don't have the patience (or the ability?) to take the information given and deduce where the bombers must/might be. Of course that's not the game's fault, so I shouldn't let my inability to play well effect the rating. I do enjoy the Umpire role, watching the Player flying aimlessly about or tracking down a bomber for the kill. It's fun to have the "all knowing" view of the game (and trying to mess with the players mind...). 

So in the end, I'll initially rate this game a '6'. It's not as evocative of the subject as I would like and I may not be able to play it well, but it's still a pretty good game.

Great for some quick two player games and it is challenging for the player going up against the umpire the first time or two.  After that it becomes a probability exercise and it loses some of its luster.

The kind of game that you break out every once in awhile, but I can't see myself playing it several times in a row.

I really wanted to like this game.  One play of Scenario #3 was enough for me.  The umpire has nothing to do, the bombers are to easy to find, once found it is just throwing some dice around to see if you win.  In the end it just seemed like neither player had any choices to make, it was all up to a few dice throws.  If the bombers had been more fun to find or the umpire player got to do some things it would be at least interesting.  Sad really...

Very good at what it does, which is simulate the hide-and-seek of WW2 night air combat.  If you play the scenarios in chronological order you can see the development of tactics and technology.

The rules are very clean.  The game is easy to learn and quick to play.  (At my last session I played 4 games in 2.5 hours.)  The only reason I don't give the game a 10 is because I'm not yet sure I'll stay as addicted to it as I am to, say, Twilight Struggle.

RATING: 8
I've only played with Phil Sabin's solitaire variant, and that's what I'm rating + commenting. I doubt you'd find many people willing to play the umpire for a large number of scenarios.

As a [i]strategy game[/i] it's very random with often obvious decisions, and it has some physically tedious repetitive fiddliness. (On the plus side, they often last only a quarter or half hour, so it's easy to play multiple times in a row!)

As a [i]story/experience[/i] and [i]historically educational simulation[/i] I enjoy playing it! I have learned a lot about a subject (night fighters hunting bombers) of which I was previously very ignorant! The scenarios give a good feel of the significant effects of moon, cloud, radar, searchlights, various aircraft speeds, etc, and there are several pages of historical notes too!

So it's a bit tricky to rate - if you want to learn about (and simulate) this subject of nightfighting, then I recommend it. If you want a competitive fun wargame with interesting strategizing, then I don't recommend it for that purpose.

The game rules are pretty well written, but I nonetheless found them confusing at first, I think simply because I was ignorant of the concepts and terminology of nightfighting! Then Phil Sabin's solitaire rules change a lot of the rules and introduce additional initially confusing notions! But after a few plays, I got it down fine, and scenarios move along easily and quickly!

I came up with a less physically fiddly way of handling the bombers' levels of uncertainty: remove the bomber counter and put a blue tracking marker (only) to indicate low uncertainty, or put a AI radar/tally/radar/searchlight marker to indicate a fixed bomber.

RATING: 7.8
Absolutely underrated and unknown wargame. Despised by regular wargamers because of being "too soft" and rejected by boardgamers because of being a "too complicated" wargame, saying so even withouth having played it.

I love its length (short for a wargame, around 30-60 minutes per scenario) and its mechanics. The game confronts a fighter against some bombers invading an aerial space during the World War II. The player using the fighter must use as efficiently as possible all the resources (the airplane, terrestrial and aerial radars, searchlights...) he has available to find and destroy the invading bombers.

The game combines a thrilling phase of deduction of the location of the bombers, and a phase of pursuit and combat.

One of my favourites not being myself a regular wargamer.

Easily taught, fast playing, tense. Great for getting in several sessions in an evening. I've played this both as a playtester and post-publication played several games with my son and we both enjoyed it a lot.

Any similarities claimed between Nightfighter and Risk are a sure indication that the "reviewer" has played neither.

An absolutely absorbing game that oozes history and technology. Some may find it frustrating at first as they search in vain for the bomber streams. It is A game of logic and detection that rewards a structured and disciplined approach by the player search for the nember flights. The games are quick playing and even the larger scenarios could be played twice in an evening. A gem, an absolute gem.

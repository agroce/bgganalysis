If you're at all interested in wargames, even if you're not a Civil War geek, you're really missing a treat if you haven't played the Great Campaigns of the American Civil War series. It's a rare wargame that can combine modest complexity, tremendous playability, and solid historicity all it one package, and GCACW is one of those games. The GCACW series is one of the best wargames in terms of giving you a reasonable feel for the how these campaigns were fought, the unwieldy and large armies deployed against each other and the resultant bloody battles.

Grant Takes Command is one of the best entries in the series too, with an awesome set of scenarios and campaign games that capture the grand sweep of the bigger games while still being quite playable (the biggest one should be doable in two long sessions, the smaller one in just one full day. The longer one is better). Grant Takes Command is a tremendous game and was my pick for best pre-20th C. wargame, but the more accessible but somewhat less impressive Wilderness War is likely to sweep the 2001 awards. The only knock on the GCACW games is that unlike many of the big operational/battle games (OCS, EFS, CWB, RSS, GBACW), GCACW just doesn't scale at all beyond two players unfortunately. Not a drawback in my book, but it depends on what you like.

I own it, I love the color coded counters, I wish they'd color coded the commanders to their Corps though.  

The map is the least attractive of the franchise with roads being especially difficult to "make out" - a critical flaw.  The errors in the hexes along the N-S map overlap are an annoyance too: missing roads, creeks that are rivers, change of terrain mid hex.


The engagements consist of huge stacks (or cluttered force tracking cards) and maneuver - the series' great strength is downplayed in many scenarios as the antagonists hammer away in set piece battles.

Probably my least favorite of the GCACW gang.  To my mind most GTC scenarios highlight the greatest weaknesses of the system: multiple unit states, crazy tall stacks in tiny hexes, assault system fiddleness, downtime, dice dependence ... while being completely devoid of avenues that highlight the system's strengths: maneuver, sweeping operational actions, uncertainty, narrative.

If someone asked me to make them hate GCACW, I'd use scenarios from this title.

I gave each scenario a try, and then relegated this title to the shelf.  Pulling out SiV, the antithesis of GTC, just to cleanse my palate and reaffirm my love of the system.

update: 
I am giving this title another chance with a new opponent after having enjoyed BaC.  The comments below are based upon these recent sessions.

Bethesda Church :star::nostar::nostar::nostar::nostar:
We gave this scenario a try and had a fun time ... because (a) the CSA kept winning initiative and (b) Early kept rolling well on +0 attacks.  So the first turn was fun for the CSA.  But by then they'd basically won (courtesy of the dice) and we had two turns of stack leaning against stack hammer fest.  Had just one of Early's attacks gone wrong his whole maneuver would have been thwarted, his forces out of action for the duration of the scenario, and the static slug fest started that much sooner.  

In many ways, this scenario is a poster child of what I dislike in GTC.  First, the scenario seems decided by the dice.  Have a great run as we did, where four or five rolls go one side's way at the start and this sort of scenario is in the can.  You have stacks of units in an area that quite literally could be enlarged 3x and still fit on an 8.5 inch x 11 inch map ... but with hex sizes three times as big.  This would be great, but with everyone under entrenchment markers, and all the VP hexes within a 5 hex radius you have a battle that permits almost no maneuver.  If you enjoy rolling for grand assaults, fine, if you enjoy maneuver ... forget it.

Historical, you bet.  Interesting to game, takes advantage of the GCACW system's strengths ... heck no.


Sheridan Rides South :star::star::star::nostar::nostar:
There's a lot to like here for those fans of cavalry actions, but somehow we just found it lacking.  In our latest session, the Union rolled amazingly well, the CSA quite poorly (think 10's and 11's for USA and 2's and 3's for the CSA).  The USA horsemen wailed on Fitz's boys, burned all but one station.  Marginal USA win.  It didn't feel like a marginal win, it felt like a landslide.  More importantly, it left us feeling rather blase.  I think the low number of CSA units (in effect three) kept the scenario from being interesting for the CSA player, while the dearth of real choices and superior numbers of the USA made it rather boring for them.  Calculating how best to move among stations so you can burn them most efficiently just wasn't very fun.  Perhaps if the CSA had rolled better and been able to uses their cavalry units to interdict the movement of the USA horsemen or if they'd been bolder with their infantry units things would have been more interesting.  Or perhaps they would have simply have lost more VPs.  We'll definitely give this scenario another chance someday, but not tomorrow.

Trevilian Station :star::star::star::star::nostar:
Or as we call it, "The Race to Little Rocky Creek" (N2932)
Ok, now this is a good cavalry scenario.  True, if Sheridan rolls really well for the first two turns and Hampton's crew rolls poorly, it might seem like a blow out is happening, but typically Hampton's boys get west of Sheridan's in the vicinity of Louisa Courthouse, and all hell breaks lose as Sheridan tries to burn stations and exit 4 or 5 brigades off the map.  He can be hard pressed to have a marginal win.  One of the keys to this scenario's success is simply the near partiy of units.  Not in strengths but in number.  The CSA has four and the USA five.  The USA's are stronger, but less likely to win initiative.

Love the series. This offers the most bloodshed but also, in the campaign game, the most variety I think. three or four genuinely different approaches to turn one for Grant, each branching off interestingly. Lee meanwhile has more options than it seems in the campaign game as well. Scenarios are very good - tough, brutal, and bloody. But again, as with all other games in the series I've played, the campaign came elevates it to another level.

Part of the Great Campaigns series of games, GTC provides many nail biting scenarios ranging from small engagements to multi week campaigns.  The rules are straight forward and rely on an initiative system, which results in a single turn requiring multiple decisions from each player, so down time is almost non-existant.  The game, as all in the series, captures the difference between the numericaly superior Union and the better lead and higher morale Confederate formations who benefit from superior leaders at all levels.  This forces players to use their armies historically and encourages the Confedrates to try daring maneuvers, which, if successful, could turn the course of an engagement, whilst the Union methodicaly advance, mass and overwhelm their weaker foes.  Units build fatigue as they move more and more and commanders have to continually decide between the advantages of securing geographic objectives and the disadvantages of wearing out their forces.  No decision is ever the best, you can only hope it is the least worse.  This will always remain one of my favourites.

Continues the fine tradition of the GCACW series. The Union have more troops but it's become easier for the Confederate defender to build entrenchments. Very challenging for both sides.

GCACW is an all-around excellent series, and this module sent it over the top.  This was the first game to include the standardized Basic Game rules (for all Basic Game scenarios across all modules - previously you had to reread/relearn the rules for every module you purchased).  The physical presentation is top-notch, and I much prefer the counter-art style of this game to the garish, crass, busy, somewhat cartoony art style of the later MMP modules.  I also much prefer the matte map and rulebooks to the current MMP approach of glossy maps and thin-paper glossy rulebooks (which, while the colors are vibrant, have all the durability of the latest issue of Newsweek or Playboy... in other words, are not at all durable compared to Grant Takes Command and earlier modules).  If I want to see nekkid chicks, I'll take the color vibrancy of Playboy (or the interwebs) ... but for wargames I'd much prefer the heavy matte stock of GTC.

There are an abundance of Basic Game scenarios (IIRC, there are 8 of them, possibly more - but not less).  Some long, some medium-length, some short.  Some use multiple maps, some use only one.  Some focus on set-piece battles, some deal with highly-mobile cav raiding.  All are well-balanced and get played regularly at tourneys.  Something for everyone.  The selection of scenarios is nothing short of excellent, including some of the system's all-time classics (such as Battle of the Wilderness and Race for Spotsylvania).

The historical notes alone are worth the price of admission, even if you never punch the counters.  This is, IMO, the pinnacle of the GCACW series.  It was incredibly good, and (due to MMP's switch to glossy maps/rules and cartoony counters) it will never be that good again.  If you have any interest at all in the GCACW system, trust me, GET THIS FUCKING MODULE if you can find it at a decent price.  While all of them are good, this one is a must-have, and the cream of the crop.  It will eventually command high prices on the secondary market without a doubt.

If you've never played GCACW before, this is the perfect place to start, due to the standardized basic rules (which you can use retroactively for any previous game in the series that you might later acquire, or any future entry, which also use and include the standard basic rulebook).

The Grognard's Dream. This is how pre-20th century wargames should be designed. I didn't give it a perfect 10 because the rules can be somewhat murky to newbies. In other words, I won't recommend trying to learn this system sole, I'd say have someone whose played it a few times explain it to you first. For example, in most games whatever happens to your units only changes them to a single new status. They may become say, disrupted or whatever it's called and that's it. In the Grant Takes Command system (GCACW - Great Campaigns of the American Civil War) a unit can be fatigued, or demoralized, or exhausted or disorganized, or any combinations of these states. And each state affects a different aspect of a unit's abilties and each can be caused by any number of different events. There are also extended marches and forced marches plus there are varying manpower strengths and combat strengths. There are also random movement allowances and activations to take into account. That's alot of states one unit can be in, but it all makes sense once you've played it a few times. It just takes a while for new players to get comfortable with the system. The upside is that once you master it there are 6 other excellent games in the series and plenty of scenarios to explore. All in all, it's a series that is well worth the time and effort you will put into it. If you are looking for a top-notch operational American Civil War system, you have found it.

The same as the rest of the GCACW series game.  I used to own all of them and for a while I loved the series.  But, I played them all so much, that I got burned out.

My first GCACW game and I am really thrilled with it.  The variety of scenarios is outstanding and the game leads to some very interesting maneuver.  I hvae still not played the campaign.  It also gives you a very good sense of why the Wilderness was the battle it was w/the difficulty of woods movement and stacking.  It accomplishes this without being terribly complex, as well.

My complaints about the series are two fold: counter stacks get very tall with 4 status counters and there is a lot of wristage, with rolls happening for a ton of things.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I really wanted to like this game, but I'm finding that given the density of the rules I cannot accept the fact that the fatigue and combat system make it impossible for the Battle of the Wilderness to ever mirror its historical counterpart. I think the trouble is that the system was developed for 1862 battles (Napoleonic), but the conversion to 1864 (proto-trench warfare) was not handled all that well. Given the fatigue rules and combat chart you'll rarely see short but bloody battles or either side throw up strong entrenchments in a day. I enjoyed [i]Lee vs. Grant[/i] more because it is easier to understand, takes up less table space, and in my opinion has better rules for leader activation. 

On the positive side of things it allows more interesting maneuvers than [i]Lee vs. Grant[/i] because you are dealing with more forces and a larger map. The random strategic events are an excellent touch and I like how Butler and Sigel are handled in the game.

I finally got to play this title and I really, really, really liked it.  I can't rate it higher cuz the rules and counter maintenance are a bit obtuse for some.  On the plus side, it's a terrific tactical Civ War game.  The maps are beautiful, and I love the counters with the generals on them.  There's a LOT to keep track of, but I found the choices engrossing and the gameplay satisfying.  The game is a bit slow, and the bigger scenarios will take a LONG time.  I hope to get more play in soon on this system.

Probably the best pre-20th century operational system. The system is extremely chaotic (everything from movement to combat to just being able to attack is subject to a die roll), but in the long run the best strategy and tactics should prevail.

The campaign should ideally be played with the maps from On to Richmond, so as to show Butler's operations around Drewry's Bluff and Petersburg. The Valley maps don't add much.

I am a GCACW fan, was a little disappointed in GTC.  My reasons are game play and artwork.

I focus on the campaign games, in GTC only among all the games of the series there is a tendency for the game to end up with long lines of counters stretching across most of the map.

Artwork, I should say the map.  The counters are probably the best of the series (counters in games since GTC are easily the worst).  But the Rick Barber map is bad.

Maybe "bad" is to strong a word.  But when a long series consists of maps that are excellent in interrupted by the pedestrian work handed in by the artist in this case, well it just stands out like a sore thumb.

A great game for the best operational level treatment of the ACW to date. An impressive assortment of basic scenarios and multiple advanced scenarios pack a lot of gaming greatness into one package. Slightly lower production values [flimsy/thin counters and a different color scheme on the maps than the other six games in the GCACW series] than On to Richmond keep me from rating this game a "9" but all-and-all it is every bit as good in content and value as OTR [which is my personal favorite] and a welcome addition to this great system.

I love all in the GCACW Series. One knock I hear about these series of games is that the Union player has a very slim chance to win. In my opinion this one along with "On to Richmond", gives the Union player the best chance to come out victorious. Grant has superior numbers and knows how to use them better than McClellan, Pope and a string of other Union generals featured in GCACW. Watch the Union and Confederates slam into each other relentlessly and see who wears down first. I am amazed how well the game simulates the actual campaign and how a good Union general can cause the Confederates to slowly lose their edge due to attrition and the fatigue of constant fighting. No fear for the Union player here like in the other games. Move by the left flank!

Lots of short scenarios that can be played in a night, unlike other GCACW series.

The GCACW series has more dice rolling than any other game I've ever played, even Axis & Allies and Queen's Gambit. The series is a great simulation and recreates what the commanding generals went though  during the civil war. 

There have been too many times were one or more of the following have happened in a game; one side wins 10 or more initiatives in a row, consistantly rolling 1 or 2 for movement, fail every extended march roll, roll a 5 on command during an assault, roll 6 when conducting a grand assault. The list goes on and doesn't make for a pleasant game.

I have some house rules to help limit the heavy luck element in this series and make it more enjoyable.

Though I've only tried 1 scenario (Battle for the Wilderness), the game clearly offers a wider breadth of scenarios than its predecessors (except for, perhaps, the ludicrously expensive On To Richmond).  Additionally, what with the standard rules having been finalized prior to this game's release, it's definitely the most evolved.  A friend of mine recently commented how refreshingly clear and comprehensible he found the rules to be.  I told him they had better be clear after 7 iterations!  For the record, I haven't yet ventured into the campaign games of any in the series, so I can make no comments on GTC's save that I've heard it's good.  So, if you're looking for a place to start with GCACW, it appears to be right here.

RATING: 7
I grew up on Star Fleet Battles, but I think this is a HUGE improvement.  Ditching the 32-impulse chart and allowing on-the-fly energy allocation was pure genius.  The components are gorgeous and game play is streamlined and faster.

Actually Romulan Space, which is the cheaper option to get to go along with Klingon Border, but there's no BGG entry for this yet (might have to make one [maybe just a version of this]). This means no boards and no full rulebook (just supplement with extra rules and ship descriptions). I have the rulebook from Academy but am quite board poor.
EDIT: actually it did come with a single map panel (not listed in contents), but looks like a reject (print/cut a little off) and included to help the pack resist bending. Still, useable enough.

Here's Marco Arnaudo getting excited about it:
https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/65612/item/3817887#item3817887
There's a summary/review, a product range explanation and a playthrough in separate videos.

UPDATE: I have largely fixed my board poverty with the acquisition of [thing=229134][/thing] (what a nuisance it's designated an RPG item and can only be cross-referenced rather than added here as it's own entry). Not perfect but serviceable enough with hex sizes matching the large FC size, allowing FC panels to be used as overlays.

This is actually Romulan Space the Romulan add-on for Klingon Border.  Romulan ships are interesting and I think as I play more I'll learn how to use them effectively.

RATING: 8
Add a bit more complexity with plasma (why are there so many types of plasma, was that really needed?)

Still, a cool game, but start with the Klingon's they are simpler to learn.

This is the same game as [gameid=19854] (same rulebook) with different ships and counters. It is not an expansion, since it has the full maps and rulebook also, and can be played by itself.  

Rating and further comments are at [gameid=19854].

RATING: 7
Played once.  A good game if you're looking for Star Trek style combat -- much more digestible that Star Fleet Battles, although there's still a pretty serious learning curve.  Invest the time to play a couple of times and judge it from there.

RATING: 2
You know why.  Expensive expansion that was not needed in any way.  Inferior components compared to other titles in its price range.  Hell, an enthusiastic player made better cloak and plasma counters than ADB did for its own bloody game. Save your money and buy Star Trek: Legacy for PC and XBox.  It will not only cost you less (50 bucks for Legacy) but you will get a real 3D environment.  How ADB can justify its pricing of these titles in the era of computer games is beyond me.

I actually own the Romulan Space expansion to the Klingon Border base game, rather than the Romulan Border base game, but it's supposed to include everything from the latter that wasn't in the former.

Take the good parts of  Star Fleet Battles  (detail-oriented simulation of  Star Trek: the Original Series  space combat with emphasis on authenticity, high functionality and consistency; starships that can do anything...or almost anything...their TV counterparts can) and mix in modern-day gaming sensiblities (clear, easy-to-learn game mechanics; multi-layered, decision-oriented gameplay; super-high production values) and you have the game that is sure to become ADB's flagship game for the 21st century.  Besides introducing the Romulans and the Gorn to FedCom (try playing the USS Enterprise vs. the Romulan War Eagle battle from the first season/Remastered series debut episode "Balance of Terror"), Romulan Border features new Federation ships, including the SFU version of the USS Reliant, the New Light Cruiser, eliminating ship overlap.

A great, lighter version, of Star Fleet Battles akin to the ASL starter kits.  The game is streamlined and quickened, while sacrificing little from it's bigger brother.  The components are nice as the set includes a sturdy board which accomidates small or mega-hex counters, included with the game.  The laminated SSDs are a welcome design.

RATING: 7.5
This title is a easier to play stripped down Starfleet Battles. I really like this system they removed all the complex rules and stream lined the game. This will clearly be the end of old school Starfleet Battles.

Look out, here come the Romulans.  

With an updated rulebook, Romulans, Gorns, and some more Feds; this game can either stand alone, or make a MEGA expansion for the Klingon Border title.

I opted to purchase this over Romulan Space because I wanted the extra charts, another dry erase pen, and the extra map panels.

If they could combine all things in Star Fleet Battles series altogether like ASL...I would grab a copy of this! Now...Romulan is my favourite race in Star Fleet universe.  Highest ranking in the wargame rating in the SFB series.

I am not too bothered by the lack of 3D in space ship combat.  Imagination is the name of this game and series.  In fact, it looks to me that the weapon rules factor in the 3D "concerns" already without specific "range" or "direction" limitation on each type of weapon in terms of height, implying that they can all fire up or down towards the targets. One of the beauty for this system. As Stephen pointed out above, SFB is actually a naval game in space, not jet fight as in WWII where height in sky is relevant, such as in the game [thing=3608][/thing].  

I am reading the [thing=21373][/thing] rulebook now as a comeback to the Star Fleet Universe.  It is a more streamlined version in terms of movement, no more secret plotting, and of combat, a single dieroll to determine the table for use with damage allocation instead of dozens of dierolls to determine damage location individually.  Well, the scale has been up in FC as squadron and so the granularity can be increased.

The problem I have with the base game is that they always contain bare-bone scenarios only.  You always have to invest in the more carefully designed scenarios which render more meaningful narrative and story-telling.

My favorite wargame. Very pretty cards, good miniatures, excellent support from the designer, very refined ruleset. A must-have if you like wargaming and Star Trek. Considerably easier than Star Fleet Battles (made by the same designer).

I actually own "Romulan Space," which is the expansion to buy if you already own Klingon Border and want the rules, counters, and ship cards to get the stuff from Romulan Border, too.

In general I like Fed Com, as it strips away some of the ridiculous rules from Star Fleet Battles and makes the game play faster (and easier for math challenged people like me).  That being said, I still love me some SFB too.

LONG time admirer (from afar) of Star Fleet Battles, but because of that game's complexity, I never took the plunge.  Federation Commander is EXACTLY the game (in the Star Fleet Universe) that I've wanted since I was 10 (when SFB was released).  Easy-to-understand rules, terrific game play (this game is just dang fun) and it all looks great to boot.  Of course now I'm addicted to the minis and that's another reason I'm so pleased with the game!  I hadn't painted a miniature in well over 10 years and now I'm painting ships for FC almost every day!  Thank you Amarillo Design Bureau!

I've been a fan of SFB (Star Fleet Battles) for a long time, although rarely get the chance to play.  FC is an improvement in my mind, as the simplifications all speed up the game without damaging the mechanic.  However, the long game time has ultimately put me off this sort of game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Quite a nice game. Worthy of a few plays, but more valuable to me as an intro to SFB or a 'SFB-lite' game which can be played by non-die hard players.

FC: Romulan Border adds the Plasma Torpedo using Romulan Star Empire and Gorn Confederacy to the Fed Comm universe. With the addition of these weapons and the Romulan Cloaking Device - all of the races from Star Trek: The original Series are now present in the Federation Commander game.

I like the Fed Com game and it's not that hard to learn and I love the theme.  But the game does seem kind of dry and I'm not a big fan of the 'All ships in a big arena' battle every man for himself type scenario.  It think this is much better as an admiral my fleet mission based game, but I haven't gotten to play those all that much.

Plays very similar to 80s games like Battletech and Car Wars.  While there are tons of ships, I would have appreciated a wider variety of weapons and defenses.  Turns into a slug fest.

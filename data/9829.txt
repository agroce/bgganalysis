RATING: 4
This game would have been good 30 years ago but today it is just so dated. High on theme but although the multitude of cards provide variety they don't prevent it from becoming very repetitive - and way too long for this level of game (and that's not to mention the downtime). Don't play this with six - you have been warned. I find it difficult to believe that Martin Wallace's name is on the box.

Played with house rules to speed up the game (scaling xp requirements for advancements, separate ally and item decks, road spaces can be moved onto like towns, etc.).

I sort of like it; it sort of has a SNES RPG type feel, how you go from place to place beating bad guys that are about your level and getting more powerful. It has a big problem with pacing, though. It is very easy to afford some really good magic items, while taking a relatively long time to improve your stats. And I don't really like the movement dice, even though I think they are interesting. They really slow the game down.

RATING: 6.5
I got this mainly for research - and my fondest of all things Talisman. After half dozen plays, it isn't as exciting for me and I don't play it any more - but I really do like the theme. Although the movement dice are really far too complex for what they do, the biggest strike is the length of play. It also suffers from a problem often found in fantasy board games: once you explore all its crazy cards and encounters, the jig is up, the surprises are all opened, and all that's left is cleaning up after the party. There's no fun left to be had.

Second edition is an improvement and I would especially recommend the character decks. They make the game much more interesting. I've never played the replacement boards, but I imagine that would help tremendously.

The 1st edition was not a fun game. Character cards are highly imbalanced. Going first is a big advantage. Some artifacts / followers are too powerful. Player vs player combat makes the game less fun. A variable map would make it more interesting. Events would be better if you got more than three in a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Roll die to move adventure is really strange.....you can't go where you want.....you go where the dice lets you.

Encounters are similarly dealt to you, 'solve' it by luck of dice rolls.....

Simple, beautiful, light. Nothing to shout about though.

RATING: 3
I originally rated it as a 7. However after FFG decided to release a second edition, I rate it now as a 3. I bought this game in hindsight to buy the add-ons but they are all incompatible with the first edition which is a rip-off to customers. A second edition release within one year, what a joke. I am refraining from buying the second edition now. I am very disappointed!!!

That's why I sold it via Ebay recently.

Very disappointing. All the theme is there as well as great artwork, decent storyline and lots of flexibility, but it still boils down to huge amounts of die rolling...or watching someone else roll dice. The sheer lack of player interactivity is a problem. This game could have been sooooo much more.

Runebound is a good, but a bit slow played substitute for talisman.I like it, when there are 4 or less players, othervise the turns are to slow. Good fun entertainment for the casual adventure player.

RATING: 5
I think Fantasy Flight did very well with this game, component-wise.  The board, counters and artwork are all excellent.  Sadly, the gameplay just isn't there.  I would rather play Talisman if I'm looking for a fantasy character-building game.  This game is very luck-based (from the die-rolling in encounters to the items and allies that show up for purchase) and the encounters are generally repetitive.

I had some really bad luck playing which meant I had no chance catching up to the others, the game is so damn luck based. The move dice are terrible, it's a bad system, period. The worst part of the game is the amount of dead time, there's nothing to do while waiting for your turn, and the game seems to take for ever. You also end up with way too many cards after a while. If you have bad luck you won't get any henchmen to help you in battles and the game becomes impossible.

This one's pretty good, as long as you're not playing with too many people, and you're using the rules they provide to speed up the game by gaining experience faster.

The movement dice have a tendency to annoy me, too.

The second edition has improved greatly over the first edition (by leaps and bounds in several places).  I can't imagine playing the game without the extra variant rules (included officially with the base game now, and offered on the website previously when the 1st edition was available) for random encounters on the road between adventure counters, and for the doom track.  I also added in all the current small expansions that aren't new adventures, and these have added a lot of adventure variety.  (I added the expansions straightaway, since variety is the lifeblood of many an adventure game anyways, Runebound no exception.)

The market stack is now very huge, but there is a good spread of interesting items, and the items are more balanced.  You can now increase your experience in not just mind/magic/combat (which you now increase by 2 levels per counter), but also your exhaustion (2 per counter) and your life (1 per counter).  The adventures are much more challenging now; charging into the game and directly into yellow counters is a sure-fire way of spending the next few turns licking your wounds in town.  There are a lot more green adventures I would run away from, too, without at least a cheap ally and/or armor.  And fortunately, getting knocked out does leave you with your hard-earned experience points, though all your gold and your best item go away.  And nowadays, I wouldn't call Lord Margath "Margaret" without making sure he didn't hear me.

I look forwards to soon trying the adventure variants (the two small and the one big, currently) and class decks.  I most eagerly look forwards to the new slew of small expansions (hopefully more in the realm of adventure cards than market cards---the market deck is frighteningly huge right now, and I need to pare it down myself) and the big Arabian Nights-style expansion.  Fortunately, nowadays hunting Lord Margy is enough even for me.

For what it is, a light, immersive adventure game, it's good. Too much downtime, way too much luck and terrible rules make this impossible to play as as serious game. I'll play again if it hits the table, but never with more than 3 players (unless I have a second game going between my turns) and never with anybody who takes it too seriously, and only without the silly, stupid movement dice....

A worthy successor to Talisman, and if you are older than thirty and remember Talisman then there is little reward in going to this. For those who have never played Talisman then you are probably better off getting this, for the availability and expansions, if nothing else.

Having bought this edition as it shipped, and having FFG reissued it without any refund (that I knew of since i live in Italy), this game is just a big disappointment. Rather than reshipping the game they should have made at least an upgrade available to the unlucky customers that trusted them at launch.

In the end, a flawed game that I wont buy again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
In spite of the beautiful components and a few interesting game mechanics, gameplay is a frustrating morass of random movement, unbalanced encounters within a color-level, miss-priced items for sale at cities, and worst of all... even with only three players, there is an irritating downtime. House rules are necessary for me to enjoy this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Ulgh!  Luck-heavy.  Dicefest.  I agree that it's a race game hiding behind a fantasy, character-development theme.  Game is fairly repetitive with low amounts of player interaction... and one lucky bugger will get the good rolls at the right time to win.

This looked like something I might like and Martin Wallace's name on it didn't hurt. Shame on me for not having done more homework. What's worse is I bought the first edition which is now a total dead end. Fantasy Flight sure screwed up on this one - but the upside is that I learned my lesson having only bought the base game and saved myself a ton by staying a barge-pole's length away from the 2nd edition and subsequent expansions.

The first play or two was sort of interesting - a couple interesting twists on roll and move in the movement dice and an interesting character development approach, plus some cool stuff in the cards. But, a fixed board, scripted play dynamics with more chaos than I'm comfortable with and an unsatisfying end-game made this game old very fast.

I put this in roughly the same category now as Talisman and that's not good...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The game is along the same track as Talisman.  The combat system is kind of dull and the game is pretty much pure luck.  The skill level is extremly low.  There is nothing that stands out as fundamentally wrong with it, so I must just say its not my cup of tea.

This is a lot of fun. It has so many possiblities I can hardly wait to buy the expansions. The one problem with this game is the first player has a great advantage at the beginning of the game. The first player will get to the nearest city and earn gold to spend there.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
The best elements of Talisman, D&D, and Magic all combined into the first game system that can be called a worthy successor to Talisman.  With a few rules tweaks and with the forthcoming expansions this will be a 10 in no time, and over time will become a classic.  If you like Talisman and RPGs, buy this NOW!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
There are a lot of things that bothered me in this game: the disadvantage of going late in the first round; the lack of easy encounters in the late game; too much luck in combat; unbalanced equipment and companions; and a roll-and-move mechanic, which is nice thematically and usually works quite well, but it's still roll-and-move and can be really annoying if you're rolling no suitable terrain.

The game takes quite long, and there is no player interaction, except for attacking each other directly, which never happened in our games so far.

While I liked the feel of the game, all these issues reduce the fun of adventuring for me. Towards the end, some always have extremely powerful items, which let them, for example, fly over the map, or defeat most encounters without effort. Meanwhile, other players are too far behind to catch up, and don't even have any easy-enough encounters left in reach so they cannot even fight for the fun of it.

Apparently a lot has been fixed/improved in the 2nd edition: players start in the middle of the map, encounters refresh, and 2d10 replace the d20 to reduce variance in encounters. I guess the new edition could be much more enjoyable.

Runebound has been collecting dust on my shelve for the last six months.The first few times I played it was fun,but after awhile it became stale,boring, and repetitive. The downtime between players is significant and once there is a clear winner everyone just waits around for him to win and finish the game.

The gist of the game is defeating monsters to get gold to buy artifacts/allies at the towns & not taking on too big of a challenge before you've leveled up enough.  This game can really bog down.  There is no reason the next player cannot do their movement roll & have everything planned out, except for looking at the Challenge card.  I'd go crazy playing this game with AP sloths.

Absolutely fails to scale properly to 5 or 6 players.  Between the excessive downtime between turns, and the "nothing left for the last player" syndrome (player moving last is extremely vulnerable to being shut out of attainable encounters locally and must move on -- repeat this for four or five consecutive turns), the fun factor in this game is non-existent.  A nice try, a good effort, but much better for three or four.

RATING: 5
This is a good pseud-RPG, but the second edition of the game fixes some problems in the first.  Such as rate of advancement, timing of events, probability distributions.  So, there really isn't any reason to own this one, unless you pick it up on the cheap.  Wouldn't recommend playing with more than four.

RATING: 3
Owned it, played it, traded it away. This game makes me ashamed to be a gamer (both Board game player and RPG). Poorly designed, and while colorful and with great pieces, it doesn't occupy the time or have any real excitement to it. Added to the fact that the way FFG handled it seemed as if they used Version 1 for playtesting (with the general public's responses) and version 2 which fixed some of the major glitches but required gamers to purchase the game all over again makes me angry with their system. (Which is really disappointing, considering I like a lot of other FFG games).

Ehh...yes and no, love and hate...the main problem is that this takes "multiplayer solitaire" to a whole new level...it's entirely possible to play simultaneously so long as each player is far enough away from each other.  It's a very good Talisman-style game with some good touches but it definitely needs expansion and a harder difficulty level.   The "Shadows Over Margath" cards add miniscule amount of interaction but it feels like a stopgap for a larger expansion.

This is a pretty good game. One of the few games available that really feels like a quest game. Having said this, it really isn't that interactive with the other players unless you are playing with 3 or preferable 4 players. Otherwise you are taking turns playing the game by yourself. I look forward to the expansions adding some depth. There feels like something is missing from the base game that keeps it from really being good. I am hoping the second edition with deal with some of this as well. hehe, and better miniatures, etc. always help.  Still an enjoyable game for what it is.

Bought it and sold it. It's nothing like a "German" game as I was expecting. I wish the story/quest elements shone through a bit more. There's no "go there to do that" stuff, except for buying new allies/items, but nothing quest related (like Dungeoneer has). I like the combat system. Don't play w/ more than 4. Granted, mine was the first edition, and played prior to the essential faq/errata. I kinda wish I would have tried the 2nd edition, but for now I'm happy with Prophesy.

The comparisons to Talisman are a little off. While superficially the same game the movement mechanics are completely different, the combat system is more complicated and the rules are laid out just awfully. I'm curious about how different the 2nd edition is and whether its worth picking up. We tried playing with six players for our inaugral game and it was just too many. Too much of a wait between turns, too many people to argue about or get bored by the rules.

Having said that it has th potential for fun and I think a smaller group may be a better way to play.

There is a lot of good stuff hiding somewhere in this game, but it is clearly broken. Some items are far too powerfull compared to their price, some should have been left out entirely. And some allies are actually more powerfull than your heroes!!! You will need the advanced rules from the website and a handfull of houserules to make it at least decent. What a shame...

Ok, I'm a old-school, dedicated Dungeons and Dragons player. Blush.  So, I'm suprised I didn't really enjoy Runebound.  Improving heros with skills and magic items and beating up mythological beasties should be my bread and butter, but I was just....bored.  Maybe the second edition is better?

RATING: 6.5
Pretty fun with 3-4 players - makes for a good game. However, there are serious luck issues - it makes or breaks you. Hoping that the expansions really address this (and makes quests more important and worth following). Playing with more than 4 adds way too much downtime.

Interesting story line and tons of room for expansions and homebrew campaigns. 

I am interested in trialling the newer version, along with some added expansions to update &  compare my experience 1st edition. I think with the right # of players, this can be a fantastic exploration/adventure game.

Tons of dice rolling, the movement mechanism that is innovative but doesn't work well, too many cards to keep track of, the first player has an advantage, there's a runaway leader problem, and last but not least, the game has a ridiculous amount of downtime.  Good for the RPG set perhaps, German gamers should be wary.

The game mechanics are similar to Arkham Horror. The event mechanic is cool where you cannot have multiple bad events happening to you. The game was fun. Although, it took us more than 4 hours to complete our first 2-player game.

RATING: 6
Fun for the first time, but the fun doesn't last.  Players quickly become almost invincible and inordinately powerful cards abound.  Don't play with less than 6 players or player interaction becomes minimal (although the game then lasts too long).  Plus, there is only 1 scenario that can only end 1 of 2 ways.  Play a friend's copy.

This game presses the same buttons that Magic The Gathering did for me in the past , and I really enjoyed it when it was my turn.  That said, the publisher should never have said that this game plays with more than 4.  There is a huge downtime problem with increasing number of players (we had 5).  With 3 I think you'd have a sweet spot but 4 is probably tolerable.  You could play this solitaire too if you wanted, most likely, because in a way it really is multi-player solitaire.  The tactics are in utilizing your allies and objects to beat the baddies and really the only interaction with other players is competing for the quests and to get the best items from a city's market.
ETA - I would rate this an 8 for the first 2 hrs.  Then it just goes too long.

with 2 players it keeps 2 hours. with 4 players it goes to 3,5 hours and with 6 players to 5 hours. It is full of math tests. at the end your head is going to blow up. and thw worse is that every player have to wait for 10 to 15 minutes before he has hiw turn. I have played with many people and nobody wants to play it a second time.

Meh, I don't know. Sort of D&D meets Magic: The Gathering turned into a board game. It's alright. The game is simple and it's got decent flavor.

RATING: 5
(1st edition) Players each take a hero character, throw some terrain dice, and move across a hexmap land, interacting with adventure spaces, towns and other players.  Movement is a bit cumbersome (you can only enter hexes that match terrain types you throw), as is combat (I'm already throwing 3D20 for ranged/melee/magic together to save time), but the theme and RPG feel really shine through via excellent components and a strong narrative sense in the adventure cards.  This one sees the heros trying to do in a dragon horde, and it will be simplicity itself to release a new deck of cards for a new adventure.  There does seem to be a lot of cash floating around in the game, and once you have an ally or two, the challenges are very easy to defeat.  Perhaps with more players the temptation to push your luck will force a blunder or two.  After a few games this one decayed away - just too easy, too samey, too dull.  Update: And lo! out comes a second edition with several fixes - too late, my horse bolted.

RATING: 7
One of the best games of the "Talisman" genre. Can be unbalenced on certain occasions but that is quite usual for this kind of game. The 2nd. Edition Reissue Thing sucked, hopefully FFG learns from it.
UPDATE 9-->7 with the release of the 2.nd edition all the flaws of the first version became obvious. There should have been more test playing.

RATING: 6
This is the only RPG type board game I own, and for that reason, I like it a lot, even if it takes too long.  Only problem I see right now is that armies of allies are too strong... if that's balanced out, the game will be really great (besides the taking too long)

Received Runebound 1st edition in a math trade. Played a few times the 2nd edition before getting 1st edition.

Figured I'll try out the 1st edition with my brother to see if its worth investing for the 2nd edition since a know a few people who has the 2nd ediion of Runebound.

*UPDATE*
My brother`s girlfriend doesn`t like the theme. Don`t think I`ll get them to play. So I won`t get the 2nd edition. I know a few people who has the 2nd edition. If I want to play the 2nd edition, I will play with them.

Fun, but some items totally throw the game balance out of wack (like Touch of Death). I know there are lots of 'house rules' out there to fix things, but I like to play games out of the box.

I've played it now with players from 5 to 2, and I have to say it's my current favorite.  5 players was too much downtime.  3 seems optimal.

After two games, I'd have to say that this is a pretty decent version of Talisman. Of course, there is the problem of waiting for your turn which takes forever. ANd the only player interaction is pouncing on your fellow players when they're down and stealing the only thing they had going for them... But that can be fun if you're brother's being a dick.

[Adventure, Dice-rolling, Fantasy, Definitely NOT an RPG] Once again, we have a beautifully produced game (which is becoming standard for FFG these days) wasted by weak design and development. To everyone who says that this is a substitute for a REAL role-playing game - sorry, not even in the same universe. It's a seriously flawed, boring game. Martin Wallace gave it the old college try, but Runebound falls flat on its face. It's not even a good Eurogame. It is clearly the weakest of all of his efforts. So, you have a game that's a poor Euro, and it's awful as a RPG substitute. Translation: Eurogame lovers AND RPG lovers should pass on Runebound. *** UPDATE: Not touching this one ever again if I can help it. Unbelievably slow, more downtime than a monster wargame, no story, no strategy, no tactics, horrendously boring. This is a borderline "2" - I'll play Settlers with all expansions before I even consider Runebound again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I played it 3-4 times, its a nice game, you have to play with the advanced rules no question about it.
The first match we were very careful not to die....this is a mistake, you can try yellow mission very soon dont worry about dying.
Another suggestion....get one or more allies as soon as possible they can help you really alot.
Even  red card are not so powerful...with 4 experience counter a couple of allies and a good item you can beat them and if you kill just one of them with the power of the dragon rune u can kill nearly all monster fron the other missions.
Played this way the game is fast and funny.
Believe me

Highly overrated. Built around a unique but pointless movement mechanic that propels players (too slowly) through a world stocked with dull, voluntary challenges and practically no player interaction.

The only original thing about this game is the fighting mechanism, and it only gets interesting when you have a couple of allies in your party. The movement mechanism is no big deal. With 4 players, you wait a long time between moves. Player vs player combats are rare, so interaction is low.

Runebound is not a particularly deep game. Much depends on random card draws and dice rolls, equipment cards can be somewhat unbalanced, and even the winning conditions are fairly arbitrary. But at least if played quickly, it's still an entertaining romp through a (somewhat nondescript) fantasy realm.

Solid "8".  Fun experience, lots of great things going on.  Truly an SNES-style RPG in boardgame form, except now you can compete against another player.

It doesn't scale past three, even though it would imply you could play this with six (DON'T!).  So it's not an "every gamenight" type deal.  Still, it's quite enjoyable for what it is. 

If you think you'll like a game of this type and don't mind a fair share of randomness, then this is very likely the game for you.

Based on how good this game can be with fewer players when everyone is getting along fine, it deserves a 9. Based on how bad it can be when played with too many and someone gets behind without any chance to recover, it deserves a 5. Huge dicefest, which I guess is OK for an RPG-like boardgame.

This is the boardgame if you do not have all day to play an RPG and need your D&D fix.

I didn't think it could get better!  However, if you want to play the expansions, you need the second edition.  But the first edition is fine on its own.

Picked this up for cheap not knowing what it was.  I didn't like it all because not only did it take 4 hours with 2 players, but it consisted of dice rolls for everything (Dice roll to move, dice roll to fight, dice roll to check).  The biggest downfall is that this is the first edition, and is out of print as well as the expansion, so I am pretty much doomed to the ONE adventure over and over.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Components are fairly shoddy - I don't know what others see in it but everything looks computer-generated to me; heroes are cardboard pieces rather than miniatures; only 6 plastic hero stands (there are 12 characters so you need to swap which is lame); the board feels cramped; marketplace icons are difficult to distinguish; the rune image printed on chits are too small (we replaced them with glass stones - BIG improvement to visibility of encounters). Still, the game is suprisingly entertaining, the movement dice mechanic is interesting, combat is fun if simple, and my partner enjoys the game so it actually gets played - thus the decent rating.

After 20 or so plays the game is repetitive and suffers from downtime. Consequently I've lowered my score and sold the game.

A year since writing the above I find myself interested in RB again.. 2nd edition is on it's way for Christmas (2006). Perhaps I'll play it again and sell it again? Let's see.. :)

The leading players can even attack the weaker ones, furthering their lead.

A very good game, though I think it needs a few house rules to make it so. Luckily, it is very open for adaptation. My favorite aspect of the game is the global event cards and side quest cards that give you more to do than just slay monsters. However, slaying the monsters is also quite fun if you're into dice rolling. Trying to gather the best items and allies to complement your hero also adds to the experience. You may want to limit the number you can have or discard a few, however. This game has lots of luck, but some strategy too, and you can balance these out (or unbalance them) as much as you want with your house rules. The one thing I would have liked to see is a modular board to make the experience even more different everytime.

A fantasy adventure game for boardgamers who don't usually play RPG's and for role-players who don't usually play boardgames.  Simple mechanics and some innovative touches as well (the terrain dice for movement) make the experience "feel" right.  

And for Talisman detractors and fans: this one's got better gameplay and balance, with an equal amount of roaming and sandboxing and chaos, but less interesting worldbuilding and chrome. [I may be biased because TALISMAN was my golden-age game in grade school, so I love the characters and artwork that is all Warhammer-based].  

It's a dungeon crawl - pick a character, roam the countryside, kill stuff, get gold, build up your stats, buy more cool stuff, repeat. Well-designed to incorporate its expansions. 

Although it says you can play with six, I think four is the maximum number of players to avoid horrific downtimes.

It's an interesting game, which can also be played solo.  I really liked the movement dice idea, with multiple icons per side, allowing you to enter one area per dice with the appropriate terrain icon.

The game itself is fairly straightforward, although the game's time clock (monsters killed) really forces you to forge ahead.  If you waste any time, you will not survive the final battle!

Oh yeah, there are a gazillion expansions for it, from new adventures to new monsters, to new items and treasures.

amazing RPG! Characters are chasing after Lord Morgath. The first edition does have run away leader problems. I didn't know that for a long time. I thought I was just good. The second edition fixed many problems this game has.

This is a great game!! It takes D&D and simplifes it so non-D&D people can play it, it also is a great intoro to D&D and you can realy build onto each of your characters and aloso having allies is very nice too also the many different items are very good to  have to me this game is great

The second edition is far better than the  first and fixes numerous difficulties, plus it's much more challenging. Nice blend of fantasy-RPG-feel and boardgame aesthetics. Perhaps a bit too long, unless using the rules for a short game as well as the Doom Track.

Much better when using the errata'd rules that balance the game's biggest offenders. Still, I wish it had more interaction and a leader punishing mechanism.

Streamlined Talisman type RPG.  It's a fun game but has strong solitaire feel due to lack of competitive and/or cooperative aspects.  WoW is a much better game.

RATING: 10
Feels like all the best parts of a complete role-playing campaign in a single evening, where half the fun is telling the stories of the combats and circumstances surrounding the encounters.

Be warned, though—downtime is a SERIOUS problem—I would NEVER want to play this with more than three.

My son and I are enjoying the hell out of this one—a great way to spend a lazy Saturday afternoon.  Rootbeer & pretzels, anyone?

RATING: 7
I played (and own) Runebound 2.ed.
A lot of the complaints I've heard from people about the game were not evident when I played, so perhaps they were corrected!?
I does a nice job of giving you an epic adventure during an evenings play.
My main complaint would be the time it takes, but luckily that is easily fixed (with one of the optional rules in the game).
So despite many of my customer bashing this game, I'll stand by it for now (and though I can see the similarities with Talisman - I think comparing the two is a bit unfair). Runebound offers a lot of tacticals choices along the way, while Talisman gives you nearly none. There are dice involved, so if you hate that, don't play this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good Talisman-like game, superior in many ways but does have flaws.  Interaction is low, and some items are fatally broken.  Would rate higher if house rules and removal of some items were not required.  2nd Edition will probably fix these things.

This is a good game, but I can see where the problems in the game are...  Mostly in the fact that there are large areas of the board that can be cleared and someone in the area can be left there doing nothing...  2/25/07
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A quest game that is better than Talisman.  Great components and theme, but the game suffers from two problems: *severe* downtime between turns and some items are very overpowered to the point of being unbalanced.  Players that fall behind stay behind, as their opponents gobble up the encounter spaces like candy.  Do not play with more than four players, as the downtime becomes unbearable.  A fun game for three.  (This comment is for the first edition of the game.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I like the mechanics, but with 6 there's too much downtime and the game takes to long.  We ended up quitting midway through.

RATING: 4
A quite neat fantasy adventure game. Very flavorful. The movement-dice thing is rather odd but everything else fits quite well. On the other hand, it's basically solitaire, and I could see it getting stale after four or five plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.2
I didn't expect that much when I traded for this game(1st ed.), but I'm a sucker for dungeon crawls and I like a lot of Wallace's work, so I had to try it. This is really an enjoyable game that is simple to learn and has a lot of theme. Expansions will be needed to increase the replay value, but it's still a great (and much shorter) alternative to Magic Realm and Talisman.

The outcome often depends on who can find the boss first, and this is more or less random. But it is nevertheless a great game in the Talisman tradition. We have played out the main game. I am looking forward to the expansions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The variant I played seemed to be impossible to win as the player's side at first, but in the end we did win suprisingly. However, the game seemed to have flaws. For most of the game the good side has no interaction between players at all and the game is sort of 4 player solitaire. In addition, there really aren't that many strategic choices. It pretty much boils down to a luck fest.

Quite fun, but can take a very long time to finish a game.

RATING: 6.5
Well, I always thought this was somehow a nice game. Simple rules, great fun, multiplaying, and no DM-ing (like HeroQuest... I always had to be the DM) I could be a player, cool.

However, there was unbalance... so what. The game was fun anyways.

However, there was... one scenario, but the game always have some strange turns of events that makes everything different. A new cast of players makes all the difference.

However... we felt there was only one main strategy, and we also felt the PvP was somehow lacking. We then made an house rule for the PvP that corrected half of the problem. But we thought and thought, and created a new game from it.

Well, Runebound has its weak points, but the game is general was so fun that it compensated. For the rest, I only used my head a little bit and I created a "better" game in my opinion. Meandor is now getting great. My friends and I are having good fun, but I still gotta be the DM, dammit (because my game is a strange mix of the versatile aspects from heroquest and the battle system from runebound). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is very Talisman like.  The pluses: fixed many Talisman annoyances: game length, random deaths, linearity.  The minuses:  still hard to catch the leader.  I'll play it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good light RPG/Adventure style game.  I don't think I'd play with more than four people - too much downtime between turns.  Let the next player roll the terrain dice and determine movement while the active player finishes his turn - this speeds up the game considerably.

If you liked Talisman, good. If you ran screaming from it, you might look elsewhere.

Run around, kill stuff. d20-based, so there can be a range of conclusions from your skill checks and attack rolls.

RATING: 7
A board game version of D&D that provides fresh new ideas and mechanics. It's expandable, inexpensive and easily understood. I made an intermediate variant that's not quite as tough as Runebound Advanced that we are enjoying.
The best thing is that Martin Wallace designed 50% of this game.

I really wanted to like this, but haven't been able to get into it.  Not enough player interaction for my taste - maybe future expansions will fix this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Our first game with only 2 players took at least 5 hours which is way too long for my taste. Then we played with altered rules so that one only needed 3 XP to gain level. That took 3-4 hours although we where 4 players (two of them were children and new to the game). In time we will probably be able to play it in 2 hours ... that's ok.

I like the battles, the movement dices are ok ... sometimes you get stuck, but usually only for one round. During the two games we have played so far, if you fell behind you weren't able to catch up.

The second game I got to play with Bogran the Shadow. He turned out to be slightly overpowered, since none of the green encounters were any danger. Next time maybe if he can't deal more than 1 damage during the first round or something the field might be more even.

Personally, I don't see anything wrong with the 1st ed.  It is a great boardgame for those who are tired of RPGs & want the adventure aspect of them.  It's like an RPG with everything in place without having to waste so much time creating characters & encounters.  & it's expandable!  The rating of "8.5" is due to the fact it was a slow game with 4-5 players.  It is a "9.5" with 2-players, giving less time to wait around & more time to enjoy the "flavor text" of the cards & see the world of RUNEBOUND unfold.

Great game to introduce young players into the hobby.  I got this for my nephews, 10 and 12, and they are hooked.  Great graphics, easy game play and relatively quick.  Enough fantasy flavor to keep them interested.  I rate this a "7" with 3 players, lower with more.  There is a lot of down time when other players are taking their turns which is tolerable with a few players but makes this game boring with more.

I've amended my opinion of this one after playing Return of the Heroes. Runebound is excrusciating. GREAT bits and theme. Yet those movement dice eat a big bowl of butt. They eat up soooo much play time. After you roll them, you have to decipher them. Then you have to try and apply them to get to where you want to go. When that doesn't work, you have to re-assess your turn. 

The dice just plain suck.

RATING: 7
I do like this game better than Talisman because it gives you a lot more choices and depth.   it also fixes the encounters and movement within Talisman.   However, I think the game still lacks depth.

I don't think it works well 6 players.  The reason is that there is very little player interaction.   You take your turn and then wait 15 minutes or more to interact with your solo adventure.   It's a race to the encounters and markets which is randomly determined by the dice you role.  From this point of view it's very frustrating.   The dice movement is a clever mechanic but I think there would be better methods that could have been employed.   There are also a few characters that are extremely weak as compared to others.   I also have found that the additional character skills really don't help that much in the current version of the game.   The game is easily 3-4 hours with 4 players and 5-6 hours for 6 players.  I think that's way to long for a game that does not have a lot of strategy.   The battle mechanic is very time consuming and each player must have a battle with each encounter.  There is little incentive not to battle so therefore it takes forever between turns.   If you decide to play with friends, I suggest bringing a book to read inbetween turns.

RATING: 9
A very well done Talisman wanna-be. More freedom of movement with the board set up, but limited in the amount of experience points available to earn (an issue that is apparently changed in the second edition). Overall, a fun and challenging game. Also, like a few other games I own, this one didn't get a 10 because Talisman was there first.

With the release of the 2nd edition, this game almost moved up to 10. The harder dificulty, the reappearing experience tokens and the chance for a random encounter have really enhanced the game. The delay in the release of the expansions (which the website still says are to be released last month) is, unfortunately, keeping this great game from an upgrade to a 10.

This game renewed my quest to create a game, very similar to this, that I began designing with the "Outdoor Survival" game.

I recently received the 2nd Edition of Runebound throught FF's Upgrade Option (send in a 1st Ed character card and get 2nd Ed for $20 +s/h).  It seems to have improved several graphical problems with the map and upped the difficulty of the game, but for the most part it is the same game.

I was not very happy with the movement dice they packed in though (seem kinda cheap).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I gave it a 7 because my family and I really love this game.  I would have rated it higher if it was the 2nd edition.  I didn't realize that 1st edition had limitations on expansions and that I needed the 2nd edition.  Anyway it is a great game you can play with your family and still have time to visit without too much strategy and it gives you the feeling of your character leveling with all the equipment and party members that you gather.

RATING: 5
This game is very immersive and fun with the addition of house rules.  The game system lends itself well to tweaking for your game group's tastes, as well as being able to incorporate your own adventures into the mix.

It gives you that D&D feel, without the hassles of interacting with players.  The main problem is just that:  little interaction.  Like playing golf, you play against the field, not the players.

Everytime I play this game I end up really just wanting to play DnD or another RPG.  I like the idea of an RPG boardgame but I havn't found a system yet that feels quite good enough yet.

Nice bits and colorful pieces.

This game is not good.  Like Talisman it turns into a tedious crawl across a board.  Seriously people just play a one shot of D&D, if you think its too geeky why are you even playing this?  This is a childlike facsimile of an RPG.  Its not fun with kids its not fun with adults, I have found it doesn't have good re-playability, after you play it a few times you've seen what it can do (not much).  I know I'm in the minority camp here but I would not recommend any version of Runebound to anyone it is a bad game.  Play descent instead, far more interesting.

Yet another attempt at the ultimate fantasy adventure board game. While the game looses a few points for being unoriginal, it is still a good game. The game looks great, and the components are of good quality. The art on the character cards is really nice. The game play is fairly good, but again has been done before. It's you basic travel around the board killing monsters,buying item and allies,and kill the big boss monster type of game. The one thing about this game that rubs me the wrong way is the movement mechanics. Rolling the die with all the little symbols and then only being able to move through terrain that corespondes to the symbols on the dice. GRRR.... it sucks not being able to get a city because you couldn't roll a plains for 3 turns! I still liked the game and will be picking upa copy soon.

Sort of an advanced Talisman but with much more decision making and freedom of choice. Actually quite a good game in the RPG boardgame genre, but the 1st edition was much too easy,and its combat too random. 2nd edition fixed all of those problems.

RATING: 6
Pretty good game, but it was  too easy to survive.  Maybe one could limit to one companion...  Just too easy to 'sop off' damage on the underlings, cancelling your own with armor and stuff.  Once you survive early encounters, really, there is little to challenge you.  The people I played with were killing things on single throws- a bit of a lack of drama.  Not sure which I like better yet, this or Talisman.  I liked the movement dice, but it might be nice to add some 'racial characteristics' to the moves, allowing dwarves faster moves in Mountains, and Trolls in swamps, or something.  The only other mild complaint is that it felt like they gave the minimum amount of 'stuff' in the base game, intending to make expansions for further play mandatory... Not a terrible game, but I prefer Magic Realm for this type of thing.

One of my favorites as a kid was Talisman so I had to try Runebound.  I only played it for an hour to try it out and would certainly give it another go, but it didn't invoke the excitement I had playing Talisman (the orignal edition, not the reprint).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A lot of fun.  Plays like a more in depth Talisman game.  The board design makes movement more interesting then the talisman game. The charactors are also more varied then in Talisman.  This is a great game for RPG fans.

Play with 3 or 4 max. Otherwise it is really long between turns

Pros: - Full of theme
- Takes less time than a real D&D campaign
- Can be played with beer
Cons: - No player interaction whatsoever
- Lots of downtime (15-20 mins between turns in a 4-player game)
- Game took 5.5 hrs to complete
- Not much decisions to be taken... thank god for the movement dice!

A game that everyone seems to compare to Talisman, yet having played it, it was obvious to me at any rate, that this owes so much to Barbarian Prince as a design. This game being multi-player as opposed to BP being solo. Adventure cards as opposed to BP having an adventure booklet. For all that, it is superb.

Nice components as per usual with Fantasy Flight. Quick rules read-through give impression of easily digestible gameplay. Tentative first rating as something was missing from the gameplay.

Great board game implementation of a RPG style game. You need to take on the more powerful enemies early before another player does! 
With a number of players approaching the maximum there is quite a lot of downtime, but with upto 4 players this is not a problem.

RATING: 6
Another fantasy adventure game in a similar mold to Talisman, in that each player is in a race to gain experience, acquire equipment and generally bulk up in order to take on more difficult quests, with the ultimate aim being to defeat Lord Margath and the Dragonlords before someone else does.

The game uses novel icon dice to determine movement options through various terrain. The flavour text on the cards and the use of various cities complete with Marketplaces, where equipment and items can be purchased, give the game a strong sense of theme and make the world believable.

The reality however is that this is basically a multi-player solitaire game. Sure the heroes can attack each other, and good players probably do but it doesn't constitute more than 10% of the game. 

There are some balance issues with some items like the White Sword being way too powerful for there own good and typos plague many of the card's text.

Still a cool game but I'm hoping that 2nd Ed. fixed many of the problems found here. In any event the game is crying out for solo play and that is where I am headed with my 2nd Ed copy!

Another game that I really wanted to like.  It has exploration, power-ups and a fantasy-ish theme.  What's not to like?  The parts, though, are less than the whole, and I think what the game really lacks is pacing.  I mean, ultimately one does the same thing over and over, and there is very little player interaction except to get some place first.  In other words, despite the elements and production bits, the game is dry.  Compare the pacing of this game to "Betrayal at the House on the Hill."  In my opinion the latter provides a much better exploration / rpg gaming experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
In a fantasy world, guide a character through various encounters. Roll dice to determine the terrain you can move through, decide on whether to go into a town to buy goods, or encounter different levels of monsters (green, yellow, blue, red). Earn experience points and make your character stronger. Win 3 red battles to win the game, or destroy the Evil Lord yourself. Dice is rolled in combat, so there is a lot of luck. It's a cute game, and it will take at least 2-3 hrs to play, but it is an engaging experience. Now I admit, the freshness factor of each game will go down, but there a ton of expansions. It does take a long time to play, so players really have to enjoy the experience throughout the game.

About what I expected but a little better. I don't see the reason for these games - they take a long time, require you to role play to get any real enjoyment, and have little opportunity for clever play. I'd much rather spend this time with a real role playing game, which offers me unlimited (for the most part) options, rather than the meager choices found in games of this type. If asked to play by my group (and there were no other alternatives) I would happily join in, but that's as high as the praise is going to get from me for any board game RPG.

Fairly entertaining Talisman-like game.  Runs a bit too long and the costs for several of the items seems out-of-whack to me.  Great for playing with older children.  So-so for adult play as there is relatively little decision making.  The sort of game you might enjoy for five times, then shelve.

Snatched it up from Black and Read used/complete for 20 bucks! Awesome game, playable not only by 2-6, but I think by 1 with a few rule changes/omissions, and as long as you still use dice to move, instead of getting lazy and just moving...it keeps it fun.

My rating is based on a single play of this game with three players, but a good time was had by all.  The game is hugely luck dependent and most every action boils down to 'roll X or above to win', but sometimes that's just what I'm in the mood for.  The game seemed rather lengthy for the 'depth' of it, but the time flew by fast enough that we hardly even noticed.  I imagine this rating will go down with repeated playings as I learn the cards and events (I enjoy suprises in games like this), but everyone who played is excited to give it another play so it must have done something right!

Ok I have played it a few times now and can’t wait for my next game. This game will be a true classic. I put the game up to a 8 now I have worked out how to conduct PvP combat.Example combat
1) Player A moves into Player B’s space and declares combat
2) Player B gets to do before combat actions
3) Player A gets to do before combat actions
4) Escape phase -- player A only allowed to escape
5) Ranged phase -- player A declares what he will be attacking with hero or ally or if defending hero only. Player B now declares what he will be attacking with hero or ally or if defending hero only. Both roll dice and add in all dice modifiers they can. Player A  wins if he can equal or better Player B’s score. If the winner (A or B) was attacking then the loser takes the appropriate damage. If the winner was defending then no damage is done.
6) Melee phase – as ranged phase
7) Magic phase – as ranged phase
8) Back to escape phase. Now both players can try to escape if the want to, if only one wants to escape then an escape roll is made. If both want to then no escape roll is needed.

This makes sense of the PvP combat, it is fair and both sides can use all their stuff and Dragon runes etc.

What a great game. Played the game three and I'm eager to play it again.

Has lots of possibilities for expansion and it's very fun to play...

I was really impressed with the first two plays. The last one was a bit of a turn down, because it took too long (a two players game) and in the end it was too easy for the weakest player (me) to win the game...

But I still believe it's a great game!!!

I bought this game because of the good ratings most users gave this game, but Me and my game group were very disappointed.

I'm a huge fan of talisman, and I can certainly see parallels between both games. Runebound adds additional features that are supposed to make the game more strategic, but all they do is to take the speed out of game that could be really fun if it only had a faster pace. Example: Due to the "innovative" movement system I was unable to leave the forest I had entered to fight a difficult quest for three turns, because I did not roll a single forest symbol. This is frustrating beyond belief. You had the same problem in talisman, where you could miss the field you wanted to reach for several turns due to unlucky die roll. In talisman however, it does not matter on which field you land on, something is always happening. Runebound is, to be honest, quite boring.

This game is very boring and slow, though I think it has the potential to be fun with tweaks - hence the reason for a 6 rating (4 otherwise). I also think it is overpriced and I don't like the idea of all the expansions when the game is long enough as it is.

RATING: 6
This game can be fun, but can also suffer quite a bit from a run-away leader problem, and the starting player has a clear advantage.

RATING: 7
As a dungeon-crawl fan, I can say that Runebound is a very good game with mechanics similar to Talisman but a bit deeper and more various. Artwork is very good too (also if totally recycled from Vortex...).
The only problems for me are the game challenge and the balance of object/allies: it's a bit too easy gain Gold and the various Monsters are not so difficult to beat; on the other hand the game needs the erratas/FAQ from the FFG site to become quite balanced. A real pity.
Furthermore game sessions are veeeeery long...
The Advanced Rules seem more a sort of 'patch' to improve the game, but they fails in my opinion... I use only a pair of minor changes.
Finally, the game is open to new expansions which - I think - can improve it a lot in terms of replayability.

RATING: 7
I like this game, even if it does have a generic fantasy theme slapped on (who is Mordrog and why do I care?).  The mechanics are...interesting.  I could care less for the movement "terrain" dice-much too much time is spent figuring out how to use them to get where you're going.  But I do like the combat system and character building system.  Challenges are tiered, which means you determine the difficulty of the challenge you face. I don't particularly like the randomness of the Market...and that a low level character can just purchase an overpowered ally or item for relatively low cost (nothing over 10 gold). I'm not sold on the d20 system either, but it works. Overall, though, it's fun, and I'd play it again. Update: Moved rating to 7 from 6...I added a few house rules to balance things out, making the game play much more exciting. Update: moved it back up to 7.  I've actually found myself pulling it out quite a bit.

The Martin Wallace games I have played always fall victim to the mechanics overshadowing the atmosphere, and this is no exception.  It just doesn't really have the feel of a fantasy world to me.

Probably one of the better and more well-rounded attempts at such a feat in about 10 years or so (similar in bent to Talisman--but not a substitute--given only as a matter of reference).  Game can drag on a bit with many players, and until less experienced ones get the hang of rolling off on challenges, can generate a bit of tedium.  All that aside, a fairly balanced game with great illustrations, high-quality components, a website supporting it, and expansions on the radar.  Very worth the money--particularly if purchased through a discount retailer on line.  Love the D20 (as opposed to D6) and the open-ended movement, combat, and adventure system--nothing linear here.

Really liked this game. It feels like an old style classic game - but with modern rules. "Does what it says on the tin". I'm glad that I bought this one and I look forward to the expansions. Shame that there's downtime between turns.

It is great game!
In spite of I like RPG I have no chance to play RPG game.
Runebound is my first game among RPG.
I enjoyed it with my brother and my friend who studyed in canada.
My other friends are not interested at RPG because it take long time.

RATING: 7
Enjoyable, nice effort on components, mechanics and theme. 'Multi-player solo' criticisms largely valid. Not sure I'd pay price for 2nd ed when 1st now so cheap, however great the improvements. Really enjoyed my first play, but the 'flavour text' loses its appeal after that.

RATING: 6
An enjoyable adventure game, plays well solo though would not play with more than 3 (since this game is the dreaded 'multiplayer solitaire'. Certain house rules required to make this not overstay, most importantly changing the leveling costs to N exp = next level (3exp to move from lvl 2 to 3, 7exp to move from lvl 6 to 7).

RATING: 7
Of the dungeon crawling games, it's a fun game that's portable and offordable (when compared to others in its class).  I think playing with more players slows things down and doesn't really add things.  I think 2-4 players is the best range.

I think I want this.  Lack of interaction sounds a bit dicey though and the innumerable expansions either thrill or scare me - not sure which.

RATING: 5.5
Don't like the dice graphics and the movement mechanic.  I mean, really - having analysis paralysis over how to best use these multi-iconed dice is not fun (especially when it's not my turn).  I'm not happy with the fact that I have the first edition and then they made a 2nd edition + expansions that are not compatible with the original.  A lot of the rules seemed kind of ambiguous, especially the combat rules when Allies are involved.

Who knows - this was my first play and we only made it about 1/2 way through in 2 hours with 3 players (albeit young ones).  I can see things getting better on future plays but not necessarily enough to raise my ranking of it.  My son and my friend's son enjoyed it, so I'm hoping to table it again.

NOTE:  I have owned this game since it game out in 2004, but have not found ANYONE in 7 years to play it with.  I have always wanted to play it and am glad I did.  I just didn't like it as much as I thought I would and am mildly upset that 1st edition isn't supported by more than 1 expansion, etc.

RATING: 10
Played this game many time now. 2 to 4 players. This game is going to be a classic. When they start getting out the expansions, its just going to get better and better. I highly recommend this game. Lot's of great support from BGG community.

The best of the best among the adventure games available.  Cards have nice artwork, board is beautiful and colorful. Downside, a bit repetive, not an easy teach with the movement die.

It really needed an upgrade. 2nd ed. is the way to go. Tokens & dice cannibalized by my 2nd ed.

RATING: 4
Pros: Nice color; nice variability; clean system.

Cons: Low interactivity, long downtime, a bit long overall (the last really only true with 4+ players).

I'd call the new edition 1.5, not 2.0. It's absolutely filled with minor changes, and they every one make the game better. It's impressive, because you don't often see this type of game redevelopment.

Overall, above average for an adventure game of this sort, though I'm becoming less impressed with it as FFG comes out with more in the same genre.

RATING: 5
Good game for what it sets out to be:  a role-playing game squeezed into a boardgame (although I would have liked to see more emphasis on experience).  In any case, it just isn't my cup of tea because there is SO little player interaction.  I played the expansion, and the cards that supposedly give player interaction tend to be unsubtle, unfair and lack any guise of strategy.  Ending on a good note:  it really doesn't need to take as long as many people here are making it out to be.

Adventure. Some cool stuff in here, but just didn't quite grab me; perhaps overly complex for the payoff. I hear the second edition is improved, but I'd as soon play some more recent RPGish games (Return of the Heroes, Descent, Prophecy) for this style/play duration.

RATING: 6
Effective light fantasy board game.  Really scratches whatever itch you have to play D&D without coordinating a bunch of people together.  The great movement system, fun combat and lots of neat items keep players enthralled.  The fact that players can attack each other always keeps you on your toes.  I can't imagine playing this with more than three though as the downtime would seem too high and the experience points would be stripped off of the board way too quickly.   Perhaps it would be nice if there were random encounters.  It is what it is, but what it is is fine.

UPDATE: That said, I haven't played it since it first came out, as I hadn't had an overwhelming desire to do so.  Perhaps the second edition will make this more tableworthy.

I always have fun playing this game. I never care if I win this or not. It's just really fun to advance your character, buy cool items and clobber the monsters. It might not have a ton of strategy but it's still a great way to spend a few hours with friends. Second Edition makes the first edition totally pointless.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The reason I can't get into Runebound is that the discovery and adventure aspects through interaction with the game system is lacking. Aside from the excellent terrain dice mechanic, a player only interacts by drawing cards and maximizing modifiers. 

A lot of design work was put into trying to convey theme through artwork, story, and card flavor text, but it feels strained during the game as players attempt to infuse theme by reading for flavor. The basic player interactions with the mechanics of the game are dry and redundant with little sense of discovery and adventure.

I have not played the 2nd edition.

RATING: 7
This game is a blast. Reminds me a lot of an advanced Talisman. My only complaints are you run out of adventures too quickly, so if you are behind, it is almost impossible to catch up. Also, the terrain dice are interesting mechanic, but takes a while to figure how to get places.

Runebound is an updated Talisman with a few strengths compared to the classic GW game. Still you typical level up and beat the baddy game with less player interaction, since the board is much more difficult to navigate.

RATING: 4
I've only played first edition once. Having played both editions, I find most of the changes in Second Edition for the better, except that the multiples on the experince upgrade tokens were removed. Starting everyone in the corner in the first edition is unbalancing. I don't understand why 2nd Edition deserves a separate entry on BGG, but I have corrected my notes to account for this. I have revised this rating down after playing Descent because I enjoyed Descent more. Runebound is just odd in that it gives the feeling of a cooperative game, but it's not. I rated this game below 2nd Edition because I preferred 2nd Edition as mentioned before.

Nice fantasy game. There's a lot of fantasy element in it so, if you like fantasy, play this game. Some players may not like a combat system based on die rolls, but overall, is a cool game. More than four players makes the games very long though, but using the Doom Track from the advanced rules should solve it. Great set of expansion and a lot of degree for customization.
Overall, a really good game.

Played it quite heavily when we first got it.  It takes a bit too long to play for it to be a regular game.  I enjoy most of the mechanics, although some items seem too powerful.  I need to check out the revised rules.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This game is interesting (not gripping or exciting, just interesting) when it is your turn. It's almost entirely irrelevant when it is not your turn though, and short of attacking other players (which takes forever in itself), there's really no interaction. There's never a whole lot on the line in any encounter, and yet you'll need to do a zillion of them before completing the game.

In short, I'm a roleplayer, and even I really don't like playing this game. It's a fun experience once or twice, but it's just a pretty face - there's nothing really going on with this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I have a soft spot for fantasy adventure games, and this is one of my favourites. It's a bit on the long side, but if you keep the number of players limited to two or three and nobody dawdles, downtime should be minimal. Even the base game without any expansions provides enough variety to plays this several times a year.

RATING: 7
After two sessions I can say I like the game mechanics and the game itself. Movement simulates very well different terrain types, combat is very well defined and has tactical elements, allies and items are great and different town locations with their own market piles is a good idea. Individual characters with skills and development via experience works pretty well. However, as we had sessions of 5 and 6 players, waiting of your own turn can take up to 15 minutes! This game should be played with 2-4 players to keep game flowing smoothly. Also, if one player gets left behind in progress, it's almost impossible for him to catch up since all easy and moderate challenges he could take have already taken (usually). Some house rule to this could be applied..
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The theme is great and the game looks good. The mechanics however are lacking IMO altough the game does work alot better than Talisman (comparison is inevitable). Some things that annoy me about Runebound: lack of player interaction, huge downtime between turns, too many obvious decisions, huge imbalances, anti-climatic endgame, too long for what it is... I still give a 6 cause the theme is wonderful and the game can be fun with the right group of people. With some rules changes and expansions this might have potential to become better in my view.

Filled with theme. Very light. A lot of luck. I've played with 4, would never play with more than that. Too much down time between turns. Rating my go up with more 2 and 3 player plays. Well after a few more plays I would rather play Candyland.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
While I like this game, I cannot dispute the fact that (1) it cannot be played with 4 or more because it is not worth playing for 2+ (or 4+) hours; (2) the die rolling for movement contributes to FIFTY PERCENT of the downtime in the game; (3) combat for new players may take 5 minutes.  That being said, it's fun to run around, kill stuff, loot their bodies, level up, and kill more stuff.  It just needs some more elegance in the gameplay.  Maybe best, actually, as a 2 player "race" to the top.

Runebound - if it wasn't for the downtime between player turns, I would rate this one higher. We have definitely had fun with this game but be prepared for long waits inbetween player turns.  Recently announced expansions will give this game longevity as it is a fun fantasy themed game.

While this is a really fun game, there is, as many people have mentioned, a problem with one player dominating the entire game right out of the gates.  It also relies a lot on luck, which is some people's thing, just not mine.

RATING: 4
03/26/06: I loved this game originaly (rated it as high as 8) but now it bores me.
This game has quite a bit of proplems that might have been fixed in the 2nd Edition but I am not interested enough to shell out more money to find out. (Thanks again for nothing to Heidelberger Spielverlag who refused to upgrade my copy last year at Essen...)
The shortcomings of this game in short (in increasing order of severness):
- No player interaction at all.
- Takes far too long.
- Too much downtime.
- Too random. I *love* dice-fests but there is no strategy at all involved in this game.
- The character-development has almost no influence on the game. It doesn't matter how many increases you have bought with experience - it is the items and the allies that matter. I won yesterdays game with just two advances while everybody else had six!
- The characters are horribly unbalanced. Some are killing machines out of the box while others are whimps until the end.

05/06/07: I finally bought the 2nd Edition last December and played it a few times last month. BTW, I played it only recently because, among other reasons, my set was incomplete and Heidelberger needed two months to send me the  missing adventure cards! Again: Thanks for nothing ladies and gentlemen at Heidelberger Spieleverlag! When will FFG finally find a better dirstributor here in germany???
Concerning the game I am happy to say that many issues have been solved. There is still little interaction and I wouldn't play it with more than three because of the downtime, but I found that the game vastly improved from the first edition.

This is a pretty fun fantasy adventure game, but naturally it has its flaws.  The movement dice, while certainly an interesting way to handle moving from place to place, can be a little arbitrary at times.  I've seen players mired down turn after turn unable to roll what they need while another player gets five dice that all work perfectly together to whip right past the first guy.  Stuff like that can be annoying at times.  The system is still fun as there is a lot of combat and interesting gear.

If it weren't for some oviously too powerful and therefore broken item cards(example: The Teleport Rune, and that shield which cancels two wounds to give your opponent one damage) and the fact that this game starts out very inspiring but ends up in a drag, I'd rate it an 8. Great combat system, great levelling up and quests that do well concerning their toughness. They are just right to give some challenge while not being impossible.

RATING: N/A
Pretty good game.  A bit of a Talisman feel, but with tighter rules, although there are still some holes (check out the FAQ/Addendum from the website to fix some of these).  Some production issues (at least with mine), with some screwups on the character cards.  Still able to play though, perhaps the newer edition will fix this.  Expansions could really open this game up!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Not worth the price. It fails to have any real tension, if you land on a space, you can choose to encounter it, but you don't have to. Unlike Talisman, where most of the time, no matter which way you go, you'll have to flip an adventure card. I will say that the movement dice are cool. But the fighting phases are not that exciting. Maybe with a few rule changes it could be good, but then I might as well just play another game.
I don't want to compare it to talisman, because it's nowhere near as interesting. Sorry guys.

Lowered my rating considerably, from 7 to 4. I really really really want to like this game. But the downtime and poorly - but prettily - written rules are too much. We don't play with PvP rules because we cannot agree on how to play them. I think that with the OWL rules, it would help a lot. I just can't stomach getting people to accept these changes, when there are many better games for me to play. I'm hoping Return of the Heroes is better.

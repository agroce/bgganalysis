I own the original peri box version. This game is good on a number of levels, it helps children with maths and learning number patterns. Obviously if your maths skills are poor then this is not game for you, however those who have a good grasp of maths and probability will love the game play and strategy.

Rulebook in great need of clarification.  Tried this once and put it away after 2 rounds of play and 10 minutes.  Willing to give it another try but didn't go over well with social games who would have much rather been playing Scrabble.

Played a lot against computer. Very good abstract game, a lot of thinking involved. You must to be good with mathematics. 

I have the feeling that some Knizia's scoring methods are inspired in this one.  

My father has a copy.

Have been playing this for years, mostly with my dad - I would say the level of enjoyment in playing this game is relative to whom you play with.
There is something feeling like missing from the play however, I can't put my finger on it. Will always have a place in my gaming cupboard nonetheless.

A bit long with 4 players. Simple rules, keep the overview and place you tiles. Plays better with 2, also as a game for non-gamers.

RATING: 3
A grinding game of arithmatic. Draw tiles, crunch numbers to find best spot for tiles. Wait for next turn....
There's not a lot of room for strategy or deep decision making and the downtime can be enormous. Blech.

There seems to be a quest out there to find the perfect 'scrabble without the letters' game. With every new game I play that attempts to be this game, I realize that the scrabble system just isn't that interesting on its own. Seemed a little too long.

RATING: 5
There's almost a very good game here, but not quite.  Forward planning is impossible, since you have no knowledge of your opponent's hand nor can you hold any tiles over to the next turn.  So what you have is a pure game of tactics.  You just score what you can this turn, and try to limit your opponent's options for the upcoming turn.  The end game is very unsatisfying, but can probably be fixed with a simple variant: the game ends immediately if neither player has a playable tile (and don't score negative points for tiles left in hand).

Has a lot of similarities to Scrabble in the tile positioning.  Like Scrabble, I suspect this game is best with 2 players.  Since I like the word-building aspect of Scrabble I don't think I'll ever choose Zatre over it, but I can see a niche here for those who like the more mathematical aspects of Scrabble without enjoying the word play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Average tactical game without long term planning. Looks dated and lasts too long with 4 players. There are much better abstract games around with a similar concept. I would prefer Ingenious any time.

Bougth from Essen 2007. Comes better and better, when you play it more. Kind of Scrabble-experience. No that much hard thinking, but more like reacting different kind of situations. There is luck-factor, but for this kind of "coffee-game" it doesn't ruin the game.

RATING: 5
So now I see what a good game 24/7 is. Zatre is too long , not very thrilling and you cannot plan ahead.

They allways said: ´I like the gameplay of Scrabble but I don´t like to play with words...´
´Oh! So let´s play Zatre! It´s a bit like Scrabble but using numbers instead of letters´ was my answer!

RATING: 5
Relaxing game for two. Unfortunately, play is limited by its scoring system, which pretty much forces players to pursue just one strategy: fill in your rows as evenly as possible (not always easy admittedly). Gameplay is very tactical, much more so than other draw-tile(s)-and-play games such as Carcassonne and Iron Horse/Metro, because unlike those games, you can't plan ahead, or "claim" a portion of the board as your own. [10 plays; gave away]

This and Topas are two similar games, of placing tiles / playing cards to form rows which add up to a scoring number. Zatre's slightly better as you have the choice of making up 10s, 11s or 12s (as opposed to just 7s), plus the lure of hitting the doubler spots with a scoring tile to get score doublers, plus playing to the scoring driver of wanting to score equal numbers of 10s, 11s, 12s and doublers so as to get set bonuses, which may modify your play away from the obvious "get 12s all the time". With just two tiles to play each turn, your options are purely tactical and driven by the scoring options left you by previous players, and taking into consideration how not to setup the next player with your play if possible. Downtime can only be spent counting, counting, counting rows to determine possible spots to go in future. Not that exciting. For such a tactical and abstract game, the game also goes way longer than it should. I've felt I've fully explored it after one play and have no need to play again.

This is the 300th game in my collection. Not one that I wanted like crazy but I like it as an abstract game for a quiet evening. Already owned the card game version which I think is best for 2-players. Hope this one stays :)

RATING: 4
Easy-to-learn abstract game, where you take a die side, with 1-6 pips, and attempt to form 10s-11s-12s. You get bonus points for sets and special tiles let you double your scores. It can be as deep as you want it to be.

Este é um jogo que eleva a matemática ao rubro e que com grande facilidade consegue fazer o tempo passar sem se dar por ele. Um jogo com tudo para se afirmar mas que talvez tenha surgido um pouco cedo de mais, já que se fosse lançado actualmente, é provável que obtivesse maior visibilidade e reconhecimento. Suporta até 6 jogadores, é agradável a 3,4, e 5, conhecendo o seu modo fantástico a 2.
Conjuga a matemática com um pouco de táctica e muito poder de observação. Único senão, as regras não permitirem que se retire as peças antes do nosso turno começar, ou seja, não é permitido o planeamento antecipado, unicamente o instantâneo, contudo, esta contrariedade é facilmente superável com o acordo de todos os participantes... Obrigatório!

This is much more like a puzzle than a game. Draw two tiles and see where you can place them.  I'm not sure that there is any decision here.  Really.  Although, I guess it is kind of relaxing...zzzzzzz.

Played a quick demo at Essen '05: scrabble with numbers (d6 faces, actually). Simple to learn, with some luck in the draw; but fun to play, and I think a skilled player would usually win. Not available in mass market US, although GameSurplus seems to have it ... so maybe we'll get it (if we ever actually play all the games we already brought from Essen!)

Tedious figuring out the best play of your roll of 2 six sided dice, and that is the extent of the strategy. Finish order is based on how many doubling squares the player was fortunate enough to score on. Likely better with 2 players only, but it is unlikely that I will try.

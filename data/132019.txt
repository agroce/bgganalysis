Great continuation of a great series.

1st St Albans: Clearly just a learning scenario, not much of a game. Lancaster really have an uphill battle here. Still, a good way to get a handle on the system.

RATING: 8
Men of iron rules have been further refined. I felt archers were too powerful in the base game - here appears much more balanced. Good range of scenarios. All very playable in an evening (not played Towton yet though). 

Rules on a par with simple GBoH. Still finding it a very quick playing game not all the scenarios are very balanced but there are plenty of options for less historical but more balanced suggestions throughout.

This was my first "chits and hexes" wargame. It was a period of history I knew little specific about so the learning experience kept me going. It has a interesting back and forth flow, where individual "turns" were much more fluid and extendable.

Interesting but ultimately, it felt a little samey as I played it solo and it is clear that the interest in this game comes from the interaction between players plans.

So far have been able to play 1st St. Alban's, Tewkesbury, Blore Heath, Barnet, and Bosworth. I'm really enjoying this system as it strikes a nice balance for me between playability, theme, and complexity. I am not known for being able to play scenarios quickly but it looks like most of these should be easily manageable in a few hours. 

Dropping this down from an eight to a seven. I find I'm not as infatuated as I was initially. Nonetheless, very fun.

RATING: 9
Same system as Men of Iron, but the Wars of the Roses seems like a much better context. Not a great deal of tactical subtlety in evidence in these battles, but the fun comes from the micro-decisions to be made, about when to rally, to seize, or to risk an attack with a disrupted unit or with a leader in the lead (the death rate among the nobility is very high). Add the new types of Seizure (treachery, into the breach) and you have a great system. The quintessential English landmarks only add to the fun. Superb.

It is good. But I'm not convinced that slimming down the GBoH system improves the experience. Sure it's simpler and quicker and you get a good game from this system. But I'd like to see the GBoH system applied to the Men of Iron series.

Feel sometimes that the battlefields are a little cramped. I know Towton should be, but some of the others would be nicer if they were bigger, with more space for manoeuvre...

RATING: 8
This is the only game in the Men of Iron series I have played, so can't comment on it it in comparison to the others.
Not overly complex, this game has no conventional game "turns", with players attempting to continue activating their wings (called "Battles" in this game) of their armies until they fail to activate with a DR against a Battle commander's Initiative rating after which their opponent may activate. Thus command quality is a vital factor in this game. The seizure rule adds a twist to this.

Recently played Blore Heath, an absolute catastrophe for the Lancastrians. Audley opened the battle with a gallant mass charge with his mounted Men at Arms. They were mostly disordered crossing the brook and were then shot to smithereens by Yorkist longbowmen. This pretty much decided the battle and the Lancastrians reached their Flight Level after hardly any shock combat.

The moral of the story: Don't go anywhere near enemy longbows with mounted Men at Arms! This game illustrates well why they rarely fought on horseback in the Wars of the Roses. (I am a great admirer of Richard Berg but he may have possibly made the longbows are a tad too lethal in this game).

rating after one play (Bosworth, victory as Richard III).

the theme comes thru, and the units and tactics are interesting.

there are certainly some very big die rolls that will impact how the game goes (continuation, flight, etc.).  I think they work in a short and simple game though, and I think it fits the theme of the chaotic situations of the period battles.

Good tactical game of the Wars of the Roses.  Not difficult to learn or play.  Definitely worth acquiring by those who enjoy games of this historical period.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting period, interesting system. The activation system does an excellent job in steering you towards historical outcomes: e.g. at Barnet you can see why each side's right wing was dominant, because that's where the good, dynamic leaders are. The activation system means that you too are likely to make much more effective progress on that wing, because those leaders are much easier to get moving.
So it's historical in that sense, but because of the shape of the battles and the primitive tactics used it doesn't always make for the most exciting or variable games in practice: within the restrictions of 15th century English warfare, there's not a lot of manouevre. There's also a problem with how selective the activation system is, in terms of historicity: again using the example of Barnet, it will usually take the Lancastrians 3 full activations to get their reserve into the battle. That's giving up three lots of combat, movement and rallying opportunities with the troops that are actually engaged, so it seems like it would only rarely be worth spending that long on getting them into the battle. In fact, in 7 games or so I've never seen all the troops on both sides get engaged in combat, which feels wrong.
I wonder if the activation system fom Guelphs and Ghibellines could somehow be adapted for this game? That's an elegant solution to the problem.
The dice also seem surprisingly heavily weighted in determining combat. Nothing can be taken for granted here: attacking open order handgunners with dense men at arms will still only give you a +3 on a single 10-sided die. Weight of numbers and especially positioning become key, and indeed the modifiers for flank and rear attacks are massive (total +5 for attacking through both the front and flank), so much so that other factors sort of pale into insignificance in comparison.
Still, it's a nice, playable system which gives historical results (mostly) and some interesting insights into the battles.
It would be good if the victory conditions made any attempt at balance (even something as simple as suggesting a number of Flight Points for the clear underdog to inflict to be considered a creditable performance): if they can do it in Musket & Pike, I don't see why not here. But most of the battles (especially with the optional rules) seem able to go either way anyway, so it's not too much of an issue.
I've played Tewkesbury three times, which is an excellent scenario and can go either way (although in my experience the Lancastrian have been favoured), Blore Heath once and Barnet once. There are a few problems with the latter, mainly based on the fog rules which don't seem properly thought through - missile shooting is at an automatic -3, which is fine, but just making clear terrain cost 2MP to move through causes more problems than it solves (e.g. it becomes impossible for most foot units to move through friendly artillery, turning them into a solid wall on the front line which has to be moved around) and also doesn't seem to make any sense of the fog. Surely concealment or reducing leaders' command radius would make more sense?

Dropped a point as I'm really not sure it reflects history well at all - much too much skipping about the lines for my liking. The units seem much too flexible.

PbeM suitability: high. Battles run to 20 or so logs for the smaller ones, more for the larger ones, usually comprising a single chain of activations. Seizures can be done as interrupts, and in fact this adds to the excitement when you write a log not knowing whether you'll get to actually execute it or whether your opponent will seize. Relies more than most on the honour system, but if you can't rely on that then find new opponents.

Love the historical period and therefore the theme of this game.  Does a nice job of recreating the feel of a late medieval battle.  While a little bit fidgety, it manages to do so without a lot of complication.

Great. Works well and is terrific. Very old school, of course, and it helps if you like GboH. Activation mechanic and the organization into "battles" (units with leader) is interesting. You are watching your neat plans and lines first quaver then dissolve until everything is a pell-mell, grimy struggle. I think that's historical. =)

Played 1st St Albans.  I realy like the MoI series: the battles play pretty fast with enough detail to get a real feel for what went on and the effects of the different units.  Plays very nice as a solo game.  Looking forward to the more involved scenarios when I have some time.

May '16:  Have now played 4 or 5 scenarios, and enjoyed them all.  Have changed history once or twice!  Lots of action in the scenarios, and quick playing makes this the best MoI to date.

Fun and bloody game with potentially heavy casualties, just like the title.  Very playable and teachable game that captures the feel I think, of these medieval battles.

Long bows quite deadly, especially if well supported in formations.  Like the machine guns of the Middle Ages.

Light hex and counter war game set in the War of the Roses. Intuitive rules. 

Today, I have the experience of three session of the 1st St. Albans as well as of one Blore Heath. It's still too early to come to more than a tentative verdict, but the picture is getting more and more detailled.

Its strength is its accessability. Rules and handling are simple since stacking of units is not allowed, and there aren't too many status counters. Not being able to stack is a crucial aspect of the (defender's) tactics: Your units always have to be able to retreat. The other important aspect is movement (for flanking and surrounding, thus capturing of leaders that create your "victory points"). The material is okay (GMT standard), the rules could have been more didactical, respectively the play book (called "battle book") should come with more detailled examples of game play (a tutorial). There are 7 scenarios, which should guarantee for a decent replay value.  

Weaknesses: It's very random and sometimes just unfair. Let me emphasise that I am ABSOLUTELY NOT a no luck snob. I DO want a healthy dose of luck in my games! But with only 1d10 per die roll and very few rolls in the small scenario(s), B&R can turn into a painful experience if you roll just a bit unluckily. I once got literally driven over by a 40t truck in the 1st St. Albans with a total of only 5 free activations and not even one successfull continuity. It's not supposed to be symmetrical balanced combat, I got it -- but hey, this isn't fun, that is pure frustration and nothing else, sorry. Maybe it's possible to mitigate dynamics like these with a 2d10 roll halfed, round up or down dependig on a 1d6 dr (1-3 round down, 46 round up)? Just an idea.

I like the setting a lot. That's not to say that I'm a sucker for this period of time, but it's really refreshing to see a tactical land battle game with hexes and counters and no T34 tanks or similar stuff.

Scenarios played:

1st St.Albans:

3 plays. Wins-Losses: 3-0 for the Yorkist side. Variations tested: Basic, Too Few Longbows and Small World+Tonman enbankment. Treat this scenario as an introduction to the system since it is so small and short. There are some small tactical decisions but it's fairly straightforward. The Basic one is a slaughter. The variations make it slighty more challenging for the Yorkist side. Too Few Longbows probably being the most balanced. In any case the 1st St. Albans tells a great story and it's exciting to see it unfold.

Blore Heath: 
2 play. Wins-Losses: 1-0 for the Yorkist side. 1 tied game. The question is that how long can the Lancastrian player wait for his longbow-men to come to aid and fast he should attack with his Mounted Men-at-Arms. If the Lancastrian player waits for too long then he might run out of time eventually, but I think it is highly unlikely to happen. The Lancastrian player has all the pressure and really has to make a great plan and wise tactical choices in order to win the game. The Yorkist player has to create clever defensive position with his Caltrop-markers. It's a really nice scenario.

Tewkesbury: 
1 play(s). Wins-Losses: 1-0 for the Lancastrian side. Pretty tight and balanced scenario. There is just a lot of shooting through and hiding in cover. It took a bit long to kill enough men to rout the opposing army.

Towton:
1 play(s). Wins-Losses: 1-0 for the Yorkist side. This is huge and slowly moving battle. There are some interesting things here but the playing time and effort(all moving of counters, setup etc.) is just not worth the effort.

Final edit. Great game and very re-playable but after 7 plays I had seen enough.

3 plays via Vassal.  Looks like a good addition to the series.  The subject matter covered by this game is a period of history that really fascinates me so this is my favourite of the Men of Iron series.  The secnarios covered in the game offer a reasonable mix of size of battle.  However some of the scenario specific rules dont work very well, the rules for fog in Barnet in particular could do with being refined.

RATING: 9
The Men of Iron rules are extremely well-written and easy to teach to new players. The new seizure rules using a blind chit draw are an improvement as well as the removal of zones of control. The activation/continuity rules create a nice sense of tension in two player games and work well for solitaire as you never know whether a command will activate or not.I prefer the scenarios in Infidel but that is just a personal preference for that time period and does not distract from this fine game.

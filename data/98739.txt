Great work by the design team..may not be fancy but its one of the most easy area-control games to teach, nevertheless very intriguing to play. You do not get VPs until after the end of actual gameplay, a fact that keeps you on your toes given that turnarounds are soooo easily made within just a few action rounds. Well done.

Innovative mechanic meets area control. This is a fast, simple and light game, with conflict and hidden goals. A number of pre-selected actions are at each player's disposal and he is called to choose the best moment to use them. Other players do not know each other's goal, so suspense builds up during the session. I'd like it even heavier though.

Depending on who you ask this game can be a total waste of time or an average game. I'm on the latter group and had some fun playing the game but feel that there are many games like this in a hundred games.

I read the rules, and there are some things to like. For example, I like that players write their own priorities (ala Careers) and also gain points for correctly figuring out their opponents' goals. I like that there's a menu of different actions (one per turn) that players may only take a limited number of times. I like that having your pretender in an area of contention can give a bonus (effectively 25% higher probability of success) for negotiations and so on. But I'm less thrilled about the effects of the random events (earthquake, famine, plague), especially late in the game. Also, the rules could use a good editor, at least for the English language version.

I had a demonstration of this in Essen.  It sounds like a game I would enjoy playing, but not enough to buy it.  I like area majority mechanics, and I like games where all players have nearly the same tools.  This is not an engine-building game by any means.  I also like games with hidden objectives, but I did not like the concept of having to rank secret locations in advance.  It seems like players might arbitrarily choose locations in a way that benefits some players immediately (e.g. If 3 of 4 players overlap in their goals, the 4th player should begin with a big advantage).

Torn on this. I like the gameplay and the theme. I think it's cool for each player to have the same numbers of the same types of actions. But I don't like the die rolling for disasters, or for the bribing/banashing/cooperating actions. There aren't enough of them for it to even out over a game, and they are decisive. See no reason you couldn't  house rule them away though, and just let those actions always be successful. 

Yes, there is an awful lot of chaos. I don't mind the 'kingmaker' chaos, as in players choosing who to attack - the game and metagame should balance that. But picking the same regions as others can doom your entire game. Maybe picking regions halfway through or something could mitigate that.

Lots of rough spots, but it's a fun enough little game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
As much as I like the secret secret goal choosing mechanism, the game itself is just way too random. Many results come down to a single roll of one die and most of the time it's impossible to mitigate the luck of the die roll. Still based on that I'd probably rate the game a 5 or 6 out of 10 if it wasn't for the crappy rules. I don't know which version is the original language but at least the German and English rules differ in some critical points. For example the "Succession of the patriarch" event: According to the English rules, the newly chosen objective city must not be in the same province as any of the other 6. According to the German rules, however, the newly chosen objective city may very well be in the same province as any of the other 6. Or take the "Campaign" action: While the English rules let you place a garrison token in one city in the province that the Pretender token was moved to (i.e. place a new token on the board, as I understand it), the German rules only let you move one garrison token from one city to another within that province (i.e. a token that has been on the board and even in the same province before). Things like these make a huge difference to the gameplay and I am very put off by having two diverging sets of rules included with the game.

Rating might be half a point too low on the BGG scale.  I really like the limited orders (and their variety), but I'd much (much) prefer a game like this that was completely deterministic.  The die rolls grate with me, and I wish that the resolution of those cases had been handled differently.  I might actually prefer Antike (standard or Duellum) to this - someone mentioned King of Siam as another possibility.

2017-07-18 : first play - it's quiet amazing how they managed to use 8 pages to cover what's maybe 2 pages worth of rules and still leave many holes in it. And that's not taking into account the glaring errors where the main action you can take, and will take during 10 of the 26 player turns, is different from the action "aid" printed on the board. Ever seen a 30 unit turn-track without any numbers printed on them ? well here's your chance. That was my initial impression from laying out the game and reading the rules in preparation for the game. It went downhill from there. There's zero incentive for players not to pick 7 areas in close proximity to each other in your little corner of the board. In addition : the rectangular shape of the board almost insures that the tiny 1-2 province overlap with cities you want will be with only 1 other player so the entire game is spend fighting over those 1-2 provinces, taking a city, losing it again, retaking it - ad nauseam. There's also zero incentive for players to go and mess up somebody's position on the board if they're not in your chosen 7 because the only ones profiting from that will be the 2 other players. If this was ever play-tested, which I heavily doubt, it was by a bunch of UNO players who got overwhelmed by the "complexity" of this game. Another KrapStarter game that should never, ever have seen the light of day. Don't trade for this is you want a real game, this is for collector completionists only.

Luck reigned supreme in this game, and we laughed ourselves silly criticizing it and watching the misfortune of one of the players. A Kickstarter classic, but not in a good way. We liked the hidden move selection, but too much of the game came down to dice rolls. Area control for nongamers.

RATING: 8
Play with 3 seemed to work well.  I'd characterize this more as abstract rather than a 'war' game.  There is conflict, but it's part of the game rather than outright negative attacks.  In other words, the attacks and switches go back and forth.  Good game - looking forward to more plays-  (Surprised by the lower average rating - worth at least watching a walk through.  Wonder if some buy it expecting one thing, and others who'd like it don't know about it.)

Area control with limited movement options. Seemed very old school mean area control game. Not for players that don't like conflict games. End seemed a let down as you have no idea how things are really progressing because the cities people are choosing stays hidden till the end. Clunky design that reminded me of the game Careers from the 50's. Game could have used some help streamlining, I would remove the disaster events as it's heaping random upon random. I would also up the chance to do roll events as 50/50 seems too weak perhaps make it a 4-8 a success as opposed to 5-8. Lower the turns to 25 as well as cross out 5 boxes at the beginning to keep the same amount of uses. Another thought would be some gradual reveals of what a few cities where chosen perhaps at each 10 point mark the players have to reveal a city they chose.

* Kickstarted! *

Territory control game that's done through a limited number of moves. It's an interesting game mechanic but the flaw is that you can end up being ignored or slammed depending on where you are on the map. The rules also need to be revised regarding timing of actions, since they are unclear as to what happens when.

MEGA PLUS: more challenging board on the back
PLUS: unique mechanic, easy to grasp, strategy-based
MINUS: unclear timing rules, board isn't balanced to conflict

Very fun game. I really enjoy how fast paced the game is. I'm still having a bit trouble with the simple die-rolls though. I think for the random events they are ok since there a few more elements to consider other than the die result, but for the actions I think there might be something more needed. 

I will definitely enjoy to bring it more often onto the table and explore a few things I really liked about it.

This is a fun, light-weight area control game with some interesting mechanics. Every player has the same set of actions to choose from but each action can only be carried out a certain number of times per game. You have a player sheet with the actions on and scribble them out with a pencil once you've finished a move, leaving you with less and less choices as the game carries on. I should really play this more often.

My only complaints with the game are that at the start of the game all players have to write down a number of the provinces that they will try to hold (you only score points for the ones you write down), the mechanic itself is interesting, but I've found in practice that people struggle to see the names, especially if they are upside-down and can spell them wrong. This can lead to people not really know which regions they are trying to keep hold of. I wish there was a more obvious identifier for each region. My other complaint is that the round tracker doesn't have any numbers on it. This can make it hard for the players to keep track of which action round it is and that is the only way to ensure that you've taken the correct number of actions and marked them all off on your player sheet. I'm contemplating taking a permanent marker to the board to rectify this.

行動的種類和數量都是固定的，在30個回合裡每回合選一個動作執行。這個點子很有趣非常有潛力，但......整個遊戲玩起來就是樂趣不高，遊戲背景和盒重會讓人以為是策略經營遊戲，但其實遊戲規模不大是個小遊戲。
遊戲的缺點：1.玩家個人自選秘密目標搞不好已經決定一半的勝負，如果選的夠近又和其他玩家不衝突的話是很有優勢的。2.遊戲過程中無用的行動不少，受限於主帥的移動力和其他玩家棋子的位置，常常發生沒什麼有趣又有用的行動可選的情況，偏偏這遊戲的行動數又是限量的很珍貴。3.行動已經夠雞肋難選了，結果還要骰運賞臉才有效果，而且八面骰難滾動，感覺用六面骰其實也可以玩這遊戲不懂為何要堅持用八面骰......

Though this game has some interesting ideas, it suffers from several glaring design flaws.

1. You have a full map and are going to do area-control of a subsection which you choose. If you are choosing on the blind a subsection of the map nobody else will be in, that only will about win you the game by itself. And that is a blind, pre-game decision.

2. First half of the game is spend just saving up actions, doing useless stuff in hope to throw a ruse to anyone else about your intentions. Only the last 15 turns are actually slightly interesting.

3. There are three 'bad' events. If they all hit you, you are hosed. On the other hand, there are 50% die-rolls on a d8 (why a d8? why not a d6? beats me). Make them, and you do well. Lose them, and you lose without having a chance. Talk about having complete and utter randomness in a game that is otherwise all about bluffing, prediction and superior tactics. These mechanics seldom mix well and also here, that is the case.

In our play I had all three events really hitting me, but due to a very lucky streak of dice-rolling made all my original cities even though they were contested. However, someone else had the luck of picking a quiet corner of the map and hence also made all his cities, even with the luxury of giving up his last two actions. So it came down to guessing who had what city and in the end, turn-order. What a lame way to end a game.

Glad I didn't back this game. Feels like the game-design was half finished, they didn't take the time to iron out the few oddities and threw this at Kickstarter. Component quality is nice, but this game really does't do it for me. Won't play this again.

First Impression:

Surprisingly good game. It's a nearly abstract game with a strongly pasted on theme and a lot of flavor details.

The game flows extremely well and is full of player interaction, and in addition has some novel mechanics that make it shine. I mostly enjoyed the strategic planning with the fixed restricted actions and the pregame planning, the need to trash available actions midgame (due to events) which created some extra tough choices for everyone and most of all the spying at the end (trying to guess the capital of each of your opponents).

There are some minor rule ambiguities (which will probably be corrected before it hits the selves)and I disliked the use of the die. It's not a major game element, but I found it unnecessary. The level of difficulty for each player may vary depending on the uneducated pre-game planning, but I need to play more to verify this.

All in all I was pleasantly surprised by this game, it created some novel and strong interaction and I'm looking forward to play it more.

Meh. The basic system is decent, but there are not enough die rolls for the luck to even out. (The game probably needs some other way to modify the rolls.) More importantly, whether or not you match goals with other players at the start of the game has a huge effect on your chances of winning. I am highly unlikely to play the game again without some alternate means of assigning or choosing goals.

The genre for this is super tough and it has some interesting elements. But I did not enjoyed this too much, I'm afraid. I think it has some problems and the dice (especially for the events) can have a major influence for the outcome of the game. 

Also, for example, if two players chose most of the same regions (which is done hidden), that could be devastating for the game - i find this feature quite bad!

Interesting game of guessing and bluffing your way to secure points. Area control with a twist.

This older Haba game is wonderful! It's a great combination of engaging physical design and cute rules. The dice can be annoying, but this is an experience game, not game where you care about winning or losing. Punching a hole through the ice and hoping to catch a bite with your line is great fun. I'm very glad to have tracked this down.

Boring and lacking in terms of rules. The game definitely overstayed its stay, and the rules really seem broken.

Still the kids did enjoy breaking the glass, but never asked to play it again.

Es un juego de osos pescadores. Es curioso el sistema. Los peces son unas pequeñas bolas metálicas que se disponen al azar (se menean) en el fondo de la caza con huecos troquelados. 
Sobre la caja se pone una tapa también con huecos, un folio en blanco y la tapa final del tablero. Los osos, antes de pescar tienen que "agujerear" la capa de hielo. Las acciones se deciden con un dado.. que te permite moverte, agujerear el hielo, o pescar. 
La caña es un iman. Es una carrera a ver quien pesca antes diez peces. 
Incluye una variante, que no utilicé. Es sencillote y entretenido para niños, aunque se puede hacer un poco pesado.

Hacking up the ice and fishing for the metal balls are interesting and fresh ideas. However, they seemed to get old already during the first game. The roll and move mechanism is not very innovative. The children liked the game well but did not aks for a replay.

What an ingenious idea!  Haba really makes some novel games and this is certainly one of them.  With a little tweaking to the dice, this one is really fun.  As is, you often roll actions that are utterly useless, but it's certainly fixable with a little house ruling.

Rated for kids.
FUN game for kids -- mine can hardly stand it as they're waiting for their turn to come around again.  Very innovative design that captures the feel of ice fishing and the anticipation of catching something at your chosen fishing hole.  It's easy to see that this will have some staying power with my kids (currently 4 and 8 yrs. old) - highly recommended game for kids!  The dice rolls can get a bit frustrating, however, especially when the kids have several consecutive rolls on which they can take no action (when all the holes surrounding them have been fished, but they can't seem to roll a movement face on the die).  We've used some house rules where players get to choose which actions to take (the pips on the dice serve more as "action points") and the game ends when one hole is punched in each ice floe (not when one player has 15 "fish").  This speeds the game along, is less frustrating for the kids, and players need to be more careful about movement and decisions to trigger the endgame.
One ding against the game for U.S. users anyway, would be the difficulty in finding A4 paper to use as the ice -- cutting down legal sized copy paper works fine.

Rated as kids game.

Idea:
Eskimos collect fish.

Mechanism:
Roll die and then do action(s) that are allowed. Move your eskimo, punch holes to the box (through paper) or fish (steelballs) through holes (with magnet). Weather may change and holes freeze or whole sections of ice become unstable and inaccessible.

To whom:
Good game for kids, they really enjoyed the punching and excitement of getting fish or if it escapes. Suitable from 4+

A winner.  What a fantastic child's game.  It is also a game that closely follows its theme.  It has many elements my children like: fishing, hidden surprises, nice colors & graphics, poking paper holes, collecting things in bowls, magnets, dice, counting.  The game also involves some dexterity and memory.

Just be careful with these tiny magnets--young children need to be watched closely because these tiny magnetic bearing easily go into ears, noses, and mouths.

Great components--well worth the money--really pleased with this game.

RATING: 10
Most gamers I know would not give this game a 10 since it's a kids game, but that I don't think we should assign greater importance to adult games.  This was a lot of fun!  You are an Inuit and you are ice fishing.  You literally break the ice, which is a piece of A4 paper below the board.  It sounds like you are breaking through ice.  Then, you fish with a fishing pole that magnetically picks up the fish below the ice.  It really captured my imagination, even as an adult, and I appreciated the cultural experience.  I could imagine teaching children about the Inuit and ice fishing, only to be followed up by this game.  It also captured the randomness of fishing.  You are sort of wandering around, randomly poking the ice and hoping to find what you need.  A fun, innovative, imaginative game for kids.  In my opinion, that deserves a 10!

La presentación y los componentes son sublimes, muy divertido con niños de 5+ años. El juego es una genialidad en su producción.

El problema de este juego es la mecánica con el dado, que yo cambiaría porque a veces no haces nada en tu turno y es un poco rollo. El segundo problema son las bolitas, como se caigan...

Es una pena porque si hubieran implementado una mecánica más fluida el juego sería muy muy recomendable.

Picked this up cheap on eBay.de, but not too impressed. Was expecting more. The boys like it well enough, but maybe we are already moving beyond.

The mechanic (punching holes in the ice and fishing) is thematic, but there's not a lot of game there. I guess that could be said for many children's games, but this one just fell flat where others entertained. Maybe it will click after a few more plays.

Update: This is one of the boys' go-to games when they have younger friends over.

The most overrated HABA game that currently comes to mind.  The rules themselves are near to broken and the gameplay is utterly frustrating in so many different ways.  Just with the dice alone you can roll such that 3 turns in a row you have nothing you can even do.  This game is pure gimmick alone and on that toy level it is fun at first.  Poking holes in paper and then fishing to grab magnets.  The thing is, from a fishing perspective, even the cheap "Let's Go Fishing" was more challenging and fun for our son after the initial gimmick of this one wore off (Which took only 2 games).  He still asks to play Let's Go Fishin' after dozens of plays.

REPLACED BY:  Let's Go Fishin', Flossen Hoch!

RATING: 4
Great idea and making the holes and trying to catch fishes is exciting. Unfortunately all the rest is somehow boring: it's all about dice - if you don't get the right "things" then it's possible that you can't do anything. Still have to remember, that this is a game for the kids...

This is by far the best children's game I bought at the Essen Spiel fair: it has a beautiful board that fits the theme, our children (2 and 4 year old) really like the cracking of the ice and the fishing, it has some luck with the dice and the fishing, it has some strategy with the freezing and melting tokens - highly highly recommended and even adults will have a great time playing this game! Really, I can't recommend this game more than enough. A big thumb up!

RATING: 3
Excellent fishing mechanic and theme that appeals to the kids, literally punching holes in the ice (a piece of A4 paper wedged between two boards), then inserting a fishing rod with a magnet on the end down into the hole you punched, picking up fish (steel balls) from the bottom of the sea (the game box) below. There's some gamery bits that don't work all that well, like a die that sometimes freezes up some holes and sometimes blocks off travel routes. And there's lots of luck in the die that tells you whether you can move, punch or fish this turn, so the gameplay's not all great, but the theme gets it played. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Surprisingly fun.  The magnet idea is genius for the kid appeal.  There is some interesting strategy though.

Enormous amount of luck based on location of fish.  Make sure they are evened out across the board because if not it could be a very unfair game.

Amazing game for kids.

Donated to my nephew.

A little much for the very young, but still OK.  Not much more control than in a game of Hi Ho Cherrio.

Pros: rudimentary math.  Turn taking.  Accepting negative consequences and just bad luck.  Minor strategic planning.

Cons: kids might not like to do any action other than fish, and that's a tough learning curve to overcome.  Much is just luck of the dice and luck of the marble distribution.

Not something I'd want to play more than a few times per year.

RATING: 6
Rated as a game for young children with implied fixes in the dice mechanics.

This is children's game whose novelty is much more interesting than it's actual play, at least as far as adults are concerned.  The components are the key for this game...  the fishing pole / ice-hole puncher is quite fun and the suspense a child displays as they draw their catch up out of the ice makes playing worth while.  For adults and children alike your find your selves frustrated with several of the die rolls.  By changing the fish action to a question mark (any action) the game will progress more naturally.

This is a game that looks so much more fun than it actually is.  It is a grand concept that while functional isn't much of a game.  If you roll well you might be able to accomplish something, if you don't you won't.  Then even  if you roll well, you still need to get lucky enough to actually get something on your hook.  Yes it is cute, yes it is cool, but the novelty wears off quickly as soon as you realize how futile it is to attempt to participate in how the game plays out.

I should give this a 2, but the parts are just so fun to play around with that I can't bear to rate it lower.  Strictly for kids.

If you are going to play, take two markers for each person and if you don't roll a question mark on the die, put one in your basket.  If you roll a question mark take them back out again. When you are out of markers your next roll should be considered a question mark, then reset the markers.  It doesn't make this any more of a game, but then at least then you will be participating in the activity.

Great idea! Ball bearings (2 sizes) are placed in the box bottom and randomly distributed, hidden under a piece of paper that acts as ice. On your turn, you roll the dice to see what actions are available to you (move, make fishing hole(s), fish, thaw/freeze ice) and how many times you may execute them. The game ends when a player manages to collect n fish. Big bearings are worth 2VP, small ones are worth 1VP -- player with most VP wins!

Probably would be enjoyable for young children; I'd think they would like the physical aspect of punching the ice and the thrill of getting 'fish' out.  Seems like the tendency to spend several turns stuck and unable to act could be a downer.  Didn't seem fun for adults to me; but I was the only adult playing who didn't like it.

Hát ez a gyerekjáték nekem nagyon tetszik, a prücsköknek szintén! 

A papírlap kilyukasztása fantasztikus ötlet szerintem és 1999-ben talán pont ez az újítás miatt kapta meg az év gyerekjátéka díjat. Ma már szerintem nem nyerne, hiszen elég sok a holt idő, amikor a játékos egyszerűen nem tud mit csinálni, mivel a kockákkal olyat dob és bevallom ez azért elég zavaró tud lenni. Mint a Pachisiban, amikor amíg nem dobsz hatost addig nem tehetsz ki új bábut. És ez akár jó sok kör is lehet. Itt is ez a helyzet, hiszen hiába dobok hat lékfúrást ha a mellettem lévő össze lyuk már nyitva van... És elég sokszor jönnek ilyen dobások. A hőmérséklet változás kocka még ilyen esetekben is nyújt lehetőséget a cselekvésre de ez sem sokat segít az ilyen helyzeteken.

Kids do love this game. It's one of the best kids' games around, with two sizes of magnetic fish, paper to poke holes in and a large fishing rod / poking stick. Haba in top gear.

update dec 2014:
Despite amazing dex element to this game, memory aspect is grating. Will introduce variant that allows to see which holes are already fished I think.

update: we now always use marker on unfished holes made to save wasting turns fishing in old empty holes. Easier to remember where to fish next.

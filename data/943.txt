Owned as Ligretto.  I have two copies, printed to complement each other as they have different backs to accommodate up to 8 players.  Excellent fast game with any number.

I am advised by my niece that this game is also known as Red Dragon.  In Red Dragon normal cards are used, but with different backs.  Players upturned stacks have 13, not 10 cards.  Piles of face up cards in the centre can be claimed by the player placing a King on top (Ace is low), to add to their own card score of those cards played into unfinished piles.

Ligretto is a real-time frantic speed game played with cards.
It is absolutely better with more players, when the chaos is much more, and it doesn't risk to stagnate with everybody waiting for the right cards.
I guess it will be fun to play with the daughters when they'll grow up a little bit.

Fun speed game.  I have played Ligretto & Dutch Blitz.  We also play a version called 'Nertz' with a standard deck of cards.

UPDATE 2014: It's an okay, light-weight, speed game that sometimes really drags if players cannot consistently score enough positive points. I much prefer to play this game online where I don't have to shuffle all the time. Overall, I prefer other speed games to this one.

Have now played this with kids and adults ( but with no more than 3 players) and so far it has played slow.  Once it gets going, it is ok but it seems to start slow.  Possibly with more people and more familiarity with the mechanics it would play better.  I've got it at the ready as a light game that scales up to 8 players but I won't be pushing it any time soon...

You like strategy? This is not your game! You have fast hands and the ability to multi task (watching your piles as well as your opponents)? You'll love this game! A fast paced game that will have you hooked! For the intense dutch blitzers out there, with 8 people try keeping indivudal scores and each round playing with a different partner. Instead of the game ending when someone reaches 100, end the game after a predetermined amount of rounds(a round consisting of each person playing once with every other person).

I went through years of playing this with my wife's side of the family. Lots of people, many long nights with lots of decks of cards around the table. I played it mostly because everyone else was so into it. I never enjoyed the game much, just the company. This can be played just fine with a regular deck of cards. 
One deck each - different backs. Basically speed solitaire. Essentially the same game as Nertz or Ligretto.

Do the Dutch do anything fast?  They must have smaller hands than me.  It is not that I don't like dexterity games.  I just don't like dexterity games that involve having to pick a card up off a table faster than your opponent.  I'm not about to grow out my fingernails to be good at this one either.

This game was once described to me as "Muli-player Solitaire on Meth".  Which is quite true.  I have not been very good at "speed" based games, but I do pretty well with this.  A lot of fun, and very quick.  Best played with 4 people.

Just upped my rating from a "7" to an "8" after a bunch of plays.  An excellent game that plays best with four players.

Revised my rating back down to a "6".  Given my age, and my complete lack of desire in ever playing any speed based game ever again, I do not like this game any more.

Highly recommended for the speed card crowd (Jungle Speed, etc).

Very fun, quick game. Requires quick thinking, not long-planning strategy, so it's a good balance to the heavier games I tend to prefer. There's randomness, but it's balanced by playing many hands. The fact that you can score negatively in a hand means that no lead is unsurmountable.

It's really no fun playing with people of very disparate levels of ability, but the learning curve is shallow enough that this isn't a huge problem.

RATING: 10
If you have exactly four players, this game will give you an unbelievably fun experience. Dutch Blitz is the fastest, most intense, most addictive card game out there. It requires lightning-fast reflexes, the ability to keep track of fifteen things going on at once, and a willingness to slam your hands into your opponents' in order to prevent them from playing their cards. With four experienced players, every round is a blur of action as people frantically slap down cards in the center of the table and rearrange their piles in front of them before someone yells "Blitz!" It can be a bit random and frustrating when your blitz pile is top-heavy with high-point cards, but the ability to think (and play) faster than everyone else will guarantee a win much of the time. 

And this is one game where buying a second deck and marking the backs of the cards can expand this game up to 8 players. For Dutch Blitz, more chaos is definitely more fun. If you're a stick-in-the-mud gamer who likes to ponder every move and carefully plan strategies for victory, stay far away. But for the rest of us, Dutch Blitz is deranged merriment.

[b]Update:[/b] Increased rating from a 9 to a 10. For me, this game hits every sweet spot. It's frantic, fun, easy to explain, and plays quickly. This is by far my favorite card game.

[b]Update #2:[/b] I've played nearly one hundred games with just my fiancée, and it's become one of our go-to 2-player games. It's just as intense with two as with four, although you're slightly more luck-dependent on your starting layout (since there will be fewer options for playing cards during the game).

Dutch Blitz edition.  A commercial variation of the extremely fast paced "Nertz" or "Pounce" (also known as [gameid=14001]) which can be played with a regular deck.  Beware: [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/123872]women[/url] are especially good at high speed games like this!

RATING: 6
A variation of double solitaire.  I like it even though it is a speed game, and I am terrible at speed games.  Light, easy rules.  Only after 20 plays this deck is looking pretty worn.

In Ligretto nothing gets played from your hand or the face down stack onto your personal cards laid out in front of you (3-5 cards depending on the number of players).   For instance in Dutch Blitz, a girl 7 can be played on a boy 8 on the "Post Pile" in front of you (and each sex is in two colors).  In Ligretto there is no girl/boy or similar distinction.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Finally, I know the difference between Ligretto & Dutch Bltz:  For Dutch Blitz all blue & red cards have a boy on them, all green & yellow cards have a little girl on them.  In the Post Pile (your personal row laid out from your Blitz stack of 10 cards)you can play cards from your Wood Pile (the top of the 3 cards you turn over from your hand cards)or the Blitz Pile, in descending order and alternating boys/girls.  

In Ligretto, there is no such distinction and nothing gets played from your hand or the face down stack onto your personal cards laid out in front of you (3-5 cards depending on the number of players). 

Also in Ligretto you can purchase red, blue, green decks.  This means you can play up to 12 people and sort the cards out afterwards more easily because there can be up to 12 different backs.  Frankly, I don't like to play with more than 4 people.  All can easily reach all stacks in the common playing field, more than that can't.

I have a love-hate relationship with speed games in general and Ligretto in particular. I'm terrible and I can't honestly say I like them... still, I'll hardly ever turn down a game. Beware of BSW - you'll face players that finish the game before you even had a good look at your cards.

Fast playing game - another game where speed is everything.  I enjoy this game much more with a large group playing as partners (a group of 8 playing as 4 teams is where I think this game shines).

Rating is for four players.  It's decent with three, but the pace is not fast enough, since the game can stagnate while everyone is looking for the right numbers.

The standard-deck version Nertz/Pounce/Demon is more interesting because it provides some extra options. That game allows players to build on their own face-up cards, a la Klondike.

Ligretto is a simple real-time card game with a strong element of speed/dexterity. There are no turns, and players are making sequences of colored cards. The first one to get rid of their cards wins. I can see this working really well with families and children.

First play last night was 2 player and was great fun.  People talk about how some games feel like multi-player solitaire, and it's for lack of interaction between the players.  This game could also hold that title, but it's tremendously interactive!  Everyone has played Solitaire (the card game) on their computer, perhaps more than most would like to admit, but it makes learning to play this game much easier since it borrows many mechanics from that game.  I think this will only get more fun with more plays, but will need breaks between sessions.
---
Breaks in between sessions?!  This game became quite a little obsession for me and my SO for a while.  Probably the only "real time speed" game that's kept my interest.  It's also fun with 3 and 4 players, but the issue of the card stacks being out of reach for some players can be a very contentious issue.  Fantastic with 2, however.

Hektisches kleines Kartenspiel, welches in geringer Personenzahl oft einfach ins stocken gerät. Selbst wenn man mehrere Decks kombiniert und zu acht spielt, kann es vorkommen, dass die ganze Hektik in Lauern auf die nächste Karte abebbt, da man erst weiterspielen kann, wenn eine bestimmte Karte gespielt worden ist. Außerdem muss man gewährleisten, dass alle Spieler überall halbwegs gut rankommen. Wenn das Spiel hingegen erstmal läuft und man an der Hektik Spaß hat, ist es ein witziger Filler.

Négy lap van előttünk, illetve egy ötödik egy 10-es kupac tetején. Ezeket tudjuk berakni középre növekvő sorrendben, színre színt rakva. Ha nem tudsz rakni, akkor a paklidból 3-at leszámolsz és ez egy hatodik lap amit lerakhatsz. Persze sokszor ez sem elég, ezért újból leszámolsz 3-at, így mindig 6 lap közül választhatsz amit lerakhatsz. 

Az eleje nagyon unalmas, aztán beindul és pörgőssé válik. De engem ez a része is untatott, szerintem érdektelen játék, talán kisebb gyerekeknek bejöhet. Talán...

A classic that plays well in all player counts. It is tense the whole time during a quick round and there are a few different approaches of where you focus your attention at. I like that aspect.

Use decks of regular playing cards (each deck having a unique back) if you want more than 4 players. We call this variant "Pounce".  Remove jokers. The "Pounce" pile has 13 cards. Put four cards (instead of three) next to the Pounce pile to work off of. Play cards from Ace to King by suit. Stacking is done by alternating color, as in Klondike solitaire.

RATING: 5
Looks like "Blink" or "Speed" as I played it is possibly a spin-off of this, though I played "Speed" well before 1995 and I imagine its one of these public domain games that has been around for years and years.  

Both versions are fast fun games where you basically just try to empty your hand as fast as possible, Speed is fun for just 2 players, this is probably better for 3 or 4.  

Speed is really the only element in the game so while its fun it wears out quickly.

I thought this would be a good substitute for Nertz, but for some reason it lacks the nerve-wracking tension that I've felt playing Nertz.  I think it's probably because your personal deck is smaller, and piles only go up to 10, instead of 13 (King).  I would imagine that it's better with more people, but I was still somewhat disappointed.

(Ligretto) It is nice fast game. Real-time! No waiting. 

It is not good to have dry hands ;-) In that case, the cards can be hard to take from table, and you can be slower than opponent.

Currently we played it in 2 and 3. I looking forward to playing it in 4 - that would be much better fun!

In 2 people, we must use "home rules" - when nobody has anything in hand, let's move one card from front to back in hand.

There can be also a deadlock, when all 1's are in Ligretto stack. But it didn't happen to us yet.

Played only on BSW. Somewhere between an activity and a proper game. there are little tricks to playing, and okay player interaction, but about half of the game is just being able to process what is coming up as you flip through the deck as quickly as possible.

"Dutch Blitz."  >> My side of the family passed along this gem.  Growing up, this was the filler of choice!  Not much strategy here, but the sharpest eyes and fastest hands will prevail.  A single game lasts about 10 minutes, so even a serious strategy gamer can handle a couple of rounds without getting bored.

One of the best card games there is when playing with 4 players. So much fun, so much tension, so stressful. Just a great game. We do play with a mulligan rule, where you are allowed a starting redeal, but you then must add one card to your starting blitz pile.

This is a mess but people enjoy it. Turn cards frantically and try to get rid of your cards as quickly as you can. I was expecting more when I played it the first time, don't ask what I thought it would be like. But people asked to play again...and again. It is over in 10 min tops, so there is that at least. Not a favourite but actually good fun with 4 to 6 people. More would just be too crazy.

Based on some plays online at BSW, I don't know about the cardboard version.

Too fast and mindless for me. It reminds me of those videogames where you have to push buttons crazily fast following the images on the screen.
I like games where you must be fast to win (Blitz chess, Set) but there must be some thinking. This seem just a competition in an acquired mechanical skill.

This is a game that I grew up with. As a Mennonite with Pennsylvania Dutch background, I've always been proud of this game. The skills that make a person good at this game are completely different than those needed for most conventional games. This makes it really interesting to see who turns out to be good at it. In my experience, women seem to be, on average, better than men. Of course you can also get better at it with practice.

Great fun and it's a really fast game. Some luck in the way the cards distribute, but fast practiced players will always shine over the long run. Ligretto is especially great cause it can play such a wide play count.

"Serious" players will probably want to rotate seats on an oblong table to share the middle position advantage (more piles within close reach).

I like this reaction game more than Jungle Speed. Especially with 4 players, this game can be a thriller! The nerves run through your body as the others yell 'Ligretto!

Very fun to play, but don't play this before going to bed or you will have nightmares!

Every player gets their own marked deck of 40 cards. Each deck has 4 suits (blue, green, yellow, red) numbered 1 through 10.  Players create three columns of single cards face up, then another column ("Blitz"pile) of 10 cards. Players then play cards into the middle, matching cards in suit and going up in sequence. Like solitaire, plays can shuffle through three cards of their remaining deck to play cards, or reduce their 10 card column. First player to get rid of their 10 card column yells "Blitz" and the round is over. Score single points for cards played in the middle, minus two points per card left in their Blitz pile. First one to 75 wins. 

It's a fun party game, lots of luck, speed required, and you may damage cards when rushing to put them in the middle.

Funny story: I learned this game (and subsequently got a copy of it) from a German friend of mine, under the name Ligretto.

Fast forward about 5 years: I'm working at a board game store, and the manager and I are going through everything in the store so she can teach me about games I haven't played. We get to Dutch Blitz, which I tell her I've never played. She describes it and we move on.

I *never put together* that they were the same game until my g/f tried to add this to her collection here on BGG. I feel like a dork.

The rule of taking 3 cards at a time is really dumb.

We played this game as Nerts for years using regular playing cards.  It's a fun little speed card flipping and slapping game.  We would play in groups of up to 8, but 4 is really the perfect number.  This game is an 8 or 9 with my college friends; I just don't play with a large variety of people these days.

One complaint--it is often hard to quickly distinguish the numbers on the blue and green cards.  They should have used all lighter colors.

We had a blast playing this. Even though I was beating all the rest of the family, they were still very interested in playing. The mechanic of keeping everybody involved makes for a really entertaining game. The cards are really flimsy, and for such a rough treatment I think they will not last long. I am definitely sleeving this. I have two boxes and I think that is plenty. I can't imagine more than 6 people playing this at once without crashing onto each other constantly. I am pretty sure this game will be a great filler and something we play on weekdays where time or inclination does not favor heavier games.

Ugh, I really loathe this game... because I'm so bad at it! Nonetheless, Dutch Blitz is a terrific speed game that requires quick recognition, fast hands, and the ability to think on the fly.

My wife and kids love this one and they are vastly superior at it compared to me. Whenever we play as a family, I watch with amused despair as they run the table while I languish in negative points. I don't know why, but they are much faster at this game than I am. It's still fun to play, though; I honestly get a kick out of my family doing so well at a game. The astounding irony is that I'm the big game geek. :)

I loathe Ligretto. Doesn't really do it for me. Just seems like a slightly more complicated version of the public domain game Spit. I've only palyed it on BSW, so maybe it's me... I'd take Spit any day.

We owe both red and blue. I'm not a big fan of action games. As with most other games, with the right group of players, this can be fun. It doesn't suffer from over-analysys.

RATING: 6.2
Este é um jogo estranho, mas, claro, pelo menos dá para variar um pouco... Com uma dose sobrenatural de oportunismo e outra ainda maior de sorte, Ligretto é um jogo para gente com bons reflexos e muita capacidade de análise, para que a vitória lhes sorria na selva que será a mesa de jogo. Não é para mim, mas sei de gente que gosta mesmo deste tipo de chachada!

An excellent speed game. Easy to teach and a joy to play. A family favorite and I've also had the good fortune to play a full-contact team-based version in a gymnasium with 4-foot cards - occasionally painful but always hilarious. Dutch Blitz / Ligretto is definitely the sleeper hit of my collection.

A fun real time game. There's a lot of luck to it, if your stacks have a lot of 8,9,10's showing it's going to be a tough round, but I suppose that's balanced out a bit by games being to 75 points, which is probably at least 6 rounds of play. There's also a skill to this game, the more aware you are of your opponents actions the more you'll be rewarded, and of course, the faster you are both physically and mentally, the better.

Fun filler from my childhood. My favourite speed game. Next to chess, I've probably played this more than anything else. We played it for endless hours as children. I also worked in an office for several years where this was brought out every lunch hour and everyone played. It was a lot of fun. We used to also play a human-sized variant in a gym with teams using home-made cards that were about 3 feet tall. Some painful games, but very fun.

I was introduced to this one back in 2003, and it really is a blast.  By far the best speed game I have played, it might take playing it with family to get the most enjoyment out of it, but in itself for such an old game I think it stands up quite well as a true classic.  But don't be fooled, this is NOT a 2-player game or even a 3-player game.  Play it with 4 (or more with another set).

RATING: 7
A fun speed game, pretty much like a multi-player version of the classic card game Solitaire. The appeal here is simple rules and fast and furious game play. The only issue is that sometimes the game can stall where nothing can be played, and it seems that people can accumulate negative points. A good house rule is to play an agreed number of hands rather than going until a particular score is reached.

Perhaps it's the Dutch blood in me, or my love for all things Anabaptist, but I tend to agree with the assessment on the front of the box, that it is "A vonderful goot game".  This is definitely my kind of card game - fast, furious, and marginally violent (surprising considering its popularity with the Mennonites - although the fact remains that I have seen blood drawn while playing this game, especially when opponents don't keep their fingernails neatly trimmed).  It is one that requires speed, lightning reflexes, concentration, and the ability to watch several things at once.  Therefore, it is not recommended if you're tired at the end of a long day and looking for a nice, relaxing game with which to unwind.  And while it can be played with 2-4 players (or more if you have more decks), the optimal number is definitely 4.  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 6.5/10

RATING: 7
Fast paced set building game played in real time. Not much out of the ordinary here but it is quick and fun so a definite win on that front. The big down side for me is the fact that you can get pretty stuck if the draw on your deck isn't producing anything and sometimes between you and your opponents it can take a while of nothing happening before it gets moving again. I personally prefer the dice version of this but maybe that's just because I like dice.

Almost entirely luck based - a set of 10s as your top 4 cards will basically handicap you for the entire hand, but there is almost enough going on to make up for this.

It essentially is a very luck heavy dexterity game (the speed at which you put your cards on to piles makes a real difference to the eventual winner).

Not really for me.

Not bad... but we found ourselves without any plays available too often and sitting watching other people wasn't much fun.  If I'm going to play this kind of game I'd *much* rather play Blink.

Waaaaaaaay too long if played to 75 points. 
Really, it's kind of a dull speed game.

Villámgyors, realtime kártyajáték gyerekeknek, melyben folyamatosan (szinte már kapkodva) kell kijátszanunk a kártyáinkat. Elsősorban ez is kisebbeknek, de itt valós az életkor-megkötés, hiszen a számok gyors felismerése és a lapok leszámolása is elengedhetetlen.

Frenzied frantic fun. But not a game so much as an activity.

Haven't got enough stress with your job, kids or whatever? Play Dutch Blitz or "Ligretto" how it's called in german. Beware of players with long fingernails :)

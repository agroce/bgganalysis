I loved this game as a teenager, but the complexity of it meant it rarely got played. I sold it years ago, and remember regretting it almost immediately. I doubt I would enjoy it as much now, with greater experience of civilisation building games, so I'm happy to simply remember it fondly.

RATING: 5
This game just seems to have missed the mark in a really sad way. It's lovely to look at - really, really appealing. And the theme of exploration and empire building is a marvel in itself. But the totally crazy luck element and plodding table-lookup mechanic lets it down hugely. I once played it as a Warhammer campaign engine (like it is supposed to be played) but it just seemed like more of a chore than a game and whoever got the best dice rolls on events/discoveries had a massive head start. Still, I can't part with it!

It's a good campaign generator for Warhammer battles. As a game per se, it's nothing that should be remembered in the hall of fame of the Geek...

RATING: 6
Although the theme is -really- great, the rules are a bit simple and not really original. Too much happens on paper instead of on the board. When combined with 'warhammer fantasy battle' this game can be intriguing. Don't know why I ever sold this game!

Unfortunately on 26-11-2009, BGG were instructed to remove all uploaded files all all GW games. Even those files with no copyrite material.

Wow! Another theme-rich, lavishly produced, and fun fantasy boardgame by games workshop. Intended primarily as a battle-generator for Warhammer Fantasy battles/campains, Mighty Empires almost scratched that Divine Right itch of strategic-level fantasy wargame. If only it had heroic leaders and characters! The engenious geomorphic hex tiles made made the mapboard different and novel every time. Another excellent club game.

I like the ideas better than the execution. Never managed to finish a campaign - and there aren't enough village/castle/fortress component pieces, meaning Empires can end up with swathes of empty land between them.

I liked this for playing long campaigns. But as they are so long, I'd ditch the board and draw out a scaled down hex map with pins to locate your armies. Otherwise you will have to use a lot of space for a very long time!

RATING: 4
Maybe I am being unfair as we only got a third of the way into the game and abandoned it after four hours. As a stand alone game not using it for a campaign there is little to recommend it. It is horrendously imbalanced. We quickly realised it is cheaper to buy troops and not feed them than to buy baggage (food). It is nice that a conquest game has so much detail but ultimately it is all just roll a dice consult a table in this game. There is no shortage of better conquest games. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I liked this game as it was written, but also to use as a campaign system for tabletop wargames.  You can 'zoom' in on a conflict in a hex with your favorite mini's rules, then take the result to M.E. or if you want to move the campaign along faster, you'd just use the quick resolution in the M.E. rules.

As a game on its own Mighty Empires functions much more effectively then as a campaign system, in my opinion. Map-based campaigns always tend to disintegrate over time, especially when you have more than two players.

In the end, this game was never about the game or the campaign... it was about the cool pieces!

Never played it and never will play it. I kept it all this time because of the beautiful parts. 

The armies and combat system are very dissapointing (just numbers), unless played with Warhammer (which makes it a very, very long game).

Campaign game where players nuture their empires and attempt to grow them.  It could be used as a campaign set where the battles could be fought using any form of miniatures rules.  Long game, but played cleanly and was good fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The game has some issues, length, component usability (bumping and shifting tiles are so annoying). But it is one of the few complete epic kingdom building games where you need to consider where your troops will hole up during the winter, conduct spying and espionage missions, making sure you have supply lies to your front lines. There is so much and it is so involved, and because of that it'll likely never be played by me again. This is something that fits the lifestyle of a high school student who is able to stay up until the wee hours of the morning on an overnight stay. And even when I was in that phase, I never made the game to completion.

SOLD IT!

The one and only time my parents ever got me a board game (when clearly that was the one thing I was most jazzed about), this is what the people at the game store convinced them to get. Sadly, having no interest in miniatures or Warhammer, this never got any play. I tried to make use of it, but by itslef there isn't much you can do, other than use the cool minis for making new games.

An awesome strategic overlay for Warhammer Fantasy Battle, quite playable all by itself.  I REALLY enjoy this game.  So much so that I bought two sets and combined them into one large six player world.  (And printed up extra sea tiles, and acquired all the White Dwarf articles and so on.)  Too bad nobody will play it with me much due to length.  I&#039;ve NEVER played it WITH WHFB though which is a lifelong dream I&#039;ll never live out.  =(

As a strategy game, Mighty Empires is a bit too luck based and can become rather unbalanced (some of the winterevents might turn out very well or very bad). But that is of course part of the game and fits nicely into the fantasy theme. Anyway, succesfully casting a nasty spell during one of the equinoxes can be quite fun. Although the dragons should perhaps appear a bit more often ... We never actually finished a game, even after playing more than 15 hours (usually something like three campaign seasons - four or five players, two boxes) and that is the major disadvantage of this game. It simply lasts too long for what it is.

This one is just so ... GW! The rules are a really cool read and you can't wait to start, but then it drags on forever. We had two sets that we used to combine with WHFB, but then the game usually broke down into a tedious bookkeeping exercise. Plus, the battles it generated for Warhammer were not that interesting, after all, because most of them were totally unbalanced. So you have to use the quick resolution for most of them anyway. Overall, it was a bit like playing second edition Blood Bowl with the tournament rules: your mighty star player broke his leg (or skull or ...) and you would have to put up with the consequences for the rest of the season. Substitute champion for star player and you can imagine how much fun such a battle was, as most Warhammer battles are seldom (read: never) decided by those subtleties. Damn, it just sounded so COOOL!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Typical 80's dicefest which is raised out of obscurity thanks to the dazzling sense of scale it creates and an early use of a board made of modular hexagons. One of the rare games that really makes you feel as though you're commanding the fate of an empire, even though that fate would often come down to luck with the dice. Can be used as a campaign system for Warhammer although just thinking about the length of time that would take makes me feel slightly dizzy.

I loved the concept of this game.  Only every played it as intended once, with the Warhammer FB armies and battles, and we never finished the campaign.  But we played it as is quite a few times.  It always seemed to come down to winter diplomacy rather than outright battling, and tons of winter assassins whittling away armies whilst they holed up in their cities.

Enjoyed discovering new tiles and even conquering barren lands and seeing huge armies spreading out, but ultimately, it was taking up space in my wardrobe and very recently had to make its way into eBay heaven and the afterlife.

Game play is relatively poor and wonky. There are some neat elements of the game, but luck is overly significant in this game of discovery and battle. Too closely tied to WFB to be a good game on its own, the components are excellent and worth stealing and using for other games. Like the idea of the campaign season, the flavor of magic, the strategy cards and the use of spies and assassins, but in execution each of these fails somewhat.

Tengo que valorarlo con un 10! El juego es una joya para dirigir campañas de warhammer , armies of arcana o cualquier wargame. Así que hay que valorarlo como eso, no es para jugarlo en 2 horas ni 4, sino para tenerlo montado y llevar una campaña a lo largo de meses. Facilmente adaptable con reglas de la casa que se nos ocurran. La mejor combinación son los hexagonos de plástico que sacacó GW hace unos años con las reglas de esta versión Old School (circula el pdf por internet).

A rare thing from a company legendary for its endless milking of cows: a game of battling fantasy creatures you could play right out of the box. Mind you, this came to the world a good 15 years before Descent and their ilk were ever committed to the drawing board. I'd say there's a great likelihood those more recent "explore the hexes and fight enemies" games have shown the world better mechanics with less rules. But my first and only Mighty Empires play was a blast from start to end. Maybe fond memories are clogging my reasoning?

I'd love to give this a higher rating, but the rules are excessive & the game takes a long time to play for what it is.

This is less a game than a "toolkit" which can be used as a long campaign's tracking device. I use this with lots of miniature games, but the best is Wastelands 3: Total Meltdown, a post-apoc skirmish wargame that has a persistent universe and rules for campaigns.

As an early campaign system for Warhammer, this game is well thought out and put together.  On it's own...  not so much.  I don't think they ever intended for this guy to stand on it's own feet.  Pick it up as a Warhammer nut, otherwise stay away.

As a standalone game this is definetly bad choice. It may work as battle setup for warhammer but alone - make up your own rules, it may well be worth of it. It has all right castles, cities and village figures and map but everything else...

Sold it out.

One of the best strategic level wargames I have played (In 30 years I have played many). Too bad GW dropped the game. Very expandable and adaptable.

Had it in he 90s. On one evening me and some friends painted all the miniatures, but it remained unplayed.
Gave it away a couple of years ago and at least it's being in use for W40K adventures now.

As a stand alone game its not great.  As a way to have a warhammer campaign game, I suppose it could be ok, if you've got a couple of months to spare.  But the pieces are fantastic.

Excellent components that could well be used in other games (e.g. War of the Ring). The rules could use some polishing, but as a strategic layer for Mini Wargaming this is excellent.

I'm looking for a copy of the all of the expansion rules from White Dwarf.

Another GW game that had great potential if they didn't try to keep expanding it into their campaign series.  The pieces (towns, cities, and fortresses) are great to use with Nexus War of the Ring.

Excellent grand strategy game. Spent years playing campaigns using war hammer battles at our club every Sunday as kids. Also had another set to play the basic game at home. Brilliant.

very nice Game parts for general use:
Fortress, city, village, ships

A highly random take on empire building and an entertaining way to spend a day. Too flawed to be used as the basis of a Warhammer Fantasy Battle campaign, but good on its own (and better with the expanded rules from the White Dwarf and Citadel Journal magazines).

RATING: 6
Quite fun as a wargame in it's own right, although the limitation to three players is a nuisance if you want to play a larger game.  As a campaign engine for Warhammer Fantasy Battle it's not very practical, as you'd need to leave the board set up for *months* while the campaign takes it's course.  After all, a large WHFB game can easily take all day.

I primarily used this game as a bridge for WFB campaigns, but it felt it lacked something to make it a good stand alone game

We liked this SO much and we played it a zillion of times. 

It's time we take this out again!

We have the game two times in our collection and we have several extra mini's!

Such a great game!

Pretty good game in itself, but when combined with WHFB or Warmaster this game shows it's claws. With Warmaster rating would be probably 9.

[3][i]GW game. The game isn't annoying, but the publisher is, to a degree that I will not play or support their products. Orginally rated this a 6, but GW just sucks the fun out of playing their games. Original comment:[/i]
Would like to play this as a Warhammer campaign but think that will never happen. 3 players max is a handicap for this game, in my opinion, but the concept is great

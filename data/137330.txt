Extra quick, extra fun, can't recommend it enough. This is a silly game with the objective of flicking cubes and knocking off board the opponent's pieces, each cube represents an army unit and there are different types/abilities for each unit type, it can finish very very quickly and so you can play it multiple times over an hour, it is a smashing hit at home!

RATING: 7.75
Waiting on replacement mats.  I suggest that you not buy this until the reprint comes out later this year -- the square box means folded mats that tend to have huge creases right in the middle.  Luckily Gamewright is a great company and offered replacement without question or even proof of purchase.

The game itself is a quick fix of silly fun.  Setting up in secret, though only mentioned as a variant in the rules, makes for a hilarious moment of reveal when you see the absurd piles of dice your opponent has erected.

We didn't try building any armies, but I appreciate the variety introduced by the special cubes.  I'm very excited for the replacement mats to come so we can play in earnest.

RATING: 3
Rarely I've been disappointed by a game. I was so exited about it that I even bought two of them. And boy was I disappointed.
The game is fun, much fun, in fact. However, if there is a game that is affected by the quality of the components this is it:
* The maps came folded inside the box and the creases look horrible and affect game play a lot. This could be easily avoided if the box was longer and narrower, allowing the maps to be rolled rather than folded. 
* The cubes are very light weight and two of mine are not assembled properly so the cubes are misshapen, again affecting game play.
I spend half an hour ironing the board (using a cloth to protect them), and now they are tightly rolled. I will see if that helped tomorrow.

Incredibly fun game. Played the designer twice at Games Expo 2011. Lost the first game by miles but a surprisingly lucky shot in game 2 took Oli's Kingbrick off the board and gave me the win. I'm not sure who was surprised more, me or him!

Of course, it was only right that I grab a handmade copy straight away!

UPDATE: Since my first comments on this game, my son is two years older and Gamewright has replaced my rippled mats. If you have the first edition with one big mat folded in the box, contact the publisher now and get that mat replaced with the new three piece mat set they put in their second edition. It improves the game a considerable amount. My score remains the same, but I can say that the older my son gets, the more challenging it is to play it with him. Great dexterity game made just a little bit strategic with the abilities of some of the dice.

OLD: This is a GREAT game!  I played it with it's simplest rules with my 5 year old son and had a blast and then played another 8 games back to back with my 13 year old daughter a little more competitively and it was the same level of absolute laugh out loud fun.  The game moves a long very quickly.  And when you get that insanely lucky shot, if you are playing with the right person, it's time to jump up and down screaming about how cool it was like a total lunatic.  This is a game that will come down frequently with my kids.  I would easily call it good for ages 5 and up.

We had a decent time flicking cubes around the board.  It was entertaining, but I can't see owning this or wanting to play it much. The board is a roll up and had big crises in it. That's a problem for a dexterity game.

I and my brothers used to line up plastic soildiers on either side of the hallway at home. Then we'd roll a stell ball at each others' team. Sometimes we'd build fortresses of Duplos too. The Duplo bricks are not made to collide with a steel ball, so we ruined many of them.

Cube Quest reminds me of those days and I know we'll have a blast playing it.

My brother has it, and is expecting a second copy soon as the mats were damaged in the first print. I'm hoping he'll let me salvage the old one.

This has been a huge hit with my boys, ages 8 and 6.  They love playing against me, and play against each other too.  It's quick (5-10 min), so we can play several games in one sitting, and it's just plain fun to flick those cubes and smack your opponent's carefully placed cubes off the board.  I rate this a "must have" if you have boys age 6-10.  

I doubt I would play Cube Quest with adults, at least not too often.  Maybe a game or two.  There's not quite enough there, even with team building, to keep me occupied.  But it really, really shines with kids.

RATING: 6
This game is ONLY fun once you start building your own armies, in secret. Honestly... the reveal is sort of the most fun part of this game.

This is also a game that becomes more fun as you play it with the same person, as you start to anticipate what the other person will build and try to outsmart them.

The actual dexterity component, I feel, is lacking. The dice are unpleasantly light, for one. And half the game is spent picking pieces up off the floor. The game is fun enough and engaging while you're playing it (maybe not a great feat for a 5-10 minute game) but it's hard to recommend this game over the many other dexterity games in my repertoire. It seems to have been designed to fill what is perhaps TOO specific of a niche.

Also the number 1 reason I wouldn't recommend this to a friend? The game is unplayable out of the box. I mean, literally, the mats are four times the size of the box and come folded - ours were creased such that the game was unplayable. Why was this not in a tube? GameWright will send free replacements in a tube, but this isn't the sort of thing I should have HAD to do. I bought a game, then couldn't play it for the 3 weeks it took for the replacement mats to arrive, and now I can't store the mat and the game together unless I create my own custom storage. It's such an obvious flaw, it's stunning.

If you don't mind having to wait for replacement mats, and are looking for a short, light, dex game to play with the same partner over and over then this'll do you. Otherwise you're probably better served looking elsewhere.

Fun! Dice falling off of the table is the only complaint, but that has nothing to do with this game. The powers are fun, the tension is fun, and building a different team each time is fun (or rolling a random team!).

Play in a room where dice flying all over the place makes them easy to pick up though. No couches that are hard to reach under and no garbage cans nearby.

--- Update

Updated to 10. This game is so unique. A mess to play, but that's not at all their fault. It's just too fun strategically flicking dice to take out other dice, and the competition is goodhearted in that we are impressed when either player makes a nice shot.

Simple dexterity game with very nice mousepad "boards" and relatively light dice.  Players choose a 40 point army from cubes/dice depicting units with varying special abilities and ultimately try to knock their opponent's king off the board.

For a dumb game about flicking cubes at each other there are a surprising amount of strategic approaches.

Unplayable out of the box, the mats are so bent and creased. Bought this one knowing full well the play mats would be creased and the stickers on the dice would be off center. Mats aren't just a little creased, they are totally bent. 

*Update: Thanks to the designer and publisher for replacing my first edition copy with the second edition. It totally fixes the production problems with the game. The mat comes in three ROLLED sections, not two folded ones. A perfect 10 for customer service and correcting mistakes.

A simple dice-flicking game, fast play, no rules to be bogged down by. The only complaint I have is that the special powers included with the base game are not exactly exciting to play with.

Just taking a prebuilt army each and battling it out is great fun, though.

There are definitely a few things about Cube Quest that will annoy a certain type of gamer, the less than billiard table flat playing surface, the wonky stickers on some cubes (a small price to pay if the alternative is having to apply them all by hand), ambiguities concerning flicking, pushing and nudging and the lack of rules to limit deployment formations. Despite how carefully you arrange you troops the game can be over in one lucky shot which will make you either say ‘ I never want to play again’ or more commonly “just one more go’. The game also has real nostalgia value, I bet that any schoolboy with a smidgeon of imagination will have made up and played some variant of Cube Quest using their own improvised units and rules. So, relive those more simple times and put aside any niggles, there is no denying that the game is FUN and at the end of the day that is all that matters.

Im a fan of dexterity games and this one is a blast! 
There are some flaws in that the rules are a bit TOO open ended...some set ups ("trains") are too powerful, and at times its hard to tell a 'flick' from a 'push'. 

Houserules against trains are pretty much mandatory here. 

The mat that comes with this is also very difficult to fully flatten.

Despite the rompy feel, I'm pretty sure this game is better when played with finesse-- if you flick cubes lightly, they don't fly off the board and you can even sometimes prevent them from tumbling.

The boardgame-equivalent to one on one fighting games, here you can have a whole group of people in one room, duelling each other by having the victorious player of one matchup pass to the next one waiting in line. A game takes about two minutes, is immensly fun and I'm very surprised that I haven't lost a single die yet.

I’m astonished no one thought of this before now. We could have all been playing Cube Quest instead of The Princes of Florence, but no, Wolfgang Kramer said [i]Good god what if Renaissance patrons had buku money but not enough space for their outbuildings[/i] and that’s how we got where we are today.

I [thing=73171]almost[/thing] don’t play miniatures, and I’m [thing=22897]almost[/thing] [thing=13240]not[/thing] [thing=21706]tempted[/thing] by miniatures, but Cube Quest is miniatures for the rest of us. You buy up an army, stack them like cordwood if you’re like my regular play partner, and kick them to kingdom come. We play this on the floor ever since my wife kicked a unit into the everlasting hereafter (since found).

The mats issue is a big one, and the longer the game goes since its release the less I can recommend it: I bought a second copy months later and the folding is much, much worse, I assume from sitting on the shelf longer. This game cries out for a rerelease in a tube. It also cries out for additional units, and bigger mats, and larger armies. It is miniatures for the skint at heart, and I am all for it.[color=#ffffff]a9Z4MnAx[/color]

Neat 2p dexterity game, like someone hit Crossbows & Catapults with a shrink ray and then gently waved the rulebook of a miniatures game over it.  

If the cubes were less light and bouncy the game would have less scrambling to retreive them from under furniture.  Or maybe this is supposed to be played on a carpet on one's stomach.

RATING: 8
"Let's flick dice at each other!" -- one of those games where it's hard to believe no one thought of this before. Surprisingly fun for how simple it is. And the cubes are actually physically lighter than typical dice, which, somewhat counterintuitively, seems to help the game. Plays super-quick. 

[b]Update:[/b] I bought the first edition of this, in which the mats had to be folded and then were lumpy as a result. I emailed Gamewright for the replacement mats and they sent them out right quick. Awesome of them, and very nice to have smooth mats.

The most fun two people can have playing a game. Very simple and easy to learn, it plays very quickly and provides laughs galore. Its essentially just flicking cubes about so can't justify top marks, but this is as good as light dexterity games come.

A really fun idea for a game that is hampered by physical faults. The play mat is creased and will not lay flat. The "dice" are really just hollow plastic cubes that are prone to breaking apart and are too light. If physical issues were fixed, this would be a great little game.

Where did this even come from?? The company that made those quirky games your parents bought when you were growing up made a fantastic filler game. Build up your "fort" of dice and knock over your opponents with the end goal being that you want to bump off your opponents "King".  The dice differ in abilities as well when building your fort, some don't get eliminated as easily, some freeze other dice, some heal. Lots of replayability, the one who wins isn't always the one who has best dexterity. Great fun by everyone. FYI; if your game mat is wrinkled because it was folded in your box contact the company they will send you out a replacement set of matts for free.

RATING: N/A
Terrible production oversight on the first edition here - someone must have noticed along the way that those playmats were too big for the box and yet they chose to release the product anyway. Result? The playmats get junked up from being folded in the box and the game becomes unplayable.
To Gamewright's credit, they have astounding customer service when it comes to this issue. I told them I acquired a used copy of the game that was unplayable for the reasons stated above - they answered by sending me a new copy of the revised edition. Granted, the box on the 2nd edition still isn't big enough for the new playmats...but still, I was impressed with how they handled my complaint.

Rated as a Family/Childs game. 

Cube Quest is a dexterity game in which cubes (lightweight hollow dice) are finger flicked across custom rubber mats. Cubes that leave the mats are defeated. Play alternates until someone wins by defeating the enemy king.
Cubes also risk defeat in enemy territory. If they land 'shadow' face up they have been captured and must be rolled, like dice, to determine if they escape.

The play mats were so bent and warped from the packaging that the game was unplayable.  This is depressing as it looks to be an enjoyable game.  

I sent an e-mail to the manufacturer, who replaced the mats.  But now they are too large to store in the box.

No rush to buy this game (although it looks fun as heck). Perhaps wait until they resolve the folded mat and light-weight dice issue. Until then, Mutant tiddly wink game and pitchcar/crockinole can be played to get the flicking itch scratched.

That being said, it appears that Gamewright's customer service is stepping up to the plate and resolving the folded mat problem. This also seems to be the case with the dice that are misaligned.

RATING: 9
Played 3 games in quick succession on unboxing and was really good fun, and worked out fine playing as two teams of two. Made me reminisce about crossbows and catapults. Slightly disappointed with the weight of the cubes, since the original Kingbrick used heavier wooden blocks (if memory from UK Expo is correct) but it occurred to us that it may be possible to adjust this quite easily - the cubes have removable sides and are hollow, so the cavity could be filled with something like blu-tac to give them a bit more weight. There would even be options for variable weights between different piece types, if centering isn't too much of a problem... obviously I will never actually get round to experimenting with this. Great fun in its original form nonetheless. We have wondered whether house-rules such as being obliged to flick with thumb and little finger would help to reduce power and increase strategy a bit, but haven't tried this yet.

This definitely fills a niche in my collection - quick playing dexterity game.  

I'll admit I don't have much experience with dexterity games.  I've only played a few practice rounds of PitchCar before I decided to trade it away because it wasn't fun enough.  I've mostly written off other dexterity games because of this.  However, I was hooked from the first flick in Cube Quest.  This is going to make an excellent filler while waiting for other games to finish up at game night.  There is some light strategy with how to draft your army, what formations to use, and trying to position your cubes with each flick, but a game is over in 5 minutes so it doesn't overstay its welcome.  Really want multiplayer options, more units, maybe different mats with areas that offer bonuses or penalties.

[b] I was a bit disappointed by this after my initial plays. Subsequent plays went better, but it still seems that how you put together your team and how you set it up matters less than brute flicking force, which is a pity.
Components-wise I wonder how long the stickered dice will stay stickered. And the play mats smelled horribly - I had to air them out for two weeks before I could stand being in the same room with them.[/b]

As someone who used to make and flick many paper footballs in school, this game spoke to me. It said, "I am not someone who used to flick many paper footballs in school, but you are. C'mon, buy me, you'll like me." Guess what? It was right.

Okay, so what's really goin' on here? You're building defensive formations and trying to knock your enemy king off its board. There are 3 boards - one for you, one for them, and one in the middle to make larger battlefields. The 'boards' are actually like large mouse mats, and considering the price of any decent-size mouse mat, this game is worth it just for those.

This game requires one to skillfully balance strategy, grace and power. Every part of the game, from building to attacking to placing Skulks and defeating enemies, has the attractor-like behavior of a massive interactive system. Every play counts and there are no dull moments. It has all the best things about bowling, football and golf, scaled down to the tabletop.

This would easily get an 8 if there was a cheap expansion that gave the game even more depth - perhaps some placeable formations? Until that time, I just fool around with placing props on the mats.

2 factors come into play when evaluating dexterity games:  the compulsion to play "just one more" and the number of times this cycle repeats before the spell is broken.  Cube Quest is designed to excel on both stages and it comes down to the tension between players "building" their side of the board both physically through deployment and mechanically through unit selection in opposition to the ability of a fantastic shot from across the board to end the game in a flash.  The investment of making something mentally and pitting that something against the physical skill of your opponent is the magic.

Gyors, pörgős pöckölgetős játék, ahol a különböző képességek és a variálható kezdő felállás némi taktikát is visz a játékba.
Aztán játék közben már csak az ügyességen múlik minden (ill. bénázáson.. :P), de nekem valahogy sosem sikerül amit szeretnék. :D Ez persze marha vicces helyzeteket szül, remekül lehet szórakozni egymáson. Ilyen tekintetben csapatban még jobb játszani, mert lehet egymást szidni. :)
Egy valami bosszant, de nagyon: a kockák össze-vissza repülnek.. Ez számomra sokat levon az élvezeti értékből sajnos. Kéne szereznem egy menő társasos asztalt (peremmel), az sokat javítana a helyzeten. Mindezek mellett a játékmenet annyira nem különleges, hogy ez legyen a választás pl a Stiga hokival szemben.. (Bár ha előkerül, akkor akár órákat is játszunk vele egymás után).

Video Review - https://youtu.be/UtOsA3M8SrY

Cube Quest is a two player game that is a lot of fun. Easy to grasp and quick to set up and play. Both players take their cubes and set up a structure with them to protect their king cube. They can do this however they want. Then when players are happy they take turns flicking a cube at the oppositions cubes to knock the King cube off the matt. There are more advance rules but as I tend to play with my 6 year old I rarely use them.

I admit I enjoy a very few select dexterity game, but for me, Cube Dice is just another dice flicking game. The background and the mat add some colour to it, but at the end of the day, once you are past the "excitement" of the first couple of games, all this adds nothing gaming-wise, except setup time.

I prefer [thing=16747][/thing] a hundred times.

The ultimate in dexterity games? Quite possibly. A direct cross between Tumblin-Dice and Crossbows & Catapults, this has been the surprise find of the year for me. A big hit at the UK Games Expo 2011, the quality isn't at all bad for a home-made operation (note, I still own the original 'KingBrick' prototype): good sturdy felt-covered board and stickers that remain firmly adhered to the cubes.

Further Thoughts: On my birthday game (the fifth game, actually), I hit a perfect curling shot which took out my opponent's well-guarded King like David Bryant taking out a jack. There's no other game that's made me feel so awesome for a long time. Upgraded into my top ten, at least for the time being.

Heard about this on The Dice Tower. Picked up for $20 on Amazon. Excellent purchase, my 10-year old loves it, and I enjoy playing it with him. Might be good for a lark now and then with an adult, but this is really aimed at the Toys-R-Us crowd, and that's not a bad thing. There have been a number of "stand-up-die-flicks", and plenty of laughs and growns to make this a great investment - and I will strongly consider this as a "gift game" for the non-hobby-gamer kids and families we know. Could be a great entry-point for them into other, non-deterity games.

The original KingBrick version seemed really popular at UK Games Expo 2011. I like the occasional flicky dexterity game, but I tried this twice and just didn't see what the fuss was about - maybe I just hadn't had enough beer yet. 

Update: Tried the new Cube Quest version at UK Games Expo 2013 and enjoyed it more - partly because the higher production quality really helps but I think it's also very mood-dependent and I was more receptive to it this time. But I still much prefer more "serious" flicky games like Crokinole.

(25+ plays) Elegant and exciting, quick and dramatic.  I suspect this game really captures the designers intent.  Lots of fist pumping and cheering and "NOOOOOOOOO!"  Box says 15 minutes, but our games have been closer to 5 minutes.  Fun.

My wife kicks my but at this. Lost of fun, and a really silly game. My only concern is that the dice will not withstand a lot of abuse, so I will lacquer them to make them last a bit more.

RATING: 8
Cube-flicking dexterity game that brings back memories of playing Crossbows & Catapults. Various cubes have different abilities, and rules for building an army should keep this fresh.

Components would have been ok, BUT...
- the mats were folded to fit into the box and now have creases in them which affects how the cubes move when flicked across the surface
- some of the stickers on the cubes themselves weren't aligned properly, and others had fluff on them (had to trim & re-glue quite a few stickers)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's ok. Even as a kid's game it isn't much more than that.

The packaging isn't great also. The mat is folded pretty tight, so there is a high probability that there will be a ridge in the mat. I've seen the exact same thing in review videos, so I know I am not alone.

J and I played this when she was tired. i brought this game out as a way to squeak out one more game! tee-hee

I do like the concept, but it was way too messy and we ended up losing cubes under the couch, TV stand, etc... 

Verdict:
It was fun but too messy for our living room. I prefer crokinole for this reason. We may try playing on a crokinole board to see if that helps.

Love the concept but the exceptionally light dice and the warped playing surfaces provided (think giant mousepads that have been folded up in a box) limited the fun on our initial plays...  Trying to flatten the "mousepads" for another run at it but we'll see because even after that these things won't ever fit in the box again unless they get folded :(

After one night of playing, slam-dunk 10. The perfect blend between a stupid fun flicking game and a tactical maneuvering wargame. You can play aggressively and go for a quick-kill, but you'll probably miss and kill yourself instead. Or you can take cautious flicks and get yourself into position while guarding against enemy attacks. Both strategies work. This game is hilarious and tense and short, so you can play it a ton of times. We loved it.

I went up against the girl of our group who loses everything all the time but is a great sport about it. After carefully advancing my troops and killing each one of her defenders, I had at least 7-8 units left and all she had left was her king. "Well, here goes nothing!" She flung her king from her castle to mine, in between two grunts, and sent mine flying while hers landed in my castle. It was beautiful.

Oh, and the copy we played on was massively folded and wouldn't stay flat at all, but we didn't even mind. In some situations, we made flicks just to try and get the high ground. It was very enjoyable, even with the flatness issue.

This is a great game for kids.  It's easy to learn and setup, the games are quick and they just seem to have fun.  I have two boys (5 and 7) and they love it.  My only complaint is that the mats don't lay flat very well and some of the stickers might eventually come off the cubes.  Great game though.

RATING: 6
Not a lot to say about this dexterity game. If you like flicking dice at other dice in a weird battlefield simulation, go for it.

It has some nice quirks. You can have a different army each time and set them up however you like (on your side of the map). And each dice has different abilities depending on how it lands after you flick it. Mainly, you're trying to flick dice at someone else's dice to flick them off the table.

It probably isn't the best 'palate cleanser' for when you're through playing more serious games? I'd go to things like Saboteur, Loopin' Chewie, Rhino Hero Super Battle or Flick 'Em Up for that. But it's good.

It's fun. It might get samey quickly.

Be aware that you will constantly have the sturdy dice falling on your floor and (probably) hitting your walls and going under cupboards constantly.

I was skeptical but pleasantly surprised.  The use of dice as flicking objects appears, at first, to be random -- however, it actually creates a good dilemma between gentle and forceful flicks.  The board does not lie entirely flat, but this turns out to also make the game interesting, as it adds terrain.  Simply allow the player who goes second to choose their board.  Army construction appears to be balanced and have some real choices involved.

Very funny dexterity game which is played quickly and always invites the players for a revenge. Unique game material such as the gameboard consisting of three play mats and a lot of tough plastic cubes.

I only can't go higher because I guess it would get old after too many plays in too short a time. And the capture mechanism, while functional, is a bit clunky. But for a lightning quick, goofy flicking game, it's pretty much perfect.

What am I marking this against? It doesn't stack up against my favourite games-that-take-more-than-five-minutes. It's a game of dexterity more than strategy (though the latter does apply). But despite - or because of - it's simplicity, Cube Quest has been an instant hit with both my games crowd and my children - who are both boys. Female players seem to be less than enamoured so I'd say it's a boy thing on the whole.

I picked this up at a B&N clearance table for less than $12 and it is ALMOST worth it. Luckily it was a 2nd Edition so they mats were playable. 

It is a fun game. We always laugh a lot and it gets us up and walking around the table like pool sharks. 

Questionable cube quality and the obvious annoyance of having to dig every piece out from behind furniture as they get flicked off the table might mean that we won't pull this out as often as Sorry Sliders and the like.

Once I get myself a real Crokinole board it will probably end up on my "for trade" pile.

This one is so quick to explain, to set up and to play. It's ridiculously hard to flick those light plastic cubes. It makes for some hilarious moments. The dexterity opens up for epic failures and outstanding success without any bad feelings from either side of the table. And then it's over as soon as it started. Which is fine too.

I want to love this so much. A quick dexterity game with some tactical play and the option to build different teams for varying styles of play.

After my first 2 plays, I'd have said this doesn't work at all and it seemed very much to be a case of whoever flicks hard enough will win, with both matches lasting fewer than 7 turns combined. The dice seemed too light and so flew across the play mats. Everyone agreed that with heavier dice, it would be less chaotic, less luck driven and would allow more strategy.

Then a weird thing happened. The power shooting player missed a couple of long-range shots and started to run low on pieces. That game ended with him having just his King left and so the other player was able to move in carefully and dispatch him from close range. The next two matches then became much more tactical and as a result, I enjoyed it a lot more. Perhaps this is worth the time to play some more and keep discovering...

It's official. For me, Flicking games need some meat on them. Like Ascending Empires, which is great. Otherwise, I'd might as well flick marbles. The game is okay, but when it comes to fun games there are contenders which work much better for me.

Really great little dexterity game, and only takes about 10 minutes to play! I'd rate it an 8 or 9, but the components are subpar: crummy light plastic dice with torn stickers and a folded playmat with unremovable creases make for a grumpy Dan.

The cubes themselves aren't very good (with stickers quite sloppily applied to them) and the playmats of the second edition aren't cut very well, but the game plays nice and fast, and well...offers what it is supposed to: 10 minutes of flicking fun.

If the physical board defects weren't so prominent (i.e., if the pads weren't so bumpy), this would be a great dice-flicking game.  As it stands, it's still awesome 5-minute fun, even if it does only support two players.  My favorite moment from our highlight reel was when I used my own king to knock my opponent's king off the table; unfortunately, my king was also carried off the edge, thus guaranteeing a double-loss.  There is no winner in war, folks.  Let this be a lesson.

Cube Quest is one of the few literal "light" games that I've played, as the cubes appear to be made of a previously unknown polymer that manages to have a negative density.  My guess is that the dice have been engineered by a secret branch of the military that is allowed to violate basic laws of physics, within reason.

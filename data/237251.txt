We are animal species that evolve to live longer in various climates, breed more, move faster and evolve quicker.  We are competing to meet various objectives that often relate to presence in or control of randomly placed landscape tiles.  Occupation of those tiles is contested increasingly often in the late game as species spread out and bump elbows.  As in many territorial control games, the player left alone to quietly build up will have a good chance of the win.  Ageing is handled in quite an interesting way, with critters represented by dice showing how long they have left to live and migration reducing life expectancy.  Multiple deaths each turn keep the territorial situation quite fluid, while a few well-placed, long-lived critters can leave an opponent's hopes of achieving an objective in ruins.  Overall, an enjoyable game.

Artwork is bland though functional. Production quality is pretty good. Do check the BGG rules forum for a link to the corrected rules.

Nettes Evolutionsspiel. Dominant Species finde ich jedoch besser, da dort mehr Interaktion herrscht.

Interesting game, but the card selection usually doesn't provide any interesting decisions(card has to fit to the size and type of your species, so it pretty random if cards help you or not) and the game lacked a mechanism to kick other players out of a territory.

Only playable with a maximum of 4players, otherwise there is to much downtime.

RATING: 8.5
Components: really good components, the board should have been added to the base
Complex: easy to learn, hard to play
Weight: medium- heavy
Players: 3 to 5
Length: shouldn't be more than 2 hours with 5 players
Mechanics: area control
Decisions: a lot, where to move, what to develop, where to birth
Opinion: this is a game about evolution and adaptability. You have to manage your specie and adapt it to the best according to the goals of the game, and these are related to controlling different terrain tiles.
This is the resume of the game, this is a really easy rules game, but with tough decisions and many things going on.
First, you have to adapt your specie each turn if you want to develop it with the cards available. Then you have to manage the length your specie can survive in each of the terrains, and this is done with the dice.
Yes, the dice, you can say they abstracts the game, but they are the best way to manage the life of your specie (you place the dice with the value according to the rondel and the life expectation you have on that terrain, and once the rondel reaches that number, they die).
Should I say I fall in love with the game? Explanation in 10 minutes, length less than 2 hors and a very depth game. You are fighting every round where to go in order to achieve the goals, and the one to fulfill 5 of those (there are 7 available) is the winner. Go step by step, focus on the now, but not forget the tomorrow

It's such a shame that most ppl don't know "Uruk II" or even the publisher and the same is true for this game. I knew I had to play this once I got an explanation when this was still in development and well, they nailed it!

This is one of the best evolution games out there and reminds me quite a bit of "Wildlife", but without the direct interaction. It's kinda fast and there arn't that many rules, but yet there's alot of stuff to do and look out for.

If you like the theme, try it!

Fresh new ideas in this game.
Although it is thematic, there are some mechanic add-ons (Tie-Braker) which brake the thematic feeling of the game. Would have been better to choose a consequent thematic design.

Excellent use of dice in a game in which each player is a species, not trying to avoid extinction, but spreading around the modular board trying to achieve 5 out of 7 possible objectives. A clever game indeed.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Found this quite interesting although it was a bit odd that there was no way to remove an opponent's die. There is an ebb and flow to the dice on the board as numbers come due to die and become extinct - managing this ebb and flow is a key aspect of the game. First and foremost, do NOT forget that this is a race game - each person is trying to accomplish 5 of the 7 goals before anyone else and then it comes down to tiebreakers. The dice are never rolled in this game; they are only used as markers to indicate when the species gets removed from the board. There are quite a few ways to modify and strengthen your particular species (or change the size, etc) to meet development card responsibilities. Will be important to block opponents and look ahead. Movement can be huge - don't dismiss it out of hand thinking reproduction and income is necessarily more important.

Jeder würfelt seine Würfel, ordnet sie nach Farben an. In der Runde kann man Karten erwerben, die die Würfelwerte beeinflussen. Man versucht mit den Werten die Aufträge der Karten zu erfüllen, was Punkte bringt.

Played once. Very interesting game with a well-implemented evolution theme and clever use of dice to see how long "critters" will live.

How can six turns take two hours? Four turns of building up your abilities and numbers and then suddenly its all over. Not sure how much different game 2 would be.

Much better than I expected with a few fun mechanisms but a lousy scoring system.  The aging dice were a lot of fun and made for interesting choices.  I actually like the cards, a kind of American Megafauna superlight where you need to match size and specilization to utilize.  The adjustment of living space ratings nice, as was the purchasing mechanism.  The other track was a little silly.  The theme not really there but still fun.  The end goal cards are a bit silly (control all spaces in a cross?) but their variability will make the game play differently.  Pleasant surprise.  Could really use some variation between the species, maybe just as a nod to the theme.

Easily my favorite game of the month and one I can't wait to play again! Had a wonderful time learning and I heard of one issue people were running into but you simply don't have to play with that rule and just play the game. I am terribly excited for this one! Can't wait to explore more!

Uses a Ponzi Scheme style timer which means your animals are doomed...Clever, not too rule heavy and does not overstay its welcome. Only complaint is that the dice do not convey the theme and can be a bit fiddly,

The calculations involving different numbers for turns, terrain, and dice (and all different for each player) got old. I enjoy making calculations in a game, but I want them to be used to determine good moves, not just figuring out what level an automatic placement appears at. That's the sort of thing that is better computerized - in fact, this would be much better as a computer game than board game.

After one game: Brillant. A new mechanism, that eliminates older generations of creatures (dices). With that the abstract game gets a thematical atmosphere.

One of the best games I played in Essen 2017. Very innovative mechanisms involved. I liked the species you place die after a some rounds so the game gets a lot more dynamic than most majority games.

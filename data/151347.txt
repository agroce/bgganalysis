This is unlike anything else I've played, and I enjoy weird games. Kudos to L99 for producing a game that really does feel like one is engaged in the CCG lifestyle (by and large). A couple things stand out to me, the time component is both fantastic, and required; the point here is to treat large segments of the game as though you were dealing with big data. It's a question of contextualizing and sussing out combos between cards quickly. During the tournaments, it's a matter of properly anticipating any counters to your combos by early flipping and pulling off as much of yours as possible. I do find it mildly amusing that a background to all of this is one of the best ways to get points; building collections (much like one would try and put together a set of Magic cards). This is the driver for trades and some of the aftermarket churn; you'll need some cards for a set building, but not necessarily specific ones which would require the store deck to cycle faster (and it almost never does). The icing on the cake, and ultimately what helps non-CCG veterans enjoy it is that the game doesn't take itself all that seriously with it's flavor text and thematic depictions. 

Folks who enjoy fast play, and a surprising amount of depth in the strategic space of CCG culture will enjoy this with one caveat. I find that getting new players up to speed, not bad, but you need people who will intentionally sacrifice some strategy analysis in trade for efficiency. This is not a game for AP riddled players, they found it very frustrating (but that is a necessity, it's a game of quickly contextualizing the value of something).
Much like other L99 games, this has gobs of content in the box, really enjoyed it.

Love this game. It's everything I hoped it would be from the kickstarter. Took most of my players about half the first game to really catch on. There is some learning curve so follow the rulebook's advice and use the suggested sets and no character powers for your first time.  We've barely scratched the surface and I can't wait to play again and again.

Wow. Just, wow. This game (like Argent before it) exemplifies “nothing exceeds like excess”. Unlike Argent, this game kind of creates it’s own category... there is literally nothing else like it.

My brain melts when I play this. It’s super fun to find the best combos under pressure!

My only complaints are that it’s a huge pain to set up and put away. The deck of cards is just too big. Also, ideally players would know the contents of the decks that are in the game since part of the simulation is hunting for the best cards. We don’t play often enough to be able to do this, and that feels like a wasted opportunity.

RATING: 7
1st play: This game does exactly what it sets out to do. It captures the feel of being part of a CCG scene. You buy, trade, and sell cards, build collections, adapt to changing meta, compete in tournaments, hunt promos, and build decks. There are a TON of cards here, and we only played with about half of them. The art is great and the game brought back feelings of nostalgia for my old Magic and L5R days. If you don't like CCGs for reasons beyond cost, you probably won't like this either.

2nd play: Lots of different deck types are possible, but it felt like attacks decks must always be planned for. I like that every deck can be countered and meta'd against. I wish collections weren't so point heavy, but that could be because I didn't have much luck collecting the combinations of cards I needed. The possible combinations of cards in this are ridiculous and I'm pleased with how it brings back the CCG feeling.

[i]2017/05/18 - 1 play 4 players[/i]

This game is a riot : it simulates the entire arc of a professional collectible card player from the creation of a collection through 3 tournaments into stardom.

The game is tongue in cheek and is very good at evoking all  the trappings of competitive collectible card gaming: 
- spending loads of money on boosters to get crappy cards (dumping entire blundles of money feels really thematic)
- simulating an evolving meta through the championships
- scouring the secondary marked to complete your deck
- making huge collections
- haggling with your friends/opponents for cards (which makes the 3-4 player count ideal for this game)

The attention to detail is amazing: you have a character with specific powers, you can go to a tournament with accessories (I love the hooded cloak of discretion that deviates attacks on other players), can exchange 'friendship cards' if you make a deal with other players.

The real time phase of deck construction is very clever in preventing AP and simulating the frenzy and difficulties of deck-building in preparation of a tournament.

The game mechanics are well thought out. There is one mechanism which is crucial for gameplay but not at all thematic, the ability to dump sets of cards to gain powerful promo cards. This pushes the game forward by introducing powerful cards that irrigate the game through decks or the secondary market. Nevertheless the authors managed to brilliantly spin it by calling the mechanic "card fuzion©".

Although the game may seem intimidating (specially the real time aspect), the rules are actually fairly simple, even though the huge number of cards is overwhelming. But that is part of the shtick, I think it would spoil the game to study all cards [i]ad nauseam[/i]. The challenge is to create a deck with limited info, time, etc.

It should be noted that there is an intro mode for new games that is very good at teaching the game while avoiding downtime: players start directly with a restricted tournament and without character powers, before going through two rounds of deck-building and tournament. As the rest of the game, it's very efficient in getting new gamers into play.

Every phase flows at a fast clip, and the tournament mechanics are streamlined, interesting and don't bog the game down. Basically one needs to place 6 cards that will interact positionally and through specific abilities. Like CCG, the point is to identify combos and build a deck to reinforce them. 

The illustrations and text on the cards are chokefull of pop and CCG references (I had a Harvey Potmaker card) and convey very efficiently the goofy mood of the game.

Overall the gameplay of this game is solid and efficient. There are a couple of strong strategies (collection creation cannot be ignored) and replayability is huge.

I bought Epic Card Game in order to replicate the CCG experience (cube, card rarity, etc), but Millenium Blades blows it out of the park by simulating the entire experience, and with a riotous laughter. I particularly enjoyed ending the last tournament by "flipping the table" with an ability card.

I was so worried that I wouldn't like this game after I bought it. The idea definitely hooked me, but there were so many things that could go wrong. Real time? Ick! And as a real life competitive gamer, those "tournaments" seemed a bit shallow. I've never been happier to be wrong. This is a very large game, so the review is going to be commensurately huge.

• Millennium Blades brings all the humor and light-hearted fun of an anime card game (and making fun of it).

• The actual interactive system whereby you play the cards is an intense puzzle that factors in every player and every single card of every single player.

• There are a TON of variants. My personal favorite is where you scrap all your cards from the game after they're used in a tournament and get their value in money back. This means your deck doesn't stagnate after each round.

• The realtime aspect ended up being fun instead of stressful, except for a few hiccups: If you have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder OR Dyslexia, you NEED to ask people for a few extra minutes. If you don't, you will have a bad time and it will ruin the entire experience for you. Luckily, the actual rulebook allows extra time to be added. The timer is just to give a sense of pace, NOT to ruin the fun.

• The economy system was brilliant! I've already won a game just due to an opponent recklessly selling a single high value card, which I proceeded to pick up and immediately demolish them with.

• The cards feel like actual cards from a card game. While the gameplay itself is nothing like a CCG, the cards have enough personality and do enough different things to really feel like you're playing Cloud from FF7 (excuse me, "Blizzard"). I especially love the packs such as "Obari as Hell". If you're an Obari mech fan, you already get it.

• Despite the massive store deck, tons of randomness, and some cards blatantly just being better or even overpowered, this game never felt infuriating. Somehow, it handles being deliberately unbalanced with grace and elegance, allowing players to combat OP bullshit with mundane decks. As an example, there's a card that's basically Exodia and grants +100 RP (a fucking lot for one card) if you assemble one of every type and element. A bit hard to do and you definitely deserve the reward if you pull off something that risky. And yet...I beat that strategy with a rather mundane strategy and got significantly more RP, which is how you win tournaments.

On to the bad about the game:

• For such an excellent game, the 2P variants are rather lackluster. Card games like this are typically played as dueling games, so I felt a bit betrayed that the VP system was thrown out in favor of winning rounds.

• The turn-based variant is complete dogshit and no one should even try it. Honestly, why did they even bother wasting the paper it was printed on? This can't really detract since it's not the "main" game, but avoid at all costs.

• The card quality leaves much to be desired. It's at least not badfeel like Dominion cards, but the thin seemingly greycore quality of the cards gets on my nerves. With this many cards, it's a huge pain in the ass to sleeve them. That said, pennysleeves (or Mayday "fits") are acceptable here.

• The art falls flat for me personally. Some people are going to love the 90s-style self-referential and joking art style, but I can see they pushed a small team way too far. It's very obvious that this was a quantity over quality thing. I don't heavily fault them for having ugly card frames (I should) nor white backgrounds on art (I should), but I do fault them for the "deviantArt" looking western comic pictures. There's absolutely nothing western comicbook about card games.

• The pure white player boards are incredibly boring to look at and you do spend a lot of the game time looking at them. I assume this was to save on design cost and ink cost, but going just a tiny bit further here would've made the game's quality jump considerably. Likewise, the "fat stacks of cash" are garbage. Throw them away. Fuck people who say they're fun, they aren't. It takes 2 hours to bind them with stickers and in the end it STILL feels like shitty Monopoly money because it is. It's everything awful about paper money minus like...the difficulty in picking it up.

One final thing: BE AWARE that you absolutely must play the Prerelease game, I don't care how you feel about tutorials. If you don't play it, you will have the worst time during the first round. Unless you've experienced what your starter deck can do and how the tournament works before, you will be building your first deck BLIND which kills the fun of the game and makes it feel random.

Millennium Blades calls itself a CCG simulator and that's a completely accurate description.  As others have said, your reaction to this game is likely to depend on your enjoyment of building a deck the old-fashioned way and then of testing how effectively your cards combine.  I never adopted the CCG lifestyle, but that process of refining a deck and then of playing  cards in the most effective order holds some interest.   The trouble is that the refining and testing  plus time pressure are about all Millennium Blades has to offer over a two-hour playing time.

Like other Level 99 games Millennium Blades is a great big box full of stuff.  There is huge variability in the sets of cards with which you will play each game.  Card quality is pretty good, while the artwork is evocative of its subject.  The rules are an easy read, but I would have appreciated a more thorough explanation of terms used on the cards.

The most ridiculous, epic non-wargame I own. The Campaign for North Africa of Ameritrash. A game about games, specifically the delirious, bankrupting world of CCGs. The rules are straightforward, but the HUNDREDS of cards present players with  an overwhelming tsunami of choices that must be made under brutal time pressure. More hilarious pop-culture and gaming in-jokes per ounce than any game around. Kudos to the rule that prohibits take-backs for mistakes. You'll be exhausted and delighted when the last card in the last tourney hits the mat.

RATING: 8.3
Another win for Level99, with quite a curious concept...a metagame lampooning the CCG player culture, and also a cute CCG within that game. Love how the different single card 'packs' represent the thrill of opening boosters, and the whole 'after market' concept with which you can spend money to customize your decks for tournaments. The art is a mixed bag, simply because there is so much of it. Manga level in some instances, more cheap looking in others, but the way all these different pop culture packs fit into the whole is a great sendup of Yu-Gi-Oh, Magic, and other card dueling games. Millennium Blades is quite cool indeed, and in typical bigger box Level99 fashion, you can get a TON of game play with this enormous base set.

HOWEVER...

Having to sticker all that crappy paper money together to form 'bundles', one of the game's gimmicks, is decidedly not fun. Not. Fun. Sure, it's easier to handle the bundles later than individual paper currency, but it's obnoxious to set them all up and using chits or plastic coins or some other alternative still would have been superior.

attention duelists, if you love collectible card games, you'll love millenium blades. In this game, you don't play as magical summoners or shit liek that. Instead you play as yourself..someone who spends wads of cash on a children's card game. boy is this game self-effacing. part of the game is building a rad collection which only you will appreciate, earning you imaginary gold stars. 

The first thing we noticed upon unboxing the game were the dolla bills. I havent used paper money in a game since monopoly, so this was refreshing. But wait, theres more. The game instructs you to construct 'wads' or 'phat stacks' of bills so you feel more badass plopping down a meaty load of money for a card depicting a cartoon fairy. 
I don't know about you, but that definitely makes me feel badass.  of course, you could always just use the bills individually, but then you will not be badass. plus its in the rulebook so you gotta follow it you anarchist. 
what an amazing game. It truly captures the campiness that only a show about a children's card game can evoke. Unfortunately, the game box did not include Duel Disks (TM) which generate holographic representations of the cards. It also did not come with a shadow realm in which to banish the losers. For this reason, I rate it a 7.8 and not a 9. Would not recommend for small children as im pretty sure i saw some tits on a card. highly inappropriate.

Fun game - but it seemed like the most excitement came from building your deck in the initial phase of the game and being unfamiliar with the cards.

It might be more fun to 1) make the starter decks weaker or 2) possibly require the deck cards to be retired?  Maybe require the starter deck cards to be turned in after the first round?

Then again, it might be best to simply turn in the starter deck cards as a collection.  (Additionally, our first and only game had each player getting their elemental dragon from the gold fusion pile!)

-------------------------
A very unique game for sure.  There are already like a billion cards, and this is card combo heaven.  Found the deck building / set collection to be a ton of fun, and it really does a good job of simulating opening a booster pack from a CCG.  Won't be for everyone, but for people that enjoy LCG / TCG / Card combo games (Rftg?), I think this will be a huge hit.  Does run a bit long, but most definitely does not outstay its welcome even at 3 rounds.

Millennium Blades is a simple game but the premise it is based on sings to me. As a former MtG & A:NR player, I just love looking for combos. building decks and competing in tournaments. The fact that the game is played in real-time is also a big plus. This is not your typical resource conversion game, but rather a stress management game. Choices are many and your brain must run against the clock to separate the wheat from the chaff. I LOVE IT! 

I also adore the many references to the geek culture. What can I say, this game was designed just for people like me. Top contender along Terraforming Mars for Game of the Year 2016.

I think one of the reasons I find Millennium Blades so entertaining is that unlike "traditional" deck-builders that follow from Dominion or Ascension, Millennium Blades doesn't "lock you in"; if you buy cards and build a deck for the first tournament and it doesn't work out, there is nothing to stop you from completely rethinking your strategy and rebuilding your deck (almost) from scratch. So you can lose the first tournament badly and crush it later; you may still not win, but at least it feels like you're doing stuff. In a traditional deck-builder like Thunderstone or Dominion it tends to be fairly clear your screwed halfway through the game and there isn't really anything you can do about it, because you just can't make wholesale - or even major - changes to your deck to change directions.

Definitely do not increase the time limits beyond 7/7/6. This is plenty of time. If you can't get it done in that time, an extra few minutes isn't going to help. The realtime element of the game means it won't be for some people, but the timing is fairly well calibrated. There is time pressure, but there are also cash limits and there is no reason for the game to be frantic. You have the time. You just need to be smart about it.
---
I've seen a couple suggestions that increasing the time allotments from 7/7/6 to 10/10/6 or 10/8/6 helps the game. I disagree, actually; I think 7/7/6 is not only fine, but it even could be shorter, 6/6/6 or 6/6/5. 20 minutes is more than sufficient time to churn through cards and do deckbuilding. I found myself with several minutes of unused time waiting for people to finish, and easily won. The whole point of the game (or one of the points, anyway) is that you don't have time for everything and you have to know how to budget time and attention wisely and how to rapidly filter. If you're taking the time to read and parse every card that comes through your hand you're doing it wrong.

I really enjoyed this game on a lot of levels. I like the timed, free-form aspect, I like that there is more information than you can parse and you can never really make perfect decisions, you've got to stay focussed and be smart and adaptable. And of course the homage to the craziness of CCGs is absolutely terrific and a great blast from the past.

I was surprised by how much I liked Millennium Blades. I don't like the "screw-you" feel of some of the interactive cards (flips, clashes). But the fun of building a deck in a short period of time, and the joy of finding the perfect card to tie your deck together makes it worth it. It's tense, heavy, thrilling, and my heart beats so fast as I am playing the contest, with the constant self questioning of "Am I really going to pull this off?"

Just not our cup of tea. You need A LOT of plays (20++) of this game for it to really shine and more experienced (read as: people who know the decks) players will have a HUGE advantage. 

I get the appeal but, for us, it meant too much commitment for a game that did not really feel that "rewarding".

The simulation of CCG tournaments and collecting surprisingly works in this game, a game within a game. It's a highly daunting game because of the many variety of cards in the game to flip through. This game is definitely targeted for a specific audience of gamers who have played CCGs and are familiar with the concepts. That said, it is not very accessible for newcomers. There's so many cards in this game to grasp it takes a good amount of consistent play to understand not only your own cards but the cards being played by your opponents, and most cards are highly powerful, and there is quite a bit of ambiguity with some cards. There's not much for interaction in this game other than trying to flip opponents cards, and this makes it very difficult to stop a player with a strong deck, a player has to focus on a hate deck to overcome someone else's strong deck. Also, I wish there was more to the scoring than just the highest RP, it seems to simplified and generic.The deck building and set collection portion is my favorite part because of the nostalgic play of being a CCG collector/player. The card effects and tournament are okay, nothing too special, anti-climatic. Overall, I applaud this game for it's innovative approach and design. It is a good game for the right crowd and there is plenty in this box to keep the game fresh.  This is a game for those who will not take this game lightly, there needs to be a devotion to playing Millennium Blades consistently, otherwise it will feel too chaotic with the masses of cards and effects.

Millenium Blades does some crazy things that I've never seen in a board game and does it fantastically.

It is a "CCG Simulator". In contrast to "Living Card Games", this is about role playing a CCG tournament player. You collect, trade, and sell your cards. All of that works brilliantly and is very fast paced. While the game talks about playing for 2+ hours, all of that time is packed and it doesn't slow down. 

That is largely because the building phase happens in real time. Everyone is simultaneously talking, reading, grabbing, and trading. This is an energetic game.

The tournaments are relatively short so as not to take away from the building phase. This gives you enough time to have multiple rounds of each. The tournament is mostly won before it starts based on deck compositions, but you don't know for sure until it finishes. Some decks that are good at countering other decks might require more strategy.

This game has parodies and references coming out of its pores and they are fantastic. Everyone will get at least some of the references and they stretch far and wide. Most of the cards are silly enough on their own that you don't need to understand the reference to have fun with them.

Before I got this, I was worried that it would become bogged down in analysis paralysis or that opponent's strategies would be too obvious and easily countered. Neither of those happened in our games, though I would check other reviews to get a better feel.

If you are the type of person who wants to add unique games to your collection, this is a must have (as are many other Level 99 games). It is also totally worth playing on its own merits and will be difficult to topple by any alternative.

This game was everything it was promised to be.  Each character we played with has a spectacular ability we all felt was great.  The timers on the build phase really add the game and keep the pace more reasonable for all.  The tournaments within the game are their own deep enough game.  I can not wait to get this back to the table.

What an experience. How to begin to even summarise it? Succinctly and convincingly captures the entire essence of the TCG hobby, from buying, collecting, playing, all tie-up in a fun game. I do think the designers went a little OTT with the whole setting (a thousand years, the game entrenched in society, priceless relic cards... all maybe a little *too* much). But that little niggle aside, the variety in sets is staggering. Acquiring cards really does evoke that same sense as in real-life (the cardback images depicting an unopened booster pack was a stroke of genius), and the game itself... not terribly complex, but solid - and enjoyable to play. One cannot ask for more than that.

This is a truly innovative title - both designers and publisher deserve major kudosfor taking the risk.

I'm a former Magic player, and part of the fun of playing Magic was just building decks and seeing what combos I could put together.  This is a game about doing just that.  Replayability is through the roof with all the different sets you choose from each time (and the Set Rotation expansion on the way, adding even more).  I'm not sure I'll ever tire of this one.

This game is just fun and adrenaline and craziness in a box. I am continually impressed that the game functions and that a human being came up with how to make all of this work. After every game I have played I have thought, "this is more fun than it has any right to be." This game is so exciting we have to be careful when we play it so there is enough "cool down" time after all that excitement. A Top 10 Game.

An ambitious, involved, complex, ingenious ode of love to the CCG hobby. Mechanics-wise, Millennium Blades carves its own niche with a delightful mixture of real-time, sensory overload inducing combo-crafting paired with a less stressful, but equally important resolution phase. Both mentally satisfying and exhausting, this game has my synapses firing non-stop.

I was very excited for this game when I first heard of it, but it hasn't really lived up to my hopes. It's a mediocre set collection/deck design game attached to a less-than-mediocre tableau-based card game. The combination of these two sides of the game is greater than the sum of its parts, but still not good enough. It can be fairly fun, but not in a way that appeals to me. It's hard to accept after such hype and such cost, but this one isn't for me.

RATING: 7
It's very strange to feel nostalgia while playing a board game for the first time.

I overall like the game, but am much less fond of the set-collection than the tournament piece (though I see how it fits into the design). I also tend to prefer tournaments which are towards the higher end of interactivity, and strongly suspect I want to try the "liquidate your deck after each tournament" variant from the rules - it's less fun when someone runs a virtually identical deck for 2 (or worse, 3) tournaments. (Much more so when there's less interactivity, so you can't even disrupt it very well.)

This game, like anything from L99, is completely unique.  The game is comprised of a random, chaotic and timed deck-building phase, and then a simple tableau building phase.  Each on its own is nothing special, but combined it makes for a very fun experience.  You need to balance the needs to build a good deck, a good collection, and make some money along the way.  Oh, and hopefully disrupt your opponents plans (especially in Rounds 2 and 3).

The actual tournament play doesn't compare to something like Seasons, but it is fun to see your deck play out (or, in my case, fail to play out).  Then you get to rebuild it, if you want.  The market phase opens the door to different lines of strategy for your tournament deck, as well as the other aspects of that phase. 

Ultimately sent to purgatory only because it never gets played

RATING: 5
Highly replayable but doesn't have the same aspects of CCG/LCG style games that I like the most which is the combat.

Deckbuilding is most interesting when you can craft a strategy to defeat an opponent whereas this plays out more like a euro game in a contest of points.

A meta might develop but I didn't get that sense since the cards that I ended up drafting sort of dictated a more random strategy. I assume if I play more I might know what to draft in order to get certain strategies to come up better but playing this, I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd rather be playing an LCG instead of a meta game about card games.

The sheer scope of this game is incredible. Every time I play it I'm impressed by how *much* content there is. It does as advertised - it encapsulates the CCG experience in a 2-3 hour time block. Millennium Blades becomes way better once all the players know how to play, but its like a CCG as well in that sense as well. Teaching the game is often quite labor-intensive and takes a bit of experience to really grasp. The real-time element of the game is helpful in that you can get bogged down in the minutia of decision-making. Many times we find that we're all ready to go before time runs out but that limit can be a real element. The variety of cards leads to some fascinating boards and rewards clever combinations and aggressive buying/selling/trading. Every time I have played I've seen different decks from all players... which shouldn't be surprising with 700 cards in the box. I'd play it more if I had more friends with the time and the desire to engage in a massive experience like this one.

Why this isn't a 10:
-> Massive scope leads to massive set-up (often 20-30 minutes or more)
-> High complexity and lots of reading limit possible participants
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Cool game but I think we need more than the allotted 7/7/6 minutes the first couple of times we play this. I at least felt that I never really had the time to read all the cards I got.

I really like the CCG feel of it, broken combos and all. And with the amount of cards you get you'll never see the same combos twice.

Rating likely to go up with more plays.

Played at GenCon 2017.  Got an authentic CCG experience out of it -- had a teacher that was glad to teach the game, but partly just wanted to beat some new players.  Then had an experienced player show up, who acted like a jerk, expected everyone to pander to him, and through knowing how to do all sorts of combos destroyed what little fun this game had.  Best of all, this person was a volunteer for the Level 99 booth!

So yep, it perfectly simulates a CCG.  Hard pass for me.

Excellent game that captures all the good parts of CCGs (mostly) without bothering you so much with the rest of it.  It plays out in two main phases - deckbuilding and tourneys.  Each card represents the one rare you get in a booster and you build your "deck" around these.  The rest of the rabble is abstracted to a single "deck box" card that gives you certain abilities during the tournaments.

During the deckbuilding phase, an accumulative 20 minutes of real-time are given to you to buy/sell/trade your cards and build collections and your ultimate tourney deck which you bring into the next phase.  This involves throwing literal wads of paper money around as you fish for cards from face-down "booster packs" or buy them from the aftermarket board and organizing yourself for the inevitable showdown.  This can be incredibly stressful since you need to balance a multitude of options while also reading your cards, organizing them, and putting them where you want them to be when the 20 minutes is up.

Following this is the tourney phase, which is not timed.  Each player will play a card one at a time and take an optional action which can be devastating.  Basically, this is the phase where your previous 20-minute rush bares fruit or leaves you hanging from the rafters (something I often do because this game simulates the CCG model so well, I suck at it even when it's fake).  This is the crux of the game as the tourneys are where you will win most of your precious victory points.  Throughout the tourney, your cards will earn your ranking points and where you place in the tourney determines how many VPs you walk away with.  It's hella fun, but if you aren't careful, you might end up being your worst hurdle (for example, I made a critical error of forgetting that using a card's action flips it face down, robbing me of anything with which to use my hidden scoring cards).

Where I find a possible issue is the point spread, but it does reflect proper tournament structure.  That is to say, if you place 3rd for two tourneys, even placing first in the last, most important tourney won't win you the game.  With that in mind, it thus becomes critical to have knowledge of the card pool and for new players, this simply isn't a possibility unless they spend a good day reviewing the 500+ cards that come packed with the game (promos and expansions put MB over 600 cards available in the pool, though you will only play each game with a significant subset of these).

The sheer variety available to you to set up each game is mind-boggling and a bit cumbersome, so this isn't a game to take lightly and play only once.  It is designed to be enjoyed multiple times with multiple configurations.  Generally speaking, you take a core set of cards (a huge stack), mix in some "expansion sets", premium sets, master sets, etc to create the "Store" for the 3 rounds of deckbuilding and tourneys to come.  This is not a small stack and even then, you're using maybe 15-20% of the entire card pool.  This is a LOT of games to be played and even if you were to use the same set-up several times, you're still looking at 3-4 plays just to learn that specific combo.

The entire key to the game is learning how cards will combo together in the tourneys and one of the rules is explicit in that you cannot undo your mistakes.  This hammers in how you learn what [i]not[/i] to do and I think this is key, though it may rub people the wrong way.  Only through failure can you really figure out how to best play with these cards, but given the length of the game (expect around 3 hours at the least), that may not be something you can afford to do.  However, if you have the luxury of a common group that can put some good time into this, Blades will open itself up to you; only then would I recommend switching the sets around to throw everyone for a loop.

Protip: Be very wary of "Score:" cards.  Those can swing a tournament very far away from you if you aren't in a position to counter or stop someone from using them effectively.

Fantastic game!  Play it!

See my full review for more details but this is a must own for any CCG enthusiast.  Just an amazingly well done game.  My only complaint is the insert but even that is not enough to knock this one down in my book.  It won't be for everyone... but even players who don't like this style of game will be able to tell it is well designed and a good game.  
EDIT: Over time it has faded to a 9 for me as it is a lengthy game that can sometimes just be brutal (some card combos are nuts) and not everyone loves it (so can be hard to hit the table)... but just an amazingly well designed game that is a lot of fun.

RATING: 7
As someone in the target audience for the game, I had blast playing it. Considering I hate real time in board games, that is saying something. The fresh idea and execution of the game needs to be applauded.

There are two halves to this game, the battle portion where you play an OK "build card effects to score points, with chaotic intervention from opponents" is not all that new and is executed better in other games on the market. The deck building - card selling portion of the game is the exciting part. Unless you've played this game A LOT, you will be lost in the panic, since there is no humanly possible way to evaluate and decide on the need for dozens of cards at once in a frantic ticking away time setting. I found myself latching onto one manageable element of the cards and ignoring the rest.

If you have ever enjoyed a good CCG, this game is worth a romp through, but I can't see the staying power after playing it a few times.

I would highly recommend playing this before buying, I doubt many will want to play this very often.

I like everything about this except everything about playing it. No aspect of playing this game felt at all fun or even interesting to me. 

The Art, design and flavor are all very well done. The theme sets are cool, unless you try to play with them. 

Overall it is confusing (to other players, I found it to simplistic) but you have tons of cards to go through in a very short time, then you end up waiting for time to just run out you it can finally be blissfully over. The trading element sounds awesome in theory, but in reality, if you ever actually get a trade to work it feel like you won the lottery, I'm sure some people are playing with players that make any trade their opponents want, which is probably worse. The game play of laying out the cards seemed very dull. You don't have many options when you get to that point, so the interaction is like a cruel joke you can't really avoid or respond to.

Like actual CCG's, this wasn't for me.  Everything about this screams "kickstarter" and insufficient playtesting.  Who thought a stack of 1's being worth 1 made sense?  There isn't an easier way to set up and tear down than mixing together 15 different decks (which are literally impossible to effectively randomize through human shuffling)?  How are players supposed to read the text on the cards in the public market? I guess buying the random cards accurately simulates buying boosters, but the result is very swing-y.  Then you build your 8 card "deck" but without knowing what your opponents are doing, it's little more than min/maxing  hoping everything works out. Now do that for 3 hours.

It seems like the game was put together by some people who thought "Aren't CCG's AWESOME?! And wouldn't a card game about card games be AWESOME and HILARIOUS?!!! Oh, Oh, Oh - What if we put in pop culture references?!!!!"   and then they didn't bother to check whether or not the game itself was interesting or any fun to play.  

There's probably a decent 45 minute game in here, but the designers didn't find it.

I wanted this game to feel like a deck builder, but it just doesn't.  It must be skewed entirely towards CCG (I wouldn't know since I'm not really familiar with CCGs), which is fine if that's what you're looking for.  

The anime art and components (thick stacks of banded money) are good.  There are a huge number of different cards with different abilities.  There are a lot of interesting combinations.  That being said, no one in our group really liked the game that much.  It's a solid game that's just missing something to be really exceptional.

I can't imagine this getting to the table often, so I might end up trading it. The gameplay is fun, but takes too long (do I really need that much time to build decks?) And there needs to be a better solution for building the deck of cards... shuffling all of those is a beast, as is tearing them all down, as is organizing them.
Nothing in this game is streamlined or user-friendly.

A moderately glorious mess. Don't get me wrong; this needed a lot more development than it got, so plenty of rules interactions are underdefined (or worse) and it might take some work to convince me that the character powers are balanced. But it's fun.

Feels more like a Magic tournament (Sealed Deck) than any other board game I've played. (Including the part where you have too many cards to even keep track of, and paring them down to a deck is part of the challenge.)

This game truly captures some of the franticness, obsession, and stupidity of CCGs.  It has killed any desire I may have had to ever get into another CCG again.  The gameplay is fun, balancing risk, reward, social interaction, and simple "tournaments" to have an overall winner who genuinely comes through.  Very solid stuff.

It's designed to replicate an entire lifetime of Collectable Card Gaming in an afternoon. I love deck building so was curious, but I've never been one for CCGs.

I hated the time pressures. Time is a rubbish mechanic in games. There's too little time to properly process through the AP.

There's so much to read, there's so much to process, there's so much randomness in terms of being dealt 6 cards per round.

I wish I had 4 people to sit down and play this game back to back. It's a very interesting game and I love the trading card aspect. This is essentially an economical game where you have to manage the money you have and see what cards to buy and sell.

Update: The card interactions and rules are clunky at times and I can't seem to find anyone who would be willing to play this again and again. I love the game concept of buying and trading cards though! Just... not 4 hours of it.

This captures the feeling of playing a ccg perfectly without that pesky need to spend tons of money. It's pretty easy to teach, but hard to master. The cards are plentiful, and filled with jokes riffing on the ccg scene, but it's never mean. This was obviously made by fans of the genre.
It's probably not for everyone, but to CCG fans, economic fans, and card game fans, it's really worth trying out.

I heard this described as a deckbuilder at the heart so I figured I'd give it a shot. But what I prefer about deckbuilders over constructed deck games is that they reduce the decision space from (thousands choose 60) to (10 choose 1 or 2). I prefer to make interesting tactical decisions on the fly rather than spend hours setting up a deck.

This game goes back and bloats the decision space back up to (30 choose 11) plus (buy a bunch of cards semi-blind and hope they work). And each of those 30 cards has a wall of text on it and four symbols that trigger various effects. You're supposed to parse through all these on the fly and determine if your synergies are better than your opponents', which is pretty much impossible, short of memorizing the 200+ unique effects in each game. And all this is rather complicated, considering that in the end that 80% of the effects just turn some kind of symbol into points.

All in all, it's a confusing, muddled mess of a game, just like the CCGs it tries to simulate.

Because of the incredibly long game length, I think the game suffers from inflation. There are too many expansion decks to work with and there's incredibly limited character interaction.

Deckbuilding game where you simulate being a CCG player. Your deckbuilding phases involve you buying blind boosters, selling and buying singles in the aftermarket and building a collection/trade binder. You get these nice stacks of cash in the game that give you a great tactile feeling to throwing down money on some cards. The real time component of the game is great and adds to the tension of building your deck and waiting to see what your opponent is trying to do.

The tournaments themselves are based around getting ranking points by building combo decks, decks that are meant to mess up your opponent, pretty much any kind of deck you can think of from CCGs.

The theming is amazing and there's a plethora of references to many other games and series in the different sets.

The one con to the game is the MASSIVE stack of cards you have to shuffle before each game. The sheer amount of cards is great but just barely fits back in the box once sleeved, most likely going to have to store the next set of expansions and promo packs in another box. Definitely recommend getting the insert from go7gaming for keeping it organized.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (June 2016)

I played MtG for around 13 years, so I was very keen on trying Millennium Blades. After playing it I had some mixed feeling about the game.

The theme is very novel and so much of the game revolves around it. It is indeed a very thematic game and I love to see the parodies of MtG and Yugioh. Having saying that, it isn’t a theme that really excites me.

The art is very well done as is usual from Level99 Games. The game components are also high quality. I especially like how they handled the paper money issue. Money is a pain to set up for the first time, but after that, it is very nice to play with it.

The rules aren’t hard to grasp, but there are many rules so the game can be explained under 25 minutes. I haven’t read the rulebook, but the friend who did said it was hard to understand and there were some holes in it. To me, Millennium Blades has a Light-Medium weight, the complexity arises due to the sheer number of cards available, not due to the game mechanism or the decisions involved in it. The decisions needed to play the game aren’t very hard, just the opposite, the combos that work together are glaringly obvious. 

Playtime is around 3 hours which is way to long for what the game offers. Best with 3 players, I refuse to ever play it again as a 5 player game, the downtime is way too much. I’m keen on trying it as a two player game, I think the game uses a different set of rules played this way.

I really like timed building phase, you need to open boosters, trade and form you deck in a limited time setting.  On the other hand, the tournament phase is quite obvious and the surprises are the “take that” moments. Everything else is pre planned and, often you cannot react to the attacks anyway (because you didn’t bring enough defense cards). There is no tension whatsoever.

I also like the idea of the campaign mode for the game and it would be nice if I could play through it.

There is a lot of uncontrollable luck with the game, from the blind booster buy (which accurately depicts the process in real life) to the promo trades. A player can get lucky at the beginning and win the whole game due to a powerful combo he got in the very first round. This is a HUGE negative for me.

Reading cards from the marketplace is very hard to do without signaling your intentions to your opponents. 

As Millennium Blades is a Level99 Games release, I’m VERY wary of it, so perhaps I won’t buy it until next year to see if they release the deluxe edition (or just a new edition) with a new set of rules that makes this one obsolete.

Bottom line, kudos to Level99 Games for publishing games that are very novel and unique, however, I’m not sure if Millennium Blades is for me. At first I loved the concept, but the game isn’t very fun to play. Getting it to the table isn’t easy and my SO dislike this kind of game. I need to play more times to see if I will buy it but if I do it will be at least a year from now (due to Level99 Games policies on changing rules). Right now, Millennium Blades is a 5.5 for me, it is an ok game to play from time to time but that’s not enough to get to know all the cards. Way too long for what it offers.

Such an ambitious idea, and it actually works. I'm very impressed with the design.

The game has quite a bit of depth and a lot of card text to become familiar with. It will take a few games to get comfortable with everything. As such it isn't a game that's well suited to being played once or twice a year, or constantly being introduced to new players. So it doesn't suit my needs well. 

If you have the time/group to enjoy this with and you like the idea of the game you probably won't be disappointed.

Originally I was heavily doubting the concept and therefore I was positively surprised at how well this catches certain aspects of ccg life. I think that by default the biggest challenge of this one is that deckbuilding / collecting phase can be too long. However, at the same time the real time play between tournaments is fun and tense and the tournaments can include very comboing.

There it is. My first real 10 / 10 for a game (instead of an expansion, which was already snatched by Carcassonne: Inns & Cathedrals). Honestly? This is my favorite game in my collection, and I mean that. Every time I play it, win or lose, I want to play it again and fix whatever I messed up last time, but also play it completely differently because maybe a completely crazy play will pay off big. I love the theme, obviously, but I also love the clear effort put into making this game. It’s the feeling you get when you see someone’s like, magnum opus, and it’s an incredible product, from the uncountable number of unique art assets to the literally bajillion cards to the actual stacks of money I spent three hours putting together like some kind of bank teller fever dream. Sure, it’s a long game, and of course, it has some random elements, but that’s part of what makes the game incredible — the random elements are just you ducking and weaving whatever the game throws at you over a long enough sequence for you to go from “what the heck are even these cards” to “I have a super cohesive strategy that I’ve been planning for a while; this tournament’s in the bag” to the obvious “how the heck did I even lose that tournament?”. The game’s an absolute masterpiece of fun, thematic gameplay, and I would overwhelmingly recommend it to pretty much anyone that is willing to listen to me gush about it.

Had hoped to love this.  Did not.  

Card play seemed both overly complicated (keeping track of what everyone had in play to make the right move) and overly simplistic (make my "deck" of 8 cards with a more-or-less preset order of playing the cards to maximize their effects, very occasionally messed up by another players card play - generally without intend to hamper me (or others) but simply to play their cards in the optimal order.

Add in the weird real-time trading, upgrading, buying/selling, and set collecton it often felt like spending points and hoping to get lucky...and often failing.

As the game went on, an ever increasing list of questions with regards to timing came up (none of which were covered by the rulebook - and much of the time was spent looking through a 5 page FAQ here.

*shrug*

Some games are complex and really justify spending the time to learn the intricacies to be able to get lots of long-term enjoyment out of them.  This does not seem to me to be one of these games.

It's clearly got fans - they will be better able to tell you what you might like about this.  I hope they enjoy it for years to come.  It simply isn't for me.

I was never really into collectible card games, but I had friends that were and I was excited to try out this CCG simulator. The game is very unique with a bit of real-time deck construction rounds where you are frantically buying and selling to find better cards or engage in a bit of set collection, playing the real-time rounds with a time limit is my preference. The tournaments are where your deck comes up against the other players and each player tries to gain the most points by making combos with the cards they play. Trying to find different synergies with card types is the best part of the game and there's so much variety in the game that it's very impressive. This is probably my favourite game that I don't own, and probably the best paper money ever (and I hate paper money).

RATING: 7
Tons of variability with hundreds upon hundreds of cards, of which you'll only see a fraction each playthrough. That said, my one experience with it wasn't altogether successful. I mean, I'm not sure whether I missed out on the breadth of gameplay by mostly sticking to cards in my starting deck that scored decent points and only adding a few cards to it through the market. Wasn't for lack of trying though. If the goal of the game was to simulate the CCG experience of 90% of blind buys being total rubbish, mission accomplished. Thus, it's a chore to find even three or four cards that work with your deck in the course of a game. But that's thematic, and kinda fun in a frustrating way. Ambitious, if a bit overwrought.

After a couple play-throughs the game has quite a bit of diversity and replayability but my qualm with it is the take-that cards in the game. The game gives you about half an hour to setup your deck and cards and a handful of ways to protect your strategy. The problem is there are a lot more ways for others to ruin the strategies you've devised.  There is an option to try to gain points by "collecting" cards but getting the cards you need to collect is based around luck of the draw, which in turn is limited to how much money you have.  It shakes down to a TON of work and input for a mediocre chance of success and little payout, only to have to repeat it again 3 times (for the 3 "tournaments" in game).

This is my favorite game already, and I think it will continue to be for the rest of my life. It hits all the sweet notes of playing a trading card game in the tournament scene for years in such a short span. It's incredible. Even my one friend who normally doesn't like playing games longer than 40minutes has been asking to play again and talking about it.

No other game has ever captivated my friends and me so much that we're constantly thinking of how we could've improved each phase so slightly. 

Also, the games are always pretty close-- tournaments aren't everything. Our player who usually scores last in tournaments has won and is constantly a contender at end game scoring through money and collections.

This truly is an amazing game and it comes insanely recommended.

Millennium Blades is a CCG-Simulator -- A game in which you play as a group of friends who play the fictional CCG "Millennium Blades".

In this game you will build decks, play the meta, acquire valuable collections, crack open random boosters, and compete in tournaments for prizes and fame. The game takes you from Starter Deck to Regionals in about 2-3 hours.

Multiple games can also be chained together to form a Campaign, going from Regionals to Nationals in game 2 and from Nationals to Worlds in game 3, with each game introducing ever more powerful cards and higher stakes, but also resetting the power of the game so that each player has a fair chance to win each 'season' of the campaign.

The tournament section has some vague similarities with Dominare for me, but I think the Dominare play is tighter and more interesting.

I think there's a fun game in the general concept, but it is a bit too loose and messy for my taste in the current execution. A more interesting market phase (would need to be significantly revamped) and a more dynamic tournament phase (this mostly comes down to card design and card pool, rather than the current system) would greatly improve it for me.

I just generally enjoy interactive games more though, and I think this one has a few of modern Euro stylings that aren't my cup of tea.

RATING: 8
FIRST IMPRESSION:

Really enjoyed this "simulation" of the meta game around CCGs in acquiring them and putting together sets, etc. The real time aspect of purchasing/trading cards and prepping your deck can make one feel rushed but needs to be present to make sure the game keeps moving along. I've only played the suggested beginner game which as preconstructed decks to start with a tournament which was helpful to see how those play out (each player plays a card in turn order six times and may take one action if there is one present on a card). However, the main game has you start drafting immediately and ignores starter decks (I believe). 

Setup and tear down is painful. One must mix together/separate 14-17 sets of cards (four players) . If everyone chips in, it isn't too difficult. Some of the key words seem redundant/un-necessary. Need to find a way to store cards in a better fashion (nothing really provided by Level 99 in the box.

This is a very clever game that is essentially an economic simulation in the world of a Yu-Gi-Oh spoof. If you have played any collectible card games you will be privy to the jokes and puns. It runs a little long, but you can just play the short game if that is an issue. A very unique experience!

RATING: N/A
"It isn’t necessarily balanced or fair or “tight,” in the sense that everything is perfectly fine-tuned and everyone is given equal opportunities. Sometimes, one player will buy amazing cards and totally sweep a tournament with hardly any trouble at all. Sometimes you’ll fuse nine cards for a single promo only to discover it doesn’t do jack for your deck."

"(about two player games) the decisions just aren't as hard because you aren't facing as many enemies."

"(2 player game) there is a heck of a lot more going on, and a lot more variety with more players. Also, if someone is using a very protected scoring deck, it may take two or more players to break through the defenses."

"I think 2 player is less preferred because...

1. It has a slightly different rule set (best 2 out of 3 tournament wins instead of highest points overall)
2. Fewer cards come out into/cycle through the aftermarket. So you're more at the whims of randomness. 
3. Trading is less common.
4. Combat is likely a little easier. Less chaotic/confrontational since there a fewer opponent cards coming out that can affect you"

"I like that aspect of improvisation, but it does seem to make the game a bit too random and shallow at first glance. I suspect as you get more familiar with the booster packs and what kind of synergies you might see, that part of the game might fade to the background. When you have no clue what the cards might contain, you’re completely flying by the seat of your pants. Again, this is fine and enjoyable, but it doesn’t make for a great game. I’d love for there to be more strategic decisions vis a vis your deck and your opponent’s decks. The mini-metagame that is already there is fantastic, and I’d love for it to be based around strategic rather than purely improvisational deckb"

"Setup, tear-down, table space, rules expalanations are all rather long for what it is."

"I think it would shine with 3-4. But I'm not sure how often I'd suggest it -- especially since the theme is so niche (and, at least with this game, the theme is a real driving force in the game's drive.)"

"Not sure why this one is rated so high. The card collecting part is fun, the combat system is awful, 8 and 2 respectively. So I love half of this game, as it's clearly split into parts."

* Notes
- Setup too long (deck of 300 cards to assemble and shuffle)
- Simulated games too simplistic
- High luck factor in the draws
- Many people find that it's hard to put on the table. I am guessing that it is not good enough, really.
- Shuffling the big starting deck and putting it up is a pain. 
- Some very defensive decks require two players to go through
- I do not like the variance in Pixel Tactics so much: maybe I would feel the same here.
+ Nice real-time deck building tension.
- 2 hours!
$ The two player game misses a few things (see thread) but seems to be fine anyway.
- 15 % don't like it with 2 (20 votes).
+ Buying cards, swapping cards, building a deck for the next match… sounds cool

RATING: 2.5
Wow this was painful to play.  This takes the worst parts of MTG and makes a game out of it.  There was little player interacton during the deck construction phase... everyone just looking down at their cards and not talking.  Since each player can only have a certain number of cards in the secondary market, it quickly gets clogged with cards no one wants.  Then you have to buy packs... and you don't know what your going to get... so you end up with loads of cards you don't want or need... the promo trades don't help much either since they are blind picks as well.  So after about 14 mins of silence, you go to a tournament and you each play six cards...  what a pathetic pay-off for all that building.  Then you do it all again.... and again!

Only redeeming factors are the pop culture references on the cards and the hilarious stacks of money... but both of those get old quick.
I also acknowledge that this game is different and tries something totally new.

This game is very difficult to rate. It is the first game that tries to give you a feel of playing TCG while not just giving you a TCG like game. It puts a lot of emphasis on trading/ buying/ selling/ opening packs that gives you a very unique TCG-like experience. At the end of the game, while facing with all those useless cards in my binder, I did have some flashbacks while I am organising my WoWTCG/ old MTG collection.
The time limit is also brilliant. Otherwise players would just spend infinite time just try to make a deal with other players.
However, the major downside is that this game TAKES SUPER LONG TIME TO SETUP AND CLOSE DOWN. You need to choose which expansions to play, then shuffle the pile of cards which approaches 300. After gameplay you then need at least 20 mins to sort them back again. 1 of my groupmates thought that this game would be much better if goes digital, initially I thought he's correct, however later I believe the actual feel of getting hold of lots of cards (many of them are useless to your deck) helps a lot in making this game thematic. Not to mention the stacks of paper money!
BTW, I think this game is in serious need of card dividers. L99, publish one together with the next expansion!

A truly unique game that plays unlike anything I've ever seen. The fact that it works is incredible, but the fact that it works so well is astounding! The rules are simple and flow naturally, the card powers are self-explanatory, and the options are limitless. I haven't even received the expansion yet and I can't imagine playing enough to see all the cards. 

The deck building phases are the star of the game...20 minutes never felt so short. There are hundreds of potential combos and ways to score points that you always have options. The addition of collective sets adds one more challenge to the mix.

The tournaments are fast and fun. They combine your ability to combo your own cards while countering your opponents and planning to prevent their actions on you.

I don't play CCGs, but MB is incredibly fun!

Level 99 seems to have a way for making the perfect games for me with almost infinite replayability. BattleCON and Argent are near perfect games in their genre for me, and Millennium Blades continues this trend.

Millennium Blades is a boardgame CCG ecosystem in a box, and seems like one of the most unique gameplay experiences to come out.
 
A simulation of a CCG(think Magic: The Gathering) ecosystem where in a real-time 20 minute phase the players buy, sell, trade ccg cards, to build their collections and create the best decks they can for the current season of tournaments. Being able to manage your time to accomplish all these tasks in daunting at first but become easier after a couple sessions. 

There is no other game like this one. It is so unique, accomplishes what it sets out to do, and is just so darn fun.

RATING: 3.5
A CGC simulation is a great idea. But, one of the wonderful parts of a deckbuilder is knowing your cards, knowing how they all interact, and building a deck with multiple uses because you know your deck inside and out. I like the buying and selling portion of the game, but you have to decide between dozens of cards on the fly, having never seen them before. I find it much too hard to decipher all the interactions and build a deck on the fly with random cards. For me, this is just an exercise in frustration. The buying, selling, and trading is fun, but my decks are always horribly cobbled together and I have no idea what others are throwing down. I only play because the work group LOVES this game. I dislike it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Captures the feel and fun of a sealed CCG event without burning an entire day going through all of the work.

The sheer number of options and building can be overwhelming and the real-time mechanics make it hard to keep a check on the happenings on the table, which means cheating (inadvertent or not) is more common than I like in a game of this type.

Also, this is a hard sell to players who don't play or have no interest in the games this one pays homage to.

Long play time, beast of a set up, but I love it.

Prefer it at 2 players variant how your collection starts of your RP for the upcoming game and its best 2 out of 3 wins. It just streamlines the game - haveing to think of VP vs Rp is really confusing. The fact you can come 1at place in 2 tournaments and then loose to a player who came second always but made good collections

This was alright. It has a few issues, but I overall liked the game. It honestly feels that tournaments are a little too much of the scoring system. I won my first game by winning all three tournaments. I did some collections and money points, but nowhere near as many as other people, and I steamrolled in victory points at the end.

What a crazy game!
Realtime deck-construction dueling game. This is an abomination that should not work, but simply does!

The hectic nature of this as a realtime game adds a nice and adrenaline-filled flavor to it.

There are infinite ways to combine and create decks and doing so in a random fashion while playing makes it infinitely replayable.

I'm not sure about the length of the game, seems like it could be streamlined a bit.

Keeping track of the score is a bit messy with the high numbers that keeps adjusting up and down constantly, and with the markers so easy to be bumped around it's easy to lose track of it.

Overall a great and completely unique game that has so much to offer!

To resume, really liked the game: 
 :)- The theme is very well implemented, you really feel like you are building a deck for a Tournament 

 :)- You get that excitement of buying a pack and expecting to find a specific type of card in it (the back of the cards display some probabilities of what the card can be).

 :)- The specific Player Powers

 :)- The Aftermarket where you sell cards that you won't use to get some money to buy boosters from the Store

 :)- The Paper Money! Really, the Paper Money is AWESOME... the Stacks of bills with a money strap on it are amazing and really give a fantastic feel to the game with people throwing them around and picking them up

 :)- The Art of the cards

 :)- The Humor of the Flavor Text on the cards

 :)- Insane amount of replayability in the game due to the huge amount of decks and cards that you only use a part of in each game

 :)- Very Good Production from [b][company=11752][/company][/b]

 :soblue: Setup Time will be painful
 
 :soblue: Tear Down time will also be painful
 
 :soblue: The Real Time element of the Deck-Building part can be stressful, specially in the preparation for the first Tournament because you have no experience with the game and you'll be overwhelmed with the amount of cards in hand, in the store, etc...

 :)/:soblue: The game is prone to some negative interaction between the players if they want to be confrontational... there are some accessories that can mess with the Tableau of other players, there are cards you play that will affect negatively the other players, you can even Clash with an opponent (make a battle with the most right card in the players tableau and the winner/loser will be able to get some points and mess with the other player cards for example)

RATING: 4
During the 20-minute deck-building phase players randomly draw cards trying to put together a synergistic hand of 11 cards.  That's 20 minutes of reading card effects & icons, evaluating these effects and comparing them to each other and to a tableau of face-up cards.  You are limited in how many cards you can draw, so each draw is really important: but it is usually just a blind draw of a face-down card. Which means you don't have a lot of control over your deck-building.

The second phase is a "tournament", where you reveal the hand you built one card at a time to get points.  The cards effects are few and simple and mostly just boil down to points: this card gets me 12 points, this one 15, this one 30, this one 45.  That's it: play a card, get some points.

This is repeated 3 times.  The draw phase gives the illusion of control to a situation where you are really just randomly drawing cards.  It feels like it's too much effort for too little reward.  Also, the constant reading at different depths gave me a terrible eye-strain headache.

Das Konzept von Millenium Blades liest sich im ersten Moment wie ein schlechter Scherz. Die Spieler sind Spieler...von Sammelkartenspielen. Es gilt sich eine Kartensammlung aufzubauen, Booster zu kaufen, ein Deck zu erstellen und damit Turniere zu gewinnen. Dort erhält man seltene und mächtige Promokarten. Durch den Verkauf von eigenen Karten, erhält man Geld, um neue Booster zu kaufen. 
Moment mal....jeder der schon einmal ein Sammelkartenspiel wie Magic:the Gatherin, Yu-Gi-Oh oder Pokemon gespielt hat, wird jetzt etwas verdutzt dreinschauen. Doch dies ist kein Scherz: Millenoum Blades ist wirklich Simulator für Sammelkartenspiele und tatsächlich ist es absolut grandios. Das Spiel kommt mit einer wahren Masse an Karten daher, so dass man fast erschlagen wird. Aus dieser Kartenmasse stellt man sich die Karten/Editionen/Boostersets zusammen, mit denen man spielen will. Jede Runde besteht aus zwei Phasen. Einer Echzeitphase, in der die Spieler Karten kaufen, verkaufen und ihr Deck optimieren und einer Turnierphase, in der die Spieler gegeneinander antreten. Der Sieg in einem Turnier bringt Siegpunkte, ebenso wie das Sammeln einer beeindruckenden Kartenkollektion. Nach drei Runden gewinnt der Spieler mit den meisten Siegpunkten. Die Mechaniken in Millenium Blades sind großartig und greifen perfekt ineinander. Die Echzeitphase ist hektisch, aber macht einfach nur Spaß und verfliegt im Nu (immerhin 20 Minuten). Die Turniere sind toll interaktiv und teilweise auch destruktiv, so wie bei einem richtigen Sammelkartenspiel. Die Illustrationen der Karten sind super, natürlich im Animestil, aber immer stimmig und passend. Und wer sich nur ein bisschen im Bereich Anime, Sci-Fi und allgemein Popkultur auskennt, wird etliche witzige Anspielungen finden. Zusätzlich bietet Millenium Blades eine Vielzahl an alternativen Regeln und Modifikationen. Zum Beispiel gibt es unterschiedliche Charaktere (Avatare) mit individuellen Fähigkeiten oder man duelliert sich in einer Arena, die Sonderregeln mit sich bringt. Dazu kommen kleine Details, wie echtes Papiergeld, dass zu Bündeln gepackt wird, womit man die Karten/Booster kaufen darf. Am Ende bleibt zu sagen: Millenium Blades ist mit Sicherheit nicht für jeden Spieler geeignet. Aber wer (so wie ich) auch nur etwas mit Sammelkartenspielen zu tun hat, der ist hier im 7. Himmel!

I enjoy the frantic real time element of attempting to construct a deck. The tournament phase is also good but I think it is too easy to win with a SCORE heavy deck. I've tried experimenting with some flip effects and clashing but they in no way generate as many points as SCORE cards do.

I think exploring the different card sets might change that but it will most likely take a long time to get through all that content, especially because LVL99 was quite generous with the amount of different cards offered in the game.

A truly unique and enjoyable experience. As someone who once collected CCGs, this really feeds that inner desire of building a deck from cards I buy blindly. I like that the game is mostly real time, but can easily be house-ruled to not be so. And there is SO much variety. This is just an amazing achievement with both how ambitious it is and what it manages to accomplish. There are a few parts that are clunkier than I'd like, which is why I don't rate it higher, but it's still a mainstay in my collection.

Excellent game.  The theme hit me perfect as a form MTG player.  The amount of content you get in the box (with an expansion coming later this year) is amazing.  What I like most is how it took deck building (my favorite part of playing MTG) and turned it into  a timed competition.  The game is a win for me on numerous levels and I cannot wait to get it back to the table.  If I had to give one negative, it would be the setup and tear down time, which makes Legendary Marvel's setup time look fast by comparison.  Otherwise this game is a top shelf title for me and one any CCG fan should take a look at.

I knew that I was going to love this game based on concept alone. As a Yugioh player for many years, this type of game was looking to be one that hit on all the right notes.

Although it's only been one game, the feel of it is near perfect. The build up in the deck-building phase is awesome. You feel the timer depleting each of the three mini-rounds. It's a great feeling to watch your deck come together in the middle of a tourney (or watch it crumble when you misplay or misread a card). Getting a strategy and starting your deck from scratch is frantic and hilarious, especially when you dump every card from your previous deck. And funny moments are created, like opening with the same card every time from your starter deck.

My biggest complaint is the set-up and tear-down, but the fun and design outweighs that downfall. I also think the organization with 5 players can get really messy. I'm also finding that having just 6 starting decks limits the first tourney. So I'm hoping Set Rotation fixes that.

RATING: 5
"This will either be the greatest game of 2016, or the greatest disappointment.  Calling it now." -- May 23, 2015

It's a strong contender for the latter, and not because it's a horrible, irredeemable game.  It's... first off, it's NOT a CCG simulator.  AT ALL.  It's a draft cube of a lopsided, weirdly asthmatic, 1st-gen Pokemon CCG knock-off.  Calling it a simulator because you incorporate a 20min trading and buying round is a joke.

Again, the game is not bad, per se.  But it's a complete and utter shitshow with no easy entry point even with the pre-constructed decks, and it will take players MANY plays to even partially 'grok' how tournament strategies warp and weave around the required 12 expansion packs incorporated with each game.  Let's face it: If you can't grasp what you're aiming to synergize, you can't build a strategy around it.  I can learn and understand a core set of cards over time.  But learning a core set + 12 expansions (out of a possible 50, each with their own potential influence on the game) is a non-starter in a gamer culture that plays a game once and moves on.  This isn't Cosmic Encounter, where a new alien changes things slightly.  It radically reinforms the way you must play, and it's too much.

And it's a shame because somewhere in this shitshow is a decent game, but between the art (bad even by L99 standards, and the worst I've seen since Catacombs 2nd ed) and the complexity required in knowing the initial card set I imagine only the most stalwart fans will return.

We will see what the rest of 2016 looks like, but yeah: Strong early contender for biggest disappointment.  Given its hype, though, it had nowhere to go but down.

Though the setup / initial shuffling can be tedious, this game is worth it. It really does capture the feel of being a serious CCG enthusiast. I favor the Liquidation optional rule where players sell their entire deck after each tournament to encourage more deckbuilding and card turnover.

The game itself is aquite fun and a wonderful tongue in cheek look at pop culture and the world of CCG's

Unfortunately the rule book is badly laid out and even with the index in the back there are things that are not explained well.  Or things referenced without having a clear way to fin them.

RATING: 3
This game of the epitome of "too much going on". Setup takes forever, no pay off. It's also completely random. Yes, it's thematic. Yes, it feels like playing a CCG, BUT there's so many things that don't make sense in relation to theme. Why do cards reference the marketplace? Doesn't make sense. The actual CCG game you play within this game is just not very fun. Overly simplistic. Someone could get an amazing card from the luck of the draw, and then you have to pray in your time limit you will find a card to counter it. Probably not going to happen. Then the rest of the game on top of that game, is just not that fun either. I hate the timed aspect of it although I understand why they did it thematically. The ONLY thing that I really liked about the game was the whole "Meta" aspect where each tournament had a chosen meta to the game, super thematic. Brilliant idea. The rest of the game was good ideas executed poorly. I understand people love this game but I didn't enjoy it for a single solitary second. If I wanted to have the experience of playing a CCG, I would just play a CCG!

Millennium Blades is a game that attempts to simulate the life of a collectible card game player.  The game features a number of timed "deckbuilding" phases in which players first acquire a bunch of random cards, and then can get more cards by buying face-down cards from the store, buying face-up cards from the singles market, or even trading directly with other players.  To earn more money, players can sell cards to the singles market, but players are limited in the number of cards they can sell.  At the end of each of these periods, players must come up with a "deck" of 8 cards for the tournament, as well as a "collection" of differently-numbered cards with the same color or symbol that provides increasing points.  During the tournament itself, players play their cards in any order and exploit combos to try to score as many points as possible.  This is a game where all of the cards have lots of text and most of them are different from one another, so building up card combinations is very interesting and varied.  While I can definitely see the appeal, the game felt a little too frantic for my tastes, and I couldn't really execute on the trading at all.  This is a game I'd play again, but it leaves me pretty exhausted.

Minor Update: A few more plays of it and I'm still not in love with it. I enjoy it the more that I play it, but it still doesn't excite me like I thought it would. A minor strategy tip is to start crafting your deck VERY roughly early after a few buys and to leave it till much later (like the last round before the tournament) to fine tune it. I found that the last 6 minutes often were not used fully due to us already having a deck premade. I felt I made stronger decks when I waited until later to craft them. Focus a bit around the deck box, especially if it doesn't have a point cap.If it does, use that as a base and focus more on the cards generating points. 30 RP is not that much and can often be done with a single card.

How do I feel about this game? It's the metagame around a fake CCG. You have 20 minutes each round to build/trade/sell and yet it still doesn't feel like you have enough time. The first game of this was very, very overwhelming as each card has unique text and you've got your starter set, plus 3 store cards, plus 6 more, plus in 7 minutes here's 6 again, not to mention any of the cards you've bought, cards on the market and what you should even be doing in a tournament. With repeat plays, I could see this going up rating wise in my head, but holy hell, I was swimming in the deep end.

There are hundreds of cards (and double that once you add in all the promo and expansion content) and you're left with a ridiculous amount of replayable content. My biggest gripe is the setup as you need to mix up a TON of different sets and make sure its shuffled well. A bit hard to do without sleeves, especially since sleeving it will cost as much as the entire game.

Game can go a bit long, especially with the max player count and I think 3-4 players is probably the ideal amount. 2 was perfectly fine, but the sheer lack of trading and the non focus on VP made it adequate, yet not as fun as the higher player counts.

Includes all additional promo and kickstarter content (Promo packs #1-5) as well as Meeple Realty insert.

It certainly isn't very interactive (even when playing with the cards that let you interact with others -- i.e. ones that do clashes or with flip effects). That said, I think it is quite unique both in terms of gameplay and theme. I think the theme does come across quite well here. 

I think it would shine with 3-4. But I'm not sure how often I'd suggest it -- especially since the theme is so niche (and, at least with this game, the theme is a real driving force in the game's drive.)

I love everything about this game. The deck building aspect really nails what it's going for- it feels just like I'm putting together a CCG deck for a tournament. The artwork is great. The components are great. To top everything else off, you get SO MUCH for what you pay. Cannot recommend this one enough.

RATING: 8
This game is a bit of a flipluck mess, but I can't deny that the theme and the mechanisms combine into an incredibly appealing package. Essentially the goal of the game is to get the best set of 6-8 cards you can, while simultaneously collecting cards that have matching attributes for the purposes of trashing them to score points at the end of the rounds for set collection.

 During the deckbuilding rounds, you throw wads of money away on blind luck pulls from facedown assortments of cards.  This hits way too close to home for me in theme, since in my misspent youth I used to be one of those CCG players the game parodies. At least in this game, the back of the card has some hints as to what sorts of things you might be buying. The game also allows you to trash large piles of useless cards in exchange for overpowered "promo" cards. 

The game feels a little like Galaxy Trucker, in that you are creating this fragile mess and then hoping for the best. There's a ton of player interaction as during the tournament phases when you play those 6 cards one by one and resolving their effects, often times other player's effects will mess up your carefully laid combos. As it's impossible to keep track of what everyone is getting every turn, this has a random feel to it. You play several rounds, each round improving your setup more and more, as the value of winning the tournament rounds increase. It's very possible to get hammered early and make a huge last turn comeback. Very compelling, very enjoyable game.

A game that really perfectly streamlines a simulation of the experience of playing a CCG, complete with building complex interactions using a nebulous content pool of hundreds of cards, and spending currency in the hopes you get cards you can use. If that inexplicably appeals to you, then look no further than this game.

HARD PASS

I think that this game does what it does really well.

I just hate what it does.

RATING: 8
A game which plays much better than it sounds.

It is a game about the meta-game of CCGs. You spend your allowance and trading to build collections of cards to score points. Also to build a deck to win a tournament. Objects that can can work at cross purposes. Many purchases are made blind in the hopes you can get something useful or by keeping an eye on what people are selling. The use of a timer to make your purchase, trades, assemble the deck really drives the tension. 20 minutes split into 3 "rounds" is not as much time as you think. 

The "tournament" is simple you play 6 rounds of cards along with being able to take a action. Straight forward but there is some capablilites of combinations, passive or agressive decks.

I played with some guys who took forever to play. I would probably prefer this one at 2-3 instead of 4-5. I played this game for 4 hours. Honestly for me, I only have a common understanding of all the meta that goes into customizable card games. So, while I get a lot of the meta jokes, some of it goes over my head. Therefore, the theme and all is not a grand slam for me. There is so much to contemplate in this game, I would definitely need more plays. But, this one definitely has promise if you can get it down to 2 hours. I put it at a 7 for now because I appreciate the game, and what they are trying to accomplish. I would say that if you love the CCG scene and you like deckbuilding then you will probably enjoy this one.

Another member of our gaming group backed this on KS (had he not done so there is a very good chance that I'd have done so myself), and since it arrived in late April I've already managed to play it three times. I really like the game, even though the real-time aspect is something that I'd usually shy away from - try to build both "collections" of matching cards *and* a deck that will function well in the tournament is great fun, as is trying to puzzle out which cards to take into the tournament, and then which order to play them in.

I'm not completely convinced that this game has a huge amount of staying power - although that will be helped by the ridiculous variety of cards included. But at the moment this is a game I pretty much always want to play.

Millennium Blades is an interesting idea and totally unique within games. One that I was eager to try out when I found one of the guys in our gaming group had picked it up!

Component wise, it's great. The box is big and sturdy. The Kickstarter bundles of money really make you think you're spending wads of cash on packs. The cards themselves are very nice quality and the artwork all through is just fantastic. The player boards, I think, are a little thin and flimsy - but that's a small complaint as everything else is top notch.

We all picked up the game concepts fairly easily from the guy who was explaining to us. The early part of the game is pretty simple. But then comes the chaos. You get 7 minutes to go crazy with your money, buying new cards or second hand ones that other players are selling - as well as putting up a limited amount of your own cards for sale. Checking out other players, to see if you can make trades with them. All the time, checking your new cards to see how they combo with your existing card pool. After you have all your new cards, its time to sit down and make a deck and a strategy with them - which is a lot trickier than it sounds. Finally, take your deck to a tournament and play against all the other players. Tot up all the scores, then move to the next tournament/final scoring.

Despite there being 5 players in our game, I did feel that a large part of this is a single player endeavor. While this is fine during the chaos period of getting new cards/putting your deck together - it is more of an issue for me during the tournament stage. My "deck strategy" was just about building up points - so I literally didn't care about what anyone else was doing with their decks. I had both the cards I wanted to play, and the specific order I was going to play them, all planned out before the tournament started. Even the players whose decks had interactions with other players - they did similar, just playing their cards in their own predefined order. This, I feel, is the biggest limitation to the game. There is too little going on in the tournament phase and there is no real reason to react to other players (often you don't bring a card that can). If you deviate from your own initial strategy, you're going to cost yourself more in the longer term. The cards are so combo-specific that you can't risk playing anything you haven't already budgeted for as it just costs you end points.

Overall, I did find the deckbuilding part of the game a lot of crazy fun. But I feel that the tournament play of the game does let the game down considerably and really needs something done to improve it. So it's a game I'd probably try again, but wouldn't rush to get it myself.

Amazing game with LOTS of replayability.  Its only fault is its initial setup time (sleeved 700+ cards and making the money stacks took 4 hours).  I plan to have lots of hours playing this game in the future, and plan to be doing a review video soon.  If you love puns and parodies, this is great for you on a flavor end alone.

I enjoyed it, but I'm not sure how often I want to play it.  It might be something I just want to play 1-3 times and be done, or only play ever 5-10 years.  But I did fine it quite a fun experience.  It's not too complex for what it is, but it may be too long for what it is.

If the game were a bit shorter, it might get up as high as 8/10.

I'd like to try the variant where you deck is liquidated after every tournament, thereby forcing you to experience more decks and do more deckbuilding, which is the fun part,.

This is unique and amazing, games within games going on in this one big box of hundreds of cards.  There's not much out there to compare it to, so I'd recommend to most people to try the game if possible.  For me, the game is pretty ideal; I don't mind a long playtime or the presence of some real-time phases in a game, which are two of the few potential issues with the game.  Level-99 Games always impresses me with how much they pack in the box, seemingly reserving nothing for expansions (though expansions are on the way after all!).  The setup and teaching time are worth it for me, for sure.  The only people who I fear are certain not to enjoy this one are those who struggle with or don't like to learn rules.  It's not that the rules are particularly hard to understand, but rather that there are so many of them, so many cards to read.  Some people will love that, and others will begin to feel very tired very quickly upon beginning to learn this game.

RATING: 8
This game is completely unlike anything else I own.  It's a board game about simulating the complete experience of playing a competitive collectible card game.  It alternates between real-time rounds where you simultaneously buy random packs, buy and sell cards to the aftermarket, trade with other players, learn about the metagame for the upcoming tournament, build your deck for the tournament, and build a collection of cards to display for points.  Then, you have a turn-based tournament where you actually play the CCG with the decks and receive points based on your standing in the tournament.  The entire game is over-the-top ridiculous, from the parody cards to the accessories you can bring to give you an edge to the money physically being thick wads of bills that demonstrate how expensive it is to play a CCG.  The real-time aspect makes it somewhat stressful and not everyone's cup of tea, but I definitely want to play again.  Setup is a bit of a chore, what with needing to pick out thirteen different sets of cards of varying power levels and shuffling them into a massive deck of about 300 cards.  It does a really great job of capturing the feel of being a Magic player.

Way too long a setup time for what ended up being an OK simulacrum of a CCG.  CCG gameplay was not that deep and buying and selling had a fair degree of randomness.  I'm sure that would fix itself if we played enough and really learned the decks, but the sheer absurdity of the setup and takedown time meant that we never wanted to play this game enough to get really into it.

- Set up/tear down time can be a bear
- Can lead to some AP with plethora of options, but real time element helps combat a lot of it

Millennium Blades takes a lot of mental energy and has a lot of random factors, but it's an absolute blast to play. It's an extremely thematic experience that will appeal to people that like the gameplay elements of ccg's, but don't necessarily want to spend the time and money it takes to get into and stay involved in those games. Due to the high mental energy/time investment required to play the game combined with the random factors, I don't want to play Millennium Blades all the time, but when I do I really enjoy it.

Very cool, innovative game. Need a few more plays to rate properly. I love the cards and all the mechanics, but with all the interaction between different combos there are sometimes things that are unclear in the rules, which makes the game less satisfying. With more plays, that would probably go away.

Also apparently I'm terrible at this game.

Millennium Blades does a great job at capturing the feel of playing a CCG. This game is so smart in how it abstracts things. There is a lot of abstraction in this game, but it still delivers the feel of what it is simulating. This keeps the game from bogging down and makes it fairly easy to play. I really love the variety this game has. There are so many different cards available to create the store deck that it has a high level of replayability. For me this game is a huge success. It delivers exactly what it says it does in a near perfect way. This is a game that simulates playing a lifestyle game in two hours, it turns out this is the kind of game I have always wanted.

Had lots of fun even though half the players were too out of it to even understand many of the basic concepts. Everyone had a blast playing it and no one was even thinking about things like "Okay, if I do this then I'll gain this many VP and that will cost this person that many VP and I'll have this much better chance of winning, etc. etc. etc."

It was just people thinking "Hey, this card looks awesome" and "Oh, if I play this I'll gain score which might make me win the tournament"

I have actively avoided getting into any collectible or living card game due to the financial and time requirements.  Typically, those types of games cost a lot of money to acquire all of the necessary cards as well as require a lot of time hunt down those cards, build decks to play, and learn about the various strategies.  While those types of games are definitely interesting, I just can’t commit the necessary resources.  However, imagine if it was possible to distill the entire CCG experience into a single game that doesn’t require any more than what’s already in the box… Well, that’s exactly what Millennium Blades provides and it does so in a BIG way.  There are a TON of cards in the box to the point that I have played twice now with different sets of cards and still haven’t even used all of the cards.  I can’t fathom the amount of time and effort that must have gone into the creation of this game!  I was most apprehensive about the real time acquisition/trade/build portion of the game, but it works surprisingly well and adequate time is provided to get the job done.  The tournament portion of the game is pretty fun as well, but it can drag a bit as players try to optimize their turns.  I have had fun playing this game, but a full game with four players takes several hours to play which is a bit more time that I’d usually like to commit to a game.  Frustration can also become an issue since each round builds on the previous and while there is an opportunity to improve your deck and strategy for the next round, it may already be too late catch the leader who probably already has a superior deck and is tuning it further with each round as well.  There is a gameplay variant in which the tournament decks are trashed each round, but I haven’t yet tried it to see if it improves the gameplay dynamic in a favorable way.  Overall, there is a lot happening at once during this game and it is very tactical.  Millennium Blades is an immersive experience and a unique game that I will probably never be good at playing!

For those that no longer have an interest in LCG and CCG style games this is the solution.  You have the itch to get into some money pit and instead you play this and all that compulsion is satisfied.  This is the CCG tournament scene condensed to a game that fits in a single 2 hour play roughly.  The art and geek culture references are great and the game is unique in how things come together.  Maybe niche but if you were ever interested in CCG this is a game you should try.

Where to start with this gem of a game. It is truly novel. We definitely don't have anything like this in our collection. A CCG simulation with tons of character and great artwork. Immersive theme complements solid real-time deck building and card collection mechanisms. Love the player character powers and how they can guide you down very different paths. Tournaments, while not quite as fun as the real-time deck building, are still a blast. Can play a little long, but can't wait to return to this one. Bucks the trend of thin content base games, providing an immense number of cards and possible setups. Still, backed for the expansion and am looking forward to seeing what it adds.

I love this game but it is so difficult for me to get to the table.  It requires a specific subset of my gaming group and no others to be around as it is a lengthy game.  Everyone else who has played it loves it too.  Will be very sad to see it go.

Collectible Card Game Simulator, affectionately called "Yugioh, the Euro Game" by my group.  The game takes place over several cycles - each containing a timed deckbuilding phase and a tournament phase - and allows multiple paths to victory, whether it's through building collections, forging friendships, or winning at tournaments.  The setup is kind of annoying, but the gameplay is very solid and, as expected from Level99 Games, the content is staggering.  

At the end of the day, the game evokes a general sense of "a bunch of friends who decided to get into a new CCG and spent way too much money on new cards."  It's a truly nostalgic feeling.

Full disclosure: Kickstarter backer.

The game does a good job with it's overall theme of simulating CCG collecting/building/tournament play and it can be pretty intense since you have to make some decisions fairly quickly and if you make a mistake you are stuck with it for the round. My friends and I enjoyed it quite a bit. It can take up a lot of table space however.

The puns and easter eggs in the game are quite awesome.

This game brings you back to your childhood. If you watched TCG animes as a kid (or still do), if you loved to open packs of TCG games for the fun and lottery effects than you're going to love this game. This game gives you all the fun of opening hundreds of packs of cards and creating amazing decks to become the tournament champion without breaking the bank. Trade the cards with your friends or sell the cards in the aftermarket, give your buddy friendship to sweeten the deal or fuse a bunch of your cards to get a sweet epic card, it's up to you. The amount of cards adds up to a TON of replayability and variety. Do yourself a favor and pick up this game if you want to go back to those golden Saturday morning cartoon days. Or if you just want to have a strategic blast, either way you'll be in for a good time.

One thing I have to give Level 99 is that when they release a game they release enough content for you to play that game until the end of time.  I have Pixel Tactics and Sellswords and both have enough content that every game is variable and different (you could say the same for their biggest game, BattleCON, mountains of cards).  The same goes for this, a game about playing a player of a collectible card game.  You with me?

This game is about being a professional player of a card game.  Each round has two phases.  A deckbuilding phase where you open new booster packs, sell and buy cards in the aftermarket, trade with other players and construct decks and valuable collections.  And also a tournament phase where you actually play your constructed deck against the other players to win prizes and fame (victory points).  Like I said above, there is so much content here (and I don't even have the expansion yet) that each game can be very different and have different strategies.  Both in the deckbuilding and tournament phases.

I found this game to be very thematic.  As someone who has played a lot of Magic: The Gathering and other CCGs a lot of the satire and references really hit home with me and I loved it.  The art is all gorgeous and once you understand what you are doing the game which has a lot of moving pieces is actually really smooth.  I actually did horrible in my first play because I was too quick to completely get rid of cards I wasn't using but quickly recognized what I did and would play very differently in the future.

My biggest criticism of this game is that set up and tear down is a bitch.  If you want to play with the same sets of cards every time or even a few times in a row it isn't too terrible.  But with all this content where is the fun in that?  So you have to shuffle together several "expansion" decks with the core deck and separate them out every game otherwise.  Not to mention that this creates a monster of a store deck (especially if you sleeve which I did).  With all these cards that need to be separated the lack of an insert is a big disappointment.  I immediately had to go on line and spend another 30 bucks for one.  Worth it but again disappointing since it is almost essential.

Considering what this game has on offer I consider those reasonably minor criticisms.  In the end this is one of my new favorite games, I wanted to play again immediately after it was over but it is about a 2 hour game so that wasn't really...in the cards!

Early rating from 1 game. Could change dramatically with more plays, but I'm rating on the lower side right now.

Game is VERY chaotic but captures the feel of chaos and unknown that you get from a TV show of Yu-Gi-Oh extremely well. Need to try it with experienced players and with fewer people (so the downtime isn't so long).

My biggest problem with the game is some swingy nature of getting really strong cards randomly, the "take that elements" that can be a king maker in some situations, and the chaos of the game. It is really hard to actually plan and build a deck since there's so many cards and some people can just get insane combos that work together. Still, it is a very neat game that captures the feel and I do want to play it again.

Millennium Blades is not a CCG (or even an LCG), yet it is about playing CCGs. It runs you through the whole experience of being an aspiring pro-player, starting with preconstructed decks and building your way up to a world tournament, all within the span of two hours, all contained within a single boardgame box. 

The concept itself can be confusing at first, so it might be surprising to find that Millennium Blades executes on it very well. The game-within-a-game is a fun little exercise in its own right. It doesn't have the same aggressive gameplay as your usual CCG but is instead a more euro-like point engine builder. Even so, in the variety of cards you can already find recognizable CCG archetypes - the straightforward points rush decks, the explosive combo decks, and the slow but disruptive control decks. And around that flows the true game: the game of buying pack after pack (with play money), hoping to open an all-powerful ultra-rare; of trading and selling your cards on the aftermarket; of sleeving ur Dragon collection to show off for VP; and of feverishly testing combination after combination of cards to build the best possible deck before the timer runs out and the tournament starts. 

Millennium Blades has a metric ton of variety, with mini-expansion after mini-expansion stuffed in the box. It also has the depth that such variety can bring in the hands of a skilled card designer. Level 99 Games has become my favorite publisher of late - their games are consistently amazingly, overflowingly excessive yet flawlessly designed. Millennium Blades is no exception. It's a love letter to the experience of being that aspiring CCG player and I just love it right back.

Loved the concept, but not happy at all with the execution. The deck building phase just feels like a mess. The "tournament" part is dull, missing out on all the interaction that makes CCGs fun. Cards are massive blocks of text that still aren't particularly exciting or interesting.

Fun? Yes, but stressful. I'm no big fan of the artwork, but the design works. I hear people say it's just like playing a CCG. Maybe if you are casually playing the CCG, buying a few boosters here and there and trying to cobble together a tournament ready deck. It doesn't feel like playing a CCG at a higher level than that. I like its frenetic pace, but I have to be in the right mood for it.

A "CCG Simulator". A fantastic emulation of the entire CCG/TCG experience. Players buy, sell, and trade cards during a timed phase to create an 8 card deck and "collections" (worth extra VP), then compete in a quick tournament round using their decks with VP being assigned out based on ranking. After 3 tournaments the game ends.

Uses bundled wads of paper money to give an authentic TCG feeling of tossing large amounts of money at cards.

Millennium Blades was interesting, but there was nothing in that first playthrough that told me I absolutely must get this for myself. I'd be willing to give it another few tries, but it feels flatter than, say, Argent, in terms of one's ability to compete directly with opponents instead of simply trying to build better. Part of it might be that it's hard enough to build a deck under time pressure already, never mind one that is resilient to other players' bullshit during the tournament phase.

Oddly enough I find myself wanting to play this again, though the strongest opinion I can muster for it is "It was okay." Hm.

Also, much like Argent, five players is entirely too many.

So very meta. The game is about deck building and then playing the deck in a tourney and then doing that a couple more times. It does this surprisingly well by focusing on the deck building fun of blind booster packs. The tourney play is quite straightforward, but not as simple as just laying out your cards (despite how it sounds). Some of the real joy comes from the crazy number of cards. After you spend 20 minutes shuffling all the boosters together, you'll have a stack that can be replayed a number of times without being "old". When you are bored of it, you can try with another combo of things and make the game brand new.

What an experience! When I sat down to play, I was overwhelmed and highly suspicious. I don't like the theme, I don't like the artwork, I don't like the play-time, I don't like the various interlocking but disparate phases, and I don't like the realtime aspects (or so I thought!). I started playing and resigned myself to suffering through the game. But then something funny happened. As the game moved along from phase to phase, I found myself (against my will) enjoying myself. By the end, I kind of wanted to play again. Every one of my complaints was somehow true, but despite those concerns the game won me over. I'm not seeking it out, and I don't have the dedication to delve into what I perceive to be the game's substantial depth, but I'd certainly play again if someone asked and I think I could highly enjoy the game with other casual players. Well done, Millennium Blades!

As someone that played a lot of Magic growing up, Millennium Blades felt very nostalgic.  It does a great job of capturing the feeling of opening packs and building decks.  I love deck construction in general (I am active in 3 LCGs at the moment), and this scratches that same itch.  The actual game that you play in the tournament is pretty basic, but I think that's a good thing.  There are a ton of cards and combos to make, so replayability is high.

I'm really digging it, but after 3 plays I don't think many other people want to play it much more.  The setup is pretty significant and the game takes up a lot of space.  I fear I won't get to play this more than 1 or 2 more times, but it's not for my lack of liking it.

Played this with 11 year old daughter; thought it would be too rough for her. In practice, it was enough to just allow her a bit of extra time to read her cards; she got all the other components right even though she had no prior experience in CCGs. This is a sign of the amazing work D Brad Talton Jr. and the rest of L99 do; Battlecon, Argent, and Pixel Tactics are by far the most common games played in our home.

The game reminded me of that. In fact that's 90% of what you do in the game. 
I like playing Magic and Dice Masters but only with suggested or pre-built decks. I have 0 desire to learn every card and combo out there and develop a deck based on it. That's essentially all you do in this game - buy and sell cards to build a deck then fight with it. Yuck and no thanks.

There are some pros and cons to this one, but the pros outweigh the cons.  Pros are the production value (fat stacks, yo), the well-captured theme of being a CCG junkie, the frenetic feeling of the timed phases, and the satisfaction of hitting a great card combo in the tournament phase.  Cons are the set-up time, the table footprint, and the fairly bewildering learning curve.  On balance, it's a good game that's pretty fun.

This stole the spot recently for my favorite game of all time... Think of Yugioh the show the game. It takes place in a world where a card game is so ubiquitous it's saturated all society, in part because it at one point was no mere game but a contest of magic summoning druids used to fight off aliens... You choose characters that fit into archetypes of characters from Yugioh and similar shows, and their varied (and awesomely dramatically play-strategy altering!) powers mesh wonderfully in terms of flavor and mechanics. The game then simulates a tournament in this card game. Note, you don't PLAY the card game, this game SIMULATES the game... Basically you alternate between a "deckbuilding" phase, and then a "tournament" phase where you simulate playing these decks against each other. The results of the tournament are the main source of victory points, but getting rare cards for your collection (think "rare drafting" if you play CCGs... you can bomb in the tourney and come out ahead if you pull moneycards in the draft), earning "Friendship" by agreeing to trades disadvantageous to yourself, squireling away cash, and other extraneous things also get points, and winning the game while losing the tourneys is possible.

This game is so fun and has so much replay, it blows my mind. Change characters, use different packs, field different cards, pursue different strategies. Still getting bored? Try adding the modifiers (CARD GAMES ON OSTRICHES). I don't know, maybe it's more just uniquely to my tastes than objectively great, but I can't get enough of this... SO good

Update: While the game is very unique, I ended up getting rid of it after two plays.

My biggest issue I suppose could be narrowed down to the amount of randomness. Someone can get a killer card combination early and sail to victory in each tournament with just slight modifications to their deck each time. So, just play to counter their awesome deck, you say? Well, that's where a lot of the randomness comes in. You can keep buying card after card, but sometimes you just don't get the right cards to counter somebody else, or even the right cards to make a decent deck yourself.

I believe that after many plays you could have a better understanding of which card sets you should buy in any situation (different card sets have their own flavor), but I'll never play enough to memorize all of them.

I love the idea of the game here, but with no real catch-up mechanic and no way to reliably bring down an "unbeatable" deck, the game feels like it could use a couple of tweaks.

Millennium Blades was a game that I had heard a bit about and was curious to try. In the game, you play a CCG player who is buying and selling cards so that they can construct decks and win CCG tournaments.

There's three tournaments, each preceded by a deckbuilding round. In the deckbuilding round, you get some cards randomly for free, and then you can buy and sell cards in the aftermarket (these are face up cards that usually get populated during the tournament phase) or buy cards from the store (which come face down). There's also a way to throw away a bunch of cards to get mega-cards. And there's a way to trash a set of cards for points.

The game is very clever, interesting and oh so meta. But this just isn't the game for me. I'm not a CCG player. It's not my favorite genre and I avoid it as much as I can. So most of the in-jokes went totally over my head.

And while I like card games, even things that look like CCG's, the thing that I find tiring about CCG's is the whole process of learning all the cards, and trying to construct a deck. I'm not particularly great at that, and it feels more like work than fun. And with a lot of these games, most of the "playing of the game" is actually in the deck construction. Actually playing the cards is simply a test to see how well you constructed your deck. And that's not really much of a game for me. So kudos to MB for simulating the CCG market well, but that's precisely why I didn't love this game. Also, the game was really long.

This really is a CCG Hobby simulator in a box.  So many cards and strategies to evaluate that it should remain fresh for years without an expansion--but expansions will come because a game built around CCGs has to have new sets, right?

You know how some games claim to really make you feel like you are, say, a pirate on the high seas, or an adventurer in a dungeon, or an entrepreneur in the Mediterranean, but you never really do, do you? It all just feels like shoving stuff around on a board on a table doesn't it?
Well Millennium Blades is that super-rare game that actually fully delivers on its promise. You really do feel like a CCG tournament player, buying cards and assembling the best deck you can, to take in and play in the next tournament. That's because...... well, you literally are doing just that! 
Even though the card-game-within-the-boardgame part is a bit simplistic, it works superbly within the context of the larger game, and there are still enough interesting deck builds to experiment with, from decks that destroy themselves to score points, to decks that attack everyone else, to super protected please-don't-anyone-mess-up-this-point-scoring-engine decks.

With so much in the box, it feels like a magnum opus of boardgames, and quite possibly Level 99's best game design yet.

Astounding design! A massive labor of love to abstract the entire CCG experience into one game (buying boosters, trading, playing tournaments, building broken combos...) Wow.

It mostly delivers. The gameplay works, and there are hundreds of cards (with references to everything geeky). The setup is a bit extreme (with its MASSIVE store deck), but it is a game unlike any other.

How to even begin with this game. At this point in time it is my #1 game. It takes me back to being a kid collecting cards to a ton of different CCGs. I love all the references, on all the cards (of which there are like 800). Throwing the stacks of cash around and buying "packs" and trying to make a combo of the cards you have, oh but James is looking for a card to make a sweet combo, well James you can have it for sweet friendship victory points, all while you're under a time limit! 
It's just... fun, it makes me feel like a kid again, back when I used to throw my fat stacks of allowance money at booster packs, and the hours and hours of joy I used to get out building decks and looking through my cards 10,000 times.

I've only played this game twice, only the 2-player variant.  So while I absolutely love the concept and was super-excited to play and enjoyed the game, I'm just going to lay out some things I didn't like:

A:  The rulebook is confusing.  I think that's probably inevitable with a game this complicated, but it was hard to know where to look for some rules questions.

B:  I've played Magic: The Gathering off and on as a total amateur for 20 years - Millennium Blades condenses the experience of having e.g. a Sealed Deck tournament into 25 minutes.  It's a lot of fun to have to read all the cards quickly and decide whether they're useful or not, but I'm afraid that the learning curve on this game is too steep.

C:  I think the game portion suffers somewhat with only two players - in Game 2, I made a deck that gets points for turning cards over, and my opponent made a deck that clashes.  So he was basically out of luck.

I'm hoping to introduce it to a larger group but I'm not sure they'll enjoy it.

Very cool concept. Brings back memories of deck-building in MTG and the stress of a tournament atmosphere. Has one of the best rules ive seen in any game (If you F*** up, too bad thats part of the game!), its actually pretty liberating. Unfortunately the actual "game" within the game is not great. Long play time and long set-up makes it difficult to hit the table, but its a cool experience none the less.

I love the idea of this game, although it simulates CCG players it is very euro in getting points. It can be a frantic mess, and that is fun

Excellent game that captures the essence of CCG's. Love the realtime hectic deckbuilding and booster pack buying. Only downside is the long cleanup time when you separate hundreds of cards back into their original decks.

1 play with 4 players so far, It simulates the CCG experience magically (both the highs and lows). I can't wait to explore the game more.

4 plays in an I'm still lovin' it. Solid 9. Let's see if the expansion, or even having veteran players to play against so I can use all the little modules, make it a 10.

I find the live rounds to be really frustrating--there isn't a lot of time to really read all the cards and think about things but that could get better with more plays when you know the cards a little more. First game was a little chaotic but kind of fun. Card comboing reminds me of Seasons.

I actually enjoyed it more then I thought I would. Normally I don't dig real time games but this was pretty good. I do like the theme and the art. There were some things I didn't enjoy. Like I ended up only playing 1 different card from my starting deck for the entire game and I still won. Very few cards comboed as well as my main deck so I just stuck with it and I still won. Also it is a bit fiddly at first. I would still play it again.

Millennium Blades is both a love letter and blistering critique of the Late 90's early 2000's collectible card game scene. Players will spend all of their money on blind purchases, throw half of them away and then spend a great deal of time trying to trade for or buy on the secondary market all of the pieces they are missing to make a deadly tournament deck.

Whether they are successful or not, by the time the next tournament rolls around, the meta has shifted and opponents have adjusted their decks to attack the leaders, making all the work you put into those first decks completely wasted. The only choice is to build a whole new deck,  dissembling the current one to pay for the next.

It is an absolutely perfect tribute and biting commentary on the trials and tribulations of collectible gaming. Players get an allowance, which they then spend on cards. There is a secondary market to sell duplicate or high demand cards through and open negotiations between players just to swap cards to the benefit of each. The crazy part, is that it all happens in real time. You have twenty minutes to organize your boosters, make your deals, plot a deck and find the missing parts to make it work. That sounds like a long time, but trust me, it's not. The game literally pulls your brain in four different directions and there is even a specific rule that prohibits back tracking. Make a bad decision and you have to live with it. It's an important rule, because it is what makes the real time element so impactful.

The card game tournaments themselves are almost laughably simple. There is barely a game there, yet it feels extremely satisfying to have the card combo you discovered go off for eighty points in a tournament. It's an abstraction of a tournament, but it provides enough interaction to make it feel like a cunning battle of deck designs.

Aesthetically, the cards look great. They are the usual anime style Level 99 is known for, but there are also a ton of hilarious nods and spoofs of pop culture icons. The money system is a real treat as well, with players tossing big banded stacks of money around when selling cards or making purchases. There is also a ridiculous amount of content in the box, again, as is usual with Level 99. Hundreds of cards, variant rules, expansion modules and loads of Promo cards.

If you have spent any time at all on the collectible gaming scene, you need this game in your collection.

This game perfectly captures everything about CCGs. The market phase is frantic and fast, and the tournament phase is extremely clever tableau building. The theme pulls you in and is definitely strong, but it's the mechanics that keep you interested for all three rounds. Love it.

I thoroughly enjoyed it.  But, it is a bit of organized chaos, and won't be for everyone.

I think the key is that you CAN'T expect to read all of the cards, understand them all, and work out the best combos in the time available.  Therefore, you have to prioritize your efforts and hope it all works out.

This will likely be a tough thing for most Eurogamers to do, particular ones that are steeped in the culture of finding the "optimal" move.

Level 99 knocked it out of the park with this one. As long time MtG player AND board gamer this captured everything I love about the struggle of cracking boosters, fighting the meta and working with limited resources in order to build the best possible deck you can before this weeks FNM. Would 100% recommend to any card player not just magic, as it has wonderfully cheeky references to all sorts of fandoms and the mechanics are solid anywhere from 2 to 5 players.

So far, I have enjoyed this game...but there is something here that just does not hit hard enough to 'ring the bell'. As a set collection game more than anything (to me), I felt like there were interesting choices to be made in attempting to synergize the cards collected during the Deckbuilding Phase, but in the end, it seemed like the group of cards mattered less for their abilities and more for their overall "Type" or "Element". Winning the 'Clashes' were not exciting...in fact he tournament  seemed rather tame, although to be fair, it is only one part of the whole game, so the 'tameness' did not detract from any enjoyment...it just did not add much to it either. Overall, it did succeed at simulating a condensed version of being involved in the 'CCG' world. It had delightful art that gave nods to a variety of video game personas, games, famous folk and other popular culture references which was enjoyable to discover. 
The game runs smoothly and the the timed aspect is much appreciated to help keep the game moving forward. I will need to play this more so my 'score' may or may not change. It is a very solid 7 here for me.

Whew did I ever make the mistake when all 4 of us playing were newbs to not hold a pre-tournament.  People could not digest quickly how to dev a strat.  It ended up kind of miserable but we all liked the game a lot.  Next time will definitely do that.

I've only actually played this game once, since receiving it last week. But I gave it a high rating because it delivered on giving me the ups and downs of the CCG/TCG world. We didn't play 100% true to the rulebook, as this was our first play through. There were three players. We played a pre-release and one complete round of deck-building + tournament. Ican hardly wait for the next play session, hopefully with more players.

I had a few enjoyable moments during this game playing with my friend and making some card combos, but I didn't enjoy the timed aspect at all and many of the cards where very technical/mathematical and I didn't really care for that either.

Was chaotic with five players, but three was very good. It succeeds in simulating the excitement of opening of boosters in ccg's, deckbuilding under time pressure and the cardgame itself is simple but enjoyable.

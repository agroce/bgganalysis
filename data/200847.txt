A bit chaotic, quite difficult to figure out what's going on as you get so little visibility and then it flips.  I think there are better games out there of a similar nature - but the pieces and art work are good.

Great theme, and there's a little more to do than just guessing your friends' identities.  It handled a larger group well, but I'd like to try it with six or so. I suspect it plays better in that range. When you get too big, it's just chaos.

RATING: 8
Need to play a few more times to see if the system holds up to repeated play, but initial impressions were very good. There isn't tension in all of the choices, as sometimes the roles just make completely obvious the choice for the receiver, but this looks to scale very well and play quick with some degree of chaos.

Enjoyed this enough to play it twice, it is not often a game with deduction in it gets the fine balance right on providing enough just knowledge to deduce some of what is going on without making it blatantly obvious very quickly. Cards could do with a better symbology (two games in and I was still looking at the play aid) but other than that a solid, clever, gamers filler.

I understand why most people keep tearing Secrets apart: it’s so chaotic and random that its outcome slips out of a player’s control quickly and most gamers get panicked as soon as they aren’t in control.

And yet when playing Secrets you’re to resign yourself to being like a boat in a storm: you have to endure it and hope you’ll end the game unharmed.
Sure, this means you might even lose a game or two without having any chance at winning but who cares? The point here isn’t winning as much as having fun by trying to get the other players in trouble and doing something just to «see what happens».

RATING: 5.8
This game is odd. It's actually pretty weak with a large number of players and I'd recommend you do not pull it out with larger player counts. In this format you lose control and have very little agency in the game.

At lower player counts it is solid as kind of a team evolution of Mascarade. I don't think it's as wild or interesting as its competition though.

Heard about this game from a podcast - not sure which one. Think it was SU&SD. Actualol also talked about it.

You give other players cards (Cockroach Poker style) and try to get them the cards they need (if they are on your team) or ones that will take away points (if they aren't on your team).

Looking forward to playing this.

Another in the series of the Social Deduction game, this time with some Prisoner's Dilemma mechanics Bruno Faiduti and Eric Lang have been playing around in the recent years. I had a chance of play testing this game with Eric Lang at Essen Spiel 2016. The components in the final version are outstanding, though. I couldn't stop playing with the heavy plastic discs. OK game, but nothing new.

I bought this game for my ESL students but it's totally possible to play this game without talking. I like it. You have to play with friends who are ready to focus and follow what's going on. Don't play it with friends who are smoking weed at a party.

RATING: 6
A bit of a mashup between Mascarade and Cockroach Poker with some extra intrigue due to the factions. 
Every turn a player draws two character cards, shows them to everyone and offers one of them to another. If the player accepts they flip it over and keep it but if they don't it comes back to the first one - then its ability activates. Two of the factions want to collect the most points and another wants as few as possible. 
The character abilities are interesting but they generate a lot of chaos. Your character token might get swapped with someone else and you might not even know who it was with. It's also very likely you won't get a chance to check which one it is now. 
The production is really nice, especially the big tokens.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Biggest problem with the game is the quality of the components. The cards are not bad, but they are rather flimsy, and while I was playing with my copy, I noticed people fidgeting and worrying with them and I nearly had a conniption. That and the hippy really has no shot when there is only one, not when players really prioritize team play. But the game is short and fun, and just thematic enough to fuel some comical interactions. It won't replace Secret Hitler or Werewolf, but if you like those kinds of games, you'll likely enjoy this as well. I prefer it to masquerade.

5-7 players? By Bruno Faidutti and Eric Lang. Card game with hidden roles, partnerships, deduction, and bluffing. Similar to Mascarade (by Faidutti) and Cockroach Poker. Components can be easily marked and aren't easily sleeved (/video/145965). Many reviewers say there is too much randomness. No gameplay videos as of 2017-11-06.

RATING: 5
Social deduction game.  I like that there's choice on whether to take the offered card or not, which gives that bluffing factor to it.

I do like the plastic coins, it adds to the value of the game.  But doesn't do much else other than that. 

Not a huge fan of social deduction games with this game, you don't always know which team you're playing for after a few swaps and it doesn't give you a clear strategy/goal to win with.

Figuring out who is what role and then what card to give someone is the fun part of the game.  Not knowing what role you have and playing blindly isn't particularly fun, but it can be humorous.

Game had a lot of chaos but I did enjoy the interaction between the players. You need to really know the cards as I had to keep referring back to the cheat sheet with each draw, and this took me out of the game a bit. I think with more plays my rating "might" go up. Maybe the iconography could have been improved just a tad.

Nice components (those discs!), but ultimately the game doesn't quite gel.  The gameplay isn't as intuitive as other hidden role games and the payoffs aren't satisfying,  in an eight-player game, things would get lopsided where a good number of players aren't getting in on the action as much as others.   Up for giving it another shot with a smaller group to see if it plays better, but overall, a disappointing purchase.

Despite attractive components (chunky ID chips) and a decent theme, this just hasn't clicked with my games group. Other hidden role/social deduction games continue to be popular but this seems to miss the mark, perhaps because our plays have proven either to be overly chaotic or have meant the game has been over before we'd gone completely round the table.  I have the (pointless) Bruno Faidutti promo card that was given out with Tabletop Gaming 01/18.

I am surprised by the low ratings. This is nothing like Werewolf, Resistance, etc. It's am entirely unique hidden teams game, and it works! Alliances shift, but not so frequently that you can't follow the action. The point/card powers are balanced and allow for plenty of opportunities for bluffing and tactical play. It's not going to blow you away, but Secrets stands on its own just fine. Totally underrated.

Doesn't quite click, though I didn't like Mascerade either - in the end winning can be largely determined by luck due to the sudden win conditions and the fact you could switch teams so easily. A game where the teams were fixed and perhaps allowing you to change "roles" instead would've been much better.

Pretty fun and quick hidden role game. The fun thing about this game is that you dont have to lie if you dont want to which makes it more accessible to people who dislike Avalon because it forces you to lie. You can play an honest game if you want or lie if you want to take advantage of the situation. The character cards are pretty interesting and mixes up the game play/teams, also the catch up mechanic (NATO) was well designed also.

RATING: 5
Secrets is a perfectly fine little ditty, especially for those who don't play all that many social deduction games. But there's a distinct lack of player agency here, which is compounded by a slight disconnect between the need to uncover who's who and the turn-by-turn process of revealing and offering cards. In practice, it tends to be slow and silent, not at all what I want from my social deduction.

An OK hidden roles game, but it just doesn't stretch to 8 players very well. Probably good with 6, but at the full player count it doesn't keep enough people involved in every turn to hold interest. By the time people were taking their second turn, phones were out, people were getting distracted and chatting among themselves, and we ended the game early by deliberately giving someone their 4th card. 
Oh, the hippie won? Whatever, moving on...........

What can i say ... very party game. We were 6 people. The boys liked it, the girls don't. We would play it again but now the question is with whom ?! :D ... So, the game is very addictive at the beginning and the conspirative thing is there. You start to follow hints whom is whom and you start to build nets of conspirativeness .... but at one point the game changes to chaos. And you don't know whom is whom and at last the game is decided by ... luck. It's very very difficult to build strategy. Maybe if everyone can have a sheet of paper and a pen to write and more easyly to remember what's happening ... In conclusion the game is nice, not exceptional and we'll try to play it again :)

For me it's the worst social deduction game. It is far less social and more Deduction about phisical position of gamingchips on the table. I realy like the deduction by guessing the behavior of my teammates - could be good for peopel who don't like to lie in a game ore get their information by social skills.
To be fair it's not that bad - but I feel like you have not that much impact on the outcome of the game quite often.
I simply would prefer Werwolf, Secret Hitler or  The Resistance: Avalon everytime over this one. If I didn't know them I would think that this game would be great.

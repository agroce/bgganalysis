I could tell from the moment I finished setting up that in execution this game absolutely failed to deliver on what should be a home run conceptually. The boards are so excruciatingly tiny that any depth or strategy in positioning is almost completely lost. There's so much unnecessary bookkeeping to be done that the game will get bogged down to a crawl during the boring parts making the one fun part seem to blaze past in comparison.
I feel like it was erroneously designed with the idea that it would be perfectly acceptable to require as much thought, set-up, and preparation as an actual pen&paper RPG.

We had a blast pitching the discs around, well, at least when we weren't cursing the miniscule board.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It really shouldn't work - it's such a silly idea. Yet, it somehow manages to be truly thematic. The game over-rides the alpha player problem of most co-ops, because in this game, one player can boss another around as much as he wants, his colleague still has to make the final flick. This balances the power-scales a lot. This game is better than Subutteo, better than Pitch-car. It is infinitely expandable, with scope for new dungeons, new characters, new abilities, new terrain. Excellent stuff.

Great dexterity based game. I'm the only one in my group who like it.

I was really excited when I picked this up. I ran through a campaign with my group...who were totaly ambivilant about it. I would have like to have gotten to play it myself once. :/

A good dexterity game due to being a dungeon crawler. Dungeon masters need to know the cards/spells to know what could come. Unfortunately I'm terrible at dexterity games and I'd rather just play a thinking game.

Quick and extremely fun game, it is dexterity and usually I miss by miles but then again this makes it more fun, tense and adrenaline pumping at times this one is a good family game. The artwork in rooms could look better and it is very bland but it does the job and room boards are not a big part of the game anyway.

RATING: 8.5
This game's creators have accomplished the impossible!  They took a dexterity game and morphed it into a dungeon crawler...rather successfully, I might add.  This game has a wonderful tactical quality you do not see in other dexterity games.  As the players move from room to room, they have to use their resources intelligently or the Overseer (assuming he/she is competent) will grind them down.  The different creatures/characters/items fit the theme of the dungeon crawl genre AND make for a fun dexterity game.  These qualities ensure that Catacombs will be hitting our gaming table for years to come!

A deserving nominee of the Diana Jones award for innovation.  You can get much more theme out of crokinoling a dungeon crawl than I had ever dreamed was possible.  The first edition has atmospheric 'hello Russ Nicholson' seventies Brit fantasy style art, which I love but accept might not appeal to those with different memories.  The new edition has perfectly good bright popping art which many might like more.

I sort of like Catacombs, it's amusing, etc.  The big problem for me is that it's rules make "did X hit Y" the key point, and indirect hits don't count.  Alas, this means you very often, for the most critical points, have to guess.

RATING: 8
Pure brilliance.  Crokinole meets a dungeon crawl, and the abilities of the heroes translate into different mechanics for how you flick their tokens at the monsters, that totally work and are well themed.

One of the most innovative games in a long time.  Combines great dungeon crawl theme with a dexterity game.

I'd much rather play straight Crokinole.  Cute idea.  Thought it would be totally devoid of decisions, which improved in later rounds with the healers and such.  I don't think the overlord has a chance against competent heroes.  Glad I checked the box, zero interest in replaying.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
A delightful game of drunk adventurers in a dungeon. Watch the team devise an intricate plan of attack, then groan as the barbarian immediately trips over his feet and faceplants.

After a play or two with the normal rules, you will find that it is more fun to play the labyrinth variant, which can be found online (here on bgg as well, I think), or to create your own layout. However, an important point here is that with the expansions, the game can become very difficult for the heroes if the overlord plays defensively, and that's not necessarily a good thing. Either make house rules to prevent the overlord from hiding his pieces, or (much better) just pick an overlord that is more interested in the entire experience being fun than in winning.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
As a dungeon crawl game, this isn't really going to grab your attention.  As an innovative or at least a creative mash-up of game concepts, it certainly will.  The flicking mechanism that dominates the game play is bound to get players hooting and hollering with each flick.  The scenarios are challenging and quite balanced all things considered.  The game's strength is also the biggest drawback in the game.  The flicking mechanic has quite lackluster handling of "out of bounds".  A strong flick will send your piece careening off the board bouncing around everything.  It's impossible to actually see the action in real time when the flicking is out of control and this leads to the inevitable 'well... I didn't really see it hit that piece before it bounced off the wall and around Johnie's head twice before it landed in your drink there'.  Some penalties or stronger effects of leaving the playing field would be a nice addition.  A frame with and wall around the boards might also be nice as a DIY enhancement.  So with a little house ruling and reasonable play, the game could be a fun alternative to the the drone of rolling dice in those other crawl games.  Definitely worth a try as an alternative play experience.

I have a soft spot for flicking games.  I have a soft spot for racing.  I like Carabande.

I do not care much for one-sitting RPGish stuff (non campaign big box RPGish games).

However, I love this game.  More than Carabande even.  Sure it is a little thin, but that comes with flicking game territory.  Catacombs turns the thinness of flicking into the chance part of monster combat in an elegant way.

Honestly, this is more like golf, pool, and hack&slash mixed together, all in a good way.

In a domain of just flicking games, this would be at least a 9, with maybe Crokinole sort of the '10' mark.  In a spectrum of all games, it gets up to maybe '7'.

This needs to be played with the right attitude - there's quite little strategic depth and a player's turn can last very little time indeed. Game effects like stunning are particularly harmful to enjoyment, so I need to try to figure out how to rework that. The one time I played this, I think I was the only player enjoying myself most of the time - and as the Overseer, I got a lot of interaction with the game, much more than the rest of the players.

On the positive side, very innovative, and physically well implemented.  However, this is more an "experience" game,  and it didn't grab me at all.  We adventurers won easily (good cards helped),  and there just wasn't any tension.  Save your money and get a decent Crokinole board.

Would need to play a few more times to make a final judgment, but seems like a fun light-hearted dexterity RPG.

What great fun!  Been looking forward to this one for a LONG time!  Simple, yet extremely clever mechanics make this seemingly odd combination of dexterity flicker (ala Carrom or Subbuteo) and dungeon crawl really work!  Quick to set up and play, adults played with young kids, all had a blast. Already one of my all-time favorite games!  Sheer genius.  Neat how you sometimes think, "Well, I know what this kind of creature SHOULD do ( I play DnD after all), wonder how they handle that with flicking disks."  Then you read the Special Power of the creature and think, "Hmm, that makes perfect sense. Cool."  (They did a terrific and clever job at translating fantasy elements into the flicking mechanics).

Brennan and I have a really fun time playing this and it definitely provides some "yay!" moments.  I like the fact that it is semi-cooperative just like D&D for more than 2 players.  But I also appreciate that it plays REALLY well as a 2-player game.  (In fact, I wouldn't recommend more than 3 players as I think each Hero player needs at least 2 characters to run to keep them engaged enough.)  I like the fact that each hero has _some_ special capability, but not so many that it makes it too complicated to run.  I like the fact that the game plays out over a number of smaller rooms, so that during lunch hours the game could be stopped after a room and picked up another lunch hour.  And of course I liked the fact that it is a dexterity game.

I can see someone going totally overboard with a system like this and trying to make it really complicated and elaborate.  I appreciate that the designers kept it down to a quick, fun game.

Initial rating - need to play more.

Pitch Car as a dungeon crawl, with different creatures, characters with different abilities.

Plays fast. I like it and I usually avoid dexterity games!

Some downsides:

Would be better with an 'edge'. Enthusiastic players will have the tokens going all over the place, and there's much more to keep track of than in pitch car.

Treasure value seems meaningless after the healing encounter (no opportunity to use it there after), but this can be fixed with alternate layouts or an expansion.

Overall surprising hit.

** Update - dexterity element just doesn't interest others as much as me :( seeing no playtime, now (reluctantly) traded.

One play.  Wacky in concept.  Might be a bit too drawn out, as the Overlord was having lots of trouble until the final level.  Still fun as it successfully combines tactics and dexterity, and the fantasy theme is fun even if it is a bit too Goth.

I loved the idea of mixing PitchCar with Descent. It makes a good entry-level for dungeon-crawls or a heavier partygame.

I like the cartoony artwork a lot. The component quality is superb...well, the cards could have been printed on thicker cardstock, but since you don't move/shuffle them a lot I think it is okay. You could still sleeve them though.

OK, well, I dunno. I do like Catacombs. It's a gimmick game in the line of Space Dealer, but it's a gimmick game that does really work.

But it may follow its 'bad D&D' theme a little too closely. I think there are too many encounters, too many of which are no legitimate threat to the good guys, and too much time is spent in an attritional wearing down of the heroes and consuming their resources rather than presenting real, interesting risks. Most of the level 1 rooms don't present any real threat to the heroes, it's just a question of disposing the bad guys efficiently. Which is OK but not great. I wish there was more of the combat was high-stakes, and that the narrative curve was better.

Also, it seems pretty clear the balance in the base game is off - the Overlord doesn't stand much of a chance. Upgrade the level 0 encounter to a level 1 and 1 level 1 to a level 2 at the very least. It's not confidence building to see problems like this.

Anyway, I don't want to over-ding it because Catacombs is fun. But it is still a gimmick game that does its gimmick well but I don't think it seriously deliver on its promise as a game. I imagine that I'll enjoy it for a while, but at the end of the day, I'll be going back to Carabande and Bisikle.
---
Important Note: The Barbarian's Rage track starts on 2, not 3!

Only played once, but got a real kick out of it. The tactics are interesting and the dexterity element clever. I dunno if it has replayability, but the design is inspired.

It seems on first impression to be rather hard on the Overlord player, but it also seems easy to tweak the difficult level. I may add another '2' level room at the end next time. Also I suggest bypassing the initial level 0 room and starting at level 1, even your first time out. The game is only fun when the Overlord has creatures that have a legitimate threat to do serious damage. So fewer, more dangerous encounters are always preferable.

Also, 3 players may be the sweet spot. More players can mean more discussion of tactical options, which means more time, which is something this game really doesn't need. It wants to play fast. Two players vs. one Overlord would keep the downtime under control and the game moving. But your mileage may well vary based on the gameplay style of your groups.

All of the variants/expanded rules on offer look pretty awful. I'll stick with the base game. If the game holds up, hopefully we'll get some more monsters, Overlords, and maps.

RATING: 7.5
So far, I like it, but I fear my groups may be less enthused. One of them has expressed a desire to play more. Most certainly a game that uses flicking/dexterity as a central element, so folks who aren't good at it will find it frustrating. I found it very creative.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
Very unique game which plays like a combination of Pitch Car and Descent.  It's one (overlord) vs. many (heroes), offers good variety, and plays quickly.

The different powers possessed by the different classes and monsters are all pretty clever and great implementations of theme.  There is a decent variety of rooms/terrain as well as enemies to slog through and items to acquire.  We really love the asymmetry of the heroes.

Overall a well-executed game from a small company that deserves support for its ingenuity.

RATING: 8
All the fun of a disc-flicking dexterity game combined with dungeon crawling, monster-bashing goodness!

This is really fun stuff for all the obvious reasons. There's a couple seemingly obvious flaws though:

-Early game is really just dull for both parties. I get that you don't want to overwhelm the heroes, but it's boring for them too when nothing provides a challenge. Difficulty curve needs a rework.

-Killing monsters is just too lucrative given how little opportunity you have to spend your gold. Heroes always have enough gold to do basically whatever they want... also why do you get money after you can no longer spend it? Feels like there should be some randomness to earning cash, too. Knowing exactly how much the party is getting when they enter a room is a little underwhelming.

-No rules for ricocheting opponents into other opponents both seems like a missed opportunity for some cool stuff AND sometimes makes it hard to see who's legally taken damage.

-No real penalty for leaving the board, despite how easy it is to leave the board, feels like a mistake.

Despite that, it's a lot of fun. It's just a little short of its potential.

A dungeon crawler that requires dexterity to move and attack. Fantastic and fun but the art is a tad amateurish. The reprint looks excellent though.

RATING: N/A
An inspired mix of PitchCar and D&D. The board artwork is holding me back from buying. Some of the boards are pretty hideous and simply don't look like the floors of dungeons to me. Kwanchai's redesign of the adventurers and monsters look great and if I got this game I'd use his artwork though really the rest of the art needs to be redone too.

Update. Amazing! A new edition with Kwanchai's art.

Really cool, and to me a totally new take on a carom game.  It does tend to come down to tight endings, but often they can feel a bit too tight.  The players can feel a bit screwed, especially with item draws.  Overall a cool game that I'm usually willing to play, although sometimes I feel a bit bored with the lack of flicking that players get to do.

I love that this is a dexterity game with the pucks and is not so random as some others.  Unfortunately I was the GM for the first game, and crushed my players, however they did get fairly far and I look forward to letting one of them be the GM next time.  Once we figured out the rules correctly the first time, it only took 2 sentences to get a late joiner going.

I enjoy dexterity games. I like theme-heavy games....and the dungeon-crawl theme is a great one for this format. 

I think this small/new company did a great job with this one. The rules are clearly represented. The game is well-supported online. My pieces did come with a bit of mold, but its really a non-issue and was easy to clean. Some folks like to complain about anything they can.

As for gameplay, I found that it was much faster than I had expected from comments here. If at least one player is well-versed in the rules (the overlord usually), they can keep the game flowing nicely. I'm looking forward to lots of play with this one.

Really fun gameplay. There's something great about combat being resolved based on skill rather than just the luck of a die roll. Awesome art. Wish there were a few more items in play in each game. Also, the characters seem pretty unbalanced... Some of them are kinda boring and could really use more powers. Meanwhile, some of the expansion characters are super powerful. Then there's the chicken... he's on a sword in the picture, but he can't equip weapons. No fun! That would be the best part! Wait, am I talking about Kickstarter exclusives? I don't even know!

As one of my friends said, "It's kind of like Descent, but in 1/4 (or less) of the time."

[b]Kickstarter - September 2015[/b] 
Fun dungeon crawl/dexterity game.  In actuality, I find the game is at heart a two player game: hero vs monsters.  The cooperative nature comes into play with each player taking on a different hero, but it is a common goal for all to win the game.  The gold accumulated may go to another player to buy a better upgrade towards the group than what would benefit that own player.  Hence, a two player game.

Una auténtica maravilla de juego! Es mi primer Dungeon Crawler, y no me ha decepcionado en absoluto. Es de esos juegos en los que te lo pasas muy bien jugando, tanto si ganas como si pierdes. Muy accesible a todo tipo de jugadores (aunque el tema sea algo friki), y realmente te sientes dentro del tema. Las habilidades y todo estan muy bien conseguidas, mención especial al mago del D&D 3.5. Por decir un fallo... el juego brilla a 5, si no, palidece algo... y a 4 es bastante horrible. Pero bueno, que si sois 5, es una completa maravilla. Recomendado el set gráfico de Tzalem (el 2º, que el primero tiene un par de fallos)

RATING: 9
Very fun dungeon crawling dexterity game. Requires both skill (flicking) and strategy (it's semi-coop: heroes vs. a 'catacombs lord'). Art and graphic design are only ok -- too amateurish and too dark for the fun this game provides.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Components: Simple wooden discs. Simple, retro artwork. The real problem with the production is realizing the central mechanism of flicking: how do we prevent the discs from flying off the board and disrupting other pieces; how do we know which exact discs were touched by a fast-moving disc?

Experience: In terms of a dungeon crawl, this is brilliant. It perfectly captures the tactical, positional, and real-time aspect of a dungeon fight lacking in other dungeon games I've played.

It's not very strategic. Just flick and hope for the best. And the flicking is so imprecise that it's difficult to play without error.

It's fun even as the overlord.

Honestly, I think this game is missing something incredibly important to a good dexterity game.  I can't quite put my finger on what that might be, but I can say that I dislike the limited playing space and also things that have multiple flicks in a row.  You can just flick very gently each time for consecutive hits.  Still worth playing because its fun.  (Flick em Up is better.)

After two plays as the overseer, I'm wondering about the possibilities that the game's balance is not what it should be. While I did not trounce the adventurers, it was not very close and this was even true with weaker monsters in the second game. I want to try it a couple of times as one of the adventurers before pronouncing a final judgment and rating

RATING: 7.5
This flicking dungeon crawler game is tons of fun and a great idea, the only thing that really lets it down is the artwork, which is kind of "old school", lots of black and white line drawings, and some of the dungeon boards are very uninspiring. 

If you can live with that (and really I can, even though I've become accustomed to lush art in other dungeon crawlers of late, the difficulty is convincing others that the game is worth playing and it's not someone's bedroom PnP effort) then there is a lot of fun to be had here, but I would love to see some kind of premium edition in the future with top notch, full colour art.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Probably the most interesting dexterity game. Props for the innovative use of flicking mechanic by tying it to a dungeon crawl theme. However, what should be a 30 minute game ends up taking at least an hour. Thirty minutes would be spot on for a game of this sort. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Pretty fun for a dexterity game despite the horrendous art. Having unique characters delving into a dungeon to fight monsters by flicking your disc and hitting other discs is made interesting by the theme here. Even so I can't imagine wanting to play this a lot.

It was brilliant to combine a dungeon crawl with a dexterity game. I wanted to like Descent but it took too long. This scratches that itch, and besides flicking discs at each other is way more fun than chucking handfuls of dice over and over.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
What a hoot! The only issue is that (in the standard setup, at least) the Heroes seem to blow through most of the dungeon without much trouble (in fact, hoping for tough monsters in order to get more gold) and then struggle in the level 2 and boss rooms at the end. But players may not notice due to the amount of fun they're having.

The boss that the rules recommend using in the first game has a random damage-avoidance system that can get annoying, but simply using one of the other three bosses avoids that problem.

I suspect that adding the expansions may help make the game less top-heavy. The fact that I doubt I'll ever have a hard time getting this to the table means that they'll be a good investment.

As an old RPG-er I like most cooperative games and love the fantasy theme. A fun, moderately fast, finger flicking game with fantasy elements, what more could you ask for? After one play it seemed hard for the evil player to win. I think you have to pull the old throw everything at one player trick to knock them out, but that could easily kill the game for some players (pun intended). 

Can be problematic to get on the table unfortunately. A cooperative dexterity game with a fantasy theme, come on, who in their right mind would play that? Several persons in my play group reacted that way. Too bad.

An 8 with the right players, a 6 otherwise. I'll go with the average here.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Players play either a band of adventurers trying to defeat a dungeon, or the dungeon lord defending their lair.  Flicking game where the characters and monsters are wooden disks, that are flicked across various "room" boards.  A direct flick is a melee attack, which causes a wound.  Missile attacks are made with smaller disks, and there is even a wizard with disks of his own for spells.  Sounds corny, but it actually works really, really well.  Plays quickly, and the heroes must interact and cooperate to get to the end.  Simple idea, great execution.  A lot of fun.

Stupendously fun dexterity concept. Bonus points if you're like me and could play dungeon crawls until the end of time.

The expansion adds some heroes, items, monsters, and minor gameplay tweaks.

A dungeon-crawling game in which all of the heroes and monsters are wooden discs.  You flick them into each other to do damage, and there are lots of special abilities like the ability to fire arrows (smaller wooden discs) and cast spells like Summon Skeleton (gives you a minion token that functions independently).

The concept of doing away with a lot of the movement and positional management of a dungeon crawl and replace it with dexterity flicking is inspiring. Where the game I think lost a bit is that it is very tough on the heroes, I wouldn't want to see it be a cake-walk, but I think it should be a game which is hard on the Overlord rather than the other way around because flicking makes the game accessible, the difficulty though means you need to be good at flicking so it loses that accessibility. I'm glad that they made an art direction change because now my original collection is complete, I won't get anything new and I have plenty of play still left with what I have. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I think this game combines some neat mechanisms and dexterity elements... I am a little disappointed in the boards and I plan on creating what I'll call 'pick and play' layouts for using everyday items as obstacles and setting up units on an entire table instead of using their 'small' boards.  I think the boards are small enough that the strategic play suffers and hope to try out my new method soon.  As is, it still is a fun game to play.

This is an all (4 heroes) vs one (catacomb lord) dexterity game with a dungeon crawling/D&D theme.  The game is played over a number of rounds where you will be 'exploring a dungeon.'  Basically you'll set up a room scenario with bad guys and you'll have to flick your characters/weapons/spells (represented by various sized disks) at the enemy discs.  Both, players and monster have unique characteristics.  Between some of these scenarios you'll have a chance to buy items giving you more special abilities as well as heal/resurrect your party of adventurers.  When you reach the final scenario you have to fight a big boss.  It's a fun game for sure and there's nothing else is like it.  Things can get tense when important shots need to be made.  I think there are few issues with the game:

-Discs flying off of the board with relative ease and having to find them can sometimes be problematic.
-Trying to agree where discs have left the board and putting them back in the proper spot.
-Not having a slow motion to see if multiple enemy discs were hit by the heroes or if they have been jostled by other nearby enemies that have been hit.
-Since the heroes are collectively discuss the various ways to go about things, it sometimes feels like the game can drag when playing as the big baddie.

It should be noted that these are minor issues and if they cause major problems with your game group, then I think this is more of a group issue than a game issue.

Catacombs is a part dexterity, part dungeon crawler. It meets up pretty well between theme, accessibility, and the dexterity required to play. There's a lot I do like about this game: the mixture of fairly dry concepts, the boards, the modular, but easily set up dungeons, overmind player and light cooperative aspect. I'm really interested to see where the development of this concept goes.

(As of [b]5[/b] plays) A dexterity game crossed with a dungeon crawler. There are some RPG elements and tactical decision to be considered, but mainly it's about flicking things at other things in order to kill them, which is simply grand. Unfortunately, plays of this, at least with my group, tend to last about an hour longer than my interest in it.

This isn't typically the kind of game I envision myself becoming enamored with, but it has so many amazing, emergent qualities that I love.

To start, the artwork is outstanding, and invites players into it's theme better than any other game I've seen out there. Secondly, I think this game has better "table atmosphere" than any game I've played. Players all easily rile together against the overlord player, cheering and jeering by the affect of their tactics in action.

I haven't gotten to this yet, but this game is, put simply, a one versus all dungeon-crawler, flicking fighter-game. One player controls swathes of minions as players combat through a series of rooms. Once the players have succeeded through this gauntlet, they must defeat the Catacomb Lord (think video game final boss) or meet their demise!

All the many heroes and adversarial catacombs lords have their own unique, fun special powers, which allow for players to better situate themselves into combat roles, gauging where they are best suited in tactical combat. Though I don't typically like variable player powers, this is a game that wouldn't be good without them; how else could combat play out with an emphasis on positioning, timing and tactics?

The execution of theme through mechanics fits wonderfully down to the very last detail in game, and that is really something for a dexterity game. More than that, what so simply looks like a shallow flicker turns into something quite tactically meaty for the more hardcore at your table, as they try to properly arrange and maneuver their discs among the many minions without blocking line-of-sight of a later-to-move player.

I could go on and on, but really, if this has at all grabbed your interest, or if you've ever enjoyed a grid-based tactics combat game, seek this game out! At least watch a video review, as you've got to see the action of this game in motion to begin to appreciate just how [b]fun[/b] of a design this truly is!

A disc-flicking dungeon crawler? Sure! Why not??!

The heroes and monsters were surprisingly distictive throughout the game which led to some good discussions about how to attack each scenario.

As a dexterity game, this requires very little thought and almost becomes a drinking game, which is much more of a compliment than an insult.  I've had a lot of fun playing this game and, when combined with beer, this game can generate a lot of great memories.

The Cavern of Soloth expansion adds a lot of variety.

RATING: 5
The premise of Catacombs is pretty awesome, turning a dungeon crawler into a dungeon flicker that rewards both dexterity and tactical maneuvering. There are two implementation details that keep the design from being great: The first is a fairly small play area that feel very similar even with a number of different boards and that makes it too easy to leave the play area and (consequently) doesn't punish bad shooting enough. The second is that the sequence of different rooms to explore can become a little repetitive and thus make the game overstay its welcome. Catacombs is a fairly light-hearted flicking game and should therefore last no longer than maybe 45 minutes tops but it can easily go beyond that in practice. Considering that, having player elimination is a little unfortunate. That the rules resemble a mountain with dungeons running through every which way might be regarded as thematically appropriate but is yet another detail that the game doesn't get quite right.

Manages to scratch a few different itches simultaneously.  Has the physical enjoyment you get from a dexterity game, with a nice amount of strategy thrown in, too.  As with any dexterity game, people who don't have the flicking skills can find it frustrating.

RATING: 6
Really it's more fun than my 6 would indicate. Love to show it to new players. However, unless everyone is pretty good I've noticed a necessity for the player acting as Catacomb Lord to 'throw' the game a bit, or at least play in a way that can often be sub-optimal to ensure everyone at the table continues having fun.

RATING: 9
first edition: My one play rating is a 9 because it's exactly what I expected/wanted it to be. The art could be better and it would have been nice if the discs hadn't come with mold on them (the manufacturer is replacing them for me), but the game mechanics themselves work beautifully and intuitively. There is no complicated mess of rules to make the game work as a dungeon crawl. It just makes sense with a handful of rules. This game is simple fun. If it has any failing, it is that it can't be used for a truly competitive game as there are too many situations where you have to try and figure out what happened from aggressive flicking. If someone is too invested in winning, trying to figure out what flicked what could take away from the fun.

2nd Edition: this game has been improved in every way. The rules have been cleaned up, but more importantly the art and the play space have been significantly improved. there is no longer a disconnect from the theme because the art style is so strong consistent. I wish the expansion material was somehow denoted so that that game could be easier separated when combined. That is about all I can think to complain about the new edition. It's so much fun. That gelatenous cube is genius.

Fun dungeon crawl that doesn't take eons to play.
Basic rules are simple enough though rulebook wasn't exactly well written and clear enough for my tastes. A little fiddly in some areas but that's to be expected from an RPGish game like this. The expansions add some additional complexity and flavor.

Actually worked out better than I expected. This is exactly what I was looking for - Crokinole-like flicking game with dungeoneering role play. Everything worked well for the most part. It was great to see the co-operative play that was part of the Heroes gameplay. I felt a little lonely as the big bad Overseer waiting to slaughter everyone! Loved my little special powers here and there. Thought the merchant and healer rooms made sense and worked well. Ran a little longer than I was hoping for, bit I'm sure it'd speed up with a second game. Fun fun fun!

Maybe the disappointment of 2011. 
Hints of a really good game in there, but is lacking.
Rules are vague in areas, The boards really are too small. 
All the battle leading up the boss battle feel like filler.
Slow with more than 3 people. RPG elements maybe too underplayed. I look forward to seeing more games like this though.
*Update 11/2012*
Scored bumped up. Still enjoyable. The boards do feel to small and the boards are dying for side barriers.

Does a great job of combining the dungeon crawling theme with a dexterity game.

Longevity killers for me are the limited number of bosses, the limited character options (with a huge swiss army knife advantage for the wizard), the small loot inventory, and the undersized boards -- if I have to pick up a disc from the floor one more time, I swear to God...

The upcoming expansion sounds like it will inject new life into Catacombs for me next year.

I keep saying this in a variety of forums, but it's worth saying again: take the dungeon crawl/combat experience of Descent: Journeys in the Dark, subtract 3 hours & add the flicking element from Carabande... and now you have Catacombs.

The reason I have not rated this higher is mostly due to the length of gameplay. In my opinion the game runs a little long for what it is. I also feel that the Hero's are underpowered in relation to the Overlord and this makes the game a little too challenging for the hero's. There needs to be a better system for randomizing the rooms so that they ramp up in a more linear fashion along with allowing hero's to heal and improve beyond the one "equipment" room.

This is a fun, great idea. Even with the terrific redesign, however, there has  always been something a little off about the experience. It doesn't help matters when the Overlord is a better flicker than the people to whom he's teaching the game (but that's the problem with many all-vs-many games). 

I can't summarize it better than to say that many design choices were made to accomodate the fun, great idea at the core, which are not themselves fun or great. The rules for stun, for instance, simply state that the stunned player may not play the game for a turn. And you can stun someone over and over. Stuff like that.

A pretty cute/neat/fun little game, but not as good as I was expecting.  It is exactly what you think, a dungeon crawler where flicking controls movement and combat.  It does that pretty well.

I like both flicking and dungeon crawling, so I expected this to really turn me on.  In the end, it had some little issues which prevented me from loving it, but I'm not sure they can be fixed, they are just features of the combination of these two genres.  First, because of the damage system, much of the effectiveness of a character (aside from your flicking dexterity) is based on setting up and hitting shots where you strike multiple opponents.  The second really effective strategy is setting up behind cover and shooting ranged attacks through the cover.  The overlord can take advantage of that far more than the players.  So, despite there being different scenarios in every room with different monsters, nearly every room came down to one of those two strategies being employed.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it does make what would otherwise be a highly variable and replayable game seem more repetitive than it should be.  

Overall though, I like the game.  If someone else in my group didn't own it I would probably buy it.  In my opinion it is not so good that we need multiple copies in the group though.

This game has delivered exactly what I expected. It's a nice quick Dungeon Crawl using flicking to resolve combat. The monsters and heroes are well designed. It is fun to play any of them and they all require a little different approach. I do think it could have used a few more variants in the rules instead of on the website, and the item deck is a bit sparse, but I suppose the expansion fixes both of those things.

Well, it can take awhile with a different person controlling each hero.  But even at "awhile" it's still only a 2-hour dungeon crawl.

It's interesting that the whole goal of the dungeon keeper is to try and keep the game close.  I played my first full game and failed in that respect.  I went easy on them at first, then thought I needed to deal some damage to make up for that and keep it close going into the final room.

Anyway, it's just very different.  It plays fairly smoothly, and I think I'll keep it around for now.

I have had this game a while, and is just OK. I could take it or leave it, and if I could go back in time I would of passed on buying this game. What is good about it is that it does not feel like the other dungeon crawlers in my collection, or any other game I have in my collection. So I appreciate the variety and unique it brings to my collection, but the game can feel unbalanced (in favor of the overlord) and the rules should be much more stream lined. A small complaint is the art work, which I can not stand. I will play this with my kids because they like to play it, but I prefer not to play this one. I am waiting for a reprint/ better edition of it.

My first thought upon hearing "Crokinole + dungeon crawl" was "Sign me up!" I was enthusiastic but still expecting something light and silly, and then the game really exceeded my expectations. It's both surprising and impressive how much this game offers in the way of strategy and tactics. 

Crokinole is one of my favorite games, but I always wonder whether it should really be considered a board game, since it seems more akin to darts or barroom shuffleboard. Catacombs has much of the skill and tactics of Crokinole but also feels like a board game, with a theme I really enjoy.

This game is a mad amount of fun! Unfortunately, it's not for everyone, and I have a tough time getting this game to the table on regular basis. It's rare to find a person likes both dexterity and fantasy dungeon crawls, but if you do- this game is awesome. It's your basic dungeon, RPG-type game, but instead of having dice decide your fate you get to flick your characters and/or their weapons and/or powers to determine the victor. There isn't a ton of exploration or story embedded within the dungeon crawl- so it can feel a bit samey after 10+ plays, but there are expansions that do help this out a little bit. The components are average and not great. The art on the stickers you get to put on the pieces looks okay, but my wooden pieces were a bit crooked. Also, the dungeons looked a bit clip-artish. That doesn't stop the fun, but it is a flaw.

RATING: 9
Excellent very strong themed game, very well done overall too. Lots of room for variants and expansions which I already have many ideas for. The DM needs more interesting play like cards that allow him to play traps, regenerate or armor, remove an obstacle to make a trap, etc.  GREAT snicking game, note I am a sucker for the D&D theme though so take that into consideration with my rating but even some other theme that works as good as this one does (ie like a space theme) would have got the same rating from me. 

Hopefully the expansion really adds to the already great ideas in this game. 

Update: 8.25 => 9   Played some more and this is pretty much the perfect marriage for me, dungeon theme and dexterity game. The game is great and included lots of cool ideas, expansion should have a bunch more. My only gripe is the balance (to me) seems off so far with the Heros more powerful and there should be more interesting things to do as the Monster player ie. have some cards like the good guys. 

For now I'll tweak my game slightly (give some monsters 3 health in later rooms to counter the very powerful invisible thief with a knife attack etc) to even it up and add a few things and enjoy playing it. Prefer 2 players for this kind of game, size of boards lends itself better to 2 as well (a bit bigger probably would have been nice) but I could see playing with 3 too. Much more interesting than Crokinole, on par with Carrom BUT the theme really stands out in the game to me.

Other than the fold in the middle of the boards sending my pieces flying, this game is awesome. I've even played a few times with my boys, ages 6 and 4, and they love it.

I love the idea of this game. A flicking dungeon crawler; it's a great idea. The game falls very flat though. It's boring and with very little in the way of tactics. In part the small board really limits your options.

Low quality* flicking games have no merit in my book. Save your cash, literally, and save it again the next time you're tempted to buy something from this genre... and before long you'll be able to afford a worthwhile game like Carrom or Crokinole.

*Which is to say, cardboard is not a suitable surface to flick wooden discs on.

Clever, clever game and a lot of fun to play.  There's more depth and "fantasy spirit" to the mechanics than one might think at first glance.  Plus, it's easy to teach - we actually got some non-gamers to give it a shot.

We did find the game made things a bit too easy for the heroes - switching the final level 1 room for another level 2 seemed to tighten things up.  I don't think this is necessary if you're using the expansion.

Unique. So VERY UNIQUE. I don't know if we will ever see another board game that plays like Catacombs. I see it as a dungeon crawler + carroms. The fact that it uses small wooden pieces for all of the combat is very innovative and personally my favorite part of the game!

If you have any interest in dexterity games (specifically carroms-like dexterity games) or dungeon crawlers, you need to check this game out!

My only problem with Catacombs is how incredibly long the play-times can be. And on top of this, while you can create shorter campaigns, it does take away from some of the charm of the dungeon crawl. ON THAT NOTE, however, is that, in my opinion, house rules are encouraged! Deciding what all of the players want to do with the time you have makes for a great time with this game.

Lots to talk about here...

Taktika meets Descent meets Crokinole meets Dungeon Twister (in a way)  :)

VERY FUN!  And that's the important thing.
It mixes my favorite genre with an excellent mechanic really well. I love the old "AD&D" artwork. Very varied in its offering, from game to game.  The map choices, monster differences and item cards that show help make for a very replayable game.  And with the promise of expansions looming in the future, it's going to grow into an all-timer, for me.

Of all the goodness, I only wish it had slightly larger boards.  Even an extra 2'x2' would have been sweet.
I also wouldn't have minded an extra Hero choice or two...but we can hope for expansions, at least!  :)

Worth every penny and I see this one lasting a long time with me.

Very fun "flicking game" that can be really enjoyable in the right crowd.  It plays in a little bit under 60 minutes which is about right for a game like this and I've enjoyed the several plays I've had with it.

The things that are drawbacks for me is that it is rather chaotic (pieces flying off the table all the time), the very limited number of items, and the fact that it does start to feel a bit repetitive after awhile.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I liked the concept and some abilities ideas are very creative. However, flicking games where you need to track multiple hits is very problematic. Also, the board is too small for the number of discs on it. The game benefits turtling which makes the game boring if you play to win.

Catacombs is easy to like--dungeons, monsters, magic, heroes, animal familiars...and flicking!

It doesn't hurt that I'm a real cocky bastard when it comes to trumpeting my flickin skills...which are extraordinary.

This one could definitely go up with more play--I can't see turning down a game and I might even consider trying to get a copy for my collection.

The basic rules were pretty simple, but the individual characters had lots of specific rules and abilities to remember. I thought it was a bit complex, but with someone who thoroughly knows the characters, it was easy to figure out.

Some strategy involved, which was nice, and flicking of things across the board added a bit of *please don't screw up our well planned strategy with your shitty flicking!!!*

All in all I liked it, but I would definitely need to play several more times before even considering buying this treasure.

This was an entertaining flicking/dexterity game.  As one could imagine certain aspects of the game could be subject to interpretation such as the one-inch rule and agreeing on exactly which disk hit which other disk.  But it's a fun game; perhaps a big longish.  I wouldn't mind playing it again but I think if I were to buy a flicking game I'd opt for something else (although I'm not sure what that would be).  I waivered betweeen rating it a six or a seven.

Dexterity/flicking combined with a dungeon crawl seems, at first, to be a total train wreck.  But in reality, it's more of a "you got your chocolate in my peanut butter" thing.  I love how your skill with flicking the discs actually reflects the skill of your character/monster  And in how the discs push each other around, there's still a crap-ton of real tactics involved in positioning yourself, your allies, and yuour opponents around the board.  It's already one of my favorite dexterity games, and I can't wait for expansions!

A really fun dungeon explorer game... the flicking brings lightness to it, but to play it well it is not just flicking skills, you have to discuss with your friends and try to be a bit cautious and tactic... a lot of fun, especially after a couple of plays when you start to know the different shots etc...

Well, I'm calling this an 8 for now, but I may drop that a bit later, as even within the same game it's possible to feel a little "oh, this again."  It's a huge hit with kids, though, and there are a lot of clever little bits to like about it.  After playing Kevin's copy, I bought a copy for us, and then another to give to the Scotts.  Curious to see what they'll do with expansions, which I will probably buy.

UPDATE: Dropping this to a 6; [i]it is a good & clever game,[/i] but I never really want to play it, because of the "oh, this again" feeling mentioned above.  Long on novelty & cleverness, short on replayability.

First, I want to say that by playing this game, I have learned that I suck at flicking stuff. When flicking from the top, I hit the board and hurt my finger, when I flick from the side, I shoot in diagonal. So I can only hit stuff at point blank.

One things I liked about tumbling dice is that there is a luck element involved in the game, so even if you are not very skilled, you can end up being lucky (or skilled player can be unlucky. Here there is no such feature.

The idea is interesting, but it feels repetitive. The fact that there is no boarder around the board is annoying because pieces always get pushed outside.

Still, I consider this game to be somewhat broken. For example, some monsters/character has the ability to melee and shoot. This is extremely abusive because, when you hit your opponent in melee, he is going to be at point blank making you missile hit for sure. They should have inverted the actions.

The monsters looks pretty cool and have interesting abilities, the heroes sucks badly. I think the thief is literally useless and I think players should be able to start with a set of power up items else it makes some class very weak. There should also be a bigger selection of stuff.

The skeleton spell is also useless, what are the odds that my skeleton survive 1 round so that I get a chance to use it on next turn ... 0%.

Third, the healing and revival of characters is completely ridiculous. 1000 gold to revive a character could be acceptable, 300 to heal 1 HP is plain ridiculous. I means with an item worth 400-600, I could probably be more efficient than simply getting 2 HP.

I normally don't make comments about art since you should not judge a game by it's look. But the board and many card consist in a plain texture, with text over it, that could probably be generated by photoshop or other software. I don't have artistic skills, and I could probably do better.

This is why this game does not impress me at all. It's hard to make a good dexterity game and this one failed miserably to do so.

This game is an interesting combination of flicking and dungeon crawl and feels a bit innovative.  Still, it also started feeling a bit repetitive very quickly as the flicking space is fairly small - I wonder if the space was larger whether it would be more or less interesting.  This game is just calling for more expansions.  If both players hold back, the game could get dull and boring in a hurry...so be aggressive and the game is more enjoyable.

In a recent interview the writer M John Harrison said, "A good ground rule for writing in any genre is: start with a form, then undermine its confidence in itself . . . Ask what it's afraid of . . . then write that."  Ryan Amos, Marc Kelsey and Aron West appear to of followed this maxim clashing the simplicity of the 'flicking' dexterity games with the intricacy of dungeon crawls together.  Each sits at opposing ends of the gaming spectrum and we always thought should never meet.  But the designers have put them in the same room and locked the door.  Only opening it when they both got on.

Catacombs because of an open-minded approach is refreshing and a real surprise.  Innovative twists and combination of genres.  The designers have included established ingredients but brought something fresh to the table.  Superb.

Decent dexterity game. Each round you play on a board with different obstacles which was enjoyable. The characters aren't really balanced well against each other (the thief for example seems worse than the rest). The art on the discs is also sub par.

A nice twist on Dexterity game. Art and layout are a little low, but the gameplay works out decently. Its pretty basic skirmish rules that can be broken. I'd recommend expanding the dungeon to have extra rooms. Its a fairly easy game for the fighters to win.

Catacombs is a blast. It combines the best parts of PitchCar, which I love, with the best parts of a lighthearted dungeon crawl -- which I also love. It's an excellent one-against-many, which I don't have many of, and like PitchCar it unlocks fun reserves in people -- it's hard to not like it.

The characters are all interesting in their own ways, and I like that they're broken down by difficulty. The best moments are the wildly successful flicks and the horrible misses -- especially when the enemy really blows a shot.

I can easily see my rating going up; it's just such a fun game.

Not sure I like the flicking dexterity mechanic.  Will see if it grows on me. 

Didn't mind the tactical aspect though, and though that the opportunity to by extra gear was nice for the heroes (keen to try different game modes).  One of the issues with this game is that the pieces are liable to fly and it is possible to spend as much time trying to find them as it is playing the game.  A drop sheet or some sort of bumper would help considerably.

It can also be hard to see the exact order of impacts as the ricochets can happen at incredible speed.

I don't play many dungeon crawlers. This one is much more enjoyable to me because it replaces dice with dexterity. My one friend likes flicking very hard and it makes it hard to keep track of everything that is hit in the chaos that follows. (He can flick at only 1 speed. )

Whilst I had some fun with the central flicking mechanism (and who doesn't like flicking?); and whilst this is okay as a light dungeon crawl, it's far too long for what it is. Pitch Car is over in half an hour, so, whilst there is more to think about, the extensible length of this dexterity fantasy quest is, to my mind, a little questionable.

Not bad, but not that good, either.

This game is unique in my collection.  I love that the flicking is at the heart of everything you do.  I've only been the overlord so far, and I get into narrating what's happening and making a story out of the action.  I think the teamwork on the human side is interesting too.  

The downside is the long set-up and play time.  It's not as bad as some games, but it definitely has kept me from playing it at times.

I was very skeptical of this game when I got it based on the strange (oddly European) art and the fact that it is a dexterity game.  We finally set it up and had a blast with it. What is great about it is that it all hinges on your strategy PLUS your skill, rather than relying on one or the other.  I recommend. I would like to see a redone version with the character art.

I would rate this a 9 when playing as the adventurers and a 7 playing as the keeper, so I'll settle on an 8 overall. 

I like flicking games and this one is light enough to be fun even if your dexterity isn't great. As the keeper however it's hard to feel any sense of accomplishment as you rarely get to make great plays, you just hope to plink the heroes enough over time to stop them at or near the end. 

As the heroes it's much more fun as you get to mow down the enemies pretty quick. There are some seriously overpowered item combinations however that make the heroes next to unstoppable (thief's cloak of invisibility and the dagger in particular).

Now that I have had a chance to play this a couple more times, I'm having fun with it. It's even a little addictive. I have some niggling issues (for example, I wish the board were a little bigger), and I don't know how much staying power it's going to have.

I might like it better if I can continue to improve at it, and boy did I suck the first game or two. I found that rather shocking, because I've always had excellent hand-eye coordination and played Crokinole really well the one time I tried. Something is amiss in the universe, and I blame Eurogames. Why Eurogames? Why not? Do you expect me to blame myself? That's crazy talk. Still, I am improving, so maybe someday soon I can go back to my usual reasons for disliking Eurogames.

It's more tactical than you might think. It's not just flicking. The monsters have unique (or at least reasonably unique) abilities and appropriate tactics to match. And the heroes make a pretty balanced team that needs to work together.

It's a pretty innovative system that meshes well and is well balanced--surprisingly so for a game I was afraid would combine the worst elements of flicking and dungeon crawling.

One thing I really like about this game is how unique it is. Yes, there are flicky games and dexterity games and whatnot, but a flicky dungeon crawl? Nice! I'd love to see superheroes (Spider-Man shoots webs that incapacitate, Flash gets multiple moves, Thing does two hits in melee, etc.)

Ingenious combination of dungeon crawler meets flicking dexterity game.  The rules aren't terrible once you get them down -- some dungeon crawlers get too bogged down with rules and fiddly status adjustments.  The playing time is much more than 30 minutes as advertised.  Expect 1-2 hours depending on experience.  I'd probably like it better if it played faster.

The cloak of invisibility + poisoned dagger combination may be too powerful a combination for any overlord to defeat.

Fun game! It adds a dexterity element to an old-school dungeon crawl. One player vs the party, characters with different skills, monsters with different skills, equipment to buy...all revolving around flicking wooden discs at each other on varying boards with set obstacles. Flicking skill is important, but communication (for the heroes) and strategy is crucial as well. The game isn't without its blemishes (it's not always clear whether a piece was struck, it's not always clear where a piece left the board if something flies off) but it's fun enough to get past those little nitpicks. Catacombs is a winner.

RATING: 9
Love it, loads of fun! Ingenious application of disk flicking to a series of dungeon crawl scenarios. Requires both tactical and strategic thinking, rewards finesse over brute strength (I can see were wild players might ruin the game). Works well with two, even one. Have actually resisted playing it more to avoid wearing it out. [14 plays]

RATING: 7
I love the highly tactical nature of this. It requires some careful planning and a splash of luck, but still comes down to one's flicking skill.

Here's what I didn't like: the art. Seriously. The images of the heroes look like pencil drawings in an eighth-grader's notebook. The graphic art is also too dark, too clunky or crowded, and the color selection is garish. I realize this is an indie game without a big game company backing it up, but still, there is no excuse for fantasy art this ugly.

RATING: 4
I had one good experience with this game, and that was it. The idea is clever, and, despite being somewhat bored as the Catacomb Lord, I enjoyed watching the players coordinate moves and talk over tactics. They said they liked it, and my overly active imagination started cooking up how I could convert Keep on the Borderlands to Catacombs.

Unfortunately, this hasn't hit the table since. Although I personally prefer a quick flickfest to the bookkeeping and dice chucking of a typical RPG, that probably says more about boredom with traditional dungeon crawls than anything else. From a player's perspective, I can kind of see why this has only limited appeal. You work together through it once,  experience the clever fusion of theme and mechanics, but then aren't left with a whole lot there to draw you back for more. It's not like your character "levels up" or gains any new abilities the next time around. There's really not much to look forward to other than flicking some discs around again.

Thus, the theme falls away pretty quickly, making this nothing more than a flicking game. As such, it's okay, but not something I personally want to play a whole lot.

RATING: 7.5
Catacombs is essentially a dexterity game dressed in a fantasy theme.

An Overseer player takes on 1 or more hero players (4 heroes are always used) and the heroes need to battle their way through a series of rooms to face the Lord of the Dungeon and defeat him to win.

A variety of boards are provided and a good number of Dungeon Room cards are included, with only a small number used in any one game. This allows the game to offer up new experiences every time which is neat.

Each board includes large holes and obstacle discs sit in these holes, allowing both sides to take up strategic positions. Things like ranged combat are handled by allowing an arrow disc to be placed within 1 inch of the character firing and flicking the disc. Therefore a hero could be sitting behind cover and still get off a shot.

Melee attacks are simply handled by flicking the hero/monster and hitting the enemy in order to deal damage.

Each hero has specific powers to help the group and these need to be managed really well to allow each hero to compliment one other.

The Overseers various monsters then also have their own health point levels and powers and both sides need to weigh these up carefully to gain any advantages.

On top of all that is the basic skill of flicking discs. This can be quite challenging, especially with the smaller discs.

Overall I really liked this game. There is plenty of re-playability given the different Lord types and all the rooms that can mix and match to form unique dungeons. This is certainly one I'd like to play again and will likely buy at some point.

It is probably infinitely expandable too.

Embrace the randomness and its a ton of fun. Anything can and will happen since you are flicking tokens. While it is DM vs. group, both sides are fun since the DM gets to 'play' more. However, since there is less control, the DM can accidentally kill players and can't really fudge as there is no screen.

An interesting 1 vs. many dexterity game that simulates a dungeon battle via flicking disks - for a melee attack, you flick your hero into a monster in order to hit it (which then leaves you vulnerable since you're now close to it), whereas for a ranged attack you flick a small arrow disk from your hero to the monster. We've only managed to get this out once and didn't finish the game - it takes awhile to set up (and needs the right kind of table), and it can take a little while to get the coordination of flicking. Will have to see if we can get it back to the table.

Ignore the haters.  New art is great and much more in line with the tone of the game.  

Ordered the 'Chicks in a Catacomb' add-on as my primary gaming partners are my two girls...who frequently bemoan the fact that women characters are generally so under-represented (Dungeon! and Legends of Andor are nice exceptions).  Six female and 2 male heroes in this game?!  What's going on?!  I like.  Eldest has already called the Huntress and She-Wolf.  Youngest likes the Thief. Me?  I'm the Ice Mage. :)

This cooperative vs. one game is pretty fantastic in how much tactical planning the team must achieve in order to have a fighting chance against a competent Overlord.  The final room against the Boss becomes a five-minute discussion about the best strategies available, given our health and the layout of the room, etc., etc.  That's surprisingly deep for a mechanic that is essentially "it counts as a hit if you hit the guy".

It's only gotten better as the inevitable armada of expansions rolled out.

The one downside is the art.*  To paraphrase Holmes!, this stuff looks like the product of that kid in high school who drew Eddie from Iron Maiden over and over and over again.  It's not even that iconic yet awful style of Erol Otus' old-school D&D fame, it's just...  I understand -- you're a new company and this is your only game, you're funding it out of your own pockets, and you can't afford Phil Foglio.  Get some kids at your local community college and pay them a small chunka as an opportunity for them to build their portfolio.

Luckily, the gameplay is good enough to overlook this travesty -- just another sign of how good artwork enhances an already great experience.

* Version 3.0 now has wonderful, whimsical art from Kwanchai.  You now have no excuses.  Go.  Buy.  Now.  (And strangely, the art from v2.0 has grown on me over the years.)

I'd always have a difficult job to say no to this one, to be honest. Hero Quest with flicking, enormous fun with the right crowd, and not without a little strategy. My biggest whinge is that the boards should be at least 50% bigger and the discs weighted more subtly to provide different reactions. The art isn't exactly easy to deal with, either. But there's a lot of replayability in the flexible set-up, and an excellent range of mechanics, particularly in the promising-looking expansion.

This was an OK game. I Thought the innovative Idea would be better received by my group, but I don't think folks enjoyed it as much as they could have. I also was too lenient as a DM, I didn't want to crush them I wanted them to enjoy it. The flicking got very crazy at times, with discs flying far and away off the board.

We have disks starting at each end of a board, representing heros at one end, monsters at the other. You take turns flicking your disks around the board. If you hit an opponent's disk, you inflict a hit. Heroes have lots of hit points, monsters typically just 1 or 2. Do multiple rooms and then fight the big boss with lots of hit points. It's a game I should like as I love Crokinole, but it can be turned into a tactical coldwar drawn-out borefest - I'll move up a bit, you move a bit, not getting too close as you don't want to get hit first, until someone gets bored and launches their pieces into free space (inviting first hits) and opens it up. Which drags the supposed 30 minute laughfest into a 90-120 minute affair - and flicking discs doesn't hold attention or enough interest for that long. Having said that, the theme and special powers (one off long range missile attacks, retaliation hits, regeneration if you don't kill off in one turn, etc) add a certain charm. Just not enough.

This is a good dexterity game with the fantasy infusion for a unique mix of fun.  People really enjoyed this game when it comes out.

I like the characters and the mix of different lords and minions.  There are many unique attacks.

The rooms are fine, however I wished there were more variations of them.  I also wish it provided suggested layouts and "difficulty" ratings for the setup.  The basic one provided seemed easy for the heroes.

I really need to incorporate the expansions into this game as well as using a map layout.  If using the base game only with the single path layout, it could eventually be repetitive.

6/21/13 - I've been waiting for this game forever but I gave up on it after a year of waiting.

It has some surprising strategic elements and plays really quickly. The Wizard is fun to play but the Thief seems pretty boring. I'm glad I picked this up and it was well worth the wait.

(10+ plays)  Bring a Barbarian, Thief, Wizard, and Elf into a dungeon and kill some big bad dungeon lord.  Sound familiar?  Except this time, it's a ton of tactical strategy mixed with action packed dexterity.  Really enjoyed the first couple of plays.  Fun!

This is the first boardgame that has achieved the feel of the best dungeoneering video games.  A wizard with a deck of spell cards, an elf flicking around arrows, a berserking barbarian.  I'm having as much fun with this as I did with Gauntlet in the arcade way back when.

Flicking dungeon crawler. Very simple, and quick to play. I think this will scratch that itch for the dungeon experience when we don't want to sit and play Descent or Castle Ravenloft. I played two player against my wife and it really felt this is the best way to go, as that removes issues about player elimination. Not sure I would get an expansion for the game, I think the flicking is variable enough that no two games would feel the same.

A very unique system, and quite enjoyable in its simplicity.  It absolutely screams to be expanded upon.  New monsters, new heroes, new items, new rooms, new boards, etc...

I have some concerns regarding balance.  It sure does seem like the heroes need to make very few mistakes if they have any chance of winning.  Two games in a row, the heroes didn't even make it to the Boss room.  

Some house rules are being discussed. :)

Now this is something a bit special. It's a dungeon crawl with a fantasy theme but that's where the sanity of the concept kind of ends. Bits and pieces fly all around the room. This puck is a mage, this puck is a fireball, and this puck is a monster. Fireball flies off the board and gets deflected back on the board after hitting the game masters belly and a pint of beer on the way towards a its obviously intented target. All this was pure skill, because I'm the next best thing to Hawkeye. Fun kind of starts to wind down at the point when the GM starts playing seriously and the game reveals its true nature: it's hard like diamonds even though the quality of the components maybe isn't quite there.

I don't know what to say. It's not the best thing ever but the novelty value is off the damn roof even though I was flicking little cars on a racing track scooped into a sandbox as a little boy. It's just kind of. I don't know. Try it and see it yourself. I'm kind of confused... It's kind of... Cool? Ish? That's all I've got to say.

After playing a game of Crokinole, I thought this game would totally suck: no smooth polished wooden surface, no rails on the board, and lots and lots of fiddly rules inherent in dungeon crawler themed games.

However, the genius is not that the designer merged a dungeon crawler and a dexterity game. It's that the designer created a dexterity-co-operative game. This means that even if you have one player telling people what to do, there's always a potential someone will screw up.

This game is really a lot of fun - much more than a gimmick or novel idea.  There is a surprising amount of thought to the meshing of the theme with the mechanics and it plays out really well.  And even though my wife didn't necessarily "love" the theme, it's one of the few fantasy-themed games I have that she liked.  Great game!  


After a couple of plays of the base game (2nd printing), I'm looking forward to getting the expansion to the table soon.

Oh man!  Catacombs says it's a dexterity dungeon crawl that is tons of fun and plays in less than an hour. And that's exactly what it is.  But it's not only dexterity (although it's mostly dexterity).  There is a lot of strategic placement of heroes/monsters and deciding who/what to attack first.  Mostly though, it's fast, delightful dexterity.  I can see myself playing Catacombs for a long time.

I put in a number of sessions as a playtester on this game and am thoroughly impressed with it.  Its disc flicking mechanics are unique and the implementation allows for a great social atmosphere.
Weight-wise it is definitely on the lighter side, which allows for a fast paced game that doesn't get bogged down with extraneous rules or between-turn downtime.
Although some may not like dexterity based games, it is difficult not to have a good time even with a lack of skill (Aron).

Pitch-car with monsters. This is a very routine dungeon crawl game, like Hero-Quest/Descent/Talisman etc but not as good. The 'hook' is that when players enter a room the monsters and players are placed onto a board and players flick them about to hit each other.

That bit is quite a lot of fun. Characters are flicked at their opponents and score a hit if they contact. This actually has a fair bit of tactical depth. On the other hand its put togethor so the rules actively encourage players to play badly. It is not light enough overall to make it a party game but not really robust enough for players to play it competitively.

16-05-2014. Rated after 1 game. In this game the designers basically combined crokinole with Descent. I like both games a lot, but the mix to me is unfortunately a little less interesting.

In the game you are a party of adventurers (disks) that can use melee attacks (flick the character disk) or ranged/magic attacks (flick small melee disks) at enemies, while obstacles are avoided in order to face off with a boss in the end.

Problem with these games -for me- is that I always feel a lack of control. So basically the activity of disk flicking is too random for a game with decision making and thus reverts imho into more of an activity than a game. This game does it less than for example Rampage, but still enough for me that I like it, I would play it, but I do not feel the need to own it.

Two Player Value = Good.  Better with more.

Three Player Value = Good.  Better with more.


Catacombs is a fantastic dexterity game of dungeoneering.  That is an odd mixture of mechanics, but they actually work very well together.

Catacombs works primarily with a puck flicking mechanic exactly like Crokinole.  The board is the dungeon.  Pucks are used to represent each character and monster.  One player is the the Overseer who controls the monsters.  The other players are the Heroes.  The Heroes and monsters all have special abilities which are handled with cards and additional pucks. 

Combat is handled by players flicking their pucks to hit enemy pucks.  Each contact to an enemy puck is a hit.  Card abilities can be used to increase damage and add effects.

The players must work together and fight their way through the levels of the dungeon, and the hordes of monsters, to face the Overseer in a final showdown.  

This brings an excellent mechanic of player cooperation to the game.  But it also brings in a very well done mechanic of competitiveness and player elimination.  Those together make it feel like dungeoneering.  And that is why this game is good.  It maintains the feel of a dungeon crawler and adds the silly fun flicking dexterity mechanic.

There is a simple system for bettering characters.  No real leveling, but you can buy items to help your character.  Many of the items are truly useful and beneficial.  The heroes will want the items.

Overall that is the beauty of this game.  Excellent design with simple mechanics and fun game play.  Hard to ask for more.

The components are all very nice.  The wooden pucks have very detailed stickers to represent each hero and monster.  The cards are nice as well.

The theme works amazingly well.  It seems odd to have a dungeoneering game blended with a dexterity game, but the theme just works fantastically.  

The rules are easy to follow and much of the game simply makes sense.  Playing is simple and easy.  Players will learn quickly.  



Pros -

Instead of the dice in a more traditional dungeon crawl, there's a skill element: and yet with the irregularities in the board, there's still a randomness there that seems appropriate.

A Dungeon dexterity game. It's interesting to play with RPG goers. There are immense scenario events and cool magical effect and nasty creatures. The action element will heat your blood as you feel so into the scene. The balance is also pretty great, in many occasions either side grabs a very narrow victory. However the Dungeon Lord should have some sense to dictate the game tempo (avoiding being too 'conservative' to strike, that would leave the heros no room to attack).

RATING: 7
An interesting take on the flicking game genre. I suspect it's quite niche - it involves much more rules then classics like Crockinole and Carrom, thus its target become regular rather then casual gamers, while at the same time it doesn't offer any meaningful decisions that would appeal to them. After my couple of games I feel that the game is noticeably imbalanced, favoring the adventurers. Last but not least, the flicking aspect is less the ideal - the cardboard board is of greater friction then wooden, dedicated boards, while at the same time being much smaller and offering no band around it, resulting in numerous excursions under the sofa in search for a lost disk.

RATING: 7
This is a neat idea, Crokinole meets D&D, I suppose. You can play this with two to five players, one person taking on the "evil" role, and the others sharing four hero characters. Catacombs is a dexterity game where you flick pieces about a map containing "bumper" blocks. The pieces represent people, creatures and spell effects. For example, the elf, who is an medium to large piece, gets two arrows per combat, represented by small yellow discs. The elf can melee attack, by flicking the elf piece and hopefully "knocking" an enemy piece, or putting an arrow disc next to the elf and flicking that. Contact results in hit point damage. The heroes have to get through several rooms to win, culminating in a big fight with the big bad, so they have many hit points. Monsters generally have 1 or 2.

This game is screaming for expansions. The wizard can cast spells (fireball, teleport, healing, etc), the thief can flick escape and he misses, and the barbarian can go into a rage that gives him several attacks but stuns him for one turn. Very compelling idea. However, and there's no getting around this, I suck at flicking games. I have the dexterity of a deranged penguin in the desert. Ah well.

A lot more fun than it sounds or deserves to be. There is some nice discussion and strategizing that usually goes on with the heroes, which keeps it from being a mindless flicking exercise that often ensnares games in this genre. The idea is a little too simple, bordering on ridiculous, but the design of different monsters and characters fleshes it out, and the considerate dungeon structure, variability of enemies etc disguises the ridiculous design, immerses you in the theme, and doesn't make you think, "Hey I'm flicking a piece and pretending I'm an Elf!", but instead, "I'm an Elf!". 

Only complaint I have is the health track and "pillar" obstacles. The health cubes and pillar obstacles fly all over the place during the game, and some better way to tie them down would be appreciated. The health cubes are especially annoying, since they're so small and can be hard to track down if they get smacked off the table.

1st Edition

Excellent dexterity meets dungeoncrawl. A DM controls bad guy wooden discs and heroes flick their discs and spells, etc to kill baddies. Each fantasy archetype has linked special abilities. EG: the wizard can flick fireball discs etc. The Barbarian goes into a rage (continuous flicking and then he gets exhausted etc).

Different room cards, monsters and overlord monster gives variety. Feels like it runs for a touch too long...perhaps removing one level 1 card might help. Game balance is not bad and perhaps rewards skill. A good overlord will kill the players.

Graphics are amateurish at best. Some board backgrounds are downright garish. Otherwise, good effort overall.

Catacombs is a great little Fantasy themed Dexterity game. The game seems pretty well balanced thus far after four plays with the heroes winning two games and the catacomb lord winning two games. Of course, this depends on the skill and ability of the players to work together. I was a little perturbed by the moldy pieces, but I wiped them off and they are fine now. The quality of the components is also quite good. I am very happy with this game so far. Hopefully, an expansion will hit soon that adds more characters, monsters, catacomb lords, items, etc..

RATING: 9.5
Most dungeon crawls suffer from the comparison to RPGs.  As much as I love a good hack and slash, invariably I ask whether I'd rather just be playing D&D.  Because this is so far removed from the world of dice, it stands on its own.  In fact, I was asking myself whether RPGs should use this system rather than dice.

I would never play Descent over this.

This is the best thing to come down the pipe in years.

Excellent dexterity dungeon crawler with gorgeously quirky art. There's enough meat here to satisfy gamers wanting a longer game and yet the dexterity component makes it casual-gamer friendly.

A flicking dungeon crawl game. It's actually a tactical combat flicking game with a dungeon theme: the overlord player plays against everyone else. It sounds like a great idea, and it was kind of fun. However, it went on a bit too long for me -- I think I'd rather play Taktika.

--- Summary ---
Each game involves playing through several rooms, each with a different setup (obstructions layout, monsters available). Players generally start on one edge of the board, then the Overlord places monsters. Players flick first, in any order; then Overlord. Mostly making 1-HP melee attacks (flick your token into another to inflict damage), although some attacks inflict 2 hits, or can stun for 1 turn. Missile attacks involve flicking a smaller token from within 1" of attacker -- everything hit gets damaged (usually 1 HP). Players have many HP. Most monsters have 1HP, stronger ones have 2HP, bosses have more. There is other flavor as well -- items and spells that give players additional options. The players win only if they manage to kill the boss.

RATING: 6
I like the combination of dexterity game and dungeon crawl.  It's innovative and fun and actually works well.  It's learned and plays fast so it is perfect as a filler or gateway.

I think the game boards are a bit smaller than they should be to really open this game up.  The component quality in my copy was also lacking, a lot of the wooden disks were odd warped shapes and the board in my new copy was already damaged.  Everything just feels cheap and looks it too.  The colorless pencil art on colored backgrounds is awful and the art by itself is pretty ugly anyway.  I also feel like this is way too easy for a cooperative game, even in the level 2 and catacomb lord rooms.

It's still goofy quick fun though and perhaps the expansions will open the game up and make it more challenging and interesting (though most likely at the cost of some more play time).  I'm overly critical of lighter games because I like more meat but I think I can give this one some leeway since it fits a niche my collection is short on.

I've since decided I'm not really a fan of playing dexterity games.  I like the idea of them but when I actually sit down and play they never turn out like I want them to and they almost always leave me disappointed.

It's a really excellent game that plays so much better than it sounds. It also seems to appeal to people who aren't into gaming in general, as everyone can "get" the basic flicking mechanic.

RATING: 7
I never would have thought a dexterity game could be this much fun.  As much as I tend to hate simple games, in this case the simplicity works because you have to select your actions based on how skillful and dexterous you think you really are.  An excellent game for anyone who's not afraid to pull away from the brain-burners and put some actual skill to the test.  I absolutely enjoy playing this with my friends' preteens and young teenagers because they really get into the game.  As my friend's 11 year old said, "You mean there's a game out there where we're SUPPOSED to hit the pieces all around the table?  SICK!!"  Every now and then you just want to take a break from all the strategy games and play something that feels like nothing else, and what better way to do it than with a bunch of sugar-hopped kids swarming the board?

Catacombs is designed to appeal on more than one level, but for a dexterity game, I'd rather play Elk Fest, Tumblin' Dice or Carabande, and for tactical fantasy combat I'd prefer Claustrophobia, HeroScape or DungeonQuest. I simply can't see Catacombs hitting the table that often at my house.

Note - I only played once, so don't take my rating too seriously. Then again, I had no [i]interest[/i] in playing a 2nd time, and traded it away. I seriously recommend trying it before buying.

Great theme play.  Easy to learn and play.  Nice coop with good strategy play.  The party players need to use their character abilities wisely to make it through the dungeon.  Components are very good - mounted room boards, wood playing pieces with stickers and cardstock character sheets.  Artwork is fairly colorful and nice.  Game length is nice at about 1 hour.

RATING: 7
[Sands of Time Games 2010 edition] {Dexterity, adventure; flicking; optimal 2p/5p} Catacombs is a fun and thematic game. It's special in that it is a dexterity RPG game. Replayability is fine due to the many room cards and several Catacomb lords. The game experience is engaging and fun, esp. it really creates an atmosphere of RPG adventuring.  Flicking skill is important, but not deciding; however, good flicking skills of Overseers is certainly an advantage :)

Player interaction is good.  Collaboration between player is important to win the game, esp. in fully utilizing the strength of each character.

However, I think it's bias for the hero players. The Overseer has fewer options to make the game much challenging. Maybe, it would be better with the expansions - which I haven't studied.

Catacombs has a problem.  It lacks a storyline.  The game experience would be better if the Overseer can build a storyline among the rooms; however, for each game, it is just a random setup of rooms.  The atmosphere of adventuring / solving mystery is very lacking.  It becomes "let's clear this room!”, rather than let's complete an adventure.  I think house-rules or special preparation is needed to make the game even more interesting. 

The quality of components is good: sturdy boards, thick cards and handy materials.  I prefer coins to cards.

Just got Catacombs last night, and had a friend rush over to play. Wow, that was fun! I love the new art - vibrant colors, great style. We played through two times, being overlord once each. Seems like it's a hard win for the heroes. Too hard, maybe? I tried playing with my left hand as the overlord to offset some of the advantages, but that didn't help much either. Might have to figure out some variant to help the heroes a little.

This was quite clever and enjoyable.  I think that it would be a keeper, but I'm afraid it would get kind of old after a while.  Some extra characters, and more items to purchase might be able to make it fresher.  But even that could get tiring after a while.

Dexterity + Dungeon Crawl = Awesome. The game runs a little long due to Analysis Paralysis but when the action is going on it's a lot of fun.

RATING: 5.5
1 vs many dungeon crawler with flicking?  I'm intrigued, but how does it play?  In short, unsatisfyingly.

My complaints boil down to three main points:
1) The game is too long.  Given it was a learning game, but it took us 2 hours.  This sort of game should be 1 hour max.
2) The available heroes are hilariously unbalanced.  In particular, some heroes only get a single flick as their standard action.  This leaves little room for strategy and makes it painfully easy to avoid their attacks.
3) The game pretty much only plays with 2 or 3.  Since there is 1 DM and the 4 heroes are split between the remaining players, with 4 or 5 players you only control a single hero.  That would be quite boring, especially since your hero could get killed and you might sit out an entire encounter or two.

RATING: 7
Good flicking game. The problem of shooting pieces off the table is not as bad as I thought - sometimes you hold an arm next to the board to stop them and that's it. The greater difficulty is to see which pieces were hit. If you play for the fun and not for the winning, this is not much of a problem, though. The play time can be adjusted by adding or removing rooms. However, expect some people who just find out that they hate flicking games in your game group. The heroes were usually clueless about tactics. The dungeonmaster can just flick carelessly, but the other players are under some pressure to spare some of their hitpoints, which can be either a nice challenge or a frustating stress test.

My moldy pieces were replaced as soon as Sands of Time knew about me, but it took some time for my internet game store to contact them.

Catacombs is a fun-filled dexterity game that has a specific appeal to old school fantasy roleplayers. The game is accessible to non-gamers and heavy gamers alike since it just comes off as being lots of fun. Those very proficient at Crokinole can quickly unbalance the game if up against non-dexterity game veterans and not all of the characters give the same level of involvement in the game. However, the game has a lot of variants posted from the designers and is crying out for expansions that will be great additions and not at all feel unnecessary. Skill levels may separate some players, but ultimately, this is a fun game that will appeal to a broad base of gamers. And even though it is not an intuitive combination of theme to game mechanics, it works and it is a blast.

RATING: 4
Catacombs is the lovechild of two great games - Crokinole and Descent. Sadly the lovechild of two great games can turn out to be a fairly poor result. Catacombs is a game where one player is the overseer controlling all of the monsters on the dungeon board and the rest of the players are a team controlling heroes traveling through the dungeon to defeat an ultimate boss creature. All of the units are Crokinole discs of various sizes that the players flick around to attack each other. The game is very interesting in theory, but in practice the experience is compromised by the component quality, which is not overtly terrible by any means, but rather simply fair to poor. If you’re accustomed at all to a quality Crokinole board  then flicking discs on these flimsy boards with spaces for pillars that are frequently popping out won’t be nearly as satisfying. The game rules are also more simplistic than I’d like, losing a lot of the depth of Descent, by removing all of the nuance from movement, combat, and special abilities. I’d still like to try Taktika  some day, another combat-oriented flicking game, but for now I’m still searching for the game that expertly blends Crokinole and combat.

This is for the First Edition:

Fun little "flicking" game. My only real complaints are some of the graphic design is rather odd and this game needs a way to stop the pieces from shooting all over the table.

Regarding the graphic design, the heroes need some color to help set them apart from one another. Some of the board backgrounds are rather strange looking, I would have prefered something that actually looks like rooms.

Regarding the pieces shooting all over the table, this game really needs a "moat" and edge system like the better Crokinole boards. I understand this would have increased the price and size of the game by alot, but as it is now frequently pieces fly off the board and into other pieces.

This is the weakest part of the game, constantly resetting pieces back onto the board that have been shot off. Most of my opponents are Crokinole players who are used to really shooting the pieces. Folks try for the banking shots and multiple hits, which means heavy shots, which means pieces flying off the board frequently. Sometimes it is hard keeping track of where each piece went off the board when multiple pieces are involved in a shot.

The other issue with hard shots is the grey discs used for obstacles are only set in holes in the board. These are fine to bank the arrows and smaller discs off, but the larger discs do not bank off them very well. The grey discs tend to shift in the holes when hit with the larger discs which causes the disc to lose momentum and rebound unpredictably.

I could easily see someone building a deluxe version of this game with (perhaps even larger) wooden boards, solid obstacles and an edge system. It really is a fun game, don't let these flaws scare you away!

Peace

Catacombs is an innovative game that takes the exhausted genre of fantasy dungeon crawls and twists it into a dexterity based party game of flicking wooden disks. Strangely it ends up becoming a great dungeon crawl game. I played the out of print older version with the charmingly awful artwork. At the end of a gaming night I brought it out to show the pals. While they watched a Shut up & Sit Down video review on Catacombs I put the stickers on the pieces and thought we'd just do one "encounter room" to test it out. It was late, I was tired. We ended up playing a full game till like 1:30 in the morning. There was lots of comedy when players would screw up. At one point a friend fell out of her chair. It was a great end of the night game after you've had a few drinks and a have already played a heavy strategy game. It will wake you up for your drive home. 

I'd give it a 9 or 10 for the pure fun of playing but I have issues with the artwork/design and an truly terrible manual. I predict the new redesigned edition will fix these issues and be an even better game all around. It's looking great so far on Kickstarter. New art, bigger board. Fund the Kickstarter. Just do it.

I love dexterity games and this is a very interesting concept.

As the host I play as the DM.  Perhaps it is a combination of poor game balance or a skill gap between myself and the other players but I find the DM is very overpowered.  It's too easy to target a single player and eliminate them by mid game.  It's easy to wrap up after that.  That's not fun for either me or the players.  So as the DM my goal is to enhance the fun of the other players.  So I tend to share the damage.  This impacts my fun as the DM slightly but worth it to boost other players' enjoyment.

I suppose it just isn't my sort of game. Although I do like flicking games and will play Taktika, Ascending Empires or Pitch Car anytime, this was miserable. The chrome doesn't add decision making space, it just adds time.

RATING: 5
A somewhat interesting way to mix a dexterity game and a dungeon crawl, but I think the mesh doesn't work well enough to really justify it.  Playing a separate dexterity or dungeon crawl game would generally be better to me.

It also doesn't help that the boards are, well, normalish game boards which don't really have the nice smooth surfaces you want for a flocking game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's hard to say how much better the game would be with a larger board and better components. Things slide much better than in Ascending Empires, but the pieces glide as well as wood on cardboard can be expected to.

It'd be great to see what this would be like with a better publisher.

very fun experience.  don't seem to get a lot of opportunities to play it, not sure why.  i do think the artwork is pretty weak, especially on the boards.  looks like something i would do in power point if i needed a full page of chaotic colors and only had 10 seconds to choose something.

Not a deep game, but AMAZINGLY fun. It's extremely exciting to play but you will want to play with a total of 5 people (1 for each class, and one to play the Overlord) you can play this game with less, but I personally find that either two players take on two hero's, or four players each take one hero makes for the best games.

For a flicking game, it's good.  Unfortunately, that qualifier robs the statement of any real power.  I don't really love flicking games, and this one isn't going to do anything to change my mind.  Sure, it's innovative, and it's interesting to see what they did with it, but in the end, it's still another "four stock guys go into a dungeon and try to slay a bunch of baddies."  I kind of want a few other twists.  The monsters are mostly pretty boring.  Could use some more story or theme.  Not really sure about the replayability of this game, as the rooms start to seem same-y after even one game.

The idea behind this game is genius.  A dexterity dungeon crawl!  Brilliant!  I love the theme, I love, the pieces.  I enjoyed the game play a lot but...  I think the balance of the game felt a little tilted toward the overseer.  I think some house rules to allow the players another opportunity to heal some damage may address it.  I am eager to try it out again with a few little tweaks.  Overall, this is a brilliant design.

UPDATE: Husband has fired Catacombs because he'd prefer to play Crokinole :( I like both games, but there we are... For trade... Sob... :(

Based on one play. Great fun flicking game. It's light, brilliant to play when tired, but has enough strategy to be entertaining. 

Seems balanced two player. The heroes lost, but the hero player (husband) isn't as good at flicking as me! 

I want to play again! Always a good sign! Game took 30 minutes to an hour. I barely noticed the dire art.

The board didn't feel too small. It's a game which uses small accurate flicks, not power shots.

Woot!  Flicking meets a dungeon crawler meets one-against-many meets a semi-strategic game.  It's certainly a novel idea, and one that works remarkably well.  There seems to be a neat balance of strategy versus tactics, for both sides, as well as a lot of replayability with the way the dungeon is set up each game.  It has a nice potential, and lacks some of the tedium that one finds in Ascending Empires.  Both games have good qualities, but if I had to pick one over another, I would probably go with Catacombs.

The rules aren't very well organized, or even all that clear (we had a handful of rules questions in our first game where we just had to make our best judgment on the situation), but that's really the only failing I see of the game at this time, and that's definitely fixable with some player aids.

Catacombs is an action/dexterity based adventure board game. One player controls the Overseer, controlling the monsters of the catacombs. The other player(s) control the four heroes who cooperatively try to defeat the monsters and eventually the Catacomb Lord. Each of the heroes have special abilities that must also be used effectively if they are to prevail.
\13\\13\
The main mechanic of Catacombs is for the players to flick wooden discs representing the monsters and the heroes. Contact with an opposing piece inflicts damage but missiles, spells, and other special abilities can cause other effects. When all of the monsters of a room have been cleared, the heroes can move further into the catacomb. Items and equipment upgrades can be purchased from the Merchant with gold taken from fallen monsters. The Catacomb Lord is the final danger that the heroes must defeat to win the game. Conversely, the Overseer wins if all of the heroes are defeated.

Amusing, harmless, nothing to take too seriously. Some of the special effect rules are too involved/wordy (shorthand or summary text on the monster card would be better).

I disliked the two-hit limit on monsters, as it left few interesting tactical options. Some of that stems from the 1-inch firing option radius for ranged attacks. That's just too much flexibility, and makes it too hard to set up difficult shots.

But overall, minor gripes, would play again.

I quite like the co-operative aspect, but find that it is competitive enough to be stimulating. The only part of the game I did not like (enough to affect my rating of it) is the flicking. I find it irritating and extremely difficult- I'm just not good at aiming or judging my own strength. I suppose that if I practice and improve, I will like this game better.

More strategy (and camaraderie) than expected in terms of disk placement and advanced planning.  All players fully enjoyed the experience, although it isn't clear that the Big Boss resolution was completely satisfactory.

That isn't to say that the Boss lair - complete with hordes of monster bodyguards - wasn't sufficiently challenging.  It's just that, once the bodyguards were eliminated, the remaining free-for-all with the single boss disk was more plodding than thrilling.

But even the slowdown during the game's final flicks couldn't quash the lingering emotional high from the first 96% of the game.  So hey, support your local independent creators and give this one a shot.

After 1 Play: I put aside my general dislike of cooperative games to try this, because the concept sounded interesting and I like dexterity games.  

The first problem is that there's just too much downtime (we played with a full compliment of 5).  
The second problem is the uneven characters - uneven not in terms of power, but in terms of interest.  I played the thief, who I think must be the most boring character to play, but it seems like all the characters are pretty uninteresting next to the wizard.

Overall, an interesting idea that just doesn't work out in practice.

This game really needed a far larger board/play area. It would probably have benefitted from having no board at all, and have players utilise the entire table space itself.

The artwork is iffy in places, and average at its best. Most of the floor patterns look like Christmas wrapping paper!

As is, the small and confined boards really hinder the flicky nature of the game. This removes a lot of the powershots & long skill type shots, which are prevalent in other 'superior' dexterity type games, such as Elk Fest, Taktika and Pitchcar. To me Catacombs feels way too tame, as play often amounts to nothing but stagnant, huddled, feeble nudging.

There is also far too much clunky bookkeeping and downtime involved, for what at heart should be a simple/quick/fun dexterity style game.

For me the 'keeping track' became tiresome. It detracted & slowed down any action and pace far too much.

The most fun we had out of it was using the pieces to play Tocce.

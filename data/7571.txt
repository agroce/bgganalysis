Quite a good game that meshes reasonably well with the pirate theme. Except for the bit about voting for the direction of the wind. That's just plain weird (although an effective game mechanic).

Whilst this is a reasonablly good game, it's not as good as I hoped it would be.  It's certainly not as much pure fun as Pirate's Cove, and I wouldn't say it was any less random overall...perhaps it is in some areas.  However, it certainly gives the impression of being a deeper game than PC - but this is only partly true and is also a slightly bogus notion (the combat and strategies for winning in PC are more varied).  

One of the things that's good is that you can partly control your destiny  by either playing to collect as many buried treasure cards as possible and going mainly for gusts of wind with your action points, or you can aim to keep the Blackbeard card and keep ahead in wind cubes so that you can mostly get your way about where you sail to.  Whichever path you take, thinking carefully about area port bonuses is important.

Getting your ship just as you want it is NOT easy because there are a lot of "take that" cards...well maybe slightly too many.  Perhaps a future card expansion will allow owners of the game to mix and match action cards.  If so, I'd have a few more positive ones in.

Above all what I think this game lacks, and what maybe someone at GMT should have suggested at the testing stage is a couple of optional combat rules.  Had there been some, I think those who wanted a bit more blood, guts, fun and theme would have been satisfied and those who wanted the game kept simple could have ignored them.  Maybe I'll get around to knocking something up myself.  It would go something like this:

Intermediate Optional Boarding Combat Rule - when boarding is attempted both ships roll a die.  The level of cannons is added to the combat roll and if the attacker wins, he gets to plunder, if he loses, nothing happens (nothing too radical here, but it just adds an element of excitement, uncertainty and the foibles of war).

Advance Optional Boarding Combat -
as above, but a self-created smallish pack (say of 12) cards could be used to influence battle.  These cards would not be dissimilar to those in Pirate's Cove.  You could have one for free every time you bought 2 (or maybe 3) Action cards in one turn.  So you might have a grape shot to increase you fire by +2...or something like that.

I'll play this a lot more I'm sure, but I was kind of hoping it may be a 9 out of 10 game, and I fear it isn't.  Maybe it'll rise to an 8 with further plays.  I hope so.  I hope it doesn't fall to a 6!

Right now, I'd say it's worth a 7. I may be disappointed but I did have pretty high expectations here and Winds of Plunder is certainly not a bad pirate game, and is indeed better than many of the other pirate games out there.  It is also very easy to learn and the box, board and bits are of really good quality.  It's fun and scratches a certain Euro-Pirate itch.  The bottom line is, though, that it's not as good as it could have been, and I think the overly-maligned Pirate's Cove (which is it's nearest rival) is a better game and provides more theme and fun.

sounded great during the rules explanation.  i didn't quite understand it when the game was said to possibly have a poor get poorer problem, because i hadn't yet encountered that in a game.  wow, i get it now!  in this one you pick on people, but especially the little guy.  in a 5 player game the lowest one on the totem poll cannons-wise got pounded by everyone at the table and quickly forced into a non-confrontational and basically decisionless style of play.  lots of take that, which i don't mind, but i don't like that cannons seem to decide so much and the extra sailing turn card seems grossly overpowered.  i'll still give props to gmt for a surprisingly decent quality production, and i would actually play it again with 3 or 4 players just to give it another twirl.  i suspect that with strictly experienced players things could improve in terms of take-that balance, which explains getting it out of playtesting, but i doubt i'll ever get that far with it.

I saw this game being played and there seems to be quite a bit of downtime.  It is one of those Action-point systems, which the game state changes dramatically by the time it gets to you.  This makes planning very hard and slows down the game.  I talked to the people playing it afterwards and they agreed with my comments.  Also, this pirate game is pretty abstracted and just doesn't do a good job of invoking the "piratey" feel.  With these kinds of games that makes or breaks the game.  So this game is off of my watch/buy list and now hoping that Blackbeard will not dissapoint.

Played once with 3 players with the rules explained to me.  Winds of Plunder reminded me of a cross between El Capitan and Pirate's Cove.  I like the idea of upgrading your ship and gaining certain advantages for having the most of something.  I found the cards very random, but at the same time amusing.  Normally I dislike "take that cards" but since this game has a set number of rounds, targeting the leader fortunately does not prolong the game.

RATING: 7.5
I've enjoyed the two games I've played of this, although I think the 4-player version was slightly better, if only because it jived along a bit quicker.  I'm very curious as to how this plays with three players, as it might end up being optimal.

The only reason I don't rate this a solid 8 is because I suspect it might not be the easiest game to get on the table, because nobody seemed overly enthused about it after we had finished.  I enjoy playing it, but would probably only try to crack out a game every once in a while.

Suffice to say, my feelings on this one is mixed.  Although turns aren't real complicated, there's a fair amount of bookkeeping involved since you have to keep fiddling with the little cubes on the four tracks of the board, and your VP marker, and your wind cubes, and your wind cube reserve, and all your cards, and your treasure cards...

Will probably refine opinion/rating after a few more games.


***UPDATE***
No bones about it, this is a three-player game.  A rather enjoyable three-player game, as well, which is fortuitous since I don't own many that fit those criteria.

RATING: 8
Very intersting. I started out thinking this was a dry euro with a tacked-on pirate theme but in fact it ends up as a game with lots of interaction and a very piratey feel - helped by the random element introduced by the cards. Scoring is nicely balanced between building up resources for the long game or taking short term benefit. So although some of the mechanisms seem odd to start with (bidding for wind direction) this actually ends up being an all round enjoyable game with lots of 'take that'.

Fantastic implementation of theme...this game is so good I'd rate it a 10, but if I played it all the time it would get old. I like to savor it as an occasional treat. I wrote and extensive session report and review; check it out in the Winds of Plunder Forum!

Not sure on this one. Game is all about management of your wind cubes - spending them is a blind bid. Action cards and treasure maps throw a big random element in the mix, but there is some control. Downtime is a bit of an issue as you can't really plan your turn during others as things change so much.

** Updated, traded my copy ages ago, got talked into playing it again as I'd rated it a '7' ... what was I thinking back then ... ?? Must be a reason it got traded. Dropped rating to a 5, it's ok, but not very piratey and I'll happily not play it again!

After 4 games (3 and 4 player):
Nice Pirate game with Euro-Elements (Blind Wind-Cube Bidding, Area Majority, no Dice, low complexity rules but multilayer gameplay). Playable in 60 minutes. The priate theme is a little abstract here. Beware of the powerful cards which can really hurt your rivals.
Only thing I`am missing some cards which could be played out of order.
Production quality is top notch. GMT has proofed they can produce a quality board; go on. 
Edit: The offical variant in the rules, which raises the importance of the wind bidding is recommended.

Great pirate Euro from GMT. A gamer's Pirate's Cove. Make no mistake, this game is pure Euro, essentially a pirate-themed point-generator, with a unique bid for wind direction. A touch of chaos is added via the fun Action cards (a lot of Take That!). Regardless, our games have all finished very close in points, often a one or two point margin of victory! That is the hallmark of a fine Euro.

This is a euro, disguised as a pirate game. If that 'floats your boat' you will love this. For me, the 'piratey' nature lacks a little. I get more immersed in the pirate world when playing Pirate's Cove then when playing this... but this has more game to it.  The fights in Pirate's Cove are much better. In WoP the fights are simply... take one resource from you and give it to me... fight done. 

It's a good game, but for me, I'm thinking of ways to maximize my victory points rather than sporting an eye patch and grunting out a string of ARRRRs.

The components are nice enough, but I'm not a fan of the clip-art, vector graphics feel of this game (similar to GMT grahpics which I just don't get a warm fuzzy over)

To be grossly stereotypical, like many recent American and English games, this sort of feels like an American trying to emulate a German, but without particular success. So it's got an auction, and a very abstract movement system, but it's got take-that cards that force you to be nasty and kingmaking too, and a number of pointy edges.

The abstract bits aren't interesting from a gameplay perspective, the game overall isn't thematic or evocative, the pace of the game is thoroghly pedestrian with just enough downtime to be irritating (plus it's too long), and one makes few interesting decisions. Everything you do is worth about 3 or 4 points, and there is little to no competition for resources, so scores are always close and it comes down to the take-that cards it seems. People say they like the wind system, and it is mechanically clever, but it's the worst kind of mechanically clever - the kind that doesn't turn into interesting player decisions or tension. 

It feels like something Avalon Hill might have done in the early 90s, when they were first experimenting with designing more abstract but still thematic strategy games, but not as good. The end result is a game that works but doesn't engage. It works well enough that if you play with fun people, you will have fun, but from any angle you look at this, whether it's theme, mechanics, fun factor, whatever, there is far better stuff out there. For pirate games, I have to say I liked Rum & Pirates better.

Where's the swashbuckling and other fun piratey things!?!  The game is about sailing around the board to collect victory point chits, big whoop.  The bidding for wind direction is main mechanic, which seems kind of boring to me.  Seriously, a pirate game where bidding for wind direction is the main mechanic?  Fun piratey things like boarding are present, but are just dull "I have more cannons than you so I win" scenarios.  Blech.

Really solid box and lovely linen finish on the board. The rules summaries are excellent. The box art is rather piecemeal, though. The 'take-that' gameplay works well enough but might not suit everyone. The fights are dull. Some randomness and / or use of the crew would make it more interesting. Pirate battles were, after all, about boarding and taking other ships, not just about firing your guns at them.

Jan. 14, 2008 -- My first play was as  a two-player game just to get a feel for the rules, and while it was clear to me the game was interesting and fun, it was obvious why the game isn't billed as a two-player game.

My second play was a four-player game, and that went over spectacularly. While it's essentially a Euro in many ways, it's a Euro done the GMT way. There's a healthy dose of screwage in the cards that departs from the design of most Euros, and I think that's really what makes the game.

Winds of Plunder is a clever, fun game that I'd highly recommend, especially if you're looking for a game with a pirate theme. 8/10

RATING: 6
I really like games like this.  Unclear choices every turn on what to do.  Doesn't really feel piratey, but it does have elements of Pirates!.  The wind element is a little weird, but interesting.  Pretty easy to pick up.  There is a lot of randomness in the cards, which I can see is going to really influence the game, but if you can look past that and have fun pirating this will be a good game.

A true Eurogame. Although one of few pirate games, 'Winds of Plunder' fails for me. The theme feels pasted on and the game mechanics are colorless in contrast to the potential a pirate theme offers. Especially the 'wind voting' is a quite odd and feels very arbitrary. It is not outright bad, but I think I won't try it again.

Though it seemed interesting, I wanted turn 9 to pop up before it's time. Maybe the decision making in the game was too obvious. Maybe the poor demo components put me off (thanks for bringing that up Charles, now I'm second guessing my comments).

RATING: 7
I do like this game, but the concept of bidding for which way the wind blows is just crazy and pulls you out of the game (and the theme). We've had to re-describe this as the Pirate Captains voting on who gets to leave harbor first IF the wind should happen to blow in "this" direction. Then after the bidding is won, the turn represents the next time that the wind did indeed happen to blow in "this" direction. Not very helpful, but at least the mechanic doesn't pull us out of the game. This games seems to be an example of a designer having a great idea for a mechanic, but no theme to match it well... so why not just paste it into the next game design. Good game, crazy mechanic.

A great game that really captures the theme nicely - though its the other players more than nature who provide the chaos. Based off one 5 player session, I have a feeling 4 players is the sweet spot for the first few plays (we had a lot of downtime as we studied card text). In terms of strategy, it seems pretty wide open - also appears that you could make a nice living just plundering other players - just like a pirate should

I played this at the GMT Weekend and I would say it is a good solid eurogame.  The components meet the German standards (yes there are colored wooden bits and a scoring track around the perimeter of the board) and the gameplay is quite engaging with a nice level of player interaction.  One thing I like in particular is that when you do plunder your pirate buddies, it's more of an annoyance than a crippling effect.  Good balance there.  Recommended.

There are many good things to say about this excellent new game from GMT: high quality components and packaging, clear and concise rules, that distinctive, semi-sparse, GMT graphic presentation (which appeals to me) and, of course, a good gaming experience.

Winds of Plunder is definitely am Americanized Euro-style game. Wood cubes, voting, abstracted combat, luck restricted to card draws... it's all there. But somehow the designer and excellent development of this game hoisted it well-above most Euros in the freshness of the play. We had a great experience first time out and even one dyed-in-the-wool Euro hater was positive and stated that if there were more Euros like this one he'd have a much higher opinion of the genre.

Played twice, once with 4 players and once with 5.  I think I prefer to 4 player game, although having the extra player was interesting as the board was more crowded.  This is a game where you crawl to victory on the backs of your opponents, always looking for an opportunity to hit a soft target or take down the leader.  If that doesn't work for you, move on, although it seems very appropriate given the pirate theme.

My first thought was that I can't believe these are GMT components. Mounted board, and chunky bits. Very nice. fun game too - well balanced with lots of decisions and strategies. Reminded me of elements of El Grande and a Game of Thrones.--ON further play I find the random nature of the card decks to be annoyingly decisive. Still a fun game, but don't take too long to decide what to spend that action point on...

RATING: 7.5
Pretty good game. My favourite aspect of the game is that there's lots to do every round, yet the game is over in less than two hours. You get all sorts of mechanics (auctions, movement, plunder, card play, multiple paths to victory) but I wouldn't say that Winds of Plunder excels at any particular one. Still a lot of fun to play, but not quite memorable enough to be a top-10 game.

I enjoy this game very much with its strong theme and highly interactive cutthroat play, but the cards can be random.  I refuse to play it with 5 players as there's just too much chaos created from all sorts of cards that can be played on you between your turns.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Plays well with 3 players but I fear with more, being in the lead carries a dangerous price tag.  The leader becomes a magnet for all those cards that nip and snip resources.  Has enough good points for a few replays; we'll see if it stands the test of time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rating is for a 3 player game. With this number, the "bash the leader" aspect is not as important. It probably becomes way more difficult to take the lead with 5 players. Still, with 3, the strategies are quite well balanced and it is fun to go either for the treasure maps, the exploration or the various good tracks. A solid and engaging game with a rich theme. Update: The "Heave you scurvy dog!" card is overly powerful. This seems to have been acknowledged by the designer who put a lot of conditions on it, but it still throws the game when these conditions come up. Especially if they come up twice. I suggest you play without it.

Just a bit strange. Looks like a typical Euro, but has a very strange selection of special action cards - very useful, take that, and completely useless. For a game that wasn't very strategic in the end it took a long time.

RATING: 6
Winds of Plunder is definetly a euro, despite what other comments may suggest.  The pirate theming is pale, but that can be overlooked if you have spirited captains sitting around the table.  The mechanics meld together nicely and despite some comments suggesting too much down time, this game moves at a good clip and never bogs down.  Some interesting decisions to be made make this an amped up pirate's cove (similar feel with more substantial gaming).

The real meat of the game is in the bidding and the movement, which is not bad.  The action points seem pasted on and aren't very effective anyways.  The cards are not quite useless, but their play doesn't add anything to the game.  All in all, not a bad game, just one that has only one somewhat interesting part with a bunch of extra junk.  But why are these kinds of games getting released these days?  Stop wasting my time with your over-saturated gaming market!

Biding for wind... Are you kidding me?  This game is just pure-T awful.  I mess of random mechanics, screw your neighbor cards, and boring victory point bash the leader calculations, this game has no redeeming qualities.  Sure it works, but it's not fun at all.

RATING: 7
I thought this was pretty cool. Bidding on the wind direction is bizarre but I enjoyed the closed-fist auction nevertheless. I like the ship movement, which is constrained by wind direction, but also the player's desire for getting certain items, boarding or avoiding other ships, spreading renown, or just finishing a hunt for booty. All those desires will often pull you in different directions, making the choice quite interesting. The take-that card play is fun enough, and goes well with the theme. The cards are good but usually not so powerful that they absolutely hose the player on the receiving end. Quick moving turns, short play time, and high player interaction are pluses. Seems a little underrated to me.

While the Wind mechanics is a little silly, it does work well and the auction is never easy as you both compete for an individual win and a side win (i.e. if more than one voted for the same direction, your bids are added to know the wind direction).  There is even some bit of pillage and plundering!

The best pirate game I had ever played before trying Blackbeard.  (Admittedly a low standard.)  If I were more a fan of screwage I'd rate it higher, as there are some aspects to like, for example the auctions for wind direction.  But there's so much hostility in this game that it overwhelms everything else.  At least that's true to the spirit of historical piracy, which had more to do with greed and guns than the creation of future Disney characters.

It seemed to me that this was very much a hybrid between an American style game (high theme, attacking, special power cards) and a Euro (elegance of basic system, bidding, majority contests, races to complete competing goals). The original rule here concerns bidding on wind direction. Before I picked up the game I imagined a detailed grid where wind direction sent you along very specific paths. In fact wind direction is very broad - it sends you to general sections of the board, and on reading the rules it didn't seem all that interesting. In play it worked just fine. Players have varying goals for where in the board they need to be - to get completion bonuses, to find treasure, and to board and pillage their opponents. Further, it is easy to get boxed into a corner where unfavorable winds will be expensive to you.

A fairly simple but confrontational pirate game. Players sail around at the whim of the wind and try to collect as many provisions, weapons and crew as they can. The whole game is very take-that-ish, and players must be extremely aggressive in order to progress.

The bidding on wind direction felt very out-of-place, but the rest of the game flowed pretty smoothly. Its a good, light-hearted, middleweight game for gamers looking to unleash some pirate fury.

A really nejoyable first play. There are some interesting tactics I'd like to try out and everyone who played enjoyed the mechanics of play. I can see weaponry being used to bully too much and breaking th game abit. However I'll discover whether this is ever the case and if there are counters to this in future games.
UPDATE: Playing with the variant of most recent player to get to highest value having the card is by far the best way of playing it.

RATING: 3
Winds of Plunder runs much too long, has a lot of downtime, and is all about screwing the perceived leader or whoever has the most of a resource you want. To make matters worse, it has auctions where the losers also pay their bids. In the end I came out the winner of the game I played despite what I thought was poor play - a sure sign that this is not really a strategy game but more about experience/theme. Unlike many game players I do not become particularly engaged on the subject of piracy so that did not do anything for me either.

Not your typical pirate game as its a good bit "eurofied".  Wind auction mechanism determines direction ships may sail on their turn and everyone has the opportunity in their turn to use 3 action points as they wish.  Action cards are available which "break" the rules so to speak.  One can only attack another player if their ship is in the same port as an opponent and has more cannons.  I don't think I would play this game with less than 4 and it is likely best with 5.  You could probably choose to go through the whole game without ever attacking anyone and potentially do quite well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A nice Euro design with a Pirates theme. Well, not all mechanics are elegant: feels a little bit odd that the pirates [=players] bid on the wind conditions for the following action rounds. However, it still is an enjoyable game with nice mechanics and something of the theme is carried with the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Simple mechanics, but requires much forethought, some luck, and an aggressive cutthroat demeanor. Oh yes, I like it! Many ways to score, so you are never without a chance to win. Indeed, cannons really do seem to be the way to go, but then again, if everyone does...there ought to be available options elsewhere. A fine game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting game which combines a number of mechanisms in an interesting way.  The bid to control the winds might seem thematically odd but it adds a great deal of tension to the game.  The expenditure of action points after the results of the auction and the movement phase are completed is well handled and I always seemed to need a few more points to accomplish my plans.  All in all, a decent game but lacks that spark to bring it to the next level.

This seems like an attempt to improve on Pirate's Cove. For the most part I would say it's successful, yet still not all that great a game. Perhaps it's because I played this game now, in 2012, not back in 2007 when it was released. It's not a design that has aged very well.

I find the blind bidding, especially late game, becomes predictable and almost a joke. The best move in the game is to move then gust of wind, allowing you to usually move and score twice in a round. This coupled with scoring influence in the zones of play and trasure maps makes WoP shallow and generally un-fun. The only redeeming quality is it is easy to learn and it is short.

I thoroughly disagree with anyone who says their decisions are not meaningful.  In our game, it was a fight to the end and the "Most" cards turned over three times in the last turn.

Someone walked up while we were playing today (13th game by the way) and they said, "Oh man, that game is just gorgeous!"   By the way, I finally won a game.  :-)

WoP is a take-that Euro which I put into the category of: I would have really liked this in High School.  That comment isn't meant to disparage the game as the fact is that my tastes have changed over time.  I can see why others may like it: there's an arms race as you can plunder other boats if you have more weapons than your opponent.  There are multiple ways to score, a race element in that you score points for completing an area (earning reputation) on a downward scale where the first person scores the most points, etc.  There's even an auction to control the wind and turn-order.  Don't discount the importance of wind direction as it can really hurt or help you.  A majority of the cards are screwage cards which is where I don't like the game.  You build things up and then get plundered or cards thrown at you.  It's fun when you're the instigator but other than that it can be frustrating.  Read all the cards before playing so you know what to expect.  Besides the cards my biggest complaint is that you can attack players with less weapons and gain resources... nothing wrong with that except the players with less weapons are usually behind you in points.  The weak get weaker (I do know you can win with weak weapons but I imagine it would be difficult).

I truly do not see what all the fuss was about, in my gaming group and from the P-500 sages.  With all due respect to Newman and Nardo, there are better pirate games and better Euros.  And as a pirate game, it's innocuous, colorless, and pallid.  And it's competing directly with Berg's Blackbeard which I'm very sure will have some cut and thrust and blood.  Did this even need to be pirate-themed?  I'm just not sure I see the draw or why this particular game in this particular guise had to be made.

Not feelin' this one.  Didn't feel all that piratey (good call from Holmes asking where the hell Tortuga was, and no, the answer provided wasn't sufficient in my eyes), there's a heavy snowball effect with the guns taking front and center to dominating the game (making for generic take-that play, considering it's the only viable strategy in the game), and too long by about 30 minutes.  I like the Bluebeard mechanics a lot, and it's some of the best production I've seen from GMT (until Blackbeard came out).  But it's all just lipstick on a pig and I'm still looking for one good pirate game.

Three games so far, mostly tight and quite exciting. I believe the final point spreads have been only a few VP. I didn't retain all the rules so I know I missed a few opportunities but this is certainly a game to come back to. Looks like it has a number of viable strategies. There is a lot of required screwage, so don't play with any hyper-sensitive or 'revenge at any cost' players. Somewhat imbalanced and with a preference for Provisions and getting Reputation Bonuses first with Crews and Map being significantly less valuable.

Had this on preorder for a long time. The production values are some of the best I've seen from Gmt or any one else for that matter.
The game has a good bit of "take that" factors between the action cards and boarding your opponents, most appropriate for a pirate theme. Unless everyone gangs up on you - you generally won't be hurt too bad. 
Liked the mechanic of a combination of wind selection / first player bidding.
Each turn has several choices with the several ways for VPs.

This is a great pirate board game to play.  There are nine (9) turns to earn points.  You randomly start on an island location.  At the start of a turn everyone secretly votes on wind direction and then you can spend sails to ensure it is the direction you wanted.  The person who spent the most starts the turn.  You get points by visiting every island within one of four verticle groups.  You gain points by having the most of cargo, cannons and sailors at the end of the game.  During the game you can obtain treasure and get points at the end of every turn.  Whoever has the most cargo can gain one point at the end of the turn.  You can use cards to help youself or hinder your opponants.  You want treasure.

This game has grown on me since I played it last week. Haven't played it again, but have watched part of 2 other games. The balance in choosing between higher points and multiple resourse tiles also has to be balanced with how you stand against the other ships near you, as well as turn order. The wind direction mechanic and voting adds a nice touch. 

I hope that the game does really well and has the artwork updated.

* * * EDIT * * *

Ok, I've played this a couple more times, and I am starting to see that there is one clear path that can fairly easily lead to victory often. I also have to recommend that you always try to stay near the other ships, so you don't have to Gust Of Wind it more than is absolutely necessary.

The pirate theme and wind control are well executed.  The game is a little sparse with 3 players, but still enjoyable.  More players makes the wind mechanic very interesting and really brings it into play.

I want to like this game, but there just doesn't seem to be a lot of substance or replayability.

Offers a good mix of player interaction at many different levels. The feel is that of a strategic game although it is almost entirely tactical in nature. It is hard to tell who is in the lead, and final scoring seems to be tight so who picks on who (boarding, swindle, etc) is pretty much the deciding factor of the victor. Still, good length and thankfully irrelevant pirate theme so I'd be willing to play this one when requested.

Played once.  Fun time.  At least half of the game is pretty much "screw your neighbor."  There are various strategies to pursue, but unlike most other games with some "screwage" in them, you really cannot avoid utilizing it here.  Do not play with ill tempered types or you may see some "real" piracy occur.  Best pirate game that I've played.

One of the best games with blind bidding.  Wind cubes can be gained pretty easily, so it's not so bad if you take a big loss on a wind vote.  Pretty light, but some nice different strategies about what you want to go for - guns to be able to go where you want and board, goods to score extra points, treasure cards and go against the wind to get to all the right spots.

RATING: 5
Not real intrigued with this game.  Sound really cool, only not so much once you play.  Why even have wind to determine direction when you can go anywhere you want regardless of the wind?

--May2007-- Cool; they finally printed it! (But sadly, my copy arrived sufficiently late that everyone else nearby had already tried it.
--Jun2012-- Quite entertaining.  Yet I shouldn't have liked it:  it features beat-on-the-leader and blind bidding - things that generally turn me off.  Yet, strangely, (and despite the bidding for wind order thing, which is entirely thematically insane) I found myself believing this is the best Pirate themed game I've yet played.  (There's a very good chance that Eklund's _Lords of the Spanish Main_ is superior - but I've not yet got that one to the table.)  And, yeah; this could be played badly:  if we went with beat-on-the-loser instead of the other, it'd be a significantly poorer experience.
--Jan2014-- Yeah, _LotSM_ is better.  Loads better.

Disapointing.  I expected more from a GMT game.  
First.  The art, while right in line with other GMT, is really quite terrible.  The board is very nice actually, but the card art is rather dismal.
Second.  I hated that i often had to give up all my actions to go against the wind... while players that invested in weapons, could 'board' (stealing victory points and progress) from other players without even 1 action point spent.  I feel like there is a pirate game worth playing that includes mechanics similar to Winds of Plunder,  but that remains to be seen.

Not a bad game. Nothing original but the package works. This is a really MEAN game where players blind bid for wind directions and then sail to get VPs, crew and other piratey things using action points. After 9 rounds, the scores are totaled and highest wins.

There a many typical eurogame aspects (bidding, action points, action cards, crew/firepower/provisions bonuses that are taken away when another player pips you). Toss in some ameritrash plundering and luck-driven card draw and you get a package that works...only just. It feels unoriginal and bland but there is some tension at least with the auctions and trying to decide which player to attack etc. Definitely not top-shelf material.

After playing the game the first time I immediately arranged to do a second and then a third game. The graphics and the components are not really great but I liked the game very much: it conjugates simple rules and strategy complexity. As you play you realiza that several strategies can be pursued. Really like the cards that you draw that add some luck to the game (only if you wish).

I was very disappointed in this.  I really wanted to love it, and while I'm still waiting for the perfect pirate game, the more of these duds that come out, the more the market is diluted, and the less inclined people will feel to produce "The Great Pirate Game". This game is just chaos management, where people are supposed to pick on the leader to keep them in check, but those who don't have the ability to take out the big guys will stomp weaker players down the pecking order, invariably keeping them weak.

Overall, this is just bland point accumulation. 

The "battles" are calculated and there is no action in it.  The most exciting part of the game is determining the wind, but it is blind bidding where you lose your cubes if you don't win. There are too many take that cards that strip your resources away so you can never build up for a power move, so there isn't any planning only taking the best move that is available at the time, which makes the game frustrating and boring.

Almost every turn, "decisions" were made to attack the last place player, because there was nothing better to do.  This is one of my least favorite "mechanics".Were it not for the fact that I really like who I play with, I would have found this game completely miserable and exhausting.

Thar...she blows! I so wanted to like Winds of Plunder. Pirates, GMT, Eurogame. It has all the makings of great game. But what a miss. Games are supposed to be fun and engaging. Instead, this game managed to make me angry and bitter. Maybe it was the unexpected Take That element that annoyed me (but I do so like Plague and Pestilance). I got absolutely pummeled over and over and over again by the leaders of the pack. Go into port, get a good. Another ship follows, steals that good via bording while getting another good of their own via plunder. Good times, good times. But the more I think about, I really comes down to three big misses:
1) Complete lack of control in the game and thus missing any semblance of strategy
2) A terribly unengaging bidding mechanic that doesn't make sense thematically and lacks tension.
3) Down time galore!

All in all, this game reminded me of Brad Pitt in Seven Years in Tibet. Remember that fake German accent? It burns, it burns.

With the gmt name on the box, people were probably expecting a straight-up combat game instead of an abstracted strategy game. It's light and lightly themed fun with planning, prediction and yes, plundering. The gameplay is much more engaging and true to theme than Pirate's Cove but of course, the presentation is much poorer. 

MacGowan uses leftover artwork, including some from yaquinto's Swashbuckler, and slapps it down without much thought or finesse.

RATING: 9
Best pirate game I've played.  This one doesn't suffer from the too-common problem of luck dependence which plagues the pirate-genre.  Bidding for wind direction may not make sense, but who cares, the gameplay makes up for it!  The cards are wonderfully mean and piratey and VPs swing back and forth.  It's hard to get truly behind as there always seems to be a way to catch back up.  

It's a cross between ameritrash and euro, and what a great blend it is!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Meh.  The auction is sort of unimpressive.  The cards are both nasty and completely unbalanced.  With all the resources on the board turned up, there is no competition for resources.  The game is mostly about screwing your neighbor, and beyond doing that to each opponent just enough to win, there isn't a whole lot going on.  As per usual in this type of game, the guy who was behind will usually swoop in for the win.  Even as an experience game I think it fails, though not as badly as some.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting game. Every player is nearly guaranteed to score some points each turn, so you have to be selective of destinations and watch everyone's crew/cannon/provisions levels to win. There's an element of luck in the cards, and I've seen some people turned off by the card randomness, but it doesn't bother me! I enjoy this game a lot. Drawback: It seems to have a lot of rules, whihc makes them hard to explain to new players. Once play is started everyone catches on to the basics quickly, but there are still situations that require checking the rules.

[2 plays] Initial Reaction rating.  I got this game because I like the pirate theme.  I wanted a game that has a legit pirate theme to it but at the sametime is not a kids game, super luck based, and has some good strategy to it.  
After playing a few times a few things I wonder about. For one thing the voting on the wind direction just strikes me as a very odd mechanic.  The strategy is okay but really comes down to two things: voting on the wind direction, and deciding where to move to.  There are some other choices but those two seemed to be the bulk of the strategy, so I am not sure if there is the depth to hold up over multiple plays.
At the same time it was not a bad game to play.  It was fun to learn, entertaining to play and had enough strategy to keep me interested through-out.  I am interesting to play this more times and see how my opinion does or does not change.

After many games I'm at the point that I will only begrudgingly play this if someone REALLY REALLY wants to try it out.  If they've played it before and just want to...I'm going to push pretty hard to play something else. This game just simply put is not fun. The wind mechanic is the big deal of the game...and it's not fun or engaging.  

So what's the problem here? I'm thinking it's got to do with GMT using it's usual pool of play testers.  People who are typical GMT Games fans who used their ideas of what a good Euro game is and said "Yes this is a good Euro."  When they should have sought out a new pool of play testers who have had no prior affiliation with GMT and would not be afraid to say "This kinda blows."  The game very well could have been fixed. There are a lot of things that could be added/changed to turn this around...but as I've said with other games if I've got to put that much effort into a game...I'm just going to play one that is fun from the beginning.

I'm completely disheartened by having to write this as I was a P500 pre-order who waited ever so patiently (although anxiously) for this game to "save the pirate theme" and it falls so short of that mark it's not even funny.  Word to the wise...try before you buy.

BELOW IS MY INITIAL COMMENTS AFTER THE FIRST COUPLE PLAYS:
______________________________________________________________
Finally got my copy of this game and it didn't knock my socks off as I was hoping it would. GMT's attempt to create a true euro style game has seen this very American company produce an interesting hybrid.  Amero-Style? Eurican-Trash? I don't know what to call it but it is an interesting mix.  The game certainly plays via mechanics like a Euro.  No dice, movement based on position, etc.  This game however lives and breathes in the action cards and that's where the American game feel comes through as these cards can be brutal.  Given this nature I wish the deck were bigger as in a 9 round 5 player game we shuffled the deck 3 times.  We kept seeing the same cards over and over again which isn't bad really but more cards doing different things would have been nicer to see some real variation. I think the game would also benefit from a nice handful of cards that benefit the player with card but maybe doesn't beat up on another player.  End game bonus points didn't seem too thought out.  There wasn't any reason to not go strong in a on category maintain average in one and let whoever was fighting hardest in the 3rd to have it.  More clever (read interesting) bonuses could have worked and truly exist in the game as is.  Could have been better, was hoping it would have been but not too bad. I'll play it again to see what I think of it more.  Gonna reluctantly leave it at 6 and will play more to see where it goes, this game has the potential to move up or down depending on future plays.

RATING: 7
Nice and balanced, with meaningful decisions; the game length is about right for what you're doing with it. The only complaint I have is that the weapons boarding mechanic may be a little too deterministic, and a couple of the action cards may be a little too powerful.

Set in the Caribbean at a time when pirates have naught to fear but each other, Winds of Plunder allows 3-5 players to compete for Victory Points (VP) by a variety of means: plundering ports, spreading their fierce reputations in the Caribbean isles, finding buried Treasure, and boarding their opponents. Randomly placed VP tiles dictate the value of each port and the location of Treasure Maps, while a unique tile rotation system helps keep game play fresh. Weapons, Crew, and Provisions may also be found in the various ports, each of which confers its own Advantages during the game and translates to VP's in the end. Action cards enhance a player's ability to gain plunder or to forestall his opponents. Wind Cubes permit players to vie over control over the winds that guide movement and the order of play for each game round. But the clock is ticking on the days of easy piracy! The game lasts 9 rounds, or approximately 60-120 minutes.

RATING: 7
Hats off to GMT for producing a 'Euro' style game that sits comfortably with it's contempories. Components, game play, multi-faceted scoring mechanics and victory paths with a very manageable playing time - first rate family game that offers a 'real' challenge. I've played twice now and still haven't managed to grasp a winning strategy. Those treasure maps have an high cummulative return... hmmm, but they are rather 'luck' driven. What about reputation by sea area, that's a certain route to success, isn't it? Arh, but what about those advantage cards, largest crew's additional action is a must have but, then again, those weapons punch above their weight for plunder but score low at game's end... mmm, decisions, decisions. Maybe one day, given a fair wind and a little luck, I will set sail on the right course.

Played a demo in late '04 and enjoyed it. The wind cube bidding is the central cool idea in this game. Beyond that, it's sort of a race to collect the most assets. Minor concerns (this is based on only 1 play of a pre-production version, so take 'em with a grain of salt): possibly tough to come from behind, and boarding may be too deterministic... for my taste, anyway; I'd say you should be allowed to play the Weapons Cache card to ambush a stronger foe or keep from being boarded. Or maybe you should be able to bid wind cubes to add to your weapons for 1 boarding attempt.

[gameid=172] is a 7+? Suffers from War gamer bias.. Yes, more like this, GMT. Get over the box art.. there's a good game in there. Playable with two, with some slight rule changes (and play is still fast with more).. high production value too -- buy the damn thing (it's cheap).  A great family game that even mediocre gamers can enjoy.

Not a GMT war game.   It is an interesting contest of area control (regions), exploration, raiding, etc.  "Voting" which way the wind blows is interesting and "going against the wind" using a "gust of wind" is expensive (3 action points).  Played with 5, which might be one too many.

This is a fun pirate-themed game that is best with the maximum # of players (5). The "screw the other guy" factor in this game is pretty high (and this is a good thing as far as I'm concerned). Action point mechanic works well and the games are often fairly close at the end.

RATING: 4
Eh, not awful, but nothing I would ask to play again. I guess this should be compared to Pirate's Cove, and I'll say I liked this (ever so slightly) better, but I REALLY didn't like Pirate's Cove. I think these games draw a big crowd based on their theme, which is cool but theme alone doesn't draw me in personally unless there's a memorable set of mechanisms that drive the game, which in this case I didn't feel there was anything more to savor than a run-of-the-mill mid-weight Euro. I'll comment that ostensibly the game seemed to have some well thought interweaving mechanisms, but upon reflection it doesn't seem logically possible for the treasure cards (or whatever the ones are called that have locations you must visit in order to score increasing # of VPs) to be worthwhile. It seems as if their reward should start at a higher value.

I like the way this game plays out, but it is not as exciting as the theme promises. Even though the base mechanics would be applicable to other themes, this is a good fit, for an age of sale game, and does not feel pasted on. It feels a little like a cross between Pirate's Cove (crew, cannon, and goods management) and Niagara (wind direction/river speed). The one thing this game lacks is the ability to actually pirate - apparently there are only as many ships in the new world as there are players, and on retrospect that seems ... odd.

RATING: 8.4
Wow, a long wait for this one and overall I find it a solid game.  Though I'm hoping for more flavor out of the upcoming Pirates and re-release of Blackbeard.  This one has good Euro appeal to it with the wind bidding action and the "take that" boarding action isn't anything that will knock anyone out of the game.  It's also a good mechanism to keep the leader in check.  There's lots of ways to get points and your strategy can change with the wind so to speak.  Nice mounted board which is unusual for GMT products.  Including the rules and player cards in 4 lanugages was a nice touch.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting "take-that" pirate game.  Almost zero realism,  and probably would be fine with half the rounds (although at that point the randomness would probably not even out).  I always forget to raid ships for points,  which is invariably more valuable (especially in the endgame)  than other things.

This game reminds me very much of pirates cove, without any of the fun or color.  Like Pirate's Cove, there aren't a ton of meaningful decisions, but unlike Pirates Cove, this game is kind of drab and dreary to look at and play.  Quite a disappointment - I was really looking forward to this one.

RATING: 5
Might need to give this more tries. I did a 3 player once and it moved very slowly and kind of didn't feel like a game in the sense that I didn't really know what impetus there was to explore or do this or that. So I guess I'd venture to say that it struck me as pretty boring... though I really liked the concept which is why I bought it in the first place...

Chits and more chits, ARGH! There's too much luck involved for a game this long.

2016-02-11
I have two major points to criticise. First one is the quality and sheer amount of components, or to be more specific, chits. They are very thin and they come in huge quantities. This makes the game rather energy hungry to play since the chits are hard to handle and you are constantly looking for the right ones. My second point is directed at the luck-vs-length ratio. It is true that you can control the odds to a degree but if a game lasts for hours (90mins play time in my a**...) you would like to have more control over your fate. Now may feel like a feather in the wind. On the other hand you can argue that this is more thematic, since early life in Polynesia must have been merciless at the mercy of mother nature. 

I have to admit, that when I first played Conquest of paradise I was too green in the hobby. I was not ready to accept defeat because in this game it is inevitable. You are going to get smacked into face either by the game or by your opponents. And even you are not destined to lose the war, you are going to lose individual battles at least. Nevertheless, I am inclined to believe that I will not play Conquest of Paradise ever again. It requires so much time and energy and you still might not feel any sense of accomplishment that it is a safer bet just not to play.

RATING: 7.5
Nice civ light game, some strategy involved in a very nice environment. The designer really put some love into this game. The components are GMT like (no mounted board) but the colours are nice and warm. There is a bit of luck in the game (while exploring, + a push your luck mechanic, during combat) but that makes the game more approachable also by non-gamers. A bit hard to pick it up because of the structure of the rules.

RATING: 7
I really like the theme and despite this being rather abstract in many ways, the theme still shone through. I certainly prefer this to many other waros, but alas I don't think it will prove to be one of the very best ones.  

Problems are that it plays a lot slower than is stated and that it has a VERY slow start.  I think you could get over this by each player having a colonist and two sailing boats to start with.  I'm going to try that, as I just don't see the point of a boring start - ok, it may be realistic, but it's just not fun.

The combat is simple.  I don't think it would be hard for those who felt they needed something more weighty to tag that on.

There is enough to plan for, but I wouldn't describe it as deep. There is a lot of luck in it, which I don't mind at all, but some here might hate.

The box is great, the board and hexes not too bad, but I wish they'd done a bit more with the villages.  Coloured wooden huts would have been better.  And why four player colours that are so similar?

The rules are generally well written and I love the Designer's Comments booklet - excellent!  I would say that a little more clarification about sea battles would have been useful.  There are various cominations of possibility there and we had to use common sense to resolve them as the rules weren't clear.

One more thing - I like the advanced rule suggestions - they have been very well thought out and provide an interesting series of add ons to keep the game fresh.  I am sure that many players will make up their own and hopefully add them to the database here.

I was going to give this a 6.5, but the variants and the fresh them raise it to a 7.

What I liked most about the game was that you actually learned some interesting things about Polynesian cultures while playing. It was a bit slow going in the beginning, but then all four of us were learning to play the game.  

I've only played it once and I'm very tough on ratings, where I really try to follow the guidelines (I've never rated anything a 10 -- I don't think anyone can honestly say they think they'll "always" suggest a particular game to play) -- and my rating might go up with further play.  For me, a 5 or 6 is not a "bad" rating.

Ordered the new 2.0 edition of this game a week ago, just played it today on the VASSAL server, with a friend 4000 miles away. We ended the game with tied winning scores on our last turn, that's probably just a fluke. Flows pretty quickly, easy to understand the relatively short rule book. Looks great on VASSAL, looking forward to seeing the hard copy. Excellent with 2 players (Board is big enough you don't need to conflict), we'll try 3 players next week (I expect to see some combat over island chains). Lots of decisions, not so much depth that you'll suffer analysis paralysis (well, maybe in the last couple turns when you have a lot of build power, IF you are prone to AP). Theme really comes through, highly recommend this.

RATING: 6
A 4x game with a native island hopping theme.

The exploration is too random. Making the chances of winning very dependent on luck. 

Getting resources and trying to build other components was done very simply and efficiently.

Combat is very dependent on Luck. And a victory could swing the VPs significantly.

Overall, a good family game that is worth the effort to play.

RATING: 4
The theme is super; something exotic and different.  However, I found the game itself deeply disappointing.  Apart from the flavour text on the cards, what you have is a hybrid of a basic Euro production engine building game and an Axis & Allies-simple wargame.  Throw in a large dose of luck in the exploration element and add the common multi-player conflict game problem that A attacks B and so C wins.  There are a couple of things you learn in your first game, but beyond those, what are the interesting decisions?  Where is the challenge in this 90-120 minute game?

The differentiation between the player colours (greyish, bone, greenish and white coffee) is really poor. Instead of the vibrant colours one might expect of Polynesia, the whole production has oddly muted tones.

Interesting game and theme. However if you are playing with two persons, the game can turn into a very long and bitter fight. Moving second - when you are behind in VPs - gives you the opportunity to come back.

RATING: 5
An interesting theme and asymmetric player starting positions usually create a promising starting point for a great game, but unfortunately with Conquest of Paradise this promise was not completely fulfilled. The game creates a tense and competing atmosphere, but it seems that by engaging into a battle the players not involved in the battle will have the biggest benefit. At least this was the case in our 4-player game where the winner was the player who didn’t actively participate in the battles.

Initial look suggests a Civ Lite type game.

After initial play with 4 players rated at 7.Upgraded after further plays to 7.5.

 Easy to learn and we used advanced game which isn't that hard and adds a lot of additional flavour,  particuarly with 2 tile Aotorea. Combat is a risky affair and it can devolve into a 'bash the leader' when the score hits 14-16 in the four player but the VP's on culture cards add a bit of balance.

Interesting theme.Lots more about the exploring than combat, but when your population begins to outgrow their resources then short and sharp military expeditions can reap rewards.

5/20/2013: Added to GMT P500 reprint list.

Tentative rating after one play.  A light civ game.  With 4 players more direct conflict due to scarce resources (islands) than you get with 2 players.  You need to be able to adjust your strategy depending upon which islands you find.  Players finding too many good islands can find themselves set upon by others.  This felt a little dry for me.  It's a tweener game for GMT, so though the production values are standard for GMT wargames they'll get a grief from players used to games produced in higher volumes.

Played four player game, but mystifyingly two players start with a piece less.  As this has a multiplier effect throughout the game this did not seem a clever design feature.  Like most exploration games there was a lot of luck on what you discovered, which for our game certainly played a part in the outcome.

RATING: 5
This game probably deserves another play or two but my initial impression was pretty flat.  Thematically this is a very rich game.  The early conquests and exploration of Polynesia is pretty cool and there's plenty in this game to highlight it's flava.  My one problem with the components is that the player colors are way too similar to be effective.

mechanics-wise it just doesn't generate much tension.  I found the exploration aspect to be too random giving massive rewards to some while being unfairly stingy to others.  The rich in this case quickly get richer while others simply tread water with no alternate strategies for remaining competitive.

all in all, Nexus Ops does basically the same thing as Conquest of Paradise only it does it much much better.

Civ lite? Rating after one play. Combat is simple (Attack! style) but appropriate for the subject matter, "primitive" Polynesian combat. It seems the game can play fairly quickly, about 3 hours for four players. In my first game I was the only power utilizing military aggression and I failed in each of my three attacks. The other players were passive expansionists who colonized many islands. I think that had I started attacking sooner (I was the first to build war canoes) I may have had greater success. It is interesting that the game can be played and won with minimal combat. I'm still thinking about efficient methods to attack others. I look forward attempting more aggressive strategies in my second game. 
Which reminds me of comments after my first and only game of Civilization, were I felt that earlier and more aggressive play would have gained me more.
Update: Funny I wrote this since I won my third game of Civ by being very aggressive.

RATING: 8
GMT game that portrays the eastward expansion into the South Pacific islands - an interesting theme that rarely gets any treatment. This game came out quietly and has pretty much stayed below the radar - but I like it and think of it as a very decent three or four player game of exploration and empire building.

Players establish a base of operations and explore/expand into the South Pacific ocean. The basic resource generator is the village and discovered island groups can hold up to four of these. Villages generate build points which are used to purchase transport canoes, war canoes, war bands, colonists, and more villages. Cards can also be purchased that provide various bonuses and hidden VPs.

Your success at exploration will ultimately determine your success and the process is quite random. Conquest is possible but can be dangerously random as well. Fortunately, the game plays relatively quickly so the randomness isn't a deal breaker (the way it is in Settlers of Catan for example). The exploration part of the game is very well done and thematic, as is the movement and combat scheme, with the caveat regarding the essential randomness of it all.

Think "Warriors of God" but shorter and on water...


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A game of exploration, conquest and civilization building that falls short of its potential.  The exploration while fun can be wildly random and unforgiving.  Game components aren't well thought out (universal village counters).  The idea of turning the island tiles to show ownership is retarded and makes for a mess.  The inclusion of simple wooden cubes or individual village tokens would have been the right way to go.  The combat resolution system feels crude and is a big letdown.  It's not a bad game, but it just could have been so much better.

Juego de exploración y conquista. Está ambientado en la polinesia del pacífico y cada jugador lleva una tribu que tiene que expandirse y explorar nuevas islas, colonizarlas y ocasionalmente, invadir y pelear con los vecinos.

Hay algo de azar y eso puede hacer que alguien se quede fuera del juego. El juego premia al que va el primero. Cuanto mejor te va, más probable es que te vaya bien.

Es entretenido y no muy complicado, aunque el poder quedarte fuera de la partida independientemente de lo bien que hayas jugado no es algo que me atraiga.

RATING: 9
UPDATE: OK, well, I think this game is fun, and I'm sticking with my rating. But for the record: it is a pretty pure empire-building game where the one with the best economy wins, and a lot of that boils down to finding good islands. The game does give you the tools to mix it up, but at the end of the day, this is the same game we've seen a million times where the underlying structure simply isn't that interesting. For me, CoP is saved by the short playing time and by a decent combat system. Also along those lines, it is a it's certainly possible for games to be really messed up by weird, edge-case luck. Last game I played, one player literally discovered nothing but uninhabitable atolls, which just made the game weird, and not a lot of fun for him. Most games will be more reasonable, I think, but the potential for arbitrary weirdness messing the game up is definitely there, and if one area creaks (strange island distribution) it further magnifies the impact of luck in others (the card draws). It's not a particularly tight game, but it's not too complicated, interesting, fun, and thematic, and at 90 minutes or so, I can't complain about the failings too much. It won't be for everyone, but I like it. In this genre of games (TI3, Struggle of Nations, Nexus Ops, Antike, and so on), it's one of the few I'll play. I like the two Star Wars Risk games better, but they are somewhat different animals.
---
Having expressed healthy skepticism in my comment below, I have to say that playing this game was a very pleasant surprise. I think it's actually found a very nice spot - not too long (crucially - figure 2 hours or so your first time out, if someone is familiar with the rules), mostly building, exploring, and developing, but with a bit of combat, and nicely evocative of the Polynesian theme - the exploration of the unknown, of isolated colonies and long distances. I also like that while combat tends to be decisive, it's also not actually that bloody in terms of casualties. So players who fight are not necessarily just weakening themselves for the others.

Not everything is quite right here, I think ... the cards, which in general are nicely done in that they give the players some goals and impetus to action, can also be a little strange as one player lays down four or five of them at once to try to claim the win. And they don't seem totally balanced, getting the nice ones that give 2 or even 3 VP is quite a coup. And the generic villages combined with island rotation to show control is lame, a few villages in player colors would have helped alot.

But for me, enough is right here for it to be good fun. The game grows and develops in interesting and clever ways, and the system is pretty clean. I got this at the end-of-year 50% off sale for P500 customers, and was not expecting a lot. But I hope to play and enjoy this a number of times yet.

All in all, while this is certainly not a *great* game, it's my most pleasant surprise of 2008 so far.

This is a wonderful topic for a game, but I worry that instead of getting a real Polynesian-themed game we're just going to get another lightly-themed, by-the-number civilization building and conquest game that could have taken place in outer space or anywhere else, for that matter (make your money, invest it in either colonies or armies, beat your neighbors over the head, and buy "civilization" cards with thematic names). I wish GMT would have better P500 descriptions. The current listing tells me almost zilch about gameplay, and leads me to suspect that it's just another in a long line of these things that is basically not going to work. But I'll still play it when it comes out to see for sure, because I love the concept.

It is truly a 4x in board-game form, one that is not bloated with information or stuff. Turns go fast and downtime is minimal, game can easily be over in less than 2 hours.

It doesn't have the "competitive 4x" vibe other titles may inspire, rules feel a bit lose on the specifics and a lot is left to random chance. The Arts & Culture are a cool way to add technology to the game but they seem random and chaotic, there should be a better mechanic for developing technology.

love the theme. think civ with a mai tai. like the hidden information - nice compromise between block game secrecy and trad open board. island group ownership mechanic (rotating tiles) is klunky; would have preferred color-coded villages to denote ownership. 4 player colors are too similar and make it difficult to distinguish them. play is quick. combat is a little simple for my taste. 1 play only.

RATING: 3.3
2 plays - 4 player

A good exploration game with a hint of civilization building that's hamstrung by wargaming style components and rules.  

I love this game's theme (it was the first game I ever preordered to support its release) but it is *very* difficult to teach new players.  The rules seem unnecessarily convoluted, are not very intuitive, and have many "loopholes" for lack of a better term.  

I am reminded of classic Avalon Hill titles like Advanced Civ and Kremlin - where it seems that half of your first game is spent "looking things up" and the rules are an obstacle to enjoyable play.

The game is a pleasant experience, but I worry that the game play / enjoyment / challenge is not commensurate with the game's duration and rule set.  I find CoP falling down the list of games I'd play if I had 2 hours to spend with 3-4 good gamers.

There is a high dose of luck in drawing good island groups, failure to do so can doom a player, particularly a newcomer to the game.  I have no desire to play a 2-3 hour long game where a player can be doomed to watch while others, who actually have a chance of winning, play the game.

When you explore, you draw a chit that may be an island group, or open sea.  If it's an island group, it may be a large one, a small one, or and uninhabitable atoll.  The battle resolution mechanism is a neat idea, but it is based on rolling a six sided die again and again.  Only production is unsullied by the hand of chance as each village makes a production unit.  But this gives the game a simplistic, linear growth curve, as your people plod along doing steadily more and more things every turn.

The choice of player counter colors ... wow - this could not have been intentional.  There is white and three, slightly off-white colors: putty, sand, and khaki.  Pieces will get mixed up.

CoP is an acceptable 2-3 hour long game, but it's getting lost in the sea full of such titles.  I love the theme, but hate the randomness.  I never want to teach this game again.  The rules are a bit overwrought, there's a large dose of chance, and the potential to be out of the running from early in the game exists - all features which worry me.  All that having been said, I would give the game one more try but I probably won't suggest it.

UPDATE 3/15: Played again, finally, this time with three players instead of two.

The good news is that Conquest of Paradise is greater than the sum of its parts. The bad news is that the parts in question are a kind of half-assed 4X (Xplore, Xpand, Xploit, Xterminate) game and a kind of half-assed civ game. Power tends to snowball because your capacity to build a decent strike force is a function of the number of villages you own, which itself is to an unfortunate extent of how much you strike lucky with your explorer chit, so a player who has taken it on the chin in that area faces an uphill climb in an effort to redress the balance by invading other players and taking [i]their[/i] stuff. If rapid expansion was a bit more of a drag on the resources of the people who hit Hawaii or New Zealand vs. the poor sap who draws open water and useless atolls, you might feel a bit more of a sense of the old Multiple Paths To Victory everyone talks about when we talk about many of the great ones. It might have also gone a ways towards redressing the other major problem, endemic to so many 3-player conflict games: relatively desperate player A, seeing no path to victory from peaceful development/turtling, lunges after player B in search of a little sun-dappled lebensraum, with the end result, successful or otherwise, amounting to throwing the game to player C.

And I still have to give a big thumbs-down to the physical components: the cardstock map (absent a decent plexi of the sort that I just simply am not lugging to game night at the local cafe) is annoying to deal with and the bizarre choice of a white/off-white/pale yellow/pale green palette for the four players' bits contributes little to the theme and much to the frustration of everyone playing in a less-than-ideally lit area. (Feel free to ignore this paragraph if you're on the fence about backing the P500; one suspects that people more eloquent, or at least less prolix, than I have already made their feelings on the matter clear.) 

Having taken my whacks:

The best aspect of Conquest of Paradise is the fact that it makes a functional, fun game out of what is fundamentally an extremely slender rule set, in a genre (4x) that is practically synonymous with bloat. I can easily see 90 minute games being realistic without my unsteady hand at rules explanation getting in the way. The modular make-it-as-you-explore map does convey the feeling of expansion into an unknown new world and the push-your-luck minigame of exploration is fun and interesting while remaining easy to internalize. And the designer deserves a big hat tip for the simple act of setting his game in a milieu that is both interesting and highly unfamiliar to the average gamer -- most pop-culture artifacts set in the Pacific Islands reek of either patronizing cartoonish exoticism or only-mildly-less-patronizing Noble Savage bullhockey, and Conquest of Paradise makes the all-too-rare effort to portray its protagonists as actual human beings with a 3D culture, and has some first-rate historical notes that are a window into a world almost no one likely to buy this game has non-trivial knowledge about.

Plus, and this will certainly serve as a bottom line, everyone involved came away saying they had a good time and would happily play again.

ORIGINAL COMMENT:

Can't really decide if it's going for "4X game stripped to the bare essentials" or "Euroish exploration/building game with the nice bonus of being able to send obsidian-club-wielding maniacs to mess with your opponents' worlds." Ungainly but not unfun, the rules are straightforward, and it moves at a brisk clip. My copy is the first edition, with a chintzy cardboard map that refuses to lie straight (if a truly mounted map is not an option, ferchrissake just use paper) and a truly regrettable color scheme using a vanishingly small tangent of the color wheel; these grate but should not be drawbacks of the upcoming second edition, whenever that comes out.

One play is too soon to tell but I don't smell a classic.

RATING: 3
I try to keep an open mind about games outside of my favorite genres. I can usually appreciate a good game when I come across one. I'm not sure what to do abut Conquest of Paradise, whose design fails on every conceivable level yet has generated enough buzz to be hard to dismiss out of hand.

When learning of the manner by which turn order is determined, most of us will have a reaction of the "WTF?" variety. The player with the fewest points, ties broken in a hard-coded order, selects who goes first and whether play will proceed in a clockwise or counter-clockwise fashion. Because clearly in a four-player game, it would be far too unbalancing to simply allow one player to dictate turn order.

Before you wipe that incredulous look off your face, you'd better learn about the economic system players must exploit to amass points. Thematically speaking, everyone is paddling surveyors around the map, discovering islands, and then paddling colonists out to those islands to build towns. Those towns and the islands they're on will be the players' primary point sources. In game terms (and simplified--though not much!), each turn, each player will randomly unearth between 0 and 3 point sources worth between .5 and 4 points each. Over several turns, they will proceed to invest 3-10 units of production power to extract those points, along with a moderate increase in production capacity. The effect is comic, a linearly increasing number of bicycles all running in a very low gear, or a growing line of hamsters spinning their own tiny wheels. The method by which the board is developed has a similar effect. Hands and counters move all over the place in what is literally at least a five-step process that consumes zero brain power, and when it's all done, there is a new point source on the board.

You spend your extra production capacity on cards which award 0-3 points apiece. This is a game where the winning score is in the 20s.

After awhile, whoever drew the most efficient point sources and didn't get too distracted fighting other people wins.

Will take a few plays to completely sink in.  Looks to be a solid game and my rating will probably go up.  Need to wrap my head around transport canoes used for transit and used for control; but I think we played it right.

Production slightly under par for GMT.  Discovery chits needed to be a different blue so they stand out (I think the designer said they should have been the color of the game board).  Also, my ocean hexes weren't completely glued (front and back) and one has already fallen apart.

Played it twice, didn´t manage to finish either session.

Beautiful production and well-designed game. The theme and the art choices are a great match. The sweet potatoes add so much to it, in my opinion. I love that little detail.

Ultimately, its another explore and fight game, just with a cool setting that distinguishes it from other games of that category.  I'm not sure the game is otherwise terribly memorable, even though there are some unique aspects to the combat. I enjoyed playing, although you CAN get screwed by the island placement. Its just maybe a little too long for a game that has that much chaos possible in the access to scoring areas.

I'd play again if someone else was interested, but I probably won't push too hard to get it on the table.

Hey GMT why they hell couldn't you guys throw in a mounted board with this game like you did with Winds of Plunder? I can live with the shitty components when playing a wargame with a ton of chits, but this game ought to have had a better component treatment. 

The game is pretty good and I look forward to trying again, but it loses points off my rating for the lousy map and counters.

Dec. 7, 2008 -- Basically a GMT Euro game that punishes (more than encourages) conflict between the players. Starting slow, the victory point accumulation ramps up quickly, which makes it deceptively slow at first. There are some good mechanics in the game that I like, but I think more stress on conflict would make this game more interesting and fun. 5/10

I really like this game, but unfortunately some in the gaming  group feel its unbalanced.

Lets get this produced already. It looks exactly like the type of game I will love, and my friends and gamers might enjoy. Arrived and ready to play.

First play see session report. Some major balance and play issues, the tension is not equal to some great CDGs or euros, but its a good game, and worthy of a coupel more plays to improve the rating.  
3 plays and its a good game not great. Soemthing I really enjoy and really feels different from anything else in rotation currently.  The design is very good and the mechanics fit the them, However, this doesn't necessarily lead to amazingly painful decisions, in fact they can be kind of predictable.  Despite a new map each game the fixed starting locations make the games start to feel too similar.  The way to shake it up is warfare but that may turn others off to the game.  It will be hard to find a niche, but it is a good, distinctive game.

Good game on Polynesian empire-building, but not on an epic scale. Good simulation yet not too convoluted with rules overload as many GMT games seem to have. There is some luck in the island groups you can discover, but if that happens, then you just go and invade your neighbors' islands instead. Can be fiddly, but not as much as a typical hex-and-counter wargame. 

The designer is very active on the forums and helpful in answering rules questions. Bonus.

Update: After a couple plays, results are mixed. The exploration is a bit clunky in practice but nothing too terrible. Both exploration and combat are a crapshoot. The former can be very swingy in terms of your empire's overall strength (though the culture cards help here) and the latter encourages heavy turtling. The player colors are atrocious. I think it may need a bit more spice, so I think I'll try adding the advanced rules next time and/or the random events from C3I.

The rulebook is definitely frustrating. That euro style rulebook makes things hard to reference, and some things are just not explained, like mythical islands and the 1+ on the explorer token. The FAQ is rather big. Hopefully these issues are addressed in the 2nd edition.
--
I haven't played yet, but an initial reading of the rules suggests this is a actually a wargame dressed up as a eurogame. Unfortunately, I suspect this means it will appeal to neither crowd. We shall see.

The rulebook itself leaves a lot to be desired. The points are all covered, but basic gameplay is somehow difficult to decipher. I had to infer some things and read an FAQ nearly as long as the rulebook itself. It's never a good sign when a significant chunk of the posts on the forum are rules question. But, we'll see if I can muddle through.

This game continually surprises me. Each time I play, it seems to improve.

The subject matter is fascinating, and the implementation is pretty good - combat feels mostly hesitant and full of people shouting at each other, with little actual bloodshed, as it should. The research and background information is great, and the production is lovely - even if the player pieces are a little too close to each other's hue. The exploration and "Turning Inward" rules are great.

The culture cards are a little disappointing, in that there is little decision making surrounding them, but they get the job done with "technology trees" or similar overhead, and they are something you'll want to invest in mostly after your micro-empires are established, and you've spread over the map.

Only one three player game so far.

The game was fun and quite different from many other games which is a good thing here. The main negative part is that the third player is a bit too far away from the other two at start and never really got into contact until the end. This depends on the map of course but I think it will be much better with four players.

What drags the rating down is really the production value of the game. The box is cool but that's about it. Why GMT didn't include villages in the different player colours is a mystery to me. Wooden cubes would be even better. And why that choice of player colours?

Update: Sold it.

Player represent a tribe of Polynesians, expanding and colonizing the Pacific Islands.  Players take turns working through the phases of a turn - move, fight, build.  Movement can be along "supply lines" of navigable routes, then into the unknown.  Fights are simply line them up, and roll D6's to get individual results.  Builds can be new colonies, troops, villages or ships.  Simple, workman-like stuff - works well and scratches a nice 2 hour "build a civ." itch.  Can get a bit fiddly with the face down "trust me" build rules, and the tons of counters on the board.  May be rather luck based too - you need to expand/colonize to boost your builds to buy troops, but if you get unlucky with exploration, the game may just run away from you.  Advanced rules include the south island of New Zealand, and the sweet potato!

A good if sometimes a bit boring light exploration/civilization building game. Has quite lot of luck, but luck actually works in this context.

Out of the box -version seems to have runaway leader problem, but the optional event cards ease that problem.

RATING: 5
The theme is highly interesting, the game material is nice and GMT has invented a new kind of sturdy box that is truly great. It is just that this game lacks anything "special" (apart of it's short playing time). The mechanics are very old-fashioned and it has the usual problems of many empire building games, most notably that introducing luck in exploration makes some players automatically stronger than others and that attacking a 2nd player will benefit a third player, not yourself.
Still this could be a good "introductory" civ lite game for new players, as the rules (excpet the fiddly FOW rules) are very straightforward and easy, and the game plays along at a good pace. But they will move on to meatier stuff soon.

This game is loads of fun! It hits the right spot with its light rules, relatively short playing time and good tension with the push-your-luck exploration and a varying gameboard. I won't play it two-player (better games out there for that) but for a light, multiplayer, exploration and conquest-type game, this is head and shoulders above FFG crap like Twilight Imperium and Ad Astra. 

The hidden VP cards reminds me of Settlers of Catan. Really adds the tension and forces players to think about who's really winning and stopping him!

And you really learn something about history and culture playing CoP. Kudos to GMT for including the designer notes.

I've always liked 4X games (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate) on the computer, and this is the same type of game, with the extra bonus of having a nicely done historical theme.  Even more importantly, unlike most 4X games, this one plays in a relatively short time.  Our first two player game only took about two hours, our second took considerably less than that.

I've also now played it with four players, and it did not take significantly longer to play, taking a little over two hours, including time spent teaching the game to three new players. I'm still liking this one quite a bit.

Played a demo copy at a convention, and this one is outstanding.  It's got exploration, civ-building, and limited to all-out warfare all in the same package-- and it works.

Do you purchase a technology advancement, a settler, or a war canoe?  Very entertaining and replayable.

Solid game so far.  With different production values and a sci-fi retheme (though I like the Polynesian theme, it fits very well, just talking about sales) it would have been a good seller.  Ah well.  The Settlers style card special abilities are very cool and can help differentiate player civs.  It's also a pretty simple game, overall.

The main issue I have with the game is the buildup is just a tad too slow.  The last few turns are a ton of fun when you have lots of options and build points, but you spend a lot of turns with very limited build points that it drags out the game a bit.

A good first play. I think there is much to explore in this game in terms of alternate strategies. The game mechanics are sound, it is mostly a question of whether it will make for compelling gameplay in future plays. I like the explore mechanic and the combat is interesting enough. There is A LOT of hidden information in this game, if you do not like hidden information I would not recommend this one.

Yup, after the second play the game was really close pretty much all the way through. I enjoy this one as a light wargame/hybrid.

Fantastic game of exploration, development, and conflict in the Pacific.  Personally, I find that the game can be won too quickly without conflict taking place, so I like to add 5 VP to the end game totals.

Acquired May 08 (Math Trade) - First play (2 players).  I don't think 2 players is the ideal number.  There was too much 'space' to expand into and too little conflict.  I look forward to playing it with 3 or 4 next time.

Overall, this would be a good grab if you wanted a 4X game in your collection. It's not anything ground breaking but it is easy to teach and plays smoothly.

PROS
-Everything from building up your forces, taking actions, and scoring points makes this a pretty easy to grok 4X game. The only exception to this might be rules for transit and movement which, with some more plays, would probably be a non-issue.
-Combat is resolved very, very simply. 
-Ramps up considerably.

CONS
-Like a lot of 4X games, we were over an hour into the game before there was any direct conflict. This means there are several turns where you're simply building up and building up.
-The luck of the draw with the A&C cards is kinda lame. House rule it to draw two, choose one?
-I also didn't care for how the A&C cards' powers lasted for the whole game once revealed.
-For such a huge board, there is a lot of dead space. Combine this with the fact that it's often hard to find room for all your chits and houses and it's kind of obnoxious.
-25-point game end condition feels to me like the game overstays its welcome a bit. Shorten to 20-22?

A really good theme, but have too much of elements, which I dislike. Too war-like and random from both exploration markers, island tiles, drawn cards and dice throws (without any modifications) in battles. There are too many random elements at the same to be interesting and none may be countered in any way, except that a few cards without VP may help you a little bit). The warriors and other tokens are also hidden until used.
I also dislike that the designer promotes his game by giving the game a 10 instead of being neutral. I should have given it a 1 just due to this fact, as somebody else has done. But still it's actually better than Monopoly.... :-) ...although not much!

Reacquired new Deluxe edition. Played solo variant. Very good. The mounted map and new colors make a beautiful game.

Played two 4 player games in the last week. Everyone really enjoyed it. Great combination of exploration and conflict. Every game is different.

One criticism is the starting positions of Raiatea and Hiva in a 4 player game.  Raiatea is caught between the other three tribes and in both our games came in last place. They are able to expand but are easily ganged up on from 3 sides. Hiva is isolated from the rest of the map and can easily progress toward victory unhindered. Raiatea is the only tribe within reach to keep them in check, but is too worried about turning their back on the other 2 tribes. It would have been better to position them in the same manner as Tonga and Samoa to keep any one tribe from having an advantage or disadvantage in  a 4 player game. This is the only thing that keeps me from giving the game an 8.

I like this game.  Exploration, expansion, combat always seem to work for me.  Every turn you're looking to see what's beyond the horizon.  Rules are pretty simple to grasp so you can be up and playing in no time.  The one down side is the map.  If you don't have Plexiglas to fore it flat, you're in for some frustrating play

RATING: 7
(06/2012) This is a light-to-middle weight exploration/civ-lite game, with simple, straightforward game mechanics and engaging play. It is a VP race, similar to Antike, where the end-game VP threshold is dependent on number of players.

Most notable is the exploration mechanism, which brilliantly blends uncertainty with a "push your luck" aspect. You can explore as many hexes as you wish, only constrained by the number of "knots" you encounter as you enter a new ocean hex. Whether it is an island or empty ocean, there is tension and excitement as players explore the unknown. Exceed five knots and your explorer ship is "lost" for a turn, meaning no exploration phase for you next turn. The exact composition of a "discovered" island is only known to the explorer, until they settle it with colonists. However, other players can explore that same hex and attain the same information. It is somewhat similar to [i][thing=1334]Entdecker: Exploring New Horizons[/thing][/i], where exploration can start wherever a player can "trace" a continuous path, through a contiguous network of ships, from existing settlements to the "edge" of the unknown. However, like most exploration mechanisms, the disposition of each player's empire will mostly be dependent on chit-draw (to "discover" islands) and hex-draw (to determine the relative value of an island, in terms of possible village expansion spaces), thus there may be complaints of randomness.

The economic engine is straightforward too. Similar to [i][thing=6472]A Game of Thrones[/thing][/i] each village contributes one "build point" towards production, and there is a shopping list of items, all which help in growing your polynesian empire: more villages, ships, warriors, colonists, "art and culture" cards, etc.

The "art and culture" cards represent a collection of highly abstracted primitive "technology" advances, which are a mixture of combat modifiers and/or VP. They are similar to development cards [i][thing=13]The Settlers of Catan[/thing][/i], although you can only buy one per turn. It is possible that the "sleeper" last-place player can surge ahead in VP by turning in a bunch of these cards and win the game, which is what happened in my first game.

Combat is unpredictable, zero-sum game, similar to Risk, although the odds are 50/50 with a 1D6: 1) attacker destroyed, 2-3) attacker retreats, 4-5) defender retreats, 6) defender destroyed. However, the art and culture cards can steer the odds in favor of the card holder. Combat continues until one side loses all of their units. Because raising combat "warrior" units and "war canoes" to carry them is very expensive, attacking is probably not a good idea early in the game.

The map is an representation of the South Pacific, with asymmetric starting locations for each player. Since exploration is random, each player will end up with a unique collection of islands and atolls, each with geographically diverse locations. Thus, each game will be unique, posing different tactical and strategic challenges for each player.

I suspect that the "feel" of the game will vary, depending on the number of players. 2-player may be mostly focused on exploration, while 4-player is quite cramped, thus leading to early conflict. Our 3-player game was relatively relaxed, since we lucked out on island draws (the chit draw could have put out less islands). We were all preparing for conflict, when the game ended with two players reaching the VP threshold for 3-players. The 3-player game could have gone the other way, had there been less islands.

All-in-all, it is relatively quick-playing, although our first play clocked in at about 2 hours. While the exploration system is very engaging, we all felt there was not enough tension for 3-player, since there was no combat, but this is probably due to groupthink. It may play differently with four, as explained above. This game may take several more plays to warm-up to, to fully appreciate the design. While comparisons to other exploration/civ games are inevitable, it is not a bad little game. It scratches the itch for exploration, but seems a touch thin on theme--two of us were thinking this exploration system could easily be re-themed for space/sci-fi (and that would be awesome).

Bits and production quality are standard GMT. The cardboard map was annoying, due to warping. Unit colors were a confusing narrow range of pastel colors--again, typical GMT. Everything else is minimalist and functional. Initial rating is a lukewarm '7'.

This game is good! It has a good pace. You have to think both defensively and offensively at the same time because the islands are often close together and denfense does not overwhelm offense in this game.

The designers notes are very good, and worth the time to read.

Tried with 2 and 3 players. Conquest of Paradise is pitched as a 'family game' by GMT, so how does it rate as such? Well, it suffers from fairly typical GMT production values. These are okay for a wargame, but result in a product that is significantly below the level of quality of an average Eurogame. The game rules are fairly straightforward, yet the rulebook is not up to Eurogame standards. The game itself is an unusual hybrid. The theme is so well-developed that it is clear that the designer started with that and then worked out the mechanics of the game. Based on the core mechanics alone, Conquest of Paradise could almost be a Eurogame. Almost, but not quite, as the combat is pure Ameritrash. The cards are very thematic but seem more like an add-on than an integrated part of the game. However, it is the bash-the-leader possibilities and length of the game that take CoQ firmly out of family game territory. From a wargaming perspective I enjoy the theme but find too high an element of chance in the drawing of tokens and tiles - it seems that the end result depends as much on luck (especially tile draws early in the game) as on strategic and tactical decision-making. In the end, Conquest of Paradise is closest to a Martin Wallace game. But if were his, it would be one of his middle-ranking efforts.

Finally got to play a partial game of the release version, almost three years after first playing the prototype.  The rules are relatively easy to understand, and the exploration component is a thrill.  I'd love some technology to make this a true 4X game, but it is what it is and what it is is pretty good.  Luck of the exploration tiles can play a significant factor, but as long as the island distribution is only mildly unbalanced there's a lot of room for skillful play to mitigate.  I'd like to play a full game soon; had to be aborted after two hours just as things were getting interesting.

Conquest of Paradise is not at all what you expect from GMT. It is more euro-game than war game. The same game - with minor tweaks - could easily have been published with wooden pieces instead of counters and with a quality board. However, having a euro-game produced like a war game will win over neither group. This makes a marketing challenge that is difficult to overcome.

How is the game in spite of this? It is essentially a game of exploration and light warfare. For what it is, especially with all of the Polynesian history thrown in, it isn't bad. However, the exploration aspect is limited in a number of ways. Island configurations are the only thing that really adjusts from game to game and those discoveries are not interesting or varied enough to hold up game after game. The warfare is too simplified to be of much interest to those who like war games. Essentially this game falls into the weaker niches of the exploration and war game genres. I can see some folks enjoying a few plays of this, but lasting value is hard to decipher.

So, in short, the audience for this game is a person who loves waros (war/euro game cross-breeds), is not at all bothered by war game component quality (paper board, chits), and finds sufficient variety from game to game solely through different geographical arrangements rather than through multiple strategic options. If all of that sounds like you, then you'll probably dig this one. For a few games, at any rate.

Played solo and with Euro-playing (non-wargamer) friends.  Really enjoyed it; faster than it looks and plenty of decisions to make: what to build, if/where to explore, which direction to move in, where to reinforce, where to attack, etc. A couple of comments: First, the use of hidden pieces. As the game gets going it becomes very difficult to remember what pieces are what, and players will constantly be picking them up to see what's in a stack: time consuming and fiddly as hexes become crowded. Secondly, there is more rules verbiage for players to remember than in a Euro like Caylus or Puerto Rico. The production values are great; the art is beautiful and the components are solid, especially the cards. Its wargame heritage is evident in the chits, where a good Euro would have provided wooden pieces for villages, canoes, warriors, etc., and unmounted board (that supplied is nice and thick but still needs to be covered to stay flat). The colours of the players pieces should be more strongly differentiated, and I wish the Open Ocean chits were a darker blue (the colour makes it difficult to tell a known Open Ocean hex from an Unknown hex). The rules are not a model of clarity and need a comprehensive FAQ and a rewrite in Living Rules format.

The theme carries this game which is not very original in mechanics. You really get the feeling that you're discovering islands in the Pacific Ocean and slowly build up your empire. You decide if you want to go the conflict way or develop your nation peacefully. Notwithstanding your decision, it can happen that there's no way for you to win if you only discover open water and worthless islands close to your home island group, roll dice badly in conflict or if others decide to pick on you jointly. No mechanism is provided to counter any kingmaking in multiplayer games. If you accept beforehand that not every player will have a shot at winning and the winner most likely will be decided by kingmaking, you can enjoy three hours+ of Moai building, war canoes fighting each other, suffering from malaria and setting out to discover sweet potatoes. 
The claimed 90 minutes playtime assume a quick and experienced group. A potential drawback is the secret building phase. So only play it with people whom you trust. And make sure to have some plexiglass available to lay over the map which is close to being unusable otherwise.

Rule mistakes in first game:
- Put villages in independent isles on attack
- 1 or 2 villages give 1 local warrior, 3 or 4 give 2
- Explore is possible across discovered hexes or twice in the same hex
- Transport canoes can move even after participating in a transport chain

Way too much luck! In our three player game I explored succesfully 4 times, on which I draw 2 islands and 2 atolls. So I draw empty chit about 15 times, most of them close to my starting island. Because of that others get to cultivate and build their islands, gathered more building points and accessed action cards earlier before me. So when I get to start battling against leader, he already had a good hand of cards for defence and could easily build armies and attack my poor civilisation.

[b]12/16/2007 : [/b]I just played for the first time today, not bad! For a light and fast civilization building game it's pretty fun. We've only scraped the surface of what's possible since we only had one combat at the end of the game (in a 3 player game) and the Art cards were hardly used. I can see where some variations could be applied that might improve the game (for my group, and mostly only dealing with combat), but I'll give it a few more tries first as is before giving those another thought. I love the fact it comes with a 20 page book containing the designer's notes. After giving those a read, it'll make the game that much more interesting and you can relay the info to the other players as you play.

The only ding out the door I have for it is that despite the fact Kevin invested so much time in the theme and cultural aspect of the game, it doesn't really show unless you read the background and get into the Art cards as there's very little other forms of chrome in order to keep the game fast and smooth. I kinda wish the Art cards were more forced on the players in some way to bring them to light because they add to the theme (something I might look into doing somehow later). However, one could also simply use a little imagination and bring their own chrome to the game.

In short: If you're looking for a light civilization building game with random exploration board building that you can teach in around 10 minutes and lasts less than two hours, and you have a hankering for all things Polynesian, you can't go wrong with Conquest of Paradise.

I played this once with a group of four whilst Mr Kevin McPartland (designer) taught the system. Of course, the nice thing about this game is that you really dont need Kevin to teach. The system was very intuitive. We did not engage in combat, and only a few of the cards were purchased. I felt the VP level for 4 players was too short. But then, one could easily expand this. The 22 VP game lasted around 90 minutes. If you want a game with more conflict and card purchase, etc, I would think that it would be east to ratch it up to say, 30 VPs...requiring conquest or more card purchase. I would play this again...and have actually purchased it through the P500 system.

I'm surprised this game is not more highly rated. It is a good game, it is fun to play and even includes a booklet of historical background. My only complaint would be the wargame components. This game has been done a major disservice by having the map printed on plain cardboard and using thin cardboard chits instead of a mounted map with wooden components. In spite of that I would wholeheartedly recommend the game.

RATING: 7
A fun game if you don't mind randomness playing a big part in a game.  Combat is essentially a 50/50 proposition (per roll) where larger numbers are no guarantee of victory.  (Statistically, larger numbers should win out, but we all know how that can go...)  Play with friends you trust because there are many opportunities to cheat (or make "mistakes") in the game (hidden movement, hidden builds).  This is not a bad thing, per se, but someone who likes to take advantage of this kind of opportunity could have a field day with this game.

Not a great game, but a interesting activity if you have interest in the Pacific islands. We've been reading Kon-Tiki, an account of some Norwegians crossing the Pacific from Peru to Polynesia in 1947. It's making me want to play it again.

I really need to play this with 4. Only played with 3. Something seems to be missing with 3 but can't put my finger on it.
I think it was that in the second game, we were all a little to scared to attack someone, knowing that it would weaken you so the third player could swoop in and maul what was left.

One play only. I wanted to love this, the theme and look are both great, but was very disappoint in the end. 
It felt like a slow and repetitive VP build up with only luck differentiating the players. 

In my play we had very little conflict as there doesn't seem to be much incentive. I wouldn't mind trying again and seeing if a conflict heavy game is more interesting. It's hard to believe that it would be a lot better though.

Interesting and original setting. Success is very luck dependant and combat feels largely pasted on.

Initial rating after 1 play, 3p. It's pleasant enough.  The rules make things a bit fiddly, almost like it needs some additional streamlining. The game works, just that there are a number of little rules for managing the movement and placement of counters that feels like a first draft. Worth playing a few more times, but likely best with 4 players.

Nov 2017 - clipped counters w/ 2mm corner rounder. Improves look and feel by a lot!

After one play, it is pretty interesting. Sort of scratches that "explore & build" itch but at a basic level. Combat is a little simplistic But seems to fit the game...meaning, I am not a fan but it seems to work. I would definitely play it again. The game is as conflict driven as you want it to be...but without it, it is a race to develop islands for points.

SIDE NOTE:
I updated player assets with cubes to use as villages, a "must-have" if you want to make any sense of the board.

This game did not fail to disappoint.  Nice exploration mechanism, with a variety of options for play available.  You could go aggressive, focus on cards, on expansion, taking on neutrals or other players.  Civ cards useful, not too strong.  Great variety of conditions and some good randomness.  A couple colors a bit tough to distinguish.  Quite tight with four players.  Very nice production, and one of the most solid game boxes ever.  Hidden information, quick play time.  This was well worth the 2.5 year wait.

1/18:  Long time since my last play.  Did solo with two cultures.  This game as fun as I remembered!  Simple, deadly combat, plays fast, very different maps each game.

RATING: 6.5
Exploration game where players start on an island and send out colonizers to search the seas and take over newly found islands.  Eventually players will knock up against each other and can war.  The problem is that warring is much more expensive than taking over islands and building huts, that give VPs and more money, on those islands. 

My first game saw no fighting but I suppose that the group you play with could completely change that.  

I enjoyed the mechanics including the simple fighting rules but I expect some will be disappointed as it's an exploration game (therefore contains a good amount of luck in that you can find different levels of islands or open seas) and because it's pretty much a euro/war hybrid.

Used this to introduce Wargame ideas to my euro group. Most of the game is like a normal exploration/trading game. After you run out of areas to explore towards the end the warfare can be very quick and brutal. My euro pals were quite shocked by it. I liked it. I will play this again whenever offered the chance but it is a bit too wargamey for my group so I don't think it is going to hit the table that often.
Rules are pretty easy. Components are a bit dodgy. Counters are too similiar in colour for all sides and the map doesn't sit flat. I have pre ordered the deluxe one from GMT.

Superb theme and smooth game play.  Explore, settle, develop new technologies, and then crush your neighboring war bands with a surprise attack!

Not sure how terribly interesting this is, but it's rules-light enough that you could get people up and running fairly quickly.

As always, takers vs. makers.

Straightforward, easy to learn game with many strategic elements.  It's a lot of fun to explore and colonize the Pacific.  Hidden chits keep the game interesting and cause you to constantly be wondering whether your opponent is building a fleet of warriors to destroy you, or a host of colonies to grab the open village spaces you covet.  Yet, most conflict is indirect, so it is a game that also appeals to euro-style gamers.  The theme comes through with the culture cards.

Good fun with 2-4 players, so scales well.   Not really had much conflict in the games I've played so far.  Next time this hits the table I shall try to attack my opponents more frequently.

P500 order.  Received 12/01/2008.  Played a two player game; had fun.  Like the exploration although my opponent got way more Open Sea discoveries than I did.  I think this game will be best with 4 players, increasing the need for conflict.

Played another 2-player.  This game moves fast; easily completed within 2 hours.  Lots of fun exploring.  Definitely want to try with 3 or 4 players for increased conflict.

Cool theme. Has some interesting stuff going for it. The components are a mixed bag, though. The cards and dice are great, the chits are okay, but the map is kinda bad. It's very thin, flappy cardboard. I know some suggest laying a flat piece of glass on it, but I never have a large piece of glass with me. 

I like that you can win without combat, but that there is definitely an incentive to go war. The booklet with the game explaining the design and history of the Pacific is just awesome. You don't see that in many games, and it was very cool to read. 

I'd usually be up for this game, but it hasn't met with much interest from most of the people I know.

Update: Have brought this out a few more times. I enjoy the process of discovery. It feels like you are building a little empire. It is a bit of a pain to deal with the fiddly cardboard, but good game.

Played: 4 times.

[b]Conquest of Paradise[/b] by [person=2772][/person]
2-4 players

Empire Building in Polynesia, 500 A.D. 

Seems like a fun, light, fast-playing, easy-to-learn civ-game.

[i]Conquest of Paradise is a game of empire building in the "Polynesian Triangle" of the central Pacific Ocean for two, three, or four players. Players explore the unknown ocean around them, hoping to discover the most lucrative island groups, and colonize them. They build canoes and train warriors to create a force to defend their empire, while forging lines of communication with their developing discoveries. Resources are scarce; using them wisely is a key to victory. Investing in exploration widens your empire. Building warriors strengthens your empire. Investing resources into cultural innovations can yield unexpected dividends, like tattooing, hula dancing, surfing, or even the giant moai statues of Easter Island fame.

Conquest of Paradise is a well-tested, fast-playing design geared to appeal to players who enjoy games like New World, Civilization, and Conquistador. You can learn the game in 10-15 minutes and finish a complete game in 60-90 minutes.

Conquest of Paradise is a game of exploration and empire building, but also (as you'd expect from a GMT game) CONFLICT. Choosing when to build those expensive warriors, and when and where to fight, given limited resources, is key to your success.[/i]

This is a great light game that has enough mechanics that work well together to make it fun. I especially like this game to introduce new or novice players to the world of boardgames. I find it's also a great game to play with individuals, especially girlfriends or spouses, who would not neccessarily be interested in wargames. Although you can play with 2 players and still have a fun game, it's possible for a player to achieve victory and avoid any kind of conflict. Therefore I believe the game is best played with 3 or 4 players. I do think this is an underated game and should most certainly be ranked much higher in its category than a lot of other games on here.

It's either a peaceful luck-fest, finding the big islands, or it's a multi-player whack-fest of leader bashing, whereby the winner is the one who falls over the line due to being left alone just long enough.

1st play my initial 3 turns I just got dicked over by constant open ocean tiles,  being blown off course and then pressing my luck to try to find a frickin island, resulting in getting lost twice. Very hard to catch up against that. I was last whole game. 

Being last, you get to apply the event cards (as a catch-up mechanism). The ones I used were rather powerful. This was best part of the game for me.

It doesn't feel like p2p combat means much in this game. We only had a couple battles and I don't think any chits being lost. Player combat against neutral populated islands, on the other hand, seemed rewarding. But it also seemed the two most western starting isles had an overwhelmingly huge advantage towards taking those areas.

Game ended rather abruptly. I thought we'd have another 30-40 minutes when some of the regular cards helped push 2 people into contention for the sudden win. The two in contention were again the two west most nations.

While a lot of the bad things in the game might be realistic in theme  (being unlucky in exploring, starting point situational advantage, some pretty powerful player cards and event card events), this can translate to a very unevenly game to win. I'm not interested in a 2+ hour game like that.

I tried one game with my son. It's a fairly simple exploration and colonize game. But we both felt that something was missing. Maybe it's the fact that most of the exploration led to finding low value value islands/atolls and empty sea for the first 60 minutes of play. And we were not interested in doing combat, as it seems rather expensive in terms of resources. Maybe best played with more players or a better distribution of islands.

I feel like I must have missed something when we played this one. I REALLY REALLY wanted to like it. I saw a few minutes of a game being played and it looked good. But after 1.5 hours of play and no interaction between players, multiple rule checks that came up empty-handed where we had to make a guess to keep playing and the face-down chits that I didn't think needed to be face-down for playability all combined to throw this one off for me. I am waiting to play it again with someone outside my normal gaming group to see if we have just collectively missed the boat. All that aside, I LOVED the design notes with all of the history and general information - very cool!

Kevin McPartland, the designer, as stated that he wanted this to be a simulation above all, and I think he accomplished that and managed to design a great game also. Everything feels very thematic but, at the same time, the game has a small and compact rule set. Exploring is fun and well implemented and finding the right balance between economy and war is not easy. It's hard to defend everything and the combat system really encourages the less fortunate players to try and grab the stuff they need from the others. The cards provide additional flavor and can have some devastating effects, so it's a good idea to draw some. 

And if you lose, you can always complain about the dice luck, or the unfortunate exploring. :)

It's a light 4X. Unique theme, some unique mechanics. Plays pretty quick for a 4X style game. 

But, the round structure feels a little clunky and procedural. I would have been better had they streamlined and modernized the rules -- e.g. combat -- and updated the aesthetics of the game. Movement is a bit of a bottleneck, especially when regard to direct player interaction. I don't think the decisions were that difficult. 

It's OK, but I don't know if I'd ever suggest it.

A lighter civilization game with a couple of nice hooks.
While it does not have a tech tree, Your advancements (if you could call cannibalism an advancement) do not depend on each other. It does have exploration  element (yes it can be unbalancing if you draw poorly). However the mix of tiles will throw different players into combat.
Also your plans have to be flexible depending on islands drawn - good islands - settle and grow, poor islands prepare for conflict.

Conflict is expensive and chancy, however it can cause major victory point swings as you deny points to the enemy as well as acquiring your own. 

The game starts slow since resources are limited, but quickly gets to the point when you realize you have to steal islands or break the island chains from the leader to keep him from winning. 
Couple with cards that may not have been played, but have victory points with them, give you a fairly rich scenario.

CoP is somewhat fiddly and looks like a wargame with stacks of chits spread out over a field of hexes.  But it is an amazing empire building game.  It's short (2-3 hours), has an orginal theme and a unique implementation.  I'm impressed by how much game was crammed in to the play time.  You can conquer your opponents, conquer pre-existing civilizations, focus on exploration and developement or, most likely, all of the above.  It includes everything but trading with other players.  A nice touch is that you can throw in some of the advanced rules which make the game more fiddly but add more options and chrome.

A fast playing medium/light 4X game in Polynesia. There is no complex combat rules, neither is there rules for any kind of diplomacy or trading, so sooner or later there is going to be conflicts (But hey it’s a GMT game). Conquest of Paradise is a kind of game that would benefit with some more depth, don’t get me wrong, it’s an enjoyable game, but while playing the feeling that there is something missing is sneaking up on you.

Only one play and I'd be willing to give it a couple more tries.  There may be too much luck in the game to make it 'good.'  Also, as I've heard others say: the game ends just when things start to get going: you've got a couple islands and can now build some warriors, but someone else scores enough to win without doing anything!

Played it few times four-player. So far, so good, though we're having issues with tile-draw luck.

I think I'm liking it a little more than most of the rest of the group. The main bone of contention is that while *in theory* the 3rd and 4th players should be able to get draws that give them a shot with the first two positions, so far it's just not happening.

Lots of hidden information in this game. During the discovery phase, chits are pulled to explore the Pacific. Players hope to find islands and atoll chains, but could just as easily spend their 5 exploration moves (each chit has an exploration cost from 0-3) discovering open sea, or being blown off course. Islands are placed face down until a player is ready to move to it, providing the discovering player with an advantage for finding it. Players then build a movement network using their transport canoes, and in the movement phase these are used to transport chits. Villages placed on inhabitable islands score victory points, but opponents can always wage a battle (most basic d6 based rolls, with culture cards acting as a powerful modifier) to destroy your villages and take over your scoring chain.

Overall, I like this game a lot.

I like the component. Having a wargaming background, chits do not bother me, after a while you get fond of them. Yes, the map is not as sturdy as it could be, but I would rather a game gets into production even if it means the map is rather thin. The artwork is in sync with the game theme. Overall, I think every gamer and game designer would like to have the best map and pieces possible, but the reality is a lot of games would then never get produced.

The rules are short, simple, and concise. Once you play the game awhile the rule book goes away from game play.

I like the random tile placement - contrary to many others complaints of being luck driven - then again what game does not have any luck? The tile placement mechanic fits in well with the time to play the game. You may draw more of the bum tiles but you can still win the game. Also, the game does not take that long, so you can always play another game. Then, look at it from the other players perspective, who got the fat juicy islands, they feel like they won the lottery and have had a good game - which they could still blow through a poor follow-up and through others good play.

I like the combat system, yes it is simple but for this game it works. It has the flavor of a warband attacking another warband - and not Operation Barbarossa - which fits the theme of the game. What if this game had a "realistic" combat system? - then there would then be complaints of the overly complex combat system. For the games scope and time frame the combat system is a good fit.

I like the exploration system, again not overly complicated and it is does its job well. It has a mix of randomness (the knots) and determinism (the knot limits) so that you know you may explore but you don't know how much.

I like the building system, again not overly complicated. The build requirements and the build points seem equitable and not excessive. The build system also fits in well with the theme - you are building for stone age cultures so you have appropriate items to build.

The only part of the game that might be deficient for some game groups, is the player interaction. There is only a rudimentary (not handled in the rules) system of diplomacy, so the diplomacy is of table-talk variety - "attack him, he is winning" etc. Players only interaction via the rules is warfare, which for some game groups (think wargamers) may be what they are accustomed to.

Overall, great game Kevin, keep up the good work.

Thanks, Rob Lawrence

 Although our group got into a bit of "groupthink" early on, conscious efforts broke the pattern, and we discovered alternate strategies which lead to victory.  Our most recent conclusion seems to be that arts & culture cards are too powerful, because they are VP's which can never be taken away (and one game was broken on a double tie-breaker of "total cards in hand").

This game has proven to have long term staying power. It is fun to pull out once in a while. And we haven't found anyone who doesn't like it, yet.

A nice effort with some problems. An attempt at a euro-wargame hybrid which makes it a little hard to evaluate. If judged as a euro then I suppose it is brilliant - it has an actual theme & a system which plays to that theme, and, unlike the great steaming pile of vacuity which comprises the bulk of euro-gaming it has a soul! The great strength of the design is that it oozes the designer's love of subject from every rules page & in every turn. There is not the slightest hint of the feeling one gets after playing a euro - that you've just spent the night in a second rate disco where some sleezeoid in a slick suit kept trying to jump your girlfriend. This doesn't mean that dyed-in-the-wool euro-gamers will like it though & I suppose that is one of it's problems. It's production values & systemic basics are solidly wargame (no plastic/wooden toys; a great deal of randomness; the need to operate in a reasonably historical manner & the 'fiddlyness' that that involves etc etc). I played my only game so far against my 10 year daughter & she disliked it for all those reasons & I dare say that she is a reliable guide to how other gaming tweens would feel. I noted in the forums that some guy was moaning that it should have a combat system like Antke's - oh deary dear. 

So, if CoP is the rejected King of Euros, will it find a home amongst the wargaming tribes in the outer regions? That's a hard one since the compromises made to eurodom may well sour the tribes towards it (& you can find plenty of prejudice amongst the beserker grognards towards anything that tries to leave the door open to the mainstream, no matter how intelligently made that door is). I probably need a few more plays to decide if it can function as a serious game & then maybe my rating will go up.

One thing which is keeping that rating down at the moment though is the map, which is an absolute absolute absolute disgrace. In all of the hundreds of games which I've owned, played or seen I have not ever seen anything so disfunctional as the great maw caused by the lie of the map & which falls in the most imprtant & populated area of the board - what horrors the Samoan people have had to endure, what with the earth opening up every 5 minutes or so & swallowing villages, canoes, warriors etc. Oh the humanity. I note also, gob-smacked, some of the blytheness that the supporters of the game bring to the forums about this - it's fine, just get some perspex; stick a rock on it etc etc. I'm sorry but what planet are you guys on?

Caveat:  comments after one game.

Seems to have a property typical of most exploration games--If you get particularly unlucky on exploring, you really have no chance.  (One player continually finds open ocean or atolls and someone else lucks into Hawaii, New Zealand and Tahiti.)  It remains to be seen if the player stuck in this situation can use combat or other tactics to get out of the hole.

But the other elements of the game seem to work well.  Definitely one whose rating can improve.

Also some of the best Designer Notes I have seen in a game that provide a lot of historical background to an era I didn't know much about.

Great 90 minute civ type game. I was really impressed with it. I played one game and watched several others through the course of the convention it was demo'd at. 

It's a shame the production value GMT will apply to this game won't match its mechanics. If this game was produced by someone like Ystari, HiG, Fantasy Flight, or any other major player the game would have as much hype as Caylus did last year. It's sad that such a great game gets the P500 treatment and won't get the exposure it deserves.

Quick and light game that shines through the facts that it works relatively well with three players, has an unconventional setting and one or two unusual mechanics. I like the balance between peaceful expansion and military action; I wouldn't want to play this, however, as a purely economic game (as some seem to do) -- the tension in choosing between building armed forces and peaceful growth is what makes it exciting to play.

There is quite a bit of luck involved, so don't play it if you don't like this. For a game of 1 1/2 to 2 hours, though, I think the level of luck is acceptable; if you're unlucky in one game, you often have a chance to play another.

Wow, did this fall flat with our group.  The theme is great and well integrated into the gameplay but, unfortunately, the gameplay was sorely lacking.  It was really cumbersome to constantly look at your hidden units and reveal your transport canoe chains.  Exploration was enjoyable, but building and buying cards, though simple, was unsatisfying.  

The simple combat system, I think, really hurt this one.  Building up even a small force to take a lightly defended island takes a tremendous amount of resources and you can still be hosed by the dice.  I get that you're supposed to do small, quick raids with limited forces and cut off your opponents' transport canoe chains, but it's frustrating to spend so much for a 50/50 chance at success in fairly matched combat.

There must be better light 4X games out there.  Normally, I'd give a game a second play before throwing it on the sell pile, but not this one.

A nice simple game, but unlikely to leave a strong impression either way.

Not quite a wargame, not quite a Euro. The solid graphics and components and rulebook bode well for GMT's next batch o' stuff.

GMT Game in the "light" category, it offers a decent experience although I'd had to play it more often to see how to minimise the disadvantage to find too many "open water" tiles, which proves to be much hampering on the long run.
However, the rest of the mechanics are OK, except for that "hide" mechanism where you have to stack the tiles to protect information from others, but it also protect those information from you so that you have to check repeatedly the stacks to be sure you move the right ones.

Pre-ordered July, 2007, arrived Dec. 10, 2007, 1st play Dec.29th

 Having played a couple of times, with both 3 & 4 players, I can safely say I like this game a lot. The luck swinga are there, but you can mitigate some of it with wise planning and bold blufss and moves. The first game i played peacefully until late in the game. My somewhat hidden horde of military units  blitzed into a few key island groups and gave me the win.
 The 2nd game, I did the opposite and that also worked!
  Bluff strongly, be bold and daring and, you might not win, but you should be close and have fun while doing it!

Great theme to mechanics gameplay. Players are trying to explore and colonise the South Pacific. Villages give build points, which are used to build more villages, transport canoes, war canoes, warriors etc.

The exploration phase is rather 'Entdecker' like: player flip over a chit that's either open sea, blows ship off course or an island discovery. Chits have knot symbols on the back that determine when players stop.

Discovered islands can later be attacked and colonised. Toss in the ubiquitious development cards for extra VPs grabs.

Can get a bit fiddly with stacks of hidden chits. Gah! But still worth playing.

A Wargame/Euro hybrid that didn't learn from either roots.  

It just isn't economically efficient to attack other players, especially with such extreme random results, which means that it is better to turtle and build your infrastructure.  The economic engine is systematic and dull and entirely based on the luck of the draw, but those that are successful will be on a rich get richer track.  The only way to stop them is to attack, but it just isn't worth attacking the more powerful player.  Better to attack the weak player that couldn't get their engine up and running.  

Everything that is wrong about the modern multiplayer wargame system.

I really wanted to like it, but honestly I feel that I just didn't have enough control over my destiny for my taste.  Not enough room here for, what I feel, is any type of clever play.

Here's my strategy guide:
Draw good island tiles, get high victory points on Culture cards.  Don't get attacked, don't attack anyone unless they leave their pants down.

This was a nice change of pace, and it did have hexes and small cardboard chits, just like the wargames I used to play.  The theme is well-done, and I like the exploration and settlement; however, I think that the warriors are too expensive and it seems not to be very worthwhile to wage war.  Perhaps in the game I played, if we had more conflict early on, we would have thought about building more warriors.

Plays very differently with 2, 3, or 4 players, but I suspect it's best with an even number.  More playing will confirm this.  Attacking islands is risky, but it's easy to cut off a transport chain ... for a turn.  Then vengeance is swift!  If you suspect someone has a better position, attack sooner rather than later, so their Build Points don't give them an even greater edge.

*2nd edition* - rules have some really wonky wording that I would've expected to have been cleaned up in the new edition.

Not Polynesian 4X, more like 3.5X (but that's OK). Beautiful production!

Lots of luck here, but necessary (random exploration, plus interesting chrome in the form of event cards and arts & culture cards), not to mention combat (keep rolling a single die). The push-your-luck element (knots) of exploring is especially clever.

Has detailed solo rules, which I pretty much prefer over the multi-player experience. I really appreciate the extensive Designer's Notes documentation, too. 

Overall, a decent game.

Combat is too simplistic, the game itself does not incite players to fight eachother. In our four player game each player explored and settled in an entirely different direction of the board. This was a two hour waste of time, which I think is the first time in my life I will say about playing a board game. The only area where this game delivers (yet, does not excel) is the production value of the components.

A light civilization building game, uniquely set in Polynesia. The gameplay is highly thematic, with islands to explore, war canoes to build, and the game's random setup means that there's always a new challenge (even if it unbalances the game at times). I wish this one had cooler bits to help convince friends to play, but if you get a chance, give it a try.

A good eXploration/eXpansion/eXtermination game (3X out of 4X ain't bad), but my first session at least didn't feel as tense as I'd expect with so much hidden information.  It actually felt a bit dry.  Perhaps it would become more exciting/dramatic with experience.  (I think we were all a little gun shy, so not much interaction.)

I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly the game played.  Or maybe I wasn't, because it seemed to end suddenly, just when things were getting interesting.  Hmmm...

I'd like to play it again.

One of my favorite themes ever, and I love the explorable map.  The solitaire mode is decent -- not worth it on its own but nice to have on occasion.

Having now had the chance to play this with one other player, I really want to try with more!  Two-player games have so far felt very zero-sum: if I take your island, you lose points, I gain points, and it's harder for you to come back.  That said I also think we're only beginning to scratch the surface of the overall strategy.  If the players decide to race for islands, then the game will go to whoever gets the best tiles.  But a few well-placed war canoes can upset that balance very quickly....

I was a bit let down by this game. I had hopes of it being the 4x game for me but it just wasn't. Seems to be a some glaring holes in the game. The lack of incentive to initiate combat for one. The game felt to me like it was a 2 player game design where as an after thought they threw in the 3rd and 4th player starting positions and gave them the sweet potato route as a consolation prize. I admit there are some clever things going on and the turn sequence is very keen...but it's not enough to make me want to play this one over 100's of other games and for me that's what it comes down to...how much do I want to play said game...

Good theme. Heavy on luck though. Explore to discover new lslands, develope those islands with villages and protect them or you can battle for opponents existing islands. Build boats, armies, colonists, ect. Combat is very simple and a bit of a let down (1D6 1-3 effects the attacker 4-6 effects the defender) Unlike New World though, this games main focus is on discovery and building rather then combat. The game is very simple and elegant and flows very well but my biggest gripe with this game is the rules, there is a lot of contradiction and many much needed examples of play and of combat are absent which leaves alot of constant refering to the rules, BGG posts or guesswork. Even the newer rules from GMT seem more like a simple spellcheck. It might as well have been written in Latin. It took a good 2 days trying to figure out how to play. Also the game uses a "Fog of War" which just doesn't translate well into a non block game. There is still fun to be had here though, the theme is great and a well change of pace from WW II or other strategy games and it can be played in about 1 1/2 hours which is a good choice for a days session. The designer's notes is also a nice add and well worth the read.

Disappointing.  We may have been the victims of group-think, but this came across as multi-player solitaire, driven by who got luckiest with the tile draw and buying cards.  There *should* have been conflict to take down the leading player, but no-one could see a way to afford to get off the economic-engine treadmill for long enough to explore the military side.

Maybe it plays differently if people are more willing to pick a fight at the right time, but I can't see me (or anyone else I played with) being keen to give it a second chance.

It's a shame, the theme is great, and I really wanted to like this.

A true 4X game with Canoes! Yay!
A bit too random for my taste (if you happen to draw bad/empty tiles to those crucial hexes that surround your base it's gonna be a huge challenge to keep up with your opponents) The 2 player game feels much more balanced and less luck driven than the multiplayer mode. Despite these annoyances the game actually shines as a gem. Too bad it isn't more popular.
Also the game begs for an expansion with more complex cards and more varied units.
Since the eurogaming crowd clearly ignored this beautiful game the designer should convert it full scale to a wargamish 4x game.
Really nice.

If one starts falling behind in developing, it's time to make a move. This can mean flanking attacks with war canoes to cut island chains away from the home island, or a very considered invasion. It isn't a bloody CRT and most loses are retreats of pieces that can return to the edges of your island empire (if not the front). Attacks are best as considered moves based on preperation and - likely being behind forcing the issue - the advantage of turn-order & surprise. And hey, gambling for that outlier sequence of good or bad rolls that dramatize a turning point is a great feeling.

Luck heavy.. so it's hard to predict which way the game is gonna go. Wind direction? The Polynesian theme interests me greatly and it's quite beautiful all set up (w/a little extra pimping by moi). Random Event cards from C3i #22 add more interest (and even more luck). A real game board would be cool.. and my original 'map' doesn't lay out correctly.. [i]the cut is defective, so it won't close up completely, even under "plexi"[/i]. I probably should have asked for a replacement in 2010.. duh. Maybe I can trim it. Will I be paying thru-the-nose, for a "Deluxe Edition"? Make that a big fat, fuckin' [b][size=10]NO[/size][/b].

Would I upgrade my [i]map[/i]? Maybe.. if the price was right. [i][color=blue]How many years do I have to wait?[/color][/i] Looking for a full set of (replacement) explorers/ships too. *hint-hint*

Second Edition is quite nice. Exploration games will always be a little random, Though my card pulls were over 50% 0VP value. I didn't mind it much. However, the imbalance of the starting islands seemed unjustifiable. I'd house rule either an extra build point, a starting colony or add a developed space.

Truly a treasure! Absolutely drenched in theme and very easy to pick up, I can think of no other game quite like it. There is a substantial luck factor, but it never detracts from the deep gameplay.

RATING: 6
Not convinced at all about this one.  It's neat as a simulation, but as a competition, it has some problems.  Discovering lucrative islands early is a necessity for a win, as it allows your economic engine to snowball quickly.  Better islands equals more villages, which means more production.  Also not sure about the idea of factionalized empire-building.  My understanding is that the game takes place over hundreds of years, and that historically these islands functioned more-or-less independently.  The factions are much more reflective of nations or empires than they are of city-state style politics.  I hurts me to say this, but this might be better modeled as a city-state influence-driven euro game than as a socioeconomic wargame.  Regardless, CoP plays quickly, and it's interesting to examine the history and get an idea of the way of life.  Not a great game, but probably worth a play or two for theme.

Fun, mostly because it was short-ish. The island drawing mechanism feels a little too random, but I suspect that the brevity of the game pays back a bit or this: about the same length and complexity as Seafarers of Catan. If you liked that, or Tahuantinsuyu, then you might like this.

Rating on this one could go up or down.  I really want to like this one, as it has a lot of things going for it.  Unfortunately, the luck factor of island placement might be too much to overcome.  I think 3 players isn't tense enough, as there is too much room.  Also, if the far off island gets hosed in discovery, it is too far to try to attack its way back into the game.  I want to try with four.

Interesting theme, but very clunky game. (I especially don't like the "hidden" mechanic where mistakes are all too easy to make. Why would this not work if everything were face up? Just buy simultaneously and in secret, and then reveal.)
Next to no player interaction in a three-handed game.

This is in a way a very simple 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate) game.  Explore and expand are crucial, you exploit (build villages and trade routes).  Exterminate not so much - it is possible to win this game without a single battle, thru building villages and buying culture.  But that is probably unlikely since opponents will probably see that coming and try to stop you.  A fine, light wargame/heavy euro cross.

Edit: I helped playtest the upcoming solitaire variant.  It is very good.

Plays better (but longer) with 4 due to the increased interaction.  2&3 player games were a race to VP totals.  Last 3 turns with 4 were very tight and any island group could have won.  Luck is present throughout the game but goes with the theme.

This is without a doubt the best exploration game I've played. The theme is very engaging and, unlike most exploration games, actually has the feel of sailing out into the unknown. The components are solid, but I think better player colours would have been advisable, particularly to help colour-blind players. All-in-all an excellent game on an area and a period of history that gets very little coverage.

I really like the exploration aspect of this game.  It has an area control feel to it due to the limited number of discoverable sea hexes available.  So it is possible to section a sizable part for your own use as the play progresses.  There is also the press your luck mechanic as you take the chance of drawing more knots than your ship can handle.  However, the militaristic part of the game is what I didn't care for.  Not only does it involve die rolling, the numerous chits one has to pick up and move, as well as the fact that the units are placed hidden faced down on the board, made the entire process all that much painful.  Luckily, with 3-players we only had to resort to combat once before the victory condition was reached, but I imagine that with 4 it is probably impossible to avoid conflicts.

Furthermore, the NPC islands seemed almost extraneous and useless.  Since the other players can simply take advantage of you after you have depleted your units fighting these natives.  So who in his right mind would try to conquer them when there are more immediate enemies to deal with?

As it stands, Conquest of Paradise feels like an incomplete package, one that starts out good but finishes poorly.  It is probably a good civilization-esque game for 2-3 players with non-aggressive play style, not something I see myself playing very often though.

- Culture cards too powerful not to buy one every turn

Overall, a great design. Looking forward to the GMT reprinting.

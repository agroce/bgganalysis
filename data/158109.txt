An area control game with eight celestial bodies from our solar system representing the areas.  Central to the game are three random elements.  The first is tiles placed in each area three times during the game.  These tiles represent sites for mines and factories, potential crises, tensions between the player powers, alien big game, and the chance to draw new action cards.  The first two are critical to control of the area, while a tension tile provides the only opportunity to take control of another player's mine or factory.  In the absence of those three tile types, control of an area will not change.  The second random element is the cards; some are much more powerful than others, some are highly situational, others are broadly applicable. The third random element is the dice used to assess all sorts of conflict, from taking over a mine to shooting big game.  While the potential is there for some very swingy results, these can be mitigated by plenty of action cards.  Together, I think those three elements drive the game a little too much.

As others have commented, the crises don't seem to work very well. The concept of different forms of alien resistance to colonisation arising had potential.  However, it seems far too easy to snuff out crises before they develop.  They may also feature in a bizarrely drawn out end game in which the players scour the solar system for 1 vp crises or big game tiles because there is nothing else to do.   

Onward to Venus' artwork is really very nice and production quality is good.  We had fewer issues with this set of Wallace rules than with others.

A few weeks after playing Onward to Venus, it mostly forgotten. I legitimately don't remember how combat works, or what the various tiles are for or do. The only thing I remember is the passing turn mechanic (which was neat). Ultimately, I think that says everything about this game.

Εδώ έχουμε ένα από τα τελευταία δημιουργήματα του κ.Wallace. Το theme του παιχνιδιού έχει να κάνει με την αποίκηση πλανητών στο ηλιακό μας σύστημα. Είναι κάπως retro και ταυτόχρονα sci-fi η αισθητική στο artwork και μου άρεσε αρκετά.

Το παιχνίδι είναι ουσιαστικά area control αφού στο τέλος ο κάθε πλανήτης δίνει πόντους σε αυτούς που έχουν τα περισσότερα εργοστάσια και ορυχεία εκεί. Οπότε θεωρητικά έχουμε ένα κλασσικό παιχνίδι ‘φτιάχνω στρατό, κατακτώ πλανήτες, χτίζω εκεί εργοστάσια, πλακώνομαι με τους αντιπάλους’ αλλά στην πράξη τα πράματα δεν είναι ακριβώς έτσι.

Στην πραγματικότητα το τι action μπορείς να κάνεις σε κάποιον πλανήτη καθορίζετε από τα 3-4 τυχαία tiles που τοποθετούμε εκεί στην αρχή του κάθε γύρου. Αυτό εκτός του ότι είναι απίστευτα random δημιουργεί και κωμικοτραγικές καταστάσεις, στον ένα πλανήτη μπορεί να βρέχει εργοστάσια και σε κάποιον άλλο να μην βγει ορυχείο σε όλο το παιχνίδι. Επίσης δε πα να έχεις τον άπειρο στρατό, αν δεν βγει τοκενάκι για attack μόνο σε neutral ορυχεία μπορείς να πας. Το ειρωνικό φυσικά είναι να βγει το τοκενάκι πολέμου σε δικό σου πλανήτη.

Συνεπώς επειδή είναι σημαντικό το ποιος θα προλάβει να αρπάξει το κάθε τόκεν, το turn order είναι υψίστης σημασίας. Και πως καθορίζετε αυτό? Υπάρχει ένα action ‘πάσο και τραβάς μια κάρτα’, όποιος κάνει το 6ο πάσο θα παίξει πρώτος στον επόμενο γύρο. Αυτό ουσιαστικά σημαίνει πως κανείς δεν θέλει να πει το 5ο πάσο αφού μετά ο επόμενος από σένα θα πει πάσο για παίξει πρώτος και εσύ τελευταίος. Και ακόμη χειρότερα υπάρχει το action move που απλά μετακινείς κάνα διαστημόπλοιο οπότε μπορείς να τραβήξεις το παιχνίδι όσο θες. Έχω στο μυαλό μου κάτι competitive παρέες μου, που μπορούν να τραβήξουν το παιχνίδι για ώρες κάνοντας αδιάφορα move αριστερά δεξιά για να μην παίξουν τελευταίοι στον επόμενο γύρο. 

Και το randomness συνεχίζετε. Υπάρχει μια κοινή τράπουλα για όλους από την οποία παίρνουμε κάρτες. Τι να σχολιάσω εδώ. Έχει μέσα τα πάντα, από πολύτιμες κάρτες με free actions και μεγάλα bonus στο attack μέχρι άχρηστες ή έστω πολύ situational κάρτες. Μεγάλη διαφορά στην δύναμη των καρτών και υπόψην τραβάς καμιά δεκαριά μόνο σε όλο το παιχνίδι. Ότι σου κάτσει δηλαδή.

Να πω και για το σύστημα μάχης?? Ρίχνεις 3 εξάπλευρα ζάρια και κρατάς την διαφορά του μεγαλύτερου από του μικρότερου, αν τυχόν φέρεις skull(μετράει σαν 0) τότε πρέπει να θυσιάσεις μια μονάδα. Το σύστημα αυτό έχει μεγάλες διακυμάνσεις. Για το ίδιο ορυχείο ο ένας παίκτης μπορεί να χρειαστεί 1 πόντο δύναμης και ο άλλος 6 πόντους και 1-2 απώλειες. Δεν βγαίνει άκρη. Πραγματικά βλέπεις το ορυχείο μπροστά σου και δεν έχεις ιδέα αν θα χρειαστείς 2-3 φαντάρους ή 7-8.

Στο παιχνίδι υπάρχουν και τα crisis τοκενς. Αν μαζευτούν σε κάποιον πλανήτη 3-4 από αυτά και οι παίκτες δεν αντιδράσουν (πάνε να τα πολεμήσουν) τότε θα συμβούν κάποια αρνητικά events. Υπάρχει μια ολόκληρη σελίδα με θεματικά events ανά πλανήτη. Βέβαια στην πράξη δεν είδαμε τίποτα αφού δεν έγινε ποτέ. Και πως θα μπορούσε να γίνει όταν υπάρχουν μόνο 13 tiles σε ένα σακούλι με 100+ από τα οποία δεν παίζουν όλα σε κάθε παιχνίδι. Και φυσικά τα tiles τα μοιράζουμε μεταξύ 7 πλανητών. Οπότε η πιθανότητα να κάτσουν 3-4 στον ίδιο πλανήτη είναι πολύ μικρή.

Θα συγχωρούσα όλα τα παραπάνω αν τουλάχιστον το παιχνίδι ήταν κάπως ρευστό στο ποιος θα κερδίσει. Απεναντίας έχει το πιο anti-climactic φινάλε που έχω δει σε area control παιχνίδι. Ούτε καν το κλασσικό ύπουλο «θα του κάνω μια επίθεση την τελευταία στιγμή για να του κλέψω ένα εργοστάσιο και να πάρω την πρώτη θέση στον πλανήτη» δεν μπορείς να εφαρμόσεις αφού τα τοκενς είπαμε ανοίγουν τυχαία και είναι φανερά σε όλους. Στην τελευταία γύρα δηλαδή γίνονται στα γρήγορα οι 2-3 μάχες που έκατσαν και μετά τριγυρνάμε στο διάστημα για κάνα 20λεπτο κάνοντας κινήσεις για 1 VP (πχ πολεμώντας τα crisis tiles). 

Κάτω από την βάση.

RATING: 7.5
Enjoyed my first plays: a fun and well-realised theme in an area control game with just a little bit of conflict. Simple basic mechanisms but lots of variety through the cards, tiles, and various ways players can interact. Crises potentially don't come up enough; the last turn may have a tendency to slow down quite a lot, but on my second play I liked it a lot more than my first (where I was surprised by a powerful card!)

I've got a few nitpicks about some of the production in the game, in particular I feel the stunning artwork could be displayed a little more throughout some of the pieces, but otherwise this is just a hilarious romp of a game. I love that you have the separate 'boards' for each of the planets in the game's system, and the Crisis effects feel thematic, the ray guns are great, the rules are fairly light but it's not without some strategy. Mechanically this may not be Wallace's best design, but the retro future theme from the graphic novels which inspired it puts it over the top for me. Love. this. game.

RATING: 6
Initial rating - first play.

It's an odd beast this game. It has huge, swingy randomness in the form of the tile bag dice and card deck, giving it the trappings of a Ameritrash area control game. But it also has a very Euro first player mechanism, economic elements and non-random combat. It also severely limits aggression by restricting player combat to 'tension' tiles. Thrown into the mix is Archipelago style crises, which require some measure of cooperation in a purely competitive game.

There's a lot to like about the game. It's absolutely gorgeous, with fantastic art and lovely pieces (in the Limited Ed. at least), but it also has a big serve of randomness that makes it feel a little chaotic. It's hard to know if that decreases with experience or not at this point. I'm keen to play more, to see if there's some hidden order beneath the chaos, but right now it feels like an experiment.

5 players is too many. I get the feeling 3 would hum along, and give it a niche where there's clearer air. At 5, it's going head to head with Kemet, Risk Legacy and Chaos in the Old World, and it doesn't hang with Kemet or Chaos.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Thematic and low complexity, yet full of tension as the turns roll.  Loads of cards and enough event variety due to crisis tiles that no two games will be exactly the same. I don't want to hear it about the randomness, I really don't - don't make me blast you with the Moon Hater!  I'm in favor of the variant where you roll dice = to number of players in the crisis resolution phase.
****
May have to admit I was wrong on this one. Dropping steadily with more plays. My 1st game was extremely tense due to serious competition on earth due to the perfect storm of crisis, tension, and mines. One turn we're helping eachother, and the next we're killing eachother.  Hasn't happened again. I love agony in a game, but most of the agony comes from the afformentioned randomness, not player interaction.  Maybe I just need to learn to appreciate that?  The thing is, there is competition out there for my precious gaming time. Needs some tweaking to separate itself from the pack of similar games.

I was the only one on my table that was rather enthousiastic about this game. It's a strange setting, board and way to victory. I must admit that after reading the rules, I was in a certain doubt, but the games explanation is rather easy and the actions are clear. The only thing you really have to look up are the different Crisises.

Limited Edition with wooden pieces #34 out of 1500

I'm hesitant on my rating for this title. On the one hand, the theme and mechanics employed are usually not my cup of tea, but on the other hand I had so much fun while playing it.

This is a light area-majority game with elements of luck, tactical decisions, card hand management and a lot of "take that" which can translate into a wonderful experience. Played with the right group can make the game shine, but played with the wrong group and it can fall flat. Well, that could be said of most games; so take that comment with a grain of salt.

Onward to Venus has beautiful production values, a quirky eccentric entertaining theme, fun gameplay employing interesting choices while playing quickly and not overstaying it's welcome.

Update: Can run a little long with five players or with the wrong group.

RATING: 4
2 h long game, without real depth and some bad design decisions. I do not want to play a 2 h game and be fucked over because someone draw an ultra powerful card, that allows him to destroy something extremely expensive owned by another player in a crucial turn. 
Apart from that there is not enough game there to accept 2 hours of playtime.

This lived up to expectations and I can honestly say I like it! Another interesting twist on area control with great art. Early complaints where that the game felt clunky and fiddly. My first play proved this to be incorrect.

"The ancient race of Moon Men toil below the surface building their rockets, working
towards the day when they can destroy the Earth."

  Update: In all honesty this game is a solid 6, though my own rating is hire, and it had the potential chance to be a 9. It reminds me a bit of "Way Out West" in the fact that with a few minor house rule changes you can really improve its play.

Rather than Onward to Venus, a more appropriate title for this game would be Backward to Euros, as it wastes such a great theme like the steampunkish Dr. Grordbort’s infallible shooting skills on a soulless game: as a matter of fact there’s no point in having starships, tanks and troops if you cannot attack the other players, which the game prevents you from doing by simply turning your military into just another resource you need to exploit in order to grind your road to victory points...I mean, the economical dominion over the Solar system.

I had great expectations from a game that carried such a wonderful art and the unlimited potential of a steampunk boiler: yet in the end it’s just a lackluster with a great but uncapitalized-on theme pasted on.

Ugh, so much potential marred by some very poor design decisions. I love the theme, the components, and the whole look of the game. The mechanics are solid at the core, with lots of tight competition over spots and interesting card-driven mechanics. However, the range of die modifiers players are required to beat (0-6) is far too large to be satisfyingly manageable, and some card powers are vastly superior to others. 

Worst of all is the fact that you can't attack a planet unless tension tokens are present. This means that some players get an easy stranglehold on a location with no opportunity for other players to retaliate; similarly, being able to add tension tokens toward the end of the game can instantly win someone the game. The cards that allow you to retain other used cards make such imbalances even more pronounced. I'd consider trying this again if some fixes were put in place.

RATING: 7.25
After 1st play: A seemingly light strategy game but it has a decent amount of depth.  Kind of worker placement-ish although it doesn't feel that way.  Very unique feel and there's not really any games similar to it.

The game is a bit random due to a large deck of swingy cards and tiles being drawn out of a bag which determine what you can do on each planet.  The notion that you can't attack another player unless you use one of these limited resource tiles that also happen to be a Conflict tile can be a negative detractor for some.  

The Crises that are unique for each planet is one of the most interesting elements and maybe my favorite part of the design.  There's talk these almost never occur and it could be a problem with the design, however, we saw two Crises almost occur in a 5 player game.  The threat of them occurring definitely had an effect on the game.

Right now, I very much enjoy this game and am looking forward to future plays.  It played briskly with five and the mechanisms are easy to get through and enjoyable.

--------------------------------

Several games in I'm really enjoying this one.  Still wish the Crises hit a little more often, but the overall game is good fun and features great flavor and some nice tension.  Very different game.

*6* (Initial plays)
Parts of this game are great. The Mechanics and theme work well, and the passing mechanic is a nice addition. For the length of play I feel the game has too many random elements. The cards are very swingy, from amazing to eh. There is a heavy reliance on rolling the dice well in this one. I do like the amount of tension and decision making regardless. Something I would play on occasions.

RATING: 5
There just isn't enough interesting ideas here to really make this one worth it, and I'm not sure playing well leads to an increased chance of winning. The Crisis tiles would have made this one a lot more interesting IF they weren't super easy to take care of and you didn't need to continually reference the rule book table to see what they did. I don't know, I'll pass on this one next time, as its not exactly a short game either.

This is essentially an area control game (which means I will naturally prefer this over other genres). Enjoyed it on the first play through. It dragged due to AP, however I expect it would get faster with more plays. 

It was also surprisingly balanced with a close finish at the end, with players who had a bad start (due mainly to it being the first play through) coming up to threaten the win at the end. Like many other Wallace games, timing is absolutely essential (when to play cards, take tiles, take pass cubes to place you higher up in the turn order etc).

Overall it's a good game, but it doesn't strike me as something I want to play again straight away. I would however like to play again at some point.

Fast turns, good game balance, always something to do make this a great game.  Dice rolls add just enough uncertainty but not so much that you do not feel in control.  The cardboard pc all look a little same.  I wish they had different shape punch outs.  The last round can leave you with little to do which I have found bothers people.  Not every game turns out that way.  It depends on the tiles you pull.

Notes:

Definitely a light to mid weight game and must be played as such. Luck of the draw plays a big roll in both the cards you are dealt and the dice rolled - it can be frustrating at times. Good fun to be had overall, keeps you engaged. Theme comes across nicely, with a bit of take that for good measure.

Great surprise after first play. Fun and tense game, not so light as it seems. Timing is critical, strategy esential, and you can recover from bad start if playing cards combos thinkfully. I like to see how much depth it has after many plays.

Update: More plays and many surprises. Luck is a factor here, but card combo, crisis management and some roleplaying is so exciting. Not a game for slow pace, but fast, funny and big surprises that strike in last movement.

I think that getting two cards (instead of one) when you get panultimate pass cube is a good change for better playing, but I should test it.

RATING: 8.5
An enjoyable well themed area majority steam-punk space romp. It poses quite a few interesting strategic and tactical decisions for the players but is still fairly lite and has a couple of elements of luck (card draws and dice) which will not be to everyone's taste, but for me is fine for the weight and length of the game.

There are a couple of flies in the ointment - the 'crises' feel a little underdeveloped in terms of their likely impact and effects on the game, especially on the final turn where their effects become largely irrelevant. There are also a couple of very powerful swingy cards - this feeling is based on one play so may prove not to be justified as more plays with knowledge of those cards being out there will induce play actions to take account of them.

Looking forward to playing again. 

After a second very enjoyable play I'm inclined to remove the 'flies in the ointment' comment above. Once you know the powerful cards that are in the deck you do play to mitigate them. Also, although we didn't have a crises in our second game they very nearly struck and they did have a significant influence on play and I think that is the design intent - they are meant to 'influence' play not dominate it, but still have the outside chance of happening. Whether you house rule to make them more likely to happen is I think a matter of taste rather than a failing in the design.

2015-07-28 : Supreme layout. In essence you have a map with 8 or so locations but they've managed to package this into something which looks really nice on the table.
Gameplay is forgettable : buy soldiers & fleets, move them around, build factories, earn money, .. What kills it is that no matter how carefully you build your economic engine, the event phase at the end of a round will randomnly destroy a portion of it. Yuk. Lousiest Martin Wallace design ever.

A már-már szokásos, elemi akciós, kártyák, pörgős, ám mégis hosszabb Wallace játék. Engem leginkább a Discworldre emlékeztetett sci-fi köntösben. Egyszer nem volt rossz, de azért nem is mondanám tökéletesnek. A kártyák iszonyatosan szórnak: van 1 haderőt és van 5-ös is. wtf? Nagyon-nagyon kéne a játékba egy pontozó és egy bevétel track, mert ezt állandóan számolgatni rémálom. Ráadásul, mintha direkt kitolásra mentek volna, amikor ugyanolyanra csinálták az épületeket, mint a seregeket. Amúgy meg a szokásos többségi játék, annak minden áldásával, de nekem egyre inkább átkával együtt. 
Nagyon tetszett viszont a design, a háborúskodás kordában tartása a tension tokenekkel, nomeg persze a krízises mechanizmus. Mondjuk ehhez is jó lett volna minden bolygó mellé egy leírás, hogy nem kelljen állandóan az egyetlen segédletet nézegetnie mindenkinek.

Szóval vegyesek az érzelmek. Egyszer jó volt. Talán máskor is leülök mellé, de keresni nem fogom a lehetőséget. Akkor már sokkal inkább Discworld, Mythotopia,Study in Emerald, San mMarco.

-> 6.8

Area majority games aren't a favourite genre of mine to begin with. Coupled with directed player attacks and highly volatile action cards it is pretty clear that the game is not one I'm going to be overly fond of. And, in fact, I can easily see it come under criticism from the opposite end of the spectrum, too. While it's nice that the tension tiles make it possible to limit your exposure to enemy attacks somewhat they can just as easily turn the game into a static affair where no attacks are possible at all and it becomes a matter of scouring the galaxy for a few scrap victory points towards the end.

That the crises which make up a large part of the game's rules (which are really quite short and simple on the whole) have a very high probability of not impacting play at all is possibly just one of those Wallace idiosyncracies, but it certainly adds to the impression that the game could have done with a bit more development.

I'm finding that Martin Wallace makes great light games. They might not be gateway games, but games that could be someone's second or third game, and they're engaging enough to keep an experienced gamer's interest. They end up being some of the games I play the most.

Some people worry in the reviews that the events don't go off often enough to add interest to the game. That's not the case in my opinion. Martin Wallace designs black swan events into his games. There isn't always an alien invasion, but when it happens it certainly changes that game. It's fun to have a system where these events occur naturally instead of being set up from the beginning as particular scenarios. You might have a game where more than one goes off, or none, and each case will set a different tone for the rest of the game. In the case of no events also being a fun scenario, events only ever don't occur because either the players prevented them or because they totally fled the area as a matter of risk avoidance and got lucky that the event didn't go off. (Events have a chance of going off only where certain tiles are present, so you can see what areas are at risk with each game.) Both of those things shape the game almost as much as a robot rebellion. Almost!

I like how Martin Wallace divides some of his games up into distinct periods. This game has three eras just like Princes of the Renaissance does.  He does a different thing in Liberte and Discworld by having cards in an A deck come out before the cards in the B deck that add new dynamics to the game. 

The game can feel a little clunky toward the end when two main players are swinging their forces around to fight over the last remaining tension tile. Acquiring resources has a lot to do with timing, and the turns are pretty concrete (not a lot of bonus actions like in a Stefan Feld or Vital Lacerda game that can make some turns explode with activity and progress toward your goal), so the it can feel a little plodding at times. Be careful of that with new players. This gets more rough when you're doing a little counting at the game end to make sure you have the majority in the right areas to maximize your score. 

For some reason I love the pass mechanic that ends the round, the same as in Luna. It's almost a catch-up mechanic to ensure that no one can accomplish that much more than you when your forces are spent. You can also use it to add tension to the game and make people think twice about setting up a long play that will take multiple turns to accomplish.

Wallace dreht sich um und fliegt zurück in die Zukunft zu sich selbst, in einer Rakete von Jules Verne, in deren Kommandozentrale er das Alte neu erfindet. Der Schritt von EMERALD zu VENUS ist ein Schritt in die Old School, in der sich Eurogame, Konfliktstoff, kleine Kleinigkeiten und spielerische Ungerechtigkeit treffen. Zwischen Steampunk, Retro-SF und kindlicher Sehnsucht träumender Jungs ist das Fehlen jedweder Redaktion in diesem Fall eine kindliche Offenbarung. VENUS ist so herrlich einfach, dass es kracht im All. Was bei MYTHOTOPIA komplett in die Hose geht, fliegt hier in den Orbit. Unbedingt in der Limited Edition, in der die Farbenpracht der Holzfiguren einem nostalgischem Weltraumabenteuer den finalen Kick geben. OTV - again, again and again.

Towards the simpler end of the Wallace spectrum (perhaps Toledo weight?), the game is mainly the wonderful illustrations and backstory.  The crises add interest, but I wonder how often they come up?  Will be too random for some, but as long it is not played as a heavy analysis thinker should be fine at the correct gamelength.  Fun to play.

Fun game, particularly with 3+ players.  One thing I will say for this game is it seems to go a little short for me.  If I were to add any house rules I'd either add more starting cash or play for one more round, or more pass tokens per round, or the option of taking 1 or 2 coins instead of drawing a card with a pass token.

I would dearly love to see an expansion for this game.  Bring in other nations such as the Ottomans, Japanese, Chinese, or Zulus.  Also adding colonists to the mix might be good, a way for players to take a little more control, buying colonist units and placing them down on planets to increase their control.

Nothing special here, we've seen all of it.
Is that bad? No.. but, in this day & age, being mere mediocre doesn't really justify a buy. (unless you're a Wallace fan-boy i guess)

So you're left with a four player sci-fi game that feels a bit clunky at times.. there are all these special rules for every planet & not one came into effect.
You roll the "battle" dice & the result can swing incredibly wildly.
The cards are not balanced. Players can't attack each other unless fate put a tension marker on that particular planet.

With the exception of the title, this game does not come close to his other successes.

Whenever i play a Wallace game, i'm left with the feeling that he doesn't playtest his titles enough.

It doesn't really feel like a Martin Wallace game. For a start it's mediocre and he normally specialises in the brilliant and the terrible but never in between. Secondly it has no loans and is all about space

The different types of units are clever, the cards are ok, the economic model (with factories and mines) is ok... Generally speaking there is a lot that's ok but nothing that really wowed me

Next time I must remember that my Infantry are my most mobile resource, use them wisely!!

(03/04/2015) Comment based on one play.

Here is an interesting take on science-fiction, solar system area control, by Martin Wallace.

Although he is one of my favorite designers, this design doesn't excite me as much as Brass and London did, back in the day. There is an aspect of area control, driven my military considerations and card management, but that's about it--really nothing more than a number of pissing contests on each planet, with each player trying to control for end game VP. It is reminiscent of Perry Rhodan, in terms of the board setup, but with no pick-up and deliver. After awhile, the pissing contests get tiresome, and while the theme is somewhat immersive in the style of the 1930s Flash Gordon radio shows, there is no strategic/tactical/mechanical novelty to keep me interested. It is a stagnant "7".

Interesting twist on the area control genre where you build up forces, transport them around and seize control of mines and factories. I haven't read the comics on which it's based but it feels like a good fit to its theme, and I really enjoy the silly weapons and gadgets you can pick up.

There are complaints that could be made about the dice-rolling for claiming tiles but that's where the necessity of grabbing cards and building up your forces comes in. Still, some bad luck can cost you dearly without much scope for mitigation.

The crisis mechanic is also deliberately muted, and has never really affected any games I've played, but I know people have come up with a variant that involves rolling for each "planet" separately. I might try that in future for some real chaos.

EDIT: Sold simply because a couple of people in my gaming group dislike it.

Mixture of eurogame and ameritrash, our 5-player game lacked of crisis and more tensions to be funnier, more tenseness and interaction between players would be required.

After reading reviews I was not expecting much, but was very pleasantly surprised - it played three-player very well, the theme came through strongly and there was tension and difficult decisions, building up over the three rounds to a tightly fought finish.

Much faster and smoothly flowing than I thought it would be. The only thing that bothers me is that it's an area control game where you cannot know which areas you will be allowed to place into in a given round. That and some of the power cards makes this game a lot less strategic than it could have been. 

It's more of a fun romp with scoring than a serious competition. But the romp is fun enough and short enough that it's okay.

The artwork on the box and the cards is outstanding and got me interested although Wallace’s conflict titles usually aren’t for me. Actual gameplay was a surprise as I liked it. It’s a clear action selection structure, the mechanisms gel together well, the focus is mostly on tactical decisions, it’s a clear-cut game of majorities and most importantly, conflict is restricted by randomly placed tactical markers giving players the possibility to manage their exposure.

On the negative side, there’s no innovation of any type here. The crises which constitute a big part of the rules, potentially don’t play any relevant role in the game. The tile draw can decide the game when it doesn’t present any opportunity to challenge another player’s majority.

It’s still conflict, it’s still decided by luck but I would play again which is more than I can say for many other multiplayer conflict titles.

Competitive claim jumping along a largely linear map with minor snowballing and randomly appearing opportunities for player-vs-player attacks. In the end scores were much closer than I expected, but I still feel the combined randomness of dice and vastly unequal cards was a bit much; seeing someone play a +5 attack card to grab an additional mine at the end of the game after I'd been discarding a string of useless ones was wearying. Would like to play again though. Limited edition pieces are nice.

Surprisingly thematic game with space ships travelling from planet to planet dropping off units to fight on planets. Like many new Wallace games the whole thing feels "messy" in an ameritrash kind of a way, could've used losing a rule or two and lasts a bit too long. Other than that Onward to Venus is an ok game and I don't even mind the huge luck of the (card) draw. 

Played the version with wooden bits, would've preferred just normal cardboard tiles as they would've been way more practical.

Many things are done right here, the theme and especially graphics is great, the length is optimal. Unfortunately the cards aren't balanced at all: some of them are five times stronger/better than others and some of them are totally useless - that sucks because the cards are needed to play well. Other complain concerns the wooden units which comes with limited edition: those are easily mixed with each other. The one last BIG issue is the missing player aids - you'l need them for every player. So let's sum this up: well made area majority game with great graphics and right length, but some usability issues and luck of the draw.

Area control/majority control game where you are obtaining factories and mines to generate income and demonstrate economic control over planets.  You drop infantry, ships or tanks on to the planets to obtain tokens. Sometimes you have to attack the tokens.  Especially the mines.  You roll three dice and keep the highest and lowest roll.  The difference is added to the strength and if you can equal the value, you obtain the tile.  The same can be done with tension tiles.  

You play three rounds and at the end of three rounds there is a crisis.  Bad things can happen in a crisis.  In a five player game, I think it is hard to have a crisis that is bad for everyone.  Also, tension tiles are the way other players attack each other and there are very few of them.  In general, not a bad game, but not Wallace's best.

A lazy, banal design (it feels as a bad game from the '80s).

Randomness rules over everything (what you can do, how well you do it, etc.) and yet it doesn't last twenty minutes but a copule of hours.
The "twists" (crisis, pass) simply do not work.
Add gratuitous "take that" and fairly uneven cards to get a blatant failure.

Major disappointment (with no redeeming elements).

Maybe not Wallace's best game, but certainly playable. I am ok with the powerful cards and I like the dice rolls for setting combat strength, both of these can be planned for. I think the limited inter player conflict needs tweaking a bit and it seems hard to get crisis to take place on outer planets (perhaps we are playing it wrong) 

There isn't a lot of long term planning in the game. It is very tactical, as the tile draws essentially dictate what you need to do each round. 

Also, while the theme is cool, I find the game very mechanics driven. Apart from the deck, there is little flavor. I would have personally liked to see more of the flavor of the Graphic novels in the game play itself.

Initial rush for free factories / easy mines at the start of each round then mostly camping to victory.  Very reliant on useful tokens coming up.  Turn order crucial for grabbing easy factories / mines.  Big variability in usefulness in the cards makes for a lot of luck, and with the tokens appear for each planet. 

Suspect that the first player advantage would be lessened with fewer players.  First play was a long game that dragged big time (3 hours with 5 players).  Prone to AP particularly towards the end as the points can be so tight.  Too much luck for a game of this length. Can't recommend it for 5 players.

Easy game to teach, nice components in the limited edition. Interesting gameplay with the tiles dictating where you can attack. Crises are a little weak, we'll play with a variant from now on.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
To me this game feels very unfinished, it has the potential to be a good game, but it feels like it should have been given more development time, it feels rushed, as if Mr. Wallace was on high pressure to get it out into the market - taking his cash flow problems (see the Moongha project) this _may_ be indeed the case.

1) The crises do not work
In both my games none of the crises ever triggered. There are too few crises markers and too many player actions, so that crises were always removed or suppressed to levels on which they had no effect on a given planet. So you end up with a wonderfully designed crises catalogue, which is basically not used.

2) The pass mechanism has some troubles
The incentive to pass (get one card) is kinda nice, but in a five player game you really do NOT want to be the last player in a round as this bears a HUGE disadvantage. So when only two pass cubes are remaining there is a danger that players just move around with their ships to prevent drawing the second to last pass cube.

3) The last turn is HIGHLY anti-climatic. 
As soon as the mines and factories are claimed in the third turn, there is a lot of moving around and unit production just to get hold of the 1 VPs crisis tiles offer. So the game draaaaaaaaags on for just a couple of VPs which are compared peanuts to the VPs claimed via the planet control.

4) The cards are VERY unbalanced
Do not get me wrong - I do not mind the luck of the draw, but to me the range of usefulness the cards offer is way too wide.

5) The attack capabilities are too limited
Of course, in an "imperial-setting" space game I would like to be able to attack my opponent - even more so if he just attacked me - but guess what there is no tension tile on the planet with his unprotected mines and tons of my troops in orbit - so I can NOT attack???? Or this turn only one tension tile had been drawn, so only one player can attack - REALLY? To me this is - even given the more abstract/euro-y nature of the game - so anti-thematic that this alone is almost a game-breaker for me.

Beautiful components, at least the acrds and the planets.  Not super enthused by the wooden bits as they are hard to distinguish quickly.  Don't like being forced to act only in areas specified by the game.  Was hoping the events would have been more prominent and threatening.

Count me as one of the few who consider this a "thematic" rather than "strategy" game. Tons of randomness in the dice, cards, and tiles means you're mostly along for the ride, and a rather long one at that. The game seemed kind of intriguing at first, evoking its theme and possibly providing some interesting decisions, but it soon becomes clear that it's a repetitive and overly long affair. If you're into this theme, you might get more of a kick out of it, but typical Euro gamers will probably want to stay away.

In this game you are moving across the solar system from planet to planet building factories & mines for income and battling other players for planet dominance, bringing in "twist" cards to assist you. All of this works well but, and this is a planet sized BUT, the game is played over 3 rounds which are all very similar. So it feels like you are playing the same game 3 times! If you add in the long runtime (150 mins for 5 players, which is unlikely to reduce much in the future) you have a repetitive, and after the first hour, boring game. This is a shame as the underlying gameplay is sound.

My husband enjoyed this one more than I did.... To me it played a lot like Risk. It can have a very aggressive "take that" tone. I also felt that the game (at least when played two-player) can become unbalanced quickly and never recover. If one player takes an early lead, they will likely continue to lead. I believe the crisis events are meant to mitigate this aspect, but in our game they served more towards "nerfing" particular planets. 
In my opinion this just doesn't work as a two-player game, and would more realistically be labeled as 3-5.

I wonder if this game was tested at all. If so, it would be interesting to learn what the testers thought of an area control game where random tiles decide which areas you can take control of. Or a battle system where random dice determine whether you can spread your resources across several areas or get them engaged (or even destroyed) at one area only. Or a card system where random cards provide unbalanced abilities. Or a take that system where a single opponent action can deny you options for the rest of the round (in a game with only 3 rounds!). Indeed, I spent half the game just passing due to lack of action possibilities.

"Area control" game with great theme. The rules for the game are simple but it takes some time getting used to. 

Played with 4 players and it was very even do the game feels balanced.

The worst part of the game is the tension tiles. You can have a mine and a tension tile pops up. Either you bunker up which kind of defeats the whole "travel to other planets" idea or you take your loss and lose a factory/mine. 

The cards add a nice depth to the game and can be used for creative combos.

Overall it's a good game. I don't think it will hit the table frequently but I'm glad I got it.

Very, very clever Wallace design set in 1940s pulp sci-fi exploration and conquest.  Random bag pulls for critical resources/area control points will keep this game fresh for a long time, and the planetary crises can take on a "Republic of Rome" vibe as everyone can lose if the Earth or Moon get too overwhelmed.  I'm probably going to get this one... even though my gaming circle already has a copy.  It's that interesting.

I'm sad I missed out on the luxe version, but I'll be fine with cardboard tokens instead of mine meeples.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Very light, IMHO, much lighter than people says. It features no strategy, you just take best available tactic moves at your turn and some short term decisions (ending the phase with your units placed somewhere in order to attack/conquer something if you're lucky and you get the tiles you want where you want them in the next turn, etc).

The luck of the tiles draw is decisive. It defines where the PvP attacks will be, where the points can be taken, where the crisis will affect, etc.

And to add even more randomness, it uses a really variable combat resolution dice system, that can create huge ingame differences and that it is impossible to control. The points are given according to majorities, another mechanism I don't like because its flimsiness.

Its long, and it feels even longer. And to make matters even worse, the rules are not simple. You need to memorize what the crisis do in each planet depending on the level, etc.

I would be willing to take all "these troubles" for a great game, but game is nothing of that sort. It's a mediocre conquest/area control game with nothing new. It's not even thematic.

An area majority game, obscured by the means to get your cubes onto the areas. Being to build up your forces, move them around the planets, and roll dice to take over the mines and factories on the planets that award income there, most income gets the area majority points. There's a big card deck that helps with moving, die-rolling and everything else that happens in the game, so getting cards and taking advantage of them is a thing. Otherwise, it doesn't feel all that clever, just a long-ish game of accumulation, taking advantage of opportunities, hoping you roll well, and hitting the leader as and when you can - which is the crux of all area majority games after all. Nice rules, nice theme ... but area majority isn't that interesting a game mechanic these days.

After first try:

After going through the rules all of us felt like it's quite a simple game, but the complexity grew as we played. All in all we liked the mechanics, I especially liked the passing and turn end function, but it had a minor flaw. To avoid becoming last player you could always move a spare rocket back and forth between planets instead of passing. If everyone does that, the turn will never end. 

We also felt that the end of last round became a bit silly, since everyone threw what they had against the last few almost impossible crises tiles instead of passing and ending the game, thus prolonging the last round unessesary.

I've played this twice now, first time in the Oxford boardgames cafe, where I and my stepnephew picked up the rules and got it finished in 90mins, and had a lot of fun along the way. So I rushed out and bought a copy and played it again a week later with my son, and again had a lot of fun. Great steampunk atmosphere, interesting gameplay, lovely to look at, instantly likeable. At £25 it's also a bargain.

Great area control game - the card deck is what makes this game shine with lot of variablity and great artwork. Getting mines, factories and free card draws in the begginning and/or middle of the game and then later keeping control of the areas and finding the last possible points versus opponents leads to a very tense game from beginning to end.

Terrific space combat and logistics game with riotous art and hilarious names for rayguns, spaceships, and the characters who employ them.

Had some high expectations of this one, but my 1 play so far was a bit disappointing. The game has for me the same randomness as 'The Witches: A Discworld Game', but were that game is a light family game with a nice short playing time, it doesn't bother me, while this one is longer and tries to be more, I think?

The most random thing that bothers me the most is the outcome of the tiles. Let's say you want to take over a majority of someone, if there doesn't appear a mine or a tension-tile, you just won't be able to do that.

Some similarity with Struggle of Empires and Aeroplanes. 

Not worth playing 2 player. 4 seems ideal. 

Really cool components, and absolutely amazing art. Game play is quite good -- standard Martin Wallace fare -- and it reminds me of 'Struggle of Empires' (which is an amazing game) and 'Aeroplanes'. There are a lot of tiles, though. Which can make the game quite random. As a result, it might be come hard or impossible to pull in the runaway leader.

This is a very curious area control game. The idea is, at the end of three rounds, have the highest money production on as many planets as you can, with some points for second and third places. In order for you to get these production buildings, you have to be first to reach and sometimes fight the randomly drawn token that allows you to place the piece. This leads to some strangeness, for example a planet might never get more than one token that allows building. Additionally, some of the randomly drawn tokens can cause a crisis, which is a negative event if it isn't dealt with via military strength. There is also a tile that lets you conquer an opponent's building. Overall the game is interesting because it can get quirky.

Very thematic and good looking game by Martin Wallace, which feels much more like A Study in Emerald than his train games.

The scoring mechanism of the game is area majority and you have a very easy economic component. Many actions like building mines or resolving conflicts require dice rolling  with outcome uncertainty. Many actions can be supported by playing cards, which vary greatly in effectivity. In each round you also have the randomness that random tiles dictate which actions can be taken on the different planets. 

In its core, OtV is an Ameritrash game. There is a lot of randomness, there are some "take-that"-cards which let you target specific players, and there are also limited oppurtunities to attack other players. For my taste the game takes a bit too long and requires too much thinking for its randomness. 

The components (I played the limited edition with wooden pieces) are very good and the artwork on the cards is great. However, there are two points that bug me: First, as usual for Martin Wallace games, blue and purple are quite hard to tell apart. Second, infantry is represented by a token resembling a laser pistol. When it tips to its end, it pretty much looks like the tanks. So you have to look quite carefully to assess the strength of a player's military force on one planet. I am really puzzled why Martin Wallace (or the  people he works with) still do such basic mistakes. It is not as if there are no meeples available for infantry...

The cards are quite amusing. I'm still getting used to the game play, and I need to try this with more players. Like other players, I find the crises hardly ever happen.

Upon reading the rules, one's immediate reaction is "only three turns?"  Typical of Wallace though, one can take a great number though not unlimited number of actions on a turn, so the game really is longer than one might think.  And the play time feels just about right in terms of building up some income and military units, then using those units to claim income and victory points.

The cards add a nice mix and the tiles on the planets add replay value.  The crisis cards aren't a key part of the game, but add enough of a distraction that one might need to pay attention to minimize their potential damage (though in many games they can be safely ignored.)

Having now done a solo run-through, I can see why this gets mediocre reviews.  The biggest issue, I think, is time.  If this game lasted 60 min or less, I think it would be a fair bit of fun and people would be more willing to roll with the randomness and cardplay.  But it's a bit too samey and dull for 90-120 min.  Not a true wargame, since attacking your opponents can only happen when conflict tiles are in play.  Mostly a tactical maneuvering game, without too much emotional payoff.  I quite like the theme and aesthetic and wish this was closer to a 60 min free-for-all romp in space than what it is.

RATING: 4
Semi-cooperative abstract area majority game that feels most like Martin Wallace's earlier Ankh-Morpork: play proceeds through amusing, thematic, swingy cards, best enjoyed for the flavour. Players use their ships, infantry and tanks to claim objective tiles on the surface of each planet, for instant benefits (e.g. draw cards) or ongoing ones (factories and mines provide income; majority scoring is based on highest income).

Each of these planets/territories can suffer a different "crisis"; these appear like other objective tiles and trigger if not defeated. Earth can have a robot rebellion (all players lose); an alien invasion starts in the Kuiper Belt (if it reaches Earth, all players lose). Other planets have more localized disasters: the Venusian rebellion, for example, essentially just removes Venus from the game.

This is all fun in theory, but it's highly random. In addition to the possible wild swings in defense values based on dice (does that mine have defense 1 or 7?), many cards are strictly superior to others (moon laser worth 5 combat points vs handgun worth 1), and the objective tile distribution can be grotesquely unbalanced. For example, it's entirely possible for a planet to never be able to produce any income at all. In other cases, free factories can rain like mana from heaven on one player while tension tiles (it is only possible to attack other players if these appear) threaten others.

All that is to say, I'm not convinced of its merits as a strategy game. Unlike Ankh-Morpork, I don't believe it's fun enough to play regardless.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
4 seems a little harsh, but I think I'd actively resist playing it again, so I don't see how I can rate it much higher.  The game plays at a reasonable pace, and the area control mechanic works fine, but there are massive swings of luck all over the place.  What tiles appear on what worlds, how well you roll the dice, and whether you get good cards are all going to be more important than what you actually do.  The power level difference in the cards I found to be especially galling.  I'm almost positive I completely hate how ties work for area majority as well.  

Also, going earlier is clearly amazing, and it is mostly out of your control.  It is often especially important to resolve the tension tiles in your favor, and there isn't really much your opponents can do about it.  If you get to go earlier in the round, and a tension tile happens to appear where you want it to, you get their mine or factory.  There are only so many free factories as well, and going earlier can guarantee you them, and they are much better than anything else.  

Then there are the crisis tokens. The idea is that you need to get them in order for terrible things not to happen, but in practice, like in many competitive co-op scenarios, the player who ignores them will probably do better, because 1 point is godawful.  I generally find that games that encourage players to leverage a game loss state are not for me.

It's not a terrible game, and I should probably redo my ratings of other games to reflect where this game truly lies for me, but I'm not interested in playing it again.  There are dozens of better area control games out there.

Looks good, thematic sense is really dripping through in the card deck.

However, due to the random nature of the tile drawing for which you hunt every turn, there is almost no planning ahead to be done. 

Result is a highly tactical game that boils down to the opportunistic 'what is the best quick win I can get in my turn'. 

Couple that with the fact that actions themselves are very simple, and you simply have not a very interesting game. Shame, as the setting and art deserve way more.

Light and highly tactical. No strategy and some gamey mechanics. Not something I would seek out again.

Gets a bonus point for the setting.

tl;dr: good but not for me

Onward to Venus uses artwork from a Weta Workshop artist and combines that with what is essentially an area majority game. The majorities are counted in production capacity (mines and factories) which, on top of giving you majorities, also give you income and production capacity.
Martin Wallace is really good at using familiar elements and whipping them together into a new, fresh design that works great. This one doesn't feel as original as some of his other titles, but it still works very well. The game is clearly well developed and has a very appropriate length. There also is an appropriate amount of luck in the cards.
I liked the game enough to play it again, but it's not a design I love or one that I expect to love in the future. It's not exactly the kind of game that our group prefers. While the design is well developed, the combination of the luck with some direct player conflict is not what my group prefers.

I will be the first to admit that I might not rate this game as highly if it had a different theme.

But it doesn't. It has this one, and I love it.

I do wish the crises and tension came more often. I think it could make for a better game.

Also, it plays quite differently with different numbers of players. With two, it feels more like a sandbox. With more, it starts to feel cutthroat. I like it both ways.

Fun game, but be prepared for a major time commitment, perhaps as much as an hour per player.

It's a very solid game. Very random, but tolerable since the rules are very simple and the game plays quickly.

(Feb 2015 after 1 3p learning game) - Went into this one cold knowing nothing about it, but I'll try most Martin Wallace titles.   After a few rounds and seeing how things resolve, the pace of the game was very nice.  The "pimped out" wooden bits are really nice and this might be my favorite space exploration game.   Will play again.

Excellent at being what it is, namely a silly lightweight area control game, with a cool theme. 

The beauty of Onward to Venus is its simplicity. I've taught this to two newbie gamers (previous gaming Ticket to Ride) and they were immediately competitive. Yet, while we prefer heavier games, we're happy to see this hit the table with two. It's fun, it's smooth and it plays with little downtime. 

With two players, crises routine blow up and it turns into a light semi-coop with negotiation. With five players, someone deals with the crises and it's straight area-control and take-that.

Initially (7):

Interesting area control game. Quite a bit of randomness, though, with random tiles for available actions/resources, random card draws which vary vastly in power, and random dice roll defence values for mines/crisis/tension tiles.

-----

Revisited (4):

This should easily be an 8 - great theme, interesting and fun to play, but it is just soooooo random that it barely qualifies as a game but merely an activity. You would think this is a Kickstarter game by a first-time designer who have not even played any modern games - not by an experienced top designer. Randomness upon randomness upon randomness.

Completely random tile draw which totally determines what actions can be taken and where. First players in turn-order may practically get valuable freebies while later players may be left with secondary tat and (initially) impossible to defeat targets. Initial freebies may even end up undisputed for the rest of the game and be worth lots of victory points. Some cool, fun, alien invasion events can occur - but probably not. You may just as well skip the rules reading/explanation of those until it may become relevant.

Why, why, why are the tiles just one big random pile and not 'seeded' with a specific set of tiles for each of the three rounds ensuring a more balanced distribution and some kind of progression from round to round?

Completely random card draw which significantly determines who gets to take the different random tile determined possible actions. Wildly unbalanced cards with some being mostly useless and other cards/combinations being game changing/winning.

Why, why, why are there not for example a number of face up cards to choose from instead of just blindly drawing random cards - you know, *shock* *horror* meaningful decision making instead of complete randomness; and given the very unbalanced cards why is there no action to churn through the deck to dig for something you want or at least is useful for you - for example just a choice of discarding and redrawing any number of cards when passing instead of just drawing one random card?

Very random combat with completely random addition of 0-6 defence strength to base strength of typically 3 (1-5) - additionally up to three attacking units may completely randomly be killed. The dice rolling even maximizes the randomness/unfairness by rolling 3 dice, ignoring the middle value, using the difference between the highest and lowest values, resulting in mostly very high 5-6 results but occasionally, completely randomly low giveaways.

Why, why, why not just roll 2 dice resulting in more balanced/fair normal distribution; and why completely randomly destroy three attacking units on top of a tough/failed attack, not just wasting the player's turn but possibly, practically taking the player completely out of the game instead of making the random casualties, casualties of success (a low dice roll and probably victory)?

I will probably never play this again - at least not using the official rules; and I cannot be bothered to try to fix any game with various houserules, so unless someone else can be bothered to come up with a solid set of houserules, it is Goodbye To Venus.

This game is tough to categorize. It's sort of a worker placement game, but one in which the spaces always change function from turn to turn, as do the placement costs. It's also an area control game, but one in which you can't really pick your battles. Only mining and factory assets determine control, but their appearance is random. The game dictates where the conflict zones will be, not the players. In other words, it does almost everything wrong.

Yet the game is fun. Bucking traditional wisdom makes the game feel remarkably fresh. The art is stunning and the comedic and biting satire of the Imperial British Empire is spot on, making every card draw a chuckle worthy event (particularly the named equipment).

It's not going to be for everyone. The arc of the game is somewhat random. It's tough to target the leader in any meaningful way and often times there is no way to put important control points down where they are needed. The result is an almost entirely tactical puzzle. Again, this is going to be a point of contention for a whole lot of people.

It's fun though, which sort of trumps all that stuff. It plays fairly quickly too, with very little down time between turns. That makes it almost a filler, although the length is a hair long for that. Still, it fills the role wonderfully if you have the time for it.

This game it´s a lot of fun.

In essence its an area control, but the mechanics and the tension it delivers keeps everyboy engaged.

The use of cards make the turns go quick, and the crisis tiles are a very nice touch (maybe you can use some house rules to make the crisis tiles more likely to happen).

Also the design of this game its awesome, the board are planets (literally round pieces of cardstock) and the art is very cool and different.

The only cons its the playtime with 5 players its long!

Played once with 5 players. Area control game where building the most structures on planets is the thing to go for.  A game where players get 1 action plus potential card actions.  Some actions like combat use 3 dice with a potential to destroy your armaments.

I found the game to be pretty boring and luck heavy, take 1 action then wait forever to get your action again; can hardly plan much beyond this and next round.

Players on opposite sides of the map never interact.

Not worth replaying.

This was about as interesting as chewing a mouthful of sand. It looks quite nice. Looks can be deceiving. There is literally nothing exciting about this game. You have turns where there is just nothing of value to do, but you have all these spaceships and you're not allowed to attack anyone. Do 1 thing, pass. Do 1 thing, pass. Ugh, total disappointment, I was actually really looking forward to this. Anyone want to trade for it? It's really good I promise.

RATING: 7
Fzzt turned out to be a very pleasant and fun discovery (I had never heard of it before).

This relatively short game (30 minutes) is driven by several rounds of blind bidding for cards that you subsequently use to: build your deck, bid in the short and medium term, and earn victory points at the end.

This game is a really good filler. Check it out.

RATING: 6
Really impressed with this card game which offers a lot of meat for such a small package.  Plays better with more players but is still fun with 2; and plays fast no matter how many are playing.  The cards feature silly yet useful art in clearly explaining what they offer to players.  Overall an excellent card filler whose easy to understand rules and gameplay still offer players a lot of thoughtful decisions to make through each auction/ round.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This game is a little gem and could become the quick card game of choice.  Players bid for robots.  Robots fill your hand as in Dominion, but there is an element of hand management as you can discard robots onto any production units you have acquired as long as there are matching symbols.  Lots to think about.  Nice graphics but the card symbols and rules text could have been larger.  Recommended.

UPDATE 3/11/2014: This is still a good game, but I have had a lot better deck builder experiences since playing this so I feel inclined to lower my rating.  It still gets the major award for being a good deck builder in a small package though.

This is an excellent deck builder in a tiny package. If you wanted a good deck builder that could just about fit in your pocket, this is it. As an extra bonus, it is a lot of fun.

RATING: 5.5
Single deck of cards allegedly very similar to dominion in mechanic. There doesn't seem to be much room for applied skill, the turn over of cards on the conveyor belt need some coin flip decisions as to whether to go for the open batch or wait on the off chance that something better will come.

Left unimpressed and unlikely to play again.

You know, I enjoyed our first play. But we got one important rule wrong: we did a final auction of 6 cards when we weren't supposed to. Also, neither of us paid any attention to the symbols we were purchasing, leading to many negative points from incomplete widgets.

I appreciated that the game is quick, actually pretty simple, and combines auctions with set collection in a nifty way.

Short robot game, with comparisons made to Dominion.  First impression is that that shouldn't put you off.  I enjoyed it, though I need to play more to say much more than that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A pretty cool little bidding/deck building/set collection game where the cards are multi-purpose, serving both to score you points as well as act as cards to bid with.  You'll want to balance your deck to ensure that you can get cards with reasonable bidding strengths, while also obtaining cards that can score you points.

Additionally, you'll also obtain order cards which require certain symbols.  Each of your cards also contains one or more symbols to fulfill these.  So, you must pay attention to this along with the bidding strengths and point values.

The main drawback to me is all of the blind-bidding, as I'm not a huge fan of blind bids.  Other than that, a pretty cool game!

My son enjoys this for the theme (anything with robots will capture his attention, and it doesn't hurt that he's won the first 2 games).  After playing a few games now, I enjoy this as well.  Has a bit of a Dominion feel (on a smaller scale), but with bidding added.

This game is a great gateway! Your buying cards (robots) which give  you more power, points and tools. You use the power to buy more robots, the points to win the game and the tools to build extra victory points. Each round you only draw up to 6 cards so in a way it has a slight dominion feel. 

I also love the conveyor belt! Depending on the first card you will be able to see 1-8 cards coming up. Some of the cards are negative points and as you get down to the last few cards if they are still hidden you start to worry it's negative points. You then throw all your cards in to make sure you won't take those last few cards and it turns out it's a really awesome robot (or it's a negative card, whew)! 

Would recommend this game. Deck Management, Auctions and set collection = Awesome! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game has definite potential and I will all my rating preliminary because I suspect it's just one that should list 2 players as an option. It was pretty obvious that the bidding element needs more players to keep things interesting.

I did enjoy having various widgets I was trying to fulfill and thinking hard about which cards to assign to each one to maximize my points. There's a good game hidden in here, I just need more plays with more players to get to it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Components: Fun illustrations. Good iconography, though the icons and points could be larger.

Experience: I don't get it. I bid blindly for a card, often winning it (and therefore losing a bidding card) even when I didn't intend to. I sometimes end up taking more production cards than I want to.

I made the mistake of thinking that I wanted to cull my hand, placing my low-energy cards out of play onto my production cards. But this severely hampered my ability to lose at auctions. Ideally, a hand will have a little of everything for maximum flexibility.

Still, it's just lots and lots of blind bidding over and over again, and then suddenly there's a winner.

I need to play this more. A neat auction game where the cards you have are your money, but they are also used to build end of game scoring machines.

I like how players don't see everything that will be auctioned at once (usually). That not knowing makes bidding that much more interesting.

RATING: N/A
Revisit impression. I wish the deck building mechanic was on the heavier side. In our 4-player game, no player had the issue of running out of cards, so we never reshuffle our hand to draw a new 6 cards (except for the end of the round). Maybe it's because we were not vicious enough in bidding.

(As of [b]1[/b] play) This needs more plays before I render a final judgement. The combination of blind bidding, deck building and set collection is interesting, and works relatively well, although, as of yet, this does not appear to be a potential show-stopper.

RATING: 7.5
A clever filler with a fun theme that combines mechanics of auctions, and set-collection, and deck-building.  The deck-building is like Dominion boiled down to its simplest form, but the auctions and theme mean that these 60 cards offer a lot of game in an attractive small package.  Now part of the Gryphon Games tin box series.

Nice little bidding/deck building game.

Robots are you bidding power and also required for the construction of 'widgets' for bonus points this allows you to remove unwanted cards i.e. robots with low bidding value from your deck and still score for them.

The only things I dislike about this are the non-variable first player and that first player always breaks ties.

Can also be a little over long as you play through the whole deck... but generally makes for a close game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Again with the teeny tiny symbols! What's wrong with you people, why can't you just make symbols and numbers large enough to see without using a magnifying glass?

I liked this game as far as it went. The deck building is very like Dominion, but the hand limiting and the Production Units seemed sufficiently original though. I was bothered that an early lead would translate into a run-away leader, since winning good cards in the auction means you have a better hand next turn. I'd have to play it a few times, but after one play I suspect that's an issue.

I think the Production Units is a good idea, and one other game designers will want to copy. It certainly seems to be the idea to spin off into other games as a good scoring mechanism.

The graphic design was good (apart from the teeny tiny symbols). There's some text on the cards to name the robots, but this is illegible.

A light blind bidding set collection game. It works well enough as a filler but I'm doubtful of its staying power since it's fairly same-y all along.

A neat little drafting/auction/deckbuilder for families and kids.

I thought it was too short, so I bought the expansion just to allow four players to play an extra round.  We'll see how that affects things.

That was the only bad thing, really--the "blink and you miss it" syndrome.  I liked the bidding and the simple take on deckbuilding, though.

Like many people who enjoy this game, I was first suspicious that it would be a sort of brain-dead auction game, given the recycled auction and deck-builder mechanics from many popular games. However, Boydell managed to create a very enjoyable filler! It's nice to have an auction game that works well with 2 players (not always easy to find). The enjoyment comes out of trying to guess your opponents' bids and also there is a little bluffing as there might be some good cards out there that you want to avoid in order to hold on to your "power cards" for a later, more impressive bid. The bonus point cards are great if you can complete them, but again, you might try to hold off to avoid possible negative points for uncompleted bonus cards at the end of the game. It's actually quite interesting how Boydell has taken extremely familiar mechanics and made an auction card game that feels fresh. Impressive! Plus, if you're a fan of robots, the decoration is nice. (I think it's a stretch to call it a "theme".)

Gave this away as an early Christmas present, then got to play it once as well.

This quick little deck-builder forces some bid control, to ensure maximum use of production cards, and to capture needed resources.

It's clever, attractive, small, nicely boxed, and plays up to 6 with the expansion set.

Card based auction game. Cards are bidding currency, VP and as raw ingredients for making robots (worth more VP). You bid on more cards, most are like the ones you start with and a few are robot factories. There is an interesting issue that you end up bidding more for cards than they are worth at face value. Some of us figured this out faster than others.

The theme is unique, which is something that I also really appreciate - it's fun to imagine the conveyor belt, and the illustrations help evoke part of that theme.

- A few interesting situations arose from the simple rules (being out of cards, bidding with the whole hand, judging the pace of the game and how many production units to get, bluffing,â¦).

* Rulebook and rules

The rulebook is really not very good: important points are not emphasized. It is almost necessary to read whole paragraphs before finding the information one is looking for.

The rules were also not very clear about which cards to include in the deck: I mistakenly put the start cards of player 4 (except for the mechanics, which is explicitly excluded from the game).

Using the cards in your hand you bid. Cards won become part of your deck. Eight cards are auctioned a round. You start each round with 6 cards. you do not get more cards unless all players run out, in which case discards and remaining deck are reshuffled and hands are refilled to 6 (I haven't seen this yet). 

It's a minor deck building element coupled with auction and set collection for end game bonuses. 

It's fast, it's easy, and it's quite fun. Totally unique as a filler in its' style and implementation of its' mechanics.

A simple set collection game where you can use cards to make sets or they have a "money" value.  The game has a simple auction to acquire additional cards.  It is a very light game and a ok filler.  It can run long if players take too long on the auction and agonize over decisions.  It should only take 30 min at most to play.  

It is an ok game.

I think there's a fun game here, but it has to claw its way past the too-small, poorly written rulebook and the terrible graphic design of the cards themselves (let's make all the important elements tiny, and similar in color, and hard to read!). The art is nice, and the core of the game is enjoyable.

One play wasn't enough to be sure about it, but it was all we had the patience for the first time out. Then it sat for months and I didn't miss it, so I gave it away.

RATING: 6.5
I really like the clever blending of mechanics (drafting, auctioning, set collection and deck building) in this game. To me, it can be a real brain-burner. In fact, this is one of my worst games for AP. I feel like you have to consider each action/bid very carefully, because it has a tremendous effect on so many other parts of the game. One criticism is that this game can be anti-climatic near the end with 2. It usually comes down to who has the best card draw last. It's probably not best with 2. My guess would be that 4 is the sweet spot. Either way, an excellent game, to be sure. The closest comparison I can make for this game is Biblios, and while for me, it's not quite that elegant, it's still a solid, fun auction game that plays well for 2+.

First impression (4 players) : A short blindbidding auction game. You try to gain robots, that both enable you to bid higher/more and score points, and special scoring cards that give you extra points for certain robot combinations. There is a bit of rich-get-richer problem if someone gets too good start and because some of the rounds cards are revealed only later you might be screwed because of them in way or another.

Fun little auction game which wins credibility points with its good humour and strong theme. A great filler or one to introduce to the folks, but certainly not a game without a modicum of strategy, thanks to the deck-recycling policy. A shame it appears to be jumping on an unwarranted Dominion bandwagon, though this is no fault of the design.

Very Cool! Underrated! Want to play this more! A mini deck-building game with auctions. Can be quick and fun! A bit mathy, but that and the fun artwork (complete with sci-fi easter eggs) is what makes this different from a mindless-light-filler-type game.

Fun art, and great tribute to Sci-Fi robots!!!!!

RATING: 6
A nice auction filler without "take that" play. 2p and 4p learning games each took 30-40 minutes. I definitely like it better with 4 than with 2.

With 2p, the ability to go all-in, and then having both players re-draw when their cards are exhausted feels awkward, I wonder if it would be better to say that any cards remaining on the conveyor belt when both players run out of cards simply get discarded. Deck-thinning is far more important with 2p than with 4.

The BGG weight of 1.7 seems about right. It's a light but non-trivial card game, with a touch of rules complexity, and (apparently) some depth of play.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like that allocating cards to production units lets you get your lower powered cards out of hand management. When you shuffle for next round- you should be getting a more powerful hand this way.

I painted a small spanner for the game marker (in box).

I screwed a few rules up first game

-After a tied auction- spanner rotates to left of winner.
-Cards allocated to production units are NOT tied to a specific resource (like oil). You get to decide at game end.

Based on one play: A simple auction game where you try to collect cards to use in your deck and to complete the construction of some projects. Light, but has some nice strategic options in keeping cards in your deck or placing them on your projects. some luck, but a nice filler with a fair amount of thought involved.

Fzzzt! is a nice little auction/set-collection filler. Cards serve multiple purposes: money for bidding, straight victory points, and components in sets that score more points. The blind bidding, which I don't usually like, works well and the passing of the 'spanner' to the loser of a tie is a really nice mechanic (pun intended) that can put players in an unexpectedly sticky spot.

RATING: 6.7
Pros:
* Quick setup
* Worked well for 2
* Tough decisions with lots of bluffing and doublethink style interaction.

Cons:
* Aside from the power of the cards, it's hard to get an idea how much a card is worth to someone.
* I quite dislike blind auctions.
* At least in a 2p game, it's a bit too easy to run out of cards, leaving your opponent to clean up. This can also be a good strategy, but it's teetering on the edge of too random/chaotic.

Overall Impression:
* Would recommend. One of the better pure card games.

= 2014-04-20

Putting this on the trade list. I'm not fond of blind auctions and I feel Puzzle Strike fills the deck builder slot well enough.

= 2013-11-11

Played one game with my brother. I ran out of cards during one round and when the next set of cards was flipped over, three of them were assembly units. This resulted in my brother having 6 assembly units for most of the game and me only having 2. I never managed to get an extra one so I wasn't able to clean my deck as well as he could. He just barely managed to finish all of them and won the game by 1 point. Not bad. This was a learning game so it was interesting to see two very different (however accidental) stategies result in such close scores.

Only played with 2 so far- I'm really hoping that this game shines with more players, because it felt somewhat flat on our first play.  Not writing it off yet though...

Initially it looks like this is based on dominion but you soon realize this is just an auction game. You use robots in your hand to bid for more robots. You do this over several rounds and score up points, essentially based on your robots or combinations of robots.

This is essentially a set-collecting auction game, with a nice trade-off between effective bidding power versus end-game bonuses (simply buying "the best" robots each round is often not good enough to win at the end.)

RATING: 5
I'm not a big fan of blind bidding games, although there are exceptions to the rule. Fzzzt! [i]isn't[/i] an exception. Players bid for robot cards which serve dual roles as currency for later rounds, and points at the end. Used cards are placed in a discard pile, then drawn back periodically in a rudimentary deckbuilding system. 

The lack of variation in auction conditions, coupled with the difficulty in gauging how your opponents value a particular card, make the auctions blur past by you. The result is a rather repetitive game, and its drawbacks are amplified when playing with fewer players. It's not a terrible game per se, but easily outclassed in its own genre by titles such as [thing=1403][/thing].

I love robots, card games and bidding games. So what's not to like? Looks like my dislike for deckbuilding games in general made this game merely fizzzle in my experience. I last played a few months ago but remember that in one two player game the game even seemed broken. I can no longer recall the details but I think I was able to give my opponent the bad cards and keep the good cards for myself on every single turn, while the opponent had no way to recover from the situation. We even tried to figure out if there was anything he could do and went over the rules once again, but we hadn't missed any rules and yet could not find a solution to his situation. I guess this game is OK for a light filler, it is compact, the robots look nice and the rules are fairly simple, but if you have better games, just stick with the better ones.

I didn't like the game. I played basically to get high VP's cards no matter the symbols I got. In the end it all turned out to work pretty fine with me winning the game by a good margin. It didn't help the thinking or the planning of the other players because I just had enough luck to have the right cards to bid for the right options. So, almost everything on this game, at least for me, was pure randomness. 

I didn't even like the idea, the concept or the theme of the game. It's a basic bidding game with lots of random factors.

RATING: 7
[Surprised Stare Games 09 edition w/ the Chief Mechanic bug] {Robot; blind-bidding, hand-management, deck-building; scalable} Fzzzt! is an interesting filler.  It is thematic, interactive and fun (due to the blind bidding).  A typical game runs around 30 minutes.  Replayability is so-so.  It's very suitable for occasionally play and travels.

The deck-building mechanic is similar to Dominion but building a good deck is not as important as in Dominion because the cards in hand are only useful for bidding.  And, it is easier to build a deck because there are not too many cards to collect and players only need to trivially keep the cards with higher power (i.e. discarding those low ones to the production lines - the only tricky part is players have to take risk that they don't have enough robot cards for higher-value production lines).  Since players can easily acquire cards in a round, competition of cards is not as strong as I expected; as a result, the game is not tense enough.

The cards are colorful and nicely illustrated. The icons are effective. It'd be better if they include a programming language as well for the 4th mechanics.

Robotic cards as money & VP. Each round, 8 cards will be individually auctioned in a semi-revealed series, and you have 7 cards to bid with. Winning bids & cards only 'lost' till next round. Most cards earn VP directly, some offer opportunities to combine components from other cards to earn bonus VP. Plays smoothly & quickly, and each player start to value cards differently as bonus possibilities start to differ. To be released at UK Games Expo, where I'll pick up a copy.

One of my favourite shorter (under an hour) games ever. The mechanics boil down the deck-building game to its essential elements, without over-simplifying them. I've successfully taught the game to several non-gamers, and converted a couple of them into gamers in the process. The theme is fantastic, the artwork is wacky and wonderful, and the geek humour is spot on. Fzzzt! is, in my opinion, a criminally underrated game, and is undoubtedly the most fun you can have with a spanner with your clothes on.

Update: I still like it, but it just didn't make the cut when compared to other light card games that I have.

Sold.

Fairly light, fast-playing bidding game. Intitial impression: a 6, but could go up a point with more play. My wife and mother-in-law both enjoyed it. Definitely well play-tested- all the kinks have been worked out. I'll give it at least one more play.

Its broken. Once the highest robot is gone that person has already won.

Quite enjoyable little auction filler game.

One of the few auction games that I feel works with 2 players.

Decent mechanisms, but the auction is undesirable blind bidding, the draft pool is quite random, and the deckbuilding aspect is quite diluted. Not bad but could be much better.

Inoffensive cardgame which combines blind bidding, bluffing, set collection and a tiny little bit of deck-building somewhat successfully. I do not normally like the blind bidding mechanic, but there are still some worthwile decisions to be made with regard to which cards to keep in your deck (you do not necessarily want to retain the high ones) and which to place under your bonus cards each round. As such, it plays OK as a filler.

Nice ideas. There are some things that I don't like though. It is very difficult to try to see what robots (parts) you need, for example.

some of the interesting parts of the decisions you make in this game are essentially not present (set collection and blocking set collection, as well as subtleties of when and how much to bid) when playing with 2 players,  so I highly recommend playing with 3 or 4.

that's not to say that it becomes bad at 2, just that it becomes much lighter overall... and it starts out very light to begin with.

Fun filler. Only played once yet so we might have interpreted some rules wrongly. Can we play as many cards as we like for production in the end?
Anyway, we had fun and this is a great filler.

Update 2017: Since it didn't got played in the past 7 years I gave it to a friend, hope she'll like it!

[q="tonyboydell"]Although you are restricted in playing one robot into each PU _during_ the game, at the end of the game you can put in as many robots to PUs to make up the rest of your sets.

'During' the game helps with hand-trimming! You _still_ get to use all of the robots you can at the end![/q]

Fzzst is an auction game, with a simple deck building element in it. Each round 8 cards are up for auction. Players bid with their hand of cards and win more cards. Some cards are Production Units, which require other cards to be assigned to them by game end in order to generate points (each robot card has some symbols on it, Cogs, Oil, Wrench, etc). At the end of each round, you may assign some of your robot cards to your Production Units, which helps you thin your deck and improve your chances of drawing high value cards to bid with in the next round. Or, you can assign them at game end for maximum efficiency, but that makes your draws for bidding each round more likely to have less valuable cards in it.

It's a short simple game, but it hits the mark it's aiming at quite well, I think.

11/10 - After 1 5p game.   A card game where you simultaneously bid on cards which lay out the items needed for construction/fulfillment, or have items on them, or can be used for currency in bidding.  I like the 12 cards per round element and sometimes being able to se what is coming down the line.  Would play again, no need to own it since I have so many unplayed card games.

actually wouldn't mind playing this some more. the game play mechanisms seem very fleshed out for the size of this game. reminds me a little of z-man games.

Fzzzt! has only a very basic similarity to other deck-builders, but you are building up and optimizing a deck of cards through the main mechanisms in the game, so it's technically a part of the genre.  The game, though, is really a set collection game where you bid for cards you want with cards out of hand.  The cards do multiple things -- they can be used for bidding or go toward making widgets on your production line -- and you can cull them from your deck by adding them to your production lines between turns.  It's a nifty little game that can still be prone to being a little luck-heavy through the cards that come out on the conveyor belt, but it's different enough to be interesting in its own right.

Such a big game in such a small package! Got it on the spur of the moment at Essen 09 on the recommendation of a friend. At first I wasn't that keen on it, as the game will punish you for simple mistakes, and has a nasty start player bonus/penalty. Now, however, I love it! This game will definately teach you how to auction.

Sci-fi bid auction card game for robots and production units to build sets. Pass the wrench for bid starter.  Fun art. Not all cards are good and leads to auction timing strategy.

Yet another worker placement game, with this one having a "bumping" mechanic similar but more forgiving than Carson City, and a laws phase similar to Cuba.

During a set number of rounds (5) you want to score the most points.  You own a meagre castle and you travel the lands fighting for nobles and protecting their castles and fighting the marauding French.  The mechanic is worker placement, with the twists being that you have differing powered workers (more prestigious knights) and these more powerful knights can access castles that weaker ones cannot and they can also bump out weaker knights from a location.  Squires are a form of currency, as they are weaker temporary workers that can boost your conquering power in a castle but after they're a once use only when you choose to use them.  When placement is completed, you collect a reward (generally an upgrade) and/or collect a noble.  Collecting both requires an expenditure of money, which is tight in this game, and the nobles themselves score BIG end of game points if you collect enough of them.  

You can alternatively go fight (place your knight) in a battle against the French- this has the benefit of *almost* certainly scoring at least some points, potentially multiple times and will certainly award you a small favour (like money, maybe a noble etc).  A phase where new laws are to be voted in (or not) then occurs and these can be a source of victory points as well- here you use voting cubes which are another currency that expire after each round but which can be powerful to sway the outcome in your favour.  You then collect smaller rewards from your castle which hopefully you can upgrade during the course of the game.

End of game points are also awarded for the most upgraded castle (you also benefit in game for having an upgraded castle) and for having the most/most upgraded knights (you also benefit in game for having this setup).

This does not seem on the surface to be overly original but it is a well-designed euro strategy game with some minor but quality twists on known mechanics.  The whole is better than the sum of its parts.  Seems to scale from 2-5 players but 2er looks like you have some dummy player managing to do (annoying).

Own the [boardgame=107863]New Laws[/boardgame], [boardgame=132431]Reward Tiles[/boardgame], and [boardgame=132150]Henry V[/boardgame] expansions.

After a few few plays with "Lancaster":

1) Very nice material, finds the "easy ones"
    to clear structures fantastically & very much 
    atmospherically 

2) Romp from tared play mechanisms, 
     to win varied possibilities, 
     very interactively & sometimes a little 
     nasty :-) 

3) In 2 people variation-> 
    - too fast past, some would be able 
      Be play years more
    - the allies did not come with us to
      Application, more facade 
(one may use only either his knights, or those of the ally, or we have wrong read the rule?) 
, otherwise also well in twos!

Any time I / we play it with pleasure....

RATING: 8
Lancaster is one of the better worker placements that I've played. In a nutshell, there's a little more player interaction, and the extra elements that keep it from being a 'pure' worker placement (like Russian Railroads) are generally a positive addition. I love the blind voting on new laws, and having played the game half a dozen times, familiarity with the laws lets you anticipate and adjust your strategy accordingly. 

This is a more medium-weight game, but I've had success playing it with players of varying skills and experience with games. There's a lot of moving parts, but they cohere in a simple way that makes sense. I especially love how you can boot players off of a space, which gives you that player interaction many WP games lack.

There are four main elements of the game: board, nobles, player board, and France. Nobles seemed to be overpowered but we've compensated for that in our latest plays. The player boards do seem a little underpowered but there might be a way to exploit that strategy effectively. In general, you will be rewarded by going for a primary strategy with a polite sprinkling of all the other strategies. Unlike Russian Railroads, you don't need a laser-like focus on one single strategy to win the game; Lancaster lets you dabble a bit.

Overall, this is an unexpectedly good game from Queen, proving they can turn out the hits alongside the crap. I really appreciate the brain-space that it works in, and I'll rarely turn down a game of this with some friends. A rock-solid worker placement base, with a great theme make Lancaster good. All of the extras, like shoving your opponent off a space, voting for new laws, and fighting the bloody French, make Lancaster a great game.

Solid performance. Although being almost as euro as a game can be, you could even call it a bit thematic actually. I reckon this is achieved with the very confrontational mechanics. However, I'd say that in the long run the game might need an expansion or two to add some variance from game to game. This is yet to be seen, though.

Nice game.  It impressed me at first.  I liked the theme and it was fun.  There is a lot going on even if just about all of it is rehashed from various other euros.  It feels 80% Euro 20% waro to me.  If it was slightly more waro, it may have been a bit more orignal.  It does go on a fair bit longer than it suggests on the box and can be prone to AP.  Would play it again.

If you have played all the others the there's not much to say for Lancaster, except one or two others are worse, and not much to say against it, except perhaps that its dull and boring. Squire-outbidding is a slow process. I'd imagine you'd do all the same things every time, so low repeat play value.

+ Reward Tiles.

After I tried the worker placement mechanism for the first time, I wanted to find a game from this category for my collection and I had a really clear idea in my mind. I wanted a game with player boards where you can build something, with a playing time of 90min maximum and without annoying randomness. Lancaster seemed to be the game for me and, after few plays, I can say I was not wrong. 

It's a wonderful game and a very particular take on otherwise classic euro-game mechanisms. I like a lot the idea of workers with levels, the bidding mechanism and the way you can improve your castle to get special extra resources and actions every turn. What really makes Lancaster interesting is its worker-placement mechanism, that is all focused on the placement aspect. You have to dissimulate your intentions, really place your knights wisely and use your resources very carefully. I really enjoy the challenge that this element brings to the game. Even though I like this aspect so much, I must admit that the thing that really makes Lancaster shine for me is the Parliament Phase. I like the political feel, the discussions and the negotiation that it brings to the game. It's an excellent addendum to the game recipe and one that brings flavor, longevity and different tactics to it.

Yet the game has some flaws: The nobles are too important and there's a small amount of laws, which makes games predictable after few plays. Fortunately I think that these minor issues are very well fixed by the expansions, which I strongly recommend. With them Lancaster is truly awesome.

Rating without expansions: 7.5

I was very impressed by this game. I went into it feeling like I was crossing an item off my list. Some of my game partners liked it, so I wanted to give it a chance. 

After playing, I give the theme a 5, but the rest of the game more than makes up for it. Short playtime, lots of strategic options, blocking/attacking, reluctant teamwork in battles, and even some voting/table talk to round it out.

If I can pick this one up at a reasonable price, I probably will.

RATING: 6
A simple worker placement (bidding-like) game that is enjoyable to play with the right group. Don't need to look too deep into the theme or what it meant to simulate and it's a light euro-family game that is done in an hour or so. 

Component is beautiful, the knight tokens stands out really well. Nothing special about mechanics or setting. 

Battle fought reminds me slightly of Medival though. 

An average game indeed.

Lancaster is a cleverly disguised auction game, in which multiple items are auctioned at once.  The disguise is that your bidding units are knights and squires and you're placing them in different locations to get different things.

Also present, in more familiar guises are engine building, set collection, area control, oh and voting on "laws" in the style of Cuba.  Rather like Matthias Cramer's earlier Glen More, familiar things are assembled into a tight, clever and engaging machine. I particularly like the tensions this game presents between grabbing points now and building your engine.  Oh, and with five players this is a highly interactive dog fight.  Splendid.

Queen packs a whole load of cardboard and wood into the box, some of it fairly redundant.  The artwork is decent and functional, if not very exciting. The rules seem comprehensive, I've found no issues over several plays.

RATING: 8
Good eurogame with a typical medieval theme but the interesting gameplay compensates that. It has a lot of mechanics like worker placement, voting, area control, bidding etc Everything blends well and makes perfect sense. Very interactive for a eurogame since you can displace opponents knights (workers) by using one of yours if he is of greater level. Good production values.

RATING: 6
This is a decent worker placement game with some distinct ideas about what it wants to do with the worker placement mechanic, for example, upgrading your worker strength and displacing other workers.  It adds to these ideas, a seemingly interesting "vote for the laws that apply to the game" mechanic, and a relatively bland generic set collection and upgrade your castle mechanic.  

For me, these distinct ideas were interesting, but not appreciably fun to play around with.  In particular, most worker placement games focus on making sure that with each worker placement you put on the board, you "feel" like you REALLY want that thing you are getting.  

Thus, for example, in many worker placement games, you get a sought after resource that you later convert into something else you really want, or use to run the engine you  have built.  Or you get an animal to take care of, or a crop to grow, which you then tend such that you maximize points.  Or you get a cool card that you add to your engine that you, thereafter, really want to build and run.  Or, you get a tile you really want to place and own, or make part of an engine.  Or, you win a cool temporary or permanent power, etc.

In Lancaster, the things you are expected to really want with each placement are:  upgrading the strength of your worker for subsequent plays, getting another worker, getting a somewhat drab set collection mechanic chit, getting victory points, getting a very slight advantage in an eventual vote on laws, or getting money or round to round upgrades, which might help you get more of the preceding things I just mentioned.  

For me, this list was just not inspiring enough, particularly when compared to other worker placement games.  Yes, it works on its own terms, but its terms are not that interesting, particularly when compared to the many other, better designed worker placement games out there.

Lastly, the "law passing mechanic" here is driven by an auction wherein you "close your fist" with your surprise bid, and then everyone reveals their secret bids, thus placing the game state at the whim of "guessing" bids appropriately.  Secret bidding is probably my least favorite auction mechanic, well, that and the displacement on the board of a prior bid for something you really wanting, and thereby forcing your prior bid to go somewhere else that you do not want as much, which is also a mechanic essentially used in this game.  For my tastes, not the auction mechanics I enjoy playing around with.

To be honest I did not understand this game at all. The rules are absolutely chaotic. Many game steps are missing and the players continuously are in trouble to build a strategy and looking at the rules does not help them at all.

Great production value, and very interesting gameplay. Learning to play isn't difficult, but it definitely takes effort by the players to learn to oversee how all the different parts of this game work together, and to get a good grasp for the timing of events. The end result is a very balanced work of art, where you win by seeing the sequences of actions that turn out to be just a tiny bit better than other actions, and build out on them, yet remain nimble enough to change your direction at any time.

Jól összerakott, szép játék, megérte végre kipróbálni. Nagyon konfliktusos a kitúrós akcióválasztós mechanizmus miatt, ami egyébként tetszik. A szavazós rész is jó. Kicsit nehéz volt megszokni a fázisok sorrendjét. A játék hibájának érzem, hogy túlságosan egyértelműen a nemesekre kell menni, itt még talán dominánsabbak a nemesek, mint a Szentpétervárban. Ami viszont nagy pozitívum, az a jó ikonrendszer.
Jó játék, szívesen játszom vele máskor is, remélem több sikerrel:).

Lancaster is a very fine game, with gorgeous production. It is not an innovative game: all its mechanics (worker placement, engine construction, voting) have already been used elsewhere. But everything comes together in a very pleasant manner. The squires add an interesting twist, but also the need to keep track of everyone else's supply to place enough to keep vital spots. Game length is quite short (both turns-wise and time-wise), and every turn there's agonizing decisions between points and engine-building. In the end, it is very enjoyable and I am eager to play it again!

RATING: 8.5
Firstly the components in this game are some of the best if not the best in any type of game in this category.

The card stock is so thick it feels like it is made of wood, as are the knight pieces. The board is of equal quality.

Don't be put off by the complexity rating here on BGG which I think is a 3+. It's really simple to understand and the rules are very easy to read, and are only 3 or 4 pages. The only complexity is how the phases go and remembering which way round which after two or three plays becomes second nature.

The game flow is elegant and fast. The theme is there and it has a beautiful mix of genres which it does equally well.

Sometimes games that try to be Jack of all trades fail miserably but not Lancaster. Its the best worker placement I know as there is just enough 'take that' and tactics to spice it up over other WP games like Stone Age etc.

There is also a heavy dose of bluffery going on in the knight and squire placement and also the excellent voting of new Laws to pass. Its so much fun and simple.

My 12-year-old video game loving son loves this game and has won both times we have played by a country mile. My wife also loves the game. It's a real Sunday afternooner.

The game plays in an hour, long enough to develop your strategy but not long enough to drag.

I've been looking for a Euro game that has enough conflict, tactical and strategic but not brain hurting, great components, thematic, lightweight but heavy enough, simple but complex all at the same time, for a while now.

Not many games hit all those points but Lancaster certainly does for us :)

I enjoyed playing it but it can get frustrated at times. It's worker placement with a twist in which you can kick your opponents out of a space with more powerful knights+squires. So you have to be careful when you place your knights. It's almost like you are bidding for a space unlike the typical WP games. There is also a voting phase each round to determine if some new laws will be passed, which would benefit only some players. Thus, leading to a little bit of negotiation. There is always a struggle between getting more knights, upgrading your knights and collecting resources/end game bonus through out the game. Overall it is a game for people who like a combination of WP+bidding.

Quite aggressive actually. Plus the clever use of the workers as they are not all "equal" as they bump other opponents out of certain areas (castles). This allows for the inclusion of area control, which is something I don't have a lot of in my collection. Finally, the voting on the laws is quite nice for added theme.

First Play: struggled initially with the rules but once sorted this is a fast and nasty compact little game. All over in an hour and you are left wanting more.

Second play: The rules are very straightforward to explain. New comers picked it up easily. There really is a lot going on and multiple paths to victory although the barons are very powerful if left unchecked.  I'm tempted to up grade this to 8.5

Further plays prove this to be a popular game with new comers. The statement that the Barons are similar in effect to the Aristocrats in St Petersburg are spot on. You just cant let someone gather a full set. Rating up-ed to 8.25.

It's a worker placement game where you have an opportunity to shove out opponents who take a spot you want. But maybe they'll come back and oust you as well! (It's really sort of an auction style of mechanic if you think about it...) You try to claim spots for special bonuses to build up your "engine" and for set collection for points. There is also a brilliant parliament phase where all players must wheel and deal to either pass or reject laws each round, which provide bonuses / points for players who meet the criteria. It's very fun and highly interactive. I'd say there is also almost zero luck, but maybe I need to think about it more closely.

First play went pretty well.  It's an interesting game of auctioning and outbidding other players.  Not sure about the long term re-playability, but it certainly is an interesting game with plenty of choices and options.  Second play finished very spread out which was odd to me as it feels like a game that should remain pretty balanced.  I've enjoyed my plays of this okay, but it doesn't feel like a great game.

This is a fast euro that is very interactive. During worker placement your bumping each other off and using squires to try and hang on to the best spots. Then during parliament, you are trying to push your laws through and gain support from other players. Down in the french conflict area, the rules make it possible to steal point from each other but you also need other players to help you win the battle. This game was designed from the ground up to create player interaction of different types. 

This is a fantastic game.

Light worker placement game, with some interesting strategic choices. I really like voting in the new laws each round and trying to get them to line up with what is going to benefit you the most.

Lancaster is a middle-weight eurogame with nothing innovative about it. However, the sum of all its well-known mechanisms results in a good solid game for the family or a light gamers' session. No wonder it was nominated for the 2011 Spiel des Jahres Kennerspiel Game of the Year. 

I particularly dig the light confrontation between the players over the castles (actions), the law votes and the different strategies one can pursue. As per Queen Games standards, the production values are spectacular.

At first this looked like a run-of-the-mill "I put down my guy, you knock him out" area control game like Courtier or 1960. But the game has a lot of interesting things going on, especially once you introduce the expansions. The laws are an absolutely brilliant addition, and I'm surprised similar mechanics haven't been introduced in other games since this came out. 

Apart from the area control, the game feels very much like a typical point-maximization Euro, with different routes to take for points, but with the conflict enabled by the knights, which I like a lot. More games should have tiered strengths for their workers! I love the two-player variant with the ally houses: a very interesting touch that simulates well how a third player might limit players' choices during the game.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Good worker placement game in which you have workers (knights) with different "levels", where higher level-workers can kick out lower-level workers. This does thus feel more like a hybrid auction/worker placement game, since worker are kicked out of spaces, and reassigned to another places.
++ I like the laws voting system where players have to vote the new "Laws" which change de gameplay (because it adds options and bonuses) for everyone for a one or two turns (until they are abolished by having more laws voted). You can either vote Yes or No (obviously!), but also supplement you vote with your influence cubes, thus the result of the voting depend on the influence each player gets prior the voting phase. This voting process is really tense and lead to really great moments.
++ There are expansions available for this game (which is useful to refresh the game when we have overplayed it).


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- The game seem to be recommended at 3-player and best at the 4 players count, and we mainly play 2-players games.
-- The setup and tear-down times are longer than I like (even if all the pieces are well organized in a plastic organizer and in small containers).
-- This game take a fair bit of table space, with the central board, the player's boards (castles) and the laws board.
-- I hate having to put sticker on game parts (but I know why they do it instead of printing on the parts).

RATING: 7
Pretty standard, but good, Euro fare where there are a bunch of resources and players have to figure out how to best acquire/manager those resources to turn them into points.  Overall, there's nothing really new or inventive here, but it all comes together very nicely.

The game is essentially a take on worker placement, where your workers (knights) can be made both stronger and more plentiful throughout the game.  Through shrewd placement, they can score you points directly, or make you money and give you other upgrades that will help you score points.

Perhaps the coolest mechanism is a phase where players vote on new rules for the round, all of which will reward players for certain things, like having certain knight in play, or having a lot of money.  The real coolness is that each player doesn't just have one vote, but may have multiple votes due to a commodity in the game called voting cubes.  Let's say you have a bunch of cubes; you could turn over a "no" vote along with 4 voting cubes, for a total of 5 "no" votes against an issue.  This makes voting less of a foregone conclusion, as often there is only one player that wants something to happen, but if he uses a bunch of cubes he might end up beating all the other players' votes!

Overall, a very nicely contrived worker placement and resource management game!

Enjoyable Euro with a touch of theme.  I like the worker placement mechanic with workers having different strengths.  I also really dug the wars in France semi-cooperative thing as it made for interesting analysis and gamesmanship.

An intriguing worker-placement game.  Unusually perhaps, the theme actually detracts from the game.  There are a few game situations/mechanics which seem odd but work for the game. However, the 'oddness' is made to seem more extreme by virtue of the theme.  Some of the graphics also suggest that 'someone' had no more than a cursory knowledge of the period.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Deep, but not overburdening on the decisions. There is plenty to do.  I like the engine building with the castle Keep, and building up your knights to have stronger "workers" to go and bully others out! I would gladly play this again, and actually want to buy it.  2 turns in and I was completely sold on the game. Everything you need is there. Enough decisions to keep you interested, not so many that you feel like a deer in the headlights. I definitely found it interesting that none of us used our castle boards to send any of our knights to, to receive the action on our board. In a 5 player game it might become more necessary. I was only disappointed that there wasn't a better tie breaker. If Dustin had played his last turn a little differently then he would have won, so in my heart I give the win to him. I know that with Cosmic Encounter I am fine with multiple winners...but it fits Cosmic so much better than this game.  This one is making it on my "to buy" list, and when I see a good enough deal and my budget is right it'll get added... after Splendor.

Tentative rating. It's not bad, just sort of milquetoast. The theme is entirely tacked on and arbitrary, which is fine usually, but for some reason it really bothered me here. I like the way that the several little subsystems (voting, building your board, fighting over territory) interact. But yeah, at heart it's just another one of "those" Euros. Maybe another play or two could bring out its charms.

An interesting meld of worker placement and auction in a traditional euro package.  The twist is provided by periodic player voting on what bonuses will be awarded and what bonuses will be eliminated.

Very nice area majority/auction game. I love the mix of cutthroat competition for the actions through the amun-re(ish) style auctions with the need for cooperation when fighting the French. I have found the scoring to be very balanced. Finally, a new Euro with some meaty interaction. 

Update: Bumped to a 9. With 5 players, this is a tight, brilliant and balanced game. It's a great sign when after a year of having not played a game, everyone easily remembers the rules. It is simple and streamlined, but the laws, the French, the extra actions, the squires etc add enough spice to make for a terrific game. I haven't seen anyone (including me) blown away by this on first play, but this just comes alive with repeat play. With 4, probably a 7. Not worth playing with less than 4.

[i]Received this after winning the Queen Games Lancaster contest.[/i]

So, I won this game in a contest, but I probably would not have picked it up otherwise. I heard about it, and thought "yet another worker placement game," and moved on. 

But now that I've played this a handful of times, I've discovered that Lancaster is a fluid, slick and interactive game that pretty much everyone in my gaming circles has enjoyed. And, I'm not convinced it's really worker placement. Players can reinforce a worker with "squires," and can even kick other players out of a spot. It strays into a bidding game, and it feels like a cross between worker placement and Amun-Re-style bidding.

So, a turn involves placing knights, voting on laws, getting goodies in England (the main board), scoring your castle (your player board), and scoring/resolving conflicts in France (VP source). The highlight for me is voting on the "laws," which are various tiles that award points or resources based on certain conditions. Every round involves voting on three laws, with players adding to their votes with voting cubes. It's a great dynamic. The combination of worker placement, voting, and multiple paths to victory... this game provides a lot of tough decisions. 

I've not yet played this with five players, but I'd really like to try. Four players is noticeably tighter (and better!) than with three, as those spaces in France fill up faster. I'd like to see how an even tighter game plays out.

I had thought at one point that it was a little too easy to get all your knights or complete all of your castle...two big sources of VP bonuses at the end. However, getting all the knights or completing the entire castle is no guarantee for victory, and this game has more open paths for winning than I first assumed. Each play I like this more.

Update: we played this once with five players, and one player almost broke the game by totally abusing the start player position. I can't exactly recall the specifics, but it totally soured my gaming group on this one. After watching it sit on my shelf, I finally traded it away. 

I'd still be willing to play this again, and I do think it's a solid game, but a game without an audience is a luxury I don't want to pursue.

Lancaster is a worker placement game with dynamic rules or laws from voting in the Parliament. We can change the rules for the sake to optimize our own benefit. Of course we have to gain influence power from our worker placement or invite nobles. It's a good game; with that attractive price (around HK$350) and topnotch quality, it becomes a very good game!
The new rules expansion should be added into the base game to make it more competitive and confrontation!

Remarks:
We should add one more turn to the end of the game!!!

Great worker placement game that also combines elements that remind me of area control.  Your workers are knights that can vary in power level.  You can play them in three different areas: English counties, the war on France, or your own castle.  
On the England portion of the map, you place your knights like a typical worker placement game, however, your knights can be bumped out of their space by opponents playing a knight with a higher value.
The France portion of the board works more like area control where you can stack up multiple knights and the goal is to be the player with the most value.
Lots of direct conflict for a Euro.

Interesting mechanics: people fight/ bid for spots and resources. 
Similar to other games:  other multiple scoring euro games. Fresco, puerto Rico, etc.
General thoughts:  Really well done euro. Great quality as expected from a queen game. Good playing time and high strategy.

This seems like a game I should like more than I do (after one play).  

Its beautifully produced, and the rules seemed clean. The game was tense throughout, and there were lots of interesting choices. 

But something about the game kind of niggled at me in an unpleasant way.  I couldn't put my finger on it, and I'd be happy to play it again...but might not think to request it. 

A game that I should get more attention from me, but probably won't be able to out-compete other titles for the table time.

Just a generic worker placement game. I didn't think that the bidding for action spaces added much besides length and the laws were not that interesting. I'd play it again, but I doubt it would distinguish itself from all of the other worker placement games out there.

Update after a few more games: yeah, this is the real thing. Fantastic game. Again, perfect amount of randomness, and it's only setup randomness, once at the beginning of the game, but it gets revealed incrementally round by round.
-------------
Quick rating after 1 play. Core rules are pretty simple, but lots of options with lots of pros/cons on seemingly every turn. Nice voting mechanic reminscent of In The Shadow of the Emperor. Perfect amount of randomness for me. You get some new tiles which come up with variable amount of points to fight for, and new "laws" that players can vote on to pass or veto. But nothing random that directly affects one player.

RATING: 7
First impression: Here we have really gorgeous components and nice graphics paired with interesting mechanisms, but none of them are new. Our first play took more than 2h, when the box says only 60min, but we had two AP-prone players in it. I liked the play and if it could be played in a hour or so, it could be a great middleweight game. 

The play showed that different strategies are indeed applicable but i had wished for a little more involved game.  The combat part is also highly abstract and very simple with close to none variation form game to game - same with the laws. 

Second impression:
The second play was MUCH faster (70min) and more enjoyable also. I still find the game a bit on the light side, but this is no bad sign.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Lancaster is a game my brain just refuses to warm up to. It probably has to do with the fact that it suffers to some extent from kitchen sink syndrome coupled with but a few rounds of play; and on top of that a hellishly annoying 'laws'-phase in which extra bonuses are voted in and out of existence. Proponents will immediately argue that this phase is what makes the game... but the annoying thing is that you really do not have a good idea of what the other players will do: there's too much to consider for the closed bids to 'work' as they do in much, much simpler titles. There is fundamental uncertainty here which can either help or break your game.

In summary there is so much multiplexing going on that every time I wonder why I bother in the first place. There is nice art and the cool idea of upgradeable influence... but you're prodded and pushed and made to run before you can walk. Not a fan.

Prachtig spel, leuk worker-placement. Het tijdselement is nodig (itt Ninjato en Colosseum vind ik) hoewel het spel daardoor sneller voorbij is dan me lief was. Je ziet vrij vroeg in wanneer de situatie niet meer haalbaar is (tegenstander kasteel geupgrade + grotere riddermacht)

I love this game. It seems perfectly balanced, has a great theme, and great components. I love that the different knights are different thicknesses--so you know at a glance if you are going to be able to beat someone out of their placement. It seems difficult to get this game out on the table though, as it takes a long time to play. I would love to play this game much more and hope that I do get to play it more often.

Components: Lots of great bits. The knights, squires, voting cubes, and gold all work well. The castle banners look great on the player boards, but are difficult to discern from across the table (to see how many an opponent has). The phase order is disjointed, with phases 1, 3, and 5 taking place on the board, such that we must hop around. The law and invader tiles could be slimmed down to cards.

Experience: There is a lot going on in this game. Either the designer was trying to work in all the various thematic elements, or was just trying to make it complicated. The game feels a bit like Agricola in that the best strategy seems to be balance, rather than in specialization. Sure, one could go after the nobles or banners or laws aggressively, but victory will probably go to the player who is best able to win points efficiently in a variety of places, with the least effort. This is also one of those games like Stone Age where the score might seem close heading into the end game, but the final scoring can have huge swings. Watch out, new players!

My playing was with 3 players, and all areas of the board were tightly contested. I can see that with more players, the board conflict will escalate, and more knights will end up in battle or on player castles. Perhaps with more players we would be forced to specialize.

Lancaster has a good theme with interesting game stages.  The rules are very easy.  There is a lot of friendly competition.  All the rules relate well to things that make sense in the game.  The laws (for me) wasn't as good as the rest of the game, but I usually hate voting mechanics...so take that with a grain of salt.  Lancaster also plays fast.  So don't spend too much time on your engine like I did.  Overall, it's a solid game that should be able to hit the table often.  Definitely worth at least one play.

Really good interplay between all the mechanics on this one.

A worker placement game of sorts, each of your workers has a certain strength (1-4), which allows you to displace weaker workers and also allows you to better fight against external conflicts.

But, there's also a law mechanic where certain activities (like gaining or improving workers, or scoring) either come into effect or get out-voted. Your votes can be augmented by gaining noblemen at your castle (to vote your way).

All of this interacts very smoothly and cleverly. Nice game.

So clever! I love the way upgrading and placing knights is spread out over the resolution phases. Fantastic worker placement/auction hybrid distills all the angst of both mechanisms.

Edit: At higher player counts the constant knocking off and replacing of knights can really drag on for way too long. If you are with patient people who aren't going to reach for their phones and check out when faced with downtime, the pros (specifically more excitement in the Lawmaking phase) far outweigh the cons. If not, choose something else.

A pretty decent game, especially if you go for the underhanded, sneaky, backstabbing style of game play.  This game encourages lots of screwage for your opponents, especially the novel "voting" mechanic.  When you're in the mood for all that, this is an ideal game.  I can't see this being played every game night, but every so often, it's just plain ol' evil fun.

Hard game to rate. On one hand there are a lot of nice things here, the different knights (in different sizes which is cool), the fight for the castles where you can push out each other with help of squires, how you recruit nobles, the wars and their benefits and so on. 

On the other hand the closed voting system for new laws nearly kills this game for me. Stupid, boring and way too important.

After 1 play rating it a 7.

This is really more of a bidding game where you essentially can buy more bidding chips.  High bidder for a certain spot on the board gets the benefit.  It's a fun game to play, but not sure how much replayability it has.  The laws come out randomly but really the voting on them is filled with chaos.

I could see this dropping a point maybe, but not really going up beyond 7.

Players are English nobles, trying to build a power base to impress Henry V.  Silky smooth five turn game, where players despatch their knights to either a county in England, their castle, or to the wars in France.  Counties in England either grant a noble at your dinner table (enhancing your chances in parliament, and your end game score), or some sort of immediate reward.  If you stump up 3 gold, you can take both - very useful.  At your castle, you can also get an immediate reward - however here it's locked in and can't be taken off you.  Finally, in France you also get a reward (if you're one of the first six knights there), and you're in the running for some nice victory points if France is defeated.  The game is all about setting up a nice engine of powerful knights (they upgrade in strength), coin, squires (helpful meeples), voting cubes, and victory points.  It looks busy, it seems busy, but plays out very smoothly.  Standard worker placement mechanics have been augmented a little by the displacement rule, where a knight in England can be ousted by a more powerful knight (or even a weaker knight, supplemented with some squires) - these displaced knights get to go again, and it leads to a cautious dance as you try and bluff your opponent out of knights and squires, so you can end up where you really want to go!  Production wise, the game is lovely, and the different height knights to denote their strength is genius - the height of the stack gives the total strength at a glance.  I liked this game a lot.

Neat little worker placement game.  It flows super smooth but has a unique timing to it that makes playing it well very satisfying.

Thematically this game has voting; mechanically this game does not have voting - it has blind bidding.  That's exactly why it works so well with 2 players.  It actually works much better with 2 players than BGG's "community recommended" would lead you to believe.  Very often that is pretty accurate - but absolutely not in this case.

Plays very fast when you have the rules down.  That said, it's easy to make mistakes the first few games because the rulebook has some sloppy wording.

Worker placement with aggressive player interaction. Game play is easy to pick up, and the rule book does a good job of explaining everything. As with any worker placement game, gaining more workers is the first, critical strategy. But the ability to displace other players' knights with a stronger force creates quite an interesting dynamic. Yet displaced knights can be replaced, creating some give-and-take in the take-that atmosphere.

2017-06-17 : Can't believe it's been 3 years since we last played this gem - 3 new players of which 2 immediately "got" the game, so it was a fight all the way. I love games where even on the first play people can excel at it even against a veteran player.

With more and more games being released these days, the difference between a good and a great eurogame is becoming more and more arbitrary. Games with voting never really appeal to me.

That being said, some will appreciate this game.

I like this - more interaction than your typical worker placement, minimal randomness, and about the right weight. Might even be an "8", but I haven't played it enough to say that with confidence.   

The ability to "bump" others workers for an extra cost makes it less like worker placement and more like an auction. I also like the voting mechanic quite well.  

Just the right balance of strategy and interaction, with voting, blocking, overbidding, and cooperating in wars.

A far cry from Glen More, unfortunately. Glen More had tight decisions and tension so thick you could cut it with a knife. Lancaster was bland - even the artwork was bland and that's saying a lot considering that this is a Queen game. The biggest weakness is that for a worker placement game, the worker placement was too drawn out and a lot of bouncing around to reach decisions that could have been made a couple of placements earlier. Now, the game is not a total disaster - it works but it just isn't fun.

A very well made, clever and tactical game. 
The voting section really captures the theme. Great mechanics and great period of history.

Like a lot of Queen games, it is a three or more player game with a 2 player version that kind of works thrown in.

Not really convinced in a five player game..., if you have buddies thinking to much about their possibilities and counting...

Rules are not "old" Queen Games standard, too many important things on different sheets..., descriptions placed on the back of the setting sheet..., not included direct in the rules...

...as an owner of more than 35 Queen Games, I'm not happy with their decision, making now "high pricing" games only. I will definitely purchase less, that means not every output..., I will select and not pay the full price on any Queen Game!

Lancaster is, to me, one of the essentials of Eurogames. It does the worker-placement thing very well, and adds just enough excitement to the theme to make you feel like you're doing more than cube-pushing. Good strategy. Good theme. And it has expansions that make it even better. Since it came out, though, I think it has been eclipsed by a lot of similar games.

+ Lancaster is everything I want in a Eurogame.  Worker placement, direct conflict, area control, politics, upgrading and improving.  Love it.  
+ The theme is great, and it transports me to that world, I can feel like a noble lord improving my holds to please the King and war with France.

Really enjoyed my first play of this.  Lots of decision making, some combat, politics in the laws voting, and quick moving.  Needs a sensible rules explanation to ensure that you grab advisors and don't get left behind. Second play much the same opinion although now with a feeling that "everything" you do will score, just some actions score more than others.

I actually liked this area-control game enough to agree to a second play after being absolutely destroyed in a 5p game. It exhibits support for a huge variety of styles of play (grabbing Nobles, not upgrading or growing your armies at all, upgrading/hiring lots), is quick, smooth, and has a very interesting laws mechanic I enjoy.

Purchased 11/04/2014.  German edition but came with English rules! (not the English setup sheet though)

Awesome game!  only 5 rounds and you feel the game ends too early but that's part of the tension.  Beautiful board and components and the different thickness knights are very cool.

Upgraded to the Big Box edition.

Egy elég száraz, de jó mechanizmusú worker placement. Nincs sok közvetlen interakció az ellenfelekkel, ám mégis iszonyatosan kell figyelni rájuk.

RATING: 7
Lancaster is a sort of hybrid of worker placement and area control. Players need to build up their engines (recruit more knights for more actions, train your knights for more choice, extend castles for more resources) and grab points in between. The game combines a fair number of well-used mechanics into something that doesn't feel quite like anything else yet still lacks uniqueness, if that makes any sense.

Game length is pleasantly short in general, even though the deployment phase can become a little drawn out because of the repeated displacements.

Es gab eine Zeit, da musste sich das Eurogame nicht groß bemühen, um ein Thema für seine Abstraktionen zu finden: man griff einfach mit der Hand ins dunkle Mittelalter. Dabei zeigt sich das Mittelalter in LANCASTER in seiner ganzen Grobstofflichlichkeit: Der Startspielerbrocken ist eine Kante aus Deutscher Eiche so groß wie ein Stück französischer Käse. Der Sichtschirm ist eine Trutzburg. Die Krönung sind die Ritter, die sich in ihrer holzklotzigen Gestalt vom Namensvetter Ritter Sport inspirieren ließen: Quadratisch, praktisch, gut. Das Wort Interaktion beschreibt den Fight in LANCASTER noch milde. Offene Aggression trifft es besser. Bei den Gesetzabstimmungen wird unverhohlen auf Mitspieler suggestiv eingeredet: „Du musst mit Nein stimmen, der kriegt dafür X Punkte. Sonst bist Du blöd.“. Der Abnutzungskampf beim Rittereinsatz zieht sich gegen Ende, weil jeder der rausgeschmissenen Ritter eine Kettenreaktion in Gang setzt, weil er beim Wiedereinsetzen seinerseits nun einen schwächeren Ritter rausschmeißt, der wiederum einen anderen rausschmeißt, der wiederum einen anderen rausschmeißt, der wiederum einen anderen rausschmeißt. LANCASTER kennt keine Freunde. Wer mit Tritten gegen das Schienbein ein Probleme hat sollte einen Pfeil und Bogen um das Spiel machen. Auch heute noch. Great Game. Auch auch heute noch.

My kind of worker placement game.  I really like the variable strengths of the knights, that adds some depth to worker placement and the ability to displace knights with more powerful forces creates direct player interaction often missing in most other worker placement games. Low randomness, but variability due to random order of conflicts and structured random order of laws.

Played a 2-player game vs. Luke on July 2, 2011. I won 50-49, but i think Luke actually won due to a mis-applied rule. But we can't remember. If so, I would have had only 48 points. 
We both really enjoyed the game. 

July 18, 2011 - Now three games in. Really enjoyed all 3 games. I played much better this game, but don't know exactly what I did that made the difference. I did go for Castle Expansions early on. Picked my battles carefully. Worked to get lots of Squires & Money. Got lots of nobles (21 points worth). Scored regularly with Parliament.

Lancaster is a very nice worker placement game where you are trying to out-power your opponents for certain benefits in the game.  There is also a unique voting system for extra bonuses, which I thought I'd enjoy more when I read about it but it didn't wow me as I predicted. That being said, it was a still a solid addition to the game and just the fact that it is unique means that it doesn't bother me at all. (Though having to do some number crunching for each player on who would benefit the most on certain things, how many voting cubes each player has, etc., can be a bit of a pain.)  Still, the game moves at a nice clip and never feels draggy or boring.  Great component quality.  A nice mix of player interaction and confrontation, but nothing too mean.  Quite a solid game.  Glad to have it!

Currently my favorite worker placement game. Actually, a worker DIS-placement game! High quality components with some nice touch (the pawns in different heights to mark strength levels are an ingenious feature), surprisingly easy rules, fast playing time (about 1 hour to finish a game with so much strategy and zero luck is quite an achievement) and the moderate player interaction through displacement, semi-cooperation and voting contribute to tell Lancaster apart from the crowd of WP games. The only drawbacks are the use of the trite Medieval theme (can we come up with something new, please?) and the somewhat uninspired art of the main board, with a depressing use of muted colours.
The big expansion (Henry V) elevates the game to new strategic heights without complicating the rules too much, the new laws and the reward tiles add variety, so I highly recommend those as well.

RATING: 8
Maximise your VP by allocating a limited number of actions to gain resources and points - sounds familiar - nothing particularly new here except virtually every option is available from the get-go - so allocating those 2 initial knights (read workers) to improve your longer term VP scoring potential or grab some early points is the dilemma. Some good player interaction build into the contest for control of the Counties which are just one of, but an important source of resources and points or you can stay within your own castle and avoid conflct. The components are excellent, the decisions many and interesting to balance improving your points scoring engine against actually scoring those points in the limited number of turns available. Lots happenning. Very, very good.

The basic idea of the game is neat: a worker placement with the chance of fighting other workers, but without a random element involved in the fight (so not to make it luck-driven). However, for some reason, it does not "click". Probably it's the disconnection between one action and the other: focusing on something appears to be difficult and you end up getting the best you can afford (some actions are simply better than others, adding stuff to the same basic thing), thus the strategy suffer. I did very well, but I am not sure I deserved to.

Opinion: a simple game with lot of interaction, in 10 mins you can be ready to play. You have worker placement with your knights, but you have to see where to put them, how to upgrade them and how to bring more knights into the table. You only have 3 spaces to go for your knights, but the fight for the spaces is great. This is an example on how a simple game can be awesome

One of those games that attempts to have depth by adding lots of stuff. Worker placement is at its core, but it also has voting for laws a la "Cuba", a sort of bidding or area majorities (in the battles), and scoring a set of nobles in the best "Saint Petersburg" style. Everything works, but there is nothing particularly new or engaging. In the end, it's just another worker placement game, except that this time you can kick other players' workers out.

Nice WP game with many different ways to choose from, while you have to have an eye on your opponents, aswell as on the laws and wars and...

The only thing I don't like that much is the blind bidding, as you will rarely be able to force a law through on your own. However, that's just a smal detail in an overall very good game.

The rules are easy to explain and the game doesn't take ages to finish. While I don't think that 60 min. is very accurate (maybe for 2 players or with 3 if you don't plan ahead everything), it shouldn't take longer than 90 min., even with 4. Not sure about a 5 player game, but I guess it won't take much longer if at all.

Joc de col·locació de treballadors on els treballadors tenen un valor númeric de "força" assignat (que es correspon amb la seva alçada). Certs espais requereixen una força mínima i, en altres es poden apilar treballadors per sumar més força. Una de les gracies del joc és que es pot fer fora d'un espai a un treballador amb un altre que superi el valor de "força", que es pot augmentar amb uns meeples d'escuder, el nombre dels quals és secret (estan darrere d'una pantalla). L'altre gracia del joc és una fase de votació, on s'aproven o es deneguen unes lleis, de les que se'n apliquen tres cada torn, entre les noves que s'han aprobat i les antigues que ja estaven presents. Molt sobreproduit, amb components de molta qualitat. El joc es guanya per punts de victoria mitjançant la col·lecció d'unes losetes de nobles, els punts obtinguts durant la partida per la resol·lució de les guerres i una puntuació final on s'evalua el que has aconseguit durant la partida. La Font més important de punts és, sens dubte, els nobles, seguits de les batalles i, en última instancia, la puntuació final.

Óptim per 3-4 jugadors, a 5 es torna molt caòtic i, a 2 no hi ha gaire interacció. La fase de lleis, tot i ser interesant, queda una mica descafeinada, ja que la influencia que té és menor del que es podria pensar. D'altre banda, la rejugabilitat sembla bastant limitada, ja que l'única variació que hi ha entre partides és l'ordre en el que surten les cartes de batalla i, a més, surten totes...

Lancaster initially struck me as a very nasty worker placement game. In a typical worker placement game, the conflict comes from someone taking the spot you want because they have a turn before you do. But in this game, the workers (knights) are constantly being displaced by other players knights and squires. In this respect, it functions more like an auction game. A player can "outbid" you by placing a higher-valued knight and using squires to add to his value. On further reflection, I'm not sure it's really nastier than other worker placement games, but it is certainly more interactive. 

The various locations can get you other knights (which start at their lowest value), upgrade the value of existing knights, get you more squires, get you voting cubes, get you coins, or get you banners for your castle (which give you coins/squires/voting cubes/etc. each turn). Each space also has a noble whom you can invite to your table. Nobles increase in point value exponentially the more you have. They also provide voting cubes each turn. Coins are used to buy back captured armies or allow you to take both of the available options on a space when placing your knight there. 

Obviously there are a lot of elements at play, but they work together very well and seem to avoid the "turn in cubes for points" feel that some other worker placement games get sucked into. This game is not so much about building an economic engine (though that is an element) as accounting for the correct value of each space to you. Is it worth outbidding someone for what you will get? It's really intuitive more than calculable and I like that.

The weak point seems to be the "war" with the French. As competing English knights, players will vie for the various spots on the board, simply displacing their fellow knights. But when going to war, knights can actually be captured and have to be ransomed back. So far so good. Unfortunately, this "war" is nothing more than sending the correct value of knights to get victory points. In fact, it is more about players competing with one another to send the most knights to the war and thus get more points. That element seems un-thematic. In general, the war becomes a catch-all for knights with no other spaces to go to. France is never actually a threat, and players seem to fight each other more than the French. I wish this aspect had been developed a bit further to create a real sense of tension and risk that a war should. As it stands, it seems to just be a place to send knights with nothing else to do.

Lancaster is a game that I could see having broad appeal. It plays in a short time and is pretty intuitive for those with any type of strategy game experience. It does a good job of letting you feel immediate results of your choices, and delivers the typical worker placement tension of "too many things to do and not enough workers." It's a good game, but nothing earth-shattering.

A rather brain-burning bidding game (some would say worker placement, but in practice, it's more like Amun-re or Nefertiti style bidding).  Since the game is only five turns long, there is quite a bit of tension to each turn and it's quite a trick to make everything work out.  Deeply interactive and quite thoughtful. (2-3 plays)

Very unique euro-ish game with a very cool and interactive worker placement mechanic. It's not a first come, first served like in most other euros but there are additional layers in which workers of higher level can take the place of previously placed workers of lower levels by other players. The game also has a voting mechanic which adds a thrilling phase to the game.

My group has some AP tendency on this game. The game structure makes me believe it's a 60-90mins game from any perspective, but we usually take 2hr... Maybe there is too much choice of a single knight...? Also, a player with fewer knights has clearly less participation in the game.

Despite my group's AP problem, It's simple and elegant game, well crafted. Mechanics side has novelty value. The voting is fresh, and the level-up system is nice. Other parts are somewhat normal but well integrated. My only complaint on design is usually lacking a good enough climax (which may have one when everyone gets a strength 4 knight, but that's not always happen.)

Formidable! Uno de mis juegos favoritos. WP es posiblemente mi mecanismo preferido. Cada jugador representa un señor buscando ganarse el favor del rey durante la época de Enrique V, previo al periodo de la Guerra de las rosas entre los Lancaster y los York. Como típico worker placement, aquí debes colocar tus caballeros en provincias para adquirir benificios pero con el caveat de que tus oponentes pueden expulsarte de los lugares si usan caballeros más fuertes que el tuyo. En este juego, genialmente, puedes upgrade tus caballeros. Además debes prestar atención a tu castillo porque mientras más desarrollado lo tengas mejores benificios y recompensas te dará durante cada ronda.

Lancaster is an enjoyable game with good production value. I would characterize it as a point salad worker placement game. Lancaster has a pleasant harmonious composition of gameplay mechanics that features very little downtime between turns and good set of interesting choices. Somehow, the pasted on theme works with the knights and squires and lord tiles we are competing to have eat at our feasts; The theme informs me what I am trying to accomplish. While there isn't a story being told as the game is played, the actions I choose from make thematic sense. Lancaster is an uncommon worker placement game: whereas most worker placements allow the first player to choose a work area and exclude subsequent players, Lancaster permits stronger workers (knights) to displace weaker knights, thus usurping the action opportunity for the round and returning the weaker knight to the offended player for re-placement elsewhere. Thus, the worker placement has a different flavor. I enjoy Lancaster and look forward to exploring the game with more plays. 8/10

Worker placement, has nice enough depth to it, medium weight play that encourages you to interfere with other players but not to the point that it breaks the game or destroys their strategies (just enough of an eye gouge to crawl ahead in points).  Very sound mechanics, easy to understand, and logical with lots of variety in actions allowing endgame strategies to be quite different.

Lovely intermingled web of a problem. Not only do you have to come up with an optimum move, but then think about the order you do it in and with which strength of knight you do it with as getting right can open up a little combo that gets you extra stuff. Plus other players can disturb your plans. Reminded me of Terra Mystica, but with a better theme.
It takes a bit of effort to untangle the rulebook, but once you have very straightforward and fun to play.

Fantastically built worker-placement game.  The game itself seems perfectly balanced, with points coming from several directions (but not too many that you lose track of who's winning) and it offers a few different paths to victory.

I really like the squire mechanic (where you can bolster your strength with disposable units).  The fact that the players keep their squires and money hidden really keeps you on your toes, and can allow players with weaker units to take some key strategic points.  The law mechanic and the battles with the French are really nicely thought out, and don't seem tacked on (as these extra bits sometimes do).  The battles in particular offer a nice way to take valuable resources without risking much confrontation.  As a result, I think this is a fairly family friendly worker placer, your main units can't be 'killed' by the other players and it's also fairly quick to play.  Highly recommended!

Yes its another nothing new worker placement/auction Euro game in a huge batch of similiar games, and it loses points for that, but I think it came out fairly well overall. 

Theme is ok for a euro, in that its there and mostly makes sense but it’s a pure euro albeit note with pretty high interaction (some musical chair Amun-re stuff going on) and VERY tight actions.  Lots of ways to score and things to keep an eye on, typical you need and want everything and will never get it with only 5 rounds. 

Probably best with 5 (most competitive) though there can be a little downtime, 4 should be pretty good too and quicker, can't see 2 or even 3 being that great.  Seems to be the right amount of luck for the length, and the only real luck is in the voting so just in the one area of the game. A decent one hour light middle weight (Kennerspiel? ah boy they sure diluted their own awards putting this and 7 Wonders as anything but regular SDJ candidates...why even have 2 awards?) euro with lots of options and a few ways to approach it, if your looking for that this seems to be a good choice.

Fine game with a slight twist to standard worker placement. It seems like the nobles are basically necessary to do well, which means that early castle upgrades (in particular the money one) are very powerful. I think my biggest concern is that it seems like you can do almost everything in one game, so the games should largely play out very similarly. I also worry about people getting early upgrades being at too big of an advantage.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (June 2016)

Matthias Cramer is a designer I respect a lot. I love Helvetia but I dislike Rococo so I wasn’t sure what to expect. It was a surprise to me to see Lancaster so well ranked, I have never even heard of it before I bought it but I’m happy to report Lancaster is a good game and perhaps a very good one (I need more plays to verify).

The core rules are very easy to explain. It took me (by timer) 12 minutes to read them but it took me over 30 minutes to explain the game along with all the laws, extension and combat tiles. I think, next time I can explain the whole game under 20 minutes. Gameplay is around 2 and half hours.

You need at least 4 players to really enjoy the game. I feel that with 3 or less players the game loses a lot because you need competition for the county spots and negotiation for votes in the laws´ phase.

The theme is ok, but what I really like is that I do (somewhat) feel it through the game, Some game mechanisms support it very well (the strength of the knights and the squires, the laws, the castle extensions).
 
The game components are ok although I heavily dislike stickers sheets ( a Queen Games´ staple) and Lancaster have a lots of stickers. The art is ok.

When I read the rulebook, a friend asked me if Lancaster was a negotiation game and I said no, but after playing it, I had to change my mind. In our game, before passing each law, there was a heated discussion and players made agreements to stop other players, it was a blast, so Lancaster DO have lots of negotiation.

The decisions needed to play the game are hard and tense, there are lots of interesting choices (should I play a knight in the county? If so where and at what strength? Do I need a noble tile? Should I fight for England? Should I try to get an advantage from the current laws or should I try to replace them? Should I play a knight at the castle?). Player interaction is very high, not only you have to negotiate a lot, you can displace or be displaced by your opponents so knowing how many squires to play is also hard. Besides each player has very limited and (some) hidden resources so there is a memory element I LOVE. Money is very tight.

I don’t have anything negative to say about the game. Perhaps I would have liked Lancaster more if it had more Laws as you always play each game with the same set of laws and you have to shuffle them in sequence so the same laws appear, more or less, at the same time each game. I’m not sure if it is hugely repayable (but my gut feeling says it is, besides there are an expansion that addresses this issue and I already have it).

Bottom line, Lancaster is a good worker placement game and a keeper for me. It has simple rules, but the game is very deep! I enjoy it a lot and I want to play it again soon. It was a surprise to me because, for some reason, I don’t hear any talking about Lancaster, however, it is very well ranked and it deserves it.

One of 2011´s favorites.

A really solid game with a clever twist on worker placement.  The values on your knights matter and there are many spaces that require a higher level knight to be able to go there.  You have to constantly be upgrading your knights to expand your possibilities.  Plus you can kick other knights out, which is cool.

Normally I'd run a mile from complex worker placement Euros, my least favourite genre due to their lack of interactivity and tendency towards analysis-paralysis. 

This one's better than most in that it is very interactive, but (especially in the later game) it does drag due to the dread A-P as players try to predict what everyone else will  do in the drive to screw the last few VPs out of the engine - which is what a lot of these games boil down to.

2014-11-29 - I was pretty sure I was going to enjoy Lancaster, but I was surprised by just how much I did. There are so many things to consider during the game, and all of them interesting. I've only played one game with 4 people, but we all had a lot of fun, and are looking forward to playing more.

2017-11-06 - I still enjoy this game, but the mediocre 2 player experience, along with it falling very flat with my regular group means it just won't get to the table very often.

I liked this.  Theme works well and it moves fast.  The laws work well.  I don't like the hidden trackable money and squires - get rid of the castle shields.  Also, I don't like the points at the end.  Preferred:  Each castle piece is worth 2 points.  Each squire is worth 1 point at the end.  Each money is worth 0.5 points at the end.  Each knight is worth points equal to its rank.  Simple, with far less scope for min/maxing and severe analysis paralysis.  
-------------------------------
Update.  Two games in and I think I'm done.  Its a decent game.  Its pretty short.  It gets the job done.  Its unengaging.  The design question here is how much thematic abstraction do you have before it becomes just another min/max VP exercise - I think this has gone too far.
-------------------------------
Update:  Three games in and I am definitely gone.  I stink at the game and I just don't get it.  Very tactical.  Hidden trackable information run wild.

Well designed but it could use a little more excitement.

It's a worker placement game, where the actions involve getting more workers, getting better ones, collecting assets that accumulate points, and alternatively placing them in a separate area for scoring opportunities.  The gimmick is that you can basically pay to bump other workers (a little reminiscent of League of Six), thereby getting into a bidding war to control what you need to do.

Update - the excitement is there.  Bumped from 7 to 8.  There are plenty of difficult decisions in finding the best upgrade path, and adapting as your opponents kick you around.  Oodles of interaction.  The voting system also adds interaction, not only in the vote itself, but in planning a strategy that prevents you from always being in the minority.

RATING: 5
Lacking in 'game space' i get the impression that this well produced game will prove to have approximately 4-5 plays in it before it becomes repetative. Ultimately the game presents you with choices, but really i feel like i'm just shuffling options into a different order rather than crafting a strategy as the game is funnelled into a small design space for viable strategies of which there are maybe 2 or 3.

Lancaster basically is an area control game set in medieval England where controlling an area helps you building up your engine of knights and abilities with a worker placement mechanic to determine area control. There are further systems added on, e.g. a voting on laws similar to that in Cuba or external conflicts in France which are vaguely comparable to the conflicts in Troyes.
All these mechanisms combine smoothly into a Eurogame for gamers that like to have some direct conflict and engine building. Not my favourite especially as it lacks a restricting topographical component which I prefer in games with conflict. But there's no discussion that it's well designed.

So far i really like the game. Playes quick, nice theme and easy to teach. I was a little shocked by Queen Games having me "Add my own stickers to the wooden pieces". Not sure how long they will last and it was a tedious job getting them spot on. If they don't peel component wise this game is beautiful and very robust. If the stickers peel... well i'll wait and see :)

12 Plays in -> The game jumped from 8 to 9 for me. Really getting into the multiple ways to score and unique way of planning ahead. Components are very hardy. Highly recommend this one. (For 3+ player) the two player is a little combersome.

A worker placement/bidding game based on the England-France war. Players take knights and place them on the board for various rewards which are eventually converted to VPs.

The game is pretty dry. There is hardly any theme, and it pretty much boils down to getting more knights, voting cubes or squires. Even the voting for laws was very abstract. Aside from the fantastically over-produced components, this game doesn't really do much for me.

A thematically interesting and well built game that combines relatively quick playing time, good looks and an interesting combination of mechanisms into the same package.

Not superb, but definitely worth taking a peek at.

One of my favorite worker placements because of the twists on the genre: three different types of action spaces, each with their own rule set, different workers, bumping, multi-action spaces, and the law system. I love how the law system makes the game so different based on the number of players: looking for a majority means that in 2P, it's a very tactical thing; with 3, keeping your cubes for an important votes might be enough; with 5, it becomes much more about the will of the majority.

Pretty cool worker placement game. You plays as a noble English family during some medieval time. And of course you're fighting the French.

2017-04-20 - 7,5 - Definitely the best with four - you can feel it especially in the parliament phase. I'm afraid it might get repetitive after more plays, but I have my New Laws and Reward tokens to try. I really like this game, although I slightly prefer others I rated with 8, so half point down..

Fun worker place game where knights can kick out other nights.  Good theme tie in with the conflicts.  The parliament and laws add a nice feature where players can vote on scoring criteria.  I like it though I'm not crazy about the placement round later in the game which goes on and on as people kick other people out back and forth - it seems like there should be a limit to the amount of times a place can be retaken.  Finally, I'm not sold on the two-player version.

3 plays in, and I am still having fun.  So I've raised my rating from 6 up to 7.  I don't think this is ever going to be a favorite, but it's getting a bit better for me, which is a hopeful sign.

In my opinion the war rewards are huge.  There are several choices within the game that seem viable.  Go for lots of knights?  This gives you move moves, and the end-of-round tempo advantage.  Develop your castle? This gives you a solid base to work from and some end-of-game rewards.  Chasing personalities down is another huge lever.  If you allow someone to get them all, that may be a game winning maneuver.

Lancaster is certainly a handsome, well made game.  it is a pleasure to handle the game materials.  Many of my local friends seem quite taken with thes game, so i expect to be playing it ocassionally - and so far, I am okay with that.

Lancaster doesn't offer anything really new, but it does have a very clean game design and, in my opinion, a very good arc. It is worker placement at its core with players needing to switch over from engine building to victory points at the appropriate time. The resolution order is also important due to certain upgrades changing the balance of power in the conflicts. Set collection (in the form of noblemen) adds an interesting decision element due to limited availability of each type (# of players - 1) and they can’t be ignored since they score such large points at game end.  The conflict part of the game adds a dash of co-op elements with seemingly appropriate incentives given for joining a battle later balanced against a more limited selection of bonus tile options. The displacement mechanic in the Counties is another interesting feature since it can bring a player who has already placed all of their knights back into the round. This can be used very effectively. One part of the game I am still working on are the law cards. With every card in play (just the order being random) knowledgeable players will certainly play with these in mind. The difficulty of this is, in almost all cases, you still need at least one other player to have similar incentives so that the law passes (or fails). 1 player against 2 or more has little hope of passing (or failing) a law. Also, since laws are resolved first, the game state from the prior round will mostly determine incentives, so players need to be familiar with what is coming up. Another positive is that 4 player games have played relatively fast – between 60-80 mins – which is great for this game weight. Plays best with 4-5 (4 being my favorite).

My primary concern with the game is the limited path to victory. With equally experienced players, I could see the game coming down to the few random or hidden elements it contains. 

Update (7/25/11): After 10 plays, my initial enthusiasm has certainly subsided. A few concerns I had regarding the game have been confirmed. I feel it only plays well with exactly 4 players: the # of options available are too many with less than 4 and too few with more. Options during the game are very limited and although the path to victory may be slightly different for each player, the goal is very similar. This has caused me to become seemingly bored with the mechanics. Now becoming familiar with the laws, playing with them in mind is certainly advantageous, but if others are not, it still becomes difficult to get them passed if you are the only one prepared. The displacement in the Counties appears to be much less due to defensive maneuvering but rather due to cheaper opportunity cost. Overall, still a fine game, but one I am less inclined to suggest going forward.

Felt like it was missing something. The early rounds were more fun but as we gained more knights (workers) the board got too congested and the last round took almost as long as all the previous rounds  put together with not enough places to use. As a result the last round was more frustrating and annoying than tense.

Wow, it's quite a smash.  Worker placement with overbid & attrition, set collection for the nobles, area control for the battles, board buildings with the upgrades, voting & politics for the laws.  That probably sounds like an overwhelming mash-up but Lancaster pulls it off without even breaking a sweat.  Flows very well, good depth, super interesting & non-destructive player interaction.  This game will keep going up as more people rate it...  impressive stuff.

RATING: 7
Excellent first impression after a five player game.  Not sure I would want to play with less than four as this game gets more enjoyable with more competition over the spots for placing knights.  Several different viable paths to victory appear viable.  Build up your castle to get minor free actions, send knights to locations to power up something or send them to battles for points and other potential benefits.  Nobles score like st. Petersburg and if someone gets a lot of them, they might prove difficult to beat.  Laws add an interesting twist to either benefit certain situations or grant other ways of scoring points.  Everyone gets at least one vote but more votes can be obtained.

I really enjoyed this. I think I stood a good chance but in my first game I let one of my knights die and I reckon it cost me being in the running to win.

 I thought this would be a game I would like.... medieval theme and area control mechanics?  Sign me up!
Boy, was I wrong.  I got off to a bad start.  I erroneously thought that getting more knights would be better because it would give me more options.  I started the game by generating a few level 1 knights.  Unfortunately this meant that I could easily be displaced by my opponents stronger knights which made my guys worthless for controlling land.  This game encourages beating up on the weakest player (which was me when I played it) since they are an easy target and can be displaced.  So I got reamed early and often and it was not fun.  I don't like games that encourage this.  The blind voting in this game isn't really that good either.  The votes are pretty obvious and if one law benefits only you, you can throw everything at it and still lose pretty easily since no one else will want it.  Kind of pointless.

First impression after one 4p game with all expansions.  I cannot express an opinion about the basic game alone since I only played it with the expansions that make some significant changes to the gameplay.  First of all, the art/style of the game is unattractive to me.  "Average," "mediocre," "uninspired" are good adjectives to describe it.  I would not even use "functional" because the board is arranged in a mediocre way.  So you have to look past appearances and you discover an excellent game.  It is a worker placement that does not feel like a worker placement, which for me is a compliment.  The outbidding mechanism, the competing needs, and the law mechanism make this a very interactive and dynamic game with ample opportunities to interact with other players.  I feel negotiation would not be out of place.  The fact that it ended when I was ready to play one more round is a sign that it does not overstay its welcome and that it does not feel repetitive.  I don't know how it will stand to repeated plays, but definitely a game I would like to play again.  If only one could reskin it with a more modern and interesting look...

Matthias Cramer does it again. Wonderfully designed game that is much more than just a bidding game. Simple mechanics combined in a tough game to win.  

Maybe the war theme will frighten people away, but that is unnecessary because there is no real fighting in this game. Only bidding and overbidding.

Nevertheless the theme in this game remains historically relevant.

Minus: 1 (just isn't that much fun with 2 or 3)

Hard to judge after a single game, because I fell into the trap of not recruiting new knights early on, which left me with far too little options in the final rounds.

I suspect this game is better with more than two players, and my rating reflects how it plays as a two-player game. The main board is too open, which takes away the fun and tension of using the squires. The dummy players don't solve this because the only reason to use them on the main board (other than to go to war with France) is to specifically hurt the other player. If you don't like being "mean" to your playing partner, this is a problem.

Lancaster is a pretty cool older Euro game. So 2011 really wasn't that long ago, but Lancaster feels like it was made in the early 90s or something. The components are nice, but basic, as is the artwork. The gameplay is fun, but basic as well. I have to admit that I played Lancaster YEARS after its release, which may have diminished its potential cool factor for me.

Played with three players and the game was rather bland and short. The voting mechanic was compelling and is likely the heart of the game. Judging which laws you can score and how likely they are to pass is intriguing but would likely be better with more players. Board play felt stale. We either had some rules wrong or the game is designed to be enjoyed with 4-5 players to allow for more bumping of workers.

07-16-11 Played a five-player game. The owner warned us Lancaster's language neutral approach left much to be desired, as the icons were not that clear. He handed out some cheat sheets he got off BGG. They helped with the "laws" but little else. I would have liked something that delineated the turn sequence. Sure, there were five cryptic icons purporting to serve that purpose on our castles. But their meaning didn't sink in with me until the game was half over. You certainly get a lot of high quality bits in Lancaster (hence its $65 retail price). And I enjoyed the game, but I'm glad I got to play it without having to buy it. I'll certainly play it again, but I now have no plans to purchase it. It was good, but not as good as I'd hoped. Let's face it, its yet another 
worker placement game. And my game group has played a boatload of those in the last four years. The "bumping" of knights is fun, but my Amun-Re did it first, and did it better, as it sometimes goes on waaaay too long in a five-player game of Lancaster, and makes the game drag.

Excellent Euro, HIghest production I've seen so far with a 3mm box insert.

 Worker placement

Basically you play as upcoming lords in England looking for fame and fortune. The differences are each space you take with your knights can be retaken by others with stronger knights and a 'squire' resource to add strength. So there is a real bidding war to the placement as you strenthen your position across five rounds. There is also a bidding aspect to the game in the form of 'laws' that offten add points etc.

Great Game with many path wasys to victory. But long and very similar to all Euro worker placements. If it had some Theme like writing on the cards "knight Bringham declares etc" it would probably make the top 100

SOLD I have many other less dry worker placements

Cunning worker placement game, where the value of workers can change during the placement phase and almost certainly will later in the turn! 
Rating creeping up because of multiple paths to victory. No chance of multiplayer solitaire, once players are familiar with the mechanics.

Players add influence to the board or into battles to gain favors such as more knights or stronger knights.  You can also fight off the French invasion working with other players.  Each round there is a voting phase where players secretly add votes that gain players points or bonuses based on board locations, etc.  You can add cubes to the vote or save them for later ones.  I'd say it all works well but in the end I left feeling a bit nonplussed.

I was drawn to this game because of its designer and the difficulty in finding it. I enjoyed my single play, at 3p, but want to give it another go at a higher player count. The number of councilmen tiles per county is lower but there is no restriction to the counties themselves, leaving too little competition in knight placement. I think this will be more interesting at 5p.

Terrific game, so happy to have played it a couple of times. It's essentially a worker placement game, with some light conflict and a "political" phase but it all works really well together. The decisions feel very tense and the board is pretty tight with 3 and 4. Also, the physical components are very appealing. I love the wooden blocks, the castle shields, and all of the tiles are top notch. I like Glen More, but Matthias really nailed it with Lancaster.

The things I like about this game are:
There are always some good positions left to place your knights. Even with 5 players it works well.
You can work together with other players to defeat invading armies.
Direct bonuses for sending your knights out to battle.
The player interaction seems just in the sweet spot: you'll be competing other players, but not destroying their knights and castles. 
Building your own castle and army is fun to do. 
Good quality material: wood and thick cards.

The things I don't like are:
I would have liked to see more direct ways to gain victory points during the game. Most victory points are awarded during the end game scoring. You may be having fun upgrading your castle and army, but you'll probably won't realise that this will hardly gain you any victory points.
No it's not fun as a 2-player game.
The drawing style of the box and board didn't appeal to me. The fact that it got an award convinced me to buy the game (fortunately), not the box lay-out.

Overall a good game and unfortunately only a few persons know about this game.

RATING: 8
A very interesting combination of mechanics--worker placement, bidding and voting, engine-building. I like the worker-placement mechanism where you send knights to the counties buffed optionally with little white squires: other players can bump you out, so it can get mean, but since you get your knight back for redeployment it's not a loss (unlike some worker placement games, where there's basically only a few spots you need and the rest are a waste, you can always find something useful to do with your knight--there are 2 different zones on the board plus your own castle where you can place your knight).

The main down side to this game is the horrendous rule set which is full of ambiguities and occasionally buries key rules quite deeply. (Main things: "employed squires" = unused squires behind your screen; you can't stack your knights on county spots, just conflicts; you can't collect duplicate nobles for your castle table, which is why they have individual letters/art. -- Missing the latter rule is particularly damaging given that it ruins the final scoring by making it way too easy to max out nobles.) -- I strongly recommend checking the BGG forums and files to get better rules than the crappy ones out the box, otherwise your first game will be very perplexing.

There are many interesting decisions in Lancaster. You can compete with the other players over the castles or cooperate in wars. You can play solitaire by building your castle or interactive by negotiating which laws should be approved and rejected. It may be a bit too chaotic to anticipate the other players' moves but even this chaos is fun as players keep surprising each other.

Worker placement title that, for me, begs the question, especially given Caylus, Troyes, Louis XIV. Or is it just a bias against Cramer (cf Glen More). There's a ton of AP in the game since placed workers are displaceable and by the end demand for spaces overwhelms supply. The changing goals as exemplified by the upcoming laws provide some interest, and there is something of an arc through the game based on the fact that players accumulate more workers and one's strategy must adapt for that. Still, by the end I found it a workmanlike experience rather than a fun one. Early rounds were more enjoyable as the game began to gel and there were more unoccupied spaces than there was AP.

Compete to be the King's right hand man!  This game allows users to always be doing something useful to build their fiefdom, upgrading worker placement with the concept of workers with varying levels of power.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Worker placement games with lots of decisions, different paths to victory, and several mechanims. Easy to learn, but difficult to master (no really, really difficult, but it's not an easy game for non gamers).

The best features:
-> You can displace workers from other players, to a certain degree. This opens a lot of different posibilities and strategies, different than those from other worker placement games.
-> The law phase is definitly fun!


On the cons... 
·) The last 2 sets of 3 laws give a lot of points, and most likely the game will be quite balanced... These votes can easily decide the winner.
·) The last nobles give a lot of points, and sometimes it is just a question of luck.
·) The 1 hour game is an utopia; with 5 players, it's around the 2 hours mark.
·) You always get the same laws, on the same turns (more or less). Besides the lack of diversity, this allows you to create set strategies (again, to a certain degree, because you can be displaced) and, most important, this knowledge can be used for great benefit by those who know what laws will come next.

Worker placement with a tacked-on voting mechanic to attempt to deal with runaway leader issues.  My main problem with the game?  It's theme-heavy, yet so many elements make no sense.  The board implies a certain amount of geography, so where are the players' castles?  Floating in the sky?  Are we beaming our knights down into the counties, kidnapping aristocrats and bringing them back to our aerial fortress?  A snooze-fest with theme issues.  Yawn.

I don't know why, but I convinced myself this would be difficult to learn and teach. Consequently, it has been sitting on a shelf for months. Happily, I was mistaken: Lancaster really needs a better chart showing sequence of play, but the rules are very easy to manage.

It is brilliant. A mix of Worker placement/Action selection, voting to approve scoring options,and area majority (Conflicts). There are six rounds, and a game is less than an hour once people know the rules. 

Components are very good, although all of Henry V's nobles appear to be having bad hair days. No colourblind problems at all.

Very good game. I played it three times at Dexcon and each game was different. The region knight placement felt like Amun-Re bidding to me, and the castle improvements felt like Endeavor. The only aspect of the game I didn't enjoy was that it can be very difficult to recover if you fall behind early.  There may be ways to do this that I'm not yet aware of. I also wish there were more end-scoring options.  But it's a very good game and worth trying out. And I really like the components.

遊戲的得分機制說實話都是在互動搶分
不管是行動格的搶人或是搶貴族
或是衝突卡的解決
投票部分雖然有趣，不過有時候還蠻好預測結果
大家想要的都會過，不想要的要獨排眾議應該也不容易
只能說這是跟三人以上較適合的遊戲(人多卡一點才會有競爭的樂趣)
不過不適合我們家的和平發展玩法
規則:
*每位玩家起始兩個騎士(一個1一個2)，一個投票標記，錢跟隨從各兩個(隱藏資訊放在屏幕後)，贊成反對投票標記一對，選一個擴張版塊放在個人城堡版塊上，其他五個蓋著
*法律卡照背面各疊洗混，在照數字疊起來(1在上面)，0的三張放在議會版塊上方，在抽三張1的放在下方，照人數拿貴族版塊(2~3p:2,4p:3,5p:4)隨機放在主圖版上(同樣數字的疊在一起)，衝突卡抽掉兩張(2,4p:2+10,3p:9+10, 5p:2+3)，在抽兩張放在上面衝突區
*遊戲進行五輪，每輪有三個階段
1: Place knights
玩家輪流放工人到場上
A城市 騎士等級要大於城市需求，踢別人騎士時，可用隨從來增加騎士等級，被踢的騎士之後可以在放，隨從在收回騎士時才清掉，如果是被趕走隨從就棄掉
B城堡 就只有自己能放，等級沒差
C衝突 放衝突卡左邊最上面的格子(每個人只有一格，可以疊上去)，隨從無用，騎士一放就獲得國王賞賜，選完後就蓋著
2: Parliament
照順序投票表決議會版塊下面的三個法律(左到右)，每個人秘密決定贊成或反對還有要不要加上額外投票標記，在一起攤開，總合所有贊成反對跟額外標記數目，平手算贊成，通過的法律把最左邊的踢掉，三個投完就根據目前的法律或得好處
3: Rewards
A 城市 由A~H順序結算，決定要拿貴族或是下面的好處，或是付三塊錢都拿，結算完騎士拿走，隨從棄掉，I城市的騎士可決定誰成為下輪起始玩家
B 城堡 有擴展版塊，跟放騎士的位置獲得好處，每一個貴族或得一個投票標記
C 衝突 先結算下方衝突，戰勝的衝突(大於等於)照貢獻度得分數，平手下方的贏，後面名次的分數不會往前加，第一次輸的衝突依舊照名次記分，不過全部分數順位後移一位，然後下放，第二次輸的話也可同失敗記分，但是要付贖金等於騎士等級，否則騎士就走了
*開新的衝突版塊，跟法律版塊，國王賞賜翻回來
*第五輪結束時，貴族不會拿投票標記，最後記分，騎士力量總和最高的+8分，第二+4分，平手就把隨從加進來比，城堡最多擴展+8分第二+4，平手比金錢(如果第一依然平手，把12平分，如果第二平手把4平分)，貴族版塊記分
**兩人遊戲
四人規則，每個人選一個同盟，同盟起是一個1一個2，放騎士時可選擇放自己或是同盟的，同盟不能+自己的隨從，自己不能趕同盟的騎士，同盟得到貴族是移出遊戲，每個貴族只使用兩個，同盟不會得到會議好處，衝突記分，同盟算是其它玩家，遊戲最後記分第二名沒分。

I'd heard it was a worker placement game, so my expectations were low. It was better than I expected, but still not very good. It has a lot of mechanics packed into it, but many of them I didn't like:
*Worker placement. It's not as bad as true worker placement, because players can kick each other out provided they have a strong enough worker (or pay resources), so it's more like an auction like Cargo Noir, however it's a bad kind of auction, where losing bidders often still lose part of their bid.
*Blind bidding
*Doing stuff because a card has been randomly turned over this turn that says you get points if you meet these arbitrary conditions. :snore:
*Hidden but trackable information
There are some good aspects but they are outweighed by the bad

As one friend said, "It's not about placement, but timing." Lancaster is a genuine good time because it encourages player interaction at every turn in a seemingly "boring" Euro context. The game is a wonderful blend of auction mechanics and basic resource gathering, with players voting on "laws" that score points for anyone who meet the conditions. Knights are not seen as workers, but rather "bids," or units that can be "powered up" by other resources or placed elsewhere if you can't exceed another player's knight's power. And there is a hint of cooperation when it comes to the War with France portion of the board, requiring more than one person to complete them for points. It's a great and variable strategy game, with AP being the cost for all these fantastic mechanics; player's turns can be long and drawn out. But overall, Lancaster is a great twist on the genre. A joy to play.

A worker placement game in the search for victory points over 5 rounds. The first few rounds are typically spent competing for the 10 spots that gives powers and/or aristocrats, or getting in first on the battle spots, in order to get more workers, get more powerful workers, and build an engine to generate money and bidding booster power. No worker is safe though as it can get bumped off its spot by more powerful workers. The latter rounds are spent converting your engine into worker points, via collecting aristocrats for scoring a la St Pete, through voted-in-law laws a la Cuba or placing the most powerful workers in the area majority sphere (called battles here in an attempt to get that theme working for you). With all the bumping off and consequent re-placing, the latter rounds seem interminably long though and took the shine off what seems an ok Euro that's a clean enough design. It's got some play as you try different approaches (different income generation, aristocrats vs nobles). If a leader emerges mid-game, there might be a rich-get-richer thing going on. Not one I'm racing back to, but would be fine exploring a bit more.

What I like:
- Nice components

What I don't like:
- I *hate* the semi-all-pay auctions
- Blind voting for laws
- The last round really drags; very AP prone
- Too much confrontation for my tastes
- Quite thinky--a bit over my threshold
- Majorities in the battles with France

Lancaster seems like a very well-crafted game. But it is built around a series of mechanics that I just don't like. Losing your squires when you bid them is really irritating. The congested board is annoying. The majorities in conflicts are frustrating, especially since ties go to whoever got there last. I'm not fond of blind bidding (as in the law voting).

It is too confrontational with 3p, and I can only imagine the bloodbath in a 5p game.

It's also longer than I like (130 minutes after setup for a 3p game). It has some of the sequential planning of Caylus, but is very open-ended so is overwhelming at first (and remains thinky even after you know it). The weight is well above the BGG-voted 2.9. I'll give it a 3.3.

Not good with 2 because it has mechanics that are like auctions. 2p requires using a second set of knights as "allies", with limits on how you can use them. Ugh.

A worker placement game, where your workers are knights and can get stronger as to displace others and have more influence in battles. There are a few things that you can use your knights to do and the first play, although the mechanics are fairly straight forward, it has a small learning curve. It plays in only an hour (once you know the game) and is lots of fun, as there are not too many options for knight placement. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A worker placement game with a healthy dose of interaction and confrontation.  Because knights (workers) have strength values, knights of lower values can be knocked off spaces.  Squires (a form of currency actually) can be added to knights to solidify their position and make it more expensive for opponents to push them off the space.  Hence, the game combines the worker placement mechanic with an auction mechanic.  There are not many viable paths to victory here which may dismay players who need multiple paths to victory for purposes of replay value.  However, adding more paths to victory in this game would discourage the confrontation which makes this game shine.  More paths to victory encourages finding the path of least resistance which is not what this game is supposed to be.  

UPDATE:  I stand by my favorable description, but I ended up selling the game anyway.  Shelf space is limited and sometimes decent games get jettisoned to make room for games that might get played more.  I just wasn't getting to play Lancaster very often.

Lancaster is a very interesting take on worker placement, featuring workers of differing strengths that can displace workers of lower strengths.  Some actions have worker strength requirements, and others (France) give you bonuses based on your total strength.  There's a lot of back-and-forth in this game, and it's always interesting to see where everything lands once the dust settles.  There's also a lot of intricate interplay between money, actions, votes, noble chips, castle upgrades, and straight-up victory points; everything just tied together really well.  This one is a bit of a brain-burner, but it has tons of strategic options and lots of ways to excel.

What was essentially a nice, lightly themed worker placement game was blown out of the water with the addition of the Henry V expansion.

Where as before players could ignore the wars in France with no fear of the Kings retribution, now players are punished and have to sacrifice knights to the tower of London if they don't aid the King in his noble quest to take back his rightful throne.

Whilst previous games devolved into who could get the most nobility around their table for the end of game scoring-fest, now players will find themselves desperately jostling each other out of various titled offices. Bishops will be appointed and ousted and whole new musterings of archers and tudor knights will emerge to affect other players carefully laid plans.

It may still look like the same pleasant pastelle coloured abstracted game it was before but now it feels firmly rooted in the dark & turbulent times of the medieval period. Blood and gold will flow in equal measures. As just the base game it's a weak willed, turnip eating peasant, add in Henry V and it's a fully armoured, Dual sword wielding, psychopathic knight!

TRY Oct/11 - interesting game, 4-players.  Felt that knowledge of the laws make this difficult for new players to be competitive, but that's true of many games with depth.

It always felt like there was something to be doing; never just moving pieces, but always trying to compete.

We found huge advantages to simply getting extra turns (more knights, even if small).

Our experience was definitely longer than the '60 minutes'; more like 1 3/4 hrs.

I thought this was a decent interactive worker placement game.  I liked focusing on the castle upgrades and using the stronger knights or knights with squires to kick out other players in a spot.  I liked the one-upping for the foreign wars as well.  The voting for laws had an interesting twist to the game and increased player interactivity as well.  The game moved pretty quickly with little downtime.

The noble scoring seemed too powerful and controlled the ending.  The game also doesn't appear to scale well for 2-3 players.  I also thought the game turns were a tad fiddly, especially with the law voting.

An attractive worker placement game, seemingly with lots of victory point scoring options and a parliament that votes on 'new laws' that introduce in-game variants. The scoring for collecting a full set of nobles appears to dwarf other scoring options tho'. Nevertheless, this is an attractive game with a strong theme and good interaction.

It seems like there is a lot going on in this game, but Lancaster flows so smoothly and plays so quickly with a ton of fun decisions.

This game is an absolute treasure !!

One of my favorite games of all time. The game feels very thematic and it has a lot of player interaction, which is something that most typical euro games lacks.

There is a ton of tension in this one, pacing and conflict. The laws system is a fantastic mechanic... Absolutely brilliant and clever !! The blind bidding is something very interesting and a bit similar to Strasbourg. It adds to the depth of the game and brings even more tension to the players.

I absolutely love the game... Everything you do makes sense and the strategy & complexity level is on par with most other top euro games out there.

Rules are simple to understand (for a euro game), but how deep and hard to master !!

This game is what a real euro game should be !! Absolute perfection !!

Pleasant game. From the rules it's a mess of mechanics, but in actuality it's a nice, smooth package. It's one of those games that are shorter than you think and where you quickly find out you can't do everything. There's a pleasant level of competition; you can choose to fight with the others over the most valuable spots, or pick whatever is left over without fighting, and both seem viable options.

I've read comments that Lancaster isn't very innovative, but I disagree. Normally bidding and worker placement are very different answers to the "two players want something; who gets it?"-question (The one who pays most vs. the one who picked first), but Lancaster combines it. In theory it's bidding, but in practice placing first is almost as good and you don't have to pay to displace someone, which is risky. Combine this with workers of different levels and different level requirements for different spots and the choice of going for more workers or higher level workers or money/squires to get more out of your workers and it's a new twist at the very least. Voting for laws adds another layer as well.

A pleasant surprise.

Short worker placement game with a fun mechanic of having the ability to displace their workers with your stronger worker. Of course this means they get to reassign their displaced worker where it could make you sad. The tension of having to decide if you want to spend to punt your opponent when doing so could cause you to be punted from another of your placements is nothing more than thrilling.

If using the new laws expansion, it's important to the game that there be the correct number of laws. Since getting the expansions, I've gotten the number of laws wrong more than once, although I'm not sure how. I know someone will call me dumb, but I can't help but think the whole thing could use some extra clarity. I'd also love it if the war tiles that are only meant for a certain number of players, be indicated so on the tiles themselves so I don't accidentally shuffle them in.

Didn't look like my sort of thing (I'm not generally a fan of worker placement) but I found it surprisingly enjoyable. The rules are super smooth, there's not too much cube-churning and a decent amount of interaction. I'm not sure it's even worker placement really - more like an Amun-Re-style auction with multiple (and upgradable) bidding chips per player.

Perhaps my rating is a little harsh but in light of the myriad of excellent area control games already out there, this one falls way short. First, it has nothing new to offer for area control, just a different blending of existing games. Second, although it flowed fine and seemed to move, in the end your actions are quite limited. Again, it becomes a straight excercise of efficiency. The thing that killed the game for us was the drawn out last round, which took almost as long as the first 4 rounds. That was only with 4 players, I can't imagine how much longer it would have been with 5. By the end I couldn't care less who won, I just wanted it over with so we could move on to another game.

An area control game that works well with 4-5 players. The game is only 5 rounds long but the constant jostling with more players knocking each other out of spots will cause the game to drag occasionally. It's a pretty brutal game, and I'd imagine it's less tight with two players. Everyone's resources are hidden behind their player screen so it makes it difficult to know how strong other people are. The voting system is pretty neat and allows for players to form alliances. It's an okay game, but one that I'll doubt I'll play again since it works less well at 2 players.

A worker placement iteration that veered kind of close to bidding/auction, and that was compelling. It also had a set of Laws that governed/constrained each round, and you all voted on which ones were in play. So there was a lot going on that was dynamic and not just straight, algorithmic sequencing as in a lot of other procedural worker placement games. It was interactive! On a shared map! And the individual player board (your castle) was really more of a consolation prize than a balanced strategy, so the focus was kept out in the shared space. This one was different, and neat, and I wanted to play it more. 

Unfortunately I was the only one in my social orbit who felt this way, and so after a few years of hope, my tank ran out of fumes. It got sold and no one has talked about since. It's too bad. I don't know if this one would have stood up to 15 plays, but it was worth a few to find out.

I like so much this game.

RATING: N/A
Pros:
* Great production quality.

Cons:
* Lacking something for 2 players.
* Everything I liked about this game was done better by Keyflower.

Neutral:
* Base game feels like it would lack replayability thanks to every conflict and law card coming out in every game. Fortunately, there are expansions that resolve that.

Comparisons to other WP games I've played:
* I prefer Lancaster to Caylus. Lancaster felt a bit more forgiving/tactical when someone interrupts your plans. I also liked the limited selection of recourses you collect in the game (money, squires, votes) and how there's very little multi-stage transformation of resources ("three X gets me two Y. A Y and one Z gets me an N. I need one N and two X to build B ...")
* I strongly prefer Keyflower to Lancaster. One of the key features for me in Keyflower is how you get all of your meeples back when you get booted. The penalty is having to spend them all at once. In Lancaster, you lose your squires if you get booted. I also liked the imbalance of tiles in Keyflower where some tiles were obviously worth more to one player than another making it more fun to drive the price up on something. In Lancaster, at least with 2, the cost of driving the price up on something is too high and even if you drove up the price on something the other player wanted, he could probably just get it from somewhere else instead. In our first (and only) play of Lancaster, we only had one instance where someone strategically paid more than he needed to for something.

Caveat: We got a major rule wrong. We thought the four spaces on your player board were for the only four knights you were allowed to have. Between that and not really grokking the allies rules until it was too late, we had too few knights in play and therefore very little conflict for spaces on the board.

Summary: probably would have been a much better game with correct rules; however, I don't envision many situations where I'm in the mood for a game like this and I wouldn't chose Keyflower instead. Don't need to keep both.

= 2014-12-14

All of my comments are from a single 2 player game. This is neither enough plays to really grasp the game nor is it a recommended number of players. As such, I'm just going to provide my first impression but no rating.

I played one learning game of this last night. We said we were just going to do a couple rounds "semi randomly", figure out what's important in the game and then start over. As in every other case where we've said that, we ended up not starting over so it's fair to say that our first few turns were somewhat chaotic and suboptimal. We also got a major rule wrong (thought you could only have a max of four knights).

The voting for laws was kind of dull for 2. I could see the diplomacy of a four or five player game really improving things.

Lancaster has the appearance of a confrontstional area control war game, but plays more like a casual workwr placement set collection game. That is great for me and the kind of gamers with which I mingle. Bunping another players workers is no big deal, as that player will get those workers back to place again later, possibly even returning to the same spot with a stronger workforce. Keeping a close eye on eachother's forced and timing your big plays right is key. Also, collecting enough votes to ensure you're scoring points for those actions you so cleverly planned. 

Lancaster is another great design from Cramer that squeezes a ton of interesting choices into a medim-light weight game. I can't wait to add in the expansion.

Lancaster is a box full of every trend I dislike about modern games. What a complex, inelegant and ultimately dreary experience! It's just another kludged-together mess of four or five typical mechanics, any two or three of which could be removed with no real effect on the game... except to improve it. 

When I suggested I'd rather see any single phase developed into a game in itself, the guy who brought it to our group admitted, "Well, none of the elements are particularly original..." I guess if your enjoyment of a game hinges on the quantity of unoriginal elements, you'll probably like Lancaster -- it's got shovelfuls. 

I didn't care much about voting for the incomprehensible pictographic laws, which nobody understood and which caused endless debates. My apathy ripened into full-blown loathing when I learned old laws would be repealed whenever new laws pushed them out of the way. 
 
I'm also never keen on what I've taken to calling "secondary forms of currency." The squires in this game are really just another money-like resource, so why tack them onto the game? Just give their powers over to the money (or vice versa) and eliminate a ton of bad code. 

While there were very few smiles, laughs or other signs of enjoyment around the table during play, the rest of the group said they liked it.

I played this with the expansion extras.

This game is a bit like Lords of Waterdeep with about a dozen extras added, which makes it more fun (in my view) but also much more of a headache (see below).

Despite supposedly being 'medium' difficulty, there are a lot of details to consider before each move. And you will make a lot of moves in each round. The game allows you to push enemy workers out of areas and the resulting 'chain effect' is particularly complicated to assess, especially with the Henry V expansion. It can induce massive 'analysis paralysis' if you allow it to.

You will also be trying to memorise what resources players have hidden behind their screens because, for example, there are big victory point penalties for the player who's accumulated the most 'king's resentment' tokens. I find that a chore. Thank goodness the game is quite short - as little as one hour long with fast players.

One additional frustration is that there are a lot of fiddly inconsistencies that you have to remember, especially with the (otherwise fun) expansion. For example converting one resource into another is always something you can do multiple times in a turn ... but oddly NOT if it's done in your castle - even though the icons there are the same. There are several different ways that ties between players are resolved in the game depending on the location.

The game still provides a very good, fun conflict and packs-in a lot of game for its length. Our group likes it. I quite like it too, but I find myself dreading the amount of thought required (weirdly, I find 'heavier' games like Terra Mystica and Kanban much less of a brain-ache). I don't think it has the nuances of those games. Lancaster is more of a scrap.

Once the pain of setting up is over, this is a surprisingly polished medium-weight euro. 

The progression of knight placement, combined with different avenues to success, makes for a tense yet nicely-paced game. The voting mechanism adds some needed interaction and variability. Nobles are clearly important, but the other ways of scoring seem well-balanced.

My wife and I have owned this game for several years (it's one of a bundle of Queen games she got with one of their kickstarter campaigns), but we've never played it - I have though played someone else's copy at our local games club. This was my only play of this so far, in March 2015. I actually really enjoyed it, and am quite close to giving it an "8" rating - I've held off just because, despite be liking the game, I'm not in a rush to play again and wouldn't automatically choose it if there were other good games on offer. But I found the game very interesting in several aspects - the voting, the system for knocking other players out of the counties (including the use of "squires"), getting new knights vs upgrading old ones, and how much to devote to fighting the French. I do look forward to discovering more about the strategic possibilities in future plays of this.

The voting is interesting but I think it falls short.  I feel like it requires a lot of computation to figure out who will vote which way, for what amounts to only a minor gain most of the time.  A bad ratio of time-for-benefit but enough to tempt players into AP.  Still, it sometimes is quite tense and other times simple enough to compute (and thus fast).

update:  It's all very nice but I just don't care.  Nothing about the game grips me at all.  It works fine and I'm not sure what I'm suppose to be engaged by.  Well, the voting is cool except that it doesn't matter enough.  The blocking is shockingly non-frustrating but that is quintessential damnation by faint praise.

A really good worker placement game where you can upgrade your workers and kick out other players' workers. Once everyone knows the game, it's pretty simple and can play pretty fast, not much over an hour.  Theme is there just enough - the places you put your knights to take an action or gain a noble could have a little more theme to them, but everything interacts pretty well.

RATING: 7.5
Area control and worker placement, hasn't this been done to death? Do we really need another one of these games? Those seem like obvious questions to ask when looking at Lancaster. 

During your first turn, when you look at the available options for placing a knight, it can be a bit overwhelming. In fact, that's a good word to describe how I felt during the first half of the game: overwhelmed. It's really difficult to visualize a strategy with so many options on the boards.

The second phase (parliament), adds a unique and novel approach to victory point maximization, one in which players fight for the law that best suit them, but it compounds on the initial overwhelmed feeling by throwing the players into a sea of language neutral icons. It's tough to visualize any kind of strategy when you must constantly consult the reference sheet.

These may seem like criticism, but I think they are basically barriers of entry into a fantastic game experience. This game will not easily give up it's intricacies, and like any other game, knowledge of the components speed up the game and open it up to better strategic and tactical play. 

The rules are surprisingly brief, but the game is packed with meaningful decision. Every knight placed is a game of chicken and second guessing. Every voting cube used is a precious resource used in an attempt to maximize victory points. A game of reacting to other players, and a good one at that.

After just one play, I think that this is a very solid worker placement game.  The options and strategies seem very extense.  Additional plays may expose some pattterns to strategy but thus far it is seemingly well balanced.  Theme is a bit light BUT I still had tons of fun playing beyond the mechanics.

RATING: 7
It's a nice variant on the worker-placement game, but one that's been done before (and with slightly more interest) by Mechanisburgo. 

I don't think there are too many ways to play this one as nobles are always key, and nobles allow law control, so in the end it does boil down to an optomisation problem. 

With two, there are a few more tactical options (using your ally to remove nobles adds to the game - I do often consider adding that rule to the base game).

I'd definately play it, and feel that it's got space in my collection, but it's nothing supremly special.

RATING: 7
The same sort of complexity as Carson City and Endeavor, there's some juicy options to consider on a turn in terms of the order that everything occurs, whether it's more dangerous to bump someone from an area or just leave them where they are, whether you can set up a good combination. Then there's just the general rush to grab the good stuff, which is different for different players. All good fun and not too brain burning.

The individual elements to the game are rather simple and in themselves are nothing particularly special. Together the whole package with lovely components makes for a pleasant and fun gaming experience. There's not a lot of theme, but in the quick Euro class it's got some good player interaction going on and did I mention the nice bits?

The game will play quite differently depending on the number of players. Competition will be rather juicy with five players.

As a whole it's a good game that I'm happy to bring out if it looks like we can play it in just over an hour. It falls just short of an 8 for now, I'll have to try with varied numbers and see if the interest in replaying it is there after a few games. It depends. Especially if we can keep it short and sweet at about an hour it'll have earned an 8 in my book, but early days and it's a solid 7.

The rulebook? Okay... Castle extensions? Plain as mud. Randomly assigning nobles? Huh? What's that about? Do Knights still battling at the end of the game count towards the total knights points? What's this about Dorset? Okay, found it on the summary sheet. Why split rules up between the rulebook and the setup summary sheet? It was a bit of a hunt to piece it all together, but we managed. Still, they could do with a tidying up.

Rules are easily understood in this worker placement/area control game.  It's the subtle nuances and variable paths to victory that make this one shine.  Upgrade your knights quickly to control the higher cost areas without challenge.  Enter into the conflict for the reward tiles.  Upgrade your castle for end of round bonuses.  Any of those are viable options to help you gain Power Points.  

Overall, a very enjoyable game - and one that is easy to get into.

Un juego que le da una vuelta de tuerca al posicionamiento de trabajadores, combinándolo con una puja por cada sitio. Se trata de un juego de peso medio, que parece que tiene muchas cosas en la explicación, pero que luego se juega muy fluido. Los componentes son increíbles y luce precioso desplegado en mesa.

Tiene demasiado impacto en el juego la obtención de los diferentes nobles, no te puedes quedar atrás. Al parecer, esto se palía un poco con la expansión, que propone un par de puntuaciones más al final del juego con tanta importancia como los nobles.

Muy recomendable.

A good area control type of game with some good elements to it.  My first play was with 4p, but I think it would be even more cutthroat with 5p.  I liked my play of it despite the fact that I underestimated the value of lower numbered armies.  I also like the voting as well.  There are a lot of good things here, but I will need additional plays to determine how much I like it.

I've played this just a few times over the years and I don't normally care for 5p games, but this one is really good with 5p.  The tightness feels just right at that count.  I don't need to own it, but I'll always be happy to play it if we are on the odd number at game night.

Lancaster is that breed of euros which is almost different from worker placement. but not quite. The euro version of "all but the kitchen sink" approach, but differs from ameritrash by all the stuff being laid down on somebody's spread sheet that gives out victory points. The good old: restricted number of turns to do restricted amount of many things that give VPs in many different ways.

The good part is that all these pieces actually fit and do work together - in many ways Lancaster succeeds where Cuba failed. But ultimately, it's just some VP spread, with a bit more emphasized blocking if that's the thing that fascinates you the most in worker placement genre. Theme is there but really isn't. Ages of Empires III is a much better game with a similar approach.

Rating down to 1.0 because: uninspired. Yeah it's a crime.

Lancaster is a game which largely flew under my radar – there isn't a lot of buzz for it beyond its high BGG ranking, and the artwork looks unabashedly dull. And yet I was pleasantly surprised when I finally played it. Mechanism-wise, it relies on familiar auction and area control tropes, but these mechanisms mesh together nicely to provide a pleasant and interactive experience. In particular, the placement of knights in counties is an interesting riff off the multi-layered auction system found in games like [thing=26566][/thing]. It generates interesting decisions between spreading low-valued knights in hope of securing as many slots as possible, or focusing high-valued knights on a few choice slots.

The game takes place over a remarkably short 5 rounds, so there is little room for revisions in strategy. The short span of the game also requires players to pay special attention to the sequence of the actions taken – it is easy to confuse say, when you will be able to upgrade a knight or obtain more squires. Make a strategic mistake early on, and you will slip behind irrevocably.

The game seems to play better with high player counts given the interactivity involved.

Strikes the right balance between edgy interaction and laid back worker placement. The theme comes through well but the voting part felt a bit clunky/predictable with 4 players and the knight merry go round, although fun and tense was frustrating at times. Need to get this out again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Worker placement is one of my favorite mechanisms and game genres, so I am typically drawn to any of them with a twist.  The twist in Lancaster is that other players' "workers" can be displaced with ones of higher value.  That makes the placement of a worker more like a bid for that spot since another player can "outbid" you with a higher-valued worker.  This makes for some very interesting interactions between players as they go back and forth one-upping each other for a particular spot.  The other interesting thing about Lancaster is that's not the typical resource gathering - convert - score point games.  Instead, players vote on various "Laws" each round that will pay out rewards in the form of resources or points.  As a result, players are watching each other to figure out what to enact to benefit themselves which to vote down so that their opponents don't benefit.  This is a very interesting mechanism that makes balancing the various strategies tricky.  I like it.  This is a really good tome.  It would be nice to play this more, but my group didn't seem overly interested, so the game will probably end up exiting my collection.

RATING: 8.1
The first round might be boring but once you get more knights, the game ramps up. It plays fast but there's so many decisions. This is the only area control game I own and its because most of them feel very personal. This game there isn't that much hatred or spite in owning an area and that makes it a fun game instead of a "take that" game.

It takes *ages* until all knights are distributed each round. Basically everyone goes to one place, but can be kicked out by a stronger knight again, so he has to go to some other place and kick someone out there himself, who then has to go to some other place too, ... repeat ad nauseam.

Worker Placement. Nice twist/update on worker placement with the fact that your workers (knights) have different strength values. These help win conflicts against France but also determine which knights can displace others during the placement phase; some action spots also have minimum strength value of who can place there (i.e., you can't send Sir Nobody to the castles of the most prestigious nobles). The voting (parliament) system works well and provides one more means of manipulating VP, money, knights, etc.

A worthy SdJ nominee, I think, although there is a little bit more going on than for a gateway game, say, and perhaps why it didn't win.

2011-es esseni játék a jobbak közül. Elsőre bonyolultnak tűnt a szabály és az előkészületek is sokáig tartottak, de kellemes csalódást okozott a társas. Különböző erősségű lovagjainkkal több területet tudunk befolyásolni a nagy és saját táblánkon. Ezek közül van ahonnan kitúrhatnak, de vannak védett helyek is. Sokfajta pontszerzési lehetőség van és a Cubából ismert törvényekről szavazás is megtalálható a játékban. Újdonságot nem igazán tud felmutatni a játék, de jól összegyúrt, szép kivitelű darab. Fix öt körös a játék, ami elsőnek kicsit kevésnek tűnt, de pont jó. A konfliktus rendesen megjelenik a játékban, de érdekes módon valamit biztos lehet szerezni a lovagjainkkal így elfogadhatónak éreztem még számomra is, aki nem kedveli igazán a konfliktusos játékokat. Nem kiemelkedő darab, de egyértelműen tetszett.

15 years ago this would have been a clever innovative design.  Now it just seems like a pleasant, but lightly stirred soup made from all of yesterday's ingredients (engine/worker placement/bidding/area control).

I'm not sure if there are any real strategic decisions.  You want to build your castle so that you can get automatic income and you want to get as many knights out on the board as possible so that you can take the most actions and diversify so that you can take advantage of any upgrade situation.  So knowing that, it is all tactics looking for holes to slip into cheaply to accomplish these goals.  Hopefully, the caprice of other players will not put you into an unfortunate loss, or at the very least in this situation you hope that all other players don't get away with getting what they need entirely for free.

Nothing wrong with it, but in a world with thousands of other games and hundreds of them do the same kind of thing better, I don't have an urge to run back to this.

Maybe I'm now just a curmudgeon of a gamer and there is little that is new and shiny to really entice me, but this game didn't resonate that much with me. It's got kind of an auction feel as you place your knights in different positions and can get them booted out, but I just didn't get the sense that there was anything much that was new and compelling in this one - it's just another worker placement game where you jockey with your opponents for position. It seems pretty darn vanilla to me.

I wouldn't mind playing this again, and I can see why this was nominated; but it's not my favorite at the moment. Of course, I guess that could be because I sucked so badly!

--- Summary ---
Players each have the same set of knights of different strengths: 3 1s, 2 2s, 1 3, and 1 4. Most start in supply; only a few are available to each player. The board shows a map of England, divided into several regions each of which has a different reward and a different minimum knight strength. At the bottom is France, with areas for battle cards. Each player has a board with several places for knights.

On your turn, place a knight in a legal location; English regions require a minimum knight strength, but these can be supplemented with squires and/or other knights. You can displace previously placed knights/squires by placing higher strength yourself. After all players' knights placed, resolve the English spaces in order -- the player there can earn gold, squires, knights, knight upgrades, etc., as well as the noble token (no duplicates per player). Then, the French battles; win or lose, the players earn some reward based on who contributed more. If lost, the cards move down one step to be resolved next turn (then, if lost, LOSE knights unless you pay gold to ransom knight back). Next, vote on 3 laws using voting tokens (earned from some English regions, board actions, and having previously collected nobles). These laws vary from awarding VP to players based on their tokens, or allow you to buy VP or other tokens, etc. After 5 rounds, the player with the most VP wins.

Lancaster seems to be one of those games in which we don't see anything new but the things we see are well implemented and the game is very well structured proving that there's no need for inventing the weel or discovering America to build something competent and good.
There are a few good ideas in this worker placement game: players have always a good thing to do and that usually means we're playing a good game. I like games in which almost every action a player makes is good because it means that players play positive and really want to play! A good example of this is Brass. Everything in Brass is good and the main obstacle players have is to decide better which action they should do because they are everything but bad! There are games in which we have loads of actions that only increase complexity but in a bad way because some of the actions players don't want to make really because they are almost inocuous. 
I have some issues about re-playability and am also not sure about nobels strenght. They seem too powerful although I understand that when you chose a Nobel you don't get a special favor but that only increases the importance of money in the game, one, and the military actions (battles), two, because every time a player plays against France he ends up chosing the free Nobel action. There seems to be a pattern in the game: playing first and get the free Nobel tile in the battle box. But I've only played twice só I admit I know nothing!

EDIT:
Don't play the game with 3 players. And be aware that the more players playing it the more downtime you have!

Quite quick game, so difficult choices between VPs or Engine. Enjoyed first game a lot, especially the engine v Vp choices. Worried about repeat play as the Parliament choice seem to funnel you, secondly you always get something in the game, via your castle and laws at end provide a dump for unwanted resources - it might be too soft a catch up/compensation mechanic.

Second game with 3 players - 4 preferable and I suspect 5 best. ;Funnelling' fears not dispelled, though playing it with gamers who prefer mid to light weight games showed it is for gamers as gap was quite wide.

Second play revealed lots of nice timing issues, but only if you get your nobles placed in the right order, especially the ability to upgrade a knight in a conflict. 

Amazing production, rules not perfectly written - especially about not having same type of noble in court.

5 players sweet spot. 
Squire mechanism not sure about; you can work out hoe many other players have then the overbidding is a bit obvious.

Interesting worker placement, with an Amun-Re like auction mechanism. It's fairly dry and abstract and probably prone to analysis paralysis with the wrong players, but it's also pretty clean and balanced. Played only once and would certainly like to play again.

A solid euro game that incorporates quite a few mechanics, work placement into the counties, voting on laws, engine building in the castle pieces and a bit of co-operative play to beat up the French.  The mechanics all fit nicely into the theme of the game.  It plays quickly and gives a satisfying game of an ideal length.  Great game even though I am fairly hopeless at playing it well.

This game is entirely dependent on the group you are playing with. Table talk and negotiation are essential for the voting rounds. A second playthrough is also essential as the first play will mostly be figuring out how to score points.

The first game is brutal.  You have to maximize your scoring really early in the game.
You don't really build up anything as you spend most of your resources every turn.
I definitely have to try it again to form a final opinion, but I feel it's not that great a game.

RATING: 7.5
Extremely polished worker placement from Matthias Cramer (Glen More) and Queen Games.

The most novel feature of the game is its voting system: in the second phase of each turn three "laws" with various bonuses (points for leading in different areas, etc.) are applied to every player. Before they are applied, however, three new laws are voted on; if they accepted, they displace an existing law. Each player gets one vote by default, but vote-cubes are a resource type and you can accrue more. It's interesting, and though it does seem to potentially inhibit strategic thinking -- e.g. a bonus for taking a certain tactical path that turn encourages all players to do the same thing -- in practice it seems to make the choices harder, which is always welcome. I've read that some groups play with a negotiation/alliance element but that isn't necessary.

The core of the game, however, is worker placement, and the core of the worker placement is the "England" zone. Players take turns placing a knight (strength 1-4), reinforced by X number of squires. Another player can displace that knight with their own, provided their knight + X value is higher. The first player gets their knight back, but the squires are tragically killed and return to the reserve. I really, really like this twist, which decreases first player advantage, adds another valuable resource type, and adds a level of direct interaction quite rare in worker placement games.

Of course, you get the most value from placing knights in England if you have money, which lets you take multiple bonuses. And you mustn't neglect to recruit and upgrade knights, nor chase victory points.

In short, it's one of those delightful games where you want to do everything at once, and can't, with some vicious interaction thrown in, all on the uncertain (but controllable!) footing provided by the laws.

Fantastic components, too. Love it.

Edit: Seems best with four players, but at the same time the limited options contribute to an excessively tactical game -- with fewer players there is more scope for actually choosing a development strategy instead of just taking whatever is left over. It's starting to feel a bit "samey". The noble bonus has generally been decisive, but I plan to try a conflict strategy and see if it works. We'll see. I expect the game will be improved by the expansion(s).

My rating for a long time was 6 after having played a fairly uninspired 5-player game years ago.  After having played with 4, I can say it is a fairly competent worker placement game, though there are many, many better options.  It's higher on AP than some of these games (due to being able to go almost anywhere by kicking someone out and then having to figure out where they will be likely to go.)  It's a pretty swingy, kingmakey kind of game, but the decisions are consistently interesting.

In the days before Agricola, this would have been called a sophisticated bidding game, with an Evo-like core mechanism. Develop your castle, acquire knights, play host to nobles, influence the laws of the land, go kick the French for honour.

A fine game of developing your power, while taking advantage of VP earning opportunities. Many timing factors - both relative to yourself (you can't upgrade or take a new knight if none are available), and relative to other players.

An Epic game in a short space of time and that's why it's one of my favourites. Plays well with 3 and love the voting each round for the new laws to be passed. Also love the mechanic with bumping of other players knights with stronger knights and the brain burn in the final stages of trying to ensure you've recruited all the knights and making best use of them. Excellent variation of the worker placement game.

Decent worker placement / area control type game. It can be a bit luck based depending on the laws that come out and how much of a kingmaker someone plays. But it isn't a bad game. Will play from time to time if in the mood for a more "mean" worker placement.

My wife and I both loved our first game of this.  Worker placement is one of our favorite mechanics and this game does it incredibly well.  I love the strength of the knights and how you can kick people out of spaces.  It's really quite awesome.  I felt the laws were a bit tacked on, but it did give you something else to worry about which added tension.  

This is a solid game and one I will eagerly play again if asked.  I won't own it because I have 2-player games with dummy bits but I'll gladly play when the occassion arises.

Remek egyveleg ez a játék. A különböző mechanizmusok tökéletesen összeforrnak, ráadásul a kerettörténet (Anglia a kora-középkorban) tökéletesen illeszkedik a mechanikához (például a franciaországi küldetés, ahol a lovagokat halmozzuk és vereség esetén pénzért kell kiváltani őket a fogságból). A döntési mechanizmusok sokfélék és izgalmasak. A szavazás egészen zseniálisan van megoldva, alig várja az ember: a jelenlegi törvényeket kiszorítják a jövőbeli törvények. Mindenki több szavazókövet is bevethet, de ezeket meg is kell szerezni (nem elég, ha valami csak nekem jó, mert akkor a többiek leszavazzák; vajon ha megszavazom, melyik másik törvény szorul ki az aktuális törvények közül? jó ez nekem vagy sem?). A játék egyetlen negatívuma, hogy a megyék körönkénti elfoglalásánál nagyon belassul a játék, mert a 3. körtől már nagyon megy egymás kitúrása. A mechanika itt is jó, csak a folyamatos újratervezés bizony jócskán megkívánja a gondolkozást. Aki az elejét nagyon elszúrja (mondjuk ehhez tenni is kell!) az már csak az alsóházban küzdhet és annak nyilván idegőrlő a megyék elosztásánál a várakozás. Ja és persze a 60 perces játékidő egy orbitális hazugság. 4-5 fővel 120 perc a játékidő.

I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this, but perhaps I shouldn't have been. Matthias Cramer is building a decent little resume for himself and it makes me more keen to check out Helvetia too.

Essentially an auction game with an optional (and possibly slightly overpowered) set collection aspect that plays quickly but has a good number of decisions to be made.

Update: Played a second time (with a horrifically messy rules explanation) and it still does seem as though the set collection of nobles will decide the game; the person with the largest collection won, and the person with the fewest came last.

This forced strategy seems a little disappointing, though I suppose if everyone is made aware of it, it remains fair. Just not my cup of tea, I suppose.

With the Reward Tiles expansion and the New Laws expansion this is a 10 but i would still rate the base game a 9.  

The Power of the King expansion does make the game more complicated.  It is good but i now think i prefer just the base game with the other expansions.

I've played Lancaster three times now. It reminds me of a cross between a worker placement game and an area control game. The tension in the game builds from the ability of players to bump knights (ie, workers) out of their position -- only to be re-bumped if another player can put together a stronger attack. In that sense you are always jockeying for position on the board and hoping that your current force will be enough. The game lasts only five rounds, but the time to play each round increases as you acquire more knights, and, therefore, more options. Although later rounds can be lengthy as players re-position their pieces, I never felt as if there was a great deal of downtime because I found myself considering alternative moves in case I did get bumped. I do have a concern that the game might fall into a number of set strategies, but I still enjoy the game. The placement mechanics are entertaining, combining a sense of bluff and warfare that lead to lots of moments where you glare across the board at the gleeful face of your enemy who somehow managed to knock your troops out of a prized location.

The one area where I think the game is less than elegant is in the laws. While they can certainly have an effect in the game, they also add in an element of inter-player politics that doesn't seem necessary. The laws are not enough to lower my overall opinion of the game, but they do seem a bit much in a game that already has a lot going on.

Starting this at a conservative 8 rating, but I very much suspect this will go up with future plays. Lancaster is just outstanding. Players quite simply have a marvelous mix of both strategic and tactical options for gaining ground, to the point where how you go about scoring points can kinda reflect your gaming personality. There are many, many paths to victory. And tactical choices are interesting. Grab points? Take what's available? Build your army? Your infrastructure? Do you use those squires to secure your spot or hang onto them for an end-of-round bonus? There's an awful lot going on here, and pretty much all of it is good. The only rules that can be a little tough to digest is losing your squires when someone bumps you from an area, and that could get very frustrating (and could easily put someone out of the running) if it happens to one person repeatedly. However, this is a minor quibble with a game that I am very fascinated by here in the early going!

In all fairness, I haven't played it when it really shines. Which is probably with four or more players. I only played a 2-player-session which means voting on the laws is not very suspenseful and quite conceivable. However this game involves lots of collecting tokens and pushing wood around the board without giving me even the slightest feeling of innovation. And everything just to be the most powerful ALLY of the king? Even though I don't find anything that speaks against this nice design, I'd look what else might rather hit the table when this comes to discussion.

First Impression:
An excellent and unique euro with a strong medieval politics theme.

This game is very elegant. Simple choices drive it, yet their repercussions are multiple. The castle element provides a good sense of accomplishment and growth, the semi-cooperative battles are perfectly implemented and the voting on laws is brilliant. The tactical placement of knights drives the whole ordeal, and it works both quickly and brutally. Luck plays a minimal role, but on the contrary reading your opponents and taking advantage of their actions is of utter importance. The theme is also great, authentic and really carries through.

On the downside, I can understand that the theme may be completely uninteresting to most players (unless they're English I suppose), even though it is perfectly intergrated.

I loved this game, I found it very refreshing and I can't wait to play more!

This is a very meaty and well designed game. We play with open information (everyone knows how much money, squires, etc each player has), plus a variant for how to set up the starting extension tiles in the castles. This is a strategic game, no idea why one may want to play with hidden information. The most interesting aspect of this game is that it is a worker placement game where the workers have values and can be assisted by squires to help them kick out other workers! This adds some very interesting twists in the game. All aspects of the game are well designed and provide many options. this is not a game for players with problems of analysis-paralysis (maybe that is why the designer added that squires and money is hidden information). The only mechanism that it is counter-intuitive the first time you play the game,  are the conflicts that become very powerful with new players that do not understand their value to the player that goes first and how to play to counter this advantage. This is a very tricky game. Get your copy now!

In 1413, the new king of England, Henry V of Lancaster, has ambitious plans: The unification of England and the conquest of the French crown! Each player takes the role of an ambitious aristocratic family. Who will be the best supporter of this young king, and the most powerful Lord of his time?

In Lancaster the players want to proceed from simply being a Lord to the most powerful ally of the king. They may achieve this by developing their own knighthood as well as by clever deployment of individual knights in the counties of England, at their own castle, and to conflicts with France. In parliament, they try to push laws from which they will benefit themselves most. The player with the most power points at the end of the game is the winner.

Together with Troyes, I think this one of the best game to come out in 2011. I just love the interactivity of this one, constantly having the gauge the strength of the other players' knights as well as the desirability of the upcoming laws. There is some engine building, but the game really is more about timing and reacting to other players' strategies and positions. On top of that, the components of this game are quite big/easy to handle, and they all look gorgeous, even though I would have like a lower price tag and a little less production (as some components are really unnecessary).

RATING: 7
Lancaster is an auction/worker placement game that works. The game is tense, angst-filled and features a novel mechanic. The novelty come from the introduction of laws  where scoring is determined through voting. The voting is quite intriguing as you are not only fighting for yourself, but also hoping someone else on the board will vote your direction. The addition of voting cubes makes voting less straightforward and unpredictable. This type of voting for scoring is quite an interesting twist to the standard scoring choices.

     The game escalates in a non-linear fashion over the 5 rounds. The first three rounds felt more preparatory in nature with the final two rounds having a clear shift toward VP accumulation. Each space on the board seems to be hotly contested and while the England-France conflict is not initially tantalizing, it became gridlocked in latter stages of the game. This game is all about player-player interaction.

   Still, the game is not without flaws. The bits are fiddly and there are lots of knights flying around the board. The flow of the game is not intuitive either with the phases not well interconnected. I misjudged the sequence of rewards a few times: enough to cost me at least a handful of point. Also AP is a definite issue, likely made worse through the use of screens to hide resources.

   Overall, Lancaster is an excellent design for the medium-heavy gamers in the Euro genre.

"Mediocre" pretty much describes this.  It tries to avoid the biggest problem of worker-placement games (don't get what you need and there's no plan B) by giving some private places to put your workers.  But those don't give the triangular-scoring tokens, which seem to dominate.  The competitive worker-placement part has a bad "dollar auction" feel, with disposable squires.  The rest of the game is soulless.

However, the game is a bit long and not something I think I'd need to play very often.

A worker placement game which sets itself apart with the special functions of the squires. Doesn't stick out as something special but doesn't really have any major blunders.

Huuuuge run away leader problem. Going for strong knights early will kneecap you really hard, if you get a large number instead you can upgrade them fast and easily. This should be explained to new players. Our winner had more votes, castle pieces, all of their knights, points, more EVERYTHING than all other players. One of the war tiles simply let's you take the hardest to get nobles for free! Why would I work so hard upgrading a knight anf paying 3 coins to get a valuable noble when I can get 7 points fighting a war AND get the noble that easy?

All of this is just game issues. The getting pushed off of worker spots is tedious and annoying and again, heavily helps quantity over quality. Bad game that has only one winning strategy, do wars and get automatic nobles.

Good looking game with good components and so on. Feels like a good game, but unfortunately my only game was incomplete, we stopped in the middle of the last round.

Update, 2 games: We managed to finish 2nd game in time and it felt good. We had only three players, so the province area was quite spacy. Most likely better with 4 or 5 players.

The game is good, but there isn't necessarily anything unique or brand new. Ok game to play, but no special need to play this again.

Updated after third play with four players. It felt nice, the board was nicely crowded. Like I said before, okay game, but may be nothing special.

Lancaster is a superbly-designed worker placement game that packs tons of fun into a relatively short play time (I was able to finish a game with 5 players within 1 hour and 15 minutes).  There's literally nothing I can complain about with this game:  The game has great production value, it paces itself well, and everything is just complex enough to not be overwhelming.  Furthermore, it is also surprisingly easy to teach to both new players and seasoned boardgamers alike.

THIS MOTHERF***ING GAME! 

On the surface, another soulless Euro, but OHHH MAN! The worker displacement mechanic combined with engine building (the castles/knight) and politics (law voting) creates a special blend of tension and excitement that is, in my experience, wholly unique. Wonderful production value is a bonus. Matthais Cramer has crafted a real underrated gem in Lancaster. 

ESSENTIAL! GET IT NOW YOU LAZY SLIME!

In 1413, the new king of England, Henry V of Lancaster, has ambitious plans: The unification of England and the conquest of the French crown! Each player takes the role of an ambitious aristocratic family. Who will be the best supporter of this young king, and the most powerful Lord of his time?
\13\\13\
In Lancaster the players want to proceed from simply being a Lord to the most powerful ally of the king. They may achieve this by developing their own knighthood as well as by clever deployment of individual knights in the counties of England, at their own castle, and to conflicts with France. In parliament, they try to push laws from which they will benefit themselves most. The player with the most power points at the end of the game is the winner.
\13\\13\
Every turn, players send their knights to the different locations:\13\
• Counties, where they compete with knights from other players for rewards and the favor of the nobles.\13\
• The castle, to receive income or new knights.\13\
• Into conflict with France, where all players combine their power and try to gain power points.\13\\13\

In the counties the strength of the knights is important as you can remove the knight of another player by placing a knight of your own with higher strength in the same location.

This is a solid mid-weight Euro, which I expected. What I didn't expect was how fast it is. Turns are brisk and even though there is a bunch of shuffling things around and rethinking your moves, the game never seems to slow down. Even the voting phase, which sounds like the very definition of a momentum breaker, never really comes close to putting a stick in the spokes.

The mechanics are pretty straightforward worker placement stuff, place all your guys and then get rewarded with better tools or new parts for your VP engine. The voting for laws aspect I mentioned earlier is probably the most interesting part, as nobles claimed in the worker placement phase give you the votes to pass (or block) new laws, which are usually short term tactical scoring opportunities.

If this was a two-hour game, I think it would be great on the first play and then slowly lose luster. The voting for laws is great, but the other VP tracks are pretty straight forward and powerful, so I think a certain amount of predictability is bound to creep in. Fortunately, it's not a two-hour game, but a 45-minute one! There isn't much out there that packs so much game into such a minuscule time frame. Besides, any worries I had about the long term play value were eventually answered by the expansions.

Eurogaming Lancaster rule pre-War of the Roses or what I call a Warro.  There's more politics than war in this game of control with a pasted on feel for the conflict in place at the time.  I put it in the solid 7 category and I'm glad to see a simple game set in this period.  Quality components you'd expect from a Queen game and makes for a nice change from claiming train routes or rolling dice for spaceships.

RATING: 8
I'm really glad I've found out about this game, it completely flew under my radar. It's a fresh take on worker placement genre with some clever twists in the mechanics. The whole game is a balancing act - you have to carefully develop and control various areas of the game. I really like the voting system and variable strength of workers - both of these mechanisms introduce a nice level of player interaction. Also, the gameplay is easy to teach and flows really smoothly. Check this game out if you can, it's a lot of fun.

The only problem is that Lancaster works best with high player count (you need at least 4 players, but preferably 5). Don't bother playing it with 2 or 3, there's not enough competition on the board.

Now having played this several times I can safely say it is my favorite Cramer game and one of my favorite games of all time.

There is a ton of tension in this one, pacing and conflict. The laws system is a fantastic mechanic. I normally don't like blind betting but this one, while important, isn't too brutal if you miss a vote.

I absolutely love the game and can't wait til the next time I have a chance to play it... 

UPDATE: It has only gotten better with age! Still lovin' it!

Noble families in England vying to maintain status of their castles during the period of King Henry V. Caylus style worker placement using money, knights, and squires to gain King's favor and win battles or use vote cubes to make law. Good depth but plays fast. War gamey with meeple placement and set collecting. Wow production quality.

Being a gentleman of the utmost quality, I couldn't bring myself to quit my first play of Lancaster in mid-game, as there isn't a single member of my gaming group (myself included) who brooks that brand of unsportsmanlike nonsense. But in retrospect there were a few ploys that I could have used to extricate myself.

[i]1. I could have reenacted the first 30 years of my life with sock puppets.[/i]

Everyone would have fallen asleep eventually, despite  the fact that somewhere around my teen years things would have gotten really weird. But in the midst of the indifference that ensued I could have slipped out through the garage.  

[i]2. I could have called upon the expertise of my local voodoo shaman and had a potion prepared to simulate my death.[/i]

This would have been three-step process. Step 1: Obtain the potion from a creepy shack on the Bayou. Step 2: Three turns into the game, scream "Look, a victory point!" to distract everyone's attention. Step 3: Quaff the elixir and fall into a blissful slumber.  Even if my opponents ended up cremating my comatose body, I would have appreciated my good fortune with a smile.

[i]3. I could have placed a worker in such a way that my intentions were neither clear nor precise.[/i]

The house fire that resulted from such rampant chaos would have allowed me a grand escape.

[i]4. I could have doped all the beer in the house with rufinol.[/i]

Ok, now I know why the host always keeps Ruffies in his dresser drawer.  Good thinking on his part.

[i]5. I could have made a loose play on words that would have tarnished the reputation of one of my tablemates' lovely spouses.[/i]

The offended player would have been forced to challenge me to a duel, and my subsequent real death would have ended my misery utterly and completely.

[i]Update:[/i]

I will continue to add more ploys, should they become available.

Fantastic game. Works well with 2, 3, 4 or 5 players. Easy to learn. Plenty of depth, variability and re-playability. 8 and 9 year olds have grasped it easily. Unusual in that beginner can play with an expert and you both can still have a fun game.
Well balanced game, with just the right amount of player interaction. Plays quickly. Highly recommend.

After a single play of this game I know that I already love it. It's also confirmed that I'm a big fan of this level of complexity and length in games. It doesn't overstay its welcome while giving your meaningful decisions each turn. It's also not overly rules-complex... so you're actually able to concentrate on strategies without getting caught up on how everything works. Very much looking forward to playing this game again soon.

Cool worker placement-game set in medieval England. It has an interesting twist to the worker placement, as stronger workers can kick weaker ones out of the spots they already took. Also, players can customize their game a little bit by upgrading different parts of their castle and influence the point scoring by voting for differen laws. Good game with a lot of variability.

While the game mechanics are sound, the various processes of a round feel disjointed, resulting in somewhat un-smooth play. Amount of AP can be high. Player interaction is high due to the bidding and potential for outbidding. Artwork is average and game component quality is above average.

This is a clever middleweight Euro game that looks like a worker placement game but plays like a clever auction game along the lines of Homesteaders or Cyclades... well... at least the auction part.  I'm not sure if it will feel like there are enough paths to victory (collecting nobles seems crazily important) in future games, but the board play seems interesting enough that it might not matter too much.

If you like worker placement games, you definitely will like Lancaster. This is a typical worker placement game. Why you should buy this one, you could say. There are already so many out there. Well this is one of the few games of this type, where you actual can win when using less knights (workers) then the other players. The laws that are in this game every round, make that you’ll focus on certain actions. If you aren’t interested at that moments law, you can focus on other areas of the game. By using squires you can expel other knights from certain areas. With the use of squires, there comes an gambling element into the game. How many squires will I use, because after using them, you will loose them. But if you won’t use them during the game, you will come short at the end of the game. A lot of small decisions you will have to make during the game, which make this one a great game in it’s genre.

I avoided Lancaster for a very long time. I looked at the map and thought it looked cartoony, boring and not rewarding but having now played it I really liked the game.   Its a very interesting game, you can plan ahead and seems to really shine with 5 players.    Would play again.

Bumpable worker placement game.

I'm a little surprised at how unenjoyable my first play was.  I felt like I had no control over my fate.  Like a ping pong ball in a tornado.  The bumping of other players' workers can be very costly and plays out like targeted attacks.  Which is a huge fail mechanic for me.

I decided to focus on nobles, and somehow finished with fewer nobles than two players for whom they were an afterthought.  Losing when another player plays better is one thing (I tied for 2nd/four, but half a board behind first place, who was also a noob).  Losing because your decisions don't matter just sucks.

I plan to try it once more to see if that feeling persists.  

Update: 2nd play went better, possibly because there were fewer players and less competition for placements.  If that's accurate then for me Lancaster is decent at 3p and bad at 4p.

Got this for the christmas. Hopefully it will take the base game to another level of comfusion and mayhem.. :evilgrin:

Edit: certainly complicated enough FOR ME (in a good way) to actually replace previously released versions. If the first version is enough for your brain to overburn, definitely stay away though..

A nice pattern recognition game. I'm not a big fan of speed games, but I don't hate them either. I prefer this to other Geistesblitz games because of the more complex cards (3 objects instead of 2).

My 6-year-old daughter loves this game and is almost as good as I am.

Geistesblitz 1 and 2 are fun light games that require just a little more thinking by the players than the typical filler does: 5 vor 12 brings the game to another level of madness though and, in order to make it pointlessly harder, forgets to include the fun, which was the core of both the previous games.

The ghost's moustache is totally sinister looking. Also, it is difficult to read analog clocks when they are not right side up.

I’m pretty good at normal Geistesblitz, which I find rather easy (compared to many other players at least), but this game dramatically increases the difficulty, which is awesome for especially me and my wife! Other players and beginners will likely get stomped, but I guess that can be said for any good game during people’s first play. And with subsequent plays everybody gets much better. 

Regular Geistesblitz only features two figures depicted on the cards, and you only need to be aware of whether the colors match or not (and then the optional, imho mandatory, book rule), but this version has three figures depicted which ramps up the difficulty, and then it adds a lot of optional extra rules which make the game so much more fun – now you have to shout out the name of some items instead of grabbing them, you have to grab the thing if it is mirrored in the mirror, you have to say what time the clock on the card shows etc., but only if certain conditions are met. Actually, if playing with all of the additional rules, I think there are just a handful of cards where you must do the “normal” thing from the base game!

Some of the cards seem contradicting, but there are rules regarding those few cards. Overall it’s a super version of an already excellent game, and those extra rules, which in my house are mandatory, really add an extra layer to the game!

Llega un punto en el que el juego original se queda corto, las rondas se deciden en quién ve primero la carta.
Con esta versión, 2 o 3 segundos para pensar qué objeto coger son inevitables... y luego están las variantes! Genial, creo que han conseguido perfeccionar un gran juego.

Like the two before it, an excellent fun game. But you'll either love it or hate it.

Oh, and it should be the first test to check if someone has the mental make-up to ever become a jet fighter pilot: play it and you'll understand. So pass this message on to the air force doctors that design the tests (and the people that fund them!): this one is the cheapest first selection round you'll ever be able to come up with.

This is the kind of game that you have a love/hate relationship with.  It's fun to play, but you get so frustrated (while still laughing the whole time) because the cards are hard to figure out right away and the blue color is always being mistaken for black unless they are on the same card.  Also, the advanced rules are EXTRA ridiculous.  lol

Has the same issue as Jungle Speed but the upside here is that there are more items to pick from. 
So the chances of getting hurt while you going in the grabbing frenzy is smaller.

My favorite dexterity game.  Very clever in that the game is designed as a race but the higher level pattern recognition skills you need to win the race often get short circuited by the more visceral reactions and emotions.  Game clearly requires skill and players can improve with incremental plays.  Can be very fun, and also very intense, though best with players of similar skill levels.

Other things I really enjoy about it:
1.  Very simple to teach (~1 min), difficult to master, especially in competitive settings
2.  Flexible in terms of required time for game play - can go anywhere from a few seconds for just a few cards to hours if people are really into it!
3.  Flexible in terms of number of people - you can play with 2 and likely beyond 8 if you can fit everyone in to grab.  You can also play in teams or have a free for all.
4.  Flexible range of ages - I've played with kids as young as 4 and all the way up to senior citizens.  The components are cute and the rules simple, allowing the game to masquerade as a children's game but the gameplay gives it much wider appeal. Great teaching tool for young kids - would also recommend it for educational purposes.
5.  Modular design allowing you to adjust difficulty level through introduce advanced rules and additional sets - I have played with all three sets together (Ghost Blitz, Ghost Blitz 2.0, and Ghost Blitz 5 to 12) and all the advanced rules, resulting in a game where you flip a card and stare at 19 objects to try to figure out what to grab or say before your opponent(s)!

Eine Karte wird vom Stapel aufgedeckt. Daruf sind 3 "Symbole" in 3 Farben abgebildet. Ziel ist jetzt als erster das Symbol, bzw. die Holzfigur zu schnappen, die in Farbe und Form richtig auf der Karte abgebildet ist. Falls es keine richtige Form auf der Karte abgebildet ist, muss die Figur geschnappt werden, dessen Farbe, noch Figur abgebildet ist. (scheiß Erklärung, sollte von den Regeln aber stimmen ;)).
Lustiges Reaktionsspiel, aber mir gefällt die "einfachere" Variante "Geistesblitz" besser, da gibt es weniger Figuren und verdreht den Kopf auch so genug...

Wasn't at all impressed on the first play, but it rapidly grew on us - using all of the rules (the basic game is pretty dull) and having one person act as a "dealer/referee" seems to work well, laying down each card and keeping track of who makes mistakes etc as things can get quite scrappy! 

The missus is hopeless at this game and therefore enjoys it immensely :)

This requires a funky pattern recognition, and is very challenging at first. But, then you add in the additional rules, which help further distinguish this game from the first two iterations in the series.

Add in that sometimes you have to shout what time is on a tiny clock on some of the cards, and you have some challenging times of poor reflexes and unhelpfully fast misfires.

Insanity? Yes. Quick moving? Yes. Pretty fun? It certainly can be. It does exactly what I want and is a quick little game that can play up to eight. Huzzah!

Um jogo com componentes e jogabilidade do outro mundo, numa ideia do génio Zeimet, que já nos tinha impressionado com a primeira versão e tantos outros jogos light, como Bamboleo, por exemplo... Mais complexo mas também muito mais prazerozo que o original, 23:55 é uma obra obrigatória em qualquer colecção e admira-me como não chegou a Spiel des Jahres!

Oh. My. God. My brain melted. And I love the original GB and have no such problems there. 

It is a few steps harder, not because of more rules and exceptions, but because the deduction process is completely different to normal Geistesblitz. In base game you have 5 objects in 5 colours and 2 object per card so you need to figure out the missing object-colour. Here there are 4 pairs of object with same colour plus the white ghost. Thing is not every card with 3 object requires the same deduction - it's different if the ghost is present or not and if ghost's colour is present on not. So instead of one line of deduction there are several. Of course on top of it there are several arbitrary exceptions "if this then pick that" to balance different skills out. But for anybody playing (and like me enjoying) GB basic + GB 2.0 together this is nothing new. 

Maybe I should have played it more, but now I'm kind of doubting this game is fun, as in: it's made to be challenging. Maybe just a step too far for me. As the base game is one of the most scary games out there anyway (to a high percentage of eurogamers and AP prone people). This is for those who played the hell out of the two previous sets.

After playing the resistance I was fairly hesitant to go back in time and play werewolf.

I had my concerns about a player sitting out to be the moderator but players really enjoyed both sides of the game.

Currently I prefer it to the resistance because of all the different roles means each game will be unique and special.

PERSONAL COPY. My first Ultimate Werewolf purchase. Two weeks in and I immediately jumped on the Ultimate Edition.

Really fun game for a large group of people, even if they've never played before or aren't even gamers.  However, If your group ranges between 5 and 10 people, you're better off playing The Resistance, for three reasons; one, no player elimination.  Two, plays much faster.  Three, doesn't need a moderator, all of which Werewolf can't boast.  You can bang out two or three games of The Resistance in the time it takes to play one game of Werewolf.

I'm not sure I would ever recommend this, since it doesn't come with the full complement of cards, and it's not like regular werewolf is not already compact. I purchased it to use as backups for cards that get worn out. But I would never use it as my primary source of werewolf cards.

If you've got the people to play it, then Werewolf is a fantastic game. It's not worth playing with anything less than 12 people.

Great party game, but its biggest flaw is player elimination. As the games can go for some time, I'm finding that to be a problem. But in a party gathering, the eliminated members are free to mingle, so I guess that's cool.

RATING: 8
Great deduction, social game.  The more the better.  Player elimination is a bit of a drag, so best played at a party where the "dead" villagers are able to go do something else, back to drinking or socializing etc.

Quality version of Werewolf.  Small, portable, good art and role descriptions on the cards.  Would much rather play other hidden role games but Werewolf is sometimes worth bringing out.

all of my game as a Moderator.

Never really played as a player, I think the game is boring for the Village or ppl who died earlier in the game. 

The voting for hanging is also feels clunky.

I had 20 people playing this, and was just awesome. Not so much a board or a card game but a party enhancer. Love it!

Brilliant, compact edition for guaranteed fun. Best party game on the market. Especially for it's €5,- price.
EDIT: The Resistance makes a strong case though, too.

[June 2017] Forget about The Resistance, being a fine game as it is, Werewolf reigns supreme with the party crowd. Have discovered a downside to this game as well: it being so small I've lost it during packing from a weekend with friends. No doubt (hopefully?) it will surface again, if not I do have the KS Ultimate edition so there is still a Werewolf in the house (hmm that is normally not something to be cheered for), so that is ok. 

But I like this game for its portability, its great (virtually non-existent) learning curve and the fact that even (or especially) non-gamers like it. There is a game for everyone, this is certainly occupying a big space in that presumption.

My kids love it too, even though with 5p and dad & mom always eaten/hung the first night/day it is tough to find the werewolves but that is fine. Games with kids are played to let them have fun (so you have fun). Vacation staple-goer! :)

Owning the "character meeples" ed. that only has 7 human meeples, the seer & 2 werewolves

Those we acquired from the 2014 KS project Character meeples

I do not own the compact ed. of UW...

Werewolf is an excellent party game, and Ultimate Werewolf: Compact Edition is a wonderful version, may I even say the [i]ultimate[/i] edition! I highly recommend it.

Rated this low for quality. If you are going to get Werewolf, which is a great game...just get the Ultimate edition. This is barely cheaper than the Ultimate edition and it comes in a flimsy worthless cardboard sleeve.

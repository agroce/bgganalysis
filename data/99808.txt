Meh.  Well-produced, but in a box that was much too big for this light game.  Fairly-punishing if you make a bad move, but at least it's over in 15-20 minutes.  Not sure I'd be interested in playing it again.

I need to play this a few more times. The design is brilliant, but I can't quite see the strategy. I should watch the designer's videos. This is either going to be a n 8 or a 6 when I get a few more plays in, maybe a 5 or a 9.

This game is a really nice treat (plays in 10-15 minutes). Nice components.  Easy to teach and play.  For gamers, it makes for a good filler.  It is likely to be fun for families as well.  Great box...complete with geometry joke.  

Curiously, if I play this game hungry, I start craving pizza.  Obviously, theme matters to me...and my stomach! Pizza!!!

Really interesting area majority game in which the size and shape of the areas changes from turn to turn, and the players only have partial control over those changes.  There's some bluffing and mind-reading involved.  Plus, with the anchovy expansion, the game can win, which makes the decisions even more interesting.

Using area control and simultaneous selection, you're putting toppings on a pizza and slicing it in an effort to be first to get all toppings of your colour on the board.  Somewhat chaotic, but there's no luck, and it's all about careful positioning and outguessing your opponents.  Works perfect for 3 players, great components and a really interesting theme and unusual gameplay.  Love the pizza box it comes in!
Don't forget the safety rule, best rephrased as follows: "If all of your toppings are in separate slices then you are safe that round."

I was a little disappointed with Pizza Theory. It's a quick 3-player game, but even at 15 minutes, the winner appears to be decided a few turns before it ends, making it drag a bit. It doesn't feel like the players have that much control as it's impossible to guess what your opponents are going to do and how it will affect how the pizza is divided. This game is very well produced though!

Kicsit fura játék. Nagyon gyors, nagyon könnyed, ezért szinte bármikor elővehető, de én részemről egyáltalán nem látom át a történéseket, ezért szinte random cselekszem, és nem is látok rá sok esélyt jelenelg, hogy jobban megértsem, de ez valszeg inkább csak az én bajom. Ami viszont a játék baja az az, hogy három személyes. Az ilyen gyors filler funkcióra így kicsit korlátozottan használható. De mondjuk arra jó, ha négyen játsztotok, de valakinek akad valami 15 perces dolga, addig lehet tolni egyet.

I'm normally against simultaneous action selection from the get go, and this one is pretty silly and random and pointless. And a player can be effectively eliminated from the game! Swell.

RATING: 6
One play. It's  short and fun enough. I like the simultaneous revealing of the slicing. Hard to tell whether a runaway leader can get pulled back or not as I ran away with it in our game and just went on to easy victory.

I wouldn't be surprised if this became a 7 though.

Gorgeous board and props.

Fun but not a deep game at all.  Little re  playability and a luck heavy game, unless you are psychic.  The pizza cutter placement can cause huge swings in the outcome and bad luck there will kill you.

Kind of fun little 3 player abstract with area majorities. "Slicing" the board into different shapes is the most interesting mechanic, and I've never seen anything quite like it. It's short and moves quickly. I'd play again.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (January 2017)

For some reason, I thought Pizza Theory was a flicking game, but I was surprised to find an abstract game. That happens to me because I buy lots of games without any research but that’s my MO and it is very unlikely to change. In general abstract games are not my cup of tea.

The rules are very easy to teach, you can do it under 4 minutes. The game´s components and art are good. I particularly like the pizza box, neat feature! Playtime is around 25 minutes.

The theme is novel.

Pizza Theory is a majority game coupled with simultaneous selection. There is no luck in it.

The decisions needed to play the game seems obvious at first, but they are more deep than I initially thought. In each turn you need to decide where will you cut the pizza, but having to guess and outguess your opponents is kind of fun. At first, I thought that when a player had too much stuff already on the pizza he was the foregone leader, but that wasn’t the case in our game and that is positive for me. On the bad side, a player can easily make a mistake and  benefit un-proportionally another player, but as the game play so quick I don’t mind much.

Bottom line, as I wrote before, abstracts are not my cup of tea, so I’m at best lukewarm toward the game. I think it can be a good introductory game, but it leaves me unsatisfied. It has a kingmaker effect. I already sold it. I would play again if requested.

Current Rating: 5.0

Excellent filler game for parties, zero language dependence makes it great for international game days. Downside is that it can only accommodate up to 3 players. But plays quickly enough to rotate players in and out. This game got lots of interested looks at a recent game day!

Played a prototype at KublaCon, May 2011.  I was immediately fascinated by the game play.  An intellectually challenging game that plays fast.

Unique three player game where you are trying to be the first player to run out of their toppings for a pizza.  The unique part is the splitting of the pizza pie using rods which create several different areas where whomever is in the majority replaces everyone else's tokens with his/her own.

Bought as a Kickstarter.

I haven't quite developed much of a strategy from two plays, aside from "Aim to slice so all your pieces are on one side of the cut"; I am not sure whether other strategies are revealed on repeated plays.  It's probably a "Play the people as much as the rules" game, which I always tend to ignore in favour of just playing the game to the best of my ability.

From the two games we played, it did seem to suffer from "person behind has no opportunity to catch up"; not sure if that improves with experience.  But then, with a game this short, it doesn't matter too much, because they can always win the next round instead.

I had high hopes for this one, and indeed the production quality is very nice indeed for a Kickstartered game. But the game resolves itself too quickly, the winner is obvious way before the end, and there's actually very little you can strategise when the other players' moves are far from obvious.

Can you play without getting hungry for pizza? The board is a great looking pizza with little spaces for ingredients like (pepper, mushroom, pepperoni, jalapeno, etc.) You place an ingredient and then decide where to cut the pizza by placing your stick. You want to get all of your toppings on the pizza before your opponent. A game with fun strategic options.

A simple simultaneous action game with no randomness about overthinking what your friends may or may not do.

Cute components can't save this game from its two main flaws:
-  The placement is extremely opaque:  Since you don't know where your opponents will be placing their cut and often can't really predict where the best placement is, so ends up being a SWAG (Simply a Wild A** Guess)
-  If you fall behind, you lose.  Once someone wins a large battle, they are going to have too much stuff on the board ever to lose--its a matter of log rolling.  Granted the game is short.

Highly recommended, and it really is nice to have something that will play three players (and do it well) in your game library.

rating increased... after repeated plays, I am still enjoying it, and it's more pleasant with the production art (my initial play was sitting in on a playtest with a publisher a couple of years back with a much more abstract prototype).  Rating increased again... my wife loves it, and several of the more casual gamers in my life.

:star: VERDICT
In reality, the game doesn't really work as there is too much possible choices for a simultaneous action selection game. It always ends in a unpredictable chaos that often is punishing for no good reasons. It's just not much fun with 2 players.  It gets better with 3 or the anchovies expansion, but the gameplay remains uninspired.

I love the production quality of the game — a consistent theme with [company=8405][/company].  At first, this can feel like an exercise of rock-paper-scissors, but once you catch on to how to slice correctly (and your opponents "cooperate" — i.e. you predict their optimal moves), you can come back from one solitary garlic to winning the game.

I have one big, two-pronged complaint, though, about this elegant and marvelously produced game:  The rulebook has a safety rule in order to prevent effective player elimination; however, it is perfectly ambiguous.  No problem!  We have a quotation on BGG from one of the designers, in which he gives a better explanation of the safety rule… which is still perfectly ambiguous, just in a different way.  What I've found to be the most playable safety rule is [article=10417594]Chris James' simple, unambiguous suggestion[/article]: If a player is in a position to lose all of his toppings [at once], they are all safe.

All in all, this is a deliciously unusual, quick, suspenseful game for precisely three players.

A revelation. Quick, fun, easy to learn, so difficult to master. But... after 15 games, the average time for a game is between 30 secondes and 5 minutes! Really crazy strategy, but nonetheless passionating. Critical strategy moves induce a high need for deep strategy to devise.

An abstract challenge for sure, but not interesting to me.  This game is dry.  And don't get attached to any pieces because they are not yours, unless they are on your back line.  Original ideas are incorporated into this game, but who cares?!

A decent abstract game.  Because of the rule that says you can't win via a mistake made by your opponent, we gotten into the habit of calling "Check" when we are one move away from winning.

Shared pieces traversal abstract with bouncing and shifting. Some good tactics to prevent your opponent from getting across are identifying a key [i]mid[/i]-move space along the way and landing or shifting a piece to that space to block other pieces moving through, and moving a piece as far forward as possible, thus reducing your opponent's choices for pieces to move. Another important factor is making sure the pieces near your home row cannot be bounced off into the goal space. To make sure of this, you need to empty your home row as soon as practically possible. Fascinating game that I'm eager to try again.

RATING: 6.75
Extremely clever game, though perhaps a bit [i]too[/i] clever.  I fear I wouldn't be able to coax my usual opponents past the initial stage of befuddlement.  

And even if I did, I'm also concerned that the game, played in earnest, could become an AP nightmare, as there are simply an insane number of things to be considered on each turn.  Perhaps this would act best as a correspondence game, though it's entirely possible that I'm overestimating it, since I'm not too far beyond that initial befuddlement myself.

Bij dit abstract spel moet je heel goed opletten, want voor je het beseft, doe je een foute zet en gaat je tegenspeler met de overwinning aan de haal. Dit spel heeft heel veel gelijkenissen met Kamisado (maar dan zonder kleuren). Kamisado vind ik wel leuker.

Seems to be a good game, but it has a problem that you can win or lose only because of 'blindness' of you or your opponent. Both of players should play very carefully. 

I need to play more, to make my own, honest opinion.

Gyges deserves more visibility...
It's a very deep abstract and I really like it. I've found an original edition and I've bought it at once... I don't like the Gigamic version. 
It must be played with the standard rules, that include the "replacement rule", to enjoy the game in its whole (and great) potential...

A decent abstract that just didn't get my skirt up that high, the best thing about it is how short it is while still thought provoking, although sometimes that is really too short, that and also the "bouncing" rule of your piece moving extra spaces equal to the piece it lands on. 

It is a little tricky as you have to try and plan a route that only benefits you and not the opponent, and that is really the entire game, and I guess I have been spoiled by so many other great abstracts available I feel are more interesting (I wonder if a couple more pieces and slightly bigger board would have done it for me)

Edit - 6 => 7 Played it a few more times, the time to play and simplicity are a little misleading to what the game offers, it is actually quite tricky indeed to pull off that planned route and just one misstep it seems will usually end it (interestingly with the tourney rules a mistake is not good enough for the opponent to win, he must create the win himself)

Brutally computational, seems like it would be decided when the second player places their pieces. It only takes a few moves to reveal the winner, but this is not interesting.

The game is better with the "advanced" rule of replacement, and you probably should never play without it. Apparently this is the standard rule anyway.

A really interesting abstract and fun to play.  The main objective is to create a situation where one can win with forked or multiple connections.  In other words, create a situation where on the next turn, you may win in more than one way/method.

Gyges appears from an initial scan to exist under the radar for many boardgamers but you feel from opening the box, seeing the pieces and reading the rules that Gyges has been influential in a very unassuming way.

A succesful abstract should be addictive, have a simplicity that belies the hard work and intelligence of the designer and push the boundaries of your thought processes (maybe even beyond).  Gyges has all these qualities.  Adding inspired twists to a familiar scenario - the shared pieces, the movement of pieces only from your back row and the range of movement based on the size of the piece and subsequently the size of piece it bounces off - Claude LeRoy has produced an intense abstract that will hurt your head (a lot) but certainly raise a smile of any abstract fan.

This game is a one-of-a-kind. It had been on my list of "to be tried out some day" titles, and when I finally got round to it I was stunned by how short and brutal it is, while maintaining a lot of variety, and even subtlety, once you have overcome the phase of dumb beginners' mistakes. I think Gyges should only be played with its complete original rules, i.e. with the option to hit and displace a piece. The dumbed-down basic game of the Gigamic edition is really a different, far less interesting  game, which beginners (and kids) would have to un-learn later if they start out with it - just not a good idea. Right now I am worried how the new Blue Orange version "Kang" might mess up a perfect game (start with the pieces off-board? Yikes!!).

A very tricky, subtly nuanced abstract. Since all of the pieces belong to both players, it's one of those "what helps you potentially also helps the other guy" games. Our first game was over in a flash, but game time remained short even after we gained a little experience. [3 plays; sold Apr'15]

In this stunning abstract two players strive to make a piece land on the opponent's first row... any piece, since all pieces are neutral. Players can only choose one of the pieces in the row closest to them, and move it orthogonally as many spaces as the number the piece indicates (1 to 3), over free squares excepting the last one; in that case the piece either bounces on the piece below (moving again, but the number of squares of the piece below) or takes its place (the piece below will have to be placed anywhere free but not beyond's the opponent's first row). 

Gygès has got everything to be wished for in abstract games: barely a handful of rules, originality, depth, a reasonable length (up to half an hour) and it can be played using different materials easily available (a draughts set, a piecepack, domino stones, Icehouse pyramids... even a 48-card deck is enough to make both board and pieces). If it becomes more readily available it should end up sitting right beside Lines of Action or Eleusis as a modern classic.

While I don't like games, like Quarto!, in which players don't have their own pieces, in this example there's a very brilliant and original variation. Players use common pieces but can only move those ones that lie on the closest line on their side. This makes the game very original. Also the mechanics (the bouncing and the substitution rules) are really original. At a first glance, anyway, it seems to me a too much tactic game, although a must for any abstract games lover, because of its uniqueness.

I like this game a lot, though it is very frustrating and difficult to visualize the complex networks that get created throughout the game. Though there are a very basic, minimal set of rules, this is definitely a game with a steep learning curve requiring at least a few games under your belt to not get knocked out before move 4! I'm wondering how playing with just the dumbed-down "basic rules" in the new Gigamic edition will effect the game's flow, length, and overall popularity.

Another quick-playing abstract game where you are trying to move pieces into a central area so that you can attempt to get to the other side in one move. The twist is that all pieces are the same color, so no one owns anything once it's in play -- you've armed your opponent at the same time you drew your gun. Nice going, Tex.

RATING: 7
Some mixed feeling: I try very hard to like this game that sounds as my perfect abstract: pieces in common to the two players, simple rules ... but then the real playing is weird: very short if you play without too much attention, or too long if you carefully try to outthink every move. In the end, something is missing, even if with more experience my general impression improves.

My newest crush, not sure if it's going to last.  It's like a chocolate-covered almond.  A tiny game (or at least that's how it feels at my level) -- games are over in 6 turns or so.  But those 6 turns are wild and sweet--you take your pieces on wild jumpy expeditions across the board, almost like the feeling of doing triple/quadruple jumps in checkers for almost every move.  Or a more sophisticated version of StreetSoccer, if you like.  Each move is a hard puzzle to solve--the number of possible moves is very great on most turns, so it is easy to surprise and easy to be ambushed.  There appears to be some strategy, though it is very compressed (the first 2 turns maybe), and after which the game is 95% tactical.  This last point is what may take the lustre off the game eventually--I don't care much for pure puzzle-solving games.  But in the meantime, I plan to have fun seeing how deeply I can dig into this one.  PS.  One more issue--I question if this has the immediate appeal that a game like YINSH has--it took me a couple plays to warm to it.  Not sure how easy it will be to get real-life opponents for this, should I purchase it (I've been playing with the AI on www.gyges.com so far).

The brutally fast nature of the game (at least for a beginners) made me enjoy the game, even though it is very puzzley and not especially heuristic.  The whole game can be over in a few turns, so it avoids the all-too-common problem with abstracts of the early plays feeling arbitrary yet very influential.

Abstract combinatorial game that you can play with a stash of Icehouse pyramids and 6x6 board!

Cool strange tactics, potentially long clever chains of jumps, shared pieces. The kind of game whose strategy and tactics are opaque to a newbie the first couple of plays! :)

Also the game's official website is quite nice with some tutorial info and AI player to practice against. :thumbsup:

Intense, challenging abstract strategy game.  Because "your" pieces are simply those that happen to be closest to you, you must play very carefully, lest your opponent force you to make precisely the moves she wanted to happen.  Additionally, nearly every path to your opponent's "base" provides a path back to yours, so by advancing, you very often make yourself vulnerable.

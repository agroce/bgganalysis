RATING: 6
Bit bland, and theme kinda pasted on, but it's a fun puzzle, trying to find how to separate each pile so that other players leave you the one you wanted

might need the included expansion for depth/complexity, and initatially feels a littlle overwhelming for newbies, but very pretty, some good card interactions. 

resources are scarce but a good mechanic to counter that.

also you get to support small developers.

One of the best "I split, you choose" games. Too much down time during the split. Tough choices and difficult to ascertain value of each pile makes the decisions fun and exciting. Specially like the pigeon and aircrafts.

Game plays quick and is highly replayable. Fewer components and easier/quicker than 7 Wonders, and with slightly more downtime.

Just a good, light game.

Underrated little gem with great art.  Simple to learn but very competitive. The splitting mechanic is really testing - I'm terrible at it! But every now and again I squeak out a win. (Rated after 5 plays at 2P).

Here's the problem: The target audience for this game will not suffer the Warden's AP, and the game is too thin (maybe 6 rounds) to make half of the game waiting for someone else to make a game-making-or-breaking decision.  It's absolutely gorgeous, but that's not enough.

I want to experiment and try this as a drafting game a la Sushi Go.

Print and play version. Nice short card game with great artwork and a neat splitting cards mechanism. Only downside is that, in a 3- or 4-player game, the player to the left of a dealer that is prone to making mistakes may get ahead from the others. Besides that, the game scales very well with any player count.

i love games where your actions don't just happen in a vacuum, but rather directly benefit the other player... maybe. in Skyward the dealer splits the drawn cards into piles for the players, but then the dealer receives only the pile that was left over. so, each turn you have the chance to put the cards you need into one pile, although you risk that juicy pile being taken first, leaving you with the nasty negative points pile. maybe it's better to just dilute your opponent's scoring cards across all the piles, but then do you get anything out of the swap? it's a crunchy decision each time!

The combination of mechanics is interesting, but the games I've played have been a bit meh. This might be a game that is better at two players.

My favourite Rule and Make game.  Spent a weekend demoing it to people and the game basically sold itself.  Fantastic art, compelling gameplay and a short play time are big pluses for this game.

The I-choose-you-split mechanic in the game is great at forcing interesting decisions.  I like it.

It's a nice simple tableau-building sort-of-drafting game - each turn one person (The Warden) has a hand of cards (4 times the number of players) and makes one stack per player. Then the other players choose one stack of cards in turn order, leaving The Warden to choose last. The actual card play is pretty straightforward (think Race for the Galaxy building but with simpler cards) but that mechanic is nice, and it plays swiftly.

The art is beautiful and I love card games but this one isn´t any fun for us. Won´t play this again.

I like the decision to utilise an ultra simplified combat system which makes the game fast flowing. Of course, as a combat mechanic it is not very realistic nor satisfying but fits a 6 player game perfectly. The only downside is that the game very quickly turns into a tug war with one player killing an army and the other player rebuilding it on the next turn. This continues until either one runs out of appropriate cards. 

There are a few situations when war tactics play a role, otherwise hand management is the meat of the game. You first have to build up your situation before moving into any greater offensive manoeuvres. But there again, waiting too long allows for your enemy to prepare himself as well. It was nice to see that all countries have a different deck which translates into different strategies as well.

I reckon Quartermaster General is best played as a 6 player game. This is a bit of shame because you do not have exactly six players too often. But when you do and have that 90min at your disposal, this is a nice alternative.

A very, very broad take on WW2, but a pretty good one.  The cards for each power seem to closely reflect what actually happened - really very strong flavour here.  if you are picky you'd say that Japan gets too much of it's own way early on and that Italy is OP for what it was - but these things balance the game out.
I think there is going to be a lot of replay value here and I can see thing working out differently everytime.  Choosing which cards to discard at the start of the game is very tough.

I would have played this game sooner but for the title. The game pretty much satisfies the desire for the rules to be on the cards. It can be as tense as it is fast and it is very easy for anyone to play. Very high repeat play value, and a far lower feeling of repetitiveness than one might expect. 216 cards & 20 turns or less gives an idea of just how many ways it can play out. Probably works well with any number of players up to 6, especially if one or two haven't played before. And the really interesting thing is that GMT have three similar games as yet unpublished which will be immediately compared to this.

9 up to 10 because of the six-player game.

If you want to play a world-wide WWII conquest game with more your non-wargaming friends and have more history (and skill) than Risk and want to play it in a couple of hours, which you can't do in Axis & Allies, then try this out.

If you a wargamer, and want to go to that happy place that wargames take you, look elsewhere.  The history is a bit wonky as Italy is usually way stronger than they historically were.  Japan is not a lot of fun to play.  The game has no dice and just lacks that "oomph" you like in a wargame.  And the game pieces leave something to be desired unless you are into tank meeples.

I'll play it over some dog turd like Agricola or Kingdom Builder, but I'm not going to choose it over a wargame.  It's not like I'm chaining Europe & Asia Engulfed or taking World in Flames over this, because they have different audiences and time scales.  I'm just saying I'll take a smaller segment of WWII and play that instead because this isn't going to satisfy my wargaming needs.

Bought mail order from Games Lore in August 2015. Very clever card driven supply based version of WW2. Perfect for teaching to players uninterested in war or wargames. Team game with up to six players, divided into axis and allies teams. Scales from 2-6 well, but must be difficult to control three factions in the 2-3 player games. I find controlling 2 to be hard.

Impressive how a so simple design can be so great and fun. Fast paced, very immersive and good looking at table. When i played this one for the first time with the Allies i think the game is very unballanced for them.

The expansions fix that.

This is a fabulous design; intense -- every decision is agonizing. Do you plan for a few turns down the road, to inflict maximum damage, or do you take advantage of the "sure thing" now? And a six player game is still a (relatively) short experience! So some outcomes are unrealistic -- big deal! This game is a better simulation of the fears and anxieties of the combatants than many a "conflict simulation" out there.

RATING: 8
World War II at a strategic level, boiled down to the barest bones.  Yet Quartermaster General retains a surprising, broad brush feel for that conflict.  This is achieved through the contrasting card decks of each power. A new player is well advised to look through their deck before play to appreciate the opportunities it may offer and the limitations it will impose.  There is sufficient choice in any hand of cards for it to never feel as though you are running along tram lines, while all the same there are realistic limitations (though, understandably, Italy feels over-powered).  This is not Risk. Player turns are quick - play a card, apply its effects, next player. The game rattles along and yet there is a surprisingly engaging narrative.  Good stuff.

Production quality is excellent.  The artwork is decent.  The rules are well written and clear.

Packs a lot of fun into a small playing time, with a real favour of the history and very varied nationalities. I am looking forward especially to playing the nationalities I haven’t attempted yet. Slight concern about player elimination, 5 players may sometimes be best for that reason  but I need more experience to form a firm view. On a first time play, an early player elimination could lead to a bad experience. But overall, really impressed.

RATING: 6
It's OK.  

The base game is very unbalanced in favour of the Allies.  The weakest deck, by far, is the Italians.  The Japanese deck is very defensive compared to the other decks and the lack of "status" cards isn't overcome by the one-time-use response cards (and the few status cards are worthless if they come out late).  It felt like the other decks were far more damaging to opponents.  So if the German deck doesn't come out nicely, then it's curtains for the Axis from very early on.  We knew that the Axis were done after about the 7th or 8th round.

I'd be interested in playing again with an expansion that balances the game better, but I wouldn't rush to play it again as is.

A fantastic paper-lite war game. I had heard that the cards successfully model history without additional rules, but I was still surprised by how true this was. This was an absolute blast and my team lost by a mile. I cannot wait to play this again and immediately went and bought the air marshal expansion. I hope they continue to expand this one while growing the Quartermaster series.

Played twice. First play was fun, second game was rather concerning.

This is NOT a strategic game.

It is far to deterministic based on the card draw. You can discard cards to draw into what you need but your deck is limited, you will run out, and running out early is terrible. 

Cards do not have a dual use like many other CDG's (Ops values etc) so you literally can't do whatever is not in your hand.

The Axis powers need to be aggressive, however if they don't get the card draw and early enough, it is over for them.

Also had a problem with Japan. Japan was making 8VP a turn and was ignored by the allies. However because of the unit limitation and the card limitation the Japanese could not really threaten America nor Moscow so they did nothing, very slowly.

The Japanese deck relies on various things happening to trigger their events however if they aren't fighting anyone, that just isn't happening. Whilst this is going on Germany and Italy fell to the 2 on 1 and the game ended.

The game is fun the first time, however 2 plays was too many.

Not great and uninspiring. Largely dependent on card draw insofar that a nation can go several turns without being able to do anything, even discarding 4 cards can hurt later on. Too repetitive, kill troop, troop replaces, kill troop, rinse and repeat. I would expect it to be more fun with a full quota of 6 players, but 3 players did not work.

This game is absolutely brilliant and great fun. Requires a couple of plays to know the different decks. Thrilling hand management and card driven strategy. Good replayability as players play different factions. It may feel a bit "scripted" sometimes but the two excellent expansion add a ton of new strategies to the mix. The only problem is to get 5-6p to play it, it doesn't work well with fewer players. To enjoy the game it should be really played with the tournament rules!

RATING: 9
I like this game! Its rules are relatively simple, and it feels like an extremely realistic WW2 simulation -- more so than any other war game I've played. Is it really a war game? Debatable, but it sure feels right. QG's design nudges players into historical lines of action, each game unfolds a bit differently, and players will get better with repeated plays. A game can be one-sided and end early, or it can be close and go the distance; this is fine with me. It can also be played solitaire if you want to kill an afternoon and improve your QG skills. 

On the down side, I can see that the game might drag with slow players, and there are certainly static periods where nothing seems to get accomplished. In one game, for example, Italy scored 6 points per round while the other five nations each scored 4 points -- 8 to 10 rounds in a row. To me, this perfectly captures instances of stalemated battlegrounds, but to others I can see how it could make for a boring game.

A really clever and innovative game. I don't think there has been a greater disparity between what I was expecting from the game (very little) and what it delivered (a lot). Genuinely no two games have played the same and I still feel I'm scratching the surface.

RATING: 7
This a great game at the price point.  I think that it is best with 2 or 6.

Weight: similar to Axis & allies, and plays in 90 minutes.

Mechanics: It is similar to Combat Commander in that you may not get the card that you want when you want it.  It is a lighter game, and some used to other games may be frustrated by the lack of control.  Having experience and an idea of what the decks are like is definitely an advantage.

Decent filler game. I have no strong feelings about it. Our only game of it was hamstrung by the Japanese and German players both getting terrible card-draws, causing the Japanese to not be able to do a single thing all game... but I think this sort of game is more about playing multiple rounds?

Maybe I'm just used to WW2 games feeling more epic, and that's what's left this weird taste in my mouth.

I don't hate it, on the contrary, I'd like to play a few more games of it... it just seems like an oddity to me at this point.


.... 

Second play of it yielded the same broken japanese and the same unfun feelings. This game is not good, it's broken. There are ways to fix it, but with so many other games out there that fill this specific niche, there's just no reason to.

The game I was waiting for. The whole of WWII playable in 2 hours. Played two 2-player-games so far. 1 Allied victory and 1 Axxis victory, both by a large margin. Although in the second game the Allies could have won by conquering two home spaces, if only the UK had one Land Battle card left. Hope I can organize a 6-player-game soon.

Taken as an experience game with the right group of people, Quartermaster General shines. The narrative of the game is especially charming and telling. This is usually not my type of game, but taken with a beer and pretzels attitude it has a place in my collection. 

Euro gamers and perfect information protagonists should beware as the randomness of the cards and gameplay may dictate outcomes. It also seems, that sometimes, your decision in playing cards is straightforward. This is not chess, but it's a fun session of Parcheesi with the right group.

RATING: 8
After one play. I was very surprised with all the tight decision-making this game offers to players. You want to do all the great things the cards offer you the chance to do, but you can only do one of them in a turn. And you can't neglect the basics like building Armies and Navies or simply fighting battles. 

It's all about playing how to play key cards in the most efficient manner possible before your opponents throw you off your stride. Will you help an ally? Do they have the saavy to take advantage of any help you give them? Will you lay the ground work for big returns in future turns? Or drive the enemy away from you now before some hurt is delivered to your doorstep?

It's also about point-scoring economics. Can you outpace the combined economies of your opponents before the game ends?

All the fun Axis & Allies ever delivered (and perhaps more, in the strategy and decision departments) minus the dice-rolling, money-changing, and force-building—unless that was where the fun was for you—and in just a sliver of the time.

My only concern is the ability of the United States to create supply and build units in Szechuan if the right card is made available early. That seems like an easy way for the US to just skip the Pacfic War altogether. Still, the United States must defend it once laid down. If the Japenese ever take it, chances are slim of a recovery.

On the plus side, if you ever wanted a card game that has the intensity of Friedrich or Maria without the rules overhead, check this one out!

Provisional rating, might change if I play more.

Feels a bit railroaded - each nation has their own strategy and deck, so you need to follow the optimal path for the nation you're playing. Which leads to a learning curve (or acceptance you'll screw up), all fine if everyone is the same experience level - if they're not it's going to be a bit one sided (my first game was very one sided, we got crushed and it wasn't fun in any sense of the word, just a mix of boredom and frustration and desire to get it over with and no desire to play it again).

Play seems only to make sense with a full compliment of 6 players, otherwise players have to play two or more nations, and Japan seems a bit odd - just ignore them and crush italy/germany. Certainly worked for our opponents.

Oh, and the move 2-4 VP every turn, people kept forgetting.

Overall, I can see why people love it (WWII in under an hour) but didn't work for me.

Pretty cool! The card engine is reminicient of Blue Moon (so, it's a game of using the cards in your deck as efficiently as possible), but the WWII flavor is nicely done. It's very impressionistic - Japan and Italy are not vastly different in strength from the US or UK, and you see all sorts of totally ahistorical stuff like Italy occupying India - but it still works and each nation's quite distinct deck plays evocatively. The team game aspect is fun also, you don't see a ton of them.

With 6 players (the ideal number) the pacing can be a touch slow - a couple super-thinky players will absolutely kill the game - but it's not too bad, and with normal people this will play in a very comfortable 70-85 minutes. The fonts are very poorly chosen (as usual) and way, way too small. But these are very minor complaints. Looking forward to getting some more plays in on this one.

RATING: 5
I enjoyed the first run-through, and I appreciated the fact that the game pretty much accomplished what it set out to do; namely to create a 90 minute World War II game that feels a bit like World War II. I would recommend it to people who like 1775: Rebellion, but I also disliked that game so what the hell do I know?

Well, there's this: unlike that game, where the team play aspect felt totally tacked on, there's a bit (but only a bit) of intrigue because making progress as a group is almost entirely dependent on the assistance of your allies but you don't really know what cards they're holding and if you play according to Hoyle they can't tell you.

But the real nugget of nice design in the game is this -- with a couple of rare exceptions, the cards in your hand, once played or otherwise discarded, are gone for good. This nicely models the degradation of resources and manpower in a way that is congruent with the overall mission statement of minimal rules overhead.

And yet? I'm skeptical of the game's staying power, in the final analysis; playing at a table with six people more or less ignorant of the contents of the deck was an entertaining fumble, and I suspect that a vast gulf in terms of deck knowledge will prove to be a strong advantage; but what happens when everyone knows what they have to play with? I suspect that victory will come to the side whose cards come out in just the right order, and what's the fun in that. Also, it definitely seemed like some positions are markedly more fun than others -- I played the U.S. which was a hoot, but the Soviets and Japanese, in particular, seem much more scripted.

 And, most of all, there's something of an uncanny valley problem, from my personal perspective as a guy who [i]really[/i] likes historically based wargaming. That is to say, I appreciate games with loads and loads of historical chrome -- my six-player go-to when time is not an obstacle is [i]Virgin Queen[/i] ferchrissake -- but a game with just a little bit of chrome can end up getting straitjacketed by it. So it goes with QG. My radical notion is that the game might could be improved with an initial card-drafting or even deck building portion before getting down to the business of map-based slaughter. That would necessitate ditching the trappings of World War II, but my point is that this, arguably, would be no great loss, not the way it would be a loss in a game that really drilled down to the nitty gritty. Put it on a fantasy map, make the players generic factions, drop the fixed teams -- this could be a hell of a game in the right hands. Maybe.

(I don't know -- did I just invent Mythotopia?)

Anyway, I didn't hate it, but it could have been more, is my point.

What Command and Colors did for tactical gaming, I think the Quartermaster General system may be able to do for the strategic level.

It's a super-streamlined Euro-wargame hybrid depicting the entire global conflict of WWII from the mid-1930's to 1945. It takes up to 6 (and is actually best and fastest with 6), and you can easily finish the entire war in 90-120 minutes. For such a simple rules system (about the same base rules complexity as say Memoir '44), it smoothly crams in an enormous amount of military history: land-naval interaction, supply lines, industrial production, manpower, economic warfare, technology, major combat tactics and doctrines such as Blitzkrieg, and perhaps trickiest, the strategic linkages among the different theaters (e.g. the major U.K. Commonwealth territories are quite important, the USSR can mess with Japan via Central Asia or Siberia, and there's an elegant representation of the U.S.' dilemma of the "two ocean war"). And it all plays really well as a competitive strategy game!

I blame Marco and Wifwendell for making me buy this fun game. 

Detailed comments to follow after a few more games, but ... 

First rules review and first full game (two-player) have been a blast so far! Other gamers came over to watch we were having such a good time playing. Wickedly fun game, some brilliant decision making required, all of the fortunes of war are here, absolutely a gem of a game. 

Really strongly recommended. This could go up to a 9 after a few more plays.

Quick and easy WWII game which plays in 2 hours. (Edit) After a few more plays reduced from 8.5 to 7.5.  Some of the countries (Japan, Italy, USSR) just aren't as dynamic as the others and that can make it a little stale for those players.

From early reading of rules and play. Will likely change over time. I like the team aspect, but some things like Italy's small deck and USA's deep deck seem to make for some uneven play and an odd player elimination mechanic.

After a few plays I stick with my 7. It's fun. A little light, but fun.

RATING: 9
Card-driven team-based Euro-wargame hybrid that provides an incredibly abstract overview of WWII where one team plays the Axis of Germany, Italy and Japan and the other plays the Allies of the UK, the USA and the Soviets. The abstraction is played out in a way that you can create situations for amusing alternative facts, like Japan successfully invading and occupying Australia or the Soviets occupying India. Sounds exactly like how I remember reading up on WWII history!

Remarkably simple to play, your turn goes very much like this - play a card that does something, check supply lines and make sure they can be traced back to supply areas, gain VP for having land forces occupy supply areas, discard cards at will and then draw back up to a hand of seven. Supposedly plays quicker at 6P than 2P, which is a remarkable achievement of itself but also makes sense since all countries need to be represented, and it's easier to manage one deck rather than three. That said, I've yet to play a 6P game to confirm this myself. Each of the 2P games I have played have been incredibly close in points, and that is a good thing because you can never be certain who will win until the last couple rounds.

This is not axis and allies. Each time I have played this it has been different. The card driven aspect and hand control are critical. If yo want an easy set of rules that are teachable in 15 min but still has some depth this is the game for you. This could easily be played with non-wargamers and I think they would enjoy it. The design is brilliant distilling the rule set down to only essential elements.

This is not a wargame but it works and it feels like it was.

The great ideia behind this game is that each main country involved in WW2 has its actions dictated by a specific deck that reproduces the real actions and power those countries had in the war. The game is then a card driven game where each player take his actions according to a hand management, while the dudes on the board are representations of strenght and not themselves combat units, as in a conventional wargame.
Very cool mechanics are involved here, as the one that reproduces the larger industrial power of a nation according to its deck size, being possible to "burn" (discard) the deck searching for those needed cards, or the one that permits to lay a card face down on the table, which is an automatic answer for a specific event the other side may trigger.
The game develops smooth and fast but its major drawbacks are the tendency to get a bit repetitive, the fact US and Japan almost always just fight alone with each other, and      the artificial (but usual) solution to get the game working with 3,4 or 5 players - to asigned a different number of countries to each player.

RATING: 8
(Played with air expansion) This is a card-driven area-control wargame that consists almost entirely of powerful take-that cards. Despite the very simple rules and short play time (for this kind of game), it features some interesting decision-making and room for setting up neat card combos.

It's completely wacky from an historical perspective, but the cards are so thematic as to make it a laff riot for serious (and not-so-serious) wargamers. Germany gets wiped off the map and Italy builds a huge empire until late in the game, when the Soviets and Brits whittle 'em down and the US plays a card that suddenly materializes the Free French as the new overlords of Western Europe and all of Africa. What's not to love? (Remember, this is a 90-120 minute game, not a 50 hour game.)

Note that, as with most card-driven games, the experience will be very different after a few tries, once players are familiar with the cards in the decks. I wasn't exaggerating about the game being one "gotcha" after another.

Really, this rates a '7' as a game, but it's just so flavorful, I've gotta give it a bonus point!

RATING: 9
Initial rating after two plays, no expansions. Everyone had a great time. Really happy to have found a team game that everyone likes - which has been a very tall order.

The basic system is so stripped down, you wouldn't think it was possible to convey so much theme, but the cards totally do. Most importantly, you get that very WWII feeling that everything is crucial, nothing is ever enough, you're never properly prepared, and all of your moves are either just in the nick of time or just moments too late.

So much fun, so exciting, can't wait to play again!

Cool variant to try:

Each power plays two cards each round, for a total of ten rounds. The two cards have to be of different types, there being eight card types.

The Calendar of Ten Rounds
1936-37: VP x 1/2
1938: VP x 1/2
1939: VP x 1 
1940: VP x 1
1941: VP x 1
1942: VP x 1
1943: VP x 2
1944: VP x 2
1945: VP x 3
1946: VP x 5

Our house rules benefited the Allies quite a bit, but it was still possible for Axis to win about 1/3 of the games.

RATING: 8
This is not a simulation of WWII - you probably need to tell hardcore wargamers this before you start. It's a knockabout strategy game heavily, and entertainingly themed on WWII.

I've tried it with 2 players and it runs a bit long for what it is that way - play with 4 or 6 and it snaps along.

RATING: 9
Most played game of 2015 for our group - always with six players. 

Brilliant design - fun, exciting, tense, always a different flow to the game. Simple mechanics but infinitely replayable due to card flow.

Axis probably only have a 30% chance of winning but that just makes it even more sweet when they do win!

Highly recommended.

This game came as a complete surprise to me! I love the fact that it's such a simple team game, even simpler than 1775: Rebellion and 1812: The Invasion of Canada. A couple of downsides are the constant victory point accumulation -- each of the two VP markers move 60 times per game! -- and the possibility of deck clumping. Still, there's too much fun to be had in a six-player game to let that detract from the enjoyment.

RATING: 9
Players are major powers fighting World War 2.  The game takes 20 turns, where each turn each of the six powers plays a card, resolves it, checks supply and scores victory points.  The game is ridiculously simple, incredibly abstracted, and amazingly playable and fun.  Ping ping ping - play a card, next player please.  Possibly hostage to the luck of the cards, and lots of to and fro yo-yo-ing, but it is so slick and fast, it barely matters.  I love the fact the deck size is directly related to a power's economy, and you can target that as a viable strategy.  Really good stuff.

I am no wargamer, in fact I actively dislike wargames.  But this is no wargame.  This is Twilight Struggle Redux (and for me that is a good thing as I don’t care hugely for the very long and complicated area control of Twilight Struggle).  

This is a card game with a board.  A game of almost unreal and unbelievable simplicity which, beyond all expectations, actually simulates the whole of World War 2 in 60 minutes.  
A game wherein the rules can be explained in three minutes but with a depth which belies this apparent simplicity.   

This is a game which demands six people yet has little downtime, a game for new gamers, for old gamers, for families, for almost anyone.   

A game which plays out so differently every single time due to the interactions of six separate decks of cards.  

A game which has endless replayability as each person plays a nation and each nation’s deck is totally different from any other.  

A game which is almost impossible to play a single time, all players will be demanding a second game immediately.  

A game which has been under the radar but which mechanically actually sets completely new ground:  six interacting decks and simple rules - there is a lot of scope in this for the future of a lot of other ideas and not just in this historical war context.  

This game is breaking new ground in a wholly addictive and entertaining manner.  

I like this game.

RATING: 6
Very simple WW2 strategic game that runs entirely off factional card decks / play one card a turn. The card economy, simple board play and flow of the game all work well. The major downside is you really need to know the card decks to play remotely effectively. I am told that experienced players will strip through their decks to find the key abilities for this faction and then the game turns hot, but if you don't know about this things are a bit more onestep forward one step back. Given the game is so simple and accessible mechanically I'm not sure this cuts it for me.

It isn't for everyone, and it isn't perfect. Even so, it's a 10/10. A low complexity, high strategy team game that never ever plays the same way twice. Smash hit at conventions, and is also excellent with 2 players.

It can be tough to get to the table at full player count as it's 6 player, and the theme turns some people off.

The idea of this is great – distill WWII down to the basics of build army/navy or attack with army/navy and then some bonus power cards. Each turn you play one card. Consequently, it plays 6P very well as turns are usually lightning quick, and the game is a pretty consistent 60-75 minutes.

Does it work? I get the sense after one play that it probably works some of the time and some of the time one side gets off to such a bad start that there’s nothing to be done. Each country has its own deck of cards with unique powers, and depending on how they come out will affect that country’s ability to be effective much more than any player decisions. I’d much rather be on the allies side of this one as they have the ability to beat the axis down unless the axis get off to such a fast start that they can’t be caught. 

Fun for an occasional play, but I wish there was one element added to the game such as each country getting to include some cards of their choice each game or at least put some in their starting hand to give the players some control over the shuffle.

This is a remarkable design.  A 6-player game that recreates WWII in an hour, and yet feels surprisingly faithful to its setting.  It is different from play to play, as the cards determine, and every country plays differently.

I know there are rules to play with fewer than 6, but for me it's exclusively a 6-player game.  If you don't have 6, I'd rather wait until we can play with 6.

I have now played all 6 countries.

The claim that it's a game about logistics is a bit overblown. The supply rules are similar to every other WWII strat game (you have to trace supply to your home country).

(1 play only): It is exactly what I've been looking for. A conquest game, with no dice, that plays in a little over an hour. A very smooth first game. Loved it.

After a few more plays: It's light weight and fun. Easy to teach, engaging to play and team games are a great mix up for the usual games nights. I tend to think the Air Marshall expansion is a must for this as it gives you more to do and allows for more headway to be made with more interesting combos and removes the grind of attrition type tit-for-tat play that can happen in the base game alone.

Only the one game (5-player), but this seems to be an amazing game design achievement.  How such a simplified gaming abstract can still drip with theme and the sense of real decisions, and produce a gaming story arc that we will still speaking about 30 minutes after the game finished, is amazing.  Do not be dismissive of the seemingly simple design, this is a brilliant war game, the best of the 'world on a map' type game I own (Rating 9.486, June 17).

Okay, so I've been really enjoying this game. I never solo board games anymore but I have been with this one. It plays well solo since there are so many countries and you play each according to its hand. You know what you have in mind for another country but the cards limit your response.

Also enjoyed face to face game.

The expansions definitely improve it. They allow you to cycle through your hand faster to give more choices.

The design suffers from overly limiting players' options with no great way to increase flexibility without potentially wrecking your late game. I like the idea of a fast paced 6 player simple WWII game and it works on that level. I think some small tweaks could really make it a great game. Something along the lines of when drawing cards you get to draw the type of card you want, either status or battle or build, which are separated out. That way you could at least have a good chance of getting that land battle card you really need for next turn, while still rewarding players that manage their hand.

Every single game I play ends the same way: I immediately want to play another one, either with the same nation or another one, and try a new strategy.

As with many card games, the first few games seem to be determined by the luck of the draw. However, as we progressively understand the strengths and weaknesses of each deck, we start to elaborate strategies and understand our opponents'.

Every game plays differently and I reckon one can play a few tens of those before finding it stale. My main concern is that some nations seem clearly more fun to play than others (Japan often was quite lonely in the Pacific during our games) and playing with less than 6 is less fluid, though I imagine 2 experience players could easily handle 3 decks.

Components: good quality on board, cards and tokens
Complex: easy to learn and control
Weight: light
Players: wroks well with 6
Length: less than 90 mins
Mechanics: area control, take that, partnerships
Decisions: not much but enough (which card to play, and when, where to go...)
Opinion: good game about WWII, first of all, the them is not among my favorites, but I have liked the game.
In play 6 powers of the WWII, and all of them are in play (with less than 6 players, some will control more than one), and you fight to score points controlling zones in the map, keeping your supply line.
What you do on your turn? You have a deck with X cards (different for each power), and you start with a hand of 7, from those, you play 1 each turn, can discard and draw again.
One thing you have to take care of your deck, if you run out of cards, your team will loose points for each card you have to draw and cannot.
As said, in your turn you play one card, check your supply lines and score points for your team. The card you play can be to build an army/navy with the appropriate supply, prepare a response for some circumstances, start a fight, prepare some bonuses for your power or one time event/warfare.
The scoring is depending on territories you control, and they must be supplied, so if you loose the supply line and cannot recover it... all your troops are out.
In a nutshell, a fast game to be played sometimes, offers enough fun and enough decisions. Easy to learn and start playing immediately, and it works with 6

A great light wargames that expands to 6 very effectively. This is the game I now bring to casual boardgame meet-ups and try to get the group to play. Similar complexity to many euros but I find much ore interesting depth and decision making.

Fills a great whole in the wargaming hobby.

(8/16/2016)After a 2 more plays I find it slightly biased towards the Allies. We probably were not playing very well as Axis but it seemed if luck and play were consistent Allies had a much easier game with a higher chance of victory. Still a fun game that we were able to play two games in 3.5 hours, 5 player game with 4 newbies.

6/12/2017 - Balance between Axis and Allies has gotten a lot better now that we know how to fight effectively for both. Can have a rough game for Germany or Japan if you don't draw some of the powerful cards quickly. Almost always play with the air expansion. Great game!

Wow, a fast and furious distillation of Axis & Allies that works really well. Very clean rules, but the variations on the cards make for some complex decisions. Took about an hour and a half for six players, which is pretty remarkable.

My biggest complaint would be about the graphic design. There are some areas on the map where the lines could have been drawn in a less ambiguous way, and coloring the sea lines white instead of black would also help a great deal. I'm sure after more familiarity with the map those problems disappear, but it's frustrating that they could have been avoided to begin with.

A really enjoyable super-light game about all of WWII that somehow manages to contain agonizing decisions and tradeoffs. The decks seem super swingy, though, and I have no idea of the game's balance--it seems tilted in favour of the Allies, but time will tell.
[EDIT] The game will likely involve some number of factions (around 2) getting steamrolled. Some people legitimately do not enjoy this. But I still love the game.

RATING: 8
Initially disappointed that I didn't get into a 5 player game of Scythe I agreed to join a 6 player game of this never-heard-of game. The board looked a bit generic WW2 war game, the box art was uninspiring and I feared that, with 6 players, there would be alot of down time similar to my experiences of Risk/Axis and Allies. 

But after playing this once I spent the entire rest of the night, and into the wee hours of the morning, thinking about that single play. I ended up picking up the game and expansions the next day. 

First Impressions:

Its a smooth war-game/euro hybrid that is very quick to play a turn (even at 6) but offers satisfying theme through the mechanics of each countries unique deck of cards. Players felt like they were playing a style that matched that countries historical role in the war. I believe the games replayability comes from mastering how to play the 6 countries deck and adapting to your allies and opponents.

Decisions are quick but rarely easy. The tension is rife; on the board - between players as countries vie for area control; in hand management - as players have to make difficult choices between what to keep and discard; and in the off-board arena of 'economic' conflict where even a players finite draw pile (representing their economic strength) can be burned to increase your productivity but may eventually lose your team points, becoming a liability as it diminishes by turn and opponent's economic warfare cards. 

I enjoyed the team play. As a first time player it was less stressful as we balanced teams having an even mix of experienced players with new players on each. The game allowed for some fun collaborative plays without lengthy amounts of negotiations. Even though, in the beginning, I kind of did my own thing, I eventually felt I was contributing to the team effort; and could see that my allies, in their own ways, adding to our score or area control . The eventual victory really felt like a team effort. Camaraderie is something that I find suprising but welcome after playing a Eurogame. 

I think the game would work well as a slightly more fiddly 2 player experience; with each player controlling all of its faction's decks. However it's probably quicker, and at it's best with a full compliment of 6 players, as each player only has 1 deck to manage.

We played with all the current expansions and the experience was richer for that. I'm not sure if it would have been to simplistic without them. Although the other players have played many games of vanilla and enjoyed them. There is a fair bit of randomness in the card draw but that can be mitigated by simple hand management and some of the new expansion rules and opening variants. For those who have a low direct conflict threshold, the team play does slightly mitigate this by spreading the pain and combat is fairly clean; being quick and mainly deterministic (no dice and few surprise combat card).

A highly under-rated game that deserves alot more exposure as an accessible war/euro game hybrid. An elegant 'Axis and Allies' for eurogamers and a new go-to wargame. 

Update: have played the vanilla base game with 6 players and had a very different experience. Overall felt more swingy and less tense. The expansions add more cards, new mechanics add much needed flexibility to balance the base game. I also missed the tension of needing to discard a card from hand at the end of your turn. Game ended very quickly with one team steamrolling the other. Thus reducing the rating to 8 without the expansions.

Wow that was boring, when was the fun supposed to set in..?

This feels pretty static, no dice roll, just the randomness of the card draw. The warying countries are supposed to follow their respective strategy.. wich feels pretty railroaded.

Play seems only to make sense with a full compliment of 6 players, otherwise players have to play two or more factions.. yeah like i always have 5 players at hand.. and if you do, you've got a roaring AP party at hand.

Moving the VP track after !EVERY! cardplay is a pain in the ass! Did i move the VP track or not..? Hm.. i think you.. hm.. not sure.. let's recount.. or better play a game that is fun.

Artwork & components are pretty good.

Great team based game.  This has the direct conflict of a game like Axis & Allies without the grinding drudgery.

I love this game because it can take 1-2 hr to finish a WW2 background boardgame(almost WW2 games need 4-6 hr), And this game easy to lean, some of luck in drawing card.   The "best part" of game is a scoring victory point system, each country must have to battle frequently, to stop enemy supply or protect my supply. That makes this game seem like "war".

Team-based (one team vs another team) To win, one team has to have a notable lead over the other. No dice. Each nation has their own deck of cards which gives you options on your turn and means to counter other players' actions. Took a few turns to wrap my head around [not a big fan of war games], but it was an interesting experience and did not take TOO long.

I would play it again maybe.

RATING: 7
Cotton candy-light area control game with a dash of WWII theme layered on top (mostly in the form of event cards and special abilities), QG does a good job of cramming a 6-player game with some interesting decision space into a 1-2 hour time frame - not an insignificant feat.  Luck of the draw seems to have a pretty strong effect, as there are some powerful events that can swing the game if played early (in our game, GB got the "Canada scores VP card" out in the 2nd turn, which adds up to an extra 36 points over the course of the game - enough to earn an autovictory on its own).  Subsequent plays might mitigate the luck element though.  Not really my idea of a main event game, but I'd be happy to play it on a weeknight if the rest of the table wasn't up for Imperial.

Three games in, and really enjoying it. I love how differently each country plays. And it seems like even with playing the same country twice in a row you could get a very different experience, based on the order in which your cards come up and what the other players are doing.

The only flaw I see so far, is that less economically robust countries (i.e. smaller deck size) are very vulnerable to bad card draws.

This is a pretty neat mix of card play and spatial relationships, so it's right up my alley.  I'm not sure how well it'd play without the exact player count of 6.  There's definitely a learning curve to certain decks, and the order of your draw can impact your scoring opportunities quite a bit.

RATING: 8
Simple, ingenious design. It's as much about hand management and deck knowledge as anything else - a number of the powers have to be very, very carful not to run out of cards before the game end as that can really hurt.

The interaction between the individual nation card decks, the map and the unit pools does a surprisingly decent job of reflecting WW2 at a super-macro level given the simplicity of the ruleset. The Axis can get off to a good start (with the Italians having the capacity to be the surprise stars) but in the long run the power of the USA will bring the Allies back into it if they haven't lost in the mid-game to an Axis  autowin.

To really appreciate the strategy the contents of all decks must be known in a decent amount of detail. I'm not there yet, so it's hard to fairly judge the game.

Excellent 6 Player team game - the cards limit your options, but the order they come out in always creates interesting situations and tensions between team members and the opposition.

In 6 games the Axis have won twice (30 point Blitzkreig & 250 points all tiebreak win), but the Axis are certainly more challenging to play.

A kind of a team war game for six or two players. Looks very nice, tempo is very fast and the game time is short. It is interesting how different team members can affect the balance on the other side of the map for the favor of their team members by seemingly very minor actions. In my first play the decisive moment of the game turned out to be Italy's two round long entry to the North Sea which was enough to temporarily lift the pressure from Japan as British offensive from Australia was effectively halted.

RATING: 8
The more I think about this game, the weirder it is. A light WWII game that suits six best? I mean, who's the constituency here? Anyway, it does play like Diplomacy for people who have mortgages, jobs, and lives. 

I liked it a lot (and my game was a frustrating stinker - we ended on an Axis victory, 250-250). There might be points where players have an incentive to just doink you every turn and you rebuild and they tag you again and you rebuild, repeat repeat repeat, but only more plays will tell. For the amount of time you spend on it? Great stuff.

I used to rate this an '8'. But I can rarely get 6 together, an the game is not real great without 6.

Tried it again with fewer than six. Meh.

So, why not Vassal, or Cyberboard? Apparently the designer is waiting YEARS now for Hexwar to produce something, I guess. So until that happens (if) the community has to suck it up, and the game collects dust on the shelf as we move onto something else.

As of AUG 2017 still waiting for cyberboard version.

As of NOV 2017, still waiting for cyberboard version - and of course Hexwar (hahahah!!!)

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This will only ever be a 6 player game for me, but it is an excellent three player game. Six different nations, each with a different deck and army composition makes for an interesting match in team play pitting three against three. Rules are fairly clear. Game play is simple. Be careful discarding cards to drill down and get desirable cards. Gotta do it sometimes, but one can get hurt if one does it too often.

60 minute 6 player wargame? Yes please, although it is not the sort of wargame you might be expecting. Probably one of the best team games I have played, with each army having a distinct feel to it, this is a great simulation of WWII with an emphasis on supply lines. Easy to teach, each turn is very quick so the downtime is minimal, each round (of 20) takes about 3 minutes if that. A game I look forward to playing again.

Simply put: I love this game, but this is definitely not everyone's taste.
A very fast game that needs 6 players to fully enjoy. Quite luck dependent though.
Edited on 25/10/2014: Played 2 more games and have a better understanding. The game in many ways is not a wargame, as your units can't move and the attack rule is very eurogamy. Also, your actions every turn are largely depend on your hand. QMG is more a hand management eurogame rathter than a typical wargame.
The strange part is that despite quite euro, the game's theme still feels natural and doesn't like paste-up. I'm not sure whether it's because of the highly thematic event/ status cards or the respective strength of different decks, we 6 players all agree that this is a great game and 1 even order a new copy for his group after the second game.
And remember to use the 'reallocate resources' variant. It makes the game much much better.
Rating up to 9.

For those who have only played once and thought this game too luck dependent: Give this game 1 more try! Once you get to know some of the key cards in your deck/ opponent's deck, the hand management becomes much more evident and important. You may still find it too luck dependent and lack of long term planning, though :(

Revisited this game 2 years later since it release. With the Victory or Death spin-off for comparison (we play QG then V/D same day), it is very obvious that V/D is the better one. QG was a tad too luck dependent and as 1 of my groupmates point out, sometimes it's just like 'game play you rather than you play game'. rating down to 8.
Now sure whether this would change with additions of the expansions.

I'm starting to think I'm a sucker for these team based light war games (1812, 1775). I love that this is a straight forward light romp that works with a large # of players.  My only complaint is it can feel like the cards are playing you rather than you playing them.  Each country has a focus (strengths), which I understand is for historical purposes.  I'd love a more generic setting/cards so you don't feel as pigeon-holed into a strategy.  Maybe that'll be less of an issue as I play more.

This is an ok light wargame. Not a lot to it, you need like 1 or 2 plays to feel out the decks but really its very simple. 

I get the feeling that there is no "being good" at this game. What I mean is that the options are so limited that there are only 1 maybe 2 real decisions to be made. Everyone knows the resource spots and they don't change. Even the extra points that pop up are static and obvious once people learn the decks. 

My fear is that with players of similar familiarity with the game, that top deck skills (read luck of the draw) will have more to do with the winner than any play on the board. You just don't have a lot of options for play, there are not enough scoring point on the board, there are not enough pieces available and card options to allow for experimentation. 

In the end QG is a little too lean, the game drives itself to an end, and the player is just there to push the obvious buttons. I suspect that the map will look about the same every time, and that timing of the cards will determine what side edges out the other.

10/20/14 Received. 
12/20/14 Played a three-player game. 
Quartermaster General is unlike my other games. I am a wargamer and a Eurogamer, and this game has aspects of both, which I applaud. I enjoy that it has low unit density, yet has loads of strategy options due to the variety of card combinations. Combat couldn't be simpler; no brain numbing odds calculations and die roll modifiers to figure, followed by dice rolling. A player's turn often only takes 30 to 60 seconds. Being able to play all of WW II in 20 turns (about two hours) is great. And about half the time the game ends earlier than that. The quality of the game board, cards, military units, and rule book are first class. The rules are clear. The historical significance of the text on the Response, Event, Status, and Economic Warfare cards is wonderful. It is true a player is at the mercy of the luck of the draw. But the ability to dump cards and redraw several can ameliorate this (as long as it not done too often - which will deplete your deck). I look forward to playing it with more players next time. I knew playing with only three would be mediocre at best (yet it beats not playing!). I hope for at least four in the future. I doubt I'll ever have six, but its something to aspire to.
10/03/15 Played a five-player game. Much superior to three-player. I still long to play with six.

Much better than I would have guessed. Scales nicely from 2-6 players, is teachable in a few minutes, and you can get 3 games in about 3 hours or so. Plays fast like Seven Wonders but still manages to capture an Alt History version of WWII in each game. Game is highly dependent of the draw of the cards, but skill in managing each country's unique deck of cards is rewarded. Although it's not the deepest game, it's a really enjoyable lite multiplayer wargame.

I was really excited about this game at first but after several games, I found that I didn't have any real desire to play again. It's quick, it accommodates 6 players, but I had some issues with it. The games were rarely close, usually one side established a lead early and kept it. It's not unusual to run out of cards before the game ends and it's not very fun. Playing the Japanese takes a certain kind of person to enjoy it. All in all, I decided that while I would play this occasionally, I didn't need to own a copy any longer.

Good game for those playing the US, Germany and the Soviets. Poor game experience for the UK, Italy and Japan who will spend the game frustrated. 

This game is very much skewed towards an allied victory and the chances of an Axis victory are slim at best.

An example of design to tell the story but forgetting the critical truth that unless weighted for both sides to have a fairly equal shot at victory, it loses the fun factor quickly and just becomes an over hyped yet clever game.

And the scoring mechanism is dreadful.

A bit too light, and a bit too lopsided - one team got super lucky out of the gate, while the other languished and could not make up the deficit created by the early struggle. This made the game unfun for half the table, gaining a mere 2 or even 1 vp per player per round while the other half simply stomped across the map, gaining 4 or 6 vp per player per round. I guess this could be a decent filler, but it doesn't seem like the kind of game that can be taken seriously.

Quartermaster General accomplishes what it set out to do: packing a decent WWII experience into a quick-playing, straightforward game. The main downside here is that you really need the right number of players, or else the game bogs down with someone playing two countries. But I don't let player limitations count against other games, so I won't here either. Overall and enjoyable experience I'd readily sign up for again.

The whole WW2, both fronts, 6 nations (Italy too, hoorrayyy!), with a humble set of cards and some wooden pieces. You score points... like an euro. Then plan your fights... with the tension of a wargame - a LIGHT wargame, but a wg nonetheless.

Sweet design. Simple, playable, yet tense. Great first wargame for non-wargamers (exp. for euro people), in my book.

At first, I wasn't interested because I thought this was a cube-pushing logistics game because of the title. I found QG to be a fast playing and very fun game covering both WWII theaters.  While this is an abstract game, the theme shines through very well. All of the games I played were completely different so there is a lot of replayability.

In this WW II game which supports 6 players, there are decks for each nation: Germany, Japan, Italy, Great Britian, United States and Russia. It's the Axis versus the Allies. One team can win right away if they have 30 VPs more than the other team, otherwise a game lasts 20 rounds, and you also win if you occupy the home nations of your opponents.

The decks are asymmetrical. Germany is the most powerful Axis deck, while the US is the most powerful deck, and the supporting nations can be considerably weaker.

It's fun to play the different decks to learn their abilities, and it is a tense game. The mechanics are simple and I'm looking forward to more games. There are some things I would like to try with different decks. What I like is that this game plays great with 6 players. Each game plays differently depending on what you draw and you have to adapt your strategy accordingly. Now the Allies do have an advantage, but I do like playing the underdogs to see if I can squeak out a win. 

Our group has played this a ton.  We know the Allies should win, and are trying different ways to fix it. The game was really good for us, but having played so much, the warts do show up. On the other hand, it is a great system, and I would rather much play Quarter Master General 1914. It was a great design, and my lowered rating doesn't represent the hours of fun we had with it. Currently, the fun has returned where we don't allow the Allies to mulligan, and we remove the Western US as a supply center, and put it in Hawaii instead. So we're definitely back to enjoying it again.

A World War 2 card-driven wargame... in 2 hours.

On the one hand, an incredible achievement in elegant design. On the other, an example of egregious balance issues unnecessarily favouring the historical winner: an issue inexplicably exacerbated by the expansions.

There is the germ of a sensational game here if the issues are ironed out.

Quite an achievement! Lure non-wargamers with streamlined rules and tight economy (1action per round and limited cards/units) to a good representation of WW II. 
Each faction feels and plays differently due to the uniqueness of the deck and starting cards/discards.
I've played this game 8 times and not all of them were memorable (some short plays were one-side), but they always told a story. And the 3 or 4 that were memorable, wow, we will remember them for a long time.

Best team game I've played, it is a niche hard to cover and this one fulfills it perfectly.

I am eager to conquer europe with germany and keep it, what is an achievement because late axis game is tough.

It's fun, don't get me wrong. However it is largely luck based. When you draw what card seems to determine most of what happens. Largely over-rated. It is quite good silly fun (in a tense - ooh does he have the right card kind of way... but whether he has the right card or not is down to sheer luck) and I do like the teams of three system, but ultimately it is far simpler and less elegant that it seems at first.

First impression (6 players): It might work with less players too but I'd probably try to play with 6 next time too. Was pretty ok. Probably games will be decided more by card draw than actual skill/maneuvers but was nice to play and worked relatively fast with 6 which always is a good thing and there aren't too many good(ish) 6 player games.

Very fun strategic game that is rather light-hearted almost compared to others in the genre.  I've only played as Japan, but I can see from the cards of the other players how each nation has its own unique play-style, which greatly increases replay-ability and strategical analysis.

This was okay but I don't like cooperatives even if disguised as a team game and the World War II theme doesn't tick a box for me. Plus lots of small writing on your cards (felt that they needed some iconography), lots of more small writing to read across the board on other players' status cards - to the point where I just didn't bother trying - and having to remember what your flipped down response cards do. Two green colours that were hard to differentiate. Lots of forgetting to score every turn too. However, game play was fluid which I found surprising in a six player game and had expected downtime.

Not your everyday wargame, this game had several features that made it enjoyable as a 6 player game. Essentially played as two teams, it is very fast paced for a war game, and has interesting dynamics.  What I liked most about it is that the gameplay was thematically on target, and that it was pretty simplistic, without die rolls or other time consuming resolutions to issues.  Would play again, but not something I would want to add to my game shelf.

First playing of this game, and I have to say it was WAY above my expectations. Having read the rules a couple of times I thought it would probably be a seven, but I'm going to start it off as a nine and see how it goes from there.

I love assymetric games because they provide very different gaming experiences depending on which side you play. But even aside from that, I can see lots of potential replayability depending how the cards come out.

The Axis powers went to such an early lead that I though that the allies could never catch up and possibly that the game was unbalanced. Wrong and Wrong. The allies caught up for a last gasp win on the final turn (20).

Can't wait to play this game again and can't recommend it highly enough to players of similar tastes to my own. Bear in mind this is a strategic game of supply, warfare is very simple and not the focus of the game. I love wargames too, but this isn't really a wargame, it's a lite game with a war theme. Though the first playing still took 3 hours, so it's only the gameplay that is lite.

thumbsup Superb quality board and components.

thumbsup Assymetric game play with plenty of replayability.

thumbsup Easy to learn and play. Quite a small manual.

thumbsup Very interesting strategic decisions without being a brain burner.

thumbsup 6 nations each with their own unique card deck, and separate quantity of armies, navies and cards.

RATING: 6
Quartermaster General is a team-based World War 2 game that's really more about logistics than it is about battle.  In fact, there's only two types of units (land and sea), and combat is entirely deterministic.  Where the game stands out is in its card play--each player receives a deck of cards that's specific to their nation, and each of the decks plays very differently.  Players work to set up card combos that are unique to their faction, and the game very much comes down to hand management.  This isn't really my style of game, but it's an interesting take on the World War 2 genre.

This is an asymmetric but seemingly quite well-balanced six-player two-team game. It can be played with fewer players but not at its best. It is card-driven, and you can only take one action per term, and only an action for which you have a card that gives you permission. As the title suggests, you must always have a supply line for your forces. It has been a big hit at STAG, and it plays quickly for a six-player game. It is a big advantage tho' to know what cards are in your country's deck.

The problem is that this is a six player WW2 game in 90 minutes and whilst I understand what it is trying to do, the compromises that it makes are not ones that work for me - it just doesn’t tell an interesting story, instead what evolves is often a ridiculous fantasy.
Because the play is so dependent on card combos, it is too common to be strong vs weak, or weak vs strong with an unsatisfactory result.
Ultimately, I don't think that it works often enough.

There are better 90 minute games and better WW2 strategic games. There might not be a better 90 minute WW2 game, so I'll just have to try something longer.

A bit of an odd game. Quite light and easy to learn. It's all about deck management. Probably best with 2 players, but if you like co-op games you might enjoy it with more (in team play). Not a lot of interesting decisions here, but an interesting application of simple euro-style mechanics to a traditional wargame topic.

RATING: 7.4
Surprisingly good.  Only 1 play so far.  Allies ran away with it and the Axis could never catch up. However, the development on the board was interesting, and it did feel plausibly like WWII - through a wide and somewhat blurry lens.  The strategy was pretty intense for a card-driven war game.  
Negatives: Cards had very small print which was tough on my old eyes. With 2 players on the first play, it took 4 hrs.  I think that play time will decrease significantly with experience, and with more players (which is the reverse of most games).

Update: I took this to my FLGS and they really liked it.  Extremely close and balanced game.  Axis was ahead all game, but Allies pulled out a 1 point victory on the last turn as the Axis ran out of cards.  Much better with more players.

Very good game at an even player count, with different strategies available. One weak player on a team and the team really suffers: it's got to be all in one direction to stand a chance of winning. So far, *every* game I've been in or seen has been an Allied win (about 8, total).

I found my game a bit boring. I was Britain and spent most of the game building ships in the North Sea and then losing them again. Meanwhile Russia did much the same with armies in Ukraine. I had a couple of cards early on that let me teleport to Australia and India and scored some points for that. And that was about it. I disliked the way you score an incremental (2-6, usually 4) points at the end of every single turn (and that we kept forgetting). That niggle was only reinforced by the game ending in a 250-250 tie. But I was assured that it was an atypical session, and I'd be prepared to give it another try. It is at least simple, snappy and unusual in playing with 6p and in teams.

RATING: 9
I've rated it as a four-, five- or six-player game.  Though if I was *only* thinking of playing it with six, I would have to rate the game as a perfect 10.  

If I was rating it as a two- or three-player game then I think I'd give it something more like an 8.  There's too much for the player to do, juggling three countries, and it slows down the game as a result.

More players is better - and unusually (uniquely?) faster as well.  Having each player play their own country allows them more time to think and to plan, and also ensures some very true-to-life tensions between allies.

It's a great game that manages to model WWII in a way that looks simple but has real depth.  As ever with my ratings, the fact that the game is absolutely full of lots of small, meaningful decisions and interaction means that it scores highly. It's really clever, the way that a card played at precisely the right time can be so powerful - but played the very next turn, not so.  Timing your actions is crucial to good play.

And having played it about ten times now, I can detect no real bias in favour of one side or the other, and no two games have played out in the same way.  But every game has told a story, and a story that read like that's what *might* have happened in WWII.  We've had walkover wins for each side.  And we've had really close games, that have come down to the final turn, or that have been decided by just a couple of points.

Rated after two 2-player games. Interesting and sometimes amusing, but often frustrating, because whether or not a country can do anything worthwhile on a turn seems a bit too dependent on the luck of the draw. Too many turns can go by where a country just won't get the cards they need.

Light, abstract WWII game that moves very quickly. Don't expect it to closely follow history--this is beer-and-pretzels at its best. Ostensibly, the focus is on supply (though controlling territory--specifically supply centers drive the victory points). The card decks (different for each power) dictate the action, and the card art is excellent. The learning curve is minimal, so this is a good one to introduce new players.

Enjoy this World War 2 in 2 hours Euro-Wargame even though there seems to be quite alot of randomness and luck involved from the card drafting mechanics. The way the cards come out will have a big impact in the game for the various factions and a bad starting hand can have a crippling effect on the player/faction. However the game remains fun, thematic and quick to play and has been a blast every time it came out so far even though the game seems sided against the Axis. 

The storyline as you play the game does not really stay memorable but its a great World War 2 Medium filler game with sufficient depth for which is one of its kind.

RATING: 8
I had long thought a 2 hour strategic game of WW2 was impossible. A holy grail. Turns out it's not only possible, but it's a tremendously fun and pacey game. And it's for 6 players. Remarkable.

The strategy decks, customized for each power and offering variability each play, are a work of genius. Discarding cards to score VP ensures that you have to craft a different strategy each game. The finite deck means QG doesn't suffer from the strong-get-stronger element a lot of these kinds of games are prone to. It also works as a way to simulate economic warfare with forced discards. It really is impressive how much is achieved with such a clean and compact system.

The team play works well. Allies rely on one another for aid, and aren't stuck playing their own game in their own corner. 

It's rare to come across a game this fresh on a subject that has been tackled so many times, but QC just works. I look forward to playing more games using this system.

Only played once, but what an interesting game.  Played 6 players, Ben-UK, John-USA, Lauraine-USSR, Gary-Italy, Stephen-Japan and me as the Germans.  Not sure about repeated plays, as I would imagine players get familiar with the deck and feel frustrated if certain cards don't turn up in a timely manner, could potentially be frustrating.
Having said that, in our game, Pearl Harbour happened just as the USA was landing in Europe and was a decisive blow against the Allies.  
Can't wait to try this again...

A team-based game covering WWII. Each player takes the role of one of the three Axis Powers or one of the three Allied powers.

Each power has a unique deck of cards from which the controlling player will draw. This deck tailors each country to follow a certain strategy or to fulfill a certain role.

For instance, Italy is primarily a support role, comparable to a "buffer" in MMOs. Japan is big on placing traps, i.e. response cards, making it akin some sort of crowd control class. 

Ultimately, this is a game of hand management and familiarity with the card decks. You need to base your strategies around what cards have been played and what cards have yet to be played.

Fairly simple and fun game which, surprisingly, manages to bear some resemblance to the narrative of WW2 as it unfolds, though sometimes with an unhistorical outcome.

The game is clean, quick, and historical.  However, it appears to suffer for a high amount of luck in what cards factions draw (or fail to draw), and even 1 of the 6 factions drawing particularly poorly can influence the whole game.  I am optimistic that a discard-3-for-any-basic-action rule (being tested by the designer) will address that issue and make the game awesome.

Like Memoir '44 or Pacifc Typhoon, Quartermaster General wears a WW2 wargame facade but it isn't one. It's really about using card-driven play to connect chains of pieces so you can dominate areas of the map.

Completely unexpected delight - WWII abstracted down to an hour and yet feeling wholly thematic and remarkably balanced.  My rating is probably helped by playing six player - I suspect that it may be a point lower with fewer players, but I'm itching to find out.
[Also genuinely amused that in the first game the Axis were smashed within six turns; we then swapped sides and, yes, this time the Allies got smashed although at least it took nine turns...  This suggests that the game is more balanced than it may appear.  Or, alternatively, that three of us were absolutely rubbish at the game. :))

To model WWII as well as it does, at this level of abstraction (the combatants begin with a single piece each!) and with such incredibly short and simple rules is quite extraordinary. By FAR the shortest WWII grand strategy game ever devised I think, and of course it delivers an entirely different experience to the far more complex games available on the subject, but still manages to convey an excellent narrative of the conflict.

Great wargame! As new players it is not so exiciting to play as Russia or Japan because the risk to be kicked out of the game is high (More with Russia than Japan).

Really great, we are at ~20 games of this and are not getting tired of it. Great tension between whether to play status and/or response cards versus cards that have an immediate effect. Decks are very thematic and fit the different countries, and make playing each of them different and interesting. Very quick to set up and play.

[5 plays] Back to back plays as the Allies as a 2 player match with Garrett. Later a big 6 player game on my birthday game day 2016.

Based on player number: 
Six player = 9
Five player to Three player = 7 or 8
Two player = 10

This is a clever system that gives the full atmosphere and tension of much more complicated WWII game in a package that can be taught and played in 2 hours. I love the artwork on the cards and the flavor text. The card play itself is full of tough choices. The combat is fast and elegantly handled. Ian Brody has designed one hell of a game here.

If I have only two concerns. The first is long term replayability (QMG might feel "samey" after a while without expansions - and expansions can be the death of elegant simplicity) .  The second is that in my (admittedly) very limited experience so far it seems like the Japanese can get too many response cards that are irrelevant if the Allied player drives the game towards a kill Germany first strategy.

These concerns could easily be proven negligible with time, and it would be a shame if someone hesitated experiencing this wonderful game because of those remarks. This is a winner.

EDIT 21.06.16
Played this the other day. It's one of the most innovative design in years. The expansion just adds to a great game. Also, I think you actually have to appreciate history a little to fully grasp how cool the design is.

EDIT 30.03.15 Several subsequent plays with 6 players. Still a fantastic game. Everyone has a blast, grognards, euroamers and ameritrashers alike.

Although, hard to win as axis, no?

Rated after 4 plays with 3, 2 and 6 players. It was great fun in all sessions. 2 players work better than 3 though, as one player will have 3 decks to master in a 3 player game. 6 players is a blast, with plenty of time to make plans with your partners in crime and trash talk your opponents during an already fast game. Only downside is, that the game plays so fast, that players constantly forget to add their points on the victory track at the end of their turn!

A real gem so far. Light rules, deep strategy. Actually simulates the war pretty accurately, with possibilities for alternate, historical routes. 

As mentioned elsewhere, probably balanced towards the allies. But hey, with 1,5-2 hours of playing time, you can just switch sides in the second game and see who fares better as the Axis powers.

I haven't owned it long, so my opinion may change, but so far I think this a great multiplayer euro war-game covering WW2.
Ok, after quite a few more games my opinion has solidified. This is a fantastic light wargame. Even with the expansion (that I now own) this game plays quick and smooth. Better players will tend to win but there is still a lot of luck in this puppy. Sometimes I think it gives you the illusion of more control than you actually have. If so, I don't mind. I'm always happy to sit down and play this.

RATING: 7
Played once.  Easy ruleset to get into, asymmetric abilities, dynamic-interactive play.  I played as Japan, which is an underpowered force that relies on forward planning and response, as opposed to big splashes of influence.   Japan's main rival in this game is the US, which possesses the ability to force massive discards from the Japan deck (Economic Warfare), which essentially ends your ability to take turns (which is kind of appropriate, but also kind of annoying).   Knowing that now, I would have played differently.  

Rating may go up as I see more plays.

RATING: 10
The simplicity of the basic mechanic — play one card per turn — belies an increasingly complex strategic game. 

Each nation’s deck has it’s strengths and weaknesses, so if you fail to plan ahead, or disregard how your cards can enhance one another (or enhance your allies), expect to be schooled by the more attentive and focused players at the table!

This is a remarkably elegant game: fast-paced, intense and fun, with excellent replay value.

Had a good time with this, but it came after some tedious online research to get many necessary card and rules clarifications, plus errata. Yet another game where that last stage of quality control, as unexciting as it may be for the creators to slog through, just didn't get the attention and care it should have.

Definitely recommended for the full complement of 6 players; for 2 or even 3, you're looking at dealing with so many cards that the cognitive load would probably get tough and kind of awkward.

Look out, there is so much score adjustment in this one that somewhere along the line, someone's bound to blow it, so be aware of that right off the bat!

RATING: 9
VA card game that recreates WW2 in an hour for 6 players. It's light, and the main decision (that seems to be missed by many) is when to drill down into the limited card resources to find a game saver or changer; often in response to a threat or opportunity opened up by a team mate. So,e games haVe been down to the wire nail biters , others have seen wild come backs and  a few damp squibs. It creates history with impressionist brush strokes and an on the fly narrative that seldom fails to engage.



So far my favourite game of 2014. It creates a fabulous narrative and without feeling scripted recreates and (more often£ invents new histories - India battled over by The Soviet Umion and Italy; the USA abandoning the Pacific....

I love that the status cards can give s strategic direction which can be knocked sideways by having to help out allies, or a desperate scrabble for the right card. Bring decked is a real risk for the weaker axis allies and can hurt Britain two.

Very clever and quick. Short rules, but there is depth here. Good narrative but possibly a few too many too and fro situations (?).

Make sure the decks are well shuffled!!!

Title not the best, but it will do.

SECOND PLAY: yes, very good indeed. Britain took a naval loss early on and struggled. Italy fell to resistane and Tito in the Balkans. Interestingly everything balanced out nicely. Really quite chaotic. Love it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I have no idea whether this is balanced at all; it didn't really feel it in our 2 plays, but it was oddly tense and impressively entertaining. I'm keen to try the Italians who might be pretty limited and the Japanese who are pretty sneaky with their response cards.

When I initially read the rules I was concerned about limited replayability. Those concerns still remain somewhat but I'm more concerned about the balance than anything. In our two plays, I've not seen a single Allied base fall, though I've seen Moscow be left empty and I've not seen the Axis be fewer than 50 points behind.

There's a lot to like here, but the perceived balance issues hold me back.

Update: I've not played 4 times and am *really* concerned about the balance. I'm pretty sure Germany needs to get Blitzkrieg out and the Axis really need a pretty much perfect game to win. Any other outcome and the Allies will run away with it. That's a real shame as I really enjoy the game otherwise.

Update: Okay, now at least I've seen 2 Axis wins (in 7 plays). I think the Allies are easier to learn perhaps more than anything else - and our gaming group has reported Axis wins elsewhere too. 

This might be the *perfect* 6 player game. A notoriously difficult number to find a game for.

Update: Okay, balance might be the wrong word, but there's definitely a lot of luck of the draw in this (even with the 4 card 'fix'). I've seen nations collapse from a bad run of cards too often, but for some reason I'm still willing to forgive QG.

Update: A player commented that at least one player almost always doesn't get to have fun; they are simply trying to hold on, usually just replacing killed units only to have them killed again. That might be an issue.

Rating up from 7 to 7.5 and then back down to 7 again.

This was a GenCon 2014 pickup.  I like playing it, it's simple, fun, and fast.  I realize that a lot of folks when looking at a game like this want lots of economics or lots of conflict.  Since this game focuses on the logistical aspects of WWII, gameplay feels right for the theme.

RATING: 4
I like the idea here (fairly simple team-based light war game), but there's a large element of luck and take-that cards.

These two elements work together to make the game less enjoyable. Each deck has certain really important cards that they want to get early in the game. If you don't get those cards you can be at a real disadvantage. It's also possible that someone can hit you with a card that makes you discard from your deck, and you'll just completely lose your important cards.

Wanted to like it, but it's just not very fun.

Excellent game - simplicity of rules, combined with lots of decision making, good interaction with others players and enjoyable gameplay. I love it. It is not 10 for three reasons:

 2) the similar art for each country
 3) the lack of Exp 1 in the main game - it seems not only to expand the game but changes the core mechanic. (Maybe this grunt is only mine as I have a homerule against buying expansions)

Pros:

- Great piece of elegant design, if nothing else. You still get the same kind of stories that you would from playing A&A but without that kind of time investment. It models historical aspects of the war extremely well, especially for this level of abstraction.

- Extremely approachable, easy to learn and teach

- It's strange, because I usually dislike luckless combat resolution, but the cards add a welcome element of uncertainty.

- Fast play time makes some of its deficiencies more easily ignored


Cons:

- Absolutely needs the full complement of 6

- Playing is Japan is an odd and not particularly fun experience. They are not proactive at all, unlike their historical counterpart, and rely almost entirely upon being attacked.

- Not sure how much variety there is to be had, once you get to know the decks. We'll have to see.

2 group outings and quite a few solo games, so some early impressions.

A social, fun, and somewhat relaxing experience, with room for trash talk. Impressive how this game manages to give a grand scale WWII experience in about 2 hours. I suspect that playing some powers, such as the Soviets, Japan and Italy (perhaps even Germany), might become a bit stale after a number of plays, due to lack of flexibility, but we'll see.

Bad draws can stifle a power considerably, and it's a pity that the optional rule of discarding 4 cards for 1 battle/build basically makes a Sealion impossible. For now, we're using a house rule of shuffling one of your initial 10 cards back in the draw deck for a battle/build instead.

RATING: 9
Quartermaster General has taken the card-driven wargame to an extreme that no other game has had the guts to do.  All thematic ties, and virtually all chrome is abstracted either onto the board or onto the cards.  The result is the simplest wargame ruleset I have ever seen, and I'm including feather-light titles like [gameid=181] and [gameid=10630] in that comparison.  Yet, there's plenty of tactical and strategic decisions for the player.  Hand management and timing play a big role, and the replayability is high due to the variable nature of card draws.  

Balance is a little iffy at the beginning.  Allies have an advantage among inexperienced players, even if you use the tournament rules.  It takes a thorough understanding of the deck and strong play for the Axis to overcome that advantage, combined with a bit of luck from card draws.  If any of the three Axis powers dither, the Allies will just crush them.  But, once players get better, the overwhelming advantage disappears.  At this point, I've now seen just as many Axis victories as Allies.  You just need to keep playing until the Axis players understand the decks and the strategic goals and can play accordingly.

As Japan, and a cold-hearted samurai at heart, I managed in the last but one turn to build my entire army and fleets, before the pesky Russians threw me out of China, because they could!
The game lasted the full twenty turns and was a victory to the Allies to the tune of around a dozen victory points. I learned a luittle more about the optimum of each nationality every time we play.

RATING: 4
QMG has all the fun of an Ameritrash game with the simple rules and short playing time (60-75 mins) of a Euro. At this point I wouldn't consider playing with less than 6, as having one player control several powers just kills the quick pace which is arguably the game's greatest virtue.

So why only a 6 rating? While the sense of narrative that develops is fun, I'm not entirely sure whether I'm playing the game or the game is playing me. Most of the time your decisions are reactive or otherwise obvious. If you look at the large-scale situation things are dynamic, but often an individual power doesn't do much for long stretches if not the whole game. It's fun to be on the winning team and feel like you're kicking ass, but being on the losing team and stuck in tit-for-tat hell not so much.

RATING: 6
A WWII game where keeping your armies and navies in supply has primacy.  What really makes the game stand out is being a six player game with six distinct factions that's playable in ~75 minutes.  The basic turn is play a card and draw a card, but the game has much more depth than that would suggest.  Each faction has their own unique deck.  Each deck varies in size which means some factions will need to be more judicious with how they use their cards.  As streamlined as the game is, there's still an advantage for players who are familiar with the makeup of their faction deck and what it will enable them to do.  The makeup of each factions' deck and unit mix is roughly in keeping with the faction's historic profile, but there remain many paths to choose.

It's not as though this game is unbalanced in favor of one side or the other, but so many of my plays have been blowouts. I have no idea why.  Need to keep playing the game to discover more of the nuances.  Plays best and quickest with six players.  Very fun original game.  Rating likely to go up or down depending on whether games become closer contests.  I'm predicting an upward trend.

I don't like military games. Antike is great because there is development and war is just part of the fun.
I am very happy to say I loved my first game at QG.
First of all, the rules are immensly simple and the details are limited and easy to learn. Gameplay also is very elegant, clean, simple and fast fast fast. I adore games with a high rythm.
QG must be played in has many players as it is possible, i would say. We were 6 and our game was great.
One of the few things i didn't like is the role of Italy: it seems the less fun of the country to be played and in 5 players i would give Germany and Italy to one player.
The best thing is probably the wonderful taste that this game gave me through all the play. Each player has his distinctive strategy and profile (wonderfully explained in the short intro in the rules) and it is amazingly rievocative of WWII but hopefully with surprises! We had Great Britain without a fleet (!), Italy at the doors of India (!!), Japan conquering Australia and so on. I was Russia and i had no "Build Army". I thought i was done from the beginning but just as the strategic hint told me, i had to defend Moscow ahd this is what i did until at the turn 13 or so i destroyed Rome and Berlin in one single turn. Fantastic. The Allied won with a very few points of margin after having been behind for the whole game, sometimes by 30 points or more. But even if i had lost i would have loved this elegant simple and captivating game.
So why just 7.8? i think it has scarse replayability and as i said, i hate war games. But rating could raise if i play it again (and i would like to)

[EDIT after 2nd play]
First time replayability was a concern but this second play at QG told me that probably no to games are the same. This time i still had Russia but my play was completely different. The game sensations were awesome, the game uncertain until the 19th turn when bombing berlin brought Germany to his knees.
Luck is a factor, yes, but soon or later each player will have a bad hand because decks are fixed but i dont see it as a potential problem.

Kudos to the authors for such a fine tuning and balancing. I like to think that this game was tested for YEARS before reaching such a level of balance with such different and evocative effects for each single player. 

Just WOW.

Area control war game like Risk, but without dice, and played with teams.  There is significant randomness due to the cards drawn.  We played two games, where the Axis won easily in the first game, and the Allies won easily in the second - the main difference was the draw of the cards.  The game can last up to 20 rounds (they go quickly), but both our games finished with the built-in "mercy" rule, where the game is over when one team is up by 30 points regardless of rounds played.  We all thought it's a fun game, and there was a lot of discussion afterwards about strategy and how the outcome might have changed if we had played it differently.

RATING: 5
Let's get the obvious out of the way: The title is absolutely terrible.  Is [i]Quartermaster General[/i] about distributing canned goods and extra socks to the boys on the front line?  What's the sequel - [i]Mess Hall Madman?[/i]

Anyway, everyone knows the old adage that when a game design is 'finished' another 50% should be ruthlessly sliced away.  Games should be as mechanically slim and tight as possible, since unnecessary complexity adds confusion and time without adding much fun.  In this case, the designer got drunk, started cutting, and didn't stop until a full 90% ended up on the butcherhouse floor.  He didn't just stop at fat, either.  He actually removed a good chunk of muscle and bone, which has resulted in the single most straightforward wargame of all time.

Each turn, a player plays a single card with a very simple effect (build a ship, land battle, etc.), and then that player scores.  That's it. Scoring is based on the number of supply areas occupied, though some Status cards will modify scoring.  It's a team game, so the Axis or Allied side wins or loses, not individual players.

It's all very opportunistic and tactical, and it reminds me of [i]Imperial[/i], but without the stocks.  It's a full-on Beer and Pretzels experience, and anyone expecting (or arguing) otherwise is certifiably insane.

Due to the painfully stripped down approach, my conclusion is that [i]Quartermaster[/i] is either drastically underdeveloped or drastically overdeveloped, which ends up being pretty much the same thing.  Too much seems to be missing, yet at the same time the stuff that remains still needs tweaking.  Replacing the single decks with early and late game decks could help, for example, since the order in which cards appear is critical for success.

Finally, I guarantee that every third player will forget to score (must score! every turn!), which will drive everyone crazy because the final tallies will be imprecise.

I can definitely see some euro/wargame crossover appeal, and I have nothing but best wishes for the designer, but in no way is this manna from heaven.  It's a K-ration, at best.

It's not a wargame, but it's more than a war-themed game. Each turn, each nation must play a card, and most of those cards have historical facts on them, but, as usual for card-driven wargames, that mixes all the events up in a most improbable way. But there is so much interaction and resource management, and so much direct conflict between players (and quite a bit of supportive team play) that it gets really intense and involved. It's an area-control resource management game with a heavily embedded WWII theme. But it feels and runs like a wargame...

Played 2 time. Had a great time playing this with six of us. It has simple rules and is fast playing.
Maybe to scripted if playing more?

When I was at GenCon 2016, I was lucky enough to meet the creator of this game. He's practically brilliant. Overall, this game is slightly stressful because it is a war game, but I think it's still a wonderful war game that I will continually play and love. You can even play it two player, if you're willing to bend the rules a little. Brilliant.

I think I found my 'plays under one hour' light game that I really enjoy. Normally I'm bored rapidly with such light games but Quartermaster is like 7 wonders is to civilization. Quick, yet depth. Elegant. Fun for a big group.

Fun and addictive. WW2 in about an hour (a little more if it goes the distance and/or it's your first game). It's all about the 6 different decks and how differently they play. 4 plays so far and it's turned out differently each time, with still more possibilities unexplored. 2-player so far; seems like in a 6 player game someone's going to get bored.

EDIT: Tried 3,4,5,6 player. Still fun, although I wouldn't use the team splits suggested in the manual. Putting Germany and Italy together while one person plays Japan can make for a very bored Japan in half the games. Either give the Japan player Italy as well or alternate control of Italy. Same with the Allies 2 player; make the UK one player, while another plays the US/USSR, or split the US.

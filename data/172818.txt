12-2-15: After one play, I really enjoy this game. The randomness of the storytelling aspect means it's good to not take it too seriously. Nice, fun, light game with some good decisions and beautiful artwork by Ryan Laukat, as always.

UPDATE 7-13-16: I've played it quite a bit since then. Bumped to a 10.

Story mechanic gives a lot of flavour, but rewards/penalties aren't really that connected to the text. Minimal player interaction, which can get a little boring. Gorgeous art.

I love Ryan Laukat's style of art, a real simplistic painted style. It helps create and pull you into a believable world in "Above and Below" that you want to explore. Great color theory was used here as well as in "Islebound", it's very beautiful to look at. I like the mystery of the outcomes in the choose your own adventure style of storytelling. The worker placement is very well done with the different types of actions that each worker can do. I love the way characters become exhausted and/or wounded and the way you bring them back to health and ready to work with again. I am loving Red Raven Games!

LIKE: Amazing, colorful artwork. The game mechanisms were interesting, and the variety of cards were interesting. Multiple strategies were apparent. Rounds went quick.
DISLIKE: Light. The storytelling could possibly get repetitive, but that would take quite a few plays.

OVERALL: There is enough interesting things going on in the game that keep your interest. The storytelling aspect is an interesting interruption, one that could get boring after several plays. Yet it is an interruption, one that slows down the pace. Overall, it's a laid-back game.

RATING: 7.5
I found this game absolutely charming. There were really three stand out qualities. First, the lovely illustrations. Ryan has a style I find fetching (and I know I am not alone). Second, of course the 'Below' vignettes - small story snippets that evoke adventure. They are simple and likely wear thin once you've read them all, but it is such a fun evocative way to obscure and gain resources. Third, the way you gain points by gathering different items. I like the decision of when to store them for points - it feels fresh. So overall, quite nice!

*Rating based on one play.

I had heard good things about this game going into my first play, so my expectations were high.  Unfortunately, I came away a bit disappointed.  The game was enjoyable and seems well designed, but didn't live up to expectations.

The central mechanism of the game is exploring below ground with its book of adventures, and I admit I was expecting more of this element going in.  The adventures are well-written little tales of whimsical adventures that seem to be very family-friendly, but I had been expecting a bit more differentiation in how the adventures are resolved.  As it is, nearly all of the adventures play out the same way: you get a choice of what to do, each with its own number of successes needed in order to achieve the desired result.  You then roll dice for your characters that you sent on the adventure to try to achieve the number of successes.  There are some means of mitigating the randomness of the dice, but really that's all there is to it.

My disappointment with this implementation is that all of the adventures feel samey.  You don't have specialized skills on your characters that push you to choose one path over another, and there really isn't any doubt as to which path is better.  The path with the higher success threshold is (as far as I encountered) always better than the path with the lower threshold.  There are no moral decisions to be made, no roleplaying elements to the decisions.  Your only real decision point is deciding how much you want to push your luck to try to achieve the better outcome.  You could just as easily skip reading the story text and simply list the difficulty numbers, and there would be little effect on the gameplay itself.

I like the conceit of the game, but I would like to see it taken a step further.  The designer has just scratched the surface of what is possible with this kind of game.  I hope that he will put more meat on the bones in a future design that uses this idea of a story-based adventure game.

On a completely separate note, I have to take issue with one small design decision in this game.  When a player goes exploring, the player whose turn is next is the one who reads the story snippet.  This seems a poor decision to me.  I think it should be the player whose turn it was previously should be the one to read the snippet so that the next player can continue thinking about what they will do on their turn as soon as the current player's turn is finished.  This would help the game move faster and reduce down time.

Played a few times.
To me the game itself was only decent but the stories are real fun.

You sort of just want to explore but that may not necessary be the best thing to do as far as building your engine.  

But the engine building isn't all that special in the whole scheme of things, so you'd rather just explore.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A really different way of approaching an engine-building game.  The art and theme work so well together that you can't help but be drawn in.  The strategies were non-obvious the first time through, but that's not a big problem.  My first "paragraph game," it added a choose-your-own-adventure mechanic that strangely kinda worked.

RATING: 9
Felt like my Terra Mystica ate Dungeons and Dragons and read the Hobbit before being turned into a piece of art by Ryan Laukat .  A more practical way to say that is "Above and Below" puts chance of dice rolls into an other wise strategy by the numbers worker assignment point accumulator with a style all its own.  Fairly quick to learn and with a ton of replay.  An expansion would be very welcome but not necessary.

Really beautiful game. Need to double check but we seemed to get the same paragraphs several times over 3 games. Not sure if they are doubled in the book, or we just had some crazy coincidental die rolls.

RATING: 6
An interesting game.  Fun and I see the larger goal of weaving story-telling with an underlying game system.  The problem is that the game system dominates.  So the better plan is to ignore the story-telling parts and build a strong engine.  And that's just stupid.  (Near and Far addresses this rather nicely!)

RATING: 7
1st play: Money is in short supply and there aren't a lot of depth to the choices. It's sort of a "roll dice, see what you get" game with great art. I wanted to try to collect sets, or go underground, or collect workers but there just aren't enough opportunities to build anything.

2nd play: This time, we played it as a story game first, and a eurogame second, and it's a LOT better this way. We invented storylines for resolving actions, and played just to experience the narrative. Played this way, this is a great game with lots of interesting adventures to be had. That said, with 200 stories, we really wouldn't take long until we had read or explored all of the actions of the caverns. Very group dependent, but with the right group it's a lot of fun.

Excelent game that, I believe, suffered a lot from the hype created around it. It's a really good game that everybody (reviewers) said it was the O of the BorogodÃ³ (sorry, brazilian joke :))and whem we played we almost felt chocked it was "only" really good.
Here, ate the house, we really enjoyed it and ha a great time reading the adventure texts, so much so that we almost forgot to play it "seriously" and my youngest ran us over to a crushing victory. I do believe that the texts will probably loose its charm overtime, but we will still have a solid family game. I heard Near and far has more solid story mechanisms, let's see.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
My family aren't really gamers. I thought the story element would draw them in but it didn't. (We only played once)
Here's what I think about the game. While it seems that many enjoy the adventuring part of the game, it doesn't seem essential to game play. Also the choices are a bit confusing as they're written. Most have 2 choices with 1 or 2 target values each you can shoot for. This is expressed verbally. Not the hardest thing to track but it would be easier if the target values weren't given or were read first. I also think the values take away from the game thematically.
There's no continuous narrative since you send groups of people exploring and they return at the end of the turn. They don't acquire experience, items or improve stats. (You do find items, but you don't equip your party) There's not a risk/reward system where say exploring deeper or longer results in better rewards. Instead you can send more people and/or hire better people to increase the odds of pulling off harder objectives (higher target number). Tales of the Arabian Nights doesn't have much of a game to it but it does have the narrative of a series of adventures that affect the character and collectively tells a story.

RATING: 9.5
Full disclosure: with Ryan and Malorie Laukat, I am one of the storybook writers for Above and Below's encounter book. Fun fun! (I am much enjoying my explorations in the clever and exciting encounters created by both Ryan and Malorie...)

Ryan continues to impress me to no end. Above and Below makes for a refreshing hybrid of quasi-worker placement and storytelling adventure, overflowing with characteristic Ryan Laukat charm. Thick tiles and colorful, quirky artwork (especially that Totoro-esque Cave Cat!) make you feel part of a fantastic over- and under- world. Rules are clean and intuitive, and components high quality and lavishly illustrated. 

My only gripe with the game is that in my plays so far it seems to end too quickly -- at least with two players. We have a suggested "Below and Above" game-lengthening variant here: https://boardgamegeek.com/article/20872823#20872823

For the Exploration outcomes, I think Ryan was wise to (in many cases) leave off explanations for the rewards given to the player. This gives the reader a chance to improvise clever or funny responses of her own as emergent storytelling. (Maybe an outstanding bit of role-playing warrants a coin or a bonus point?)

I look forward to many, many more games. Thank you, Ryan, for such a delight -- and for putting me in the game as one of the villagers!

The mechanical side of the game is ok, but I was disappointed in how dry it felt.
The story sections were varied in text, but the resolution of them is dissatisfying.

Basically, I'm sad to say that I was not particularly impressed.

Un gioco diverso che diverte al tavolo e che invoglia anche a fare una seconda partita. Ma che lascia una sensazione di lavoro incompiuto o potenzialitÃ  non sfrutta, si deve esplorare per vincere e una volta trovato la difficoltÃ  media delle quest ci si aggeggia e si affronta l'esplorazione senza rischi scegliendo sempre l'opzione piÃ¹ difficile da affrontare.

RATING: 3
I wasn't a fan of the mechanics or the theme of this game. I didn't like that my actions were limited by the people in my town, and that the success of these limited actions were determined by a roll of the dice. The stories were half-done and only explained in a sentence or two what you were encountering. Then, after the outcome of the dice, all you get is a resource. The story was not completed. I also have Tales of the Arabian Nights and was expecting something half as good and was disappointed. I couldn't help but compare the two. 

In Short:
*Above and Below (to me) is a crappy version of the Tales of the Arabian Nights.

Backed the Kickstarter.
The Game is super light, and easy to play.

Its a stunning looking game. I love the artwork. 
I also love that there is something to this game, other than just the choice of story. Building is always such a treat and the village looks good when all the cards are touching. I wish we could get more beds in the game and easier, but that's not a terrible thing.

Stories are a neat, and become super fun with friends.
My son and I played this game together first and in his story, he only had the option of punching a old women because of the lanterns required, its still remarked upon and laughed about.
I do however wish they had a sub story for the action chosen, although us learning to add our thoughts are fun, and we are getting better, SLOWLY.

For sure I will be getting life out of this game and I am glad its in my collection. WHAT A TREAT.

Above and Below is a mashup of town-building and storytelling where you and up to three friends compete to build the best village above and below ground. In the game, you send your villagers to perform jobs like exploring the cave, harvesting resources, and constructing houses. Each villager has unique skills and abilities, and you must decide how to best use them. You have your own personal village board, and you slide the villagers on this board to various areas to indicate that they've been given jobs to do. Will you send Hanna along on the expedition to the cave? Or should she instead spend her time teaching important skills to one of the young villagers?

RATING: 6
Tough to decide what I really think about it. It has two completely different games (one Euro, the other ameritrash) melded together with the thinnest of connections. 

It's both interestingly unique and also a little undercooked. I would definitely like it more if either "side" of the game were more developed and interesting. It's pleasant in its own way. But the end product is a very mild experience.

It has taken me ages to rate Above and Below. However, after over a year of owning it, I have to admit the game offers something very pleasant to the play experience. 

Both sides of the game (narrative v mechanical) could use more depth, but not every game need be as heavy as I'd like. For what it is, A&B is a delight.

Ryan Laukat is a wonderfully talented individual, but in my humble opinion his talents do not include game design. He is an incredible artist and a solid graphic designer, but his games leave me with a sour taste in my mouth at best. This in particular is such an interesting setup, and the resource collection that leads to scaling VP and money generation is great, but the implementation of the overall game is just so incredibly frustrating that it is mind boggling. 

Here is how it works:Go exploring (using at least two of your 3-4 workers to do so). Read a random passage that has NOTHING to do with anything whatsoever. Nothing to do with the people you sent on the mission, nothing to do with anything you have done so far in the game, nothing to do with the buildings you've built, nothing to do with ANYTHING, it is simply a passage chosen by a die roll. You are presented with choices that are essentially meaningless. The only choice you make is how much "explore" successes you can generate based on who you sent on the mission. Often these are trivially easy because of the range of options, in our game no one ever failed a single mission. Then when you succeed? No resolution text, no sense of any real progress or achievement at all, you simply get rewards determined by the book, in a manner that often makes no fucking sense whatsoever. You rolled three successes? -1 reputation and one pot for you! Why does this make thematic sense? *shrug*

Above & Below offers a variety of game mechanics while keeping complexity relatively low. The artwork is very pleasant, the gameplay is fast-paced even with 4 players, and the bits of stories are interesting (especially when read dramatically). 
My only small critique is that the choices the game presents can be forced at times. For example, when exploring a cave, you are given a few choices to react to the event that was read to you. However, most of the time I find myself choosing the option that seemed most plausible with my current resources, not choosing based on the story that was read.
Overall, it is a great game with lots of variety to keep things interesting.

Absolutely Charming. Above and Below has a little bit of everything. You build up your village, make tough decisions of how to allocate resources and villages and go on adventures. The adventures play out as a 'lite' version of Tales of Arabian Nights with more control over the outcome thanks to choosing which villagers go. Additionally, adventures feed back nicely into the village building, as even an event that didn't go your way will result in explored caves that you can build in. 

My only negative is that the games have consistently felt too short. A couple more rounds would allow your engine-building to pay off, (though how many rounds more would likely be different depending on how many players you have)

All in all, its a very satisfying game that scratches a number of itches, gorgeous art and is a pleasant stepping stone between gateway games and hardcore ones.

You are walking along a dark passage when you see a light through a door. You open the door and walk in. You enter a room filled with bedraggled, moaning characters. You ask what's wrong. One of them says, "As punishment, we've been sentenced to play this abominable game called Above and Below. It is the worst torture imaginable." 
Do you leave without helping to move on in your explorations (Gain the wrath of all civilized creatures) or
Help them destroy the game (Gain infinite reputation).

RATING: 7
The paragraph-based adventures of Tales of the Arabian Nights meet a simple engine building game.  Ryan Laukat has created a charming world for his games and peopled it with both humans and anthropomorphic creatures.  It's something of a shame then that the adventures in the base game tend to be perfunctory and unsophisticated - meet creature(s) and help/harm/run away.   Success is defined in terms of resources gained, rather than a resolution to the story.  This tends to put the focus on the less interesting business of getting stuff and converting it into victory points.  

Above and Below isn't a worker placement game in the usual sense in that we aren't competing for spots on  a board.  Rather, workers are allocated to tasks and there are some that only specialist workers can do. I have to confess that I found some satisfaction in sending my HR recruitment specialist off to the fields to pick me yet another pear.  I like the mechanism whereby spent workers need a bed to rest in or some cider to drink before they're ready for another day's work.  

Ultimately, Above and Beyond may disappoint both the cube pushers and those who want games that tell stories.  You might call it an interesting failure but that still places it ahead of the landfill dungeon crawlers and the spreadsheet euros.

Production quality is very good and the artwork in Laukat's trademark style is fantastic.

This was quite fun. The storytelling is pretty rudimentary, but there's a good game underneath too (which is rare for a storytelling game). If I had one complaint, it's that starting order is wildly swingy - it was strictly worse to go third or fourth on the first turn, as you had less options (and I don't remember if you got a benefit for going later).

Hits the same notes that Castaways did, which was also a huge hit with my wife. Whereas Castaways felt like there was a large unpredictable part of the game outside of the core euro however, Above and Below has a much more predictable story mechanic that doesn't unbalance the euro game underneath. I could imagine my rating of this going even higher with more plays. My only concern is the number of story encounters. Even with the two KS bonus story types I could see them running out quickly.

2015 Kickstarter Expanded (Limited) Edition (proud owner)


A beautiful game! Thick components, very well made!
Have played it once, the gameplay flows really well and the storytelling element will bring something new to the table every time.
When the Expansion stories come out, the game will flourish I think...They will be available on late October, Ryan stated, but till then we have a lot of games in our hands!
Great game, can also be expanded to 1-2 rounds more, because like all of his games, it ends when your "machine" starts rolling...

Apart from that, I think that the game generates endless games and can offer a truly unique storytelling element, which is nowhere to be seen in a previous game, because the results of each exploration can affect the game and the final Village Points. 

That being said, reputation (it can be obtained really through exploring) is not so big a deal in the game, unless two players are really close. Better concentrate on getting the right buildings. The latter, of course, is a matter of exploring. If you do not explore, you cannot build below. 

Above...well, this is just another ballpark. So many buildings to choose from, refreshing the building row is a free action and can really help and, of course, players must focus on getting those key buildings. They are the real Key to the game, where the star buildings, expensive as they are, can boost someone in the endgame or/and steal the win!

Above and Below has a unique vibe. It's fun to strive for the win but you really don't play this as a strategy game. Reading each other passages and rekindling the fun of the old choose your own adventure style stories gives it kind of a campfire feel. 

For me after 10 plays it is a 7, but I give it an 8 for the joy of playing with new players and kids. I don't rate it higher because the randomness and lack of depth prevent it from being a favorite. However it is a game that I will always keep because of the wonderful theme and storytelling aspect. Great to play with older kids, so a keeper in that regard, too. It is currently my 8 year old daughter's favorite game. She gets very excited about acquiring villagers, bed buildings, and going on adventures in the caverns. And I enjoy her reading encounters to me.

As always, great art from Ryan Laukat. The component quality is excellent.

This game which includes a "read the story from the booklet" and decide to roll the dice for one action, or another, combines this mechanic with some fairly minimal purchase cards and obtain resources and/or victory points euro mechanics.  The net result is not bad, just not my style of game.

Above and Below is an absolutely fantastic game by genius designer/artist Ryan Laukat. The beautiful art and sensible graphic design on all components is as expected from Laukat at this point, with everything working well and looking inviting. The game itself is a worker placement in typical Laukat fashion, filled with plenty of options and trials to overcome, forcing the player to capitalize on their actions by choosing when to use which villager to do what things. The game centers around gathering resources, either through buildings or exploring, and choosing when to apply what resources to increase your income and end of game victory points. But the game shines when you go "Below," exploring the caverns, endangering your villagers, and clearing out caves to build powerful outposts in. With many roads to strategies, cleverly told stories, and calculated risk, Above and Below is just another wonderful game that can be easily placed in anyone's collection.

RATING: 7
Feels like a shorter version of Tales of the Arabian Nights. While it lacks the sense of adventure and exploration, the story pieces feel less random and unpredictable; the result of the choices you make typically make more sense.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
We have owned both Agents of SMERSH and Tales of the Arabian Nights. Let's be honest and call a spade a spade. Tales of the Arabian Nights is not a game. It is a choose your own adventure book trying its best to look like a game by adding a board and dice. SMERSH does a bit of a better job by making it a co-op and adding just a touch of strategy & tactics. 
But Above and Below delivers on what most people believed they were getting with those games. Ryan Laukat gives you an actual GAME to go with the storytelling. Worker placement and resource management are key to this game. And there is a very good amount of strategy to it. Gaining resources gets you more money which allows you to build buildings and more workers to get you more points at the end of the game. The exploration action which is where the storytelling comes in is whimsical (written by Ryan and his friends and family) but makes you plan ahead. You need workers to explore successfully. This game only gets a nine because the stories are not as engaging or immersive as they are in Arabian Nights or SMERSH. It more than makes up for that with the game mechanisms but if the stories had a bit more meat to them this game might make it into our top 10.

Not bad since it's more straightforward than most games of its ilk. (By way of analogy, it only has tasks A,B,C to accomplish instead of A,B,C,D,E). However, the paragraphs get tedious quickly, and the tougher options are selected nine times out of ten.

Will only trade with the Expanded edition exclusives that were only available via the  Kickstarter.  Same with the Groves mini expansion as well that was available here on the marketplace. Lastly, the expansion encounter book that was only available in print via the Near and Far Kickstarter.

The artwork! Let my praises sing for the art style of this one! Of course, I love the choose your own adventure style storybook. Such a neat addition. Here's what you know I'm going to fault the game for: replay value. It does get old pretty fast. There are only so many times you can play, before you know the outcomes of the stories. It loses it's novelty, but I still would definitely recommend playing it. It is a worker placement, which automatically means it jumps up the complexity scale. It may be that you have to work newcomers up to this one, so be prepared for the first playthrough to take a good deal longer than normal, as you dig into the strategy behind the gameplay. It will take a decent chunk of time, but I would still highly recommend it. 7/10

Another lovely Ryan Laukat game, mixing elements of worker placement, storytelling, exploration, and even a little bit of potential trade. Love how the Advancement and Reputation tracks work for the scoring, and the specialized characters you can discover from exploring the caves. Also love how you set up above and below ground building rows which give you extra resources and abilities (as they did in Ancient World, etc). Artwork and components are great, and it's cool to see him stretch out and try other niches while retaining his core strength as a designer.

Absolutely fantastic. There are some random elements that inhibit it from getting to the 10 spot but I do not have enough plays in to say if that is truly an issue. Ryan continues to impress me with his elegant and tight design. Story telling via the Encounter book for theme obsessed players, and tight resource collection and building management for the people that just want a good game. In my opinion this hits so many right notes as a hybrid game that I believe it should be in most collections. Really enjoyed this game, and while not my favorite it is definitely staying in my collection.

There are a lot of wonderful things to say about this game. The production quality is top-notch, the artwork is fantastic, the gameplay is fluid, etc. But most significantly, it mixes story telling with more modern game mechanics. And it does so where both elements seem to take an equal amount of time during the gameplay. Thus, for gamers that don't particularly enjoy story-telling, there is still an element that may hold their interest. 

But, I am not this game's audience. I don't enjoy storytelling games and the gameplay mechanics introduce more randomization/luck than I enjoy. For a family gamer looking for something that an adolescent could play and something that wouldn't bore an adult... there is something unique and refreshing here. But for a gamer like me, who is looking for something more competitive/brain-burning/etc, this isn't the game for you.

RATING: 7.5
The âAboveâ part of this game is a lightish but tight civ engine builder. You're starting a new village and will want to recruit more villagers to perform tasks such as harvesting, which produces goods that increase your income each turn and give end game VPs. But your extra villagers will require you to build more homes with beds so they can rest from their labours.

So far so normal, though it is worth adding that the artwork is lovely, with your house cards satisfyingly abutting each other in a line as your village expands, with the dark caverns below them.

What sets this game apart is the âBelowâ element. Underneath your village there are caverns you can send your villagers to explore. If you do so, another player will read aloud a short randomly selected tale from the Encounter Book, which will usually give you a couple of options (eg steal the gold from the defenceless old lady or help her find food; fight the giant rats or run away). You choose an option, and a dice roll plus the ability of your exploring party and some useful luck mitigation decides the outcome.

You could ignore the underground exploring if you want and concentrate on building your above ground village but this will have disadvantages. One route to VPs is advancing along a Reputation Track, which you can only do by exploring, and the encounters if successful can yield money and goods, and allow you to build underground outposts that are cheaper than equivalent homes in the village.

One other element worth mentioning is the way you place goods on a tracker that produces a neat income/VP dilemma: do you want an immediate increase in income, or delay that benefit in the hope of more end game VPs?

Some gamers fond of soulless cube-pushing exercises might decide that the story-telling annoyingly slows down the game (wife's verdict on the stories: "superfluous"), others may think that it transforms a gentle but not exceptional civ builder into something unusually atmospheric, it's just a question of what suits your tastes.

Above and Below is a strange and charming game: a cocktail of lightweight clever resource management and gamebook-style narrative experience.

After my first playthrough, it was just okay cause there seems to be too many mechanics condensed into a game and there isn't enough time to do everything. I like it but don't particularly love it. However, this game really does grow on me and kept drawing me to play again. Probably cause the artwork is an eye candy and multiple pathways to victory (which I love in a game) with an unique take on storytelling. After a few games, I realised there's more depth than I thought and it's meant to be short to create a tense finish, to maximise our engine-building the best we can in a limited rounds.

Plus point, everyone I introduced the game to have only positive things to say about it.

RATING: N/A
Stories are tedious (to us, at least, though some gamers love them evidently), can't do what is needed to help a plan, short-term tactics and little long-term strategy, not enough info to make good decisions ... not our kind of game.  It might be better if we read the entire description of the choices (what reward was on offer for different numbers).

Amazing!!!! I never would have thought that worker placement would go together so well with the "choose your own adventure" mechanic. The mini-stories in the book are well written and give you good options. You can also focus solely on above ground buildings and still be very competitive. An absolute must have. My no. 2 best game from 2015!!!!

RATING: 5
Its my favourite of Ryan's games, but I still didn't really like it.  The tunneling / story bit is super random and even the good things you get could be completely useless in context.  Also, the story element is half-arsed - you have to make a thematic choice based on a paragraph, but results are "get 2 gold."  You get half a story, then a mechanical result.  It just doesn't work for me, I'm afraid.

I remember the first time I saw Tales of the Arabian Nights played and it looked like something I'd not want to do. Partly because of the ridiculous storytelling and partly because of the apparent randomness. Above and Below is a pretty good Euro game with a push-your-luck storytelling part included. I enjoyed it and will play it again. Still, it didn't feel like a game that would get a lot of play in my home so I won't own it.

So... I ended up buying it with my son (8) and he loves the game. It's become a favorite for my wife and I to play also. Pretty good game play with good theming and storytelling. It's fun.

I had given this a 9 rating for a short time and realized that, while I've had some great rounds of this game and really good experiences, it doesn't quite deserve a 9 as a game. I like it quite a bit and the 8 is a solid score for it from me.

Updated review, original remains below.
In my first 3-5 plays I thought there was "some" imbalance. After ten more plays I've realized the game is completely imbalanced, fundamentally flawed, and feels incomplete. First, in terms of balance, there are 2-3 buildings that basically win you the game for building them, and because they are "Star Buildings" they will appear every game. One is worth 12 victory points on it's own. Building this dramatically increases the odds that you will be the winner. Another gives you 2 per villager you have and can be abused pretty easily.

Continuing on the balance front, the exploration aspect is more or less broken. The stories have uninteresting ends, but even more important, there are decent odds that you will spend 2 of your precious actions to get nothing or even lose something from exploring. In my last game I sent 2 characters to explore, rolled successful rolls, and earned the prize of losing two coins. What a game. Punishing the player for engaging in the most interesting aspect of the game.

Aside from this, income is too limited, actions are too limited, and strangely enough the game feels too short. By the time you finally get a decent engine rolling, the game ends. As a result the game feels unfinished. Either they should have made your starting position slightly stronger, or they should have added a couple of rounds. Unless you use a couple of specific strategies, by the time you've dug yourself out of the game's awful starting spot the game will end.

It all adds up to a big shame. This game has some of the most beautiful art I've seen in gaming, and had the stories been better fleshed out it could have been one of the best narrative experiences in light board games as well. Instead you end up with a game that dabbles in too many areas, does none of them well, and ends too soon.

After 5 plays I never wanted to play it again. I've only played it as much as I have because I put it into two "play X times" challenges expecting it to age better.

Original:
Fun game. It does run short on replayability as the stories get told over and over eventually. There also seems to be some imbalance in the mechanics, but in the end, it's still a fun game.

It started off strong with our first play. It created memorable stories to talk about afterward but that has faded now. What was once an enjoyable minor city builder with adventure aspects turned into a greedy resource hoarding game. Perhaps the issue is with the almost frustratingly short game rounds. There are only 5 rounds. You'll want to go on adventures but need villagers but need beds to use villagers but not having enough money for bed cards but needing resources for income but can't go on adventures to obtain free resources. It's almost debilitating when you fail adventures that waste 3 of your villagers; you can't recover and you usually will never catch up.

This has been moved to the bottom of the shelf and is only a fond memory of what it once was.

Were it not for the underground explorations - that add both a little randomness and a hint of much-needed theme - Above anf Below would be just another plain, dry, boring eurogame with no redeeming features: actually, even though the Â«belowÂ» side of the game is far from being memorable, it still helps keep things interesting thanks to the basic storytelling and forced choices it introduces.

My biggest worry was that the story aspect would get stale quickly, but unless you play every weekend it seems like it will take a long time to get through everything. Of course, random chance may cause you to get the same one again every once in a while, but that hasn't bothered me yet. Art work and theme is a 10, but the pacing felt a little slow at first and by the time you get going the game is done. Only played twice though so that may be just getting used to the mechanics.

I love the art of Ryan Laukat games. This one had a lot of potential and I had high hopes for it. But sadly it didn't click. It's a good game but for me it struggles to be euro and storytelling game at a same time and it makes it not really euro and not really story telling. The adventures are just few lines not connected to anything and the choices just give you different rewards without even explaining why. The euro part is simple set collection. Its solid but not exciting. I have to try Near and Far because it might solve the issues I have with this one.

Fun mix of euro point salad engine building and choose your own adventure.  Encourages player interaction with the choose your own adventure aspect.  Lots of fun.  

However, after a handful of plays, it fell by the wayside.  Wouldn't suggest it at a game night but would play it, so I ended up trading mine in a math trade.  Haven't missed it - really love the concept but it lacked staying power.  Hoping Near and Far perfects it.

The exploration stories are so much fun _AND_ there is a tremendously solid game to go along with them!  Each time we play I wish it would go on a little bit longer and I am always willing to play again!  I imagine the storybook took a long time to write, but I would love for every encounter to have written conclusions (both good and bad) as well... we started making conclusions up but they invariably turn into lewd jokes about fish boy ;-)

There was a time I wanted to buy this, based on premise of the combination of euro game and storytelling, but in our group the story part fell flat. You have an encounter (using the story book) and decide based on fluffy parameters to do A (leave), B (go) or C (no guts no glory). Then there's dice determining whether you are successful. Since the euro part is a bit bland also, there's not much left that kept me wanting to play again. It's a shame, because I really like the idea.

Although not entirely my taste, the art is done well and very recognizable of Laukat.

Have You ever played the economic game combined with storytelling motive? Me neither. Have You ever played euro game laughing all the time? Me neither.
I had a chance to play it today and it is awesome. Truly amazing game. It is euro but you have this exploration element that is a jackpot. It is actually only game on the market that mix these two things together. I can't wait to play it again :) 
It must be superb with more than 2 players. In the game for 2 market doesn't work. This is only super small minus.

I enjoy this euro game's story elements. It is light on the story side of things, but the game's mechanics are thematic and it works very well together. This isn't a storytelling game like Tales of Arabian Nights or the like, but you get to make story decisions that will affect your play. This bleeds the line between euro strategy (engine building, action optimization) and storytelling.

Tries to occupy a space between storytelling/RPG/eurogame, and as a result does none of them excellently.

Played thrice, sold, don't miss it at all.

This is a great game. It combines a lot of the elements of Euro games that I like (worker placement, resource management, etc). The thing that makes this game stand out is the story telling aspect. This is both the strength and the weakness of the game in some respects for me. The exploration makes the game very enjoyable and different each play. The only issue I see is long term replay value. I have already run into situations where I've re-read encounters multiple times after 3 or 4 plays. I think this game could do well with expansions and the quality of the pieces and the great development still make this game a great buy and one that should hit the table for you fairly often. Wonderful artwork and a very whimsical fun fantasy feel make this game a great pickup.

I loved this game immediately! Before I even went exploring. But when I first ventured below, boy was I ever sold. Ryan Laukat really shows off his brilliance here with design. My wife, who probably wouldn't identify as a very eager gamer, really hates learning games. However, I convinced her to try this... and then an hour later she was late for an appointment because she just couldn't bear to stop playing before the game was over. Now, the book is a limited resource, so I'm not sure how long we'll both be enamored with this, but for now we are both just digging the immense charm, sleek mechanisms, and immersive play of Above and Below. In fact I don't know if I will ever feel like I am fully "done" with the adventures that the book holds. For now, I find that it is just exactly what I wanted out a lighter Red Raven game, and if that game turns out to be a limited experience, then so be it. It feels worth it for the stories alone, which makes the great game play gravy, so even if I get less than ten games out of this, it will be well worth the cost of admission. If you are on the fence, jump in, what a fun adventure that really FEELS like an "Adventure" even though you are really playing a light euro with very little interaction. What a great disguise!

RATING: 6
Innovative worker/action selection game, with a choose-your-own-adventure aspect. While the theme, art and text are evocative, I found that the decisions you make are not meaningful at all. It comes down to your dice roll, and you take your best results irrespective of the text. It will end up being +2/+1/-1 reputation points and/or one of the 8 resources and/or $1/$2.  So in the end, the narrative really doesn't matter. The story is not tied together or carried through.

Excellent components and a great game. My only fear is that the book could become 'memorized'. Unique game though and definitely worth playing.

We finally got this to the table and it is a blast to play. I can see eventual diminishing returns as the more you play the more you'll become familiar with the scenario book and the rewards/outcomes, but that hasn't been our experience yet as we're still early on in our playthroughs. And the game is gorgeous too.

Magic as every game from Ryan Laukat. Beautiful art and evocative theme. This is a light Euro with some interesting choices, but marked by a high random turnover of events (Random buildings, random cave events decided by random dice results, random followers turnover, random resource collection) which makse the experience more tactical than strategic.

I like it a lot, but my engine builder soul  may take a night out.

I'd like to start out this review by saying, that I've only gotten to play this game once so far and only with four players. When playing with four players you modify the first round into something that's extremely short. It seems like a four player game may not be the best number for this one...

On to the gameplay... I had pretty mixed feelings about this. I thought the exploration mechanic and the encounter book was a really neat idea and well implemented. I didn't really like that your exploration total was determined by a dice roll. Some parts of the game work really well together but some parts feel really tacked on. Overall the gamed seemed really short and we had a hard time getting any kind of engine going. However, when I get this to the table again I'll be playing the game completely different. Money is much more important then it originally seemed. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I'll have to give this one more try before I pass my final judgment, but the mixture of traditional Euro mechanics with random storybook elements (which have wildly unpredictable results) is a big miss for me. 

It feels like it's far more lucrative to simply go for self-evident points (i.e. managing resources) than to go exploring, which can often be a waste of time unless you absolutely need another slot for a building. Maybe if players fall behind, the random storybook rewards would allow them to catch up if they get lucky, but I just don't see the appeal of mixing these two genres, one of which favors more serious strategic play, the other which encourages casual play for laughs.

A nice little engine building game, where you build up your cast of characters with slightly different abilities and your array of buildings that grant you various things in order to best collect resources and other things that are worth the points you need to win.

However, unlike other games of this kind, this one builds in a little story telling element, where you can go adventuring in hopes of finding various resources and treasure. Some people may not like this part of the game, as some adventures are just plain better than others, and the results of your adventure will sometimes come down to a die roll going your way or not. I personally don't mind the random element, but some may find it bothersome.

What keeps this from rating higher for me is that the story telling part felt a little weak. The book presents you with various scenarios, and generally gives you option A or option B, which are usually just an easy thing requiring few successes, or a harder thing requiring more successes. The choice is pretty much always an easy one based on how many successes you think you can roll, as opposed to other story-based games like Tales of the Arabian Nights where you're factoring much more into your decisions. I was left wishing the characteristics of the characters, or what items you had on hand played into these decisions much more.

I was also a bit disappointed in the story resolutions. You get a nicely written description of your encounter to begin with, but then after you roll, you're usually just told you gain something like 5 coins and a rope, without any story or narrative about the result. Just a plain, you rolled 4 successes, so you receive X, which feels like it cheats the story part of the game. In the end, you just have to accept the story part of the game is simply a means to randomly get dealt rewards or setbacks in a way that feels somewhat thematic rather than just plain random. Don't expect a nicely fleshed out story that is tightly tied to your situation and comes to a nice resolution.

I'm a fan of engine building games, so I had fun figuring out what combinations of things would best set me up for success. The game stands pretty well on those merits. I could take or leave the story telling part, as that part is less interwoven into the rest of the game than I'd liked to have seen, but it does add a little extra thematic touch to the game.

Very neat management. Does feel like it ends just as you are getting going but the blend of action selection and story through the game is great fun. Will it last though once you've heard all the stories. Probably, you'll just play less frequently and have forgotten some of the stories. 2 Plays.

Cute game, interesting stories. I love the artwork, it's honestly a lot of the reason I bought the game. Though, i think it's 2 or 3 rounds too short. Every time I've played, I find that once everyone builds up a good engine for exploring, it's the last round and the game is over.

An engine-building point salad game with a dicey story-telling subgame grafted on. It is a pleasant enough game, but I found myself not always making the right move just so I could explore the 'below' section more. And that part is kind of underwhelming. 

That subgame presents you with decisions which are all seemingly 
1) meet a guy - do you help him or attack/steal from him 
or 
2) encounter an item, do you proceed aggressively or cautiously. 

Each option involves a number of dice, so you always choose based on the highest requirement you think you can satisfy, and not based on story at all. It's totally disjointed. 

That said, it is all very familiar and pleasantly diverting to play, but just not a great game.

This seems like an attempt to add actual adventuring to Caverna with the CYOA system, which is a fun idea. But something feels wrong about the engine building in this game because it's so short. The costs vs. returns of some of the cards seem way off. It's still kind of an enjoyable optimization race and the art is cute, but this maybe could have used more playtesting.

Holding off on rating this game because we have really loved playing it and I'm wondering if the exploration stories will get repetitive or predictable over time.

Also, exploration is by far the most fun thing to do in this game, but I'm pretty sure I could play an entire game without exploring a single time and I don't see how it would stop me from winning.

The art and gameplay are solid in this game. The stories work fine integrated with the rest of the game. However, the story rewards are quite random, and there is no story for the reward, which was a bummer. I don't feel I have much control of my actions in the game, but the game is really interesting and needs some more plays to explore more of the paths to winning.

Sweet game, all around. If you like utterly deterministic games, then not for you, as the exploring option is somewhat random. But, if you like the idea of Arabian Nights, yet wish there was a little less story and a lot more game, then this will float your boat.

An interesting storytelling game which has some worker placement and city building thrown into it. While there is strategy around the latter two the storytelling which is the main selling point of this game feels very random to me. You get an encounter which is randomly selected and you try to meet its requirements. The problem is the rewards are completely random and without knowing the rewards you simply guess at which option is best and a tougher reward may lead to less end game scoring for you which makes little sense. At that point the whole story flavor text is kind of pointless to the game, just tell me what my options are and let me roll dice. The rest of the game is decent I just wish the storytelling was better integrated into the game strategy.

Love this game! Only played 2 players with my wife so far but Above and Below has quickly become a regular weekend favorite. The rulebook is a little intimidating at first for newer gamers but it's so well written we picked it up very quickly. It's impossible not too love the whimsical artwork and adventure, and the exploration stories really put you right there in the action. Every game is different as there are so many stories and strategies to persue. Above and below will definitely be a favorite of ours for years to come. Will definitely be looking into more games by Ryan Lauket!

Could well be the perfect game, entirely suited to my tastes. Village building, recruiting people with distinct personalities, exploration, semi-roleplay, collecting / trading goods... all meshed together wonderfully, and with stunningly beautiful artwork. 

Perhaps a few goods tokens with alt. art matching unlocked stretchgoal environments (Under Forest and Desert Labyrinth), those paragraphs printed professionally and offered separately (rather than just as a PDF), the use of cider imposing an exploration penalty, a single good for each kind worth double points (randomly shuffled with the rest of the standard counters), and potential for interaction with marauding raiders... BUT, the designer has acknowledged interest in possibly pursuing these aspects, so... ^_^ But as it stands, a fantastic experience. Bravo to Ryan.

I love the flavor and light (art) in this game. I'm fairly new to the hobby, but I was happy to find a worker placement/ resource management game with such bright and family friendly? artwork. My four year old daughter can play with us (with a little help, of course) and that really just makes the game even better. Any game that can teach my child decision making/ consequences, money management, and turn taking while STILL being enjoyable for the adults is incredible. 

Also, we have played quite a few times and there are still passages that we know we haven't read, so I think that it has a fair bit of replayability and I'm not concerned with getting bored of it.

Between building your town, plumbing the depths of the catacombs, and planning out how to best manage upkeep with villagers... there isn't anything else I want from this game. Well, I'd like to make an insert that takes down the time for setup. I love the decisions you can make on multiple levels. Do you go the safe route by choosing a low roll, or do you go big and break both of your villagers' legs, sending them to the medic?! Great game.

Who would have guessed that melding a "Choose Your Own Adventure" with a tableau builder would result in such fun? The tableau building portion of the game is great - there are all kinds of meaty strategic decisions to consider. But the game really shines when you send your villagers to explore the caverns below your settlement. Other players get to read the various encounters from the story book, which gives everyone a chance to participate (even if it's not their turn). It's sort of like "Tales of the Arabian Nights" with turbo-charged strategy.

There wasn't enough game here for me. Evocative, yes. Beautiful art, yes. But the main choice in the game was a false one. In the story snippets, the better choice always requires more lanterns - so you simply go for it if there's a possibility of attaining the lanterns from your players. There was never a reason to go for anything less than the maximum number of lanterns you might be able to achieve. I traded this for Imperial Settlers.

I really enjoyed this game. The game seems balanced. I liked the theme. The art is cute. The "choose your adventure" thing seemed to work with the game. The little adventure stories were happy and fun. The "explore then build" thing worked with the theme. In fact it all hung together well. I loved the cat character, but it did not come up during my play of the game. The length of the game seemed right for its weight range. I think this is a solid pick for the medium-light weight game category.

Fun worker placement/management game with some storytelling side quests.  When I kickstarted this game I expected more storytelling, or envisioned a game where the storytelling was more prominent.  Not so with this game.  Technically you could win the game without exploring (visiting the storytelling areas).  Fun game, regardless, and with beautiful art.  Game is quick too.

A standard worker placement, set collection game.  Money was to tight and makes the game a little frustrating.  I like building my city (adding cards with powers).  Exploring overall seemed like more risk than reward.  It is ok as a worker placement game and I would play it again.

But wait what about the story book.  Well I enjoy a role playing game at times but the stories in the book just dont matter.  There is nothing wrong with the stories but they have no effect on the game.  You make a choice on how many successes you think you will roll and get something, that is it.

The book seemed tacked on to try to make the game stand out in a new way.  Kudos for trying something new but it did not work.  The stories have to be relevant to the game in a more meaningful way.

This is an interesting game.  It's got a little bit of Dungeons and Dragons (but not enough to make it awkward at all), engine builder, and some dice.

This was described to me as "Agricola meets Arabian Nights", which I'd amend to "Vastly simplified Agricola meets simplified and improved Arabian Nights".

The comparison to Agricola is mostly thematic - you're building a community; there's no feeding, starvation, or animeeples. It's not worker placement per se, but each townsperson can only be used once/turn. Your refresh rate is limited by how many beds your dwellings have, which is a nice touch - "spam more workers" is limited in viability by how many you can refresh.

I like the exploration system better than AN in a variety of ways: all explorations involve challenge, you have moderate control over your success, there's reasonable correlation between skill/effort and reward, there's often a relationship between your story choice and the consequences/rewards, and you always get at least one constant known benefit (building site) for success.

The above-ground community-building portion felt fine, though a bit light for my tastes. The below-ground exploration system was a breath of fresh air - I like it worlds better than AN - but the improvements made me hungry for even more.

RATING: 1
To be fair this is not my style of game, but further than that I want very badly to describe my impression of the gameplay.

Points were assigned to various actions in a very balanced manner, but the game has no hook to provide thoughtful decision rich gameplay. It is a book keeping like management sort of simulation where the rewards seem to always feel to me like of the "oh now I get a point and one fish" type. These rewards are obviously just tacked on to provide scoring. So that we can all pretend that this choose your adventure game plus a management simulation is actually more of a game than it is. That is my accusation. It is not an accusation that the game is not balanced. My accusation is that Above and Below does not deliver real, fun gameplay; and I am particularly sure about this fact for me personally. I would never ask to play this. Literally most average in skill game designers could design the mechanics of this game, and that cannot be said for a fun math puzzle like Feld or Bauza or Stockhausen could make.

Is it really a game? It should be known that I do not respect this game even for what it is trying to be. It feels like it came from Kickstarter and most all of them that come from Kickstarter do.

Further than all of this the random story snippets offend me not because they are written poorly but because no one cared enough to make them linked enough together. It wouldn't be that hard to make them more linked. Longer chains are needed where one decisions affects the next decision in the game more, or maybe I just don't like roleplaying. I don't like bad roleplaying and this is very bad roleplaying to me.

In the past I played action rpg's and mmo's and currently enjoy Dungeon Quest on Android. At least it has gameplay albeit repetitive. Is there a story? No. But I would take decent gameplay over some sort of bad disconnected group of stories any day. 
If you want to make a story in a game don't play at it. That offends me. And don't undertake ambitious projects with ambitious goals and then end up with ordinary results that seem somewhat made for kids. That is just my opinion and it is not going to be an acceptable one.

Components: Gorgeous artwork to differentiate all the cards and tiles. Fun narratives with quite a bit of variety, even given the subterranean setting. My only two complaints with the narratives are a) most of the characters we meet are male, and b) too many of the narratives have âcontinue exploringâ as a counter-choice to the interesting option. I'd prefer if the villagers had names printed on them, to give them more personality.

Experience: Fast playing. One of the few strategy games that plays in the advertised time on the first play. As the game comes to a close we're actually a little sad, because we're just getting rolling.

A simplified worker-placement game, in that there are only five places to put my workers. I like that I can use actions in any order, and those actions aren't being blocked by the actions of other players. Like other worker-placement games, it's a tight economic game, whereby I must execute my actions in an efficient order.

The encounters are fun, with random prizes. I'm not yet certain that they are critical or even central to the game, which is odd given how much work went into them. But they are definitely the highlight. Mechanically, they almost always boil down to âhow many lanterns do I think I can get?â, since there is seldom enough information to glean what the outcome will be from a choice (other than gaining/losing reputation). More is almost always better. I wish the outposts were on the back side of the cavern cards, so that when I explore a cavern successfully I immediately get that reward; as is, I explore for the fun and immediate reward, but I seldom build an outpost because they aren't better than above-ground settlements, especially toward the end when I'm trying to build the start buildings.

Tried a 14-round game; I see now why the game lasts only 7 rounds.

This was the first offering from Red Raven Games that I had any experience with. It took me moments to decide to back the Kickstarter and when it came through, it lived up to my hopes.

The fun combination of storytelling and game mechanics make this game quite different to anything else I've played, bringing a little dash of roleplaying into the mix.

It's easy to pick up, fun to play, the art is all really nice and the quality of components is high.

Off the back of owning this I have back 2 more Kickstarter projects and bought another of their older games. And I don't see me stopping there.

Was hoping for a "storytelling" game a la Tales of the Arabian Nights or Dead of Winter, but that's not what this is. It's a very beautiful, simple worker placement game, where the storytelling enhances the sense of theme. I had a lot of fun with it during my play at Gen Con.

My disappointments: the main one is that the storytelling mostly follows the same structure. In each one, you (1) are read a scenario of what happens when you dig and explore underground, (2) are given a choice of what to do in that scenario, and (3) are given a reward for beating your challenge. I would have much preferred you to be read a storytelling result based on your success or fail in each mission, even if it was a sentence or two. "Do you want to run from the spider or fight?" "I want to fight." "Ok, roll the dice....you succeed, here is a gold." If I was read a result after that that related to the story, I would feel like it was a complete game. I also think that the low number of results in the book (I believe less than 200) will lower its replay value.

In the end, I recommend this as a gateway game for new gamers that are interested in fantasy theme and story before trying something like Caverna. It can be a lot of fun with a good group and has really beautiful art. Also, if you want a game like Tales of the Arabian Nights that is more of a real "game" with good mechanics, this should also fit the bill.

Worker placement game that has a neat story part to the game although failing a expedition could cost you the game and the game feels like it needs to be a couple more rounds longer.  This isn't as strong as some other worker placements but the story element is different making this part of the game interesting. Because of the story element of the game, there is more random results and not much follow up on the stories. Also, there's and unbalanced card action in the game that is an obvious first action for player 1. The stories make this game drag out and ofter there are long periods between plays. This is a pass for my collection although, Id play it if people really want to try it out.

Nicely done euro/adventure combo. There's enough game here to balance the adventure book, but only just enough. Sometimes feels that going on adventures is the real point of the game, but it's usually pretty easy to avoid bad results. Game seems like it might need to be one or two turns longer...about the time you get your town up and running its over. I've enjoyed each play enough to invest in Ryan's other games. Nothing Earth-shattering, to be sure, but a pleasant, fun and beautiful game.

Above and Below is a mashup of town-building and storytelling where you and up to three friends compete to build the best village above and below ground. In the game, you send your villagers to perform jobs like exploring the cave, harvesting resources, and constructing houses. Each villager has unique skills and abilities, and you must decide how to best use them. You have your own personal village board, and you slide the villagers on this board to various areas to indicate that they've been given jobs to do.

A weird mix of choose-your-own-adventure and money/action management over the course of a set number of rounds. The story element is neat if a bit disjointed since the adventures are randomly decided by card flip and dice roll.

This is a good card-based city-builder game with a lot of cool flavor.  It minimizes the focus on victory points, which I think is a plus, and the storyline encounters while exploring underground are really cool.  My only criticisms is the underground encounters can be a little long and repetitive, especially toward the end, and the game is a little long.  We played with 3 veteran board gamers, and it took a little over 2 hours to complete.  Would still recommend, given enough time to play!

Full points for the art on this game. The inventive facial hair alone is worth putting this on the table. The mechanics are good, though I find that the round-limit end-game condition feels arbitrary (and too short in a two-player game). Some of the explore action stories seem a bit odd to me, but then sometimes they line up in rather astonishing synergies. I find it fun to play, but it's not usually my first choice of the games on my shelf.

I like the non-encounter portion of the game but would enjoy the encounter portion much more if it was streamlined. In short, replace the book with a deck of cards like the Other Worlds encounter cards in Eldritch Horror. And, as I've said before, everyone needs an editor, and several encounters should be simplified or jettisoned. The encounter book is an example of unnecessary excess.

One of my best games in 2015. Great story telling fun and keeps me wanting more. Solid mechanic that works well. Even when it's not my turn during the game, I can still enjoy listening to stories which takes away the downtime effect in the game. Love this game!

Have several two player games under my belt at this point. Games are super quick with two players, but plays well. Looking forward to getting some three and four player games in soon!

Update: Just as good with four. Lasts quite a bit longer. Gameplay really doesn't change all that much more with four players other than fighting over buildings and such. Still very enjoyable. Nearly always in the mood for a game or two.

Quite a different game than most others I have tried. I really like the art and presentation. The game is fun too, but the exploring strategy seems weak compared to just gathering stuff. The game is partly for the experience more than winning so didn't bother me that much actually as I explored away even though I knew I wouldn't win by doing it.

A pleasant blending of many familiar recent mechanisms, 

At it's core there's a brief engine-builder that is limited to 7 turns; use scarce cash to buy from the tableau. The main infusion to this core is a paragraph-based choose-your-own-adventure, a la Tales of the Arabian Nights which is used every time you explore underground. 

Tacked onto these two main foundations are a prestige track, where your decisions in the adventuring earn you reputation or infamy. There's a Knizia-like set-collection, wherein you gain victory points for variety as well as plenty, And lastly there's a half-hearted trading element, with little structure or attention paid to it. 

Overall I find this a fun, less math-y, and more evocative alternative to games like Agricola or Le Havre, It adds some color and life to a genre defined by dull exercises in calculation.

Components: deluxe, rules: straightforward, replayability: abundant. A mixture of worker placement, randomness, storytelling, choices and luck. There is no precise strategy; players decide and act depending on resources, man power and luck. The game is innovative, fast and puts players in tense mode. The only downfalls are the randomness and awaiting your turn in a 4-player game. Otherwise, it gives players numerous actions, lots of choices and very many variables each turn. 

I own the Kickstarter edition which definitely adds a lot to the variables, the excellent components and more story telling situations. Worth adding to your boardgame collection.

This is an extremely pleasant game, and I particularly enjoy ee of the mechanisms.

1) The exploration mechanism is the star of the show, and I think there is some nice balance between risk and reward.  I don't think it is at all a "story telling game" as it has been dubbed, but the little stories are more involved than your typical flavor text.

2) The resting mechanism, with three states of worker readiness is very cool and adds an unusual but very welcome element to deciding how to utilize your workers, as well as intersting decisons around building up your "bed" engine. 

3) I enjoy the core concept that you are trying to collect different types of goods, and the most of the goods you add later to your collection. This adds a great element of feeling rewarded when you find a new type of good.  

Overall though, the game feels light for my tastes, and I worry whether it would keep my interest over time. As of now, I'd be very happy to play it some more.  The KS exclusive expansion adds a little more crunch, but also randomness.  KS exclusive gameplay elements are the worst though.  Stop doing this, publishers!

I've played a few Ryan Laukat games now, going all the way back to the original Empires of the Void. I always love the art and graphic design, as well as the worlds he creates.  His is clearly highly talented.  The gameplay is also consistently solid, but so far the total experience has always just barely fallen short for me.  I would very much look forward to the result if Ryan were to someday work with a codesigner or a publisher that could contribute some development expertise.

11/16 Acquired in Trade.
Picked this up because it's a worker placement game (one of my favorite mechanics) with an interesting thematic element (book of paragraphs). 
The game is fun /interesting and the book of paragraphs definitely makes the game more so than a straight action optimization puzzle. I'm a bit concerned that repeating storylines from the book may make it stale - but I suppose we'll have to play it out and see if we hit that point.

A worker placement game with storytelling/choose-you-own-adventure elements.  It very much brought back (happy) memories of âTales of the Arabian Nightsâ(2009, Z-Man Games).  The worker-placement mechanism works well and although the stories are more âeventsâ than any narrative plot, they were enjoyable (hint: from what Iâve gathered, doing the ârightâ thing rewards you, read that as you may).  Perhaps it was the group I was playing it with, but the game felt very relaxing and calming.  It plays leisurely so donât pull this game out if you are in a time crunch or had too much coffee to drink.  A nice âCabin in the Woodsâ game.

Cool light euro game, with story elements that appeal in the same way as Mice & Mystics.

I was hoping M&M would appeal to my kids but each tile devolved into rolling dice against a limited number of minions, with the kids enjoying the item searches most. The campaign aspect wasn't suited to them either. They prefer a beginning and an end.

Above & Below features the explore/discover much more, and the game lasts 7 rounds rather than an ongoing campaign. So this might be the one that engages with my family the most.

Quick comments after one play.

Positive Points
---------------
-Adventuring is fun. The stories are enjoyable and there's excitement/anticipation when going below and resolving lanterns.
- Replayability - the fun in the game is with adventuring and there's 150 stories, you're likely to read 15 or so a game, so there's plenty of stories in there for repeat plays (especially given that our group usually only plays the same a couple of times a year.)

Neutral Points
--------------
- Stories are fun, but there's no closure. You read a cool paragraph, make a decision, then it's like, you get a fish... but what happened... would be nice if there was some closure text for all choices
- Complexity - mechanics are really straight forward, light to light medium game
- Bonus - not sure if this is a negative point yet, but some of the bonus cards looks to be much better than the others and almost essential to winning... needs more plays

Negative Points
---------------
- Not sure on the reputation track... seems entirely random. I fell behind early and had no control over catching up... only thing you can do is adventure and cross your fingers. Wish there was some other way to increase rep... for example, when you work

Overall
-------
Above and Below is a light game that blends together Euro mechanics and story telling fun. The adventuring system is very engaging and lifts the game to one that I would play most anytime. Rating it a 7.25 for now.

Above and Below is a mashup of town-building and storytelling where you and up to three friends compete to build the best village above and below ground. In the game, you send your villagers to perform jobs like exploring the cave, harvesting resources, and constructing houses. Each villager has unique skills and abilities, and you must decide how to best use them. You have your own personal village board, and you slide the villagers on this board to various areas to indicate that they've been given jobs to do. Will you send Hanna along on the expedition to the cave? Or should she instead spend her time teaching important skills to one of the young villagers. I love games with multiple ways to victory. This game definitely stood out in 2015!

The game as the rules suggest is too short for 2 players, and the ending is very anti-climactic.

I house-ruled it with the Pioneers variant and it works better for me/us

Everyone seems to agree that its basically what Arabian Nights would be if it were a game. The actual game is still somewhat lackluster. 

The components and art are all very nice. Everyone liked the decision point on goods stacking. The stories book is very nice and the adventures are written well and of a reasonable length.

Unfortunately the stories don't add very much to the game play. Typically you just choose whichever one you can reasonable do. It all seems to boil down more to the luck of the draw than anything else. 

The rest of the game play is a pretty basic worker placement game. You recruit more workers, buy buildings and collect goods for victory points. I will say, I like the beds concept to slow to effectiveness of building more workers. Everyone also liked the decision point between placing goods to make more money and saving the common goods until you can place them on a higher point value space.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I understand why people love this game, but it is not my style. I find that some of the buildings are wickedly overpowered, and lock players into obvious, and reoccurring strategies. Also, when exploring, higher roll requirements always yield better payouts, thus preventing players the opportunity to create and explore their own stories, at least not without sacrificing theirscore. This is a disappointment considering the story aspect is the game's hallmark feature.

Well, this one certainly gets points for uniqueness. One minute youâre planning to buy a new building or acquire a new worker and the next youâre reading a paragraph to your neighbor a la Tales of the Arabian Nights. I found the game refreshing simply for being different from the usual euro fare. 

The main attraction from the euro aspect is managing your workforce. Only some workers can perform certain tasks, and while you can purchase new ones each turn, they have to rest. That is, you have to purchase new buildings with beds such that they refresh for use the next turn. Buildings also offer resources or bonus powers, so you build your own worker and building engine while still managing to go exploring.

Exploring offers you choices of what action to take without knowing the rewards via a paragraph your neighbor reads to you. Then you roll some dice to see if youâre successful. Buildings that offer reroll powers are a good idea here because you simply cannot afford to fail even one exploration. The texts that you read to each other were entertaining in my first game, however, theyâre totally athematic. I mean, youâre told how many successes you need for each choice and make your decision based on what you think you can reasonably achieve. Canât even possibly get 7 successes? Well then, I guess youâre doing the choice that requires 3 successes.  

So is it successful? The euro elements seem to work well enough but the exploring introduces a big helping of randomness both with what type of encounter your draw and whether or not youâre successful. You can send 3 of your 4 dudes exploring so as to increase your odds of success but only pull a minor encounter that doesnât pay out much even for succeeding at it. So much for that turn. Since the game is so short â the full 7 rounds feel like the mid-way point â I feel like the person who has the most successful explorations will win. Careful planning and management of your workers can only take you so far. 

Itâs a hard game to assess after my one play so far, but I do want to try it again to see how much player agency there is versus luck. My gut says there's 2-3 plays here max before the gimmick wears off.

We really enjoyed playing this game, but our one complaint keeps it from being higher on our list: it's too short to really feel like you can get your engine online.

The game itself seemed pretty solid - a good mix of different buildings available, the sleep-injured dynamics of your workers, variable worker powers... lots of good game in there.

Then the adventure book.

Dedicate some number of your workers to go try to take on an adventure, without having ANY CLUE AT ALL what the potential rewards might be.  Once you go there, chuck some dice to see if you get anything.  Even in Eldritch Horror you at least know that you're likely to get spells if you do a city encounter in Arkham.  Here, you have no clue at all until after you've dedicated your workers.  It really rubbed me the wrong way, and the story bits weren't even really engaging - just some generic fantasy trope text and then a generally obvious choice between an easier thing with likely crappier rewards, or a harder thing with a better reward.

This is another that I'd play again, but the cave adventures part just didn't feel like they meshed well with the rest of the game.  I usually enjoy Ameritrash / Euro hybrids quite a lot, but in this case I'm not so sure.  I did have fun with it, but it felt like it was missing something to make it special.

Really interesting mix of worker placement and story telling. I wasn't sure these mechanics would mesh but they do really well. 
I would like to explore this more.

Actually I really really enjoy this one. Its so simple mechanically that it is very easy to just pick up and play. The worker mechanic whereby they become exhausted after performing an action and you must provide them with a bed to rest in in order for them to become useful again is really quite novel and I do like it. 

The 'below' part feels a little like a win more mechanic, as you tend to get a bit of everything if you explore repeatedly however if you keep finding nothing really with your explorations it can serious dent your scoring chances. 

The storytelling part (exploration) is well done but it doesn't take over, each paragraph is a story in and of itself.

It stales in comparison to Tales of the Arabian Nights, which is a real shame. I think a big part of it is that there is no resolution to the stories, you just receive a combination of different goods and/or reputation. The adventuring mechanism itself is very nice though and I don't mind that the the outcome of the stories can vary greatly.

A very cute and light Euro with a storytelling twist. The art is great and was what first caught our eye. The stories that come with cave exploring really bring a sense of personality and theme to the game, although how much the rewards will help you is very random. While overall quite good, I get the feeling that there is a conflict between playing to win and playing to simply enjoy the ride.

More of a personal note: it was when considering buying this game that we started our BG geekness!

Looks amazing - I love the artwork.  It's worker placement with resources and there is a little deck building in there too (character and buildings) so a good mix of mechanisms.

TO me, the game doesn't feel completely rounded.  By this I mean some of the elements feel underdeveloped.  The deck building element seems a little weak as for all the amazing imagery, there's little of use bar a few symbols on the cards and these aren't character or building specific and can be easily found on many other cards.

More an observation than a criticism, but I found myself playing the story adventures to maximise the rewards more than making the politically correct choice. Some of the better rewards came from making the less thematic choice.

And finally, I think a score pad should have been included and I'd recommend that for a 2nd edition run.

This game is pretty solid. I really like the goods advancement track, choosing between income now or points later is tough. Everything besides the storybook is pretty solid but not exceptional. I like the storybook but I wish there were conclusions and that stories tied together now. Looking forward to near and far.

It's a nice looking worker placement game, but I feel the storytelling part was a bit disappointing. I was  expecting something more and with some consequences to the choices, more then do I get 3 coin or do I get 6 coin. The mechanics are fairly good if a bit on the lighter side.

Excellent artwork design with great game mechanism. Well mix of worker placement, item accumulation and adventure story telling. We enjoy the gameplay so much.

Only one thing that we want the game to be fixed in the next version is it spend too large playing area. So reduce card size could be helpful.

Lovely art and feeling to the game. Really good to see someone attempt some proper storytelling.

Don't like that the part of the game that drives the storytelling is the part that relies on too much luck, leading to players sometimes feeling like lost something because of a die roll rather than being able to enjoy the story.

I really like the idea of this game, a story telling game with euro elements. The art is loving and exploring new stories is fun.

However I feel the mechanics of the townsfolk/buildings and story telling could have been done better and would have really made me love the game.

I don't like how the stories aren't so much based on your decisions but by your expected success rate. It's almost always better to go for the highs value you can get. I also wish they included little favor text for success or failure

Also the game seems to end right as your engine is starting to get going (getting people/buildings/beds/resources)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Design is top notch and I like the idea that you build a village above and explore the caves below it along the way. Sadly the events during exploration und the reward you get (or dont get) are to random. Therefor "Above and Below" can not be played seriously. I reckon its great fun with kids. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A sweet and somewhat short game where actions are few enough to be significant without being too few.  Exploration mechanic adds a touch of randomness but also huge amounts of atmosphere.  A beautiful combination of tight deterministic play and a hint of story.  Gorgeous artwork too!

I was mildly impressed.  After being disappointed with City of Iron, the designer has come up with a much better game.  I think there are still some wrinkles to it and not much in terms of decisions to be made each turn (for example, at the end of the game, many of your workers will be tied up harvesting, reducing your options greatly), the game is visually appealing and fun.  Definitely worth playing again.

RATING: 6
Played one learning game so far. Charming art, cute stories, even if the results aren't in narrative form. Not sure how I feel about gameplay so far. I think I like it, but will need more plays to get a feel for what's working and what's not, if anything.

Update: Not sure how to describe it, but it left an odd feeling, and didn't have us wanting to go back to it. The art is nice and whimsical--I really liked the villager tiles, but I wasn't too keen on the board. The stories, as people have mentioned, feel kind of cut off, since the results don't tell you what happened, just what rewards you get. I think for a true story experience we'd rather play Tales of the Arabian Nights, and if we're in the mood for building a city or playing a worker placement game, we'd rather play something else. It just left kind of a hollow feeling. This one does a little of everything, but the sum of the parts didn't amount to be something we wanted to go back to.

Update: I think the two parts don't really mix, storytelling and euro / resource-management. I found myself wishing the stories went by more quickly (even though I love storytelling games), because I'm trying to get on with the game itself. It's an odd back and forth in terms of pacing and tone.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Beautiful game but seems way too long. Not sure if the adventure book adds much to the game as all the choices seemed very straightforward: use larger exploration values to get better rewards. We got a few laughs out of it but it's the same as rolling dice for resources - just drags the game longer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Really love the story-element and the art. It's fun to encounter and decide what to do. 
In all it is a medium-light game, which might suffer from lack of replayability because you get to know the stories. If you are not particularly fond of adventuring and story-telling, this game might fall flat for you.

I feel like this game did a good job of mixing a story telling mechanic with an engine building strategy game. Getting goods seemed like a harder way to win, and if you play it strictly as a competitive game based on building an engine, I think it doesn't hold up all that well. But for what it tries to do, I thought it was a nicely made game.

the only reason this doesnt get a 10 is its slightly simplistic, the randomness of encounters can easily skew it in someone elses favor, and because of the lack of resources, you usually have to plan on what big house to buy right at the beginning as well as your strategy. There isnt alot of room to adjust. 

with that out of the way, play this game! if you are a non solitare kind of person this game might not be for you. Or maybe it is for you! My sister hates solitare like games because she plays games so she can interact with other people. In this game it is possible to block other peoples moves with your own actions, but what really makes it fun is if you have an imagination!

When you go exploring they give you a little story text about your encounter. But the text normally doesnt give a resolution, just a reward. So we like to make up our own stories in relation to the text given and the reward recieved. For instance, my sister command her forces to fight to the bitter end, for the greed was strong, and the treasure chest tempting. But the skeletons out numbered them. They faught valiantly to sedate their leaders greed, but at the cost of their blood... (she injured them to insure succes xo). 

so yeah, its fun

update: this is a fun game, but there isn't alot to it. The game feels a little to light for the time I invest in it. I'll never turn a game down, but I won't go out of my way for it

Neat little action selection style game.  Not truly worker placement, as your workers don't block another player from an action.  

There are more options and more meaningful decisions to make than I was expecting when I backed it on Kickstarter.  I mainly backed it because my kids love Tales of the Arabian Nights, and this looked to be in the same vein, but with more game attached.  

I think there's a bit less story here, but a lot more game.  It's really well done, with more meat than I expected.  

Components are all top-notch as well.

Cute, and fairly thematic.  The first game takes a while, but after that, a two-player game isn't crazy-long.  Randomness is fairly high, but each game can play out pretty differently due to random scarce resources and a frequently changing roster of buildings.  Random encounters add a fun touch, though they're very short, like Arkham Horror.

The story paragraph thingies are reasonably diverting, but the overall game is exceptionally light and random.

Definitely my favorite of Ryan's games so far.  The first one I have wanted to play a second time, and actually enjoyed it more on replays.  The adventure book addition to an otherwise bland euro really makes this game stand out for me.  I love that type of narrative element in games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
A compromise between a paragraph reading game and other elements intended I guess, to give folks who like storytelling and those who don't something that they can play together. I would prefer more reading and more connection between the paragraphs to obtain a more cohesive narrative with an overarching storyline. The other elements do not interest as much. Otherwise the storytelling is not bad and the rest is at least fairly clean. Counting game turns provides a forced and unnatural finish. So 6 for me.

Neat game with a light euro feel. The stories are fun. I think the game has a limited shelf life as after a few plays you've seen all the stories, and the lack of really meaningful decisions begins to show.

Oh god no. At its core there's a half decent game here... but the story element ruins it. It felt more like roleplaying in that regard.

RATING: 6
First and Foremost, the game is beautiful to look at and the mechanics are sound. Ryan Laukat is truly a prodigy in that he publishes, designs, and makes the art for all his games. The man is truly talented.

What makes this game different than a typical worker style building game, is the inclusion of a story book which adds a bit of theme in an otherwise typical Euro game. The stories are well written and all, but I feel they could've gone more in-depth with what gets presented to you. It usually pretty obvious which path to take and the rewards you get are ok with only a handful actually nabbing you a special worker or the like. 

I'm on the fence on whether I should keep this one or not... A new adventure book, with greater rewards and harsher penalties for exploring the unknown would be great, but as it stands, the main "pull" this game has, is ok at best.

Update: Sold this one off, which hurt a bit cause I like the game portion of it, but the story-telling is just lacking. The game is 90% game driven, and about 10% story driven, which is not what I was looking for.  I hope a really good balance can be found in a game, that brings these two mechanics together in a great way without being too long, and have a strong story-telling element as well.

An entertaining way to pass time, but not much of a game in terms of actually making a strategy.

The storytelling element of the game is when you decide to send some of your workers to explore an underground cavern. It seems like you will want to do this at least 1-2 times because you need an explored cavern card to be able to build an underground building ("outpost"). 

Which fine, that is whatever. Except the swing on what reward you can get from a successful mission can vary so much. At least the options make enough sense--helping someone tends to help your reputation, running away hurts it, etc. But the rewards are random. One mission you might get a low scoring resource you already have, which essentially was a dud turn for several workers, while another mission might reward the player a handful of gold.

This game is just incredibly charming.  The storytelling element is important to the game--both mechanically (it's about as important as adventuring is in Caverna, but much more narratively interesting)--and thematically (it turns out that the adorable characters need to make actual moral decisions, and they aren't always *nice*, and there are hints at what the values of their society are.  But that isn't the whole game--it's very well integrated with this interesting resource management/engine building game in a way I find really intriguing.  The length of the game is just about perfect--and so is the tone. Love it. (2 plays)

Was very excited to play this, but was disappointed in the story part. After much thought I think the reason is that the decision given to the player comes at the end of the story, and then there is no aftermath described, which is a let down nearly every time.

For example, there was a great story about the team coming across a giant cat and having to decide whether to run or fight.  My opponent decided to fight the cat which was a difficult choice as it was the highest lantern count, rolled well and succeeded.  The effect was gaining a rope and a lose a reputation...  There was no explanation, no story about the battle or  where they found the rope, or later found out perhaps it was the pet of the underground people.  

It felt that each story was only half told each time.

Half-way decent mix of worker-placement and storytelling. The stories are less CYOA, and more RYOA (which is to say, dice-rolls determine which choice you can make, because there's always a better and worse option, and you always want the better one if you can afford it), so they're pretty paltry from the exploration perspective. And it seems like a player who's mainly down to hear a story is going to get annoyed by all the Build-Your-Own-Town stuff going on concurrently.

Phenomenal production values all round, and lots of replayability. It might be your thing, but it isn't ours.

Very fun game. The encounters (exploring) really add a nice touch to the game. You have a several options each turn so there is some thinking / strategy on how you will allocate your villagers. There is also a little risk in each encounter so you can press your luck and hope for something really good or play it safe and settle for something smaller. Sometimes going for it all and failing can lead to something bad though. We got a few laughs out of our villagers misadventures! It is great if your group really gets into the encounters and makes them a part of your village identity. I now regret not backing Near and Far. Above and Below is a lot of fun and plays in less than an hour for 2 players.

*** Bumped up to 9 after my second play. love this game! Lots of options. I love exploring and the feeling of the old school choose your own adventure books.

CON:
I don't feel like the game is completely connected to itself. Part of me wants to go adventuring, and part of me wants to play solely by building cards and collecting resources. I don't feel like the strategic element meshes well with the adventuring element. The randomness and variation to what you can gain from adventuring can be frustrating as well. 

I personally wish the game lasted a little bit longer, Just as a feel like i got the ball rolling so to speak, the game seems to be in the last or second to last round.

Beautiful art and great theme mix together for a really good game. Your village was burned down and pillaged by barbarians so you're trying to build anew only to discover a series of caverns underneath your new village. The adventures are probably the best part of the game and each one is different as every time you go exploring you get a different set of adventure text from a book that comes with ~200 of them. Each story is very well written and the choices given sometimes make you think twice due to the reputation track.

Box says about 90 minutes but it seems to go by a bit quicker than that if you've got people that do their turns pretty quickly.

A worker placement game with attractive art and light but solid mechanisms. The storytelling aspect of the game was fun but not as well developed as I would have liked.

RATING: 6
The adventure book adds a pleasant push-your-luck twist, and the trade-off between playing resources early for income or saving then to maximise end-game points is neat.

Otherwise standard Euro / worker / action / convert-resources-into-points stuff with very little interaction other than taking a card or tile to deny it to someone else.

My initial rating:9

I think that this is an essential game for those gamers who love story telling. This really does bring a lot of imagination to the table and the stories are very evocative.

I'm pretty sure my rating will change but this game got my fiancÃ© to say for the first time that she really liked a game (FINALLY!).  

January 16th 2017 (changed rating from 9 to 10): 

I will never change my rating! This game is now my favorite to play. It is easy to play, no analysis paralysis, engaging rich stories to read, economical for euro players, and the art is inviting! I never felt like it was ever boring (Gameplay or story). I am a huge fan now. And best part is that my fiancÃ©e loves it. She was never enticed by the other games in my collection, but this finally has her excited!

This seriously is a work of art; in game design and aesthetics.

January 10 2018 I think it's still a great game that can be kept with Near and Far. This gives me that village building satisfaction. But I don't think it's my favorite game of all time. But I can still see myself still playing this in the future.

2016-12-26 - This is easily my favorite game with a big story book. It has a lot more interesting decisions than Tales of the Arabian Nights and Agents of SMERSH. It's still a really light game, though, and maybe not quite interesting enough for me to want to play it very often.

RATING: 6
A unique mix of story look-ups and resource engine building. The two parts of the game (exploration and building) do not feel particularly integrated. The exploration is enjoyable, although the writing of the story paragraphs is uneven. A couple of things for this game that struck me:

One, the exploration is the most fun part of the game, but unless it is a specific goal for you, it won't win you the game. In fact, the rewards are often minimal and pedantic and I debate whether they are worth the risk. It is easy to get sucked into doing what is fun, but it doesn't really give you points. If you are lucky you'll get an indirect bonus, but the main thing is getting a building site out of it. This seems strange to me.

Two, I didn't feel like any of my decisions were all that interesting. There were no interesting quandaries to figure out or greatly differing strategies or no affects by other players that forced me to rethink things. Early in the game you target a bonus card to acquire and you start building and collecting to support the bonus you plan on taking. This is pretty much your strategy because there isn't room to switch gears and diversifying (in resources or workers) doesn't reap much in return. So you pick pretty early what your specialty for that game will be and spend the game maxing out on it. Exploration is a push-your-luck mechanic that you should try to minimize your exposure to as much as possible (unless exploring is your goal). This makes the game feel pretty static and scripted once your path is chosen. With only 7 rounds, you'd better choose your goal quick!

Every turn I didn't go exploring I felt disappointed. No adventure! Every turn the game was asking me to make a choice: go have fun or win. I've never had a game ask me that before.

The story piece feels under-developed to me personally and the rest of game is quite standard. As with all of Laukat's games, the artwork is outstanding.

I love this game. This is seriously one of the most fun board games I've ever played. It's a worker-management game where you build up a small village. You can send workers on tiny adventures that are read to you from a book which prompt you to make choices like "Do you do A? Or do you do B?" The only reason I'm listing it as a 9 is that the stories start becoming recognizable over time.

Giant flavortext booklet was nice, but disconnected from the plot. Scythe has a simplied version of this, apparently the booklet of random  happeninging was repeated in the sequel to this game without any improvement, which is a shame.It was a great challenge to take on, so I hope he gets to that spot he really wants to get to. I admire the game, and the risk.

NOTE: You can read and comment on these thoughts on my blog: https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/48839/above-and-below-sortof-reveiw 

You stumble into a cavern filled with the reverberating sound of stone dice being tossed. Huddled around a central table made of polished obsidian are four grayish figures you recognize as glogos. Hearing you approach the nearest glogo gives you a fleeting sideways glance and a dismissive nod before returning their attention to the contents of the table. 

As you observe them you realize they are playing a game involving dice, the goal of the game eludes you.

Hearing the clatter of boxes the glogos turn and advance on you. As you're running away you take comfort in the knowledge that you didn't leave anything valuable behind. [/o]


------------- break 1 -----------------
[o]You patiently observe the glogos and after a time determine the structure and goal of the game. The goal is to gain the most points but the glogos who are most engrossed in this aspect of the game appear frustrated. They are often complaining that the random nature of the game means they cannot adequately plan or strategize. Their counterparts however are equally engrossed in the brief moments of storytelling and appear just as unsatisfied. Each time there is a story element they excitedly flip to the appropriate passage and with great theatrical flair read a snippet of story. At first they seemed pleased but as this is repeated you notice that the bland predictability of the text is annoying them. They become bored with the choice to HIDE or FIGHT, CONVINCE or FIGHT, PROVOKE or BE PROVOKED. Additionally they seem disappointed by the lack of a connecting narrative.

This one might creep up a bit for me with continued plays, but even as-is it's a standout game. It's not as inventive or laugh-out-loud funny as something like Tales of the Arabian Nights, but as a GAME it plays SO MUCH BETTER. Systems are fun while still giving some weighty decision making opportunity and while it's competitive, there's almost no spite. The game overall is a LITTLE light on direct player interaction but is still great. Also, 'dat art though.

Above and Below has the kind of whimsical artwork that appeals greatly to me, and it's an enjoyable enough experience, I suppose, but it seems to lack for me much tension or engagement, and, for an engine-building game, it seems to run fairly short in terms of numbers of rounds.

RATING: 6.5
Interesting concept merging standard worker placement with an adventure book. However, the game felt too random for my liking, its focuses on doing encounter yet most encounter felt like "GO BIG or GO HOME". If the reward suits the strategy you are going with, you snowball "HARD" (Especially the 1st or 2nd encounter you do during the first few rounds). Otherwise it just hinder your strategy.

Also, there is there is no control over your rewards unless you memorize the whole encounter book, which i believe is against the spirit of the game.

RATING: 7.8
Unique blend of light engine-building, pseudo worker placement, and charming (but basic) story-telling/adventuring. Overall, a good game, but a few issues keep it from being a great game.
1) Roll-to-resolve during Explore actions is like "fingernails on a chalkboard" to me. Even with an option to boost poor rolls, random failures can still happen and are completely demoralizing, especially when a failed Explore in the early rounds all but guarantees you can't win the game.
2) The game ends just as the activity in your village starts picking up. Understandably, the game is designed to be an engine-builder with a limited scope to ensure a reasonable play duration, but it feels like the game winds down a little too soon.
3) Although there are multiple, viable paths to victory up through mid-game, the endgame requires a single strategy to be in contention for first place (in my limited experience, winning requires hoarding money over the last few rounds in order to purchase a star building).
4) After several plays, the stories start to become repetitive and predictable.

There's definitely a game here, but most of this is about the experience you can craft with your characters and the story you can tell.  Components and art are beautiful.  I love the Choose Your Own Adventure aspect.  Quests are really where this game shines.  Without the story telling, which will be good or bad based on the crowd you play with, you'd probably have a fairly bland experience.  But with the right people, it's magic!  A great starter story crafting game for children too.  The designer has given you a wonderful canvas, it's up to you to paint the picture.  I highly value that!

It was too unbalanced. Luck/unluck dice roll influenced the game a bit too much and the re-rolling cards was to powerful (maybe some house-rules can fix this). Some of the card combinations gives to much end-game scoring. I really enjoy the story-telling part but it was writen in to difficult English for me and my game group.

Played at my FLGS and found this cute but I have some issues with it. After one play I find the exploration and the worker placement parts to be not really connected. Also the new workers you get seemed to be really similar. After a couple of plays you can really know if the outcome gives you +reputation or -reputation and can manipulate the storytelling part. In Near and Far you might want to get low on reputation to play artifacts but in this there is no real benefit for going in the negative. Overall it is a fine game to play once in a while but I don't see myself buying it.

RATING: 7.5
Interesting worker-placement game with a story-telling element in a paragraph book of adventures with choices and challenges (similar to Tales of Arabian Nights or Agents of SMERSH).  I found myself more interested in wanting to adventure to see what will happen next rather than optimizing my play to win.  heh

Great mix of euro with RPG. 
Particularly, the RPG aspect is fascinating adding a fresh feeling.
It would be great if the game was easier to grasp as it has quite a lot of relations and whole lot of icons to understand. If not this issue it would be 10.

Highly recommended to play.

I know I'm in the minority, but I just don't find Lauket's games intriguing. Above and Below feels like a game that doesn't do anything quite well enough. The strategy is limited by the luck of exploration. And the story is too terse to develop a connection with the characters.

This may very well be my new favorite game. I want to bring it to the table a half a dozen more times to really figure out what sort of rating I will give it. But, as it stands, it's a 9 at the very LEAST. Beautiful art. Simple, efficient engine mechanic. This is NOT a worker placement game. So many folks within BGG have been writing that it is. That makes me wonder if they even understand what a WP game even is. The storytelling aspect - while minor - really adds quite a bit of theme to the game. Ryan has turned me into a believer of his work.

Stupid me had this backed on Kickstarter but wife and I were saving to move so I had to back out. Kicking myself now as this has become one of our favorite games we have every played. Everything about this game is simply amazing. From the choose your own adventure aspect of it, to how well it works as a two player game, to the decisions you have to make every round. While not a difficult game to understand, the decisions that need to be made every turn really do matter.

Cannot say enough about how much the wife and I enjoy the game!!

A slightly too fiddly buying-and-building game, built on top of yawningly random caverns where you feed dice into a one-armed bandit to get back unpredictable resources. And the book of tales seems oddly bored of its own storytelling, every resolved encounter ending with a flat "2 gold" or "1 pot" rather than even a sentence of narrative.

Good, but not compelling.  If I didn't have lots of worker placement games already I'd probably be interested in getting this. Artwork's nice.  Like the rest/injured mechanism.

Not too complicated, but scoring is a bit weird as mostly everything you do will net you points minus a few exceptions (unless of course you get the right cards).  Some luck needed via the explore action, but can be mitigated by the characters you choose. Not bad.

RATING: 9
Worker assignment with tight choose-your-own-adventure roleplaying.

To be clear: No expansions are necessary for this to be a blast. However, I look forward to expansions adding to the story and to the variety of strategic paths (and to be clear on that point, too: I believe the strategy has abundant variety, but the basic paths to victory are only two or three and that could be expanded).

Also: I do not think roleplaying skills are in anyway necessary to the fun or execution of the game, however, letting loose with our own attempts at improv was incredibly fun! It's a very safe environment to practice the skill.

The juxtaposition of the strategic resource collection with the choose-your-own-adventuring is not only theoretically awesome but is actually awesome.

Highly suggested.

Don't let the amount of items and board set up intimidate you if you are a casual board game player. This game is fairly straight forward and by your 1st or 2nd game, you will not only know the rules but start seeing the different strategies you can take. One of the best aspects of the game is that it is highly enjoyable even with only 2 people. The encounter system works in bringing a unique experience every time you play and gives the game the extra difficulty and danger it needs. If they add more encounters, I will be playing this game for a while.

01-08-2016 - Got this one in with the fam over New Years.  I really liked it a lot.  It's not the best "game" in the world, the decisions you make often end up in pretty random results, but who cares?  It's fun to put together your little village, go out exploring, and have little adventures with at least some kind of decision to make.  We all had fun with it and that's the most important thing.  8.

This games goes in two completely different directions, and they don't fit very well together. The story telling is funny. The worker placement is decent if your are into that kind of thing. Sadly the mix just doesn't work. The storytelling aspect is too random to fit in with the rest of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fairly straightforward game that is easy to learn (in my opinion) and pretty. Really enjoy the storytelling which is a critical part. It's too light to rival a serious worker placement but should work well for the groups wanting easier games.

After 3 games I'm still trying to hone my strategy although it looks like the key is to Explore going for the big rewards, smaller rewards offer little to no payoff. E.g you can get 2 coins and a cider just by Labouring, without the risk of exerting.

Above and Below is a mashup of town-building and storytelling where you and up to three friends compete to build the best village above and below ground. In the game, you send your villagers to perform jobs like exploring the cave, harvesting resources, and constructing houses. Each villager has unique skills and abilities, and you must decide how to best use them. You have your own personal village board, and you slide the villagers on this board to various areas to indicate that they've been given jobs to do. Will you send Hanna along on the expedition to the cave? Or should she instead spend her time teaching important skills to one of the young villagers?

I actually liked it and would like to play again with the quests and advanced mini expansion modules. While the roleplaying text WAS largely superfluous, your group can have fun with it if you want. The RNG of questing can be a bit frustrating at times and spoils the perfect balance of a pure Euro experience, but it's an interesting middle-ground between Euro worker placement with a touch of Ameritrash theme and RNG.

RATING: 6.5
There are some clever solutions here, both mechanically and artistically. Exhausting characters to bed is both intuitive and lovely and while I'm not personally big on set-collection, here it's at least very functional in how it defines your income. Though it also means one resource is as exciting as every other, which is not very.

The adventure book is nice and all, but it's a very random addition to the game. I feel it lacks some kind of influence over going underground. Say I only want some mushrooms, it shouldn't necessarily be as troublesome as going spelunking for ore.

I did get the kickstarter-exclusive book and chits and they do help with more options and a better game, so it's a shame they're not readily for sale (rating should probably reflect this 0.5-1 step higher...).

It's nice and comfortable, but I can't help feeling it should aspire to be something just a tad grander.

Beautiful and narrative game with an adventure book a la Tales of the Arabian Nights.  Play is simple and fast while retaining some depth.  Some buildings are very powerful (read borderline unbalanced) and can really upset the balance but the proceedings are fun and pleasant even if you don't win.  A bit too random & whimsical for my taste but an uncommon mix of mechanics, narrative and ambiance.

This game is awesome. There are a few issues that we have come across. 

1. The cards that allow you to hire a worker without making them rest before using them seems to be over powered. 

2. We are already regularly running into the same stories. I would love a replacement book that would have all new stories. Maybe a fan expansion will show up soon...

Beautiful game. There's not a lot of player interaction which I actually really like since I'm not usually the biggest fan of competitive games. I love the idea of the stories but I wish they were better integrated into the game. Some choices are a bit too obviously either "good" or "bad". I would've liked to see a bit more risk over which path you choose to take. Heavily considering Near and Far, especially with the Amber Mines expansion which I heard has a coop mode.

The storybook was a nice idea but I don't think that well integrated. While there does seem to be enough incentive to explore fairly frequently and also there is consistency between the stories' universe, the non reputation and cavern rewards felt really random. Not necessarily in an unbalanced way, but in terms of what goods tokens and money you got. That all the tokens do the same thing really hampers the exploration feel, making me generally never really excited about my reward. Outside the flavor text it felt more like a speculative euro resource gathering method rather than exploration. I also didn't like you couldn't really choose what type of adventure you went on or it didn't build on your previous adventures, preventing the generation of an overarching narrative. Still enjoyed it, but much room for inprovwment.

As a euro game, the way the workers work in terms of their strength in exploring and being able to build and recruit, along with the way they refresh through beds felt polished. The set collection of goods however felt pretty pasted on, and the lack of a sliding buy row for the buildings I felt like made acquring the optimal one too swingy. Overall not bad but kind of mediocre as a medium-light euro.

As always Laukat's art is great, and here the iconography was quite intuitive.

If this game were just worker placement, it would be mediocre at best. However, it's the storytelling that really sells the system. While it's not as deep in terms of choices in a game like Arabian or Smersh, it does require some risk to get your rewards, which makes you play differently and choose what you build differently.

Of course, it also has Ryan's amazing art, which is always easy on the eyes.

Worker placement game with odd storytelling tacked onto it.  Unlike Tales of the Arabian Nights, there actually is strategy to some of this game.

It makes for an awkward juxtaposition, and if anything wants me to play Tales of the Arabian Nights again for the grander experience.

One of the best WP games I have played.  Great components, I even like the little touches like the fact that you can choose the looks of your starting workers.  Most of all it does not feel stifling for a WP (many options) and has enough randomness and chance that it is not entirely predictable.  Nice to have the mini adventures that are engaging and also reduce downtime (everyone can listen in and be engaged), and are just the right length.  WP are usually games that I don't rank very high, but would play this one again, really nice.  In fact, I am itching to play it already :)

Superbly entertaining game. The story telling adds variety and instinctive, push your luck decisions to the village building gameplay. With multiple paths to victory, you're never really out of the running. Also, the lack of direct conflict makes it a great family game.

A great worker placement game. It has seen a lot of play with my girlfriend and I and we've never had a game that isn't enjoyable. However, we have banned the "new hires go into the active zone" key cards in an effort to balance the game, as we found if only one person got one of those cards, they would more often than not run away with the game.

Besides the dice, the luck of what villagers or buildings come out can have a big influence on the outcome.  The right item near the end of the game can easily make a 10 or more point swing and that's big when scores are typically 30-50.

Lo innovador del juego es la posibilidad de "escoger tu historia", sin embargo, se sienten inacabadas pues no tienen un desenlace claro. Las decisiones en ellas no tienen suficiente relevancia en el juego. De cualquier forma es un juego divertido aunque fuera de las historias no proponga nada nuevo.

On the fence about trading this away.  The storytelling is fun.  Not sure I will hold onto this one after all the stories are told.  When it's not your turn, there is little to keep you involved except hoping that another player does not take what you need (not fun) and listening to their story (fun).  Good for now, but probably not a ton of replay-ability.  This game is a bit long for what it is and occasionally overstays its welcome.

RATING: 7
This game is interesting in that it combines actually strategy mechanics with a choose your own adventure narrative mechanic.  The strategy mechanics make up most of the game - it feels like a worker placement but is actually more of a resource management. Only one action of many involves adventuring in the caves below. This is somewhat push your luck and has great stories that usually end with you getting some random resources.

A lighter game with some very interesting story elements that should appeal to a lot of new gamers. 

Pros:
-Wonderful and pleasing artwork
-Simple design but interesting choices
-Love watching my village grow both above and below
-Unique characters add an element of variety
-Multiple options when choosing your narrative decision

Cons:
-The stories are relatively generic and not interconnected
-Narratives are gimmicky and could lose appeal over many plays

FUN: the game looks amazing and you can almost imagine your village prosper.

UNIQUE: combining a sleek euro design with a storytelling game is a bold move.

NEGATIVES: the storytelling feels more like seperate events than an ongoing story. I understand that exploration needed to be balanced to not upset the euro-part of the design, but it means the stories and rewards are a little bland.

Ryan Lauket has a real penchant for beautiful designs. It isn't just his amazing artwork that makes them beautiful, they tend to be clever and elegant takes on well known systems. Above and below is an action selection style, engine building, euro, with  a choose your own adventure mechanic used for exploration. most of your available actions involve maintaining and utilizing your engine through building cards and recruiting new characters, which give you more actions per turn, however when you go exploring in the caves below your village you are treated to a story choice that, if made correctly, will grant resources, special character, and sometimes more story based on how you reacted. The whole thing comes together much better than it probably sounds, and I find it to be easy to get to the table even when playing with people who normally consider euro's to be a little dry for their taste.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The thing I want to say about Above and Below is that it's more fun than its mechanics. The mechanics are actually very solid, though the star buildings can make play a bit rote - integrating story with a euro in a fair way isn't easy, and they pulled it off, and the decision to place or wait on resources is wonderful.

The story is fine, though all the excerpts don't really fit together in a coherent whole.

But back to my main point, this game is more than the sum of its parts. Why? Joy. Something about how you grow your village, explore and have wacky adventures just brings joy to the table. It's the euro where people are actually smiling while they play.

RATING: 6.8
I have wanted to play this for a long time, and just recently managed to play a 2p game.

Though people say you don't need to explore to win, I felt I could do little else. Everything in the game costs money and money is scarse, especially in the beginning. I would constantly end up with 2 or more workers that could do nothing else in the round, so I sent them exploring. This did give me great advantage though, since, though I lacked the money to build anything on them, exploring gave me lots of space to build things and lots of goods, that I would immediately place on my score track to make a little more money next time.

I felt, however, that the game was playing me rather than me playing it, as the ramdomness of the encounters made any tactic kind of futile.

Overall the game is good, beautiful components and many strategies possible to try to amass some points. I might have built up my expectations since I wanted to play it for so long, and the game did not meet them.

I am still thinking of buying it though, just looking to see if maybe Near and Far makes a better attempt at it.

One of Lauketâs best, save for maybe this gameâs sequel, Near and Far.
Combines euro elements with some storytelling. That being said, donât expect a super immersive storytelling experience, as the âchoose your own adventureâ type mechanic of making a choice and then rolling for it does little more than put some flavor around your resource gathering roll. Itâs not akin to an rpg, in my opinion.
That said, the mechanics are solid, especially the incentive to acccumulate as many different types of resources as possible. 
As long as you donât lean too heavily on the narrative aspect, this is a great game. Looks great too.

Enjoyable combination of worker placement and paragraph adventure.  Not sure how well it blends though - the adventure text is quite random.

As with good worker placement game, there is not enough time to do everything and the end arrives very quickly.

Good:
Exploring underground locations results in adventures that are read from a journal. Your explorers get to chose how to handle what they find and then roll to see the results of their choices. This is our favorite part of this game.

Beautiful and diverse artwork. 

Great component quality. 

Bad:
There needs to be more story entries. We played this with 4 and by the 3rd game we end up with a majority of the exploration entries repeating. Once we knew the possible outcomes the game lost some of its appeal. 

There are some buildings which offer a pretty large advantage creating a runaway leader problem. In the games we played the people who would pick these up first would end up winning the game.  

So initially this was an entertaining title, and I wouldn't mind playing it on occasion, but without the draw of unique story entries this one no longer hits the table.

A fantastic civilisation building game with an interactive narrative element. The replayability is already high due to the large number of cards but couple this with the massive encounter book and it goes through the roof.

Beautiful game! A lightweight worker placement with a fun storytelling element. I love games where you build up your little city.

This will see a lot of table time because it plays fast and is easy to teach.

RATING: 5
I don't care for the artwork in this game and I'm noticing I'm having that issue in a lot of the newer games.  It seems like the artwork has declined over the years in boardgames.  Maybe it's just my personal preference.  

Also, the theme of the game to me is really lacking and the stories are lame.  There's no intrigue.  It kind of reminds of someone trying to interestingly describe a child playing a computer game and falling flat.  

There are also some mechanics that don't mesh with me either; i.e. injure your person to get an extra lantern, your automatically replenishable item doesn't replenish if it isn't harvested, a fixed 7 rounds of play no matter how many players, and only 1 additional starting coin for the 4th person in a 4 player game.  Overall, this game just doesn't do it for me and I have no inclination to play it again.

A charming, beautiful game that combines storytelling with Euro-style mechanics. Really a very pleasant game to play. The Euro mechanics are not particularly deep, but they add a sense of strategy.

RATING: 8.5
I absolutely love this game.  The worker placement, resource management, engine building mechanics of this game are good, but what really sets this game apart is the adventure/storytelling aspect.  I am really looking forward to getting the expansion book with my Near and Far Kickstarter to bring more life into this game. (while the story telling is what makes this awesome, it also hurts the replay-ability as you learn the stories)  
One other downside to this game is it is a little weird to bring this to an FLGS to play.  While it is fun for me to read stories to my family and close friends, it is awkward to read them to strangers.
So the story telling is what makes this game, but also what keeps it at 8.5 instead of higher.

A really nice and cute worker placement game with storytelling elements that makes it slightly different each time.

The core gameplay is fine although a bit repetitive with multiple games as it doesn't change too much.

The unique building powers are a bit dull as they are very samey.

The issues with the story is that there's no good resolution to them. You don't find out exactly what happened with your actions.

The roll of the dice on your adventures isn't my favorite part either, but it's okay.

This was more fun than I expected, given that I don't really care for storytelling games. I enjoyed all the mechanics outside of exploring, but exploring was really the heart of the game. Players commit some amount of resources and get what they get. It might be exactly what you need or irrelevant; it might be high-value or low-value; it might even just beat you down. Player choices are either obvious (higher requirements yield higher rewards) or irrelevant. Story lovers will enjoy what is here. I found it enjoyable but not something I would ever seek out again.

Very fun. This is exactly the balance between crunch and simplicity that I like. Wonderful graphic presentation. 

What would I change? A lot of the exploration paragraphs felt very samey. Maybe it was our luck of the draw, but many seemed like variations on "this old woman is lost and needs mushrooms." 

Would have liked to see more interesting consequences for negative moral decisions than just a hit on the reputation track. That said - I liked the paragraph integration so much that I'd love to see it used for more than just the underground exploratory stuff. So much potential there.

Overall, a beautiful, fun, medium complexity game that could appeal to a variety of gamers and semi-gamers.

There are elements of luck in all games, but this one presents an aspect of this which I find distasteful: some workers and locations are much better than others - this leads to games where it can be pretty obvious who's going to win... on turn 3.

While some massive strokes of luck/bad luck can change this, it still rankles a bit.

Some options also seem like "trap" options... So far as I can tell, there are 2 paths to follow in this game - and both are very reliant upon acquiring specific locations or workers.

I'd like to like it more - but there's too much about it that rubs me the wrong way.

The little stories save it from a lower score - those are excellent!

Not BOTH a strategy game AND a story-telling game, but HALF of each, if that makes sense.  The strategy seems pretty shallow (which isn't saying that the mechanics are bad- they work quite smoothly).  The stories are a very fun diversion, but aren't connected in any way, and you almost never get resolution from the encounters, so you just have to imagine an ending.

If you don't mind both elements being somewhat half-baked, and play just for the fun of it, you might find an enjoyable time.  I would still say I legitimately had fun. So, a great game for casual gamers, as long as they don't mind that it takes about the same time as a more in-depth strategy game (1-2 hours).

Oh, and gorgeous art, of course. :)

You can really get into the stories that appear during gameplay, even with the other players and make a bigger, connected story line.

I also enjoy the fact that most of the scenarios don't involve a total defeat (i.e you gain something even if you aim for the lowest result in the scenario). This allowed me to introduce it to friends who don't usually play board games with the result being a complete success and a well spent evening.

This isn't a very good design, but it is a fun game. It almost feels like two halves of two different designs. You have a Tales of the Arabian Nights-esque choose-your-own-adventure experience coupled with a pretty basic resource management Euro. The problem is, neither half feels completely finished. It literally feels like they smashed two half-finished designs together, and it shows. The game either needs to go on longer, or needs to be fleshed-out more. There's almost no time to enjoy what you've built before the game ends. I enjoy Above and Below, but it's not going to win any design awards.

Players are workers in a village constructing buildings and exploring the caves underneath. The novelty in this game, is that when one takes an explore action, you consult a manual, some flavor text is read, and the person taking the action has to make a decision on which choice to take. That person then rolls off for success. 

Other actions are recruit, build, and harvest. Another neat mechanism is that once used, your workers get tired, and they need rest through sleep, potions or cider, so you have to worry about that as well. 

There are a number of different goods in the game, and you score points at the end on the diversity of goods that you have. Your income is also greater with more diversity. 

The cards all help you supplement your strategy.  It's fun to play, especially to explore. But exploring has some limitations, since the reward is unknown until you commit your workers and is hard to plan around. But you need to successfully explore to be able to construct below builidings. I am looking forward to more plays. It's very innovative with the explore action and there are various ways to approach the game.

Played once with the family and liked it; will have to play a few more times to see if it will stick. Good introduction to worker/resource type games, although it's not really a worker-placement game per se since you aren't contending with each other for actions. The storytelling aspect adds a bit of thematic interest to the game that I think makes it more appealing to the family than an ordinary Euro would, and the artwork and component quality are great.

Maybe my gateway for the worker placement genre. The choices seem quite balanced, like taking labor just to get a single coin, but also getting cider if you are first to do so. The choices when exploring have a nice push and pull too. You never really feel like one choice or the other is the "correct" one and in many cases the rewards for a success feels varied. Plus, even though you may feel out of it, there's ways to wiggle your way back into competition.

Ryan knocks it out of the park with the art. I'm hoping to get the extra pieces from the Kickstarter to amp it up another notch. But the buildings all feel unique. You grow attached to certain villagers. That is near perfect.

My biggest irk is the lack of total choices to place workers. Coming from A Feast for Odin with its 60+ options, Above and Below feels restrained in comparison. It makes for easier choices, but easier isn't always better. Overall, gotta keep playing to see where it stands. Right now, it's really good, but not great.

fantastic first impression, that's mixed with foreboding for the second. As a fan of totan, this game doesn't quite reach the same heights of storytelling experience; deconstruct the mash-up quality and it's either a euro with a thematically-rendered luck element, or a shared activity experience that happens to have some textbook euro mechanics. And as with City of Iron, could there be something of a designer's trope in the aspect of resource hoarding? (v. the more standard euro mechanic of conversion)

Extremely clever reimagining of Tales of the Arabian Nights, where there's an honest-to-God GAME going on in service to the storytelling.  The art is nothing short of charming, the game is easily understood by anyone who's ever played a worker placement game, the tight 7 rounds keep everyone focus on growth and exploration... it's just a solid game, by a designer/artist with a growing reputation for solid games.

B-e-a-utiful looking worker placement story-telling game by Ryan Laukat. The best Laukat game that I've played, yet it feels there's something lacking here. But still I play this if suggested, but max three players. With four it can get painstakingly long especially if there's AP prone players.

Interesting enough Euro, fun story mechanics. Great job Ryan Laukat. In the 4 player game, we play it with one extra round.

Moved down to 7. Stories repeat, exploring is quite random and often punishing, a few strategies seem dominant. Still fun though.

What this game does really, really well is balance the line between downright fun and careful strategy. Sure, it won't be for everyone: the strategy elements are somewhat transparent, and the storytelling lacks any real decision. But the critical negotiation element of the game somehow bonds it all together and - perhaps more critically - gives it the right amount of familiarity and interaction to be worth playing again.

You could never take it too seriously, but as the definition of a game, Above & Below ticks all the boxes.

It looks amazing and has some interesting mechanisms.  However, some of the cards seem overpowered.  It's also an hour too long especially with 3 or more players.  Most disappointingly, the story telling aspect of the game leans towards generic fantasy encounters and does not really evoke a sense of place or tie in with the theme of rebuilding a settlement.  As a result I felt a bit disconnected from the game.  A shame as it could have been great.

I'm in love with this game. The artwork is fantastic, the stories are fun and immersive, the choice presented within them are sometimes lighthearted, sometimes not.
I like worker placement games where you compete about winning but without backstabbing or ways to destroy one another, like the Village, and this is one such game, but with the extra storytelling aspect.
Right now, this is the number one game for me, but that will probably change after I've played it more, but it will continue to be a strong, favorite game in my shelf.

I'd say that Above and Below is lighthearted enough for people new to the hobby, but still complex enough for more seasoned players to enjoy.

I could happily never play this again. While I enjoyed the storytelling aspects, the worker placement was bog standard and boring. There's a LOT of randomness in the exploration, which made it pretty difficult for me to implement any kind of strategy.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I enjoyed the combination of story telling combined with a solid, if relatively simple, Euro game. This blows Tales of the Arabian Nights out of the water for me since there is actually a game to play while also enjoying the story as it unfolds. I came close to ordering it when I first played and then, quite honestly, forgot about it. I think my family would enjoy this and I will probably take a flier on it at some point. I would definitely like to play again, especially with my kids. This would probably make a great family Christmas gift this year.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Beautiful artwork, I really like the different species of workers Ryan created.
- Quick game play, so even though the game is relatively simple it's enjoyable till the end.
- An amazing combination of game mechanics, worker placement and story telling, that works surprisingly well.
- The highlight of the game is going on the adventures, if you play with the right group you can really flesh out the stories as you play.

I had a blast playing this game. When you first start playing it is a pretty standard worker placement game with the biggest difference being that only certain workers can carry out some of the actions [i](hiring workers and building buildings). 

I'm only going to focus on what sets this game apart for the rest of this write up, which is the adventuring. You can decide to send 2 or more workers on an adventure in the caverns under the city. When you choose to go on an adventure you read a passage from a huge book and decide what you are going to do. You will always have some options, most of the time you can choose whether to be helpful/just or selfish/evil. On it's own this is a fun mechanic, but if you play with the right group (I did) it becomes even more fun. We were using different voices for the characters and embellishing some of the stories as we read them. As we played we kept embellishing the stories of our band of adventurers, of course this will completely depend on the group you play with. If the storytelling aspect doesn't appeal to you I think Above and Below will lose a lot of it's charm. For me this will probably be a game I get to play with my family. We love to role play the characters we play in almost any game, so introducing them to a story telling game will be quite fun.[/i]

RATING: 9.5
After playing it a few times and backing the spiritual sequel on Kickstarter, I was finally able to secure myself a copy! I have friends who all have different play styles, favorite games and pet peeves. We endlessly argue about whether or not Battlestar Galactica is worth playing and if Euros should ever exceed two hours in playtime, and if table-eating 4x games with miniatures are the Michael Bays of Gaming (all flash and no substance). But we all agree on one thing: Above and Below is a perfect game. It is a seamless intersection of theme and mechanics, the game design is flawless, and has tons of replayability. The problem with most story-heavy games (Ameritrash) is that, regardless of the world or universe, the objective remains the same: kill the monster, get the treasure, save the world, blah, blah, blah. Alternatively, the story means nothing as in the case of Tales of Arabian Nights, where a player's most obvious moral choice is the one that (by chance) complicates your path to victory...it is essentially Chutes and Ladders with telenovelas inserted before and after your turn. With Above and Below, all actions consist of one turn, with the adventure part usually being your last turn for the round. The rest of your time is spent buying buildings or harvesting your resources; all to make your journeys into the world below more profitable and less reliant on chance. The objective is still to gain the most victory points but even the social gamers will like the storytelling part; it's a bit like a campfire story. The turns are swift and everyone is excited to hear what happens to anyone venturing into the caves. Fantastic game and beautiful artwork, can't wait for the expansions and the team's new games.

I'm not a fan of the attempted merge of paragraph story with a Euro setting. Story driven theme needs a map and characters. Here you're a Euro-driver, but you can't get on with the game and implement the decisions you've planned - ie the essence of good Euro-ness - as you get held up waiting while other players stop, roll dice, read an out-of-place, out-of-context paragraph with zero relevance to their tableau and the resource/VP engine they're creating, and watch while they then roll (and re-roll) more dice to resolve one of the options it presents. Take that out and the game's mechanics seem decent and attractive enough to warrant replay, but it's more downtime than I'm willing to bear, especially as that seems to be a strong path to victory and thus frequently taken.

I must say that this is the most charismatic Euro I've ever played. Yup, this is a worker-placement Euro with storytelling elements. The Euro-mechanisms holistically are on the same level as Stone Age, but the feel of the gameplay transcends it to a different category.

I think that this could be considered a gateway game, and a meaty family game.

It's fiddly and it seems silly that you could win without engaging in the game's central hook of exploring, but it is as successful as I can imagine a game that combines encounter-based imaginative play (a la Arkham Horror) with Euro mechanics (resource management, sort-of engine building). The seams show, but I want to keep playing!

Not a horribe game, but not a very good one, either.  If you remove the story book, the card building and worker placement mechanisms are decent yet very ordinary.  I thought many of the resources, like mushrooms and crystals, to be rather silly since you really did not do anything substantial with them.  The main attraction and hype of the game is the little story blurbs you encounter when you explore.  I found these to be disjointed from each other as well as completely disconnected from the game.  You assign workers to hopefully gather enough lanterns through dice rolls to complete a choice A or a choice B.  Choice B is riskier but often has a better reward.  Much  of the time you will succeed and the outcome is along the lines of "take a coin" or "take a resource" and the the story blurb is just left hanging.  When we played, it seemed the players lost interest in the stories and just wanted to hear how many lanterns were needed for A or B.  I cannot recall a single story from the game.  A definite pass from here on out.

Above and Below is an attempt to combine the paragraph-based story-telling of Tales of the Arabian Nights with a worker-placement resource-collection eurogame. It mostly succeeds at that, though dice-based skill checks will deter the luck-averse. The eurogame portion of the game uses a pleasant open draft system to acquire new workers and places to use them, and avoids the "more workers = better" problem by not having them all activate automatically each turn. The resource mechanism was actually pretty clever, as you want to put different kind of goods in your display quickly to gain income, but also put goods that you end up with a lot of into your display later to be worth more end-game points. I enjoyed this game, and my main complaint is that I wish there was more of it--I felt like I would've gotten more out of the game if I had more time to develop my engine.

I have very mixed feelings about the game. The worker placement aspect of the game works very well (although I would've liked to be able to injure my workers any time for an extra action), but the reward, the buildings, are quite boring. I don't feel like I'm building a cool village. The buildings don't help me evolve (except for the beds), they just earn points in various ways. That, and the amount of down-time, made the game very boring to me.
The exploring part of the game is again on the one hand very well done: the randomness in accomplishing a quest is reduced by having the options of picking a harder or easier option and the option to injure your workers. But the rewards are completely random, some are way better than others, but you could also end up getting things you don't even need.
So, I like the mechanics and the idea behind the game, but the results are just not satisfying, robbing the game of potential enjoyment.

interesting project. Kinda worker placement building and quest game - the quests are chosen by dice and are included in a big book (each quest having a different number). Easy to learn easy to play and quite funny moments when reading the quests (if you play with the appropriate company you can have really fun on that). Winning the quest is decided mainly by dice too. Overall I think a 7 is fair. Im not crazy about the game but I can play it again for a few times without complaining.

Have ultimately played this close to 10 times, still not tired of it. I feel that it has enough variation to make it fun each time, especially since you'll roll well one game and not the next. Went from 70+ points in one game to ~40+ in the next. It's fun to take the risk of exploring to see what you get.

This is a very engaging game; the story paragraphs you uncover while exploring make each game very rich in theme.  The randomness adds to the enjoyment and doesn't detract from decisions you will make. (The only real randomness is in exploring.)  Training new villagers makes for an interesting economic engine and building houses and outposts adds to this. Some are going to quarrel that you can't interact with your neighbor enough (essentially it is through placing items for sale and buying something before another and removing that option from them).

Unadventurous adventure game. I liked everything about the game except for the complete lack of danger. You explore a cave and have an adventure and the worst case scenario is you return empty-handed. 
To waste most of a turn in a game that has only 7 rounds is serious for your chances to win, but I wish the designer had put a little more terror in the game. I don't enjoy dying or having a limb chopped off, but the thought that this might actually happen does add spice. As it is, this game is too bland.

This is a really tight worker placement game where you don't have time to achieve what you want to do. In the game you are trying to make time to hire new workers, buy buildings, gather different goods and go adventuring. The adventuring mechanism is a big luck element. You send 2+ workers, draw a card, roll and die, and then another player finds the matching result number and reads the story snippet in the storybook along with two reactions the player can react with along with the difficulty rating of choosing that reaction. It's unusual, but possible to completely fail, as each worker sent rolls a d6 to see they contribute successes. Rewards can range from a few bucks, to valuable resources, to special characters. The unevenness in the value of the rewards can give certain players opportunity advantages over others.

The obvious comparison for this game would be Tales of the Arabian Nights, which also uses a choose your own adventure style book, however the two games have very different feelings. In Arabian Nights, you have a character, and when you are presented with a story choice, you think, what would my character do in this situation? In Above and Below, you are mostly looking at the numbers. If one decision requires 4+ successes, and the other has a different result that would succeed with 3+ or 7+, what I'm doing is looking at how many successes I think I can roll based on the workers I sent on the adventure. Not as much at the story choice. This isn't a problem with the game per se, but initially I was thinking that this game would solve the problem of Arabian Nights, where it's mostly story and not much game.

Nobody in my group felt particularly passionate about this game, but I'm excited to see where this style of game goes from here.

This game is pretty good. I liked the idea of going on quests and having to decide between the easy or hard choice but not knowing the reward beforehand. A few different paths to victory but some variables for each that keep it interesting depending on some end game scoring. Obviously the art is awesome and helps enhance the theme. I liked the tough decisions that come from the time sensitive choices you need to make. Not sure if I'll keep this one forever but it definitely has a few more plays for sure.

I genuinely like what Ryan Laukat is trying to do with this game, but it doesn't quite shine.   
I'm interested to see what gets iterated on in Near and Far.

Above & Below is split into two charming, but distinct halves: a euro style engine building section, and a completely random adventure segment that requires you to roll dice to progress.     
The euro-engine building is just OK.   There's a market with stuff you sort of want, and workers you can send to do the things you need.  Nothing new, but it flows well. 
However anything you could spend resources on here pales in comparison with the potential loot you could be getting from the adventure segment... but adventure loot is totally unforeseeable and random, so you can't actually plan around or for it.

But thats not why anyone bought this game.  We're all here for the story telling, which unfortunately falls a bit flat.   
Take the adventure action, roll a die, cross reference book to get a bland story snippet and roll to see if you qualify for the skill check.   There's not even a story resolution!  You could be fighting with a goblin for your life, fail the check, and....... well, nothing.   That's it.

Put these two halves together, and you have an engine builder that's swiftly rendered  irrelevant by potential random encounter successes, and story segments with no payoff or predictable engine building relevance.

Love the art, and components. Play is calming yet very tactical. Storytelling aspect for underground buildings is fun, but drags sometimes when multiple attempts fail. New "groves" expansion should help with, if not solve, this minor issue many seen to express with the game.

Early reports that A&B was a euro storytelling game blend were a bit off. There is a lot of wonderful theme to this game. The stories are quirky and fun and give plenty of nods to iconic pop-culture fantasy. That being said, the actions you take outside of exploring are a bit clunky and uninspired. Workers generally do the same thing, and the only thing important about the resources is collecting ones you don't already have, thus, most of the strategy comes from being first to take a specific action each round so you can grab a token or spend less money.

Overall, this does not feel like a euro game. Exploring is nearly essential to a winning strategy, and it boils down to mostly luck. Still, there is plenty to of fun to be had here. Above and Below rests comfortably between Agents of Smersh and Tales of Arabian Nights, and will get played about as often. Just don't take it too seriously.

Heres the bulletpoint review :

- great theme going on here.  I like how it introduces us to a fantasy world that I'd like to know more about.  The glogos, all these folks living underground, the backstory of your villiage being burned.... Seems like there is a really cool mythology here I'd like to see fleshed out.  It lets your imagination run wild and that's fun!

- the stories are fun to read.  See above, lots of "unexplained" happenings that make you wonder what's going on in this world.

- a nice village building/worker placement game under all the story.  I'm still figuring out what types of strategies I want to employ (Other than exploring all the time :P ).

- the art is very different....in a good way!  A very unique style that is unlike other things I've seem previously.  Again, this helps with the "giving the world it's own feel".  Sure it may be fantasy setting, but it's not the typical one, and the art conveys this.

- I want more stories!  I would love to get an expansion that adds more tales to the mix, and one that gives both failure and success texts to really help others "feel" the world.  I try to come up with victory or failure summaries on the fly, but for others this is a tough task (I have years of experience as a DM, my wife doesn't).

- I don't like Kickstarter exclusives :(.  I understand the why I suppose, but I didn't even know about this game until it was too late.  I would love it if the extras were put up for sale sometime.

For me, this game is just a matter of going through the motions and enjoying the company of the people you are playing with.  The story element is enjoyable, but ultimately just a luck-fest.

I'd always be willing to play this game if the group wants to, but I'd never ask to play it.  I prefer heavy strategy so this game just isn't designed for people like me.

This game is a unique mix of euro gaming and storytelling.   Ironically I think it works as an entertaining game that CAN be taken seriously.   The storytelling results seem balanced and make sense.  Plays quick as a two player game but adds significant time with more players.  I'd guess three is fine but four may run a little long.  This game involves strategy and a loose outline of a plan is helpful to get you village engine running.  Time will tell if the reply value is here with the limited book but it seems like there is a lot here to explore.  Overall, a very unique mix of mechanics that is fun even if you lose and also has a really nice look to it.  Great artwork too!

RATING: 7.1
This is a game the wife picked and backed on KS.
Hearing reviews describe this as a bit like Arabian Nights, put me off this a little bit, as i tend to find that game too random for its game play length.  First game in though and it's more worker placement with a pinch of storytelling when exploring.
In what is becoming typical Ryan Laukat game, it has a unique style and feel. 
This is the second of his games i've played, the first being Ancient World and as a designer, publisher,artist etc he is certainly raising the bar.
Keep up the good work !

Having got a number of plays in of this game, you may remember a story recurring but not necessarily the rewards taken.

Rated '9' after one play. You get the right people playing, hamming up or acting out the story, it becomes so easy to get immersed. 

One of Ryan Laukat's finest, most ambitious work. The art on this is absolutely stunning. One of the most beautiful games I own. 

Is this game fun? Unequivocally. Is it replayable? Oh my goodness yes. I'm already looking forward to playing it again.

I'm mostly disappointed with this one. Surely, the appeal is the storytelling, right? wrong, exploring is too costly and the returns, if any without sending your workers to the infirmery, do not fit on average your overall strategy.

... the net result is that it makes little sense to explore, barring the occassional foray into the caves to break the monotony of what is otherwise a fairly standard resource management game, and ultimately leaving out almost entirely the storytelling element.

I guess there is some neat idea in this mashup of genres, but the execution is half-baked. Shame, proper development would likely have made this a decent game, but as is it's another casualty of the Kickstarter trend to bypass the crucial step of maturation, jumping straight into production. The fact that the later is outstanding in this instance is a pretty small consolation...

The paragraphs seemed too sparse. Their resolution was lacking and consistently broke any sense of adventure. The game does not feel fully realized or polished. 

Additionally, the game this game is ultimately slain by the Kickstarter exclusives. While there are an inherently limited number of paragraphs, the retail version is inferior and incomplete since it is missing a whole chunk of story paragraphs.

I will not support a company/designer that practices this way.

This title, along with a handful of others, contributed to my gateway experience with hobby board games. I recall being absolutely enchanted with it, and perhaps I still may find it enjoyable to play today. I simply do not feel as compelled to do so as I once was, as my tastes in gaming have quickly deviated into heavy, strategic board games. There is something to be said about simplicity and innovation, and Above and Below is commendable in that regard.

(+) Quite a novel story-telling element.
(+) The engine building and resource management is fairly straightforward to understand.
(+) Vibrant aesthetics pleasing to the eye.

(-) Seems to end too abruptly.
(-) Storytelling loses its novelty over time.
(-) Lacking in player interaction.

A little too random for how long it is.  The encounters are not stupid like in many narrative games, but there is still luck that is completely outside your control.  The building draft board tends to force you down a particular strategy, not let you choose one -- the strategies seems to be balanced, but you have mostly only an illusion of control.  So, much of the game is pleasing in pieces, but all put together it's not quite satisfying.

Whimsical fun when played with literary friends who enjoy choose your adventures, the reputation aspect adds interesting player/character alignment ethical choice decisions. There is plenty of strategic thinking to keep all players involved as the game develops. In response to "too few turns in the game" criticism I have read from opinionated gamers, I think the fewer turns adds to the gravity of risk/benefit decision making; exciting do or die moments. Go big or go home, or languish safely...in last or second to last place. Fun to win and only 90 minutes , one is never really out of the game with a good balance of both deliberate caution and risk taking. This game is a keeper!

A charming design that is not quite to my taste but I enjoy playing on occasion. This is one of the games that we use to introduce non-boardgames to the hobby. I would enjoy this game more if 1) the Euro-game aspect had more depth; 2) the adventure aspect were more coherent and actually had a meaningful story arc. As it is, the Euro-game is lite with few decisions, and the adventures are just random entertainment.

RATING: 10
The Encounter Book is a 10 - it's some of the best writing I've seen in a board game (not as good as an RPG, but better than Mice and Mystics, etc.), with interesting options - only wish there were more times when the characters exploring or tiles you have is relevant for helping you succeed.  But I can only give it a 9, because there are some issues with the gameplay - I feel like the rest of game other than exploring wasn't fully fleshed out.  Training is not that interesting - the characters don't have much variation.  Harvesting is way too slow and how you place them on the lower track is not interesting - it's just too hard to get a surplus of tiles to make buying/selling/trading between players to be very relevant. This game really begs to take the Encounter Book and design a better game around, one focused on exploring and trading tiles between players to get the right set collection (more points for more different types, bonus points from buildings or even secret starting goals for having certain combinations of tiles, etc.)  That said, I'm still happy to play this game as is, to get a chance to experience more of the Encounter Book.

Update:  Ok, it's a 10. I didn't even play it, but just taught and GM'd the game, reading all the story elements and it was some of the most fun I've had "playing" a game.  When I taught it, I included a house rule that you could have unlimited items up for sale, rather than being limited to one (minimum cost was still $3 per tile) and you could also trade tiles (like a mushroom for an amethyst) and supplement that trade with $1 or more.  I also encouraged players to send 3 or even 4 villagers on their encounters to aim for possible higher rewards (only 1 encounter completely failed).  These 2 things meant that there was a lot more resources and money flowing and the game was a lot more enjoyable for all.  I have played it myself more times and continue to focus on exploring for pure enjoyment (often sending 3 or even 4, and then bummed when it's not a challenging high reward story), and while I find tile trading easier with my house rule, it is still difficult often due to limited money.

Received in trade from bjorndog.

An interesting game that, much like the similar "Tales of the Arabian Nights," almost tries to trick the players into role-playing by presenting them with scenarios and letting them choose which option to pursue. In this case, it's usually in the form of "Option A, which has a target number of X, or Option B, which has target numbers of Y or Z." The player is informed of what X, Y and Z are so they know their chances of actually succeeding.

Now that I've played it once, there are other games that I've received recently that I'd rather get back to the table than this. But I wouldn't object to playing it again, and I think with the right group it could be a fantastic experience.

Ein solides Einstiegerspiel um Wenigspieler und/oder Kinder in die Welt der Worker-Placement-Spiele einzufÃ¼hren.
Gerade mit Kindern bis ca. 12 Jahre aufgrund des Designs und der Abenteuer, die man "unten" erleben kann geeignet.
Allerdings hÃ¤tte man meines Erachtens diese Abenteuer Ã¼berraschender gestalten kÃ¶nnen. 
Man wird "unten" vor Entscheidungen gestellt, mit wieviel Risiko man das Abenteuer eingeht.
Man kann allerdings vor der Entscheidung sehr gut abschÃ¤tzen, was einem als Belohnung winken wird. AuÃerdem weiÃ man schnell, wieviel Erfolge man erreichen muss um ein Abenteuer gesichert solide zu bestehen oder sogar gut zu bestehen.
Zwar hÃ¤ngen die Erfolge auch vom WÃ¼rfelglÃ¼ck ab, jedoch bleibt es doch zu gut planbar.
Die einzige "Ãberraschung" bleibt somit vor Antritt des Abenteuers mit welcher/welchen Ressource(n) man belohnt wird.
Hier hÃ¤tte ich mir mehr Ã¼berraschende Wendungen je nach Entscheidung gewÃ¼nscht. 

Meines Erachtens als Spiel mit Kindern bis ca. 12 Jahre durchaus zu empfehlen.

I found this game to be fun and engaging; the mechanics didn't blow me away, but were simple systems which worked well, making me wonder why I hadn't seen them elsewhere.  On the negative side, the little story paragraphs are not particularly well-written, and I dislike the lack of control over what sort of event you will have when you choose to adventure.  If it were possible to choose between different areas for adventure, with each area corresponding to a set of possible rewards (with the likelihoods known by the players), I think this would be really great.

The worker placement and decisions on whether to explore, recruit more workers, build, or accrue more goods and harvest, are hard to make as you only have seven short rounds to try to make a strategy work.

This is a euro + a very watered down sampling of Tales of the Arabian Nights, and it falls flat IMO. The story part of the game ends up with you making decisions based almost entirely on the numeric difficulty of the ensuing challenge, which is the only hard information you are given. It's a shame, because it would be more fun to make choices based on the actual stories, but the way it connects back to the euro (quantitatively rather than qualitatively) pushes you away from that mode of choosing.

Above and Below is quite an enjoyable game without a huge learning curve and fortunately not too long to set up the myriad of components. We love the quirky art and especially the unique choose your own adventure explore mechanism, but the game always seems to end just once your villlage is getting started. I can never seem to amass as many resources as I want or acquire as many underground homes or recruit all the people I want. I guess that's a hallmark for a very good game then, always leaves you wanting to play more. This game is much more fun with 4 players than with 2. I am certain this will make it to the table top quite a few more times until we run out of exploration stories. One potential downside for replayability is it doesn't appear as if any more expansions are planned to extend the story telling function in the game. Once you start repeating those explorations interest level will inevitably wane. That's an easy fix though to issue a new exploration book even if by fan expansion alone.

It always feels just a round or two "too short", but we like the puzzling of how best to use our villagers to do things in that limited amount of time, and the exploring storytelling is fun.  I wish more of the stories had "failure" text to read, but that's a minor quibble.

This was an interesting experience - the artwork didn't make it feel like an RPG, but the encounter book did.  Our group really got into the encounters and had fun with them.  We botched a scoring rule at the beginning (but got it right at the end), so we discovered our strategies may change the next time.

This has become a fast favorite at my household, second only to 'Clank!' in excitement to play. My 12 and 13-year-old sisters love playing this. The gameplay is solid. You're focused on your own town, but there's still a large degree of interaction. Trades are important, and the 3+ image sets a nice baseline (of course, other exchanges and trades take place as needed, but the general rule keeps the general consensus of any one item around 3 gold.) There's up to five market rows at once (Above Houses, Below Houses, Villagers, Key Houses (not replaced), and Star Houses (not replaced)) so there's always something to work for and also worry about someone else grabbing.

The real action that separates Above and Below from other games is the encounter exploration book. It is the game's biggest strength and simultaneously largest weakness. The strength lies in its ability to make each game unique for each person. There's value in assigning more workers to the trip, but using that many "turns" at once for what may be a sub-par encounter is always risky. But it's still basically required, and reading can be as enjoyable as playing, so there's a large degree of group participation that people can really get into. (Even though it's not really interaction, but the resources gained from the journey might go up for trade soon after). But it's also the reason it doesn't get played as much as it could. There's over 200 numbered random encounters, but 50 or so of those are just second parts of other encounter numbers. You'll start seeing repeat descriptions after a few plays. That doesn't necessarily change your action (it's still mostly based on reputation and the probable amount of skill you can get out of the people you sent) but it does dampen the immersion the game strives for. So it doesn't get played as often just to try to keep the encounters from becoming too familiar. It's okay to recognise the encounter in general, but remembering the results does reduce the fun for some. 

More encounters and villagers are only available in completed Kickstarter packages (including another encounter book!!!), so good luck trying to track those down. Non-cosmetic kickstarter exclusives (that are more than just a single piece or card or such) always leave a bad taste in my option.

Still, even without those exclusives it's a solid game. There's many paths to success, and I've seen people win in multiple ways. The star cards offered each time allow flexibility for making the most of the cards and encounters you get. I absolutely recommend getting it, especially if you have a group that can really get into telling a story.

The option to go on a cavern expedition makes this game really fun.  The unknown of the risk/reward possibility can keep parties engaged.   Because of the option to sell resources, this game works best with 3 or 4.  But with just 2 peeps, this can be a 60-min game.

We've only played once so far, but we loved it! If you are a fan of Tales of the Arabian Nights, this game might be for you. You have a bit more control over what happens to you in the game and the storybook elements only happen when you explore, but they are really fun. The game is simple to explain, and because there are only seven rounds, there is a nice amount of strategy to it. It's a bit of a table hog however. :D

I love the ideas in this game: two things that stand out are the storytelling aspect as well as set collection element. The storytelling aspect really adds some great theme and provides for some interesting decisions and gives you the feel that you're actually exploring a bunch of caverns around your village. The set collection element is innovative - you add goods to a scoring track, and the main element is that the more different goods you place there, the more income you collect, but if you can wait before placing a certain type of good, they can be worth more points. 

What really reduces the rating for me is that the game felt kinda slow, and I don't think it offers a bunch of decisions for the time it takes to play. You have such limited resources and each move seems to be quite impactful to the ending score that you really have to spend a bunch of time figuring out what to do next. Definitely a title where fewer is better, as it lessens the downtime, and I can see it really shining as a two-player game (I played it with 3).

Beautifully produced worker placement game that plays like countless others, except this one tacks on a choose-your-own-adventure storytelling component.  While there are hundreds of "adventures" in the game's story book, they all seem to be variations on the same two or three themes; they're largely decision-free, and rewards for success are random and arbitrary.  At heart, this is another very shallow euro with nice artwork.

RATING: 8
This is a pseudo worker placement/story-telling game.  I always use the qualifier "pseudo" for worker placement where action spaces are never blocked off by other players' workers.  To me this is more just action selection with the number of actions you have determined by your worker count.

Each round of this game players will take turns taking actions until all of their available workers have been used or they decide to pass their turn early.  You can hire more workers, build buildings that provide a wealth of additional benefits, harvest resources, collect money, or the big action, explore.  Exploring is where the story-telling element comes in.  When you explore you read a passage from a book and it gives you 2 or more options.  Then you roll dice and based on the workers you chose for that explore action you get a number of successes which determine the rewards (or punishments) you receive for your choice and success rate.

I found myself not necessarily optimally choosing options from the book that best suited the workers I chose but more-so trying to roll play what i would actually choose.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing and actually caused me to get more enjoyment out of the game.  It could certainly end in sub-optimal gameplay though, I ended up winning and I don't think I would have particularly cared if I lost because of this but others might.

The story-telling was the best part of the game in my opinion.  In fact, the worker placement portion was reasonably bland.  There was no real worker placement, that is blocking other players, so strategy and player interaction was kind of left by the wayside unless you happened to hire a worker or build a building before another player targeting it could.  But I enjoyed hearing the stories, role playing my own decisions, and accepting what may come.  This leads to one of my biggest criticisms, the story book seemed a bit light considering that's the selling point of this game.  There are, I believe, 25 story cards with 6 possibilities on each one.  That's 150 stories.  We went between 20-30 of them in one play.  So In just a couple games you could start reading the same story which not only just hurts the experience but could also hurt the gameplay if you remember what options you took last time and used that to color your options the next time around.

I gave this the same rating as Tales of Arabian Nights.  That is fair and unfair.  This is a better game. Actually there is a game here unlike TOAN but they both fill the same niche.  That snowy winter day when you want to kill some time with family.  With TOAN we just laugh our heads off because we get zany and each play is memorable for what happens to us in it.  With A&B there is an enjoyable worker placement game.  You're not going to have the memorable game plays (character disasters) like with TOAN, but there's real decisions to be made with A&B and it's engaging and enjoyable.  There's room for both in my collection, and it depends what mood you are in on that snowy winter day.  Both my young adult children really liked this game.

I loved this game, specifically the exploring/story telling aspect of it. This game reminded me of the choose your own adventure books I used to read as a child. I enjoyed the exploring aspect so much that I started to care less and less about getting victory points and more about exploring as the game progressed. My game group had a fabulous time reading them!  Also, the art is beautiful!

I would have rated this higher, but as I mentioned earlier, I felt like at the end I cared more reading the stories then actually playing the game.

Variant: Have a house rule that the story reader comes up with an explanation as to why you got that reward.
Variant 2: One way to guarantee that there will be no repeats over a six game stretch: Instead of rolling for a story when you do an adventure, just assign a number to the game: 1 for first game, 2 for second, etc.
Variant 3: If beds are not available, consider refreshing buildings once for free. (See Thread)

The randomness of the dice rolls for lanterns plus the randomness of the rewards from the book makes this game feel like luck played a big part in who won. Especially since exploring is so expensive. 

Stunning artwork and great theme though. Mechanics are clearly well thought out and game is overall tight and well designed. Reading scenarios from the book really make it feel like you're exploring and is a cute, fun gimmick.

Short enough where the randomness issues don't tick you off too much.

Seems like a good gateway game for the worker placement genre. I would call it "worker assignment", as you do assign workers to different tasks, and then they become unavailable for other tasks, just like in a worker placement game. But there are no slots that you can occupy in order to block other players from taking an action.

You can of course be the first to grab a particular worker or building, thus stopping your opponent from getting that particular worker or building. But you can't outright block them from the action.

This makes for a much gentler introduction to the genre than a game where a beginner could potentially not just fail to build an effective engine, but even fail to build anything at allâ¦

It's also a good midpoint between fillers and the really heavy games I already have.

This is one of the best games I have ever played! 
The gameplay is magnificens, pretty easy to learn and very intrieging. The art is superb!
And then comes the storytelling! When we were playing and reading to each other I litterarly got goosebumps on my skin because you can really get into character and be a part of the story. 
There is only one problem with this game - it end way to quickly! :) I wish it would  be twice as long because it was just that much fun and you want to keep exploring!

Light resource management game coupled with paragraph-driven adventuring a la Tales of the Arabian Nights. Workers can be put to use building, harvesting goods, recruiting more workers etc., or sent exploring into the caverns below the town. Successfully resolving an encounter paragraph there gives a cave space for underground building and some reward or other (a combination of resources, money and gain/loss of reputation).

I'm not interested in light resource management games but this would be a great one for families. While the random elements are significant, they're no worse than most family-weight games and the paragraphs do a much better job at bringing the theme alive than is typical for games with event cards etc.

Good game, not for me but good game.

Like others, I wish the stories had resolutions.  And like others, it feels like the economic game is important in the path to victory but much less interesting than adventuring.  And like most of those reviews, I also somehow felt that the game comes together into something more than the sum of its parts.  Not a big recommendation from me, but I like it.  Great art too.

The story part of this game is a lot of fun. It reminds me of Arabian Nights, but better. I feel like the game is simultaneously too long and too short. I wish there were a few less decisions to make and more time for exploring and building. I also wish that we could start with more people so we could have better opportunities for exploring from the beginning. I feel like I just get a decent-sized village together to do some great exploring, and oops, the game is over.

A nicely designed game with terrific artwork. Putting the adventure book in a ringed binder was a good idea (it will get handled a lot).

I was wary of the RPG element, but it actually blends quite nicely into the flow of the game. While this is a strength, the complete randomness of the encounters can be a bit frustrating.

Still, the designer's best effort to date IMHO.

Best new game I've played in a long time.  It is obvious that the creator did a lot of play testing with this.  

It is a basic worker placement style game with the workers having varying abilities but what makes this game different is the exploration. You run into a random scenario with interesting (and sometimes humorous) flavor text for a choice you have to make, and then succeed at. Some clue as to what the reward is as well as whether it is a good or bad choice exist hidden in the flavor but not all outcomes are predictable. 

The artwork is spot on as well.  

This game is interesting and tantalizes the imagination.

Great for all ages, with the family, or the strategy geeks.

Based on the session report, it seems as if it is multiplayer solitaire. Action point allowance to get some economy rolling, and a shallow Tales of the Arabian Night adventure thingy to get more options for more resources. 

I see no interaction at all. Yes, you can trade with your friends, wheehee. Also, someone else reads the storybook. Well, I consider Tales not a game but a pastime. Mix pastime with Euro, strip out the competitive element... seems not my cup of tea.

My information is admittedly limited on this one, and Laukat has demonstrated to create excellent games, so I might be completely off the bat here. However, see no need to investigate further at the moment.

tl;dr: enjoyable and approachable

This is sort of a worker placement game. You have a number of workers (with different skills) and actions. You decide which workers to assign to which action. The main action is to go on adventures, but there's also resource and worker recruitment elements that can't be ignored. The adventures have you roll a die to determine a random encounter from a big flip book, sort of like in [thing=34119][/thing]. The biggest difference is that in that game is that the paragraphs depend on your character and current situation, so there is sort of a thread that sort of makes sense. In Above and Below the paragraphs are just random, only based on a card and a roll, so there is no line that moves from one to an other. So in that regard [thing=34119][/thing] does a better job. But this game is a better game as it is way more controllable. There is an actual game. I see [thing=34119][/thing] more as an activity as there is so little control. So don't get these two games confused. They are very different but they share one common idea.
In the end I quite like this game. It's approachable and challenging and doesn't outstay it's welcome.

Worker placement goodness with interesting twist with storytelling
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The game itself is good but not great. My main criticism is simply that the game seems to end the very moment your engine of workers is established. I would probably like the game better if it were to go one more round than it does. Or, I might try starting with all your initial workers awake in the first round even for 3 and 4-player games and see if that helps to get the engine going just a bit earlier so you can at least get a bit of experience in applying it.

What really makes this game is the storytelling. It is just so fun to go on adventures and experience the stories. I do think the stories could be improved by adding a bit more storytelling to the actual resolution of the choices you make --partly as a way of justifying (or just creating a more vivid mental picture of) why you got the rewards or penalty that you did. Honestly, I often times just go adventuring as much as I can even though I now it isn't the best strategy simply because it is the part of the game that is most fun.

Update: Sold this game to purchase Near & Far. Based on reviews so far, Near & Far seems to integrate the story more seamlessly to the game play.

3/29/2017: This is the 2nd time I played the game, and this time it was played with 2 players. I definitely enjoy the game more with more higher player count. With two players, the buildings are not recycled as fast as I want them to be. Many times, I will stuck with the same options one round to the next. The positive with playing with 2 players is shorter play time. We were able to get it done within 60 minutes. 

As for the game, I really like the story telling element of the game, and also the graphic design. It's definitely one that I enjoy playing and would not turn down one when asked by someone.

I admire Ryan Laukat a lot.  His games are all beautiful with interesting themes, and he does everything himself.  Yet, none of his games have quite passed the cut with me to stay in my collection, and I'm worried Above and Below missed the cut again even though it's a very unique game.

The game is more or less worker placement where you get money, harvest goods, and buy buildings and workers.  There is a pretty good euro base to this game, and it has a very cool income/scoring mechanic for the goods.  Basically, each time you get a new type of good you can lock it into your board.  By locking in the good, you get more income.  However, once you lock a good, that determines how many points each of those goods is worth.  The more goods you have locked, the more points each new good is worth.  So you want to lock in one of each of the rarer goods early, then collect a bunch of common goods that are worth a lot of points.  It's hard to explain, but very cool.

Then there is the exploring.  You send out explorers and read one of the 200+ adventures.  The stories are pretty good and they usually give you two choices that often fall along the lines of "do you do the evil thing that probably has more rewards, or do the good thing that probably has more reputation."  But they also tell you how hard each adventure is, so even if you are inclined to do one option over the other, you often end up just choosing the hardest option that you can actually accomplish.  Once you've made your choice you roll some dice to see if you succeed.  If so, you get a reward.  If not, you've wasted your action.

I have 3 complaints about the adventures:
1) The choices are limited, and often dictated by the target number instead of the flavor of the choices.
2) The rewards are highly variable and unpredictable, and can drastically affect your game performance (mostly, whether or not you get a good that you don't already have).
3) While the stories are nice, most stories have no resolution paragraph.  They just say you get X coins, or a mushroom, or whatever.  It would be nice if they told you why.

So I'm not sure where this leaves the game.  It's a hybrid with a euro core and these adventures on top.  There is too much euro/strategy for people that want a story game.  Yet the adventures create too much randomness for a euro gamer.  I fear that by trying to combine both design ideas, it's going to end up creating a target audience that is too narrow.

But, my wife likes it so far, and that's the most important test.  We'll see how this looks a year from now.  In the meantime, Above and Below made me try out Tales of Arabian Nights, which I'll talk about below.

A very nice fusion of worker placement and storytelling, which could appeal to those, who feel bored playing most euro-games. Storytelling brings an atmosphere of adventure to this game and some randomness as a result of the exploring action (you may even lose the reputation or have other negative consequences). It is easy to draw players into the game, but surprisingly challenging to win for such simple rules.

Played with the expansion at a board game meetup. The adventure stories, the main driving force of the game, are more quantity than quality, with few descriptive results of what occurs after an action. The adventure stories also tend to ignore your progress, only looking as deep as your Explore count (ex: An old woman wants fish, you have them in your inventory but giving her one is not an option. You must search for them or ignore her). The "mean" options are also not balanced, not only because they give (sometimes permanent) downsides but because those downsides are not offset with better rewards. 

The rest of the game is very standard worker placement without any player interaction beyond moving the market rows (there is also no player interaction in the adventuring portion). The worst part of the game, besides waiting for other players non-interactive turns to end, is that you have to play the worker placement to interact more with the story. The stories, however their quality, are much more exciting than this part due to their fun introductory blurbs and random nature. Even then, adventuring is less beneficial than buying workers/making buildings/gathering. Only one small part of the game directly benefits from adventuring (underground buildings). In addition there are several end game buildings that promote having multiple of the same resource, which is counter to the random rewards from adventuring.

The writing and gameplay are both mediocre. The worker placement leaves you wanting for fun choices and adventuring leaves you wanting for meaningful choices. Neither want is satisfied.

RATING: 5
(TActically high) Above and (strategically way down) Below! This game has so many elements that just can't be planned ahead, which makes your choice of what to do a choice of the odds and not a choice of the mind. Also, let's face it, there is no such thing as an epic, immersive world that's to be told in seven rounds of gameplay. It's not happening. When reading from the book of encounters to me all I remembered was for instance, it's either x succeses or y/y+2 succeses needed. Decide now! It doesn't help that your encounters are just a bunch of random events independent from each other. "Hey guys, I've helped you before. Don't you remember? Ah, I see, you don't". A beautiful artwork alone does not necessarily deliver an immersive experience. What was true for Scythe (at least in my book) also counts here. But Scythe is much more solid as a game

It was fine. I've played once so far. Benson has a tendency to sell games pretty hard and make sweeping generalizations that are often misleading. The game took way too long, though we enjoyed our play if it as a social gathering, but we had intended on playing Nippon, so I was disappointed a little, I think. I would play it again, though I don't think Shannon would like it as much as Benson claims. :)

Love this game! The artwork is cool, game play is similar to a light euro but it also has the story book which is a fun element. 
My only 2 complaints:

2) I wish the game lasted a little longer. There doesn't seem to be enough rounds. Just when you start to get rolling the game ends.

After first play - fun game. Liked the story telling aspect but found myself wishing they had taken it further. The story elements aren't related beyond the premise of exploring caverns. Would love to have seen story arcs dependent upon previous encounters and outcomes.

The game only lasts 7 founds which seems a tad too short to fully realise a particular strategy. Might feel differently after more plays. 

That aside, it was still enjoyable and would gladly play again. 10 year old loved it.

I can't believe I'm going to say this, because I am an enormous fan of Ryan Laukat's games, but I don't particularly love this one.  The Euro mechanics of village building don't mix well with the story components.  By that I mean if you want to gather resources to expand your village, you must go on quests.  But there is just no way to know what those quests will produce in terms of resources, and the whole process becomes a muddy mess.  If you want to enjoy going on quests and telling silly stories, this game will work.  If you want to engage the rest of the game at any meaningful level, you'll probably find yourself left a little without.

I love the storytelling element, I don't love flipping through the book of events every turn. This game could REALLY use an app, especially with narration.

First Impression:
An interesting blend of genres. Part adventure game, part euro.

It's a clean, simple to play game with fast gameplay and easy to learn rules. Still, lot's of options. I liked the workers in this one, they trully are different in a nice way, and it was fun reading the exploration book and reacting to it.

Although it works, it feels a bit lacking both as an adventure game and as a build your village game. Both aspects are OK, but none deliver the excitement you'd expect. You don't really feel that you've accomplished much with your village, and your adventures, though well written, all end up giving you something, more or less according to how big a party you sent.

It's an OK game, but somehow I expected more. The theme is open to greatness, but the game doesn't deliver that much. Still a fine game that I'd happily play again, but not even close to amazing.

Great little Euro with a "choose your own adventure" story book, similar to Tales of the Arabian Nights. The stories are well written and pretty fun and enchanting, and really help bring out the flavor of the game. On top of the story telling, the game itself is also very good! I especially like the Resources track at the bottom of the player board, where you have to choose between placing goods early to earn more revenue, or place them later to maximize your victory points. I really like it, and Lauren does too!

Above and Below is a game by Ryan Laukat, a designer and artist whose art style and games have been impressing me quite a bit lately. The game is half worker placement, half dice game. You start with three workers and three beds. Some actions can be performed by anyone, but other actions require skilled workers. Whenever you use a worker they get exhausted and are retired for the round. In the rest phase you can move an exhausted worker to active duty for every bed you own.

There's a market for workers (but only headhunters can hire people) a market for buildings (but only construction workers can build buildings), exploration (where any 2 or more people can go explore the caverns), harvesting (if you have fields to harvest), and a get-a-buck-if-ya-got-nothing-else-to-do space. Interestingly, if you're short on beds, you might not want to send all your workers out to do stuff, but rather save one of them for the next round.

You have an income every round. Buildings will give you beds, stuff to harvest, points, cool abilities, etc. There are some very expensive buildings that'll give you end of game points as well. There's an interesting thing with collecting harvest goods, where you have to allocate them to storage bins. Once put in a bin, that's the only item that can go in that bin. You get points for every item in those bins and each bin increases your income. But later bins score 2/3/4/etc. points for every good in them. So you really want to put your rare items in the early bins and save common things for the later bins.

All the above ground stuff is fairly straightforward. Then there's the underground stuff. All your workers have some ability to provide lanterns for exploration. Usually that means they get X lanterns if you roll below some number or y lanterns if you roll above that number. But there's also people that aren't very good at exploring, for example, a guy who only gives you 1 lantern if you roll 4 or above. When you explore you drawn a cavern card and roll a six sided die. Each result refers you to a number which you then look up in the manual. There's a little scenario you read which gives you a couple of choices, each of which require a different amount of lanterns. You then choose a path, roll to see how many lanterns each worker produces and claim your reward (or not). The reward is the cavern card (which lets you build one of the underground buildings later on which is usually cooler or cheaper than the above ground buildings) and some random other stuff, money, goods, etc. You can also overexert each worker for an extra lantern, but they'll have to stay in bed twice to return to work.

I liked the game a lot. Money was tighter than I realized. And getting rewards in the caverns was more important than I planned for. One of my exploration turns I rolled snake-eyes and came up short on lanterns which really hurt. The underground scenarios were a little hokey and I found myself wanting to skip them and just get to how many lanterns were needed without the flavor text background stories. But overall it's a solid, very pretty game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun and exciting Story Telling game, which is actually a game as well, and not just a process of telling a story.  Basically you take actions, to gain Money, Harvest, Buy buildings, buy villagers, and explore, etc.  There are different paths to victory, and the game ends up being tighter than expected.  

My only issue, is I feel like the game is too short for the engine building it offers.  I realize the reason to make it a shorter game, but you really have to decide what you are going for.  I almost feel like Harvesting should be one free free action per turn, that would eliminate having a villager have to be used, and would allow to explore more, which is the storytelling element.  Maybe having Villagers go straight to your pool when buying them would allow for more actions.  It just seems like once you get going, you are just preparing for the end, and cant do all that you want.  

All in all I really like the unique games coming from Red Raven games.

What an amazing production, the quality of the components is astounding.  The game itself is pretty good too, it's an interesting point salad type of game with a lot of theme.  The encounter book is written really well, although I wish there were more resolution texts instead of just stating the reward.  Losing an encounter is rarely very bad, and winning an encounter is sometimes quite underwhelming.  As far as the storytelling goes, I still prefer Tales of the Arabian Nights, but this system is much less fiddly.  The game is also pretty long, and some will probably think it's a bit bloated, but overall I'm very impressed.

Euro-style board games are a bit of a rarity in our gaming group. Above and Below blurs the line between a Euro type, serious worker-allotment board game, and a random encounters type game. The Arabian-nights style adventuring throws a bit of spice into the otherwise fairly-tame engine building game. Our only major complaint is that each game feels rather short, and ends before anyone's engine is running at max capacity. The artwork and universe created by the author is simply gorgeous, and the bright, vibrant colours are a nice contrast to the grey and browns of other, similar titles.

This is frustrating to play. On one hand, it tries to be a euro game, in which I'm trying to collect the right resources to score maximum points.

The stories may be too random for players looking for a super-tight WP, but I enjoy the little bit of chaos the rewards/failures and dice bring. 2 player was fine, but 3 player may be the sweet spot for this one.

Little to truly love, but plenty enjoyable.  Definitely fits the standard of a 'Kickstarter game' - looks pretty with design not fully fleshed out, though this one is better than most.

The storytelling aspect is lacking.  The writing and lore is fine.  However, results of expeditions are very bland - there is never any follow up story, merely an arbitrary list of a couple of resources gained.  They also felt less... varied, interesting, or rewarding than I'd expect.  This is likely good in terms of making the game less swingy, but has the downside of reducing tension and excitement.

The rest of the game is nothing special, but flows smoothly.  Enjoyable with some tough choices to balance, figuring out what to prioritize before other players get them, etc.  There's probably an extant early-player advantage (at least with 4 players) - the key cards can be quite strong and are limited, so the 3rd-4th player will have far worse choices available.

Oct 2017: -2 rating.  This game just doesn't get played much in our house because Curt doesn't enjoy reading the stories.  I really wish this got played more, and still believe it's a 10 in the right group.  Hopefully this rating can go back up in the future.

GREAT game!  It's not as deep or thinky as some games, yet it does still maintain the feeling of a true worker placement game with meaningful choices to make.  Do you build, labor, train, explore, or harvest?  There's no right or wrong answer.  The cards you build early on in the game can determine the strategy you'll take, which adds to the replay value because the game won't play exactly the same every time.  Exploring is icing on the cake.  The encounter stories are well-written and interesting to hear even if it's not your turn.  +1 for the lack of downtime and fun interaction!

This is a beautiful game.  It commands attention when it's on the table.  Also, I like the integration of the story element and appreciate that there are different strategies you can use to win the game.  It's a game that I can enjoy playing with gamer kids, as well as gamer adults.  The rulebook is very good, as well.

An excellent light euro with a story telling twist, great artwork and components. Has a lot more character and charm than your typical euro.

Feels like a much lighter version of Caverna and gets to the table a lot more often, due to being shorter and easier to play

Above and Below has some really interesting ideas and amazing artwork.  But it doesn't really mesh well together into a solid game.  The stories are neat, but they get repetitive quickly and don't really connect to the other elements of the game.  The buildings are another disparate element, with beds being too hard to get and contingent on a lucky draw.  Finally, the set collecting of goods is also highly dependent on luck.  I wanted to love this game, but it's half baked.

Beautiful artwork. Love the choose your own adventure element even though there isn't much cohesion between the resources you get and the actual stories. Choose your own adventure is probably the best part of this game. Kind of wish there was more cohesion between the resources you collect and the story but this might make the game too cumbersome. You have to be able to actually do stuff or else it's just a storytelling game. Outside of choose your own adventure, this game is mostly worker assignment and resource management.

RATING: 4
Left the game disappointed from the hype. Half a story and half a Eurogame, but those two halves don't make a whole game in this case. Stories weren't very interesting (with underwhelming rewards), rather play Tales of the Arabian Nights if I want stories. The Euro part of the game wasn't strong enough to hold the game up, very basic. Exploring seems under-powered, I started running away with the game when I ignored the exploring aspect and went fully into harvesting.

RATING: 5
It takes a long time to play for such a light game, and a lot of the choices are determined by the luck of the draw. Going later in turn order is a good way to get hosed, too, since all the good stuff is going to go before you even start your turn. Not my bag, baby.

RATING: 5
I really don't understand the high ratings on this one.  It is only interesting because it is a mish-mash of two different genres.  Each of the pieces is substandard and the mix doesn't appear to be geared toward anyone.

At its heart, it is a very basic engine building game.  Buy cards, get stuff, buy more stuff, etc.  There is nothing interesting in the game's core engine/mechanic.

One of the actions you can perform is essentially the adventure component from Caverna.  But, instead of just abstracting the action, Above and Below forces you to read a paragraph of incredible generic fantasy drivel, and then roll dice to see if you succeed (the results of which are completely random).  These "stories" aren't interesting.  Stuff like "you enter a pit, and there is a creepy lady with a pot of gold - do you want to save her or move on."  I definitely want to move on . . .  

All in all, the game works, but I think gamers will find the "game" dull and "stories" even worse.  It might work well for families, but I think that the "game" is too complicated for young gamers.

We really enjoy this game.  The art is great, the mechanisms are easy to learn and teach, and the game plays fairly quickly.  I learned the game at a demo at Dice Tower Con '16 and later taught my wife.  It was one of two games we ended up buying because of the con.  There is a really interesting exploration action that plays out similarly to a choose your own adventure book. There are some definite potential problems with the exploration (repeat stories, no congruency) but those problems do not bother me in the slightest.

Above and Below combines a Euro aspect (constructing buildings and collecting resources for victory points) with storytelling reminiscent to how Tales of the Arabian Nights works. It's a great game, but its biggest flaw is that it's too short, especially considering the setup time. Just at the point where you start to build up your engine, the game is suddenly over. A 2-player game with experienced players can be over in as little as 45 minutes. That is simply too short for the depth this game promises.

Fun euro-trash worker placement to exhaust and exert villagers to build huts and expand your village, teach and recruit more villagers and exploring the underground with dice-based storytelling decision paths. The varied race and species artwork of the villagers is beautifully done and adds so much personality to the game.  Some unique strategy decisions with the resources of different rarity deciding when to sell, consume, or add them to your earnings track. This game appears poised for all kinds of expansion possibility; another barbarian raid, a subterranean threat, certainly more storytelling content with untold future adventures.

RATING: 5
An odd combination of uninteresting Euro and infrequently entertaining story game.  More than anything, I wish that the encounters were more flowery and ambitious, instead of the perfunctory bridge/rock/troll encounters that litter the storybook.

I do think it's funny how my opponents, at game's end, took great pains to point out how my multi-person dungeon delvings were massively inefficient, which is why I came in dead last.  I couldn't bring myself to tell them that it was intentional, and that I only cared about achieving the toughest story outcomes (e.g. an 8-level explore, or whatever) - not racking up endgame bonuses.

After all, I didn't want to palpitate their hearts and orphan their collective children, so keeping my secret safe seemed like the wisest decision.

A very beautiful experience. The artwork is just incredible and the book of adventures is full of fun times(though no where as big or varying as Tales of the Arabian).

Mechanically the games sometimes feels to play itself. There aren't all that money choices and the majority of points are from a resource track, and getting those resources is pretty much up to the luck of the draw.

RATING: 8.5
Theme/Art:
It's Ryan Laukat, so the art is beautiful. The theme is great too, everybody I played with loved the exploring mechanic, because the stories you read to each others are great. Some are pretty basic like 'You see a lake with a boat, do you want to catch a fish or keep exploring?', but others are much longer (sometimes they spread over several paragraphs) or give you unique rewards.

Production quality:
Very good, especially the coins are great. Everything is thick cardboard, so it will last some time.

Replayability:
There are key and star houses which are different each game, the other houses, villagers and outposts are different in their order, same for the caves. Also, the encounter book has over 200 stories and a game of 4 players usually contains about 20encounters.
I guess it can get repetitve after 10+ plays, because you will recognise many encounters, but those 10 plays will be a blast!

Depth/Difficulty:
It takes about 15 minutes to teach and it is not very difficult, but it has quite a lot going on and the villager mechanic is very unique. It also takes a lot of space!

Strategy:
You should get some new villagers early on and try to explore a lot and hope you get lucky with your explorations. Or you can simply stack resource houses and fill your advancement track. So you can follow different strategies.

Luck:
There is quite a bit of luck involved, because everything you can purchase (houses, new villagers, outposts) has only a small selection for sale at a time, but the biggest luck factor are the explorations. Sometimes you explore with 3 of your villagers ready to beat everything the caves have to offer, but all you get is explore 5 and a coin and a fish. Then the next player goes into a cave and receives 5 coins, an amethyst and the cheapest outpost available. But I guess that's what you get from exploring dark caves!

Above and Below takes 75-100 minutes to play, depending on the number of players and their familiarity with the game.

I and all the people I played with loved the game and especially the exploration mechanic and its encounters. I backed Near and Far inclouding the new encounter book for Above and Below and can't wait to get it on the table!

This one has really charming art and fun writing. I'm a rather annoying person, so by now I have songs for a lot of the events (Like the hit "Rush Rush with the Glogos") and I have a lot of fun making stupid voices for the various characters. 

I think the only other game that I've played which had me reading through events was Agents of Smersh, but this one wins hands down for me. It's not just the writing, I also like that I get to choose where to allocate my workers, whether to build, train workers, harvest resources or explore caves (my favourite!). It's the one game where I don't even worry that much whether I win or not - though I do try - it's just that much fun to go through.

I did have the stupidest fun when I decided to sing "Ai No Tenshi" from Perfect Blue when some old woman in some event sang her song to her long lost love to remind him of her. 

I was really happy to know that there were additional events in a second book.

This game is interesting. In some ways it's better than Tales of Arabian Nights. The booklet is less cumbersome and figuring out which paragraph to read is not nearly as difficult.

I like the art and the concept but the game fell a little flat for me. I guess it became easy to see through the story aspect and not become immersed in the game very much.

This is one heck of an attractive game, and features a very playful art style. I find many components downright funny in how they are looked, but even at that it is still very clearly presented. This is one great looking package.

I feel like I like this way more than I should. It's a highly random game which makes it hard to love for eurogame fans, and it's perhaps too light on its theme to thrill ameritrash fans - at least this is true for me. This works best as a family game with young children in my opinion. Where you can play it just for the experience, and a good, fun time hanging out together.

This is a fun worker management game.  I really liked both how different workers have different capabilities and the mechanic for refreshing them for re-use.  I was less sold on the exploration part of the game, which is too bad since that's the most innovative part of this game.  I found the story book charming, but all that reading and dice rolling kind of bogged the game down.  I'd like to play again with a different group to see if playing more briskly makes this even better... but I enjoyed this enough to try it again for sure.

An action selection and exploration game that's super-heavy on theme.  There's a choose-your-own-adventurish book of short encounter stories.  The dice usage is comparable to that of Stone Age: you do roll for success/failure--which is bad--but there are plenty of ways to mitigate unlucky rolls--which is good.

Not very meaty but very cute.  I'm enjoying it now but I suspect that replayability will take a hit once I start getting familiar with the finite encounter book.

This is a really cool game. There's a little gamebook-style stuff in it, but most of it is clever resource management. The adventuring is to find diverse items, but there are other ways to approach it. I keep coming back to it. Of course, the art is quite charming, too.

Above and Below is an interesting mix of Euro-style worker placement and rather unpredictable story encounters. The game exudes charm with Laukat's identifiable art style, and laying out your town cards in a small panorama looks kind of pretty.

I've only played once, but it feels like the scoring is somewhat obtuse, especially with the way resources are done.

What a phenomenal game! All the art is just gorgeous, the encounters are really interesting and varied, and despite only taking 7 rounds (and having only one action first round), it took a surprising amount of time. This game has encouraged me to never hesitate again when it comes to a Ryan Laukat game, because he's a great artist, and the game plays so well.

Our first game, two of us explored like crazy, one person only built above ground, and the fourth tried to invest mostly in goods and buildings that make goods more valuable. The difference in score from first to last was only 7 points, which means there isn't only one way to play to be successful (the top two scores were the two explorers, but only one of us significantly benefited from exploring). We didn't get any of the special characters, so there's still more to see!

I think my only complaint is that it takes up so much of the table, but that's also a positive because there's just so much stuff and it's all lovely.

Excellent game with great art. 
The way exploring works is very novel (at least to me - haven't seen it before) and keeps things very fresh! We house-rule that if we get a repeat paragraph that we remember super clearly, we can (...must?) re-roll for a new paragraph to read. I think it'll be a while before we remember the whole encounter book enough for it to get boring!
There are several different ways to win and it can be quite the race by the end!

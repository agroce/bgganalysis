Space battles with cardboard components. Good rules and mechanics. Spend hours building my own ships. Was good fun, but, like all my other space battle games, hasn't been played in ages.

Good looking game pieces, interesting damage system, but too slow for a dogfight simulation. Computer games are better suited for this nowadays.

RATING: 6
Very good fighter to fighter space combat game.  We played so much that we took an entire table and put permanent 1" hexes on it.  The bookeeping gets a bit too much to manage if you play more than one fighter, so large groups playing as teams are the most fun.  Makes the game go faster too. Lots of add on material for this was produced (including capital ships), I have some of it, but it never really caught on with our group after that.  Still have it, but rarely play it these days.

RATING: 6.5
Good little space fighter game, although it does suffer a bit from Star Wars "swoosh" syndrome. (Fighters move like they are in an atmosphere. There are some pseudo-inertial jigger factors, but of a type that seems slapped on to me.) Some people found the damage flowchart confusing, but I thought it was fine. There's nothing wrong with the overall game, but I think the state of the art is a little better.

RATING: 5.5
space combat, fighters, really different damage mechanics, type of weapon determines damage pattern of hit and how it burns off armor, once hits get to inside, follow flow chart to see what system was damaged

RATING: 9
I like this game almost as much as Centurion. Great classic fighter game in space with unique flowchart damage system. The downside is that this is complex and makes the game take longer than an equivalent game of Centurion. You can really only play a few fighters on each side but it's still fun. There was a computer game which worked very well but is now sadly obsolete.

Yet another bad tactical space combat game to go along with all the other bad games in this genre that seemed to pop up in the 80's.

It had an interesting, though cumbersome, damage resolution system, but the game was otherwise pedestrian.

The damage model in this fairly simple tactical space fighter game is very interesting.  Damage is allocated with a flowchart that is specific to each craft.  Different weapons have different armor penetration patterns -- it's possible to literally blow undamaged armor off a craft through explosion effects.  Probably ground breaking with regards to the damage rules.  Set in the Renegade Legion universe, which I find to be very interesting.  If you only try one RL game though, make it Centurion (game about grav tank combat).

I have a soft spot for the Renegade Legion games.  I _really_ like the damage system (Nor do I see anything wrong with the flowchart in this one--it's fun!).

I also really like the 3d box counters.

Kind of fun tactical space game with velocity-based movement system.  It's all about the fiddly hit chart "circuit diagram."

Not as good as Silent Death, it&#039;s still quite intertesting. The movement rules are good, but the handling of damage is way too convoluted.

OK Game -- Will Play if in Right Mood - Great game for its time but now it's merely a good game. 

The computer version was way better because it automatically took care of the and armor shredding and the tedious flow-chart critical hits.

Silent Death has a much faster and smoother mechanic for space combat!

Derided for an overly complex damage system, I actually really like it - the templates provide weapon differentiation in a way that few other games have.  I also love building ships.  Too bad the rest of the game is only OK.

Interceptor, Battletech, two large Pizza Hut thin crust meat lovers pizzas, and three friends about three times a week and every weekend made for the perfect summer of 1988. This one will always have a special place in my collection, haven't played it in years unfortunately

This game was a great improvement in its day over other similar combat games (Battletech, CarWars, Star Trek, etc).  The movement was great and the weapons did different types of damages (spread out, in a line, in a cone, etc) rather than just knocking off armor.

RATING: 1
A witless piece of games design, with a movement system that falls apart in play and a damage system, using a complex flowchart, that beggars belief. This title is unexpectedly popular, presumably on the basis that fiddly detail adds value to the game. Having had to sit though hours of tedious damage resolution, I lost the will to live and resolved never to play this again. Oddly enough, this is an excellent example of bad design.

Cool game of fighter combat in space, but those internal damage charts... ouch. You can spend more than 5 minutes tracing the internal damage from big hits just to confirm that your ship has really been destroyed. This was solved in the 2nd Edition of the rules; have to try those next.

RATING: 7
Interceptor is a fairly standard 2D space combat game with two special features. First, damage to armor is tracked on a grid, with different weapons having different profile (so armor can be undercut, leading to a synergistic effect from two weapons that don't do so much harm individually). Second, internal damage follows a (wacky) flow chart that tracks its way through the fighter's guts. It's a bit cumbersome, but accurately reflects the feel of a lot of SF/space opera combat ("R2, the rear stabilizer's come lose!" -- not coincidentally, Interceptor was supposed to have been designed to be a Star Wars space combat game).

My recollection of this game is a bit vague, but I do recall finding it to be a neat alternative to Star Fleet Battles, which, at the time, was going through serious growing pains (a constant stream of rules errata on top of new expansions).

[BGCOLOR=#FF3300][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Wargame.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Tactical space combat game. We played the hell out of this back in college. Overall, I think I like it better than BattleTech as movement is a much more important part of the game. Really like the armor and damage system.

Awesome. Simply awesome.

If you're looking for semi realistic space combat this is it. I will never grow tired of a simple furball within this system.

Would love to play this paralel with Leviathan, in an strategic, double blind campaign.

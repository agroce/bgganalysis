Simple dice game with a bit of route-connection and bluffing card-play. It has beautiful dice but everything else is rather small (although attractive) so it's an odd production. The rules are very ambiguous regarding how to score routes and getting it wrong is game-breaking. I'm sure this is the cause of most of the negative comments on BGG. When played correctly, the game nips along at a decent pace and there are nice opportunities for tactical play to balance out the heavy dose of luck provided by the dice. There is nothing earth-shattering here, but it's a nice light game.

I honestly want to like this game. It sounds just fun! Worker placement meets rout connection? Whats not to like? But honestly the game is just not that fun. It's kinda dull to be honest. The lack of 2 player support really hurts the game in my opinion. Keeping score is clunky, card balance can be an issue, ambiguous rules, a microscopic board. Arrg. I would try a second edition.

Railway dice game which encouraged some co-operation in route building, but due to first past post nature the buildings/building cards were largely neglected.  Three locked trains gave 3 point negative penalty which was frustrating and unnecessary.  Some nice ideas but not a game I need to play again.

RATING: 7
For the length of the this game it packs a good punch. I think the low BGG rating might have to do with bad rules interpretation. I found this to be a balanced game with enough meat and strategy.
Though I'm still finding the balance between building cities or just going for routes.

It gives off a scent of an interesting game between Ticket to ride, Yaghtzee and Monopoly. In reality is a bit fiddly, not that intuitive to figure out. Got to try a bit more before the final verdict.

RATING: 5
TICKET TO RIDE's introverted little brother.  Warning:  I tend to rate games higher than they deserve.

It's a train game where you're placing dice on train routes connecting nine US cities, occasionally scoring victory points simultaneously with other players, and delivering goods (depicted on cards).  It's short, small, and easier to teach than it looks (assuming you are teaching it right--and some people aren't).  After drinking two glasses of wine, I was able to teach it to two people who have decidedly divergent tastes in games.  

It's a pleasant game for friends who don't analyze things too deeply and who don't worry too much if every element is provably fair.  However it is very poorly developed (there are some good improvements in the forum that I think can save it, especially with more than 3 players).

The problem is what drives the game "clock".  In good games the game length and progression to the finish or the endgame is driven by things like these:

1. Finite # of turns or rounds.
2. Attainment of a certain given score.
3. Achievement of a goal.
4. Performance of a mechanism that triggers an endgame or bonus procedure.
5. Depletion of a certain commodity, or hand, or draw pile, or anything NOT about victory itself.
6. In party games, passage of actual physical time might be the finish factor.

Those are acceptable mechanisms.  What you DON'T do is what this game does.  Here you have a finite bank of victory point *cards* with point values of 1 and 5 points printed on them.  When these are depleted (often quite quickly and with a lot of clumsy change-making), it triggers a rather samey endgame which could be as brief as one more player taking a turn but never more than once around the board.  This is completely disconnected from (and oblivious to) the other important element of building your buildings with dice triplets so that you can work on goods.

Anyway, you take these same victory cards that have been running down the clock, add 'em up along with some other points (missions cards for a few longer routes, etc.) and determine a winner.

Folks, I appreciate the originality truly, but you don't set a finite base of total available winning values and THEN divvy most of those up until they're gone to see who wins.  That would be exactly like playing a game with a traditional victory track, but keeping an eye on what everyone's scores are added together, and when this combination reaches x, ending the game or going straight to final scoring.  

Let me give you another example with a stupider game.  It would be like playing MONOPOLY and saying arbitrarily that when the bank has handed out so much money--no matter to whom--you stop and add up your money regardless of whatever else is going on--and possibly having to tally the last few dollars on paper.  I'm not saying that's necessarily unfair, but what's the rationale for that?  

I still plan to enjoy this now and then, but I would not force it on anyone not in the mood.  Anybody else know any games similar? Do they work?  I am eager to keep an open mind.

I was really not impressed with this game, but I have to say that I'm not sure we had all the rules right.  It's a quick dice roller where you place dice as trains on the board and build up stations.  Our 3 player game saw few stations on the board and just 2 or 3 routes completed and two of the resources never entering the game.  That meant the player who was dealt a card with one gold and a card with one silver scored 16 points from being dealt those cards at the start.  It fell very flat.

Jó játék a szokásos munkás lehelyezős módszerrel, melybe bőven sikerült újításokat is belevinni. Bár a téma igazából nem fogott meg, mégis egy szépen kivitelezett játéknak tartom. Rövid játékok közé sorolható, ha a gondolkodást nem húzza el egy-egy játékos. Nekem kicsit kevés körből áll, hogy igazán kibontakozhasson a stratégiám, de mégis úgy érzem, hogy még éppen megfelelő. Olyanoknak ajánlom, akik már egy lépőfokkal feljebb vannak az euro játékok között. Azért úgy érezem, hogy a szabályok nem elég pontosak és finomításra szorulnak. Mintha az apró részletekkel nem törödtek volna a játk tervezői vagy mi vagyunk értelenek. Érdemes kipróbálni vásárlás előtt, mert kétesélyes a játék.

Update: Must have been another play it once, review it, Glow Job Dice Tower review. Another I never get tired of dices, so I love it. You need to pass on this thing. Other then a shallow overview these days Dice Tower just seems shall we say "commercial", like a like of this kind of "business" we're outsiders get way too snugly to the industry they review. 

This game has issues, so wanted to love it.

----------------------------------

Want to try this, always looking for a short play light weight game for travel. $48 seems a bit to much for what it is. Not sure how well it would play with 2.

Hope it isn't anything like that Elder Sign POS, or Dragon Rampage, both make Yahtzee seem enticing.

Stefan Feld seems to know how to do dice.

Note to self: Tom V is a dice nut, take his dice review games with a grain of salt, Rolling Freight is not a substitute for Railways of the World, this statement finally convinced me.

Bought at Revolution Games in Calgary for $30.  A tiny board and tiny pieces.  Dice-based.  Different.  I play with the interpretation that majority bonuses are paid out once per city per route; I first tried it with awarding the majority bonus between every pair of cities in a completed route, but that was way too beneficial for the active player, who was awarded 3 bonus dice all at once.  His next turn using 3 bonus dice was a massive turn.

An okay game.  We played with 5 and exhausted just 1 deck.  Winning score was 50, second was 35 (me).

Very interesting game with multiple paths to victory. Have to be really careful though since the simplest (connect cities) doesn't give the most points and can be overshadowed by someone going for Goods/Power cards. Need to play a whole lot more to have a much firmer opinion.
One thing I know: the whole game should have been scaled up by 50% at least: the components are way too small!

UPDATE: Revised the rating after looking at the rules/board and doing some analysis. The game simply doesn't hold up as anything else than a fast diversion.

One that will likely fall into obscurity and leave the world under appreciated. With hits of Quarriors (not really to be honest) it is a fun dice game where you're building routes, connecting cities and trying to monopolize goods. This is a game that fits perfectly into the weight and time category meaning it is one that I should be playing, and enjoying, for years to come.

With one or two tweaks to the rules (primarily to change the way victory points are given out when connections are made so it slows the game down a bit and allows for the cards to come into play more), this can be a pretty fun game.

RATING: 5
This game is a medium train wreck, if you'll pardon the pun. While the components are good to great (the board is somewhat small), the rulebook leaves many questions open.
As to the gameplay: if you have two major ways of scoring points, and the points run out before you've really started using the second way, you have a problem. Also, the power cards are swingy: the winner in our game gained 14 points from a single power card, because the goods it depicted didn't even get to enter play.

RATING: 6
The game is fun, but flawed in a few ways. We played it with three players and the game was over way too quickly. Because of this, new goods didn't come into play and if you happened to get goods on your power cards at the beginning of the game (as opposed to routes), you were handed a 9- to 14-point lead. Just like that. Especially with three players, I'd recommend to use more points to make the game last longer.

The game is still fun, but it feels half-baked and that's a shame because it could have been better.

[i]Edit:[/i] I found out that we played one rule wrong, so I'll try it again to see if that changes the experience by much.

RATING: 4
A daring attempt at marrying Yahtzee-style dice-rolling and the typical shared incentives of train games. It's largely unsuccessful, and that's mostly because of the train game parts. The shared incentives just don't work properly, and straight scoring opportunities are usually much more attractive than subtle incentive manipulation. If you can score a delivery there is rarely a reason not to do it.

Buildings and the resource cards earned through them can supply a significant part of the final score but seem to be far too swingy to be taken seriously. There are too many dice results that are simply useless.

RATING: 9
Light dice rolling/placing game just right to lure people into more strategic games. You see, when you introduce the game people which do not like to be involved in any kind of heavier game will be sceptical. You can reassure them however that it is really simple. Though the components seem to indicate a much more complicated game the mechanics are quite simple and they make sense. So once you get the hang of it, it is really easy to grasp. If you are lucky people then will say: hey, there is a lot of luck involved, I want to have more control... BAM you got them.

The Vasel indicator should have warned me. Luckily, I was able to play Trains and Stations at Spiel 2013 and avoided buying it. 
Essentially, Trains and Stations is a small dice game blown up to a full-sized game. Unluckily, only the size of the box and the expectations were affected, gameplay-wise it remained a small-box dice game filler with lots of unfulfilled ambitions. The elements thrown into it like a map to complete routes, building infrastructure, collecting resource cards don't add up to interesting decisions as it's usually obvious what you want to do. If you can do it is a question of luck of the dice. This and luck in the card draws outweigh any decisions. I rather play [gameid=37380] or even [gameid=117942] instead.

This is a neat little game.  Dice games have been a little hit or miss for me---they can tend to be fairly rndom and games like Roll Through the Ages tend to be a little multiplayer solitaire even for me.  What's nice about Trains and Stations is that there is a central map that everyone is competing on, which forces interaction to occur.  There's a little route building mixed with a little economic engine and resource gathering.  The dice give you many different options, and even rolling the dreaded "locked train" symbols give you some advantages in completing routes.  I particularly like how you need money to "buy" re-rolls, so it's not automatic like other Yahtzee type games.

One thing that does feel a little off is that the different actions don't feel fully balanced.  It can be difficult to complete the longer, multi-city destinations since each leg of a route between intermediate cities is claimed as soon as it's completed.  You have to plan on placing dice to complete multiple legs of a route at the same time, which can be difficult.  The power cards can be a little random and swingy as well.  Still, this is one of the better dice games that we've played.

This title felt like a slapdash product that wasn't thought out properly. If the players work towards getting buildings out you might actually get some of those advanced cards but that doesn't seem to happen all that often especially if a few players roll tons of trains.

[Played once]

Dice and cards for a variant of Yahtzee that allowss you some choices, but feels very random.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Scoring is way too wonky and unsatisfying. Esp. given that the dice dictate what you can do, so getting multiples of certain goods is rarely an option.

RATING: 5
Clever Yahtzee. Dice rolling with a intelligent twist. Score points on the railway tracks, take money or collect goods with your dice throw. 

Like any dice throwing game, it felt rather boring. The intelligent choices you need to make couldn't prevent that. Only played a few rounds, but i can imagine that a full game will feel way too long.

RATING: 5
Tentative rating as my first game was a bit of a train-wreck. Seems you really want everyone to understand the game in order to make it balance out correctly. It's a quick game and probably simpler than the rules make it seem. We had issues with the bonuses. I scored 25 points from power cards, having been the only one in the silver, food and gold suits, having received at least 2 of those in my setup draw. As it comes with 50 attractive dice I'm sure I'll have a chance to revisit.

--- Preliminary thougths ---

Very light dice game that sounds much better than it actually is. It's a mix of TransAmerica and King of Tokyo, with different scoring mechanics).

Way too much luck driven, you get to take very few relevant decisions and the overall strategy is dictated by luck.

Too long for for a filler and way too light for anything else. Too expensive for the kind of game it is (includes many dices, so the price is fair component-wise, even if the components are too small; otherwise, these components are fine,and teh dice are eye catching).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Interesting concept but seems to be poorly developed and balanced, i.e. the major ways of getting points (cards, track, buildings) are largely disconnected and have very different values of attractiveness. This is especially evident from the fact that the Essen demonstrator constantly kept trying to steer us into playing the game in a very specific way. Also has huge point swings through the initial card deal.

A dice rolling game from the designer of Quarriors, that was a blind buy for me. This however seems to be of a totally different level. It's much lighter and I got the feeling that a bad dice roll (for instance with 2 mines and 2 ranches) is more unforgiving here then it is in Quarriors.

Also the power cards seemed to be very unbalanced. In our 1 game I got (from the start) a power card that gave me 1 silver and 1 food. As those resources never gotten into play, that was 14 points for me just like that (which made me win off course) and those things shouldn't be in a game.

So if you see this as a light game, with luck involved, that's easy to explain and plays fast, you gonna be OK with this game, but it you're looking for something with more strategy, this is certainly not your game.

Update: Originally the game seemed very shallow. Using the suggestion from Alex Fiedler we used the following rule.

When scoring goods cards, the majority holder scores 2 of them instead of only 1.
Then 2nd place majority holder scores 1 of the cards.

This made a significant difference in the feel and the depth of play. It is a much better game this way. I suspect Wizkids dumbed down the original rules as they did with Quarriors.



Another game of (very) simple points accumulation. There are many better and more interesting. Also,the icons on the board are so small God would need bifocals to read them.

It's a fun game to play when holding a glass of beer. Simple to get into and a bit random but I guess I would play it again. Don't like the lack of choices when other players close tracks for you as it's very chaotic and players can hardly control the close of a line for completing an objective card.

This is a fairly poor design. The game devolves into players building short routes as quickly as possible, ending the game before it even really begins. It feels like it needed a lot more development before being released. I don't own it anymore, though I probably wouldn't say no if someone wanted to play because there is at least the kernel of a good game here (and it is quite short). I'd rather play a lot of other games before this one, though.

I had played a 2-player game of this in Essen. This game is not made for two, and that became very clear as it completely lacked tension. But I thought it had potential, so I wanted to try it again. And now I have. With 4.
I must say that I like what the game tries to do. And it was significantly better with 4 than with 2. It plays well, it has some luck and some tension and it doesn't take too long. But I was still disappointed with this game. I got a fine little game. I had hoped for a fine little game that is surprisingly fun. And that last part was a bit lacking for me. It wasn't unfun, but still...
Anyway, a fine little game that doesn't fulfill it's promise. I still think [thing=23985][/thing] is Mr. Lang's best game to date (of those I have played)

Looks and sounds much more interesting than it is. For a game that takes almost an hour, it is too luck heavy for my taste - even for a dice game. What I especially do not like is the majority scoring on cards, when the way in which you obtain these cards is so luck driven. The rule for exchanging your commodity cards with a commodity that enters play later in the game makes this aspect even worse. Still, the game is not without some merit - at least the way in which routes can be claimed with train results is interesting.

This was more enjoyable than expected. Two things I didn't care for: 

The symbology was unapologetically worse than it should have been.  Bells get you chimneyed buildings which gets you pickaxes, but also sometimes crates of food or silver and/or gold.  Coal cars get you piles of coal, which get you... coal cars... and then also sometimes other things.  This could have been codified quite a bit better with minimal effort to make it more intuitive from the board.

Also, the -3 points from locked train cars is VERY harsh- a non-trivial percentage of a normal end score- and can just happen without pushing your luck any. Add this to the fact that you already pay for re-rolls, and punishing you for doing so is double-punishment.

But despite these things, it is still an enjoyable offering.

There seems to be more wrong with this game than right.  The dice element is neat, and I was hoping this might be a better implementation of Rolling Freight, but it's just a pale imitation.  For one thing, if you never roll coins (unlikely, sure, but still possible), then you'll never win.  I give it an A for effort, but overall it's just a mishmash of mechanisms that don't do much together.

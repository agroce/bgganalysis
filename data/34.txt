Better than the remake.  The game is quite compelling in that it is possible for all of the players to lose.  And indeed, it is the most likely outcome.  A quaint game with subpar components, but a charming feel to it.

Sadly, I am  a bit of a collector, but not for the cash value, just to have.  This game was pretty high on the collectableness charts, so I finally tracked down a copy at GenCon.  The one time we played it, I mis-interpreted one of the rules, Rudy latched onto it, and the game was all about my missing the rule from there.  What a great time.  I don't think that guy has EVER brought a game to the table, nor had to explain a game to anyone. Jark!

RATING: 9
Great game! I have played the new FFG version as well as this one. While the FFG version adds a lot of depth to the game and shines in many why, this one is much easier to learn and more simplistic. I especially like the artwork of this one!

Rating reflects a comparison between it and the rereleased version of Arkham Horror.  This one is still interesting, but for me the newer edition compares much more favorably.  This seemed more understated.

RATING: N/A
Good game with a great theme, although I really didn't much like the art in this original edition. Check out the remake by Fantasy Flight Games, its well worth it if you like RPG-style games. Games can go for a very long time, and it can be very difficult to win. I should also note that the components in this edition are diabolical (they feel like they were cut out of a cheap magazine).

An excellent game - probably the original co-operative game. The Chaosium edition is lighter in tone than the FFG remake, and is a classic in our group's estimation (dubbed "monster-bashing").

A repetative grinding 80s classic, with way too much dice rolling, random tile drawing, dice rolling, rules checking, dice rolling, etc until its time to see if we won or not.
Its not so much a game as an activity much like watching TV. Minimal decisions and control.

I have many great memories of this classic roll-and-move game. The game was essentially Talisman but with a lot of improvements. More choices in movement, more variety of action choices, a co-operative rather than competitive goal, and of course the strange lovecraft setting. I will never forget Harney Jones' Shack or Dark's Carnival, no matter how long I game! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.7
The main reason for the low rating is, of course, because I now have the updated Arkham horror, and hence no longer really want to play the old one again, except perhaps as a reminiscence of times gone past. Perfectly good game really, it's just that it's so simple now, and you can tend to repeat encounters quite a lot, given each area is a d6 roll. Still, for it's time, it's still quite good. I probably would have rated it as a solid 7 at the time it came out.

RATING: 7
There's a lot to be said for the original. It's just plain fun, and there aren't 6+ expansions to buy and learn, but it was good enough to inspire a re-implementation and all those expansions.

On the downside, there aren't 6+ expansions, and more people own/play the new version. The component quality is also typical of the era (i.e., extraordinarily cheap by today's standards).

This one's a blast. Fun but at times frustrating battle to prevent the return of the Great Old Ones! The only problem I have with it is that it is easier to defeat some of the Great Old Ones than to try to keep gates closed. So some players don't even try, and get angry when I try to close gates to get the gate token. Also, the game goes on forever and we almost never get to finish it. That said, this game's a blast and I highly recommend it.

Not as rich as the FFG version, but easier to put on the table and so charming. You've got to love the map and the "dark carnivale" reference to Ray Bradbury. The box art is beautiful too. Sold it (or threw it away) and bought it again at a much higher price. That's how silly I am !

The french edition had ugly components (box, character, the shapes of the monsters did not appear on the counters...). The chaosium version looks much better !

My copy (US Chaosium) is autographed by Richard Launius...

Finally got a copy, after a long search.  Had a couple goes solo, and got crushed each time.  What fun!  All sorts of silly encounters, and some nail-biting tension.  Played again with 2, and got slaughtered.  Also have played with 3, a couple games.  Well worth it, and sure like the board of this version better than the FFG redo.

Although I do enjoy the newer FFG version, this is nice to come back to on occassion when you just want a quikly set up little jaunt through Arkham, with the main mechanics the same, just easier to manage.

I'm looking for the original 1987 version of arkham horror- not the current FF version (which I have)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The first edition really shows its age with a board that shouts, 'roll and move' but essentially this offers up what we find in FFG edition, just without the bells and whistles. 

Instead of decks and cards we get D6 tables to determine encounters but the monsters are much the same. 

Key difference with 1st edition though is that there is no 'Ancient One' to deal with. It's simply a matter of closing all the gates in play at any one time. This really robs the game of a climactic finish. 

I'm glad I played this and got to see how it looked. FFG have the beter version for sure but I know this would have excited many a gamer back in the day in the late 80s.

Now you can say the art is terrible, the game is simple, the components poor but it was the 1987. Back then, this was a very good and well made game, with the right Lovecraftian feeling. Me and my friends consumed the game playing it. Ah, I have so many good memories about Arkham Horror

I like this one much more than the newer 2005 Arkham Horror, which is just way too bloated for its own good. The only real downer is that managing the monsters can be a pain late in the game. I am toying with some monster limit rules as in the new game to help with this.

(Ye Elder) Gods, how I love this funky old game. Sure, it's Candyland with Shuggoths. Yes, some of the rules are clunky as all hell and the map can become a mess of wandering critters. But I adore the look and art and oddly depressing play mechanic, and falling into the gates as you meet your fate has never been so much fun. 

Sacrilege, perhaps, but I prefer this over the new version(s). It was easier to see and work with, at least for me, and the characters felt more 'there' for some reason. I just wish I could get more folks back into it, but they've all moved on to the new ed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I've only played the 1987 version of this game a few times, but it's still one of my favorites. My dad picked up the updated edition, with all the fancy chrome, but traded it off almost immediately. 

If you're a narrative junkie, and love heavy Gothic themes, with brooding environs, and shadowy creatures lurking in the dark, then the original Arkham Horror may just be the game you're looking for (if you can find it). I think it's one of the best narrative games I've ever played. 

If you're imagination impaired, or prefer an action movie to a book, then stay far away from this game. 

The monsters are coming, and you must gather up your resources, and work with the other players to end the threat to humanity. This struggle necessitates your characters growing in their skills, and acquiring deadly weapons and artifacts. If you succeed, the crisis is averted, and the world may once again slumber safely (at least until the next eldritch terror awakens from its eons old slumber). 

You roll and move, read passages from a narrative booklet,  fight monsters, and acquire stuff. It's a great adventure, but not without its flaws. 

The rules booklet does not cover every eventuality that could come up in play. You may be left scratching your head during a game, wondering how to resolve a fight, a monster blocking action, or how various spells and weapons work together. Common sense must prevail in these instances. As a rule of thumb, since the source material is drawn from H.P. Lovecraft, simply ask yourself:

"What interpretation of the rules screws the player the most, without breaking the game?" Once you've answered that question, ambiguity in the rules seems easier to resolve. 

Also, the set up takes a while, because of all the various bits used during play. 

Still, it's a great and spooky ride, and well worth the long time investment.

Games feels a bit more streamlined than FFG creation.  Probably due to simpler die rolls (D6 or 2D6) and look up tables instead of multiple decks of cards.  Also characters are more static (don't adjust 3 sets of traits each turn), so game tends to move along a bit quicker.

Game does build tension nicely.  Investigators start a bit weak, needing to get spells/items to close gates.  But once powered up, a race starts to close all the gates before too many are open in town.  I enjoy the game as a nice change from the FFG version, but only the diehard fans need to own both.  Most will be happy with one version or the other.

The poorly-organised and messy rules hide the fact that this is a fairly simple game but with plenty of content.  The concept is faintly ridiculous, but there's enough Lovecraftian detail to satisfy, and the game is well balanced, obliging the investigators to keep on closing gates and keep the monsters off the streets whist the Doom of Arkham comes ever nearer.

Random and silly, but it is a lot of fun.  Nothing like trying to dodge the monsters as they run through the streets.  Hide out in the houses as they pound on your door, OH NO! The Hounds of Tindalos coming in through the corners.  The end game is totally screwy, the two rule books are irritating, and the abiguities are tiring.  While the new version is superior in most ways, the chase through the streets is better in this game.  Also the ability to create your own characters is rewarding.

From reading the rules, the original version of the game doesn't look that much easier to play than the remake, but I will say that I think I prefer the art of the original--more subdued, more what I think of when I think of Lovecraft, compared to FFG's nice but slightly garish, Hollywood-ized art.

Unlike it's re-implemented version (Fantasy Flight, 2005), this masterpiecce has all the atmosphere of the Mythos in it.

The fundamental design of moving about Arkham and having encounters at various locations is the same, but this was far more concise.

I thrifted an older edition from  I believe Chaosium. I can't imagine playing it though knowing how shiny the Fantasy Flight version is.

If you've grown too old or busy for D&D.. this game is a great alternative.

I loves me the Lovecraft, so naturally I had to have this game.  The gameplay is all right... higher ratings are due to good execution of theme.

Was given the first edition back in... 89? I think, by a roommate who owed me some rent money. We'd attempted playing once or twice, but were usually too drunk back then to grok really complex rules :) It *might* possibly be in a box packed away somewhere in my attic (in terrible condition, road in the trunk of my car for *years*) but I think it most likely was still in the trunk when I totaled it a few years later. Wish I still had it just for the nostalgia :(

Edited: Found it in my games closet; I do still have it! And in awesome shape. What the hell game was I thinking of in my car trunk...? Anyway, will try to do a playthrough in the next week for nostalgia :)

Purchased this game when it was first released. It has become a family favorite and group favorite.  I was lucky enough to pick up an additional map and box when Chaosium found a stash of them.  I like the new game as well but this was the first horror game that I ever owned.

I really enjoy playing this. I like both the old version and the new one. I think I like the old verson a tad more. It's brutal. I'd play it more often if I could get other people to play with me.

Was fortunate enough to play this with Richard Launius himself at Arkham Nights 2016.  Had a great time.

Played once yet.  Quite long and boring, but we started playing at 1:30 AM... It may be the reason.
Too many dice to throw and not enough dice in the box...  I guess there is a way to have "fun" with this game.  I can't find out the way.

I enjoyed the original although it was a bit hard, I let it go when I couldn't get anyone to play it anymore...thinking about getting the new version

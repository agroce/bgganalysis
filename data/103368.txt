This games has been very well received by just about everyone who has played it in my gaming groups which suggests that just about everyone will likely find something to like in this game.  A very nice, easy to play, quick "programmed actions" abstract.

I’ve only played the 'basic/standard' Epigo once and my first impressions are - it is nice little game with interesting choices. I’m going through a pure abstract strategy phase at the minute and while I don’t mind trying to second guess your opponent, it still boils down to a ‘guess’ even an educated ‘guess’. It definitely felt like Field Command light. Which is a good thing as Field Command could go on for 2 hours while Epigo seems to be a nice quick 20 minute version. 

I did get a little worried near the end of the game though. I foresaw that there could come a point where, the initial attacks have faded out without a win. It could then take a quite few moves and quite a bit of time to get in a game winning position again. This could potentially drag the game out of beyond its short and quick category. It never happened that way though and the game was won within a nice time frame.

A great casual abstract strategy game that has luck via the simultaneous programming element which creates fun chaos and gives a newer/weaker player a chance but still leaves lots of interesting strategy.  It can feel a little flat at times and whilst the different rules / set up options add variety they also highlight that there is not a more fully formed version that hits all the spots.  Overall lots of fun and I will always be happy to play this even if it wont always be my first pick.  It manages to be a distinctive 2 player abstract strategy game with a great app version.

This is a great game.  The rules are simple to understand, and the tension created by the decision making makes this very fun to play.  Games can be completed in less than 20 minutes.  Have not tried the variants yet, but the base game is really fun.

A nice depth of strategy considering the how easy it is to learn and the small amount of pieces. I love the abstract nature of Epigo. It's a great introduction for those unfamiliar with abstract and/or strategy board gaming.

RATING: 8
The base game is a taut give and take between the players, where you must try to out-predict your opponent. However, it REALLY shines when you play with one of the many variants. 

To make it easy on you, the rules include a way to randomly select which variant you are playing that round by drawing two Epigo tiles and matching up the numbers to their listing in the large, easy to read rules. 

If you play, you should play multiple rounds, with a random variant each round.

Pre program abstract game.

The comparisons to Roborally are on the money. I don't care for Roborally, so I should have known better than to acquire this game. How in the world do you force a victory? The players in our games have had little difficulty maneuvering their pieces out of trouble. The rules themselves acknowledge the possibility of a draw. Maybe one of the variants or more adept use of the super slide will shorten and improve the game. I'll give it a few more goes.

A bit like an abstract Robo Rally.  Plan your next three turns, trying to second guess your opponent's actions.  Then watch as turn by turn goes by.  On each one player priority is determined and then each person's action is carried out in turn - with potentially vastly unwanted results depending on what has come before during that series of 3 turns, or by the person who beat them to priority order on that turn.

I have no idea how crazy this might be 4 player.  It is good at 2.

Epigo is another interesting abstract to add to the list. It is difficult to come up with a grid-based abstract these days that doesn't feel like a checkers/chess variant. Epigo has its own thing going on by having a programming system. Players must choose which three pieces to move before they are moved. Of course, there are various blocking and movement rules depending on what your opponent also plays, but these rules are minimal and keeps the game from feeling bloated. What is nice is the variant booklet, offering 21 variants for the game to keep things fresh (not that it would be entirely easy to get sick of the base game). With an obvious layer of chaos and prediction, the game requires as much Jedi skills as it does tactical with-it-ness.  Because it has programmed movement and is an abstract, this is probably one of those "taboo" games that abstract fans will either love or hate.  I quite like it, and I'm not a fan of programmed movement games! But in Epigo it works quite well to create scenarios of bluffing and out-thinking your opponent- or over-thinking yourself!

Full disclosure: I was one of the developers of this game.

Epigo is a pretty simple game where both players plan out 3 turns at a time and then reveal and do them at the same time.  Because of this, you have to anticipate what your opponent is going to do so you can work off of his moves as well.  Playing your opponent is a large part of this game.

The game also comes with 21 variants, which are really the heart of the game.  The base game is fun in itself, but I always prefer to play a variant that I have not played in a while.  My favorite part of the game is playing a new variant against someone who has also not played that variant.  You read the variant and then come up with your strategy.  Often the perceived strategies are wrong, and the game becomes pretty comical as one person takes advantage of that.

The strategy in this game is pretty deep and the variants offer a huge amount of replayability.

Reasonably fun abstract but doesn't quite have a "wow" factor. I think the GIPF series fills most of my abstract needs for now, so while I probably won't keep this, I would play again sometime if someone asked. (Not likely because not many people I know own it, but that's an aside.)

I had the extreme privilege of playing this in pre-production, and it easily became one of my favorite abstracts.  The player interaction is great, requiring you to constantly try to "get into" your opponent's head.  If the base game weren't enough, you get a ton of variations that will keep the game fresh for a long time.

A perfectly-matched programming game. It's exactly what I would expect from an abstract strategy. The variants are interesting, play is interesting, it's not too "thinky" and not to "luck-based"... just a great game.

At some level, I can understand why this isn't well-rated on BGG—I'm sure many people don't "get it" and get frustrated. ...Plus, it's one of those games where you can't easily pull in a newcomer, since there is skill involved, and they are going to get tromped... but that's true of every abstract strategy ever, soooo... 

I dunno—again, I think this game is _brilliant_.

Played a number of new games at Gencon 2011 and this was by far my favorite. The rules are simple to learn and understand, yet the large number of variants provided made each game novel and entertaining. The game has each player submit multiple turn orders and once, and it was always enjoyable to see not only just how successful you were in anticipating your opponent's orders but how far your vision of the resulting layout diverged from the actual final result. One of my favorite aspects to the game was that while playing, at no time did I feel railroaded into making one and only one "correct" play. The blocking feature ensures there is plenty of flexibility each turn in issuing orders (which occasionally can be a bad thing for people like me who suffer from 'paralysis of analysis').

Great 2-player game. It's very simply idea is executed to perfection! My wife and I played this for the first time and we had a great time. You can trick your opponent into a sticky situation. However, it often happens that you over think it and as a result stick yourself in a bad spot! It's awesome! One of the best two player abstracts out there.

A good game I hope--more plays will tell. So far I'm having difficulty discovering good tactics and find the cat-and-mouse/get in the other guy's head/guessing aspect of the game generally more stressful and frustrating than fun. Haven't tried the variants yet; fingers crossed. Game board and pieces very nice, although a folding board would have allowed for a box half the size; rules well done, no ambiguities. [5 plays]

I found it to be dull, even with so many variants to choose from.  In a 2 player game, pieces can get scattered and getting that third piece shoved off the board can become quite a time consuming chore.  As such, the game can drag much longer than the game is able to provide interest.

Surprisingly, not a bad game. It's fairly chess-like with a nice battle of wits with the order that you play your cards, since you can play the same number as your opponent to cancel one of his moves. Not tons of strategy in this one, but enough to warrant occasional play. The number of variants adds for some nice variety to the gameplay, as well.

--- Summary ---
The board is a square grid, with several corner spaces removed. Players set up by placing their numbered (1-7) "Epigo" tokens in the center rows. Place them simultaneously, including the "X" which is then removed. Each turn, players program movement for 3 pieces, revealed one by one. If both players choose the same number at the same time, skip those. Moves include a slide of 1-2 spaces, or a push if the number of your pieces equals or exceeds the other player's in that row (counting from the moving piece to the first empty space). If you push a piece off the board, its owner loses a point. The first player to lose 3 points loses the game. 

I guess it's probably a good abstract, if you're into that sort of thing. There are 21 rule variants included in the game, so that should help keep it interesting even longer. However, we're not big fans of abstracts so we did not hold onto this one.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Rating TBD. I was playing with a not-very-enthusiastic opponent (my daughter, who I dragged away from her Wii) and that may have colored my experience.

I love two-player abstracts and I love simultaneous movement, so this game should be a natural fit for me. Initial thoughts are that it will be very difficult to formulate and carry out any plan. The game moves forward in such small increments, and those increments can be quite chaotic. I kept wanting to move a piece twice on a turn.

We didn't even finish our first game because (a) I could tell my daughter was not enjoying it, and (b) at one point I forgot what color I was and completely screwed myself up. We abandoned the game and she ran back to her video game.

So, to say I have not come close to giving EPIGO a fair shot is probably an understatement. As I stated before, I *should* love this game so I am looking forward to trying it again under better circumstances.

A note to developers: This game looks like it would make an AWESOME iOS app. EPIGO WITH FRIENDS?

Its extra abstract roborally! Without lazers... or a race... or random card draw.  It seems to simple when you first explain the game but by turn two or three you should be feeling the magic in this one.  An excellent abstract that has more appeal to folks that don't usually care for abstracts due to the bluffing aspect of play.

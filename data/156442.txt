A very derivative, light, resource-conversion exercise. There is little that's new here. The art-style is attractive and gives the game some "presence" but the components are a real mixed bunch and the graphic design is distracting. It's a slightly sub-standard example of the genre, but you could do worse.

Decent worker placement game, but doesn't do anything innovative or particularly interesting.  A bit reminiscent of Euphoria.  Has neat bits.

Yet another worker placement game. The twist on the genre is that a worker can be bumped out of place by another thus making the bumped worker available for play immediately rather than waiting a full turn to place it again. The game's saving grace it the designers didn't take the game seriously.

Backed the Kickstarter.
Wow, this game got heated fast. 
I thought it would be a nice little worker placement game, but with in 5 turns it became a big race. 
Turns are fast and the bounce mechanic worked really well.

Slam DUNK!  All I can say that it is just an expansion or two away from being ranked 10 (need more ruff cards).  I was a Kickstarter backer, and really enjoyed picking the ships, the sayings on the Ruff cards, and the transparency of the designers throughout the process.  Once I got my copy, I pulled the game out to play with 6 players with my group, and everyone absolutely loved the game.  Then, several weeks later, they went to BGG Con and it was a big hit there.  So, essentially, we thought it was awesome BEFORE the hype (i.e. we ain't no hipsters).

I am glad that the game makers got the Dice Tower seal because I hope more and more people will enjoy the game.

Pro's:

1) I love the orange aesthetics of the game, It really stands out when you actually see it in action. The pieces and the components are also adorable. Honestly I probably would have bought this game just to have it even if I never wanted to actually sit down to play it.
2) Great theme, I have a love of Sci Fi and there are many many references for those who enjoy the genre. As an extension of this I have found some great levels of humour and table talk as a result of those references.
3) Good newbie friendly board game, but to me at least way less stale than most other games generally seen as gateways. Plus the benefit of being able to play a high player count out of the box.

Con's:

1) I guarantee you will find people that are put off by the aesthetics, for every person that thinks it's amazing I think you'd likely find just as many that think it is horrendous.
2) The pirates and that whole mercenary deck can get really silly sometimes, you can have the board completely fill with these characters to the point that it becomes obnoxious.
3) The game can get surprisingly mathy sometimes. For a game that is this light mechanics wise I wish the points were a little less tight. Though maybe I just think this way because so far I have not won a single game as I keep screwing up my counts.

This game did play 7 players well. Gameplay is simple (2 actions a turn--place ship or take ship back). Where you place that ship is the crux. If you can get other players to "bump" your ship back" you'll get more turns and have an advantage. Game can promote Analysis Paralysis. Game has a good sense of humor. Color Scheme is awful. Enjoyed my first play. Wouldn't request this, but wouldn't turn it down either.

RATING: 6.5
Light little WP game, which would be totally forgettable if not for the neat "Connection" board, allowing players to customize and optimize their moves. Having the Trobils public is also a nice touch, as it makes the game a little more tense. The RiffRaff cards are random and can be kind of annoying, though they do break the monotony of the main game. Cool bits and fun theme.

Fun Game, backed at the PnP level on kickstarter. My husband and I got a play in the other night. I had made carrots, slugs, and ships out of fimo and used my die cutter to cut out the traps and credits. Used bedazzle style gems as crystals. Very pleased with the quality of my print and play. Gameplay was interesting, seemed very familiar to us as a typical worker placement, but the bumping mechanism paired with the connection cards was unique. Theme is awesome, I actually like the orange :)

I've been most excited about this game.  I've got to be voted in as one of the riffraff characters in the game, of which I've used as my avatar.  I also made a microbadge with me on it linked to this game.  [microbadge=34671]  I've also created two more microbadges for this game: [microbadge=34669] and [microbadge=34670]

Aside from this, the components are top notch.  My kids love playing the game.  It's quick and easy to learn.  I'm a fan.  Oh! and whenever someone picks my card we have a house rule that that person gets a free resource of their choosing.

Asking for Trobils is a worker-placement boardgame where the player is trying their best to rid the star system of Trobils (space pests). You play a Trobil Hunter - flinging the space vermin into the star, and dealing with unsavory folk just to get the job done.

I love orange. If there are orange pieces, I want to play them. Asking for Trobils is too orange even for me. But this does not make it a bad game. It is one of the most unique worker placement games I own. The universe is immersive and the concept of the available spaces makes sense. The options are endless and every decision matters, but in the same time the game is designed that way that there are rarely AP problems.

Another ubiquitous Kickstarter game that I hadn't heard about until it appeared in front of me.  Bog standard worker placement game (think Tzolkn - either place, or withdraw), build an engine to collect stuff, turn that stuff into other stuff, and finally turn that other stuff into victory points.  Entirely familiar, but pleasant, sort of amusing, and well produced.  Designed for tight finishes.  It was okay.

backed on kickstarter.  first backed kickstarter game.  light worker placement game without direct conflict.  bumping people out of the way to go get resources actually helps them since they get their ship back.  wonderful aesthetic with lots of oranj.  great communication from the designers as well made the kickstarter experience fun.

RATING: 6
A fun, and very light worker placement game, with a brilliant bumping mechanic which injects a healthy amount of player interaction. Gameplay is fun, but the simplicity of the pick-up and deliver mechanic doesn't pack enough punch. It takes a while to ramp up as players struggle to get more ships and build connections, but the fun mounts quickly thereafter. Regrettably, the various resources vary drastically in utility. Ore is used in capturing Trobils, acquiring ships, and purchasing mega-traps, while Crystals are only used to harvest space slugs. This causes Ore and Credit connections to be bought up almost instantly, with a large ROI, but Carrots and Crystals can stall the market for ages. While a bit too light overall, Trobils is an enjoyable and friendly worker placement.

For a game that's comprised completely of blue, orange & white, this is a gorgeous game! Beautiful production quality, although I would have liked to see something besides cubes used to represent traps (but I'm just being picky). Worker placement game that's simple enough to use as a gateway game or to play with kids...but has enough depth to enjoy as part of a gaming evening with other gamers. Very thematic. Very charming.

As a worker placement game, Asking for Trobils is a very simple collect resources to fulfill contracts routine. There are some interesting mechanics that spice it up, though. There are no rounds. Place a worker, then its the next player turn. If all ships are placed, take a turn to recover your ships. There is also a displacement mechanic where you are able to bump other's workers off a space. You get the space action, and the opponent gets their ship back to use. This routine makes the game accelerate nicely. Added to this, there is a slight engine building where you can add unique benefits to each location. The components and artwork are great, and the game has the right amount of subtle references to popular sci-fi properties. Trobils is simple, but worth checking out at least once.

Tried a print-and-play version of the game.

There is a good light worker placement game there to be salvaged, but as it stands, the game was fun for the first half-hour but lasted about 75 minutes (splitting the difference between the "45-60 minutes" as stated on Kickstarter and the "90 minutes" on BGG. The game we played was a 5er).

I enjoy the theme and the humor, but found myself looking at the resources as nondescript ones to be taken and converted into other resources and then into victory points. Compared to other light worker placement games, I find the theme less well integrated than Euphoria (which shares a bumping mechanism) but better integrated than Lords of Waterdeep. To be fair, the experience might be different with actual playing pieces rather than print-and-play ones.

Overall, lighter than the aforementioned worker placement games (Euphoria and Lords of Waterdeep), both in terms of strategy and in learning curve. For those who have played worker placement games before, this game can be picked up very quickly. For those who haven't delved into worker placement games, this can serve as a good gateway game for this genre. The biggest problem, the extended playtime, nonetheless remains.

Some interesting mechanics, it's kinda just like pick up and delivery though. Three orders that you're working on at any one given time and you're collecting resources then delivering them to the order... Seems a bit one dimensional.

But I suppose it does do that in more interesting ways than other similar games

RATING: 8.4
[i]Very[/i] glad I backed it. While it's light-medium, it's very engaging. Your turns are quick and in the two player game (all I've played so far) it is a tight game with a surprising amount of stepping on the other player's toes. The bumping mechanism is great because you are always tempted to just kick them out to get the resource you NEED but to give them that extra turn. argh! The connections really make the game for me, though. To be able to customize each station to give me MOAR! is great. Lost the last game in part due to spending too much time boosting that up :-D! As for the riff-raff, my wife wasn't a huge fan of them (other than the Courtesan cards) but I think they all modify how I play even if only a little bit and I like the variance they offer.

Overall, this game is a gem and I can't wait to try it out in the other play counts.

This is a shining example of how great Kickstarter can be.  I love everything about this game, from the simple mechanics to first-rate components, the humor and, yes, even the mostly-orange color scheme.  The mechanics are so simple, you can get literally anyone playing in minutes.  this is a hit with my less-gamer family.  It will probably bore a group who is comfortable with board games after a play or two, but I would consider this the paragon of worker-placement gateway games.

I really enjoyed the the fact that you can push someone out of their spot, it adds something really interesting to the worker placement aspect.
However some cards are weird since they stick around and never go away from the main board. At some point it becomes slightly overcrowded.
Since the game is rather light, I would be only playing the game as a gateway game or with kids, therefore, the game beeing in English is an issue.

improved riffraff cards, and the board is more immediately straight forward as to space ship placement and the goods you get. a little less 2D feel too. 

keeps the plastic space ships but replaces the wood bits with cardboard punchouts. the cardboard bits look good and i like them. 

Am only interested in the new edition from Breaking Games

Really great worker placement game, with a nice board and some very clever mechanics. The ability to upgrade your ship, such that you get resource benefits from visiting certain actions is really interesting. 

Also, I love the bumping mechanic. Instead of punishing players by not letting them perform an action space that's already occupied, it instead lets them go there while still rewarding the player who got there first by letting them get their ship back without wasting a turn on ship recall.

Love the Asking for Trobils​. Took it up to my FLGS, Gerard's Gaming​, and played it for the first time. Everyone had a ton of fun and on the request of my friends it has found a home in my board game tub.

One of the best parts is how easy everything is to understand. The game arrived Friday. I read the rulebook once. Saturday I read the rulebook out loud to my friends while we punched token and applied stickers. We then went into the first turn. We did not have to reference the rulebook a single time. So few games have rules that are understandable enough that with just the references printed on the board you don't need the book. Additionally, we all agreed that despite the ease of play it appears [first game play so grain of salt] to have enough options and strategies that your turns still mean something.

2 for 2 Kraken Games​. Make sure you put me down for your next Kickstarter!

Okay as an introduction to worker placement. The bonus cards that are revealed only at the end are rather pointless as you can't plan for them. The bulk of scoring is from the alien cards and the bonus cards are a small consolation prize. Would be much more interesting with more powerful  bonuses revealed at the start of the game and the possibility of using the upgrades in conjunction with those for multiple paths to victory.

A neat and fun worker placement game with high player interaction due to the ship-bumping mechanic.

A couple years ago, I tried to be a game designer. Collected some nifty game mechanics, slapped on some good ideas and gather a bunch of friends. 
The experience was horrific: some resources were stockpiled without game effects, other were only interesting for a short period of time, some random mechanics could turn up to make an average player an unstoppable victory point machine... This lacked, of course, game testing and dragged on for far too long to end up in a splash of non-sensical objective cards. 

This is exactly the same feeling I had when I played this game. Only I was not playtesting a friend's quirk...

--- First impressions ---

Light worker placement game with 2 interesting features:
-> Workers do not deny spaces to other players; they can be bumped by them, but the owner has to invest a turn into retrieving them if they are not bumped (similar Euphoria).
-> You can customize some of the sites by buying tiles that will grant you (and only you) additional resources when going there. This is a great idea, but I'm not totally convinced about the way it works.

I think some spots (the customization and the money one, especially) are much more interesring than others, especially at the beggining. Everybody is going to go there during the first turns (the ship creation spot too), and then people will forget. That pretty much carves a path for all the players. I believe this will affect replayability on the long term. I prefer more open games, like Euphoria or Alien Frontiers.

Overall, it doesn't have an important great strategic content. It can work as a light family worker placement game if you don't own many of them.

The art is cool (maybe too much orange?). It reminds me a bit of Alien Frontiers, but more in a comic art way.

The Kickstarter price to Spain is really expensive.

Super-fun, amazing space setting hunting aliens while outfitting your ship and mining resources. Loads of humor in the riff-raff cards, beautiful artwork, quick and easy gameplay, excellent game balance. Out-fucking-standing!

Was disappointed by this.  Was expecting it to be better.  More style over substance.  The basic principle was just go somewhere, get stuff, go somewhere else, change stuff into other stuff, collect stuff.   Nothing new, exciting or clever in any way.   The cards were a bit random.  And also, the pirates and courtesans were just fiddly.  Standups on the board, not clear which is which, just didn't really work that well.

My son enjoys playing this with me, and I rate it primarily as something to play with my kids.  Pretty fiddly, but a decent introduction to worker placement for kids.

I hope you like the color orange!  Asking for Trobils is a worker placement game of space exploration and ridding the place of those awful trobils!  Players visit different parts of the galaxy to obtain the items needed to capture trobils.  There are some unique aspects to this game including "bumping" people off occupied spots which saves them a turn retrieving their ships and a unique customizing feature for your ships which will get you more benefits when placing your ships at locations.  Fun to play.

This would be a fantastic light worker placement game if the quoted play time was correct. I like that it supports so many players, and the art style is appealing, but I am afraid it outstays its welcome. This can probably be fixed simply by removing cards from the Trobil deck. Future plays will tell.

I don't want to give it too much of a bad rap after just 1 play, but I'm pretty good at knowing what I like. It's a fine worker placement game, but I fear that it won't be able to find a good audience. It wasn't as clean and simple for new gamers and the theme and game play probably won't work well with veteran gamers. I actually think Lords of Waterdeep is better for beginners and there are numerous better games for the hard core gamers.

Mostly, this is a completely mundane worker placement.  Get stuff, turn stuff into other stuff, turn that other stuff into points.  Repeat.  It has a mildly interesting upgrade mechanic, and a bump mechanic similar to Euphoria.  The theme and matching color scheme are well executed, and the components and art are excellent.

As is, I find it a bit drab and a bit long, but with hope.  With a few modifications to speed it up, I like it a lot more.

as is: 4/10, maybe lower
with slight acceleration: 6/10, maybe higher
(see variants section -- remove the 5 Trobil cards from game even when using more than 2 players)

:) Really good components
:) Works with families and gamers

:soblue: Needs more of the RiffRaft cards (unique characters you encounter)
:soblue: A little too simple
:soblue: Crystals are not as powerful as everything else it seems
:soblue: Zero player and turn scaling. This can be fixed with house rules though.

Fantastic whimsical ORANGE worker placement game that is great for families.  Too bad it didn't get wider distribution and that I missed the KS bandwagon for it.  I have played it a couple times and each game I learned more of its depth and was impressed with how it scaled well with more players or less players.  Beautiful components too.

Played once with 4P. Asking for Trobils is a gateway level worker placement game, although I will have to reserve my rating for now as we played with a major rule wrong. We were taught that the bumping rule was only for 2P games, so we stuck to the generic worker placement mechanism where we took turns placing workers down until all had been placed, and then returned them at the end of the round. 

That rule seems pretty important, because without it the game struggles to differentiate itself from other entry-level worker placement games. Alright, I'll at least give credit to the connection mechanism which I thought was rather clever as it makes future moves more efficient. But the rest of the game is really average resource conversion fare – place a worker here, grab the corresponding resources – with the synthesis of more advanced resources involved (a la [thing=66188][/thing]'s secondary and tertiary colours). Also the 4P game seemed to drag a bit, but it may have just been a consequence of using the wrong worker placement rules.

Gameplay aside, the theme is cute and cheerful, but it is just a veneer for the usual 'the king demands so-and-so resources for VP' game. The board gets points for uniqueness, although having oddly-shaped locations all over the board strikes me as rather confusing, and the icons denoting each location don't help much either. Possibly decent entry-level worker placement game, but I think there are more exciting ones out there.

Relatively simple worker placement game - all the spaces are get-this or trade-this-for-that, and the few take-that elements are very straight forward. It's possible to improve your strategy after the first game or the 10th.

And the theme is great. It is reinforced by the mechanics in a couple of places (ship upgrades and space riffraf), and everywhere else it adds an appealing (and sometimes genuinely funny) goofiness.

Just meh for me. When this was kickstarted I thought it would be closer to Lords of Waterdeep in play, but there is no blocking of spaces. Bumping doesn't work as well as Euphoria. The trobil cards are the main way to get points, yet they are limited as the game timer, and tend to take more resource gathering to complete compared to quests in LoW. The riff-raff cards just cluttered the board with characters.

ORANGE! Right, now that's out of the way. Interesting take on worker placement, feel that I'd only bring it out with certain player numbers, otherwise the bumping mechanic can become a non-factor

Great light to medium worker placement game with a great bumping mechanism. Bumping bonus for a 2 player game is awesome! Keeps the full spirit of the game in the 2 player game. Colors of the game drew me in but there is a lot game too! Love it!!!

So far this is an excellent worker placement game.  The artwork is phenominal, the humor is great, and the game feels solid.  The only caviat I have is it can run a little long, but multiple plays should fix that since each turn is very fast and simple.  Connection cards that give you resources every time you visit a certain place mixed with bumping other workers off a space you need make this unique and filled with lots of interactivity and strategy.

RATING: 10
This is a great game!  It was quick to learn, there's little to remember as it's all on the cards and board, and, with limited options, it's VERY fast paced.  Even playing with the full 7 players, turns were very short and the game kept moving (but still took about 75 minutes).

The "no blocking" system is great and really keeps the game moving along because there's no need for Plans B and C or last minute changes due to your plan being spoiled (well, except when someone takes your Trobil).

I can't think of anything bad to say about this game, except, maybe, that it has a lot of pieces which take up a lot of space and make set up and tear down longer.

Update: I have now played it with 5 people and it is just as good.  Still very fast paced and very fun.

Rid Paradise of all Trobils. Worker placement with bumping and individual player bonuses. To some, this may be called 'the orange game'.

RATING: 5
It works well enough, but I am not generally fond of games where you just churn things - all you do in this game is pick up stuff, use it to get points, and go get more stuff. You can't improve your abilities except by getting more ships (which are useful but don't really change the dynamic) or by getting connections (which change the dynamic, but very little, and I'm not convinced getting several of these is worthwhile).

I am also less than thrilled with the way the city cards are revealed. Since you will have little time to plan for most and none at all for the last one, some of the scoring is very random.

Sci-fi worker placement to pickup and deliver resources to exterminate Trobils. Trap and lure them with space carrots, slugs and ore crystals. The twist to the game play is the use of connections that modify your resource gathering and the "bump" mechanic adds a different interactive component to selecting worker actions.  The third wild factor is the use of pirate cards that will force changing tactics and evolve strategy while managing your engine. Not sure how this scales to six players. Hiddden end game objectives for everyone is unusual and adds a luck factor to scoring. Decent think tension and could easily be a gateway. The connectors and bump action is a refreshing twist to classic worker placement. The art reminds me of Dr. Seuss.

RATING: 9
A fun worker placement game that is easy to teach, but still deep in strategy. The bumping mechanic works great and the fact that it doesn't punish the player being bumped is such a great take on that.

Being able to modify the worker spots by upgrading your ship is also very fun as it just makes the game different every time you play no matter what.

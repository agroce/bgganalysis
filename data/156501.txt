Dice rolling, story telling, punitive card draws...this game contains lots of mechanics that I usually despise, however, I'm drawn to this game and really enjoy it.

Negotiations as a way to mitigate dice places heavy emphasis on diplomacy, I could see this game being really nasty, stealing sheep, kidnapping daughters, ambushing hunting parties, etc. Lots of fun

My most played game last year. Loved it and should get back to it. Played solo, but running 2 or 3 factions to see who comes out on top. Story game. The solo mode on the other hand didn't do anything for me.
Allows for much more actual gameplay than Neanderthal.

This is a fascinating game for anyone with an interest in history and science. The definition of a "big", complex game in a tiny box. The rules are, perhaps, overly fiddly, and the rule book quite complicated. I love all of the references and endnotes explaining the historical and scientific basis for various things in the game. I do understand that this isn't for everyone. I wasn't a huge fan of the solo variant, but enjoyed the game with two players. I haven't played it with three players, but would imagine that things will get quite a lot more crowded and confrontational.

RATING: 5
Pretty much what's to be expected from a latter day Phil Eklund game.  The theme of a struggle for survival of hunting societies in a land whose climate is getting colder and where resources of all kinds are scarce is strongly evoked.  There is the clutter of text and icons.  And there is a big chunk of randomness, with dice rolled to resolve almost everything and a series of random events that can cause the loss of half your population or kill off key elders, repeatedly.  Ultimately, for me the randomness is too much.

Production quality and artwork are both decent.  The rules seem poorly organized, with too much cross-referencing.

Καρτοπαίχνιδο για 2-3 άτομα με περίεργο θέμα, την προσπάθεια επιβίωσης στην μακρινή Γροιλανδία στον Μεσαίωνα. Έχουμε λοιπόν την φυλή μας και τους στέλνουμε να μαζέψουν resources όπως περίπου το Stone Age. Ρίχνουμε ένα ζάρι για κάθε εργάτη και πρέπει να φέρουμε το κατάλληλο νούμερο. Επίσης μπορούμε να δώσουμε στους εργάτες μας αξιώματα όπως σαμάνος ή πολέμαρχος που μας προσφέρουν abilities αλλά δεν πάνε πλέον για να συλλέξουν resources.

Οι φυλές στο παιχνίδι διαφέρουν μεταξύ τους αφού κάθε φυλή έχει 3 κόρες με διαφορετικές ικανότητες. Υπάρχουν πολλοί μηχανισμοί όπως πλειστηριασμός για αγαθά από Ευρώπη, εκτροφή ζώων, αλλαγή θρησκεύματος και άλλα. Γενικά έχει πολύ πράμα στο μικρό αυτό κουτάκι αλλά τελικά δεν μου άφησε καλή εντύπωση όλο αυτό το τουρλουμπούκι μηχανισμών. Πολύ τύχη στο παιχνίδι και πολλά καταστροφικά events που σκάνε κάθε γύρα και σε ρημάζουν χωρίς να έχεις χρόνο να αντιδράσεις.

Ίσως με περισσότερα plays να στρώνει το παιχνίδι καθώς θα ξέρεις τι events υπάρχουν, αλλά προσωπικά δεν θα μπω στον κόπο.

RATING: 1
A dice-driven, convoluted, random, needlessly punishing, dry, abstract mess.  One of the worst "games" I have ever played.  It's basically just roll a die and hope to get a one or a two.  The cards and impenetrable rulebook are there to create the illusion of choice and narrative.  If anything, this "educational" game is actually anti-educational and anti-intellectual.  The designer is a good writer and researcher--I'd rather read a book or article by him than play one of his games.

More Eckland themey fun in a tiny box!  What I enjoy about his games and games like this is how they teach me about a subject I knew little-to-nothing about in the context of a game rich in choices and difficult decisions.  After a few solo plays, I understand the rules well and have seen that outcomes can vary widely (Norse had a strong win in one game, struggled just to survive in another).  There are a few rules questions being sorted out, so once those settle down I'll finalize my rating.

RATING: 7
More accessible than Pax Porfiriana, which I thought was a fantastic simulation and "magical history tour," but this one still suffers from a lack of what I call "flow," which affects replayability.

Still, Greenland is a great design and gaming experience. Lots of decisions, tension, excitement, and every game tells a story. Good with two players; haven't played with three.

RATING: 2
I was really excited to pick this game up, especially for solitaire play. The theme seemed interesting, and I'd heard a lot about its interesting decisions and challenging play. As it turns out, I hate this game. I hate almost everything about it. I liked the theme. I also liked the components (that isn't something I normally comment on, but I loved the plastic discs). However, this game is SO RANDOM. There are random event cards each round that you have no control over. There are rolls of the dice that, even when I play the odds correctly, never seem to go my way. I think some randomness is good in games, but this is just too much. However, I could forgive the randomness if it weren't for a the ridiculously complicated rules. That is what killed this game for me. I'd played it once and didn't love it. I decided to give it another try and the rules were such a headache I decided after 4 turns that I never wanted to play the game again, so I sold it.

:d10-3:
Oh, Phil Eklund. You have such interesting game mechanics, and you create such interesting systems that ask such interesting questions of the players. But your dogged adherence to thematic integration mars what could be a much better game.

Greenland feels like a large dose of Pax Porfiriana (asymmetrical starting powers, light engine building, multiple victory conditions, action cards that can be converted into victory points) and a small dose of Machi Koro (rolling for resources, cards that alter probability). Add in a strict 10-turn timeframe and you've got yourself Greenland.

Oh, wait. The thematic stuff. SO MUCH THEMATIC STUFF. I can't even get into all of it, but suffice to say that what could (should?) be a 60-minute light worker placement game becomes a bloated multi-hour slog. Sure, with more experience, it might get down to 30 minutes per player. But even then, the random events and the dice rolls are too much luck to suit my taste.

On top of all that, Greenland's graphic interface is - if you can believe it - worse than that of Pax Porfiriana.

If you love Pax Porfiriana, especially if you love the thematic integration, you owe it to yourself to try Greenland. Otherwise, I'd skip it.

Brutal game of judging the odds and eeking out survival. Fun, interesting game where you can enter a death spiral and flail and yet still have fun! or maybe that should be "fun".

tl;dr - a grown-up Stone Age, but one where the game hates you.

Brutal survival game. Very engaging engine and a bit of a roller coaster. One hand, you're running out of wooden tokens to use for the Hunt phase. The next turn, it seems your dwindling population will be destroyed by turn's end, only to rebound and eek out an existence the following turn.

Nice components, small footprint (box), and a fun tableau builder. The randomness of Hunt results, removal of event cards from the starting deck and high likelihood of not playing through all of the North/South cards keep the playability very high.

Would definitely recommend as a First Time Eklund Experience! Heck, it was my first Eklund game!

Edit: August 15 - after playtesting neanderthal, I find Greenland to be a bit static and dry. The variability of the little brother game really has me excited to see it in the final form. Bumped GL down a nudge as appropriate

This game is pretty brutal, but there are several things I like about it. For a game with an educational (or historical accuracy) agenda, it remains a fun experience. The difficulty of the game is also appealing, as well as the asymmetrical feel of each tribe.

A few negatives: the rule book is like reading a textbook; dry and laid out in a strange way. The graphic design is also lacking. Lots of iconography clutter up the cards and the art of said icons is pretty boring. There is also a sizable amount of luck (which I guess is true to the theme)

There are plenty of choices to be made here though, and a really solid and robust game inside that tiny (really... it's tiny) box.

Initial impressions positive; there's certainly an experiential game here in the constant struggle against the elements, but further plays required to be sure just how much more there's to it than that - to be fair, there's every indication that there a fair bit more but it's difficult to be sure after only one play. Plus it plays pretty quickly (very, very quickly for an Eklund game) and maybe even exceeds Pax for the amount of bangs per buck it squeezes into an even smaller box. Probably like nothing else you've ever tried if you haven't played an Eklund design before, and much faster if you have.  Recommended. 


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Although the gameplay isn't that much like Pax Porifiriana - more like a mishmash of Pax, Origins, and Bios plus a number of new ideas - the overall feel is somewhat similar. Pretty chaotic, you're trying to navigate a tough situation as best you can with lots of chances for things to go wrong and it not really be your fault. But still, I love it. Intensely  evocative of the fight for survival in Greenland in 1200-1600, with lots of different pressures and everyone always one bad set of events away from the cliff. With the right domestic animals, technology, and hunting grounds though, you can survive and even do well.

I also thought it was very cool that the only individuals represented in the game are women.

Phil Eklund and Sierra Madre has been on a tear of late and this is another real winner in their modern style. Fans of any of Pax Porfiriana, High Frontier, Bios: Megafauna, or Origins should find plenty to like here. A bit more control and nuance than Pax, less chaos than Bios, and obviously a lot faster-playing than Origins. 

The advertised 2hr play time is optimistic for your first run-through with 3p unless you are pretty quick (and if you skip the intro game as I did) - there is a lot to absorb here and there are actually a surprising number of directions you can try to talk your society. But like Pax, familiarity with the rules and an understanding of what the game is trying to do should very quickly bring the playtime down to a comfortable 90-120 min. The Survival game is very tempting; it seems like it would be brutal, but that also seems appropriate :)

Anyway, I love SMG's recent games and this seems like another winner.

I was a playtester and logged about 15 games of Greenland in for Phil.  

The game has come a long way, that is for sure.  I will have a lot to say about it once I play my beautifully produced final copy a few times. 

Update:
I recently had a chance to play this game again. I'm probably played the published game as much as the prototype now.  I like it, though it isn't my favorite Eklund. The game serves as a great entry into Eklundia, but it was a little light for my taste.  Still, this is probably the best entry point into his body of work.

An interesting game, but some will find it unsatisfying.  It is basically a game of managing crises, and for the most part, it is difficult to manage them well.  The game will relentlessly through obstacles to success at you while your opponents have the opportunity to further exploit and weaknesses.

At its heart, this is a game of engine destruction.  Those that like to build and have their economy snowball will be horrified.  It can be pretty brutal out there.  And those that abhor luck in their games better steer clear. You have been warned.

Those that want a game that really seems to model the futility of the struggle to survive in the arctic will be smitten.

Stellar 3p combat/survival game. Quick to play, not too difficult to teach (I found the rulebook solid and not tough like previous games), and very portable. But man, is this game ferocious and soul eating if you play it with competent players. This game requires repeat plays, it requires negotiation prowess and ability to plan and rationalise. The elegance and economy of this tiny game is amazing, there is so much to explore in such a small box.

Don't waste your time on solo games, although the solo game is a good distraction and learning tool. Don't worry if your first solo flops, it did for me too. Don't worry that there are very few cards in the game, compared to, say, Pax. Play this game with 2 wargamers or Age-of-Steamers, and see it shine brighter than a thousand blubber torches.

Highly recommended.

I was at a convention and had just finished playing a casual game with a few strangers. One of them asked me and another guy if we wanted to try this game he brought called "Greenland". We agreed to try it after being told it shouldn't take more than about 90 minutes. 45 minutes into explaining the rules it felt like a cruel joke since it would have been rude to back out at that point. It probably took another 2 hours to actually play the game. Neither me nor my unwitting friend enjoyed it and were both anxiously awaiting it to end about halfway through. While I appreciate Eklund's seeming passion for history and anthropology, this is my idea of horrible game design. It's overwrought, inelegant, cumbersome, overly complicated, trying to do too many things simply for the sake of realism, and just not very fun. Personally, I hated it and was one of the worst gaming experiences I've ever had, but I'm not rating it a 1 since I didn't know what I was getting into and Ecklund simply has a different goal when designing games than my reason for playing them. If I was interested in this type of game (simulation?), I would probably give it closer to a 5.

As a fan of High Frontier and Erosion and a huge fan of Pax Porfiriana, this was an auto-buy.

After one play (not counting the prototype), it's a solid 9 and seems likely to go higher. We played with three, all of us having read the rules but not played before. The balance of strategic thinking and stand-up dice moments (such as the Thule player making a desperate last-turn bid to convert my Norsemen and thus wipe out my whaling trophy-points) makes for a really fun, interesting experience. 

However, we were all conscious that there were so many elements of the game – particularly conflict, negotiation and the balance of power – where we barely scratched the surface. It's a hugely enjoyable game already and feels like it will get more and more so with repeated plays.

First play solo and a bit of a mixed bag - firstly, the rule book is a pig. Written in the style of using as few words to explain the rules as possible, everything is only mentioned once so you are always skipping forward and back to make sense of a paragraph. Then there are a fair few ambiguities though most of these are addressed in the rules forums and/or living rules. It took a play through video and two play-aid summaries before I was able to start. 

The game itself has some interesting elements and engages the theme pretty well. There is however a lot of dice - whether the luck element overwhelms the means you have to mitigate it needs judging from future plays when I have half an idea what I'm doing.

I so admire [thing=156501][/thing]: the historical detail, the deep theme, the way the game picks you up and spits you out, throwing disaster after disaster at you.  

This game splits many people in a way Phil Ecklund’s (the designer) other recent game, Pax Porfiriana, did not.  Why?   I think for three reasons.  
One is that the game is really tough on you and that is not always an easy experience to endure, it is not always enjoyable to see your populations decimated again and again.  
Then there are the dice.  This is a dice game.  There is a lot of dice rolling and the averages will even out over a game, but you can be destroyed by a bad dice roll at the wrong moment.  
And finally the game takes no prisoners:  you can effectively be out of the game really early on and just be scraping by with no chance of winning.  

But I think to counter those arguments you have to just go with the flow with Greenland, and run with the experience, forget the winning.  It’s the same with Pax Porfiriana in that respect, the thematic resonance is so strong that winning seems second to the actual immersion.

RATING: 7
A rather anti euro. Assign your hunters to rather risky hunts, raids, or resource gathering exercises, roll 1s or 2s. If you roll 3s and sometimes 4s they can die. Earn new hunters and resources and sometimes victory points. Chaotic as it comes and essentially a strategy in risk management but as with all Eklund games the narrative is unparalleled. This is a game that brings you into its story and makes you feel the approaching doom. Solid game as long as that lasts.

Greenland, what a hoot. I had a severe case of beginner's luck with the Thule, and even though Jeff and his Norsemen had a good plan to forcibly convert my people to Christianity from polytheism (which would render all my animal VP trophies worthless!), a funny thing happened along the way in that his New World colony turned hostile. Very hostile. And then his people had a bloody feud. He was suddenly left with very few people and had to go about rebuilding his army but there wasn't enough game left. Jon as the Tunit was relying on me and Jeff beating each other up which didn't happen. He realized too late he should've gone the monotheistic way as he couldn't keep up with my people's hunting abilities. 

In the end, I scored probably more points than will ever be scored in that game (53) and it was over before it was over. I had good dice modifiers plus some good luck and rolled quadruples (whale!) and triples (shark!) plus a lot of doubles (other things I killed!), which you need to claim trophies. My people hunted to extinction the Bowhead Whale and the Greenland Shark which is why you never hear about them anymore.

It's an interesting game. I'd play again, but I can't say I find it as compelling as Pax Porf. My friend called it "Phil Eklund's take on Elder Sign or Stone Age" which sounds about right. It's a thematic and historically accurate dice strategy game where you can have a near perfect game like I did or have your game go off the rails like Jeff's. As long as you're OK being on either end of that ride, you should be fine here.

Tough game of survival between the Thule, Tunit and Norse as rival communities in Greenland.  The game itself extracts quite a toll due to hunter and elder attrition as the climate gets colder and the prey fights back.  Thematically rich.  Main mechanisms are card acquisition by hunting which involves rolling a die for every hunter involved in the hunt. Luck can be mitigated as acquiring abilities to modify the dice is a key element of the game.

I like this Phil Eklund game, but have a hard time groking how the mainland locations work.  This sees some play in the cooler months, but the rules are a little difficult.  We do love High Frontier, Bios: MegaFauna and Genesis, and Neanderthal are all amazing, so we aren't scared off by rules complexity of SMJ games, but this one just did not click for me.

Greenland is, like other Eklund games, a ride in which you don't know where it will take you. You're never quite sure if the marginal advantage you've carved out will be whitled away by the game structure itself or your colluding opponents. Furthermore, Greenland has to be the most accessible Eklund game available on the market yet. Bar none. While this doesn't necessarily mean that it is easy to explain or unpack, it's certainly within range for mid-to-heavy euro players. I enjoyed the game, but I'm not sure how much of the enjoyment was from enjoying it as a system to game. I'm looking forward to playing more to find out.

10 Play Challenge: 9 more needed

My initial thoughts on this game: I was extremely excited to play this after a read through of the rules and having watched a few video tutorials.  Thematically it delivers in spades!  Explanation of the game was a little bit of a bear but it is extremely intuitive in both process and symbology once you are moving along.  

My gaming partners didn't enjoy their experience as much as I, partly due to some of the asymmetric and random elements of the game.  I thought it was brilliantly executed like a good novel - it told the story of three people groups trying to survive and finding themselves at loss and conflict constantly.  

I am not sure who will enjoy this game with me - its too random to appeal to euro players, to obscurely thematic and the production is unique that it won't appeal to ameritrash players... I hope to play further games of this because I thought it was mechanically sound, narrative-driven, and really quite openly fun - the potential is high in this game to explore its boundaries if you can find them.

Started out with a shaggy pony, then got dogs.  We hunted whale.  [i]We hunted whale.[/i]

The narwhal breached the ice and ironically speared Ugalik clean through the chest.  He dropped his own harpoon and hacked at the great beast's tooth with his meteorite ax as he was lifted into the air and rotated suddenly legs-up and wriggling, then slapped into the black, killing water.  The whale dismissed us with a wave of flukes and the sting of icy spray.  And so we had no meat or blubber but Aulanurk had her choice of husbands that season.

Like all Eklund games, this is one's a quirky girlfriend—deep, but not straight up-and-down, nearly unfathomable, unique, unforgettable, haunting.  And here she's whipping up a human experience milkshake out of overfull scoops of

Know that you'll play this the first couple-five times [i]all wrong[/i] and just go for it—the experience is the thing, and every play gets better and better.

Oh, and if you can't tell from the first two paragraphs above, the thing bleeds stories that beg to be told—like the time the Thule and Tunit suckered the ill-prepared Norse into hunting orca.  That was a hilariously Bad Day.

Second Edition:

+ Oversized Elder placards instead of playing cards!

- [size=5]Micro-tiny text on Elder placards.[/size]
- New art.
- Rules tweaks...

The new art is more than sufficient—well-done and entirely consistent—it's just that it has 100% less personality and charm than the First Edition.  The overall feeling is generic and sterile, a stark contrast to the previous version's vividly organic cards.  It's the difference between flipping through an illustrated book and walking through a museum exhibit—the previous version was far more evocative and "alive".*  

[size=7]*Phil's "kit-bashed" card art is almost always shocking upon first contact, but there's a kind of deep symmetry to it, an overarching and unifying ethos that gives the rest of us benighted mortals a glimpse into his brilliant mind.  At first it looks like chaos, but as you play you see that it actually works—then it begins to grow on you, and when you finally "get it" your IQ goes up like fifteen points.[/size]

So, tiny changes in the rules between editions, [i]yeah[/i].  

Phil loves to tinker and I'm not sure he ever truly abandons a game, especially when you can publish changes ad infinitum on the Internet and then rescind them the moment it turns out they don't actually work that well.  (Reference the [i]High Frontier[/i] rules merry-go-round.)  Given that his rulebooks read like one Phil Eklund sharing his notes with a nodding clone of Phil Eklund, this rules churn is especially annoying when it takes several plays to finally get them down, only to see they've changed [i]again[/i]—and the natural inclination is to assume that any change made by the designer is a critical one, fixing something that's not quite right, when in reality it's just noodling for noodling's sake.

The key is to pick a version of the rules and stick with it—like we finally ended up doing for [i]High Frontier[/i]—so your friends don't kill you because every session is tweaked and feels like yet another learning game.  Or an extended playtest.

Regardless, if you're at all intrigued you should try this—it's the one of the best 3-player games I own.

As my experience is with a two player game, I can't say much about asymmetric objectives and semi-interaction among all tribes. The game itself was a great lesson about Greenland history, the tribes lived there. Speaking of mechanics - I didn't like that much the luck factor that is behind dice rolls. Yeah, I understand the authors opinion that every situation in real life can be simulated with a particular game-mechanic and probabilities. Nevertheless I doubt Greenland native tribes were calculating probabilities of their chances to hunt a Whale or find an Iron. And as leaders of our tribes we were forced to evaluate our options through the probability aspect all game long and that was ruining the feeling a lot...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I don't know if this is a game, per se. It seems more like an experience that you and other players all share while groaning at your own and other's misfortune. With that understood, it can be a lot of fun. The information on the cards is fascinating, and I learned a lot about part of my own country that I know very little about.

As a game, meh. It's HEAVILY dice driven, and while you can equalize some of the chance over the course of the game, you can also lose based off one bad hunt roll. The constant tinkering with the rules is also kind of annoying. I am sure I'm not alone in wanting to play the most complete vision of a designer, but trying to sort out how exactly my game can be played according to the newest rules was a PITA.

In short, fun, but not a hall of famer.

Sleeved in Mayday standards.

Greenland offers a tense, unforgiving gaming experience. Leading your tribe and managing your resources takes careful, precise planning, all of which hangs on the fate of how the dice roll. The learning curve is steep (mainly in the icons), and the scoring seems anticlimactic. While the design is impressive, the amount of mental work required doesn't pay off with enough fun to make this a​ game I would want to play often.

Greenland is about survival on a tribal level. Like all of Eklund's designs this one is exploding in subject specific details from hunting/gathering, animal domestication and migration, climate shifts, raids, colonization, technological advances, births, elders, religion, proselytizing, and witch-burning. In many ways it reminds me of Origins in the breadth of topics it wishes to touch upon albeit within a smaller scope. Likewise, it has environmental and animal elements reminiscent of Bios Megafauana. And all of this in a 60min, tiny boxed, well-researched package. 

WARNING: Like all Eklund's, please do not approach this like a standard, abstract euro exercise, placing cubes and rolling for iron, ivory, and trophy VPs. Such play sucks all the life and narrative right out of the game and you will be disappointed.

[b]My thoughts on Greenland[/b]
Greenland is a game for 1-3 players in which you try to be the dominant Greenland tribe in the 15th and 16th century. You are pitted against the other tribes but also against the harsh climate and the dangerous predators that you try to hunt for food and energy.
I played the solo game only once so far. It is a good way to learn the mechanics of the game, which seem a bit daunting at first but are actually fairly simple once you try a few rounds. However, the survival mode is very repetitive and boring. I can see this as a very interesting two or three player game, though, as both negotiation and raiding will actually become an important part of the game.

3rd edition of the game being announced discouraged me from keeping this game. Do it right the first time. Greenland and neanderthal are so similar, but neanderthal is just far superior.

Pax Pamir is my favorite game for the moment, so I have big hopes for this one. It looks to be a pretty solid solo game as well.
...
(Update 160505) Interesting dice game. It's a bit fiddly though, partially because the rule book would need a simpler layout.

The dynamics between special abilities of the tribes and winning conditions makes it a rewarding experience. A "timely" event card, especially in the last turns, can save or destroy your chances.
...
(Update 170403) Nice quick flow as 2-player game as well, even though it feels like 3 players would be better. An interesting scenario played out when I because of tough decimation decided to convert to monotheism, something that feels like a lock down, while my opponent didn't and didn't have resources to force him either. My lead was about 20 points before the last event card, but was cut to only 4 points when the game ended. It seems to prove that there's a lot of opportunities in the game Greenland, and as long as you don't play as a fool you will likely find something that helps you to bounce back.
...
(Update 170514) A 3-player game proved to be even better. Negotiations makes more sense. Really good thinky "party" game.

A3 Negotiate/Attack Order
The player with the most iron determines the order of negotiations among cards containing cubes of different players. Unless all but one player’s hunters leave a card, all players must immediately attack (F2), starting with the player with the most iron.
War Party forms with level 4 elder and is successful with 1s or 2s for warm side biomes.
For purposes of attack, listed biome is ignored. Treat biome as a raid for purposes of modifiers.

A4 Hunt Order
The first player decides which card is hunted first, second, etc.
Least Hunter Order (excepting card modifications)

A5 Elder Action Order
All polytheists go first (in player order per A2), then all monotheists (also in player order).

F4 Iron Rule
If you have suffered losses during either an opponent’s Attack Roll or during your Hunt Roll, right after that roll you may expend one iron disk to cancel your losses.

G3 Modifications > non-optional

G5 Optional. You may claim card 9A (Cape York Meteorite) as a trophy if you roll doubles in the Hunt Roll and have sled technology.

I really enjoyed my one play of Phil Eklund's Neanderthal last year, enough that when a pal was clearing out some games, I picked up his copy. Pal Matt got Greenland from the same source.

Greenland is very much like Neanderthal, with a lot of similar mechanisms. That's good, because I enjoyed them in the former game. However, as eager as I am to play my copy of Neanderthal, I think I might lean towards Greenland more out of the two designs. I like them both, but Greenland doesn't have the weirdo build-a-brain stuff and just makes more narrative sense, an important quality in trying to parse Eklund rules. 

As is often the case, we were kind of flailing around with this at first, but I think for the second half of the game we at least had a handle on what we were doing, if not whether or not it was the right thing to do. There were moments of triumph and tragedy, trash talking, and slap fighting, like a good game. I dug it.

Rating based on solo play only. Too many elements of the game missing when playing solo. Felt underwhelming. Have still to try it with the Frozen Valhalla unofficial solo variant. Am hopeful it will bring it to life.

EDIT: I recently got this one out again and tried to start a game with the Valhalla variant (which looks promising). I'd forgotten all the official rules, so was back to square one. I didn't get any further than the first turn as I twisted my brain in various contortions trying to work out what the rules manual was trying to tell me, whilst referring to the 'living rules' (a lazy excuse for just not putting a game through the wringer from the beginning and making sure you end up with a finished product to offer people) trying to weed out all the errata, and transfer it all to my old 1st edition. I gave up...for now. It's bugging me because I feel like it's one of those games that is FAR less complicated than it appears (I had similar issues with Zulus on the Ramparts, but this is that ten-fold). It's feels like Eklund unleashed his stream of consciousness upon the rule book and didn't bother to tidy things up afterwards. I guess that Mr Eklund's games are so niche that no mainstream publisher would take them on board which is a shame as, with more work on the presentation, Greenland could rise in a lot of people's estimations. For now, from an educational standpoint Greenland is very intriguing, but as a game? Is it worth the effort? I don't know, but apparently I keep trying...

To end on a positive note; the other thing people seem to kick the game for is the amount of dice rolling going on. This bit, I'm pleased to say, doesn't bother me one bit. In fact I feel the opposite; the harsh environment throws unpredictable situations at you and the dice reflect that well.

First impression after one 2p game.  Having played this after Neanderthal, and being more familiar with Neanderthal, I could not help but compare the two.  Greenland is a fine game in itself, and captures the desolate feeling of what it simulates.  It lacks the excitement and interaction of the auction for daughters in Neanderthal.  It also lacks the communication problems of the verbal tribes in Neanderthal and the factions are more asymmetrical and set in stone.  I will need to play it again as intended, with three players, all the correct rules (the first time with an Eklund game always has some mistakes) and more direct confrontation/interaction/negotiation before I can pass final judgment.  I am intrigued, but wonder if I wouldn't rather focus on one game of which I master the rules rather than alternate between two games of which I am bound to always forget some rules.

Such a good game. By far the biggest game in the smallest box I have played. It is not a civ game in that you are building yourself up, it is a survival game where finishing alive can be an accomplishment in itself. Really well thought out and well made game. Strong recommend to anyone who enjoys the fight for survival. Tough and meaty.

3.1 Collected Essen 2014 collection. £19.17. Awful rulebook, too complicated. Not fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After a solo "test" game. The rules are intimidating, but after a while you can get the idea of the game. There are a lot of small rules easy to forget. I'm eager to play this with more people (Rat = 7.5).

Edit After a 2nd solo I think that I'm understanding what is going on and some of the possibilities that this game offers(there are too many, Rat = 8)

Edit: my feelings about this game were a mixture between what I felt for Pax Porfiriana and Rallyman. Excellent theme, nice mechanics, however I only played it as solitaire because it was almost imposible to teach to other people (classic Ecklund). When played solitaire I did not wanted to finish the game...(same as rallyman for me)...Sold

RATING: 7
My first Phil Eklundgame. I have mainly played it solo and only once with another player.

I feel I have played out the solo game so it has sat on the shelf for a while. The solo game is good but the swingy-ness of the game via dice rolls and constant need to be aggressive towards other players in order to survive could push me away from playing it multiplayer too often. I don't mind confrontation in games, in fact I enjoy it, but in this one the results of some confrontations could be resolved on a single die role and that I am not so keen on. Especially when the consequences on the rest of your game are major.

The solo game is a great way of learning the game but I feel its slightly lacking compared to other solo games I play. Greenland I feel would come into its own during the 3 player game. This I haven't tried yet so I do have that to look forward to. 

I did really enjoy the game, and there is a lot of game in its small box. But I have since got Neanderthal, and if I feel that plays better for me I am not sure I will keep both of them.

Another eklundian Masterpiece. Amazing rollercoaster-like gameplay. But - not for the faint of the heart. You have to live with the die rolls, and these can be devastating. If you can live with that be ready for a deep-freezing experience and a story that emerges around the Events and the Decision you make out of that. How long will you survive? In comparison to his other Titles this plays in the same league as Neanderthal. IMHO the Bios titles are even better - but this is my preference for biological topics.

Always exciting and always telling a story. Like the one time one of my friends crashed a peaceful wedding at a baby seal colony. He arrived in a musk ox sleigh and forced some of the wedding guests to marry his tribesmen - otherwise he would cancel the wedding.

Edit: wow, just received a copy of the second ed., which I was not expecting. It's from an online order from the first edition that I thought I had canceled when I found a copy elsewhere. I'm actually glad to receive it, since it's apparently almost sold out (again), and I realy do like the new art. (I liked the 1st ed art just fine, too) Kudos, SMG. 

I now have played one real three player game, and some solo games. Fascinating design that is true to the history and also chaotic and fun as a game. Really feels like an Eklund design, but is a pretty approachable one. Does not have quite the crazy personality of Pax Porfiriana, which is hardly an insult. It is amazing what is done with 60 odd cards here.

My more casual gamer friends seemed to like their first play, and want to play more.

Basically an economic/ history/ conflict sim, like other Eklund designs. And this time with lots of dice. And the rules are very well laid out and clear this time. I had a couple of minor questions, but most things are in the rules.

May raise this to a 10. That is my score for Pax Porfiriana, and it richly deserves it, but this one is definitely less intimidating for new players. It still has a lot of stuff going on, which is a big plus, in my book.

Based on limited information, mostly geekbuddy comments, I think that having Pax Porfiriana will be enough for me. Also not too pleased about there being a second edition with different art and an expansion. I think that smaller games should preferably be complete from the start and not be modified or extended.

Update:
Bought it not too much later. Of course, I did not play it yet. (But managed to mark all the cards by dipping the deck into a drop of olive oil.)

For a Phil Eklund game this is surprisingly "simple"! I liked the theme and the game played ok, but maybe it seemed pretty luck oriented, since most of the important stuff works through throwing the dice. Sure, you can try to even the odds by adding dice or buying stuff, but I don't know... but I'd need at least a few more games to make up my mind. 

I can get the idea of adding truckloads of flavor text and anthropological/historical facts and so on, but at the same time it makes the cards look a bit crowded and busy. I think the booksy visual style worked better in the already tech-heavy theme of High Frontier, but it's not a huge issue in Greenland, really.

Great game, more of a simulation than your standard Euro-game. The rulebook can be daunting at first, but it is really easy to navigate, and retrieving specific rules is a breeze thanks to the coded paragraphs. Love the notes, interesting and informative, and love the references to Julian Jayne's "The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind" – in fact, the only thing that the rulebook lacks is a bibliography. Well, that and better components – I upgraded my copy with wooden discs and white-blue dice matched to the arctic theme.

Some people like Phil's games.  I don't.  I've tried some of them in the past and hated them.  For me, they are not really games.  So, it was no surprise that I didn't like this one.

His games seem to be more simulations, and I knew that going into the game, but the graphic design on the cards and the dice-rolling mechanics for me went out of fashion 30 years ago.  Way too random.  Random dice, random events, and way too long.

I send some cubes onto a space, and then roll dice to see if I succeed or not.  Yeah, no surprise I wasn't going to like it.

The game offers the usual Ecklund dilemma - great and interesting theming being offset by a horrible rule set and complicated iconology. This makes for a high barrier to entry (for a card game). I did warm up to the game (ahem) as the rounds went on and the cards were more consistently able to be interpreted without going to the rules-well. It turns out to be quite a vicious little affair, even if you play peaceably. Which I'm sure is suitably thematic. You require people to make babies. If you don't have people due to unfortunate die rolling and/or unscupulous gamers undermining your efforts, and can't make babies, game over. There's no catchup or get-back-in-the-game mechanisms. The rating might improve with more play, but I'm not sure the investment required from all the players to first simply understand how to play ok, and then how to play well, will be worth the effort due to the volatility of the card effects.

Only played one game so this is just initial impressions.

This played like a typical Eklund game for me. It was a roller-coaster ride, where we saw populations of the three tribes go from small groups of people to large colonies, only to be decimated by disease, the weather and our prey. I think it is slightly less complex than Bios Megafauna, and having played that a number of times, I felt we were able to transfer across to Greenland quite easily. There was less interaction in this game, but it was our first, so I think people will become more confrontational the more they play.

Due to the event cards, there is a natural progression during the game where Greenland slowly freezes over. The speed of this is totally dependent on which events you pull each game so I can see this effecting the end scores considerably. One of the biggest challenges is just to survive this harsh landscape, during this game all three of us came close to extinction. This coupled with the dice rolling for hunting makes a big part of the game about pushing your luck as far as you think you can. There are usually one or two biomes with easy prey that guarantee a new generation of hunters, but is that enough? Would it be better to go all out and take on an Orca that could take out half of you hunters? These are the sorts of questions you'll have to answer while playing this game.

Great fun, if a little harsh on the players at times.

Greenland is a 3-player card game in which players take on the role of a tribe trying to survive the harsh realities of living in Greenland during a period of global cooling. Like other Eklund designs, Greenland is longish, rules-heavy, and luck-dependent, favoring historical accuracy over streamlined gameplay. Each turn, players send out their hunter cubes to a number of animal and other cards and attempt to get one or more successful rolls (usually a 1 or 2) to gain the card’s reward. Cards often have two levels of reward, granting more cubes or resource tokens for a smaller number of successful rolls, and letting the player take the card itself for a larger number of successful rolls, which can grant a permanent bonus (often die manipulation) and/or end-game victory points. However, animal cards can also have “bite dice” icons, meaning any hunter that rolls that result is killed and returned to the supply. Multiple players can attempt to hunt the same animal card, but must either negotiate or fight over who actually will get to hunt the animal. Additionally, opponents’ claimed cards can be raided to steal them from that player. Personally, the luck inherent in this game bothered me, as often entire turns resulted in complete failure. I guess that might be thematic, but it wasn’t particularly fun. I also didn’t like the confrontational aspects of this game.

A relatively simple game that has a TON of little chrome sprinkled throughout. I actually really enjoyed this game even with how brutal and random the game can be. Rolling triples though to claim a trophy is just so awesome. Only to have it taken away from you by being forceably converted into monotheism. :)

I do still have a few questions about the rules and the only way to keep this game fresh in my mind is by playing it very shortly after. Too many little nuances to forget by putting it away for a few weeks at a time.

I've only played this 2/3 players as I find the solo rules lacking. I think 2 is solid, but I think 3 is where it's at. I need to try 2 again and see if I still feel like that.

Of the games in my collection, this is the one I am most excited to try to learn and play.

Scored:  A dice game designed by a mad scientist.  The game is rich with theme, nuance, a bewildering rule set which frankly needs to be seen to be appreciated.  While undoubtedly a brilliantly realized game, it is, at its heart, primarily a dice roll off.  You can mitigate the randomness somewhat with careful and deliberate play, but the dice still dictate the winner for the most part.  Take that for what you will.

Pax Porfiriana has become one of my top 5 games over 50+ plays in the last two years. So this new Eklund game has been long-awaited for me. I've got to play three times so far, which is still pretty early to assess a game as thematically and mechanically dense as Eklund's tend to be. My initial take is that I really enjoy it, but that it won't be as much of a favourite as Pax. 

Pax achieved the remarkable feat of offering a lot both to players who want to immerse themselves in theme and narrative and to players who care more about mechanics and competition. I think Greenland offers just as much to the former group, but less to the latter. There's a lot of game-driven chaos and each of my games has had a runaway loser. The time it was me was still an enjoyable experience though - I just had to shift my mindset to regarding it as a challenge to survive the 10 rounds rather than to win. However I can definitely see players who enjoy games more for competition and less for experience finding this off-putting.

Another Eklund flop - he's really hit or miss with me, and honestly I'm not sure I want to bear through his bad ones to find the gems.  Game-wise, this game has so many design missteps. The dice rolling is super-boring and time consuming - you can literally eliminate yourself from the game by rolling really unlucky and killing off all your hunters (which might be a good things, so you don't have to sit through 10 interminable events) but more likely is you can get really low on hunters from somewhat unlucky rolls and random events and then it's very slow going to grow your population back up (since you need a sizable population to have a chance at the cards that will keep your population growing at a good clip).  It's kind of an El Grande-like cube flow/area majority with dice, but without all the good design aspects of those Euros that make them fun - Eklund just seems to design in a vacuum.  Thematically, there is some immersion here, but honestly it just doesn't teach you much history at all about the Norse, Thule, and Dorset peoples at that time.  Flavor text amid randomized cards and random events doesn't teach history. And there's misinformation - syphilis!? No evidence the Inuit or Dorset carried this disease or that Norwegians contracted it. Much more likely the Norwegians gave small pox and other Old World diseases to the native peoples.   Raids and intermarriage between the peoples?! There may have been some conflict between Thule and Dorset - no evidence for or against - but genetically there is no evidence of any interbreeding between these 3 peoples.  Make a good game or something that really teaches the history, or ideally do both, but don't make a bad game with the guise of being very true to the theme and then teach misinformation.

I cannot comprehend why Phil Eklund doesn't hire a proper rules editor and continues to give us the worst rulebooks in gaming. Such rulebooks have caused me to steer away from his games, which is a damn shame since they are soo f*****ng interesting and unique. Another thing that I don't like is that the games aren't streamlined and the millin different little rules need to be checked comstantly.

A clever game with an immersive theme. Plays with two, but is better with three players. The randomness of the dice can be off-putting. Hunting the whale cards possibly brings too many VPs and makes them into game-breaking cards.

It’s an Eklund! At its heart, a simple dice-chucker, that combines luck management, random events, asymmetric factions, and is as much a pocket socio-historical model as a mere “game”. Weird in spades, I love it. Great solo, because it plays itself, great for 3 players who can dig the Eklund vibe.

About ten plays in now and I'm still not so sure if I'm impressed or quite the reverse. Lots of gambling with dice. Gamble to get cards to improve your future gambling odds. Then shake your head how you can roll rubbish anyway. Gamble on not getting venereal disease and then see syphilis strike half your hunters down (except the actual husbands - go figure?). Marriage just aint worth it. Upon the first couple of plays there's so much gambling and so much random death that decisions seem unimportant. You think you really can't plan for the next random decimation anyway. (I'm also not keen on this modern usage of the word "decimate" - especially when we're rounding up.) After a couple of outings though you've seen the events and you've got a much better idea what will befall you out of the 10 of 16 chosen tortures. (They're not so much events as bad news wrapped up hopefully with a tool.) So you know it'll be risky to carry 8-10 or more unassigned hunters into the next round. You know you don't want to marry into that Norse family until they've already had their syphilis outbreak. You know you're going to need a plentiful supply of dry wood. Ah! It all begins to click. The rules seem less fiddly than they once were. The modifiers are burnt into your brain. You have goals and aspirations. Dare I say you may even have formulated a cunning plan. So yes, the game is fun. The only problem I'm having is finding opponents willing to ride the learning curve to fun. When I suggest the game all I get is an icy, cold stare.

I found the rules super hard to wrap my head around (with so much page turning), only to discover the game isn't really as complicated as the first couple of turns make it out to be. So the result is that I'm even more annoyed with the rules putting me through the torture they did. All the little quirks and exceptions make the game well themed, but it's overblown here and it detracts from the enjoyment. Am I meant to be enjoying this though? Hmm, I wonder.

It really all comes down to the dice. Lovely theme. Interesting planning. Dice pain. Once you know the rules a two player game is over in 60-90 minutes. I want to play. I want a t-shirt saying I survived learning the rules, so I should make the most of it. I suppose. I think I'm in the minority here, but I really prefer the art in the original edition. More distinctive and less cartoony.

In its nifty little box, this may be the game in my collection offering the highest richness per unit of volume (except, that is, for its cognate Pax Porfiiriana, by Eklund as well, that tells a richer story through a more varied and tenser gameplay).

On the down side, the Vinland/monotheistic strategy seems to be dominant, and the emphasis on scant resources and survival ends up making for a somewhat "sparse" gameplay. The solitaire variant is uninteresting too. Still, a lot of respect for the simulation value.

There is a right way to approach a Phil Eklund game and a wrong way. The wrong way is to expect a game in which your actions determine the outcome. Often they don't. Eklund recreates a piece of the world in his games. The world can be an arbitrary place. This is especially true of Greenland between the 11th and 15th centuries. You have to know that going in. But go in with that expectation, understand that you won't be playing the game over and over again, and there might be a lot to pique your interest. [i]Interest[/i] is the key word; [i]fun[/i] is almost beside the point. However, it's surprisingly and comparatively simple to learn for an Eklund.

First game and really just kicking tires and turning the engine over. By the time to consider Vps it was too late to make any meaningful decisions.

It's fairly luck-based, but there are still interesting decisions, and the theme is very strong. The game is odd in that, early on, you have so many options that it can feel overwhelming, and in the end-game you have so few options that you don't have anything interesting to do.

I'm not a fan of dice rolling games unless they offer some other distraction to keep me interested. Usually this comes in the form of the meta game in plainly silly games like KoT or Quarriors. I think this is an equally silly game in that any combination of unlucky events can ruin your time but I don't mind that since the survival theme and the ability to be as comptetive or cooperative as you'd like means that I don't feel emotionally invested by default.  That's not to say there isn't good strategic play to be had here but as Eklund games go this is filler territory, and I think it is fantastic direction for him.

A lot of game in a little box, but there's just too much luck in this game for my taste.  It's a clever design, but given the rules overhead (moderate) and length of time to play, too much comes down to luck of the dice.

Chalk this up in the "it's not you, it's me" category, I suppose.

Like many Phil Eklund games, Greenland can vary massively from play to play. Often, it can seem as though the game is out to punish players and will almost never do anything to help you back in to it. If that happens early enough then you may as well stop playing. Which is a shame, as otherwise there is a lot to like in what is a complicated push your luck game with combat, resource collection and disaster management. 

I think that if Pax Po hadn't come out before, people would be less forgiving of this. Myself included.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Note: My feelings are based on the second edition solo variant (and not positive enough for me to teach to others.)
Phil Eklund certainly arranges a multi-pronged dice game with Greenland, and the rule book was clear on most points, but the experience was not immersive at all for me or even engaging.  It is more complex than Tiny Epic Galaxies, which is the only other lil dice game like this that I've played, but the objectives in that game are more compelling as the elements ratchet tighter with every turn.  Instead of escalating tension, Greenland alternates cycles of "bad stuff happens" and "deal with it."  Victories and defeats left me cold, and by the end of my first game, I just wanted to finish things up.  There is a different thought process in this game for sure, and I am going to investigate the far more complicated Eklund game High Frontier and hope that the complex format better serves this designer.  Overall, this game felt like  accounting, albeit superficially thematic accounting.

Finally gave in, because it is a card-and-dice game with lots of depth and has a good standing as a solo game. Probably will be the only way I get to play it. But I am allways tempted by game themes running on science. First play showed that it brings out the theme quite well (except the migratory rock, that was a bit weird). Quite tense fun as a solo game.

RATING: 6.5
[Started by playing] a 3p beginner's game, which removes some systems (intermarriage, combat, concept of cards in hand, colonies in Canada). This is then a game foremost about rolling dice to try to hunt (or mine), and buying/arranging for options that improve your odds.

The game's event deck is constantly working to kill your people off. A nice but startling abstraction is that instead of hunting in order to "feed your people," hunting directly gives you new people. It can also give ivory (used for bidding on items from foreign traders), iron (which has few uses in the beginner game aside from being VPs for monotheists), and energy (which represents firewood and labor and is what you pay to perform actions). If you roll well enough when hunting, you can also hunt a "biome" to extinction for VPs, but they will only be worth something if you're polytheistic at game end.

The most common player interaction comes when two players try to hunt on the same card. Whoever sends the weakest force gets to attempt the hunt first, and if successful no one else gets anything. In effect this is similar to an auction, with the prize (possibly) going to whoever will accept the worst odds.

Many cards are locations for cubes, as in Pax Porfiriana. What superficially resembles the card market of that game is here a selection of biomes in which to hunt or mine. These cards are either in northern or southern Greenland (i.e. two rows of cards), with the Inuit and Tunit being native to the former, and the Norse to the latter, so that mariner elders are required to transport hunters to the other half. Two Canadian colonies, Vinland and Markland, are also separate.

The events each turn not only kill off people but gradually alter which animals are available to be hunted, and gradually shift cards from warm to cold (where it is harder to hunt) to deep freeze (where the card leaves the game entirely).

There's an interesting depiction of religious conversion. All players start polytheistic (even the Norse); they can voluntarily become monotheistic, but only when all of their "elders" are dead. Elders confer valuable abilities and cost energy to deliberately kill off. The idea of converting initially sounds very unappealing.

The reasons to be of one persuasion or the other are fairly gamey. The VP measure is different, creating the tactic of becoming monotheistic in order to try to convert a polytheistic player (in the lead) to monotheism so that his "trophies" (what he gets for hunting animals to extinction) become valueless. Monotheists lose some abilities that they had as polytheists. It does make sense to me that two monotheistic players are able to establish a relationship that gives them both some points: Presumably all the monotheistic cultures have become Christian.

Overall I've so far gotten a similar feeling to Pax Porfiriana. Greenland is more random but the take-that interaction is possibly less harsh (due to not being as easy to pull off). Pax is probably strategically deeper.

What draws me to these games is the desire to see how Eklund will cram a large number of thematic systems and details into a game which (in this case) has only 60 cards. As strategy games they strike me as weak, but that's not supposed to be the point.

...Played a full game, which actually went down in about the same way as the first: Tunit luck into a bunch of trophies, Norse are beat down to the point that it makes sense to convert to monotheism, and then they try and fail to convert the Tunit. Tunit win by a mile.

The auctions seem weird. There aren't that many and the prizes rarely seemed desirable.

The Tunit's Markland colony seems weird. Those colonists are off in their own world, except that they mail home more firewood than the Tunit can possibly use. The Tunit don't even have to pay firewood to promote hunters to elders. Are they supposed to use it to buy stuff from the other players?

Crowding disease is a rather maddening catch-up mechanic. Get ahead in population and you're bound to lose half of them, unless you send the excess to Canada, where there are no diseases or feuds.

I have the hunch that raiding other players hardly ever makes sense to do, unless maybe if Greenland has become so cold that there's nothing to hunt but other people's domesticated animals.

RATING: 8
One must be willing to brave the dice & enjoy the experience. While you can drive a win, it's not just the other players that may deny you, so bring a sense of humor. And maybe a photo of Greenland to remind you of the bare, austere landscape simulated.

After Pax, which is a masterpiece, my expectations were high. I'm glad to see it isn't Pax-reimagined, with a very different set of mechanics but bringing forward that same compact, card-based tableau. This is a unique gem that will likely need some Ecklund in your DNA to appreciate, unlike Pax's very broad appeal.

Greenland matches Pax's thematic density & it's exuberance, and though the gamescape holds less card variety & lacks it's nimble economy, this serves Greenland well as deck familiarity & some foreknowledge of what's coming is needed to survive the cataclysms. The dynamics provide plenty of story & shenanigans, and things like individuated women as the cultural transmission for tribal knowledge & the importance of tribal elders is a nice break from juvenile fantasy fulfillment.

The theme leads, the dice will be resolving hunts & battles, and everyone ducks syphilis, volcanoes, & inexorable cooling using a Bios: Metafauna-like survival ethos. But this one is much more interactive, with a faster tempo, and player-choices less burdened. Gaining familiarity after a few plays should (I hope) provide a balanced risk/benefit ratio as it comes to things like taking brides, maintaining elders, and having an abundance of babies. If you push your luck and reach greedily, the world will remind you who's boss on the ice with only a few sheep to huddle with. And if you crater, that may be all you can do as you struggle to become viable. Player-elimination may have you going to the bar to buy the beer while the others finish.

That said, strategy & tactics seem intricate. The poly-/monotheism lynchpin doesn't have the richness of the Pax Topple & is more linear a route, but it hopefully has enough tactical nimbleness to be more than just one of two paths that are chosen after the first couple of turns. It does add religious themes with corresponding changes to your play, a rare thing, as well as funny or thoughtful banter to fit your mood.

Visually, I need to blacken the small symbols in the top right corner of the cards. The information it holds is too hard to pick out reading the table, and the colors of blue/green and red for the tribes is already best seen by the card location. This will improve seeing the complex information quickly.

*

Three player is where it shines. Two player may be OK, certainly subdued. But it was my first game.

Rule exceptions to absorb, so it needs some leeway on first play. If you are drawn to the theme & ideas, ride them through the initial bumps.

*

While my first game was a train wreck, that was entirely my fault for not getting the rules down & enough of a solo jaunt to get the flow. I thought Pax experience would get us there quickly and I was wrong. And my teaching was a horror. So take care & give the first play some teaching effort. It will be chaotic at the start, and the lack of knowing how to keep yourself alive may cause too early a rejection.

RATING: 7.5
First impression: this is a really intriguing game. 

Mechanically, it is a quirky and relatively simple dice game of resource control, negotiation and risk management. Think Some combination of Stoneage and Eldritch Horror.

But a further layer of complexity means it functions as a fascinating sandbox simulator. And that is what elevates the game. 

Everything here is laden with history and meaning. For example the way you can trade ideas, technologies and resources with your neighbours, hoping that they will benefit your people for generations to come. The way you have a chance not just to hunt but to domesticate certain species. How in order to have your people convert to monotheism, you need to break down the very foundation of your society, allowing your traditions to die (or even killing them off yourself).

A healthy dose of randomness will put off some players. But then this isnt a eurogame. It is an engine for creating rich and evocative sagas that you will stay with you for a while.

RATING: 9
1/1/18-I have been playing this every chance I get and man is it a great game. amazing story every time and a brutal system that ensures you are never in the clear as a game of this setting should be. Yes there is a lot of luck in the game, but how else are you going to model hunting which cares about skill but also is better to be lucky than good. plus there are many ways to mitigate that with marriages to daughters, the daughters you already have, inventions etc. also you can choose not to be so risky and spread your hunters thin. this game plays different every time and I am smarter and more informed from playing it and most importantly, it's completely unique. there is nothing like it out there except Neanderthal (also Phil Eklund).

the only thing keeping this from 9.5 or 10.0 is that luck still does run pretty high for my liking and for me a 10 game needs to have all the thrill and richness of a game like this but a bit more bias to skill rather than luck. that being said, it's still amazing and if a tournament group developed I could see it becoming more balanced as meta gaming increased.

almost forgot to mention, due to the open negotiations, event cards that don't always come out, different trade goods each game, different specie combos, etc this game is like a sandbox game that can be played in 2 hours or less. you can be peaceful with everyone, you can hunt easy but low payoff pray or just hunt big game, you can hunt big game and try to constantly raid and harass your opponents or any combination you can think of and they all might pay off depending on how the game develops and how you react to circumstances as they develop.

I think Eklund used this game to develop some ideas that he then applied to Pax Porfiriana. It's a very thematic and short version of Pax Porfiriana with an interesting theme. It has player interaction, enough difficulty to challenge the players and several ways to play depending on the tribe you choose.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Greenland is a Phil Eklund design that falls halfway between Pax Porfiriana and Bios Megafauna. It has the smooth mechanics and information dense card play of the former and the crushingly brutal struggle for survival of the latter. The game actively fights you and often the tribe vs. tribe conflicts fade to the background as everyone desperately tries to keep their head above water.

That's not to say that there aren't tools to mitigate the danger, as they are there, if you are lucky enough to find them. Still, do too well and the island will fight you even harder, as it can't support large populations. Perform poorly and your tribe will die. Perform well and every victory point you score will decimate the local fauna and deprive your tribe of a food source.

While that sounds frustrating, it does a very good job of modeling the real history of the region. Like most Eklund games, this is 50% simulation. Sometimes a perfectly planned hunt will be fruitless due to random chance or a dominant tribe will find their population cut in half by a random disease. This chaotic brutality will be a turn-off too many people, but those that enjoy historical narrative (and hard science) will find it here in spades.

Greenland is a fantastic game! I learned more than I ever thought possible about the history of Greenland, and in an enthralling and enchanting way - if only school would've been this fun.

The thing is you're not just learning from the rules, and flavor text, but from what actually happens in the game. Such as in a game, where the Thule collected trophies left and right, but of course in killing off the fauna, resulted in a grim outlook for future generations. The game taught me this by me seeing it happen before my eyes, not reading about it, but actually "living" it. This is what teaching should be like.

The solitaire game of trying to keep each culture alive through the entire 16 card event deck is tough going, but great fun.

I will auto-buy any future Phil Eklund games in similarly small packages.

I like the new, sleek look of the second edition cards, and the new graphical layout and overhaul actually helps the game play smoother. The game is still a thrill ride in trying to desperately scrounge up enough resources to survive. This is not a game for happy eurogamers that love point salads, this game will kick you in the nuts, and then spit on your poor luck. Yup, this one's a winner!

The educational value of this, and other Phil Eklund designs, should not be neglected. I feel smarter after playing his designs.

Played a few solo plays. Liked it very much. Rules are hard to learn though and the theme is debatable. Also luck is definetely a factor in the game. That said the game is very enjoyable with good interaction and lots of options and things you can do.

Another winner in the Great Battles of history series.  As always: SGBOH is the best way to go! :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The Roman period games are the best of GBOH, although I like the pre-Marian Legions better as they are a little more tactically interesting (not to mention that SPQR has a *lot* more scenarios). This set has some great battles, including Pharsalus, but they are almost all very large. Look forward to sitting down with them for a long time, and given the scenario quantity issue, this isn't as great a payoff on the learning effort. Still, an awesome period of history and a fundamentally quite interesting system.

Roman vs. Roman makes the game different as you feel like your fighting in a mirror.  The game system is great though.

Excellent and deep series of games that covers the whole gamut of ancient warfare.  If there is a battle, it&#039;s probably a scenario here somewhere.  Simple GBOH makes the game much more playable with virtually no loss in detail.

Acquired Jan 2010 CanCon - It's still very good, but would do well with an "update" like SPQR and Alexander received.  Some "rules" just feel missing (like Reaction Facing, which is found in the "errata" as and addition).  Interesting scenarios and set-ups though.

RATING: 5
The battles are generally large, maneuver is nigh impossible in most cases, and there is no chance to test one way of war against another. Ruspina is the exception to all of this and is probably the best scenario of the lot. The others are mostly unplayable with the regular rules set. This game needs the simple rules and it needs them badly.

Love the subject matter (Roman Civil Wars) and the game system hasn't proven to be too difficult.  An interesting study of "Quantity versus Quality" in ancient battles.

Battles from Caesar's Civil War period.  Some good battles here with Munda being my favorite.

RATING: 4
Legion on legion isn't really that interesting in GBoH, so this is a pretty dull entry in the series.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not as nice a game as the first couple of entries in the GBoH series (Alexander, SPQR). The scenarios in this game suffer from bigger size ( = takes longer to play) and less tactical differentiation among units, since both sides are basically fielding Roman legions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Legion on Legion action!  Less variety in unit types, but still quite interesting.  Has some very large battles (Pharsalus and Munda).  I play primarily with the SIMPLE rules set.

An old game worthy of reprinting.  The base game has only very large battles and very small, unusual engagements.  Download the c3i articles and get the SGBoH counters to play the smaller sized scenarios.

GboH is one of the most interesting game system I've ever played, but I don't like to play a game  where the 2 opposing armies are... the same army, use the same tactics, the same command system

5 Battles. More late republica battles in Dictator, Jugurtha and Veni, Vidi, Vici expansions and C3I magazines.

Quite a good game, but not my favorite in the GBOH series.  Still, you have to love the power of this many legions when they come into conflict.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I have to admit that I don't play this one as much as other GBoH games I own - SPQR, Alex, Cataphract, even Caesar Gaul.  Maybe it's because the scenarios are HUGE - up to 20 legions for both sides - or because legion vs legion battles are just plain boring.  Anyway, the maps and counters are first-rate and the rules are fine and the scenarios are for the most part quite balanced.  It's just not much fun watching Romans slaughter Romans.

Tried with SGBOH rules and went fairly well, a big improvement over original system.  Would rate a 7 when using the SGBOH rules.

The battles are BIG, maneuver is scarce and since the combatants battles using same system armies this often translates in an exercise in extreme wristage. Uninteresting game all in all.

RATING: 6
Too many markers.  By turn three of battle most of the pretty counters are covered by stacks of markers.  A bit much rule overhead for the gameplay.  Though it lacks the detail I prefer Commands and Colors to this well intentioned system.

Hail Caesar! Covers the major battles of the Roman Civil Wars during 48-45 B.C.  In this game the 'Jacta alea est' (The die is cast) many times.  To think, if he didn't cross the Rubicon we wouldn't have this fine game to play? 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Low rating is for the lack of balance the system produces in the battles - I just can't find a way for JC to lose Pharsalus, and the other set-piece battles are equally one-sided.  It all feels cooked and not terribly historical (unless you think the sources exaggerate the desperation of the fight at Pharsalus in order to make Caesar's victory look like a triumph over tough odds, a perfectly justifiable position that makes for a disappointing game.)  Easily the least interesting of the GBoH series, in terms of competitive battles.

The expansion module (Dictator?) has a couple of battles which are also certain Roman wins, but provide intriguing puzzles.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Eh.  Legion vs. Legion isn't very interesting in the GBOH world, where most battles feature distinctive forces.  A slugfest.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Later Republican Roman GBOH system limited by its uneven battles, though Tapsus can be fun if the optional rules are used, doubled the size and morale of the Senatorial Army. Pharsalus is the largest battle, but the legions are so close together that the two sides have little choice but the charge head long into each other. I kept it for a few years as part of the GBOH family.

I liked the Pharsalus and the Thapsus scenario. Can't remember much about the others, although I am sure to have played them all.

Scenarios played so far:
Dyrrhachium, Lesnikia, Pharsalus, Ruspina, Thapsus, Munda

A Bridge too near, Corfinium (from C3i #4)

GBoH series are one of the best strategy games ever. The leadership rules realy makes a differense against other games there you are free to move every soldier in play at everyy given time. In GBoH - if there is no leader no move...

One of my favourite games in the series, with some nicely-balanced battles. I enjoy the straight-up legion versus legion fights.

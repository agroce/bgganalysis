Superb components and clear rules make this a perfect introductory game for new wargamers aged 12+. In fact, it’s a game I wish I had at that age. It will teach the basics of air platforms and ordnance through a nicely crafted rear section reference area and imbue some of the tactical and operational issues faced fighting a modern air and land-based threat. Experienced wargamers looking for a beer and pretzels “game of war” will be satisfied too. But grognards among us will recognise little doctrinal nuance—while the puzzle of putting the components to best use will easily be solved. 8/10 for new hobbyists, 7/10 for knowledgable wargamers which is my overall rating here.

This is a beefy solitaire game.  There is a lot of thought into selecting your pilots, their ordinance, and the attack plan.

The components are great: mounted boards, thick cards, great art on the counters, and well-written instructions.

Update: I lowered the rating.  A lot of folks really dig the Leader series, but I just don't.

Pre-ordered from UK e-tailer, arrived Xmas Eve!

I enjoyed playing the PDF/Vassal Hornet Leader II and its three expansions Carrier Air Group, Cold War and Marine Air. Carrier Air Ops is essentially a boxed version of all this content and then some. A great solitaire system just got better!

I love this game for solitaire play.  It doesn't take up a lot of space, although it's still *just* enough that it shows I have an undersized table.  Setup can be a slight drag if you'll only get to play one game before putting it away again, but once you understand the core of the game flow, you can usually blow through a couple of missions easily in a sitting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Great game. Very engaging and tense. 

The planning part is really fun, where you decide which aircraft you'll use on the mission and how you'll arm them.
And seeing how your planning unfolds during the mission is priceless.

I've bought U-boat leader just based on my experience with this game, but Hornet is much better.

UPDATE: Playing Thunderbolt/Apache Leader made me wish Hornet Leader also had some sort of map. And because of that, I've traded Hornet away.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Lots of campaigns, lots of targets, lots of pilots to choose from. It's like Phantom Leader on steroids. The fact it includes all skill levels for all pilots is a huge plus, as my favourite thing about these games is in watching the squadron progress as the campaign goes on.

There's also lots of weapons and cool toys, but that brings me to what I feel is the main negative about the game: mission planning feels very similar, and you end up going about different missions mostly the same way, with the same tactics and the same weapons. Surprisingly, maybe even more so than with PL. 

The large number of different campaigns and squadron progression ensures that there's a good narrative in the game. Flying the missions does get repetitive, though, so it has to be taken in small doses.

Edit: Going back to the game, I once again find that the special options system as is limits your choices too much, and it's an important factor in making mission planning feel monotonous and missions playing out the same way every time. Ended up revising my rating down a bit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
What not to like ? The box is full of great components and contains enough material to ensure dozens of hours of fun: 8 different campaigns, over 60 missions, 100s of pilots and a LOT of different weapons to choose from. Although it uses the same system as Phantom Leader, Hornet Leader is a step up because of the increased number of possible combinations in the preparation phase and the fact that missions are one turn longer each. HL is well-designed, well-balanced and will spend many, many happy hours on my desk.

While I tried to play the Apache Thunderbolt version 25 years ago I didn't like the system then, nor do I like it today...

And that's odd since it is strictly a solo system and I am a solo player. 

The reason is the total random AI bot which is based on die rolls. Now more than earlier I realise that there are much better AI bots in existence.

While this DR mechanism works as an adventure in games like Avalon Hill's B17, or Raid on St Nazaire or GMT The Hunters where tension is build up, it isn't nearly exciting in this game.

Some may like it, I simply do not find it interesting enough.

Solid solo game. Painful at the beginning, until you´ve learned how to use the different weapon types. Indipendent weapons are very strong...might be realistic, but for me makes the game a little less interesting than Phantom Leader. Pretty repetitive after a while. A bigger overall story would help a lot to keep the campaign interesting.

Preorder arrived 12/11/2010. It looks beautiful. I am a little sad though that my copy of the original Hornet Leader is finally standing down after almost 20 years of play.

I have now been playing for almost two months now and I have to say this one of the best solitaire wargames out there. The replay value is tremendous, as it comes with 8 campaigns (+2 official ones you can download at DVG's site) that can be played for 3 different lengths of time, the option to play as US Navy or US Marines, and numerous combinations of aircraft types and campaign variants.

A cool fighter-bomber card-driven game.  I really like the aircraft/pilot selection mechanic and the flexibility of adding my own weapon loadouts to my squadrons based on the initial target.  I like how bandits try to intercept you and how SAM and AAA fire is handled.  Given the number of different scenarios, the different campaign lengths, and the variability of the event and target cards, replayability seems high.  I am quite pleased with this game!

What a cool game. I just find the setup and playthrough a little tedious for solo play when it would be fine on a computer. 

While this is a great game, I find I don't enjoy the planning stage of this as much as the "action" stage. You first select your aircraft, determine your mission (and target), and then arm your aircraft with ordnance. Each aircraft has certain weapons it can carry and also a weight limit. This makes for some difficult decisions. You then send your pilots off on their mission, and again, there are lots of painful decisions to make as things can happen that you didn't plan for. 

Has a really cool campaign system where pilots earn experience to become better pilots. But, you also have to do some human resource management, as each pilot will experience stress from flying missions which can cause them to become unfit for duty until they are rested for a bit or sent on R&R.

It's a computer game.  Perfect campaign computer war game like Panzer General or Fantasy Wars.  My doods level up from scrub to ninja, others get horribly mangled on a double barrel roll they still get damaged on and miss the next 4 missions hitting 11 stress their first flight, I feel like I am making progression towards a campaign goal, it's really everything.  I am having trouble staying focused on work because I'm thinking of my 5th mission sitting on the card table over there.  

Will have to wait until another campaign or two to see if it can hold on to a 9 - are campaigns different enough?

So much of the game is spending 10 minutes choosing what pilots/planes you want to use, followed by 10 minutes of choosing the bomb payload, and that's before you actually get into playing the actual game, which is abstracted heavily and by that point I'm ready to pack it up and put it away.  Just not my thing.

Acquired March 2014.

Essentially identical to GMT version except for combining pilot & aircraft cards into single card (albeit with 6 levels of pilot skill) and "improved" graphics. 

Well, improved or arguably a different style (or even overdone) graphics.  Some new aircraft and missions/targets. Should be easy to learn IF you have played GMT version and lots of downloadable play aids and other goodies in the BGG files section.

More a graphics update than a re-invention. Arguably overpriced, but the nice shiny components will please many especially CCG fans making a transition.

I'm of two minds about this game. On the one hand, it's pretty simple for a wargame, with weapon selection being the only real variable. It's very abstract, and is essentially a spreadsheet with some game elements attached.

However, I have spent hundreds of hours creating and running units for BattleTech, and running a squadron here really hits those same notes. There's something fun to me about filling in the details between the missions with a story. So, maybe not for everyone, but I like it.

Awesome solitare game.  A mission itself is usually 20 to 30 minutes.  Add in another 20 to 30 minutes for setup and teardown if you can't leave the game setup somewhere.  Infra and Intel tracks help offset the stressed out pilots, but you'll still have some times when the dice or counters don't fall your way.

A good solo game.  Can be quite long and involved, or short and noncommitted.  The differences between Navy forces and Marine forces, and how they fight, makes for a very enjoyable mix of fun and enjoyment for the game.

I've only played one campaign, but the game was very fun.  I did have a few questions that were answered here (like F-14 Tomcast SO cost (free)).  My weapons counters were printed signficantly offset, which was a bummer.  The short Iraq 1991 campaign was a good introduction scenario (i.e. not too hard).  Love the number of planes available.

A vitaminized version of Phantom Leader: more planes, more options, more weapons... and more deadly enemies. The best of the series.

After so many games, I have lowered my score from 9 to 7.
Still a good game, but I 'm starting to feel like it's way to much driven by luck.

Whatever strategy and planning you do on every mission, in the end, your fate is always decided by the roll of a d10.

No matter what pilot, skills and ordnances you're carrying, if you're on a bad roll streak, you're done! 

It seems that luck factor is the main difficulty setting in the game and it makes me feel like I'm playing risk sometimes, although with Risk, its less of an issue because I'm in a Risk mindset, not in a simulation/war game mindset where luck shouldn't be the primary decision maker in the game.

RATING: 10
Great game. A solitaire game that's completely replayable, yet filled with meaningful decision-making! The most important phase is in the planning: figuring out who to send out, and what sort of load-outs to equip your aircraft with. Then you send them off on their mission and hope they have what they need to successfully pull it off. It's all great fun.

I like this game more than my rating might indicate, but I tend to rate solitaire-only games a bit lower since I prefer playing FtF... just letting you know my bias.  

But this game is very good.  The campaigns are fun, the target runs can sometimes be intense, and I feel some emotional connection with my team of pilots.  The decisions about which target to select, which pilots to take, how to arm them, and how to approach the target are all fun.  The tactical decisions made during the run are generally less interesting (but still fun)to me since I'm just following the plan (unless something goes seriously wrong, or a very disruptive event comes up, both of which sometimes happen).

Traded to Barry for a few games he was passing along.  I didn't play it enough to really explore it, but I have liked The Hunters more for the bit of solo wargaming I've tried.  I had loaned it to Barry because he wanted to try it, but didn't get around to it, so when Barry was moving and passing along games, I offered this in exchange.  Hopefully mutually beneficial!

Solitaire. 

I'm finding it to be not quite as fun as the original GMT version (Hornet Leader) despite the extra cards/counters and realistic-looking graphics.  I think it may be because I liked the more complex gameplay and bright graphics of the original, and I'm finding all the cards to sort through a bit annoying in the new version.  But there is a lot in the box and many variations with optional rules to keep it interesting.  The ability to use situational awareness points (SA) makes the game too easy to win, though, IMHO.

RATING: 8
Fun solo game. I only played a single learning mission followed by the short campaign, but I can see how a longer campaign can be much more rewarding when effects like stress and experience play a larger role.

I think I'll start randomly choosing my starting pilots at the beginning of the campaign to speed things up and lessen the micro management feel, otherwise I'll be choosing the same guys over and over for each campaign. 

Also the missions themselves just feel kinda short, but I need to remember that additional complexity isn't what this game is about.

Update: Played a longer campaign today. Much more rewarding, and I chose random pilots (I still selected the fighter mix however) which added a nice dynamic to the game. I knew I had to get the less skilled pilots up to speed in order to tackle later missions so there was more planning needed to balance things out, than up front min/maxing at the beginning of the game. Upped my rating a bit.

RATING: 7
Little bit extended in some points (targets special abilities, infra, recon track), but I have a feelings is a "casual" version of old good tactical Hornet Leader. Most hitted is a air combat, downgraded to just simply dice rolling, no more "real" air cover for ground attack units, dogfight or leader/wingman formations choices. Now anyone, anywhere can do "dogfight", even if you just dropped your bombs over the target. Also the planes are not working in pairs anymore, creating the "unrealistic" feeling of free running around. The attacks are now made in order so you can wait and see the others attacks before expended more munition. VP scoring practically don't exist, you only gain full VP for mission or nothing. So in total I think game lost more then gained.
After all is still good game. 7/10

Getting motivated with this game after viewing Marco's excellent video review.  Never thought of this game having so much fun with the allocation of weapon mix on missions with different pilots.  Plus, the card art of individual combat planes is awesome.

A comment from Garfink somewhat offsets Marco's view:  "I like most wargames I've played but if I had to name one game that I was disappointed in most recently is Hornet Leader: Carrier Air Operations, this game was very enticing when reading the rules and for about 1/4 way through my first game, then it became very monotonous and repetitive after that. After trying 2 scenarios, I really don't want to play it ever again as I felt that I've gotten all that I can out of it."

I'm new to solitaire games but this one is the best I own by far. Extreme tension and fun, plus it's a very challenging game (in a good way). Many campaigns, tons of weapons, tons of pilots to choose from (I played Phantom Leader before this one came out and I tell you, choosing pilots in PL was a breeze). Rules are very well written and very easy overall. Game mechanics are great. While combat is full of dice rolls, the game definitely favors strategy and thinking over luck. Carefully plan your mission, arm your aircrafts and fly the mission as best as you can and you'll be rewarded.

[b]8: Very good game. Rarely disappoints me. High on my request/recommend list.[/b] 

Great entry in the Leader series. Tight game play, easy to get on the table, play a mission or two a night, and leave setup until finished. Bit easier than Phantom Leader, but the Cold War/Modern/slightly futuristic scenarios are really enjoyable as well.

Wow... This combines the team management of bloodbowl with a fast play time. I really become attached to my pilots in a way that is rare in card/board games. Cinimatic, fast, and fun! It's greatest drawback is the mass of components... Most games of this size collect dust because of the setup time but I've found a little creative organization and this is managable.

Update: this is dropping since TAL replaced it.

There's no denying that there's plenty of fun in this box. The production quality is generally superb, though the rulebook has annoying typos. The role-playing and mission planning are an incredibly potent hook to the game, and I echo what others have said about its intense immersive qualities. All of that should be enough, and probably is, but I can't help wishing the design had worked a little harder to project some additional realism around the missions and campaigns. In particular, the swarm of random Bandits one is likely to encounter over a target strains credulity, especially in the historical situations. 

Yeah, I know: that's an artifact of what I want the game to be, not what the designer intended it to be. HL and its sibling Phantom Leader are among the very best solo gaming experiences the hobby has to offer.

Wow! This is my first DVG game I tried. It is fascinating how involved I get playing this. I like the game system very much - in particular the experience point system for the pilots is great. In the last missions I flew I learned the hard way that a Veteran is way better than a Newbie... I am looking forward to exploring this game further. Due to the provided campaigns it seems to have a high replayability factor.

RATING: 10
Phantom Leader has grown up a little.  Aside from the tweak with Situational Awareness (SA), the missions thus far seem to be much finer grain in difficulty - I cannot get careless for a moment.  From selecting the squadron to attempting each mission, I've found careful planning a must.  

In my last mission, I finally found a reason to split my flight and it worked perfectly.

I find that once I pull this game out, I don't want to stop playing.  It is obviously designed from a solo perspective IMO.  I never feel like the game is [artificially] playing me.  I am in a do-or-die series of missions trying to achieve an overall success rate that demonstrates competence.  I once lost my only Veteran pilot in the second mission on back-to-back rolls of 10.  I almost quit the campaign but could not bear the thought of giving up when things got tough.  I finished the campaign with an Adequate rating and got my lost pilot back on the final mission.  I felt a great sense of accomplishment.

So far, another solo winner from Dan.  And my name is on the box to boot!

Why this is a 10:
+ I do want to play this most all of the time
+ I enjoy setting up and executing a plan
+ I especially like it when a plan comes together (Hannibal - A-Team)
+ I have enjoyed learning about the aircraft and munitions used
+ Strategic planning with tactical adjustments in an hour or less (for each mission)

RATING: 10
A proof that solitaire gaming can be fun. Playing Hornet Leader makes me feel that I'm playing an actual game not just to try simulate something or solve a crosswords.

Due to rather simple rules and game sequence you don't have to check the rule book all the time for every tiny modifier. A wide variety of planes/pilots, targets and ammo makes every game different and forces you to plan your attacks very differently. Event cards can make sudden changes to your perfect plan, but they are not going ruin the game experience with excessive randomness. Campaigns are very well designed and you have to keep up the good work through the whole campaing if willing to achieve even a good rating.

Making an exception to my rule of not logging solo plays of a game, since this is solo ONLY.

An improvement on Phantom Leader, adding more of.. well.. everything. Takes a bit longer to get started with the vastly bigger selection of pilot combination's and rank's. Politics done away with, a few new abilities added in. Ranges have increased across the board, map is bigger, and longer time is spent over target to compensate.

All in all, good game, good buy, glad i have it.

Played just once so far, but I'm less than wowed by this game. The components are pretty (if subject to warping), but I found the rules hard to work my way through and then refer back to during play. Game play itself was so-so: a lot of prep/setup and record keeping, and not that much fun action. I'd call the game overly fiddly.

RATING: 7
The best solitaire experience I have had since B-17: Queen of the Skies.  I love how a mission can be completed in as little as 30 minutes, although I often linger over the planning phase as I consider all the various equipment options.  I just wish we had the spare table space for me to keep it set up for several days running.

RATING: 8
Nifty game that one can just jump in and play very soon after unboxing as you go through the rules for the first time. Play is quick and exciting and I don't think I made any errors on my first mission either which is truly rare and just makes me feel damn good about the experience! Rating 8 for now and will update after a few more missions. 

=====================================

Still one of my favorites, but it can get a bit repetitive.

RATING: 10
I bought this game having ZERO interest in modern aircraft carrier, modern air combat and it won me over completely. The problems the player must solve and the decisions he must make seem quite authentic and intelligent planning for a mission is usually rewarded - make a mistake and you are usually punished. And just enough luck thrown in to make it exciting. Fun game, beautifully packaged and presented. Easy rules that one rarely has to access. Possible to play first mission minutes after unboxing. Flawless.

Fantastic solo Leader game that can serve\r an an introduction to the Leader series.

I like how you have to carefully plan your flying squadron's composition and loadout in order to be successful. I love the fact that it has so many counters. I also like the campaign system that is in place. I truly feel like I am commanding a squadron of pilots, and the fact that managing them is almost more fan than bombing the target which is the end game.

I understand that some people find ALL the above a turn off. They would prefer a more detailed firefight section of the game and less time spent managing and loading weapons. Well, this is called HORNET LEADER and not HORNET PILOT for a reason.

What can I say that others haven't already said. For the solo gamer, this game is GREAT! Extremely re-playable with immersive game-play.

RATING: 9
Beautiful graphics and components,  but I found the gameplay to be repetitive and not very challenging.

Once the player learns which armaments to load for a mission,  then it's just a matter of relying on good dice rolls to deliver maximum damage to the target. 

It's a pretty rare occasion that an enemy missile will ever hit one of your aircraft.  

For this reason,  the game feels more like a turkey shoot.  Sold it.

I'm not a fan of cardboard-counter wargames ("wargames" always means something played with painted miniatures in my corner of the universe).

Nor am I a fan of solitaire games.  Computers tend to do a better job of entertaining me when not playing something face-to-face.

But Hornet Leader is a *great* game.  Full of atmosphere, where each campaign - and every mission in each campaign - tells a story.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Like Phantom Leader, a great yet simple game that not only deals with technical details but also (amazingly!) concerns itself with crew fatigue and stress. A very enjoyable and worthwhile game. There's nothing like getting a target, selecting the weapons for the job and then watching your attack fall apart when the unexpected happens - brilliant stuff. Wish they could make a regular, Harpoon style game based around this system.

PS - I believe one weapon counter actually represents between 2-4 actual weapons.

The best of the DVG Leader series. Lots of campaign scenarios spanning from Cold War 1980's to the near future, with many optional rules. Tons of aircraft and weapons that allow you to vary tactics for each mission. I love the RPG aspect as your pilots develop through experience. Difficulty can ramp up quickly as negative event cards can and often do force you to change your plans.

This is my favorite game!

[b]The Good[/b]
:d10-1: There are so many variables in this game that the replay value seems...limitless. While the framework your actions are decided within is largely the same each campaign (variation due to campaign differences and optional rules), the amount of variables that go into the play of each mission and campaign ensure you'll never quite know for sure what the best course of action is or how the outcome will play out.

:d10-2: The game has a strong RPG element in that your pilots will improve their ranking and skills due to experienced gained through the missions they fly. You watch as pilots start out and become better attackers, better leaders, more confident, etc. You will feel huge sighs of relief when they survive multiple vicious enemy attacks to bomb the target on a bold attack and feel disheartened when your pilot goes MIA due to an attack and is never recovered. The challenges your pilots face and the stresses they build will become your challenges and stress.

:d10-3: Your pilots can't do everything. While they're highly trained, they are not superheroes. They will accrue stress that impacts their ability to successfully attack the enemy. Push them too hard or put them in situations they're not equipped for and the stress will accrue rapidly and slow or halt your plans to bring devastation to your enemy.

:d10-4: A wide variety of campaigns pits you against enemy nations who have a wide variety of military forces and targets to fight against. They all have different strengths in regard to their infrastructure and ability to thwart your intelligence and recon ability. Each campaign occurs during a specific year, which determines the availability of munitions and aircraft.

:d10-5: The munitions available have their own abilities, strengths, weaknesses, and costs. You'll have to figure out the proper configuration to succeed given your target, anticipated resistance, what's available, and how much sway you have to get the good weapons. Use your political capital (SO Points) too fast and too early and you will limit your options later in the game. 

:d10-6: There are a variety of aircraft available and each has a unique set of weapons available and payload they can carry. Take A-6s and crush your enemy with lots of ordinance, or choose A-7s with a much smaller payload but give you more political capital (SO Points) to spend? The availability of aircraft depend on the year of the campaign and whether you choose to fly a Navy squadron or a Marine squadron of AV-8B Harriers.

:d10-7: The action occurs fast and is brutal. Missions play quickly and it won't take long to decipher the outcome. Your enemies will be quickly left in smoking ruins, or your pilots will perform poorly and miss attacks, or you'll witness a tense outcome that leaves your star pilot MIA but the target obliterated.

:d10-8: Tactical decisions are tense, and so is the planning stage. Proper planning gives you greater odds of success while poor planning will doom you to failure. Will you carry munitions to suppress enemy attacks, or will you carry ECM pods and hope on foiling attacks with electronic countermeasures? Which pilots do you send? Send the stressed out all star to increase your odds of success? Or should you hold him back to recover so he can fly the following day? How many targets will you attack? Do you have enough pilots to go for two; is the risk of spreading yourself too thin worth it? Will you spend SO Points on the best weapons, or save some for refueling and R&R for your pilots?

:d10-9: Command and control is important and your choices in this regard come with their own benefits and costs. Do you take E-2C Hawkeyes to provide situational awareness to your pilots, grant them bonuses to their attacks, and who can prevent the onset of bad events at the expense of a combat aircraft? Or do you increase your ordnance delivering ability by choosing a combat aircraft but sacrificing the ability to react proactively to bad events and reduce your command of the skies?

:d10-1::d10-0: A variety of options are available. Each campaign can be played with a Navy or Marine squadron. Each can be played for a short, medium, or long duration campaign. Promote your pilots at the beginning to start off strong at the cost of SO Points, or go in more inexperienced but with more SO Points? Want to make things more difficult or easier? There are a variety of options available. Want to just change the gameplay? Opt for high stress attacks, choose to fly some missions as chaotic nighttime attacks, choose to be able to replace downed pilots, or choose to accept a random assortment of pilots & aircraft for bonus SO Points.

:d10-1::D10-1: Random variables, multitudes of options, tension with each die roll, getting to know your pilots; this game has it.

:d10-1::D10-2: Each campaign creates an awesome narrative. This game tells a story. And it's different each time. This is one of the most important things about this game for me. By the end of a campaign, you've sweated and bled with your pilots, been there when they've pulled off miraculous victories and whiffed easy attacks. You're sad when you lose one and proud when you promote one.

:d10-1::D10-3: Missions play quickly though campaigns can take a long time (short, medium, long). Just have half an hour? Play one mission & pack it away for the next game time. You don't have to finish in one sitting and you won't have to keep it set up where the kids or cats might knock it to the floor.

:d10-1::D10-4: I think the rulebook is great. You can almost start playing as you read. It takes you from start to finish through a campaign. The text is written clearly and should be easy to understand. There are a few misprints in the book, but corrections can be found easily on BGG.

[b]Neutral to Ugly elements[/b]

:d10-1: Bookkeeping. This game has it. You have to track stress, experience, SO Points, victory points, promotions, etc. You don't have to do a lot, but it may be more than some want to do. If you hate using a pencil & paper for a board game, be forewarned. Conversely if you like stats, tracking information, and telling a story, you will certainly be able to do that here.

:d10-2: Lots of cards. Find a way to organize them. Otherwise gameplay will slow as setup time increases. Buy a binder with card holding sheets. Don't want to got to that effort? Prepare for longer setup/tear down or maybe you should steer clear.

:d10-3: The standard difficulty seems a little too easy for me after so many plays. It's not easy, but it could be more difficult. Plan on using some optional rules to increase difficulty.

:d10-4: This is a game, not a simulation. Lots of things are abstracted and simplified that keep it well away from the simulation category. If you're looking for a simulation, this isn't it. If you want to play Tom Cruise in Top Gun, this is your game.

[b]Summary[/b]

I have only positive things to say about this game. Though the framework of each campaign is roughly the same, each has felt different to me with how it has played out. There are multiple branches to the decision tree here; I never know exactly what the outcome will be. I highly recommend this to solitaire gamers and war gamers. High tech rapid deadly combat; pilots that improve their skills & confidence over time; lots of different targets and events to challenge the player; just a fun, unique game!

RATING: 7
The game is a management puzzle of effectively building a team of pilots and successfully undertaking a series of military strikes in one of the campaigns provided. It's much like a football management game aimed at modern military aircraft enthusiasts. You build a team of pilots of varying abilities, strengths and weaknesses. Planes are a mixture of post Vietnam US Navy and Marines. Then you arm them with all the varied weapons, air to air, air to ground, ECM pods - all in various forms and all carefully selected based upon weight points your planes can carry and the targets you've selected to strike. On the way to the target you'll deal with bandits and ground defences. Once you've negotiated all that you'll need to strike your target or targets with enough ordinance and precision to destroy it for a successful mission. Then you have to get back to base.

So, like in any good football manager game, you'll have to deal with fatigue (here it's stress) in your pilots. Manage it well and your pilots will perform optimally and improve. This is one of the main challenges in the game. Scenarios are designed to make it a challenge and once you start playing you'll immediately see the value in mixing your attack group on any mission with fast attack pilots, or an F-14 with long range Phoenix missiles, or spending Situational Awareness (SA), to get the jump on the bandits. Use your pilots strengths and arm them accordingly.

There's masses of choices to be made here. Decisions to be made in both the planning and execution of a mission. Decisions that will affect the whole campaign. For instance, before a mission you can spend Special Option (SO) points (currency in the game), to use better planes, or improve your pilots, or carry certain weapons. Choose inferior planes and get some SO points back in the bank. Use those SO points after a mission to reduce stress on your pilots. What are you going to arm your planes with? Too many air to air missiles and you mightn't have enough firepower to eliminate the target. Too few air to air missiles and you mightn't even reach the target. Will you use your best air to ground pilot on an easy mission, or give him a day to rest before whatever might be assigned to you tomorrow? Will you expend valuable ordinance to make a suppression attack or risk a hit? Will your pilots increase their stress levels and undertake evasive manoeuvres, or risk it and power onwards to the target area?

I found the rules a little tricky to follow. I would have set them out slightly differently. The best way to learn is to give them a quick read through and then jump right into a short mission. By the middle of that mission you'll know 95% of what there is to know. By this point the game will be flowing smoothly and quickly. While it's all fairly low complexity I'd certainly say that previous knowledge of these planes and weapons will make it much easier to play and to enjoy. If you know the difference between a Sparrow and a Sidewinder already then you're probably the target market for this game and you'll enjoy it if you like solo games. If I was a fan of solo gaming I'd probably rank this a 9 or 10, but a 7 ranking isn't bad and solely reflects my personal luke warm feelings about solo gaming.

Here's the thing: This is a game for gamers who have an interest in the subject. (Have you ever wondered how an air war in Iran might play out?) It's a game for gamers who don't mind shuffling counters around and rolling dice to determine event resolutions. But most of all it's a game for solo gamers - not the computer fast action solo gamer - solo gamers who enjoy managing a football team of strike aircraft pilots who like blowing things up and getting home to tell the tale... to... themselves.

I have the vassal version which is the predecessor to this printed version.  

It's a really fun solo experience with good decision making and planning.  The time to play a mission is short which makes it ideal when you don't have a lot of time but would like to play something.  The vassal version is an added bonus because storage is one mouse click away.

Basically [b]Phantom Leader[/b] but in high gear. The technological disparity between enemy forces and your own are significantly greater than in [b]Phantom Leader[/b], it's Vietnam Era counterpart.

You have plentiful and widespread access to some of the best guided munitions available, such as the GBU–38 that can independently track targets, AGM–65 Maverick that can cause multiple hits across dispersed targets, AGM–130 with its long range and high damage. You also have access to the E–2C Hawkeye airborne early warning and control plane, EA–18G Hornet electronic warfare–equipped fighter, and even a speculative F–35B Lightning II.

The best analogy to this game is a more elegant version of the [b]Harpoon 4[/b] adaptation found in [b]Persian Incursion[/b]. Wargamers that enjoy technical thrillers (e.g. Tom Clancy or Larry Bond) will love the detail in aircraft loadouts and the planning that goes into strike missions. No matter how many times you play it, the scenarios vary, and even the smallest mistake can potentially lead to the loss of most of your aircraft.

This is the third time that I buy this game. But now it's different. Its amazing components (though the Event cards could use a number and I've found some of them lacking in precision), the chrome added since the last version and the tough decisions the player faces, sum up to make this one the best edition of the game.

After one medium campaign I want to get it on the table again. It's short and you can play one/two missions per hour tops. The game generates great narrative. Thanks to the designer for the new mechanisms (Situational Awareness being only one of them) to enrich the player's role.

I think all these games are great.  The theme is interesting to me, and the planning stages are good. I've played this one and Phantom Leader a good amount.  Main differences are that I feel Hornet Leader is a bit easier, and more amenable to changes during the over target portions of the mission.  Phantom Leader is very dependent  upon pre mission planning. I have TAL too, and I want to get some plays of that one in, but haven't been able to.

  Excellent game. Lots of modern aircraft and weapons to choose from (love that A6). My Favorite part is selecting your planes and pilots, and arming them for the mission.

  You get a ton of counters in this game. Worth every penny.

  One of 10 games I would not part with.

Oddly captivating. A lot of fun even! But I can't really explain why. Even though the components are top notch the gameplay LOOKS kind of boring and reading the rules still gives the impression that the game is semi dull. Then you start playing and you just want to keep going. Get it while you can!

Extremely fun solitaire wargame.  A very strong narrative develops over the course of a campaign.  A very impressive design that has me interested in trying some other Dan Verssen solitaire games.

The second of the DVG Leader Series games I've tried, after Thunderbolt Apache Leader. I think I like Hornet Leader a bit better as it plays much quicker and is a simpler, more streamlined game. I've only played the introductory Iraq 1991 campaign so far. Initial rating of 7.

10 plays: Have now played the short and medium Iraqi campaigns and I'm having a blast. Rating increased to 8.

20 plays: I've now finished all Iraqi campaigns including the long campaign as the USN. I'm finding it very easy going so far (good evaluation in the short campaign and great evaluations in the medium and long campaigns) but I expect the other campaigns will ramp up the difficulty level. Note that I'm counting each mission as 1 play, not each campaign. Stays at 8.

Brilliant game, but setup does take a while.  Playing multiplayer is simple, and actually makes for a great time coming up with a strike package and strategy.  Definitely recommend the Random Squadron Generator spreadsheet to speed things up.  Makes for lots of fun time and stories.

The best solitaire game I've ever played! It makes me want to be a responsible squadron commander. It makes me want to take care of my pilots. And it makes me really want to take out Gadhafi in my Libya 2011 Campaign (free download from DVG).

Ok, seriously. This is a game with a *very high* fun factor. And when you play alone at night, you actually feel the loneliness of being the only person making all the decisions, not to mention the tension of a real squadron commander on a mission, as well as the weight of command on your shoulder. And when flying, the thrill of dogfighting and bombing runs keep you on the edge of your seat with each missile you fire and each bomb you drop. That is why I am always looking forward to playing Hornet Leader after a hard day of work!

Finally, a solo game that actually is a solo game, not a multi-player pretending to be one (as is often the case these days). As Willie Wonka would say, "the snozberries taste like snozberries"! Before playing the game, I was a bit apprehensive, thinking it will be too complex, and needing knowledge of different missiles. Modern jet warfare is also not a period I've had an interest in playing before. However, after a few games, it turned out to be straightforward, though there are a lot of little things to remember during game play, that can easily be forgotten. And having a palette of different missiles to choose from was not the problem I thought it would be.

For me, the guts of the game is that it has two distinctive halves - sort of like the original Law & Order TV series where the first half was the police work, and the second half was the court trial.

In this case, the first half is that you get a target site, with some limited intelligence as to how it is defended. You then work out how to attack that target through selecting the right pilots, weaponry and the approach. The second half is the actual tactical mission taking place. The defenders will, in most cases, be changed from what you planned for, and you play it out, seeing if it all comes to together and if the target gets destroyed. When I first tried the game, I thought the planning part was going to be a chore, but it has turned out to be just as much fun as the tactical fight, as you think and try to anticipate of all the different possiblities. If there is a major miscalculation in the planning, the tactical fight can turn out to be a disaster - often you end up with too much of one type of ordnance and not enough of what you really need.

Putting each individual mission into the context of a campaign adds another dimension. Now there is "team management" where you can burn out your pilots if they go on too many missions. There is also management of limited resources in the form of SO points. As the campaign goes on, another interesting mechanic is that the enemy infrastructure and capabilities weaken if you are succesful from mission to mission. It becomes an immersive experience, where you can fly many missions without the loss of a plane, and just when it seems easy, and you do lose a plane, it comes as a great shock - but this just adds extra resolve to see it all through to a successful finish.

Well worth the effort.

[COLOR=#FFFFFF][BGCOLOR=#000000]1P[/BGCOLOR][/COLOR] Each mission plays quickly but the game has a great narrative that develops over the course of each campaign. The most important phase is in the planning where you need to figure out who to send on the missions, and what sort of loat-outs to equip.

My first DVG game so I have a soft spot for it buy all the same this is a wonderful game. I love every part of it from loading the ordnance onto the aircraft and planning the sortie to time over target and the debrief/book-keeping afterwards.

Highly recommended.

I've decided to up my rating of this game to a perfect 10! This is simply the best solitaire game I've ever played. Sure, like all solitaire games it's a bit of a puzzle, but it's so shock full of tough decisions, planning, strategy, and tactics that I absolutely adore the game.

It is incredibly rewarding to select a mission, pick the pilots, outfit their planes, and then take off on the mission and hope that your plan pays out. This is the only solitaire game that I would ever consider playing over lesser ranked games with some friends.

If you have considered trying solitaire gaming, then this should be your first choice. The game features a near perfect mix of strategy and tactics. The strategic bits include spending OS on campaign options, planes and pilots, as well as recon in advance of a mission, but perhaps most importantly in outfitting your planes. The tactics kick as soon as your planes take flight, now you must adjust to unforeseen events, the luck of the dice, and of course carefully maneuver into position to take out your target with the least amount of risk. It is one absolutely fantastic game!

Only just starting playing this, but enjoying the choices you get to make r.e. pilots and ordinance etc, the set up is the really fun part for me. The actual flying part can be pretty tense at times, and hugely frustrating! I like getting attached to pilots over the course of a campaign, and then having those same pilots pop up in later campaigns and remembering how they went last time. Need to set aside some time to play out a whole long campaign, as pilot development will be more interesting rather than just short campaigns. Would be interested to try the Cthulu expansion or Thunderbolt Apache leader, U-Boat leader or the upcoming B17.

It's too bad that the pilots and the aircraft aren't separate cards, as in the later design Thunderbolt Apache Leader - and that due to lack of cover system, the combat is a bit less tactical than in that game.

Never been a big fan of solitaire games, until this system came out. HL: CAO is a great system and what makes this baby tick is the campaign system which gives you purpose for each mission flown. I liked it enough to purchase Phantom Leader when it got it's make over. If your into Air games this one is a must for your collection! What really makes this game fun is the BGG community that supports it. Questions answered, fan based scenarios provided, FAQ's kept up to date, and some great AAR's.

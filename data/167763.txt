Clearly the designers took my opinion of Forever evil and decided they could do worse. Game ran very long for what it was. It is now in competition with Forever Evil for the worst set from them ever (except for Crisis. Which was just awful).

Odd that a set more appealing to younger kids would have more complex card effects.

RATING: 8
Great base game for the DC DBG and the deck cards offer something extremely different. Can easily be mxed with others cards and sorted back out without too much trouble (after playing with this base game, you would want to mix the cards up since some of these are very powerful and useful)

RATING: 8
Might be the weakest set yet, because some of the Hero cards seem redundant, but I was very much looking forward to this and so will happily add it into my DC Deck Building games. It seems the one change here is the presence of more Ongoing card/effects.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I like the added characters. I am not sure how many people will enjoy any of these that do not enjoy the DC theme. The mechanisms are not unique. It is a pretty generic deck builder, but I like the characters and it works well with my friends.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good, very good set BUT buy/play it only if you are already quite familiar with the game and need a twist.
This set is more slow and more combo-oriented so take that into account.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Overall: My personal favorite out of all the DC Base Set, with a large focus on Ongoing effects on cards. Easy to set up combos, and has a nice balance between fun and competitive. Ongoing cards can get out of hand, if someone builds a wall of them, but after a few games it's easy to pick out what to prioritize.

Main Deck: Tons of fun cards that play off one another, though they become slightly less effective in mixed games. Locations felt weak compared to other versions of the game, and there are few Power Creep cards such as Vic Stone, and Teen Titans go! that can make a turn explode.

Super-Villains: Nice set, nothing too crazy. Slade Wilson starter is a nice alternative in mixed games, and can create some broken combos with things like Mogo from Crisis 2. Trigon is one of the first "Final" Super-Villains for the Cerberus engine, cool concept, but I don't think it's been done right as of yet.

Over-Sized Super Hero Cards: All of them, with the exception of the Kid Flash Promo are great in mixed games. Raven is a bit too powerful in the stand alone base set, but the others aren't that far off.

Keep - 2017

One play so far and I spent half the game with only two or three cards per hand because of an odd mixture of ongoing cards that hit every single turn. I stopped even bothering to look at my cards as I drew them as my deck slowly filled with weakness cards from another card that seemed to hit every other turn.

I will definitely try this again, but my first play through was not at all enjoyable.

More for my teenager and her friends.  She has had a mix and boys and girl (Star Wars and DC fans) all together to play the game and they all seemed to enjoy it.  There was a good learning curve for us at the beginning but fun.

RATING: 5.3
My least favorite of all sets.  I love the characters but the cards are underwhelming and so the game seems to take forever since it's hard to generate enough power to defeat the villians. I think they've gone too far in balancing the cards.

I liked this version a lot, I think they put a much bigger focus on combo plays. This set includes my all time favorite DC characters besides Green Lantern. All around just love this.

RATING: 8
Fourth base set of the game, this time focusing on the teen heroes -- including a repeat of Starfire for those who don't have the card from an earlier set. What bumps this set up a bit is the focus on ongoing cards that stay out on top of locations… and most of the small cards end up more useful as a result of them.

PLUS: added mechanic, good assortment of characters
MINUS: needs it own Crisis mode (not all that good with #1 and 2)

RATING: 8
A return to form for the DC Deck Builder. This is probably my favorite set next to the original. The cool/broken combos are back here, and I really like the flexibility of all the heroes. Some ideas feel rehashed, but at this point that doesn't really surprise me. This is just a good, solid set, and I'm glad to see that Cryptozoic isn't running out of gas after a couple of disappointing sets in Heroes Unite and Forever Evil.

Also own the Kid Flash promo.

Enjoyable Deck Builder with the Cerberus system.  Picked Teen Titans as my starter set for DC as I enjoyed the TV Show when I was younger.  I enjoyed it while I had it, but it ended up getting sold when shelf space got thin.  Sold at DTC 2017.

I've loved this series.. I hated this game so much I made an account to write about it. This is by far the worst game in the series. The only thing good about this game is beast boy who is over powered. I have nothing good to say about this game..

See my base deck comment. Mechanically this game seems a little more complex than base, the ongoing cards do have synergy which can string some high combos, but I like the base deck higher +power cards better. 

Will mix with legion

Have played this version a few times. It is not as fun as the other variants. I know it is the Teen Titans which is why they seem weaker than the normal supers, but it does not keep my interest as much.

Obviously get the IP that you like the best (e.g. Naruto or Strret Fighter or whatever) but my kids like Teen Titans. I hate the art though. I wish they had art from the cartoons

RATING: 5
A simple deck-builder. It does a fine job of implementing a changing-market style deck-builder with minimal complications. The gameplay feels like a stripped-down Legendary, which was already too simple for me and lacking in meaningful decisions. The theme is a bit of a mess too, even more so than Legendary, with each player collecting a random assortment of heroes, items, villains, etc. I'd rather play Legendary, and I don't even particularly like that game.

RATING: 6.5
Just okay. I love deck builders but seemed a little too boring and generic for my tastes. I did like it because I like deck builders. It was just a weaker one.

Don't buy this as your first DC Deck-Building set. But if you like the base game, but want more tactical options, then definitely get this one.

This is the only version of the DC Comics Deck-Building Game that I regret buying. It really seems like most of the cards in this set are good supporting cards (like they should be shuffled into one of the other sets) but they really aren't good enough to be a set on their own.

This one is certainly made for Teen Titans fans. There aren't that many notable characters and even the hero cards repeated Starfire instead of Miss Martian who only gets 1 card in the whole set (missed opportunity).

Like the Forever Evil set, Teen Titans adds a new new mechanic by focusing the play on the strategic use of "ongoing" cards.  It really changes up the shoot-first strategy of the other sets and allows for slower-burning, long-game strategy.  I really enjoyed the variation on the game engine and considering how to play my own deck based on what cards the other players were showing--perhaps the best set and gameplay so far in this series.

An improvement over Forever Evil. It focuses a lot on Ongoings, but many cards seem rather parasitic as they only work with ongoings and therefore don't mix in with other sets very well.

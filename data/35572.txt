Lovely bit of Knizia this!  I don't think it's as good as Medici, but that's not the point, is it?  It's nice to have a change and this builds on it both successfully and imaginatively. I like the fact that you have to get one ship to each port and that you should aim to make your fastest boat in the port that you are doing worst in.  I like the arts/arch/science chits and the banners. Lots to think about.  Not so elegant as Medici, but certainly one I want to play a lot.  Gotta try me Medici vs Strozzi.

Enjoyable game with an interesting mechanic.  Can get frustrating when you desperately want a clue of which 'guild' will be influential at the end of the round but no cards come out.  That does my wife's head in and will probably mean the game comes out less and less.

RATING: 4
It takes Medici and makes it worse (less control of auctions - "Oh a nice ship for my strategy just came out, I'll use my 'I win the auction immediately' card, repeat ad nauseum" and have to put a ship in all areas) and I thought Medici was pretty weak.

A retread of Medici with an interesting spin on bidding.  I enjoy it as a lighter game, as it takes the math-iness out of the Medici formula.  But it's not too light.  -1 point for the itty-bitty icons on the cards and tiles...and er, losing the graphic design from the previous two games.

Several elements of Medici are reconfigured.  The auctions are greatly simplified, five commodities are reduced to four (with one gaining a tie-breaker special power)and a set collection element is added.  I greatly miss the angst of Medici's auctions and don't feel as though the other changes compensate.  Still, I'd be happy enough to play Strozzi occasionally.

Production quality is up to Rio Grande's usual good standards.  Most of the artwork is decent, though the board is plain to the point of ugly.

RATING: 7
In the same family as Medici, but rather than bidding points you bid with flags. You have to judge when to bid and when to refrain depending on what ships come up. Quite fast, certainly holds interest, but doesn't set the world alight. Generally, I think I prefer Medici.

It's similar to Medici with players bidding on ships. Each player gets 3 ships per turn guaranteed and players put one ship into each of the 3 ports. They score for relative speed (like the sum of numbers in Medici) and for goods which appear on each ship card (similar to Medici). The bidding is handled with tiles... each player basically has a 2 and two 1's to bid with. If a player bids a 1 then each player after has a chance to take it with a 2. Whenever a 2 (skull) is bid, it wins. The 1 bid tokens have small bonuses for the ships too (either +1 speed or +1 good). It's very Knizia and not terrible. But, I can't say it's better than Medici and I see why it didn't take off. I won't look to play it again, but I would.

Ra-ish Medici. To be honest, in Medici, you typically pass, open the bidding, or bid about 1 more then the current bid. Strozzi streamlines the the process, and keeps the decisions interesting. The art isnt great, but Medici has never looks nice either, so why break the cycle? :)

RATING: 5
The weakest of the trilogy. That said, it's still quite a decent game with some angst and decision making.

Same "Medici" feel but feels more limiting in terms of dynamics of gameplay. Less decision making than Medici. It's either do I want this card or not. You don't make a decision on how much as in Medici.

And as many others have noted, the graphics are not pretty. Wazzup with the cheap looking board?

Based on one play at Essen 2008.

Update: After several plays, its subtleties are coming through. It's still not as stellar as its two predecessors but its replay is better than its initial impression.

Update October 2017. Dropped from 6 to 5. There's a lot of luck in this. Plus I suck at this game.

Not nearly as good as Medici.

Sep 2011:  Rating down to a 6 from 7.   Not sure why entirely, but the game feels a little restrictive in choices.   I think the main problem I have with this one is that the bidding is so binary.   

There are no shades of gray in value, so you can't really have fine tuned control in what you can get -- turn order becomes hugely important.

The tiles that come up and where they come up based on turn order is also very important.    So, I'm not sure how much of this game is actually strategy vs luck.   I did win the last game of this we played, but the game overall wasn't very satisfying.

Strozzi is a half way decent variant on Medici that just isn't as exciting to me.  Some tension is deciding which ships you need to go after and which flag you need to assign to the ships, but I really like the tense auctions in Medici which are missing here.

The tension in this game here is to claim a boat or not. Is one in the hand worth two in the bush? You don't know what's coming up, could be better, could be worse, and you only get to claim three boats per round.

There are multiple ways to get points, so every player, depending on their current board situation, will evaluate boats differently.

Filler. Devoid of any real theme. Typical Knizia scoring mechanisms - 3 varieties of 15/10/5 points (for speed of ships, quantities of goods and bonus goods points) and 30/20/10 points for sets of abstract tiles).

1 play (5p)--different mechanics than Medici, but it does have that feel. But I was expecting it to feel simpler and easier than that game, but it does not! I'd even say the scoring is more complicated (more scoring areas, more ways to score). The board looks less busy than Medici, and that is good, but it's really not less active since you're using the areas to the side of the board. You may have 3 flags but you have a lot more than 3 choices to make per round.  It's tough... I like the role of the Florence track and the set collection. I like how first-come-first-serve breaks ties, and the ceiling on the tracks. But as I'm a fan of Medici, I don't know what I think of this game quite yet.

Easy to learn and satisfyingly quick to play. Scoring system is just like 'Medici' but with decision making in the style of 'Ra' auctions.

I'm working on a couple of variants to extend the play-style to be either more controlled (choice of ships to put up for auction from a hand of 3) or more chaotic (simultaneous closed bids for each ship).  Also looking to include a flag for Vienna so players can dock a 4th ship each round (with payouts being choice of tiles or goods boost).

Strozzi is based on choosing vessels from a deck of cards and then deciding if you want to use them to deliver their goods to a particular port. Each port takes one type of good. You have tokens to add speed, goods, or steal someone else's ship during the round. At the end of the round scores are tabulated based on fastest ship, most goods produced and most prestige.

I only played this once with 6 players.  It was too many for our group, because the turns took long enough that there were continual conversations taking place which slowed down the game play.  But I still liked the game.

It is similar to Medici, but a little easier on new players, because it is easier to understand the value of the ships when you are bidding.

So Strozzi is not very novel, but it is a very good implementation of a (sort of) bidding game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Players try to take control of ships heading to Italy, and direct them into ports that will give them the most profit.  Players on their turn flip up a ship card, which is auctioned once "round the table".  Players have to commit one of their three precious flag tokens to take control of the ship.  The ship is moved into one of three ports and goods recorded on a scoring track for that port.  Bonus goods may be picked up for Florence, as well as arts chips for end of game scoring.  Game is played over three rounds, with payouts at the end of each round for goods monopolies and fast ships.  More payouts at the end for arts chips.  Fun game, basically Medici with the victory point bidding taken out, and Ra sun tile bidding inserted.  This removes some of the anguish, as bidding victory points is a bit like betting money!  Nice game.

Very good game with a lot of tension, a couple of well balanced dilemmas and plenty of interaction. The rules are straight forward. I guess the box and title has disqualified this game from being one of the classic gateway games. That said, it does not work well as a 6 player game. When a player has used up all 3 tokens, he/she may sit inactive for quite a long time.

RATING: 8
Great game, in some respects quite light possibly gateway but more depth lies below the waves that's fun to discover (like how imporant Florence is to break ties). Even people who may not be attracted to auctions may like this quirky system using flags. Only down point is 6 player claim is questionable, I won't be repeating that! Mind you that was my first play. 4 is best I think but 3 is fine.

Strozzi feels a bit like an introductory game to Medici. It reuses many of the same ideas but simplifies the auctions and the lot valuations a great deal. Even though many of the underlying ideas are clearly the same, Strozzi is a pretty good game in its own right. Its target audience is to be found much closer to the family-type end of the gaming spectrum, however.

1 play review with six - it's an ok game, but I'm not sure I would actively request it. Your standard RK stuff - I guess it's strength is that it handles 6 players.  Seems like the strategy is to sacrifice one ware to score better in the others. Maybe with more plays I would give a higher rating. (Rating 6, 2/3/13), UPDATE: Played with 4, it was a much better game.  Very much RK type game, but I like it, its light, and Im happy that the theme.  Happy to play again (Rating 7.254, May 15).

As you can only "steal" one boat per round, I will not say it is about bidding, but selecting the boats as better fit in your plannings

RATING: 7
Ten plays. Basically players are scoring points from ten interrelated contests; three of these score every round but reset at the end of each round, four score every round but players' statuses persist from round to round, and three only score at the end of the game but are worth double. There are three rounds and each round players can claim up to three cards that will help improve their status in two to four of the ten competitions.

The game is fairly interesting; on their turn a player only needs to decide if they want to claim the current ship or not, but the decision can be a tough one because the player will need to evaluate all the competitions that are involved. Dumb luck can occasionally play a role when players turn over cards that are a little too perfect for their situation, but I do feel that there is enough strategy in the game to balance this.

As far as ideal player count goes, I like the game best with four; it moves quickly and there's plenty of drama. The game goes up to six, and at first glance it might seem like a good game for such a large group, since the individual turns are very simple, meaning very little down time. However, with five or six players the display of cards becomes more unwieldy, with the situation becoming extremely hard to parse at a glance, as the owners' flags simply don't stand out enough. Players will also have to keep turning in small coins for large ones during the scoring, which is annoying.

Played twice, once with 5, once with 6. It is very similar to Medici and quiet similar to other Reiner games. The lack of originality makes me wonder if the world really needed this game. I actually do prefer it to Medici but only slightly. Reiner games have depth that I rarely explore and I would rather have not diluted my experience between the 2 different games. If you have not played Strozzi or Medici I would go with Strozzi, if you have played Medici then stick with it and ignore Strozzi. March 11

“Auction” game –without auctions: each player has only three flags, thus three opportunities each turn to get a ship (and only one of those flags allows him to “outbid” another player, and take his ship).

An elegant game that offers some interesting decisions, and is probably more accessible than its older brother –it captures some of the flavor of Medici, but in a more relaxed way (since you don’t have to put a price on an item, just decide if you want to spend a flag on it or not).

Our group loves this game. Simple but so playable. Trying to gain the most points each round also makes it quite a strategic game. Do you pass the card on and give the advantage to another player in the hope something better will arrive. Having limited cards each turn also ups the stakes as well!

Great fun...

Medici is one of a very few Knizia titles that is just a little too spartan for me. Strozzi takes the scoring of Medici and spices it up with some different mechanics. It's not an auction game. It's closer to a drafting game, and I think a pretty good one. We'll see if it's worth delving further.

====

Five years later, I tried this a second time. I'm not sure what happened, but this didn't do much for me on second exposure. Also, I like Medici more now. So... maybe in five years I'll play this again? For now we knock it down a rating point.

Bought for 8 quid in The Works - Bargain!

I chose it blindly (having never played it before) but I was more or less trusting the name/brand and feeling I couldn't go wrong for the price tag... though if I'm honest My brother seems to like Knizia games more than myself, so we'll see

Still very keen to try this

Played it now. I like it I think. Lots of very mechanics to it and only an investment of 45 minutes or so. I wouldn't say the decisions involved are as tough as many other games though

Now owned by Stacey

RATING: 8
Very similar in theme and play compared to Knizia's other games in the trilogy. Ra-like bid mechanic, "have most of" scoring system like many of his other games, and push-your-luck in the draw feel. Feels reminiscent of many of his other games, where a number of mechanics blend together seamlessly. Nice, moderately quick (at 45-60 minutes?) filler, and plays up to 6 players.

Update (04/22/11): Played it again one year later. It's a nice, pleasant bidding game, to gain dominance in one or several areas of influence, along the lines of Merchants of Amsterdam, another Knizia design. Again, he's got some novel ideas that involve multi-variate min/maxing, with equally tantalizing and frustrating choices. I'm thinking of getting this as a moderate-to-light filler, that has more meat behind its simple exterior. I haven't played Medicci in awhile to make a side-by-side comparison, but this one clicks, and hence the '8' still stands.

While this reminded me a lot of medici, I liked it much better than that game.  I am not a fan of once around auctions and this kept that kind of feel but limited the type of bid to keep you from feeling like if you'd just paid a buck more your fortune would be different.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A competent if fairly bland bidding game that would be well respected if it had come from any other designer. However, coming from the mind of Herr Knizia it suffers in comparison to his older and better designs. Unusual in that it plays with six, otherwise you may as well play Medici.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very similar to Medici, but instead of bidding points, you bid with one of three tiles, each of which has a different power.  There are also harder limits on how players are able to redeem their auction winnings.  I think it gets overlooked for being too close to Medici, and I'm not going to claim it's anywhere near as deep, but I enjoyed it. (1 play)

If you decided to turn the elegant but very intense Medici into a more free-wheeling family game, you'd get Strozzi.  And Mr. Knizia has done just that.  Medici is a better game, but I can imagine this actually seeing more play.

Very cool actually, Medici boiled down to a shorter time and one added element with the tiles.  The game seems completely over-balanced, geekbuddies have played it 6 times and it always ends extremely close, nothing wrong with that just an observation.  Same flavour,  about half the time roughly.

About the same as Medici--maybe slightly more intuitive, although this game is "newer" yet not really new at all. 6-player has too much out of your control. But, generally fun, if people keep things moving along. A 7.5 with AP-free opponents, a 3 with the AP-prone.

RATING: 5
A little too subtle, a little too balanced.  The game is about trying to maximize relatively small differences, and about efficiently using the resources you have to put yourself in an optimal scoring position.

The tension isn't strong, because if I stick my goods on a ship I like and someone else uses their pirate on it, there's a good chance that another one that comes around will be just as helpful for me.

Because your bid is essentially a 0, 1, or 2, the tension from forcing the auction value up for another player that wants the load is gone, and entirely replaced with... nothing.

Medici is quite a lot better, I have it rated an 8.

Very much like Medici light.  Top three scores in numerous areas and high score wins.  Not a real brain burner, but some of the decisions to be made in each of the three rounds can get a little maddening.

Because of passing a ship and the 'Pirate' action, there is very little down time, so I'm rating this a 7.

In each of the three rounds of Strozzi, every player has three bid markers to purchase a ship and sail once to each of the three ports. Each ship grants goods, scrolls, technology and a ship value. These items are the input for a three-tiered majority system.

Strozzi is old-school majority scoring with minimalistic auctions. In year 1 after Agricola and year 0 of Dominion it accordingly went under the radar and by now is mostly forgotten. On the one hand this is a pity as it's a good tactical game that easily plays five or six players. On the other hand I don't see much more to discover in future games. Just the usual rule of thumb for majority games: Win where you invest, don't invest where you lose and make some easy points with low investment.

Doesn't live up to Medici, because what game could?  It's very curious as a follow-up to see the auctions pretty much disappear.  The decisions are a little easier since you're not really bidding, but to compensate there are a lot more ways to score points.  The game ends up being much more balanced, perhaps artificially so.  But the possibility of turning up just the right cards and then buying them for 1 because no one else can bid (in Medici) is pretty unbalancing, which I had never thought of until playing this game. 

So I think the time has passed for a game like Strozzi to possibly achieve greatness, but I'm interested in exploring this further to see how it holds up.

Based on 4 players (with 4 & 5 players.)  This is a streamlined version of Medic.  It plays fast.  Last nights play took about 40 minutes and that included teaching to a new player.  The decisions are tough without being overly taxing.  The complaints about board and scoring chips are legit but my guess is that the game would have been more expensive.  I have found it a good deal of fun and would recommend it to those who like game of this genre.

Played first time in Essen 2008. Only a shadow from Medici, BUT still quite fun game. A lot of same Medici-feelings, but the rules strongly minimize your possibilities in every turn - which ruins the game a little bit. And I think the scoring track would be better than those victory point tiles...

A worthy entry in the series. It combines a little Medici, more Medici vs. Strozzi and a simplified Ra where everyone has 3 sun tiles: one '2' and two '1's. So it's not really an auction/bidding game anymore, but you still have lots of things to consider when making decision. Especially as now 'speed' does matter: so while you even have more aims than before, you do have to take 'speed' into consideration as well - it's quite possibly not good to wait for the best ships as you'll be 2nd/3rd... at the same value, thus scoring less.

This is one of those games where you have to decide where to best put resources to be the best in one of a number of different locations, points wbeing awarded at the end of each round for the best in each. Its quite similar to Medici in this respect but possibly not quite as intuitive. The rules are quite dry which makes them quite difficult to follow. The pirate? symbol on one of the auction chits is off putting to some people who seem to think this should do more than just take the boat in question being as they want to impart more theme to that, but since that is the only thematic thing in the whole game that would seem rather too much to me. I quite like this.

Rating could go up. I love Medici so much, it's hard for anything similar to compare. This one is pretty good, though, with some Medici-ish mechanics, but other original ideas. The biggest difference is the departure from victory point bidding in the auction, replaced by bidding tokens that relate indirectly to scoring. I think it's more like Ra bidding with Medici scoring.

08/02/11 Played a six-player game. Strategy takes a backseat to luck of the draw and the wacky turn order. When two of your three bidding tiles have the same value who gets a good ship usually comes down to whomever is lucky enough to bid first. And the right to do that bounces around like a rubber ball. I agree with several gamers who commented that of the three games in this series Strozzi is the weakest. I suppose its worth playing once in a while. But if I don't see it for a year (or two) it won't bother me.

The weakest game of the "Medici Trilogy";  doesn't feel like an auction game.  Players have three tokens to "spend", but the first token placed on a ship claims it unless another player elects to use his pirate token to trump the earlier token.

Players compete to secure ships which provide commodities, civic tiles and scrolls.  Score based on who ranks highest in a scoring category (commodity or scrolls).  Civic tiles are scored only at the end of the game, the other categories are scored after each round.

Not bad, but not great either, an average euro with average graphics.

Possibly my favorite Knizia so far.  The mechanisms are interesting and give enough control over the luck of the ship draw.  There is also plenty of player interaction.  The math-heaviness of Medici is not in evidence, but the game can rest on a razor's edge - I won my last one because I was ahead at Florence.  Plays quickly (75 minutes with five players, two of them novices) and is easy to teach and learn.

RATING: 7
A light Knizia auction game where the action is centred around trying to take control of the best ships on offer and sail them to ports wanting their supplies. 

The auction system is yet another clever tweak on the common format, whereby the players have 3 flags to hoist up a ship's flagpole to capture it. Only one flag type guarantees control of a ship, with the other two able to be beaten by the other players.

All of this action is a means to an end as the players try to position themselves on the various city tracks in order to earn points. Only the top 3 placeholders earn points at the end of each round, so competition is fierce. 

This is a really good game. The theme is somewhat dry and the math shines through, but the gameplay and player interaction is very good. 

Well worth a look.

RATING: 7.3
Auctions with much of the math stripped out, but much of the strategy left in. In typical Knizia style, there's a strong push-your-luck element to the game, as players can only collectively pass three times during a round before someone gets left out without a ship to by. Despite the lack of currency in bidding, valuation of a given ship remains somewhat difficult, which keeps the game from feeling calculable. Plays better with 5-6.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It feels like Medici, but this time the auction currency is not VP/money. Everyone has three tiles which can win a maximum of three auctions. Two of them can bid if nobody bid before, and one can trump the other two if someone else bid one of them. The bidding is for cards representing merchant boats with different speeds, different wares, knowledge and privileges. The maximum of three boats that can be won in a round are assigned to three different scoring tracks, the privileges on them are assigned to a fourth scoring track. Wares and privileges are scored after each of the three rounds, and they are cumulative, just like wares in Medici. Speeds are scored like total boat values in Medici after each round. Knowledge tiles are scored at game end.
Played a six player game and it was ok. Probably it is better with 4 or 5 at the table. There is quite a bit of luck, but I enjoyed the game.

So I finally got to complete the trilogy, 9 years after release. This is probably the pick of them, but I'm not a huge fan of any of them. This is closer to a gambling game. The decision crux is whether I settle on claiming this ship now or wait for something better suited later, and will I be able to claim a better ship if it comes along anyway. Sometimes you get lucky, sometimes not. Like Medici, it pays to focus on specialising on collecting one type of resource for bonus points, so players tend to differentiate themselves and want different things which makes the claiming decision a bit easier, probably to the game's detriment. The rules are easy, and it's decent enough for the occasional whirl I guess, but not something I need. Interestingly, the players at the table who were newer to the hobby all enjoyed it more than I, which I suspect is a function of not having seen the same ol’, same ‘ol as much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Interesting little game with lots of difficult decisions. Playable in little time and I like that players can interfere in each other's game by "stealing" away their ships. I suppose this will get better as you learn how to play since you get more familiar with the ships deck and can speculate on what's coming. Nice first game and was well accepted by occasional gamers. Easy to understand.

RATING: 7
I think this game succeeds as a follow-up/foil to Medici.  You're still trying to achieve majorities in different goods over multiple rounds to score points, with the top spots being worth more.  Ship speed was analogous to the numerical values in Medici; it's a one-time scoring that doesn't accumulate over multiple rounds.  The bidding system is completely turned on its head, though.  Here, you're not bidding with points, you're bidding with bid markers.  The first person that bids on a ship wins it, unless another player "trumps" it with his pirate bid marker.  This makes the game easier than Medici (which I sometimes find too granular), but at the same time makes the bidding rounds less interesting, particularly for people late in the turn order who probably won't have an opportunity to do anything.  It's an intriguing system, but it has its flaws.

On reading the rules it appears to be a quicker and more easy to evaluate version of Medici (though I guess the real strong relation is the scoring method). After looking at the pictures I am concerned that the ship deck is too detailed i.e. ware types are inconsistent with ship speed making it difficult to evaluate and anticipate in your first game, so may cause a ho-hum feeling.

Much better than Medicci. Almost feels more similar to Ra, really, in that you have a set number of ships to win, it's just a question of which ones you want.

RATING: 6
Strozzi was that rare beast: a Knizia game that I wasn’t bowled over by. It’s something of a hybrid of Medici and Ra, taking parts of the scoring system of the former and combining them with a much simplified version of the bidding system of the latter. I don’t think it’s as good as either though. I disliked the way the different components of an auction lot are all just printed on one card, rather than being generated by the players as in both Medici and Ra.

Its amazing how he can keep remaking the same game and yet make it feel new. Its like Medici vs Strozzi for 4 instead of just 2, but different. I really enjoyed my first play and am looking forward to another one. Plays quickly. Has lots of decisions to be made. The final scores were surprisingly tight.

Everything about this game screams, "Knizia!"  It certainly feels similar to Medici.  The bidding is much simpler than Medici.  In fact the first person to claim a ship gets it unless they are trumped by a pirate.

In contrast there are more varied ways of getting points.

I'm not a fan of the pace of the game.  The choices provided certainly involve a bit of thinking, but the choices come at irregular times and have fairly huge consequences.  At times I found myself intensely involved in the game, at other times it didn't even matter than I was there.

Though this game is a bit abstract despite the loosely-applied theme of Italian Renaissance trade, Strozzi is a wonderful game of bidding and counter-bidding for ships. Basically, players try to claim ships based on speed, the amount of three types of cargo they carry, prestige, and special items that garner bonus points at the end of the game.

The game is played in three rounds, but play can be rather intense with the right group of gamers who grasp the simple strategy of getting the most of one good and doing well with two other goods and/or prestige. I'm not sure that this game would be great with younger children because the "theme" isn't that fun and is really flimsy; I mean, you could take the mechanic of this game and apply any trade theme to it. However, if you buy into how scoring is accomplished and recognize that the challenge is in balancing scoring, you would be in for a treat.

Very abstract Euro game, in which you try to gain the majority in 7 different categories over 3 scoring rounds (4 of those categories are persistent while 3 are reset every round) plus a bonus tiles scoring (again majority in different categories) at the game's end. You bid on different available ships (well, the auction is very degenerate), which do well in some categories and bad in others. The essence of the game is to invest in the categories in which you are competitive and ignore the rest. 

The basic mechanism is quite clever and there are some nice decisions to make, but ultimately the game is not really up my alley (not much progress or engine building; very abstract).

Not sure how I feel about this one just yet. Played with a full compliment of 6, and the game seemed to fall flat. I was a little surprised myself, as the rules had me excited to try this. 

As many have commented, Strozzi is a Ra and Medici mash-up. I do agree that description is accurate. It pumps up the scoring elements found in Medici, and then borrows a bidding mechanic similar to the sun tiles in Ra. What you get: a game less than the sum of its parts. The tension and excitement I feel when playing Ra and Medici was nowhere to be found during my play of Strozzi. 

I'd like to try this with 4 players and adjust my rating accordingly. I paid less than $10 for a new copy of this game. I'd be disappointed if I had paid more.

RATING: 8
The easy game of not-so-easy decision making. Short playing time, with experienced players about half an hour. Easy to learn and to explain to newbies. Practically no downtime. Being a true Reiner game, there are many ways to score, but if you succeed in getting the right promotion tiles, you will most certainly win. 

With its refined and straightforward gameplay, it will hit the table certainly more often than the other two Medici games. And regarding the silly complaints here, the board actually looks quite nice and, oh dear, one-sided coins are made so that you can easily HIDE your money. Never mind.

Nice overproduced auction filler game.  Probably, if this design had been made by me it hadn't been published at all, but hey, the author is Reiner Knizia and he can do whatever he wants and still get an editor.  It fells a little bit like [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=80&Itemid=1]Razzia![/url][/i], because players have a set number of tiles to bid and rounds could end with one player pushing his/her luck to get the goods he/she needs.  As normal with auction games, the more players the better.

RATING: 9
This game fired Medici...

Every single turn seemed to have a meaningful decision--and because everyone has a pirate ship, you're constantly engaged on other people's turns because you might want to pirate a ship. Deciding which flag to use, when to use it, where to put the ships, and which bonus tiles to grab was fun and interesting. 

And it seems to scale well.

Never played Medici.  Can't stand Medici vs Strozzi, but had a great time with this one.

Simple bidding game that you can't over-analyse too much and where the 'value' can't readily be calculated which means you can smash this one out nice and quick.  A little Ra-esque.

Ra the Kids' Game, and Ra isn't that complicated in the first place. Much less clever. 3 'claims' per round, and push your luck when it comes to you. Much of the game also rests on hidden scoring, which is a no-no.

The game is more fun but less elegant than Medici. Auctions are reduced to a really simple form which makes them way shorter than those in games like Ra, Medici or Modern Art. The numerous scoring possibilities(7 per round plus one final) create some tough decisions.

1 partial play (Essen '08). Unfortunately, we aborted it: Strozzi has simplified Medici so it's much easier to get into. Unfortunately, this game lacks almost all of the tension in its predecessor! None of us particularly liked the artwork either (sorry, artist guy -- we met him at dinner and he's very nice).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Medici is one of my favorites and I also enjoy the two player version quite a bit.  Strozzi isn't bad, but it falls short of the other two.  I think the main problem is the cards are too balanced.  In Medici, by contrast, you don't usually want the zero or one point card, especially early, but here there aren't many cards that are poor or great, leading to the euro effect of everyone being fairly close in scoring.  Also, the auction element in Medici works great because you're paying with victory points, whereas here you have a weird mix of drafting/auction that isn't very interesting.  All that being said, it still resembles Medici enough that I wouldn't mind playing it now and then.

Medici is the classic of the pair, but at first glimpse I think I like Strozzi better.  Perhaps it's fair to observe that Dr. Knizia has gotten better over the years at making his typically clean designs feel less dry.  However, with six players this seems to manage to be no less tedious than Medici, so I'm lowering my initial rating by a point.

Medici theme & scoring, but the new aspects make it feel quite different. Now timing is important, since tie-breaks are resolved in favour of who reached a score first. The bidding is also totally different. Imagine Ra, where every player starts with a 15 and two 14 tiles, but the two 14 tiles each add a little special benefit when they win.

Great game which grabbed everyone in our group immediately, to the extent that it was all we played over several sessions. It really boils down auction mechanics to their bare minimum - no bidding, just "do I definitely want this, quite want it, or not care?" Beyond the auction, the remaining rules are dead simple, yet provide enough fuel for interaction between the players that it's become a new favourite of mine among our hour-long games.

Calling this Medici with chrome is doing this game a disservice, but there are obvioulsy similarities between the two. There's a bit more going on in Strozzi, and although Medici has been a long-time favorite of mine, Strozzi may eclipse it. Strozzi is vying with Ghost Stories and Diamonds Club as my favorite game of 2008. Balanced, quick, deep and well worth trying. After repeated plays, this has now moved up from an 8 to a 9 in my ratings and is becoming a personal favorite, as well as one that is frequently requested in our game group.

Otherwise, this is a great alternative.

I think it is some different from Medici series. This game is no compare to the weight again, but the speed.

One play, four people, Spiel 08.  I like Medici, and I liked this, but it would seem a better game if its predecessor did not exist.  Three basic goods seems too few, the bid-with-tiles mechanism is less interesting than the Medici bid-with-VPs, and I thought it a curious rule that the person who buys a card gets first bid on the next one, since at times that can be a big advantage. The board is not very functional, and not very attractive.

Strozzi is perhaps the lightest and most accessible among its familiars, Medici and RA, and as a gateway game seems excellent. Is it good though? I can't make up my mind after two plays. The luck of the ship deck is disturbing in theory, but in practice I don't find myself too frustrated by it, and am engaged by the decision of when to commit a bid token or not (particularly the pirate). Rating likely won't rise, but could fall with repeat plays if the illusion of real decisions proves to be too much an illusion.  UPDATE: ratings falls a bit- the game is engaging but in the end I feel like I didn't really make any meaningful decisions.

I did enjoy playing this but see it as a bang-on average game. Very nice components/artwork/setting but central bidding mechanic does nothing special. I did like the simplicity of the scoring it was easy to learn and score in. Would be happy to give it another few goes but not as excited for my next play as I am about another bidding game in my collection (Priests of Ra).

*Update* Substantial increase to score. I had played with an incorrect rule before. Playing it properly now and having played other bidding games I greatly appreciate the simplicity of scoring in this. Means that you can introduce it to players quite easily but still a bit of push your luck and plenty of tough decisions. Impressed.

RATING: 7.5
I enjoyed this one a lot.

It does have a large number of similarities with Medici; however, I thought the replacement of full auctions with a two-tiered claim system (an auction where there are only two levels of bids that you can make) made it play much, much faster than Medici, i.e., everything moved very quickly and it didn't outstay its welcome. The entire 4 player game with setup and instruction was done in 60 mins. I like this. 

I enjoyed the decisions of how-much-do-I-want-this, the fact that once per round if you really want something you can outright claim it and the push-your-luck aspect which comes out if you are the last player or two remaining in a round.

Een heerlijk luchtig biedspelletje.

Spelers bieden op schepen die dan weer snel zijn, maar weinig mee kunnen nemen of langzaam maar veel mee kunnen nemen. Spelers verdienen punten door de snelste te zijn of juist veel van de goederen te verschepen of speciale goederen te verzamelen van deze schepen. Er zijn verschillende wegen naar de overwinning, maar dat maakt het spel er zeker niet moeilijker op.

I understand this is the third in a loose series. I haven't played either of its predecessors, but judged on its own merits, I think it's a very good game, though it might get a bit samey after multiple plays. The "auction" method is very unusual, though it's more of a claim-stake than an auction.

I can't understand why it isn't more popular on BGG; some people dislike the art, though I think it's fine. Maybe it's because I haven't played a lot of other games that use similar ideas, so I haven't become jaded about them.

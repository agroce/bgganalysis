I like the game quite a bit, it's fast and fun and easy to set up, however I do worry about the level of variation in this box alone, since you're playing through the whole deck each time. Works wonderful solo but also is fine with two, have not tried it at higher player counts, there aren't really enough XP coins in the box for more than one person, so you'll need to buy the extra bag or substitute other tokens.

Bought the game because of the Cthulhu theme but soon realized that it was a great solo card game.

Fun card game. Big fan of anything Lovecraft and also a big solitaire gamer, so this game is right up my alley. Can be played with more than 1, but designed for solo play. Would recommend for any gamer who loves Lovecraft and/or plays solo games. Games usually start easy in the first few turns, but can quickly get ahead of you if you do not make right decisions or if you have bad dice rolls. Despite the dice bringing luck, the game is not a luck based game. The decisions you make will ultimately decide the future of humanity.

Played it many times (only solo) and I'm kinda disappointed. It lacks some control and the game is too random. I had high expectation: perhaps that's why i have such a bad feeling about it. Design is not ugly but not good neither. You need a lot of place to play it (more than some other solitaire games). However, the coins are gorgeous and characters give a good replayability. Not a bad game, I like playing it, but I'm a bit disappointed.

* The rulebook is organized, thorough, adequately illustrated and easy to read. It scores an easy '10'.
* The coins and dice are top-notch, too.
* Cards are glossy and a bit thin. I will eventually sleeve them.
* Boards are slightly warped and I'm hoping they don't get worse.
I managed to gently bend the corners backward to alleviate the warping. 
The warping has not been a big deal so far.
8-18-14 warping is no big deal!

* Gameplay is fast and perfect for my solitaire interests!
Four games and one recent victory. 
The game may be too easy with the 4-card draw, so I plan to play some more and see how it goes drawing 5-cards...

Bought this game for the solitaire experience. Although this game supports more players, it is really meant to play solo. It has the right mix of challenge and setup I'm looking.
Setup is a breeze - literally ready in 10 seconds. Other solitaire games I own and like playing I neglect as they require some setup time that I'm too lazy to go through.

I typically dislike dice games, but I decided to give this one a try because I enjoy Cthulhu and solitaire games. It turned out to be mindless and not much fun. For the cost and the lack of leveraging the Lovecraftian theme this is a wide miss for me. It's only marginally more fun than playing solitaire with a deck of cards.

To distill this down to the basic level: there are four enemy factions each with three potential tiers of enemies to fight through. You do the fighting with dice rolls, trying desperately to thin the herd of enemies so you can close a gate. Why the rush? Enemies cannot attack you directly, but horrors sap your sanity for every turn they remain awakened and are a beast to defeat.

The result is a nifty logic problem that moves quickly and gets thorny in the span of just a few cards. However, I would generally not recommend it for the following reasons:

- At $40, it's far too expensive! Yes, the artwork is sumptuous. Yet, here's what you get for that cost: seven (pretty cool) colored dice, four mini game boards that aren't at all required to run the game, 100ish cards, a pile of embossed metal scoring coins (each in individual baggies!) that could have easily been cards or cardboard chits, and an unattractive half-page reference sheet. 

While you can argue that the production values make the game, here the boards and coins are not so amazing that they make me fall in love. They don't add anything to the flat gameplay Nothing about them makes the game play more enjoyable. I would have vastly preferred linen-finish cards.

- The theme is irrelevant. Sure, the card names and items are culled from the Lovecraftian universe and the gates causing more enemies to emerge is thematic. Yet, nothing DOES anything. You could easily rig a way to play this game with two decks of playing cards, using face cards for horrors and aces for gates - you'd only be TWO CARDS off from the enemiy card count and distribution (though you'd need 22 other cards for followers and items).

I don't think every game must guide you by the nose into what's thematic about it, but there is nothing particularly Lovecraftian about the execution. Why don't the different Elder Gods offer some different behavior? Why don't certain minions have requirements like "Must be defeated with one die" on a Power 6, or "Cannot use the spirit die" on a physical slugger?

- The instructions are pretty solid for a Kickstarter game, but have a few weird oversights about combat that make them seem less definitive than they are. 

For example, they never come right out and say, "Your roll can be used against awaken horrors, minions, and sleeping horrors all in the same combat, if you defeat each group in that order."

- The strategy of deciding how to allot your experience in each turn doesn't overcome the random-on-random element of blind deck draws plus dice rolls.

Again, some uniqueness to the enemy factions would slightly alleviate this.

I don't really like the structure of the game, And I was not expecting for it to be a dice game. One drawback seems that the card shuffling could lead to easy or impossible games randomly.

Cthulhu won't let me stop playing. I feel like I need to link the results for each investigator into a campaign somehow.

Base rules are a bit too easy and you'll probably win 4 out of 5 with a four card draw (still fun though and probably the best way to start out). I've long since switched up to a five card draw, and also discarding any items/followers drawn after the first one (no xp, just discard and draw another card). I figure you'll be fighting to get 2 games out of 5 with those changes.

RATING: 6
a nice solo game, but without the expansion it is too easy and too repetitive.  It's good for a few plays, but then (even if you dial up the difficulty in the ways the designer has suggested) it needs something more.  But it did intrigue me sufficiently to buy the expansion, so I will attest that it is a solid core of a game system.

Like Arkham Horror, the arc of tension is completely wrong thematically.  You start off on the verge of death, then get control of the situation and by the end (if you win) are running the field with little risk to yourself, taking on incredible horrors with no risk.  I'd much prefer a sense of growing dread rather than growing security.

Update:  THE EXPANSION SOLVES ALL THOSE PROBLEMS, BOTH MECHANICAL AND THEMATIC!

This is a very solid, light Cthulhu-themed dice/card game.  Cool interplay between the investigators and the boards and I really like how wounds cost you dice.  Some powerful combos become apparent very quickly and knowing the deck doesn't hurt, especially knowing that there are only so many horrors, items, etc. left.  This is a minor quibble as is the fact that you see all of the cards - a personal pet peeve of mine.  Otherwise, it's quick, easy-to-learn and can be completed in 20-25 minutes once you know what you are doing.  An expansion providing a little more variety in cults or adding cards without increasing the deck size so you aren't sure what's coming would be a major score and would likely increase my rating.

About [thing=145642][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=145642][/thing] is a card game about tableau management and dice rolling, focused in solitaire play. What it isn't is a truly thematic game, having just a small use of the theme throughout the plays - it is mostly an abstract affair.

There is little control and a big amount of luck - from the roll of the dice to the draw of the cards. The evolution is also small: the same thing you do early on, is the same you will be doing later, and while the stakes could be higher, not even this is a sure thing, as the challenge is low, even when drawing 5 cards per turn (a variant proposed in the manual to increase difficulty).

The production value is very good: the art is excellent and the metal coins to mark experience are really well done, as well as the dice. Though the boards for the Cults are also fine, the size of them make the whole box much bigger than it needs to be, which is a bummer, but can be proper with expansions.

Though the manual does a fine job in explaining the rules, it lacks in some corner cases, specially in the use of special abilities.

Overall, [thing=145642][/thing] left the bitter taste of disappointment in my mouth: a thin theme. no arching story, and often really easy to beat - this could work in a 30 minutes game, but with twice this, [thing=145642][/thing] simply isn't worth it.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Player starts with 4 experience and picks one character to be represented by. Then, each turn, the player draws 4 cards from the Cult deck. Minions are put in the indicated cult board (there are 4, distinct by color and symbol); the same is valid for the Horrors, but they may be asleep, as they required a number of Minions to awake them (2 for Minors, 3 for Major, and 4 for Unspeakable) - if there are awake Horrors, the investigador suffers Sanity damage, which is paid by spending experience or discarding a Follower. If a card is a Gate, is it put in the proper cult board and immediately increases the number of cards drawn each turn until it is closed.

If one or more of the cards revealed are Followers and/or Items, the player can take them, usually by paying an amount of experience. If the player can't, or don't want to, for each discarded Follower and/or Item, the player receives 1 experience.

After drawing, buying, checking to see if a one of more Horrors awake, and suffering the Sanity losses, is time to Combat. The player picks a cult board and use, normally, three dice to battle. It is possible to pay for extra dice - the Spirit dice. Once the roll is done, the player can re-roll, except dice that rolled 1. If the Body die (red one), rolls a 1, the player loses one Health die (green) or must slay a Follower. If the player ever loses both Health die, she loses the game.

Then the dice are used to defeat Minions and Horrors - Minions only required the number on them to be reached by the use of one or more dice; the Horrors, if asleep, only demand a certain number of dice (from 2 to 4), no matter the numbers on them - but if awaken, the Horrors required combos of 2, 3 or 4 dice, be numbers in sequence or dice with the same number, and this is harder to achieve since the Horrors, the stronger they are, more dice they can lock and prevent from re-roll. Experience is gained equal to the number of Minions defeated and/or equal to number of dice demanded by the Horror to be destroyed.

Awake Horrors protect Minions, and Minions protect Gates. To close a Gate, the cult board must (usually) be empty of Minions.

The player can use Magic Spells, by paying experience, and they are: Spirit Die (1 xp per die); Healing (3 xp - regains a Health die); Hurry (2 xp - allows a second turn of Combat); Seal (3 xp - closes an unprotected Gate).

The game ends in defeat if the character dies (loses both Health die), or gets insane (must lose Sanity and can't slay a Follower or pay the experience cost), or, after the Combat phase, a cult board has 5 or more Minions: they awake the Great Old One and the world is doomed. The player wins if the above didn't happened by the end of the cult deck, and if there are no awake Horrors on any board - though no more cards will be drawn, play continues until all the awake Horrors are defeated, or the character goes insane or dies.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
All are simple and straightforward:
- Which cult board to attack: normally it is pretty clear where things are worst. But there are some points to consider: the presence of a Gate; how close one or more Horrors are to be awaken; the overall strenght of the Minions; and the special abilities and actions allowed by the character, Followers and Items;
- What to buy: from Followers and Items to the Magic Spells - but some, when allowed and possible to be paid, tend to be given, such as Seal an unprotected Gate;
- When/if use a special ability or power of an Item: many have a cost, and it must be weighted against other options for the experience to be used.

Though by reading is possible to think the decisions have many branching considerations and can be hard to be taken, this isn't true in most cases: the boards states and situations usually give a clear picture of the necessities, making the decisions easy enough to be made more often than not.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Great production value, specially the metal coins;
- Though primarily made for solo play, it allows for cooperative and competitive play;
- Easy to teach and to play.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Sizeable downtime if playing with 3 or 4;
- Often too easy to be beaten, even with increased difficulty;
- Mostly composed with obvious decisions;
- Too big of a box, for the most part  filled with air;
- Only slightly thematic - no true story to tell.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Simply wanting for more. I want more theme, more decisions, more of a horror story and a memorable experience to tell afterwards. The theme is barely there: the cults aren't differentiated and even use the same Minions - Deep Ones, Shoggots, Leng Spiders and others show up in all of the cults, and their function is more in line with cards in a common deck, with the difference of a 5 and other 5 being color and suit. Even the characters, which can be easily turned into a proper person, with the simple addition of a name, a backstory, are only given a function: the Doctor, the Soldier, the Big Game Hunter... no, wait, I'm being unfair: it isn't "the", as this could be too unique and close to a thematic flavor, it is, in fact, an "a": a Doctor, a Soldier, as the Followers are the same characters, and thus, there are two of each.

Yet, all of this could be put in second place, if the gameplay was rich, enthralling, filled with options and decisions, or tense and dark. But [thing=145642][/thing] isn't these things. It is a simple game, almost abstract in nature and mechanics, with a small set of rules. Turns are often quick, but the game isn't short: around 45 to 60 minutes. And while the time doesn't normally gets bigger with more players, the amount of time you will be playing will drop, the more players are added.

I saw that some of my complains are adressed by the [thing=192896][/thing] expansion, which differentiates the cults and bring some mode of plays that can allow for more unique plays. However, as a base game, [thing=145642][/thing] fails in more points than it succeeds, and one shouldn't need to seek for expansions to find some solutions to problems the game shouldn't have in the first place.

In the end, [thing=145642][/thing] doesn't truly offends, but is simply a weak offering and the Ancient Ones will likely eat your existence away if that is all you brought. Not recommended.

Lovecraftian themed solitaire filler that plays really fast. It's an OK game that's enjoyable in the right circumstances when you are up for some nice and easy mindless fun. Gameplay is very random and I found the game to be not very challenging. Although this is a solitaire game, you also have the option to play it cooperative with up to four players. I would never play it any other way than solitaire. I would rather they had one big board instead of the four smaller sized, but this is only a small gripe I have. I believe I read somewhere this was a design choice so that you will be able to add more enemy types in an eventual expansion. [I]With extra Bonus Pack (7 custom dice and 10 extra coins).[/I]

Purchased for solo'ing. After first few plays it is highly luck of the draw, mostly plays itself, and success hinges on getting the sword early. But, if you want brainless, it can still be fun and thematically engaging artwork.

I find this a very tense game ... quite fitting for the theme, don't you think?

Matryoshka presents an interesting twist on set collecting and trading.  The first part of that is the escalating number of cards you have to reveal at the end of each round.  Ideally, you want to provide helpful hints about cards you desire, without causing alarm at the size of the sets you already have.  This gets progressively more difficult towards the end as almost everything in your hand is part of a valuable set and you want to keep what isn't valuable in your hand in order to trade it away.  

Then there's the trading itself, in which you'll sometimes want the card the active player is offering less than anything you are holding.  You find yourself wondering which card they are sure not to pick.  And when something juicy is put up for trade, you'll ask yourself if the good card you're about to offer in exchange will give your opponent more points than you're set to gain, wracking your memory for the cards they have previously shown.  Matryoshka extracts a fair bit of fun from a deck of cards, a short rules set and a playing time of less than 30 minutes.

Production quality of the cards in my White Goblin deck is good.  The artwork is eyecatching, though as others have said, the background colours of the suits could have been much better differentiated.   Also, the swirly patterned background on the player aids wasn't a good idea.  The English rules are OK.

Interesting mechanics for this short and fast game.  The exchange system (current players offers a public card, rest of the players offer hidden cards), and the collection system in which each turn you show more of your collection, are quite nice and work well.  Graphic design is superb, matryoshkas are really nice.  The only drawback I see is that since they are 10 different designs, and the colours are not that different (there are 4 different kinds of blue...), it is not extrange to make a mistake.
Quite refreshing filler.

This might be rated more highly if the cards didn't all look so similar, making the game a bit of a chore to play.

Kaartspel met erg mooie poppetjes.
Je zoekt rijen/kolommen van kaarten met dezelfde figuren of getallen.
Maar je ruilt en onderhandelt met de andere spelers om de goede kaarten te krijgen.
Goed te spelen voor een 8-jarige.
Een goed geheugen kan helpen, maar toch lijkt het me veel geluk.

Surprisingly enjoyable set collection game. It's achievement comes through negotiation and tough decisions about what you decide to show to your opponents. You want to misdirect and not lead them on to what sets you are going for but it's difficult. It gives the game a sneaky, bluffing element that injects some suspense and heightens the overall experience.

Maybe we are just the ideal people for this game, but man do we love it.  

Not a fan of the backs (wish they had made them look like stylized card backs) but I love the art on the face of the cards, and personally really like the color choices.  Trading is a big part of this game so there is a lot of negotiation and the fact that some of the colors make it so you can be confused is sort of a plus in that regard.  Although my father in law legitimately has a hard time keeping track of 'suits' at times, so if your eyesight isn't the strongest, that's something to consider.

This game is so satisfying though.  It reminds me of lost cities or arboretum, but it's a little less thinky and theres a whole lot more wheeling and dealing.  IT also reminds me of Bohnanza on that regard.  But for some reason, the theme really works for me here.  

You do get obsessed with collecting a particular set of dolls, which really makes you feel like you are a Russian doll collector at a convention, trading with other obsessed Russian doll collectors.  And even I lose, I feel satisfied with how complete my collection is.  

The game is super simple but somewhat brilliant IMO.  Nice blend of trading, hand management, bluffing, deal-making, memory, card-counting, with a splash of push your luck!  Love it.

Cards are already starting to wear from play so I am going to need to sleeve it, which is too bad because it won't fit back in the box and it will lose a little bit of the deck of cards feel.

Oh well, it's worth it because we love this game.

The theme of Matryoshka is irrelevant but the gameplay is really enjoyable. The mechanics of showing what cards you're interested in and then trying to entice opponents to give you what you want makes for a lot of interesting decisions. The downside is the hidden information means you can sometimes accidentally help a player. One barrier to entry is the scoring is not easy to grasp at first glance.

This has moved to the top of my want list to add to my collection of easy to teach card games that have interesting decisions.

Alright filler, with very simple mechanics of set collection and trading. Completely abstract. It loses one point for the awful choice of background colors, with four similar shades of blue that cause a lot of confusion.

This was ok and the trading mechanism actually kind of good. But all in all, it was too dry for my tastes. Not a bad game, but it doesn't stick out enough to keep it in my collection.

Very cute and playable game with cards that have awful color/graphic design. (The Matryoshka dolls are adorable but the symbol and color choices for card suits are hard to tell apart/not color friendly.) I am likely to play this in the future with Arboretum cards [you need up to 10 suits numbered 1-7].

So it's sort of like one of those games [like Arboretum or Lost Cities] where you have a small hand of cards and you want to keep all of the cards [but you must always engage in the trade phase]... but different in that at the end of the game, all of your cards [except 1] will be scored for points. What matters are your sets you've managed to collect by then.
During the game, part of your "hand" will be on display in front of you. So you are leaking some information--but you got to be careful about what kind of info you are leaking. If it is obvious you desperately need a particular card, you may not get it. Or likewise, if you notice someone is collecting a particular type of card, you can offer it during the trade phase to see if they offer something nice in return.

I found the gameplay very clever, the negotiation is neat and I loved the art. However this game has a production flaw, the suits are very difficult to differentiate. You have to pay extra attention, it’s a shame because the illustrations are awesome. Overall I liked this game.

1 partida en Jesta 2017.

Tienes que formar filas de números consecutivos del mismo color o columnas del mismo número. En cada turno el jugador activo ofrece 1 carta al resto de jugadores que ofreceran otra suya, buena para él o no, en función de cuánto les interese conseguir la suya.

Juego muuuuy típico, que lo único nuevo que aporta es lo de la "puja" y que, encima, cuando ya tienes todas o casi todas las cartas que te interesan, lo único que haces es perder una que ya tenías "colocada" u ofrecer siempre la misma porque las demás ya no quieres deshacerte de ellas. Para más inri, los colores de las cartas se parecen demasiado y prestan a confusión constantemente...

But I found this game a complete waste of time.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Interesting but odd. I also don't like how the different suits are differentiated - at first I thought color could be of use, but you really need to focus on the doll type involved to tell the suits apart and ignore the background color where shades are often quite similar/same as other suits. Game play is different - you are seeking to collect sets that are grouped together as much as possible in your tableau which you only show a portion of each of the first three rounds until your final show and scoring. The trading mechanic is odd too - you put out a doll on your turn and everyone else puts one out face down and you look at each and select one and that person receives the doll you put out face up.

Gorgeous artwork on every card! A lot more going on in this game than what first appears on the surface. Definitely don't advertise your whole end game plan in terms of which cards you put out, as this is another tactical layer in negotiating to get the cards you want. At first, we all thought the game was rather simple. By the end, we saw the unique quality and depth.

Wir alle sind Sammler von Matroshkas (russische Puppen die ineinandergestapelt werden können). Jeder legt bei Spielbeginn 2 Karten offen vor sich aus. Innerhalb einer Runde muss jeder Spieler eine Karte offen anbieten und erhält von den restlichen Spielern ein verdecktes Gebot (Handkarte). Eine dieser Karten muss er annehmen. In den Folgerunden müssen immer mehr Karten offen ausgelegt werden (man gibt immer mehr von seiner Sammlung preis). Nach 4 Runden gibts Punkte nach einer Matrix.
Sehr nettes kleines Spiel, erinner ein wenig vom Gefühl her an Arboretum.
Gefällt mir ;).

tl;dr: enjoyable card game

This is one of those abstract card games that are a dime a dozen. In essence it's a numbered-color-cards game but this one has a slapped on theme to grab your attention. I'm not sure it adds anything, but it is a very playable and rather enjoyable game. I'd be glad to play it again, but despite the theme it doesn't really stand out a lot.

I really enjoyed this one.  There's quite a tricky balance between deciding which cards to display and which to hold back, especially in later rounds when so many cards get displayed and your small hand of held cards must also be used for bidding.

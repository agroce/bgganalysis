RATING: 8
Magnificent game, simple, intuitive mechanics, climactic, the outcome ranges from disaster to small defeat for the south and so there is no victory per se but it makes it more historical and thematic, definitely interested in seeing more historical battles with that system (Death or Glory). Victory Point Games never disappoints!

When I heard "Press your luck" I was thinking it was in a Yahtzee type of way, but it is not.  You advance and as you get hit, you either have to pause, rally, and regroup or keep pressing on, risking a rout and causing all of your gains to be for not.  The topic would be tough to make a game about, but this pulls it off well and is really fun.

Very engaging push youre luck. I’m a huge fan of can’t stop but also a fan of mostly heavy boardgames like pericles, through the ages, etc. This games manages to tell a story with a very light gameplay. Yes, there is not much of desiscion making here but the choices do matter and are compelling. Love this for what it is.

RATING: 8
Typical Victory Point Game for the light wargamer who wants to have fast fun in an historical setting. Certainly not a heavy weight wargame, but LOTS of Flair and so much love for an historical Charge at Gettysburg.

It is a pure push your luck game but so smartly packaged into an historical context.

I love it, but 8 is the absolute maximum as you can't compare these things with deeper competitive games or some heavy thematic time passings.

Better than most games on BGG while not being a pretentious effort, it succeeds in giving the solo player a great little time of around 60-90 minutes.

Solo play makes it a game to enjoy whenever you want.

Not so much a game as a superb 'narrative engine' that captures the story of Pickett's charge in a simple, neat little 'push your luck' game. Features and chrome abound to mask the simple engine in enough 'colour' to capture the feel of this famous action. You get enough player actions to give a semblance of control in a chaotic siuation. Brigades charge under fire and balance advances with regrouping to avoid a precipitous rout. Event chits scatter advantage and disaster across the battlefield, while your brigades haemorrhage strength as they advance to melee. The unknown Union strength through those unrevealed Fire chits add a lovely touch. In my first game, we had captured 3 positions and were contesting a fourth when Lane's brigade, disgraced in an earlier rout, charged again and rushed the length of the field on a series of perfect die rolls. Reaching the final space, their luck ran out and they ran into heavy fire at maximum distance from their rally chit, and the little band disappeared from sight in a single volley. Director yells 'Cut', cue haunting music, credits roll. A triumph.

RATING: 6
A simple press-your-luck game with a few interesting decisions.  The mechanics, however, are a mismatch for the theme, disregarding divisional cohesion and unified action and rewarding rushing lone "lucky" brigades headlong into enemy lines as quickly as possible.  It all just feels wrong for 19th century combat.

The result feels more like WWI trench-warfare.  Perhaps that is a direction future games in the series will explore, and perhaps those future games will be more compelling.  For now, however, the whole thing falls a bit flat.

This is a fun, easy and addictive solo game. I tell people it is "Can't Stop" with a theme! I really enjoy pushing my luck (and my troops) charging towards the line!

The solo player sends Longstreet's division against Cemetery Hill, during the Battle of Gettysburg, July 1863.  Fun game where the player activates nine brigades of Confederate infantry, in any order they wish, and sends them up their column of spaces against the fixed Union positions.  Each time they get to activate they can either attempt to move, or consolidate their gains.  Movement is via a die roll, which generates one of 36 results (each of equal probability).  You quickly learn that 1's are bad, 6's are wonderful, and doubles range from catastrophic to euphoric.  The player has five turns to get their brigades across the open ground, over obstacles, and into the Union positions in an attempt to capture them.  The game (Union) fights back via a cup of chits that throw all sorts of nasty stuff at the Rebels - artillery, volley fire, etc, which whittles down the brigade strength.  After five turns, your gains are scored to determine victory.  This is a very fun, push your luck die roller, but with a terrific sense of theme and "experience".  The player is given some tactical options, such as the order in which you advance, the use of special Lee and Longstreet chits, etc.  The game looks daunting, but plays like a dream, and even the die roll matrix is quickly internalized.  Fun stuff - I can see this being the beginning of a long series of games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting push-your-luck style wargame, with the player trying to get as many brigades across the picket line and destroy the enemies who are camped there. Very luck reliant, with a (very) few mechanics that allows for re-roll. Main meat of the decision making is based on "do i roll once more and risk it, or do i stop".
interesting for a quick game (30 minutes max).

Herman Luttman seems to favor difficult to game situations, and Pickett's charge is definitely one of them.  This is a REALLY FUN solitaire game that I've already played about a dozen times; it's one of those where you almost never win but feel like you will with just one more try.  Rules are easy, game is nice to look at.  Note: As much as I enjoyed this game, I decided to sell it.  After probably a dozen plays I had definitely got my money's worth, but didn't feel that there was anything more to learn or get from it.

RATING: 8
This one shocked me, I actually believe it does a real good job of telling the story of Pickett's Charge. Some folks may want to believe that it's just a dice fest but the strategy of regrouping and using Lee, and Longstreet, as well as your divisional commanders to maximum effect is really what this game is about. Is there luck involved sure. Is it just rolling dice and checking charts? Not really.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An intriguing concept, but one that does not hold up.  Like the States of Siege system, which is a kind of "cousin" of this system, it has some serious issues with the skill vs luck dynamic, with luck strongly winning out here.  I'm not committed for or against the "system" at this time.  However, I found the decisions here just lacking and the historical narrative preposterous.

Paid it Forward

Nice game with enough variety to play the game repeatedly. And the game has rules for 2 players. The soot on the counters is very annoying. Rules: 3 (1-3); Components: 2 (1-3); Fun/Replayability: 3; Solitaire: 1 (0-1).

RATING: 7
Really like this little push your luck game. Some neat ideas in this game and the chit pull system is vicious. Really get a feel for the withering fire those Rebs faced assaulting Cemetery Ridge. 

Had the honour of walking the field of battle this last April and getting to the Emitsburgh road from the confederate start off position was long and hard enough; but when you get to the road and look toward the copse of trees you realise just how devastating incoming fire would have been from that point in. I was surprised at just how close the road actually is to the Angle but, it must have been pure carnage!

The one thematic point that I am less happy with is the fact that your units can get pushed back to the start and then they can start over again effectively rallying, reforming and starting out again all-be-it in damaged state. That's the one thing that I just can't quite visualise happening, works as a game but, I really don't think anyone would have wanted to go out on to that ground a second time!

Still a great game that is sobering to play out.

Overall I'm a fan of most of Victory Point's solo games. In Magnificent Style follows suit as it is easy to learn and relatively fast to play with a small footprint. I skimmed through the rule book once and then kept it next to me to reference. There's a useful players aid that has most of the rules on it.

As I've grown accustomed too with many of VP's games the components are very nice with thick counters and the graphics look good.

The game is challenging enough to keep me coming back. The first couple play throughs didn't end so well (although I received a historical outcome). The biggest decisions were whether or not to continue pushing my batallion lines forward. 

Fun little game. Easy, light, quick...I'd recommend it if you like solitaire wargames or historical games.

A mindless-forward charging ("Picket's Charge") to the Union line at Gettysburg.  Note to self: as other BGGers point out, this game can't be called something like a simulation thus far.  It is only a fun game to play disguised as wargame. I have to think about it before buying it.

I love Victory Point Games but hated this game. I was so excited for the concept and blown away by the production quality but found the gameplay boring and repetitive. It's basically roll and move... Roll 2 dice and look up the result on a chart. You roll dice and look up the result over and over and over. Once you get into close combat you have basically no choices to make?

I really hoped this would be the perfect lite war game but the choices the game offers just arent that interesting. A war game focused on push you luck mechanics should be pure gold but this just doesn't pull it off.

[microbadge=1714]

[u]12-Jun-2016[/u]:  In Magnificent Style is a historically themed game, depicting Pickett's Charge at the Battle of Gettysburg, during the US Civil War in 1863. You control nine Confederate Brigades, separated into three Divisions, as they charge forward into Union territory. Each Brigade advances forward in it's vertical column on the game's map via a press-your-luck dice mechanism reminiscent of the classic game, Can't Stop. You'll also be pulling random event chits both for the Confederates and the Union Units, deciding where to lay down fire, which Brigade receives reinforcements, and where & when to use the General of each Division. You must capture as many Union positions as possible under heavily unfavorable odds.

Okay, there is a lot of dice rolling in this game. Like a lot, a lot. And duh, right?! It's how the game is designed. You roll to advance each Brigade and then roll again. And then again. And keep rolling until you decide to stop pressing your luck or until you're forced to stop by some specific result of the dice. With nine Brigades each needing to travel ten spaces on the map, that's ninety dice rolls right there.  The game is pretty light on the complexity and gameplay scales. And that's not necessarily a bad thing, but after two hours of rolling dice, I wanted more to do. 

With all that being said, I would like to give kudos to Mr Luttman for this game's design. It truly does integrate theme and game mechanisms into a wholly realized, historical experience. I had a couple YES! moments (but could have used one or two more) and a handful of NO! moments to boot. Moments I felt the need to stand up and witness from above. Feeling the desperation...the need...to just reach the Union's position at the end of the line, even though I knew it meant certain death. And that feeling of exhilarating depression, knowing that I was finally able to capture a Union position...but only at the expense of my entire Brigade of soldiers.

I am not a history buff, and therefore I am not knowledgeable on the details of this particular battle beyond its very basics, but I leave my first session of the game feeling like I know it. And that is certainly an achievement by the designer and one I would hope any historically themed game would provide me. The game integrates theme and game mechanisms wonderfully. It's light on the decision making, allowing the player to witness much of the action while interjecting small, but potentially important, choices here and there. If it would come in around the 30-45 minute mark, it might be one of the best games I own. But longer than that, and I'm not sure it's in my wheelhouse.

RATING: 9
What a game! This system is very clever and brilliantly simple. It allows you to get a real feel for those terrible minutes where the charging rebels faced such horrific combat. Yet, I found myself egging them on, to try and reach the Union lines.

I found myself really getting into the process as the tension rose with each unit that I activated. Its very interesting to follow how each unit moves towards the Union line. Will they make it? Its hard to tell. At first, I wasn’t convinced about moving one unit at a time, across the ground, as it seemed so unrealistic but I soon realized that, of course, they were all moving simultaneously, but the only way to manage this was individually as a game mechanic. I also thought that there was a tabletop miniatures feel to the actions and I was very happy with it.

The Event chits add a lot of the feel for the situation and there are enough to keep things fresh and up for numerous plays. Rules for Generals, Bayonet combat, Hits and Regrouping all add a tabletop miniatures add a great feel and yet it feels simple throughout the game. A wonderful example of design for effect over design for heavy detail.

I have to say that In Magnificent Style, is a very imaginative design. It is evocative, fast playing, exciting, nerve-racking and fun. One of the most interesting designs that I have come across in a very long time. The linear feel for the game is, on the one hand, frustrating, but its important to understand the context. This is a brutal affair which happened in a short amount of time so it needs to be linear. Yet there is a lot of variety in the story of events thanks to the event chits.

This is the ultimate push-your-luck game as you are continuously asking yourself how far you can go, when do you regroup, and you have plenty of choices, depending on what kind of fire your units are taking.

The only downside, for some players, may be that after repeated plays, it may seem repetetive. Doesn’t bother me, but it might bother some.

Overall, I would have to say without reservation, In Magnificent Style, is done in magnificent style and should be a must-buy for war gamers, particularly those who are interested in the Civil War.

Magnificent job, Hermann Luttman and Victory Point Games!

This game has nice components that create a good feel for the theme, but is way to dependent on luck of the die rolls.  I have played it 6-7 times and have done well, lousy, pretty well, disastrous, etc.  It doesn't seem to allow the player to have very meaningful decisions.  It all will come down to the die rolls. The games that I did real well in were still not satisfying because it was the good die rolls that made all the difference.  It feels almost like competing in a basketball game and no matter how many baskets you score or how well or how badly you played, after 3O minutes  stopping the game and then making a die roll to see who wins.  Most wargames use dice, but this one seems so much more dependent on the die rolls than the decisions the player makes.  I enjoy the States of Seige Series from VPG, for example, even though there is lots of die rolls to make.  You still feel as if you have some ability to plan and make good decisions that may overcome some bad rolls.  Not so in this game.  All planning can go out the window with a few disastrous die rolls, or the opposite might be the case, when even shoddy decision making is overcome with lucky rolls.  it just seems so arbitrary.  That being said, I am not sorry I purchased this game.

Incredibly frustrating dice fest.  Does mimic the problems that the Confederate forces had on July 3rd 1863.  Beautiful thick chits, but very little strategy or tactics.  If you roll well, you will be successful, If not, well 'General Lee - I have no Division'.

I had always wanted to play the third day scenario when I had TSS. (I sold my TSS after I got GMT's Three Days at Gettysburg.) I never got to. It may not be the ultimate simulation of Pickett's Charge due to the luck factor but does somewhat satisfy my desire to play the third day. I would recommend it to both wargamers and non wargamers. If you don't like a lot of dice rolling or roll and move, you may not like it. However, I found it quite fun to play. Herman Luttmann did a wonderful design.

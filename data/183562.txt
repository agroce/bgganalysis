Świetna gra w uniwersum Gwiezdnych Wojen, ale spodoba się ona również i osobom których nie miały z sagą nigdy do czynienia.
Świetnie wykonane modele oraz bardzo dobre malowanie figurek. Bardzo ładnie prezentują się na biurku. 
Jeden podstawowy zestaw bardzo szybko przestaje wystarczać osobom które złapią bakcyla. Posiadanie dwóch podstawek jest raczej naturalną sytuacją dla każdego gracza więc problem braku wystarczającej liczby kości szybko przestaje istnieć.
Gorąco polecam i radze uważać na swój portfel, bo gra strasznie szybko zaczyna wyciągać z niego dodatkowe pieniążki :)

So far have only played on 'easy mode' with the kids (no actions or upgrades.) They like the ships and we all have a good time. I could see the rating climbing higher with future plays that use the full rules.

Have three copies of the FA Core that I got when Target put them on 70% clearance.

Originally I passed on X-Wing because of the implied costs, and then went for Armada, but once I actually saw I could put together a decent squadron at a low price, I've decided to swap back to X-Wing. I prefer the tighter intimacy of this and it's dogfight feel, even if there is arguably a more tactical game in the other.

A simple miniatures game with great pre-painted models (although I despise the fragile little stands - FFG could do better imo).

The game itself is a fun romp that doesn't demand too much from players and lasts an enjoyable amount of time. It's expensive for a game of it's type, but the models are very nice.

Great game.  I strongly recommend playing this prior to buying Star Wars Armada.  The core set is less expensive, and the rules overlap enough, though not entirely, to provide a good indication of the longevity for a more involved, more expensive version of a similar game.

Rating for the entire game [family=18113]family[/family]. This deviates from my normal policy to rate base games and expansions separately, but I think the X-Wing base games just can't sensibly be rated without their expansions. They obviously weren't designed to be played with just a base game.
My rating contains a sizeable bonus for the existence of a large official, well-organized tournament scene, the fact that the official FAQ is updated regularly and that FFG is not afraid to change cards that turn out to be too weak or particularly too strong.
I would like the game considerably better if movement and check for viable targets were based on hexes (or squares) instead of the fiddly and imprecise maneuver templates and a line laser.
Moreover, expansions are published too frequently for my taste: The meta changes too quickly and it is too expensive to stay competitive.

This needed to be X-Wing 2.0.  The attempt was made to re-invent the damage deck, then replace the T-65 with an X-Wing that is better in every regard, and then add a pilot that makes sure Luke Skywalker is killed from the meta.

I don't think they had a choice, but this really should have been pushed to a new era since technically the factions are different.

I would revisit this score if they due separate First order and resistance down the line but I'm not holding my breath.

A fun and fast dog-fighting simulation. It is a bit ameritrashy with the dice rolling, so don't take it too seriously as a few bad rolls can ruin the best tactical move.

But I love trying to outguess my opponent and maneuvering my ships in the best position. It does a great job of putting you into the cockpit.

Would give it a higher ranking, but storage is a little annoying so i gave it a 9.  Then getting people to play that are not crazily into it to where they have everything ever made of it...that is a challenge. The components are awesome, but difficult to keep all together unless you spend too much money for a specialized container.So the fiddliness and some aspects of the community make this game harder for me to play...so I gave it an 8.

Pros:
- outstanding miniatures
- simple rules, easy to teach, easy to learn
- fast paced
- easy to create a handicap, especially for newbies vs experienced players
- very thematic (Star Wars)
- it feels like piloting those ships

Cons:
- the core set is a bit thin on components
- the rules about ships overlapping each other or overlapping obstacles could have been more elegant
- chance and dice rolling play a big role.
- components could have some sort of sticky base to avoid having to buy a play mat. As it stands, it is difficult to be accurate, moving ships inadvertently, especially in congested dogfights

 Probably I should rate this game a 9, because it is great. 
But FFG decided to sell things in a customer unfriendly way to maximize profit. F.i.  You want to have a specific upgrade Card but not this ship it is sold with, bad luck!
 Also pilots are attached to a single ship, don't you think that Skywalker would be able to pilot different ships?
 Also missions are only available with bigger boxes, not separately.

Well, after selling my X-Wing collection due to a few unbearable niggles i had with the system (and after the fanboys called me a few names, and said those problems were me talking Bullshit). FFG have tweaked some of the rules / space plane stats. And, surprise surprise, have generally tried to alleviate these 'non existent' problems. 

Under the guise of the new movie tie in, the revised core set is looking tip top for some proper dogfighting. So basically, i'm back in. Its a perfect jump back in point. But it will be in a less excitable, don't blindly just buy everything from this point forward, kind of way.

RATING: 9.9
FFG does living games really well, and X-Wing absolutely is one of them (even though it doesn't carry the "living" name). Balance remains great, builds are varied, new content keeps coming out, tournament support is good.

Time for the game is a problem though, as for all games, for me.

Alright, so after finding time and friends to commit to a game with plenty of expansion packs, I can definitely say that I like this game. While I do own the base game, I am basing my rating on playing several matches with other expansions that my friends own.

It's exciting for small skirmish matches and the rules are not that hard, especially for people (like me) that are not well in depth with tabletop miniatures. The components are top notch, durable and should I even bother mentioning how spectacularly detailed each ship is?

The setup takes a long time for multiple ships, especially if you're disorganized. It's about the same length of an actual match. Plus some of the rules are not quite so squared away. There were scratchy-head moments to be found. The tokens get rather annoying having to place and drag them next to other ships that, by doing so, will inevitably cause your arm to mess up other ships' positions.

All-in-all, I will always accept a SW dogfight challenge, but I'm not going to invest in this...especially since the game (like a lot of FFG systems) essentially requires you to pick up plenty of expansions to get the overall experience.

One of my favorite Star Wars games. Love the look of the minis on the table. Easy to teach, but great depth over time as you get a grip on pilot and tech combos. Fleet builds are fun to tweak as well. Once again, costs can be prohibitive to some players. Go to your FLGS and have someone demo the game for you, and if it's your bag a core set is pretty good value.

This is my latest past-time.  So far I've lost a lot to an opponent with highly manueverable imperial ships (ties and interceptors).  I have to figure out the scum strategies better.

So far it's fun and interesting.  Dogfighting is new to me.  Too soon to give this a rating though.  This is also my first foray into miniatures.  Best I can tell, it's not as expensive as many miniatures games, and I love the intense level of detail on these.  

I literally stare at these things and there aren't any flaws.  The only thing a little lacking is the big ships (I have a YT-666 / Hound's Tooth), where, there aren't any mistakes, but the details are just really big :-(

Wing of Star Wars is as good as the parent games in every way and has the added coolness of old school Star Wars. 

I like the pilot Actions better, and the templates/dial are way easier than the card decks from WoW.

It is pricey, but so are all mini's based games. 

Really best as a 2 player, but larger numbers work ok. 

If I had to sum it up I think x-wing takes a great flight sim engine from wing of war and adds a game on top of that.  Streamlining the movement to be perhaps less realistic (these are space ships) but simpler, and adding in the decisions of the pilot actions to add a lot of fun to the game. 

The deck building aspect of this also adds to the game.

Had Small collection. 17 ships.

Game is solid but really needs good, focused game group to get most of it. Game is really poor for casual gaming.
 Skilled player will butcher bad player in a second. Ultimately had to get rid of it because it just didnt hit the table. Took alot of space from the gaming closet :) Quite bad powercreep and lack of important cards in packs sucks (1-2 cards each pack).

Fun, easy to learn game with nice minis. I like the fact that you just play on a tabletop with no board and move freely within the space - though it seems easy to get tangled up in other ships/asteroids. My daughter, who is not that big into Star Wars, is enjoying it, which is a plus. Of course, it's a collectible game, so expect to invest some money into it if you want it to have any longevity.

This expansion forces players that already have a lot of base stuff like rulers etc to buy that stuff again. Would have been more fair to split this into two boxes, one with the ships and cards and one with the rest of the stuff, or at least offer the three ships & cards as an alternative for those who already have enough dice, rulers and tokens. But that's not the FF way, is it.

Same game as original core set, however with TFA pilots and ships.

This was a great miniature game of Star Wars, something I always looked forward to.  It comes with a lot of pieces in excellent condition.  The game was okay to learn and a lot of fun playing it.  I liked the new damage deck and the new ships were good.

Our first game took awhile, probably mostly due to rules, setup, and drafting.  Might have to predraft in the future to cutdown on time.  I'm rating this slightly lesser than the original core set as I prefer the original trilogy.

(5+ plays)  We've had a couple of games where the game mechanics and theme played out so well with the drama - this whole system works far better than I expected.  Even with the base tutorial scenario, you can have a Tie Fighter a dogging the X-Wing - so he just can't shake him or the stress token - until that desperate moment where just the right guess sets up a focused shot.  Explosion.  Game over.  Let's try a DIFFERENT mission!  ... sure, which one?

Yeah, this is a great one.

Rating based on the game system, the meta, and support from FFG. I was hooked with the 100 point design challenge. There are almost always people available to play. The Force Awakens set is a great starting point. The new ships are excellent, though there are considerably fewer upgrade cards than the original base game.

Due to space constriants - no pun intended - I have only played a single game of this, but found it really good fun! We are hopefully moving to a bigger place soon, and when we do I fully intend to play this more, and maybe invest in some of the expansion sets - the miniatures are really cool, and some of the sets look like they change the game in amazing ways - Star Wars is one of my favourite things and having the collectable aspect of the miniatures as well as the fun aspect of the game itself, I can see myself spending a LOT of money on this!

I played with a couple extra ships, but honestly this seriously feels like dogfighting. Almost like a MOBA on a table with the tactical decision-making that is involved. Nothing feels better than an outplay in this game. Only criticism is the dice-based combat. Can have a pretty large impact but it's a standard dice combat system so whatevs.

We can't get enough of this game! I wish I would have purchased it sooner. My 6yo loves the tension of the dogfights and I offset the squad points to make it a little easier for her. 

Fantastic game and I can see us playing for years to come because it is so easily scaled. Be careful with the TIE fighters though. I snapped one right off its peg with the slightest touch.

Beyond the obvious need to cross-promote the new film, I can't really see the need for this expansion. 'New' X-Wings? Check. 'New' TIE Fighters? Check.

That said, despite the deeply uncreative new ships (not FFG's fault), this is a really solid core set as it has the all new improved damage deck and is nicely tweaked. The T-70 might still not deeply competitive but Omega Leader is a great addition all on her own.

One of the best, if not the best, tabletop systems I had the oppportunity to play.

Just like the old core set, with slightly different ships and upgrades though. The "new" X-Wing is going to fire the "old" rebel fighter except for a few selected X-Wing pilots like Luke or Biggs which will still do their job. But actually, the old X-Wing hasn't seen much play anyway lately.

Amazing game easy to learn and fun to play. I bought this for a number of reasons, first it's star wars. Two it's star wars miniatures, and three it's a fantasy flight game that my daughter and I can play. I watched videos read the manual and bought the game. I also built a game board out of an aluminium sign and black felt. I explained the rules to my daughter and we played she had a good grasp of what needed to be done, and did a real good job and playing. We have played three times just dog fighting and really enjoy the game.

Three plays with the base game. We had some troubles with the rules, but figured them out in the end.

The game is very similar to the "old" core set.

Secret orders give a nice touch to the play, and once you learn the basics, the game is quite fast. Shooting is very luck based, so fighting can go on for a long time or end up very quickly. Needs some play area (90cm x 90cm), which might be difficult at times. Easy to learn and teach.

Eddig teljesen hidegen hagytak ezek a méricskélős wargame-ek, de örülök, h ezzel a játékkal tettem egy próbát. Ha mást is ez riaszt csak el, de a Star Warst viszont szereti, érdemes lehet egy próbát tenni, hiszen elég egyedülálló élményben lesz része a profi minőségnek köszönhetően. Sajnos ennek megfelelően az ára is húzós, az FFG nem viccel, mélyen a zsebbe kell nyúlni, ha egy valamirevaló oldalt létre akarunk hozni. Ennek ellenére most úgy gondolom, h megéri a dolog, nagyon élvezetes a buildek próbálgatása és a különböző hajók (pilótaképességek) és upgrade-ek egymásra hatása.

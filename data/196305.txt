Don't get why people like this one so much.  Very chaotic.  Even in 2 player mode you can mess with each other so much as to make planning useless.  No theme either.  Didn't like it.

Add 'em to Fellowship and add more life and versatility to your Guildhall Fantasy. Or, just play with either set when teaching.

Jest potencjał na kombosy. Gra zdecydowanie zyska w gronie osób, które dobrze znają karty i ich efekty. Bez tego jest nieco chaosu. Prawdopodobnie im dłużej się gra w tę grę, tym lepsza będzie o niej opinia.

I was pleasantly surprised by Guildhall and the strategies involved.  I also loved the "screw you" aspect of the game, given that my playgroup has a tendency to be nice to each other in games at times.  Overall, I really liked it, my playgroup liked it, and we've taken this and the other 2 Fantasy versions of Guildhall out to play multiple times.  Lots of fun!

Really enjoy this, simple but highly strategic set collection, that plays quite differently from anything else I've played. We found this set to be more 'thinky' than Coalition, the other set we've played, with abilities that are more roundabout and a bit harder to use well, though this should improve with more plays and a better grasp of the strategy. Overall, very much enjoyed it, and the other sets, so I'd recommend it for sure! Also, it's nice to see they took into account colorblindnes, by putting symbols for color on each of the cards- not something I myself need, or anyone in our group, but I often see it mentioned, and this game is very color heavy. Glad everyone will be able to enjoy it!

Jak na razie chyba mój faworyt z serii Najemników. Wydaje się, że najłagodniejszy jeśli chodzi o negatywną interakcję. Potrafi sporo namieszać dzięki opcji dociągania i przeszukiwania kart z talii odrzuconych.

One of my new favorite games. Very simple rules with good combos and strategies.

RATING: 7
Dodge and weave, trying to work up a powerful combo without exposing yourself to attacks. It's a fun dynamic, and you can make personal progress [i]somewhat[/i] more safely here than in a lot of "no, you first" games like Pagoda.

BUT the meaningless color tracking (red Wizards have nothing to do with red Spellblades) and the occasional Sisyphean feeling of knowing your opponent can steal ANY card you play are both limiting my enthusiasm.

On the third hand, it's like Innovation except you don't need to play 20 times to learn which powers are out there. As a born-again Innovation fan I now appreciate its richness. But having for years hated how arbitrary Innovation seemed when I didn't know the deck, I see a lot of value in this simplification. Just not sure if I need it.

2017-10-29 - I think I said all I have to say about this new version in my comment on Guildhall Fanatasy: Fellowship. This just has more roles, and more roles is good!

Solid game, but I feel like the abilities on the cards for this version are a little too complex for my group. Prefer the more straightforward abilities in Fellowship.

SPIEL 2016

This box only contains 2 roles from the original Guildhall and 2 from Job Faire but with different naming. The assassin in this set is different from the assassin in the original set making it distracting. I think this set is more complicated, especially with the more difficult assassin and psyon roles. The card layout also distracts you away from the abilities the cards have, the original guildhall has more opaque ability boxes and the symbols are less detailed which makes for easier gameplay for first time players. Probably getting better after more plays but I think this version will be intimidating for first time players. All in all, I like it but I'm not 100% confident on the new game art so 0.5 points lower in my rating.

I have been playing both the Guildhall Games enough that I can't remember which is which (and I do mix them sometimes).  Great games!  The player interaction is high and it is fun to get combos working where you can have a play that leaves others going wah?  It is a slow start for new players, but by the end of the first game, everyone seems to understand and play with confidence by the second game.  AP very possible, but a great game nonetheless.

My favorite set collection game. The card design is just terrible though. From card background colors, to squished artwork, to terrible font sizes, to unaligned symbols, to useless iconography ... it's a mess. Mechanically - beautiful, tense gameplay, controllable take-that, tons of replayability by selecting different guilds -- love it. But it's so 3-wolves tshirt cringe worthy to look at ... *sigh*

Clever game, I enjoyed the gameplay.  For some reason it felt like more work than it should be, maybe just too tricky to teach and explain to get the hang of.

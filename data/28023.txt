Wow. I'm surprised it took me this long to get this game. I wasn't keen on racing games before, but this is much more than a racing game. Sure, you're trying to get to the finish line, but that focus has never won me a game yet. Instead, it matters to be the best pirate. you may not come in across the line first, but who cares when you've got all that booty to spend! Seriously, this game has it all. Easy to learn rules, family friendly, a 2 player variant that ADDS TO the game instead of subtracting from it, great components, an AMAZING insert for storage, and a PIRATE THEME! Wow. Again, Wow.

Fiz questão de comprar esse jogo depois de tantos elogios feitos pelos reviews do Dice Tower. Além do visual (que é realmente bom, mas não chega a ter uma qualidade de edições Deluxe), o maior mérito é que todos os jogadores jogam no turno de cada um. Com ações simultâneas e batalhas o jogo não fica chato mesmo com número grande de participantes. O fato do objetivo ser uma mistura de chegar antes e ter mais ouro também ajuda a deixar tudo mais interessante. Se existe um defeito é a simplicidade - será que não poderíamos ter mais tesouros mudando o jogo e dando mais poderes para cada navio?

I've finally found a great pirate game! This is what I wanted Pirate's Cove to be... lots of battle (but nothing that ruins you), treasure collecting, and lots of laughs. The winner isn't always the person who finishes first in this game, which I like. I think it needs to be played with at least four, preferably the full six. I'm glad I spent a little extra to pick this up.

A largely random experience, where players make the most of very limited options following a series of dice rolls. Beautiful artwork and components lift the game a lot, and there is some room for decision making here. It runs on a little long for such a simple design, but does have some fun elements. Probably a great game to play with family, but not much strategy involved for other players.

Surprisingly great game that plays in about 30-40 minutes even with 4 or 5 people, it's Pirate's Cove light. It is very nicely produced - great components. The wooden dice are over sized and easy to handle. Great for kids too since the mechanics are gentle and speedy. The luck is evened out by your card draw decisions. Lovely design. I'm very glad I have it!

RATING: 5
Jamaica is a take on the matter how to make roll-and-move mechanics appeal to more serious gamers. This is achieved by giving the players a degree of control over the movement and adding a layer of resource management to the mix. You can also try to pull of different strategies depending on how much you are into exploring and raiding instead of rushing it to the finish line. The game sure has quite a high luck factor to it but the play time is just right for it not to become an issue. 

Personally I did not fancy Jamaica too much but I would not mind playing it occasionally. Too often I felt that I was not given enough options or the best choice was too obvious. But this is just me wanting to have a meaning to everything.

This is a light-medium race game with a bit of piracy thrown in.  As such, it's  a lot of fun.  The artwork is also really attractive.  You get a lot for your money.  It's not as involved, strategic or tactical as Pirate's Cove, but there is a little bit of that in this with a large dollop of luck thrown in.  It would make a good family game if you dare risk those lovely cards with kids.  Those who are po-faced serious-only gamers will not like it at all.

I can't wait to play this with my nieces! The artwork is beautiful and the pieces are well made.  The insert is also perfectly made to fit all the pieces.  Definitely worth the money, and I'm so glad I added this to my game library. Solid 8 rating for me.  It could be higher if the two-player variant was a bit more filled out.

RATING: 6
A fun pirate racing game.  The cargo hold rule (can't swap out same type of cargo) provides an interesting consideration.  The captain choosing the order of the dice (day/night) provides a nice element of control (when you're the captain).  The card mechanism provides choices while still constraining options.  The treasure cards are a nice addition and incentive, though I think some of them may be a bit overpowered (particularly the saber – I won all my battles, though I lost the game by a hefty margin).  Also, the art is incredible!  Production value is rather nice.

Of course, the big negative is that it's all random.  The battles, the dice, the card draw.  Don't take this one seriously or try to plan too much, it ebbs and flows a lot.  Plus, there's a huge bonus (5 pts) for crossing the finish line.  I think that bonus, and the others on the final 8-10 spaces, may be a bit much.  Seemed to somewhat lessen the need for lots of gold cargo.

A fun game but very random and with a few aspects that may be considered slightly imbalanced.  (Only slightly, not a huge problem.)  The art and production value do give this a nice bump, though.  The reason I rate it a 6 instead of a 7 is because, while it was fun, it wasn't as much fun as other random and/or racing games I've played.  The random elements often feel chaotic and the player often has to choose from the lesser of his undesirable choices.  Yes, part of the game, but annoying at times, nonetheless.

Play this one, it's definitely worth a try, but know that it's pretty random.

Jamaica is a very good game. It can be played by a wide number of players, it's easy to teach, it's quite funny and quick enough to make the people at your table willing to play it a few times in a row. There's a good amount of interaction, that makes everything more spicy.

For these reasons and for the amazing quality of the components and artworks I think that Jamaica is a great gateway game. When I moved to Klagenfurt for my Erasmus scholarship, I faced the situation of introducing people to boargaming and this one worked better than many other games I tried to use (like Ticket to Ride for example).

So this game is not tactically super interesting, nor is it brain burney. But for sitting around a table, playing a game while possibly having a beer, this game does well. It's also probably easy enough that non-gamers can get in on the action.

I'm not a big pirate fan (Go Ninjas!), but if you like that theme, this game will be even better.

Pirates having a race round an island while grabbing treasure and firing cannon at each other is my idea of fun.

Fun little "racing?" game.  Didn't seem like much of a race since everyone stays tight the whole way, and coming in first place does not mean you won.  The treasure cards really make the winner.  If you can grab and keep (or steal from opponents) you will win the game because a majority of the points are in these cards.

Fits what most 80s/90s kids think a board game should be in that it's racing around a board.  The twist is that instead of a roll/move mechanic, it's playing cards.  It's fun and light for all crowds.

I really enjoy this game for so many reasons. It is light and easy to teach and pick up quickly; the board, cards and chits etc., all have fantastic artwork; it's possible for somebody way out in front to start with fall back and likewise somebody way at the back initially can catch up and even win the game; I really like that it plays up to 6 comfortably as well. 

This is highly recommended and I am really happy I have a copy of this game in my collection!

RATING: 7
Great theme and fun if you enjoy chaos. 

Complexity - simple, you roll dice and move or get items based on the card you play from your hand. 

Strategy - low, you have limited choices based off randomly drawn cards. 

Luck - high, between dice rolling, random card drawing and treasures that can make or break your chance at winning it can be hard to win consistently. 

Interaction - moderately low, you may want to do a battle to plunder another ships goods or treasure but if things are going your way you will want to stay away from others and if you are far in the lead with a good draw there is nothing others can do to stop you. 

Fun - the theme and battles can add great fun with the outcome making or breaking your chances to win. Anybody can win, even first time players.

We don't play racing games too often. But the Dice Tower guys talk about this game soooooooo much that we just had to give it a try. And we were not disappointed. Jamaica is a solid game with some of the simplest mechanics put into a game together with some of the best components. You race around the island of Jamaica collecting gold, food and powder in order to outrace and out fight your opponents. Dead simple but so much fun it's almost criminal. Even the two player variant with the Ghost Ship is easy to play unlike most two player variants that involve dummy players. If only that hadn't made the rule book like a treasure map! It makes it such a pain to look up any rules. Fortunately they're aren't a lot of them. Check it out! It won't disappoint!

[ESP] Un gran juego de carreras, tal vez el que más me ha gustado hasta el momento. PAra todo tipo de jugadores.

En 1675, luego de una larga carrera en piratería, Henry Morgan es designado gobernador de Jamaica, con la explícita orden de limpiar el Caribe de los piratas y bucaneros. En lugar de eso, él invita a sus antiguos colegas y camaradas en armas a unirse a él en su retiro, y así disfrutar de los frutos de sus saqueos en la impunidad.
Cada año, en recuerdo de los "buenos viejos tiempos", Morgan organiza el gran desafío, una carrera alrededor de la isla, en cuyo final el capitán con la mayoría de oro es declarado Gran Ganador.

Super Ausstattung die zum Spielen einlädt und das erfolgreich auch die Spielemuffel.
Evt. sind Wenigspieler am Anfang etwas unsicher wegen den beiden Phasen (morgens und abends) und befürchten das das Spiel recht komplexer ist. Aber spätestens nach dem 2ten Durchgang sollte eigentlich jeder verstanden haben worauf es ankommt und das man sich dann ganz dem Rennen um die Insel widmen kann. Und das macht schon sehr viel Spass. Der Mix aus Wüfel und Kartenglück sowie das Taktieren mit den beiden Tagesphasen sowie das Haushalten der Resourcen ist auch für Gelegenheitsspieler schnell überschaubar und spannend. Die direkt Nachfrage das Spiel direkt nochmal zu spielen ist auch ein Grund für die gute Beurteilung.

First off, I think the look and production is very nice.  Gameplay-wise, I would file it as one of those tweener games that is too light for gamers and too uninteresting, long, and/or complex for non-gamers.  I think the best demographic for it would be a game for gamers to indoctrinate their children.  Not particularly bad, though.

Wonderful, light racing game with pirates and minimal combat rules. I love how the cards and dice are used in accordance, and the penalty system for when you can't pay your space after a movement. Treasures with abilities help keep the game varied and swinging, while the artwork cant be beat. Excellent design with a nice tactile feel due to the cargo holds, etc.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Tentative rating after one play.  Beautiful game, but it falls into the family game genre, not necessarily for gamers.  For gamers it is going to be too luck driven.  Combat and movement are all dictated by die rolls.  The cannons should actually be gunpowder tokens.  If you think of them that way it makes much more sense.

On the other hand plus points as this is a pirate game.

Not much beyond a filler I think but it's more than capable of fulfilling that role. The artwork is great, especially how the player cards form a long picture if placed correctly on the table. Enough choices to actually be making choices but not enough that anyone should suffer from AP.

This game is a ton of fun. Card management, resource management, great art, great flavor, and all in a family game style. It's a little too advanced for lil'uns but actually a lot of fun for adults. I think the target age should be a bit higher than 8 but kids are smarter these days, so what do I know!? Big plus, the packaging. You open the box and everything has its own space to go which is rare these days, no tokens flopping around or guessing how to pack your game up. I know that's not a reason to buy or check a game out, but other publishers could take a lot from that!

RATING: 7.5
Nothing really outstanding on this one. The theme feels right, but choices are almost always obvious and luck dependent. If it weren't for the theme I doubt this one would get much higher ratings from me than Chutes and Ladders...

UPDATE: I was wrong. The game might be quite simple, and very luck driven, but it's fast and tense. A game that is, in the end, lots of fun.

A simple roll and move, race game with a fun pirate theme.  Much has been said about the games stellar components and I have to agree.  Top notch art design and hands down the best insert I've ever seen.

Good for a diversion for more serious games now and then.

This game pretends that is giving you options. When in fact you are at a luck of dice when you end up fighting. It has too big a luck factor for me to actually enjoy it with my regular gaming groups.

Initial Impression: The components in this game are gorgeous. Bright colors mixed with cartoony images cover the thick cardboard components. Cute plastic ships that beg to be painted sit in a wonderfully produced insert. The game itself is inviting and accessible for most ages. Surprisingly, the level of depth in the game adjusts to the level of gamer. With children the game can be a simple race. However experienced gamers can introduce a bluffing metagame and take advantage of multiple paths to victory. Do you try to cross the finish line? Do you simply hoard gold? Do you move to attack opponents, hoping that you win the engagement? The choices may seem few, but are interesting.

Gorgeous artwork and possibly the best box-layout ever seen. Every part has a dedicated place in the box and will stay there even if you toss the box around (but who would do THAT?).

The game is so-so with lower player counts and really starts to get going with 5.
The current turn's captain – the player who rolls and determines the dice order – should pay attention to not overthink the dice order (and double check with his available action cards). This would result in dead time for the other players who are just waiting to see the dice order, so that they can figure out what they want to do this turn.

Sure, it's light and very luck-dependent- so what? It's fun, quick, and has you talking like a pirate minutes after you start playing.

One of the most enjoyable games in my collection.

Had a great time learning and playing with the family in Texas. The battles were awesome! Loading up with gun powder... but then bang 1 in 6 will kill/nullify all efforts to attack/defend. Hated losing and couldn't stop thinking about how I could have raced around faster with more balance. The luck of the treasure and haunted booty fit well with the theme and create a lot of chaos. Even within the chaos I think I can do better. Sat around after playing and talked about games with the family for hours... great experience.

RATING: 6
A fun little game, that would be great for families.  It is a simple design and plays in a nice short timeframe.  Balancing out when to advance your ship in the race and when to stock up makes for some great decisions.  There is a lot of luck, especially in the combat, but it's a fairly light game so I don't mind the luck.

What sets this game apart is the art and components.  This game is absolutely gorgeous, and that just adds to the theme.  I'm not usually a huge fan of race games or pirate-themed games, but this one just seems to work so well.  Some players will argue that there is way too much randomness, and therefore it's not for gamers.  However this is easily remedied by increasing the players' handsize.  When a player has more cards to choose from there will be less luck and more strategy.

A decent racing game for the family.  It works well when we are all engaged and turns are taken quickly.  It works poorly when one or more people just aren't into it.  Then it can really D-R-A-G, which of course is the opposite of what you're going for in a racing game.

This beautifully illustrated game is a fairly simple one about pirates racing around the island of jamaica and trying to collect treasure and points along the way. The main hook in this game is that your ship has a certain number of spots for either gold, food or gun powder, and when you get more of anything, it MUST go in an empty spot, or replace things in a spot. You cannot combine loot that you get even if it's the same type, which leads to interesting choices.

Very fun and simple enough to be gateway, give it a try if the theme is even vaguely appealing.

Can definitely be fun, but more with casual gamers.  There's definitely more strategy than it would first seem, but the game's a bit shallow for my taste.  Beautifully produced and I love the art.  It's a good game night game when nobody's decisive on what to play.

Jamaica rewards the careful player that plans his turns ahead, despite the slight randomness added by rolling as many as two dice. Nentheless, it doesn’t either shine nor let you down: it simply works as the light family game it is meant to be. [i](February 2017)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - After several replays, Jamaica is still one of my group’s favorites: light, fun, short and challenging enough. Hence, rating raised from 6 to 7 in November 2017.

Only played this with low numbers. It could be insane in a good way with higher numbers (or the crowdedness could make it a random mess and slow down and extend the game past the point of fun). Time will tell.  OKAY: Rerated it after playing it with higher numbers (multiple games or 4 & 5, 1 of 6). This has become one of my go-to end-of-night, light games that I can break out with game-players of a multitude of experience levels.

RATING: 4
Luck heavy.  Chaotic.  Takes too long.  Having only 3 cards to choose from doesn't allow you to mitigate the luck of the dice (and the day/night sequence).  The treasure card values are pretty far apart... and the combat die has a huge range (2,4,6,8,10,star) which often makes the gunpowder tokens pointless.  Also, I dislike the automatic win in combat when a "star" is rolled.  Lastly, the cost of moving (food/dubloons) seems to be too expensive... making the game unnecessarily slow.

RATING: 7
Lightweight nautical race game with large doses of luck, based on both the cards in your hand and the dice rolls before each round. Saying that, I played this with a bunch of serious, grown up, gamers and I haven't laughed so much at any boardgame. 

The game rules are simple, it's a fun concept and there's enough planning and combat in there to keep things interesting. We laughed most when people got their move cards mixed up and ended up sailing backwards. We wondered if it would be possible to sail round the whole board backwards, but decided you couldn't do it! Looting each others holds was also fun, as was me repeatedly correctly calling my own misfortune in combat.

Jamaica should become a "fun for all the family" classic, given time.

Easy family game You can learn in 15 minutes. It doesn't mean that decisions in the game are easy to make. I think some players can have problems with making decisions sometimes. Super funny design, strong theme, it is a race type where players control pirate ships. Besides the race they have to focus on gathering gold and tresure boxes. Dice rolling mechanics create luck factor that is strong.

Very light racing game.  You have very small hand of cards (3) so choosing a card for a particular die roll is usually not that tough.  Some luck for sure.  Combat is simple and fun.  I do wish there was a little more variety to the gameplay and it feels very stripped down and bare bones to me.  I wish there were special powers, random events, attack cards or some extra stuff like that to spice it up some more.  I guess I wish it was a little more ameritrashy.  Still, this is good game, and it's a great gateway and family game.  So although I don't love it, I do like it, and with certain crowds I think it really shines

Beautiful game -- and I'm not usually dazzled by bits!  After two plays, it seems like a lightish race game that captures the pirate feel much better than games like Pirate's Cove and Winds of Plunder.  Trying to balance resources can be quite a challenge, and (as with most light race games) luck plays a huge role, but it played quickly enough that I didn't mind too much.

RATING: 7
Almost a pure light game, but rated light medium due to the difficulty encountered at times when selecting a card for your 2 actions. Sometimes a player must discern between the lesser of two evils, i.e., do I move into combat or sit and take resources while falling further behind? Combat is a little random, and can make a difference in progress around the board unless card play is carefully selected. Fortunately, losers usually don't get hurt too much. Otherwise, we enjoy this race/collection resource game with a few decisions, but offering a decent amount of fun. With 4 it is more of a race game; 5 and 6 players encounter more conflict and adds a level of difficulty avoiding other players. A hit at every level of gamer experience, save perhaps the diehard strategist. The sheer fun of sailing around the island with others competing for the few treasures in a race for home base is earns this game a high rating despite occasional frustrating dice results for actions.
Includes the 4 cards in the Extra Treasures expansion.

It has strategy and you have to know when to go for it and not leave it too late. Bit like on a racehorse having to track the leader so doesn't get too far ahead but obviously dice place a part( also bit like on a racehorse with a mind of its own ).Fun game and my kids love it.

The game play is very boring, but with the right group (i.e. aggressive), it can be a hoot! The luck factor is so prevalent that the canons mean next to nothing. Play ONLY in larger groups (5 or 6 players) so that there is a lot of grouping and conflict- it's so fun that way. However, with fewer players, or those looking to exercise their brains in any shape, way, or form, stay far far away from this game.

After playing this a second time, I'm starting to feel that Pirate's Cove has a more thematic feel to the game and is a bit more accessible to new gamers. Differentiating between morning and evening and deciding which cards to play in Jamaica takes a while for beginners to grasp correctly. As such, for me to enjoy this game I would prefer to play against experienced cut-throat players. Maybe then I'll raise my rating back up to 7.

I too had high expectations after watching some video reviews here on the geek. However, I don’t think the game is that good, even considering it’s a light family game. It’s actually not so light as I had thought, at least during your first play. I’ve tried it with 3 and 6, and both numbers worked well, although I imagine the sweet spot would be 4 or 5. With 3, there isn’t as much tension and the battles are far between. With 6, the downtime is noticeable and bogs down an otherwise light game.

There is definitely room for clever gameplay, but at the end of the day, you’re rolling a lot of dice (although the two dice are used by everybody in the same round, which I like) and drawing cards randomly, so it’s hard to plan too much ahead, especially as you only have 3 cards available each round. Still, I’ve experienced some extremely clever play when players move forward and cannot pay the cost, and thereby moving back towards a pirate cove and gaining a treasure! These treasures can be worth a significant amount of points (I actually won one of my games when I had the two 7 point treasure tile although I also had the -3 point’er – but that did kind of rubbed me the wrong way as the runner-up was the one who ended in Port Royal with me far behind, and he even had a -4 point curse)… I think that the treasure deck is a brilliant idea, and all of the treasures are useful in their own ways, although some are definitely better than others.

I like that you need to pay food or coins in order to advancing around the island and be the first one to cross the line. Although you don’t necessarily win by crossing the line first, you do have an advantage, but if you’ve stacked up on a lot of gold you might win as well. Just be aware that the other players can attack you if they land in the same spot as you, and this can be quite a luckfest due to the die-roll. The production value is obviously astonishing and helps drawing your family in. It’s a nice light game that probably overstays its welcome with 6, but maybe that was in part due to the fact that we didn’t roll a single 6, so we moved forwards slowly. Definitely not a bad game.

[b]Includes Jamaica: The Extra Treasures[/b]

Jamaica is, for me, a hidden gem of a family game. It's a racing game, and pretty much anyone can get behind the concept of a racing game. It has some dice and hand management of cards, which players use to move forward or backward, or gather up food, or gold, or guns. It has dice chucking combat, and spots where you pick up treasure. It's simply a nice combination of relatively simple rules and fun gameplay. Oh... and it plays up to six.

The game is also gorgeously produced, with artwork on the cards that show pictorial story if you lay them from left to right. Sure it's random, and sure it's light, but given it's weight and length, I'm hard-pressed to think of a better family game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A fun racing game that is good gateway and family game material. Great production across the board for sure and was likely top of its class 9 years ago when it came out. However, it feels just a little fiddly with the moving of goods back and forth from your holds. Yet the battles you have are quick and almost entirely based on the luck of a die roll. It seems like these two ideas contradict each other.

The thing holding this game back for me is that I have played Colt Express and enjoy that game much more. It just removes that small piece of moving all the goods around and in my mind focuses so much more interaction than Jamaica and makes it a more suitable family game with more laughs and more enjoyment.

Gameplay is simple, mechanics are naturaly fitting the theme and there is just enough strategy for the game not to be complete randomness but also accesible for younger audience.

In my opinion a perfect family game and a must if you plan to play with kids and/or non-gamers.

RATING: 5
This was pretty painful to play. The components are nice, but it really felt like the game was playing me. The decisions you have to make are not as important as I'd like them to be. Because your holds are so limited, most of what you take early will be turned over a couple times before you get to the end. 

I wish there were more ways to be able to 'bank' some of your gold prior to the end.  There is no way to really defend it from other pirates, since you're constantly bumping into people hand fighting battles (which you initiate even if you're woefully outgunned). 

The one caveat I have here is that this is a great game for a family with young children. They can easily grasp the theme and the rules, and there is enough chaos/luck (boy is there!) that the young ones can compete pretty evenly with mom and dad. It wouldn't be my first choice for a game for that purpose, but you could do a lot worse.

Rented this from our FLGS.  With three it was random, but kind of fun.  I won't buy it, but I should get in another game or two with the kids before I take it back and apply my $6 credit to buying something else.

Update: Played with four (me and three of my kids ages 7,8 and 11).  We had a loud, rollicking good time, and the winner still felt pretty random.  A light, experience, narrative sort of family game.  Fairly satisfying to go into combat and plunk down 12 powder markers.  The kids learned you can't stock up on just powder and gold or you won't make any progress.  I would love, love, LOVE a more strategic version of this game.

Fun, easy to learn, pirate-themed racing game with great 'Arrrt'work! The board and ship pieces are beautifully designed, as are the player cards (that line up to form a pirate mural). Thematically perfect, gamescore is penalised due to the gameplay being a little too random and the fact I never make my dice rolls in battle.

Roll and move racing game.  It's made more interesting by some user control over movement and direction (forward or back).  The start player rolls two dice then decides how to place them: one must be a day action and one must be a night action.  All players have an identical deck of action cards.  Each card has two actions, a day side and a night side.  The actions are taken according to the number of the die placed in that position.  All players decide, from the drawn cards in hand, which to play.  I'd play again but am not likely to purchase this.

Update: many years later, this has proven itself time and again as the king of games for non-serious gamers. The fact that it scales to 6 with very little downtime bumps it from 8 to 9.

I hate to say it, but I actually agree with Tom Vasel. Awesome game. DSP? No? SdJ? Sure. Just pure family fun. By far the most beautiful components to a game I've seen in a long long time. And by components I mean the cards. The board is fine, but the cards are over the top. I'm happy just looking at them without even playing. This is a pirate racing game. Sounds silly, right? It is. And that's why it works. Of course what kind of pirate racing game would be complete without needing food for your crew, finding treasure, getting cannons to blast other people's ships, and stealing their booty? Check. Check. Check. I actually find the game to be fairly clever, even beyond the great art and silliness. There's an interesting mechanic where each player gets a hand of three cards, where each cards has two actions, morning and night. But the magnitude of the actions (e.g. how far to move forward or backward, how much gold, food or cannons to collect) is determined by dice. One person rolls, then chooses which to assign to morning and which to evening. After seeing, everyone chooses one of their cards simultaneously, and then turns are resolved.

Arrived 8-27-2008, This is a fun family racing game with Great artwork and a well tied in theme.  

How was this game not nominated for the SdJ in 2008??

My wife and I both felt that this was a superb candidate for the award.  It is a fun family game with easy rules, and under 1hr play time.  

Will I play it again?  OH Yes!!
Is it a game i will introduce to new gamers?? YES!
Is it a Gateway Game??  OH YES!

If you have a family who you game with then this game is a must have in your game library.

What I like about this race game is the speed of play, the quality of the components, the depth of the artwork and that every choice is really 2 choices in one.

What bothers me a bit is the randomness - there's so much that it can put one unlucky player very far behind.  I think this could potentially be fixed by letting players have more than 3 cards to choose from each round.  Maybe you get your whole deck to start and then run through them until you're out?

That being said - some strong potential here.

Components: Beautiful board, nice tokens and dice, and absolutely gorgeous cards (forming an incredible panoramic view from the perspective of a drinking pirate); the best cards I've seen. The insert is also well designed. I like the treasure map aspect of the rules.

Experience: Fun. There are simple yet interesting decisions to be made on each turn, just trying to balance my load, manage my cards, and hoard treasure. There is enough variety to the course (with the three forks, the skull coves, and the variously-numbered ports and open sea spaces) to keep it fresh. Very tactical.

2-6 players, 30-60 minutes, light racing game

Have played this game twice, once with my gaming group (3) and once with my son (10). Both games were a lot of fun, although I came in last on both occasions. The game looks really nice, the artwork of the box, the components and even the manual is stunning. The game mechanics are quite alright too and ensure a lot of player interaction.

The game probably works better with more players. 

Verdict: keeper

This is a pirate-themed tactical race game with player interaction and side goals (e.g. detouring for treasure). The winner is the player who best balances their position in the race with their success at the side goals.

A pirate racing game.  Collect food, gold, gunpowder, and treasure.  Pay food/gold to land on certain spaces.  Land on the same square as an opponent and do combat.  Spend gunpowder for advantage; winner gets some loot from loser.  

Interesting action mechanisms with the cards.  Actions allowed include moving forward or backward, and collecting resources (gold, food, gunpowder).  Dice roll determines the quantity of goods or number of movement.  

This game serves as a go-to game with non-gamers.  It's got great-looking bits and board, is easy to grasp, and is over before it becomes too boring for me.

Party game with few decisions. Best with 6, good component quality, art is nice, racing game, lots of random dice rolling. Despite card play, feels like a roll and move and entirely luck dependent.

RATING: 6
Got this at the end of 2011.  It's a step above your typical roll & move game because there is some strategy involved in playing choosing which card to play for each turn based on how the dice are assigned.  It's a good game to convert non-gamers to gamers.

I am a big fan of this game.  The gameplay is very easy to learn/teach, and the dice/card driven gameplay is unique and makes it challenging to decide which card to use with different rolls of the dice.  The artwork is awesome, and I really liked the idea that "winning" the race was only part of it, and in order to win the game, you also need to collect treasure cards and gold coins as they contribute to your total points at the end as well.  Love it!

A fun racing game with a pirate them and simple rules. Each player has a pirate ship and five holds in which you can store gold, food or gunpowder. The "captain" roles two dice, places them on day and night spaces, each player picks an action card, then you do what the card says. You need food to travel through most sea spaces, gold for ports, and gunpowder for battles. In addition, there are nine pirate lairs with a variety of treasures that cost nothing to move into. The first to circumnavigate the island gets 15 bonus gold; the most gold wins. Has great aesthetics, up there with Tikal, Zombicide, and Descent. A bit more luck-centered than most games on this list.

Old school race game where players race their pirate ship around the island of Jamaica.  One player rolls a pair of dice, and players select their cards to define their "morning" and "evening" actions for the turn.  Actions are movement, or loading (food, gold or gunpowder).  Game ends when one player completes a lap, and players are awarded points for progress, gold obtained, and treasure.  Fun game, feels a bit like Hase und Igel.  Enjoyed it.

I love the gorgeous board, artwork, and components, and the box insert is expertly designed.  The theme is really fun to play with casual gamers. I'm also a big fan of the simulaneous action planning mechanic. The game is very easy to teach, although the layout of the rulebook is a bit awkward.  My only complaint is the amount of luck involved in winning the game. I don't mind luck in a game, especially one this thematic, but the luck to skill ratio seems a bit high in this one, especially with the large variance of the attack die.  Luckily, this is the kind of game that is still really fun regardless of what place you're in, so I still enjoy it a lot.

RATING: 10
This is one of the most unique games I have ever played. The card play in this game adds a very strategic dimension to a fairly generic racing game. There are two actions on each card. If you choose one, you have to do the other! It really makes you think about what your best possible move is each turn!
Not to mention, that you get to blow your friends out of the water and steal their gold :)!!

Jamaica Esagerato per quanto riguarda i materiali... Simpatico nelle meccaniche, lo avevo gia nel carrello sui vari store online se non fosse che a metà partita mi sono un po' stufato e non vedevo l'ora che finisse... Mi è risultato lungo a causa dell'AP di un giocatore e anche a causa dei vari momenti in cui in mano non hai carte movimento, ma magari solo combinazioni di Oro, Cibo e Cannoni. 
Peccato davvero perchè i materiali meriterebbero l'acquisto anche solo per tenerlo esposto... 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E finalmente.. ho riunito attorno ad un gioco tutta la famiglia (missione veramente impossibile solo a pensarla qualche mese fa)! 
JAMAICA è riuscito nell'impresa!!!!! 
D'altronde era il primo dei Family-games che avevo comprato apposta per questo scopo e pare abbia soddisfatto un po' tutti, soprattutto mio padre che pur sbagliando quasi tutto ad ogni turno si è divertito da matti a cannoneggiare ed ha pure "sfiorato" la vittoria..

This game seems expensive, but wow is it well produced.  Even the insert is perfect.  I could do without the map-fold otu instruction manual format, though.  The game is very fun, and was really liked by all!  The POW on the combat die adds a lot of excitement.  I found there to be a satisfying amount of strategy and risk management.  It also has just the right amount of player conflict to keep things interesting but still light-hearted.

This has been a very pleasing game and one I'm super happy to have added to my collection. The components are very fun, the rules are pretty straight forward and it is just an enjoyable game all around. The rules printed out like a map is a cute idea, but it should have just stayed an idea. Everyone has had a great time with the game when I've played and it fits into that lighter weight category of games that I like, so I see this one staying around for a long while.

RATING: 7.25
A light filler game with a fair bit of randomness that’s best played with people that are not so serious. 
   
However I am not a fan of the artwork: I feel there is strong disconnect between the gameplay and the Disney-inspired art.  The artwork makes the game look like its aimed at children under 12 and puts it in the same realm as Candy Land.  However, while the mechanics of the game are simple, they aren’t as simple (or even appropriate) as Candy Land which is what the game looks like.  

While the cut-throat tactic of battling other players (which is often out of your control) and the discontent of working hard to obtain treasure only to find out its cursed, may correlate well with the Pirate theme, it may likely cause too much grief and doesn’t exactly instill the best of values (or behavior) for the very same young children that the art aims the game towards.  Unless of course you are trying to encourage you children to attack other children and steal their plunder.  Imagine Candy Land where players obtain candy along the way, but when another player comes along and lands on the same spot, they get to steal the other child’s candy.  Older children can handle this, but then older children might be put off with the childish artwork here.  

The child-geared artwork also tends to put off a lot of adults; you are essentially playing a game that looks like Candy Land.  I would very much like to see the artwork in this game redone with a slightly more mature look and see how people take to the game.  It would be a great experiment to see if adults take to game more if it was re-themed with cover art from the show “Black Sails” for example.  And give us some plastic and better looking doubloons!, not the corny looking cardboard ones with cartoon skulls on them – the ones sold in party stores look better than these.  

However, my rating here is based on the actual gameplay, not the artwork.

This pirate game does exactly as advertised: gather a group of casual gamers around a table to enjoy a light game of fun entertainment! Everyone that sees it's beautiful graphics wants to play it, and everyone that plays it, likes it.

Personally, it is too light of a game for me, but as a gamer that wants to recruit new gamers, this game rocks!

[b]12.27.09 Update:[/b] I played this recently with two players and was pleasantly surprised to find it worked great. Rating goes up a tick.

[b]10.25.16 Update:[/b] This hasn't seen the table in forever. I'm guessing it the mix of luck and attacking. However, I still see the need to keep it in my collection for the demographic that likes some mainstream games like Risk and such.

Fun: Because each and everyone from your family will enjoy.

Addictive: It just is. At least for me when I just want to grab all the gold and bomb the other ships and get to Port Royale first over and over again.

Beautiful: Probably one of the most beautifully designed game I ever came across (The box, board, cards) you name it.

In conclusion.  Get. This. Game.

RATING: 6
A difficult rating - on one hand this is a game that really works well and has engaging mechanics, on the other hand I think it is geared towards the more casual gamer, as it basically presents you with a minimal decision tree each turn (usually you choose between only 3 cards, and it is clear which one is the best). If you play with kids and casual gamers, add 2 to this rating, but the game will hold little lasting interest for the more serious gamer. Game material is beautiful, by the way, and the box (plus inserts) are great!

It looks very nice and is simple to learn and to play.  The race can be exciting at times.  The take that element is light and fun and doesn't hurt anyone's feelings.  The forward backward mechanic can get a bit tedious in some situations.  All in all a fun kid's game.

This game is a lot of fun with kids, or adults with the right attitude. There is a lot of luck in this game and the best moves are usually easy to see. But for a light racing/combat game I really like it!

Components, box insert, and the artwork are all top shelf. I don't think I have a better looking game in my collection. 

Biggest complaint: The rules are printed in a fold out map style, very annoying.

This is a pirate-themed tactical race game with player interaction and side goals (e.g. detouring for treasure). The winner is the player who best balances their position in the race with their success at the side goals.

Setting: Jamaica, 1675.
After a long career in piracy, Captain Henry Morgan skillfully gets appointed to be Governor of Jamaica, with the explicit order to cleanse the Caribbean of pirates and buccaneers! Instead, he invites all of his former "colleagues" to join him in his retirement, to enjoy the fruits of their looting with impunity. Each year, in remembrance of the "good old days," Morgan organizes the Great Challenge, a race around the island, and at its end, the Captain with the most gold is declared Grand Winner.

I like the race around the board idea as well as the theme and artwork of the game.  It seems pretty well balanced with not too much luck factor, though there is some.  Its simple enough for anyone to learn and it doesn't take real long.  I think the only thing that could be improved is the battle between ships, it is a little anti-climatic.  small complaint though.  I do wonder if this game won't have a lot of replay value...I could see it getting old if played too much as there isn't tremendous variability in how you play.

RATING: 8
Even though Jamaica is technically a pirate-themed racing game, it feels like a lighter version of Pirate's Cove. But even though it's fairly lightweight, there's a lot of fun to be had here. Movement is done through a fairly ingenious joint dice/card system, and there's a little bit of strategy to be had when figuring out whether to fill up your hold with coins, food or gunpowder or make a beeline for the finish. Combat is a bit too luck-driven for me; even if you have loads of gunpowder and treasure cards to add to your dice roll, you can be wiped out by that nasty "instant kill" face on the combat die. But those minor misgivings are allayed by the sheer fun of this game.

Jamaica deserves special mention for its production quality. This has to be the best presentation of a board game I've ever seen. The artwork is bright and cartoony without being cheesy, the board is gorgeous, and there's not a sub-par component to be found. Jamaica also has the most functional box insert imaginable; every single component has a clearly-defined home, and nothing loses its place even if the box is placed on its side or turned upside down. This game really is a work of art.

This pirate racing game does so many things right.  It's a race, and you can't forget to go fast, but you are also a pirate so finding treasure and attacking others is also important.  The movement system is unusual and adds an element of chaos as well as hand management.  And, of course, the bits are beautiful (although I do wish they hadn't gone with the 'pirate map' rules -- too hard to open up when you need to consult quickly!).

Beautifully produced, lightweight racing game. No, it's not deeply strategic but there's just enough tactics from the cards & dice combos that it works well as either a gateway game, a family game with the kids, or as a great way to finish the evening after a day's gaming. Quick & easy to play...just wish the rules didn't come on a stupidly huge A0 fold-out sheet. Booklets are much easier to handle, people!!

RATING: 8
Rating based on 3 plays. I love the simplicity in the mechanics, excitement and interaction between the players, and the unpredictability on how it will end. Although, most of the times, the winner beats the runner up with a lot of points. But that doesn't matter as long as that's not for certain until the very end.
I suspect that the best strategy is to sail as far as you can when the dice show high numbers (if you have the right cards and combinations). The good thing about this strategy is that you can avoid battles, can go back to treasures if you can't pay, and of course get more points at the end. But I need to try different winning strategies before I conclude.
Lovely components, as well. A really solid game.

As I am a sucker for design I could not resist buying this game,it's gorgeious. The playing cards make a panorama and the general feel is one of quality gaming material. It plays nicely and quickly and although it might have a luck factor (which means I loose the game no matter what because if have the worst of it -- ever wondered how many ones you can throw in a game of frag deadlands -- well let me tell you even my shadow got blown up) I don't think  it a bad side of the game. It makes it more like life itself -> "life is the stuff that happens while you plan otherwise". Hope that the swiss insurance company that is at root of these greatly designed games makes more requests.

Really interesting race game but still very simple. Components are really nice quality and the box insert is very nice. The artwork is exceptional with the card art lining up to give one long image cut into the seven cards.

Cards have two actions morning and evening, two dice are rolled and placed on either morning or evening. The number of pips indicates how many times you may repeat the action, then you pay gold/food/ collect treasure or fight dependent upon the space you stopped in. Then evening occurs in the same way as morning.

There are bonus points for finishing first however these seemed a little high after only one game as the winner had 25 points to second places 7, 15 of which came from the first place.

I've played this twice and both games left me dissatisfied. The first game I just struggled to make my boat move at all. The second game I struggled to make my boat move, and when I finally got going, I had little chance of winning. The game looks great, it's all visual which I like, it's got nice mechanisms. It just does not work as a race. The choice of actions of the cards is 6to5 against forward moves. I'd like to see a bigger card deck with more choices. It's a nice game for what it is, but what it is is not a race.

This is a stupid little pick up & race game, that for who knows what reason I enjoyed.  It is too simple for my gaming groups, and probably too repetitive, and too dicey.  I shouldn't like it, but I do.  I will keep this on hand for children, and adults wanting some simple games.  I want to play it with them.

I admit I was predisposed to liking it because I was attracted to the colors & graphics pictured and as I unpacked it I was very pleased to see great looking components that fit very nicely into a well designed insert (no need to bag here).  The simple rules are laid out in a colorful poster format. Took 10 mins to read, and only a few minutes to set up.  

It is a simple race where pirates pick up loot, have to pay out some gold & food now & then, and battle a little too, and then return to port--the one with the most gold wins.  The box says 45 mins, but can be played faster than that with 3 people.  I like it with more people (5 is best, 6 makes it a little too long for what it is) because there is more combat for what is in a ship's hold (Battle is short & easy). Pirates in the lead tend to collect all the treasures, so if those in the rear must catch them to wrestle the treasures away.  Combat fits well into the theme because this is a raucous group of Henry Morgan's undisciplined pirates who race their ships, and being criminals, they do anything the drunken sots like to win the race.

A simple but interesting racing game. You have to think a bit about what you're doing: where are you using the big dices and the small dices, etc... The biggest problem with the only game I played is that it was decided on the "reshuffle". Since we got to reshuffle once and used only a few cards from the second shuffle, those who drew forward-movement cards scored much higher...

"Jamaïca", c'est un simple jeu de parcours, ni plus, ni moins. Oui, mais un jeu de parcours intelligent, où ce n'est pas forcément le premier arrivé qui gagne. Non, car il y a plein de petits paramètres qui viennent enrichir l'ensemble. Tout d'abord, il y a le choix de l'ordre des dés, qui est un mécanisme très réussi et qui va déterminer l'ordre des actions. Premier choix pour celui qui lance les dés en fonction de ses cartes (qu'est ce qui m'arrange le plus ?), puis choix pour les autres joueurs qui, en fonction de cet ordre, déterminent eux-aussi l'action qui leur semble la meilleure. Mais dans une main limitée à trois cartes seulement, il faut donc choisir de laquelle on se débarrasse et lesquelles on garde pour un jet qui leur conviendrait peut-être mieux.

Au-delà de cette mécanique assez intéressante et qui permet une petite maîtrise du hasard, le jeu regorge de petits détails qui rendent l'ensemble très plaisant à jouer : le parcours qui se sépare, le coût des cases d'arrivée, les trésors à récolter au fur et à mesure, l'organisation des cales de chaque navire... Bref, malgré des règles simplissimes, très vite expliquées, très bien rédigées (il faut noter le travail exécuté sur celles-ci, c'est très intuitif et on trouve très vite la réponse à une question), le jeu a tout juste assez de subtilités pour en faire un jeu certes d'abord familial, mais non dénué d'intérêts et avec une réelle richesse.

Le petit point noir, c'est peut-être le système de combat. Prendre de la poudre permet un certain avantage, mais la stratégie peut être ruinée et nos doublons (qui rapportent quand même beaucoup lors du décompte final) être dérobés sur un simple jet de dé chanceux de l'adversaire qui vous envoie six pieds sous mer, alors même que cet adversaire n'avait aucun avantage au combat. Un joueur qui n'aurait donc plus rien à perdre pourrait combattre sans cesse, jouant uniquement sur sa chance aux dés (ou sur la malchance de ses adversaires), ce qui rend la partie assez désagréable. Un système comme celui de "Deadwood", où le combat se joue aussi aux dés, me semble plus juste, bien que la chance puisse aussi jouer, elle me semble plus maîtrisée que dans "Jamaïca". Les mauvais jets de dés pour les actions, eux, sont moins graves, tout le monde subissant les mêmes tirages.

Mis à part ce bémol, "Jamaïca" est un jeu qui, selon moi, aurait pu/du rencontrer plus de succès auprès du grand public, tant il convient à une audience familiale, tant ses règles sont simples et claires, tant le jeu apporte un vrai plaisir ludique rapide et efficace, sans être brise-neurones. Pour les gros joueurs, le plaisir est sans doute moindre, mais je considère que c'est par ce type de jeux que le public peut s'ouvrir et découvrir de nouvelles choses, parfois plus complexes. Et puis, même si on est gros joueur, quelque chose de plus light de temps à autre, ça ne fait pas de mal. Et matière de jeu light, "Jamaïca" est sans doute ce qui se fait de mieux, ou presque. Alors oui, c'est un simple jeu de parcours et certains diront que le thème est plaqué. On pourrait bien sûr le remplacer par un autre, mais personnellement, je trouve qu'il est en parfaite adéquation avec le sentiment de jeu et les mécanismes mis en place. Même le coup d'une action le matin et une l'après-midi, assez artificiel, arrive à donner un petit plus thématique à l'ensemble.

Ajoutez à cela un matériel irréprochable, et vous obtenez un des jeux que je choisirais sans doute si je devais faire découvrir le jeu de société moderne à des non initiés.

My son thinks this game is a 10. It's a light, fun game that's great to play with non-gamers.  Lots of luck, with interaction dependent on the players. I think it's best with all aggressive players that battle all of the time. It's great to see a ship with tons of gun powder in play sink after a lucky die roll.  Another thing that's nice is that the winner often is not the one that crosses the finish line first.

Extremely great production value!  It's a beautiful game.

As a gateway game, this is one of the best. Not only are the rules fairly simple but the graphics are really great making the game even more enjoyable.

I see it's voted as best with 6 players. While 6 players is great, it does create a lot of chaos in the beginning. It does seem like you can get stuck battling other players in the first 2-3 rounds when playing with 6 players. Still, very cool game with just enough strategy to make it interesting for all.

A gorgeously designed race game with a Pirate theme and some light, fun mechanics not totally devoid of decision making.  There is a lot of randomness in this one, but the player that can best manage the onslaught of these elements will be the victor.  Jamaica is in no means a game of great substance, and is one I would, and have, openly deterred "Gamers" away from.  However, even though this may not be an outing for the more seasoned, and disgruntled among us Jamaica can offer a splendid and fun romp with a strong weight/time ratio.  Plus it allows for a solid gateway type game to host a pirate theme.  Gorgeous, not spectacular, but can be loads of fun.

This game just became a drag.  It took entirely too long to play, as everyone was constantly analyzing what their movements would do and how much it would cost. I understand why, but it made it take entirely too long for what it was.

Jamaica has stellar components and art. Unfortunately the game leaves me wanting; mostly I wish there was more combat. Overall this is a quick and beautiful game to play but don't expect much strategy. Instead expect a race to the finish that might get you caught up in battles with your opponents a couple times.

Awesome game that looks great and has terrific bits. Everything in this game is top notch quality.
This game is sooo much fun. Even for the guy in last place, who many times I have seen come back to win the game. I was tossed between this and Pirate's Cove, but after finally getting to play Pirate's Cove I can say that this is the better game. At least for me. 

Many thanks to my friend Josh who introduced this game to me.

UPDATE - I just recently played this with two players and must say that it was a very enjoyable experience. The rule variation for two players is very well done. It plays just as well with two as it would more players.

Very random and dice based. That should be sufficient to throw or trade it away. But it's beautiful, simple and funny. And that's the reason why you can play it with children.

Besides there's still some tactics involved (not a great one - don't expect any challenges) and in small doses it's more than bearable :-)

I have a lot of fun with this game, but reactions overall can definitely be mixed. You can certainly get stuck in the back of the race, with no real way to catch up, and that's frustrating. It's a fun game to play with the kids, though, and a great game for 5 or 6 players because there is very little downtime.

After 1st Play: it's still a bit beyond my 4.5 year old son, so he and his mom teamed up to control the Red Ship.  This was our first play and we've got a few rules questions to look up, but it's nice, quick, light, beautiful, accessible, and interesting.  Glad I traded for this.

UPDATE after 2nd play: It's light.  It's luck-driven.  It's super pretty. There's no real depth to find in here... the waters around Jamaica are shallow.   It's probably great for young kids, and I need to focus on that purpose and stop looking for a gamer's game in here.  Perhaps there's a better family game out there that allows me to think a little more while my son just has fun.  I'll keep looking, but in the meantime, this is pretty enough to capture and maintain his interest, and short enough that it doesn't take longer than it needs to.

Beautiful game visually. Even the box looks good, like a treasure chest. The game itself is fun, but can be confusing to decide which way to play your cards for some people. There's not too much depth, but there are some tactically fun things to do, like stealing other pirate's gold, food stores and treasures(cards), or giving curses(cards) and blowing each other out of the water. It is also a race, with the winner being the one to balance their finish position with their quantity of gold, plus the treasure and curse cards which give plus or minus points. With four of us, it plays in about 45 minutes.

Considering versatility (2-6 players of virtually any age,) I'm glad this is in our collection. Another strength is that you could feel like you're losing at the start and still win and vice-versa.

The luck in this game is too swingy and brutal to warrant a higher score. In my most recent play, the scores were 28-4-4. The winner won almost because of the treasures they pulled were all favorable, while the second place player had three treasure cards that were all curses and accounted for -9 points. Had those been reversed, the game would have been a lot closer. Still a fun game that I will play whenever and great for the kids because there is no language on the cards, but the shortcomings make this a good, not great, game.

Have used this as a gateway game. Unique game, kinda a roll and move race game with a take that element. But the roll and move aspect is elegantly done so you don't feel the dice are in control. Fun, Fast, and easy to teach. The game mechanics are solid. Even for two players. Jamaica was a tremendous hit with all I have introduced it to so far.

2008 acquisition.  Rating is currently for 2-player games only.

This is a one of the most beautifully made game I own.  From the map to the beautifully illustrated cards, to the way everything fit perfectly together in the box, all make a good impression even before you play the game.

It is also, in my book, a very wife/SO/GF/etc-friendly game.  It has dice (always an important component to the wife) but a manageable randomness the way you can change the order of the dice rolled.  It plays in a relatively short time, and you can choose to be as confrontational or not as you like.

RATING: 7
A fun, hectic racing game with a cool pirate theme. Part strategy and part luck, this game is more about the enjoyment during the race rather then finishing first. Personally I really like the simultaneous action selection element; it really speeds up the game and adds some fun chaos.

There's a take-that element with combat that involves a potential instant-win die-roll. That's usually the one part of the game that gets the most complaints.

Other then that the game has an insert, which is great! The rule book is shaped like a treasure map, which is bad. It sounds fun but is unwieldy in practice. Overall a fun game that's a bit too light to see a lot of play, but still worth keeping and bringing out every once in a while.

Really fun and with an excellent presentation! A pirate race around Jamaica, where players collect treasure, feed their crew and fight their opponents along the way. One of the few racing games where going back is a valid and viable choice (sometimes).

It has a lot of really good ideas, the main three being the dice allocation, the limited storage and the ending.

Every round the main player rolls two D6 and assigns one to the "day" and another to the "night". Each player is holding three cards, each with a "day" and a "night" action. The players pick a card for the round, and each action will be multiplied by the number on the die,

The ships have a 5 slots for storage. Each time you get something you have to fit it in one of them, but if there's no room you have to throw something out.

When a player has made it all the way around the island, the player with the most loot wins! It's not necessarily the one in first place.

Fun!

:star::star::star::nostar::nostar:
There's a lot of neat stuff here, so I'm tempted to bump it up to four stars.

Players are pirates racing around the island of Jamaica. A combination of die rolls and simultaneous card play determines how far you move or how many of the various goods you pick up. Each space has a cost of either food or gold that can send you backwards if you're not prepared. Battles for spaces occur frequently and add some take-that excitement. There's a nice bonus for winning the race (or placing well), but it's no guarantee for winning the game with most gold.

The artwork is cartoony, detailed, and beautiful. The production overall is very nice. It offers a lot of fun and good player interaction. The randomness of the dice and card draws should keep it fresh after repeated plays, even though the play itself may become repetitive.

Definitely a good pick for competitive families.

A nice little race game, with a fair bit of chaos. One player rolls 2 dice indicating a quantity for day and night, then everyone simultaneously chooses 1 card from 3 in their hand which depicts two actions.. these will either be moving forward/backward, or loading goods (food,gold,ammo).. ships that move onto the same space must fight by spending ammo and each rolling a die. The game ends when the first player reaches the finish line, and points are awarded for how far you got, and also how much gold you collected.

Components are very nice, but the gameplay is very light and rather random.

Played 5 times so far, with anywhere from 3 to 6 players.

Wonderfully themed with beautiful graphics and some clever ideas, but after playing it online a few times, it seems as though there's little to no actual strategy or tactics involved.  You could get stuck with no arrow cards at all for a while, or with one arrow card but snake eyes on the dice...  There are some choices that are meaningful, but mostly it's pretty random. I don't mind (and often enjoy) some randomness in a game, but it is quite heavy here.  Regardless, it's really fun in a mostly mindless way and I've enjoyed playing several games online and was happy to pick it up in a trade.  I have no doubt that this would probably be a good "gateway game", and I think it could benefit from a couple of simple variant tweaks to make it a little bit less random for more of a gamer's game.  I think the ideal number of players is definitely 2-4.  With the full measure of 6 it all gets bunched up and there are a lot of battles where everyone loses the things that they need to travel, so I think it goes on a bit long for that many people.  Otherwise, it's definitely fun and plays more fluidly (and still with some good conflict) with 2-4.

The game is about pirates racing around an island, but it's not an actual race game, as the winner is the player with most gold in the end. The idea of attributing dice to day and night actions that are then selected with a single card is interesting, but luck still is a huge factor.

The point swing from treasure cards alone would be enough to ruin it for serious players (there are even cards with negative values), but the occasional combats are even worse. If a player ends a movement on the same space as an opponent, they must battle. They simply roll a die, adding any gunpowder they committed, and compare results, with the winner taking a card or the contents of a cargo hold from the loser. And just to make it more random, there is a die face that is an automatic victory, regardless of how much gunpowder the other player spent.

The very nice card art, cartoony and kid-friendly, adds to the broad appeal of the pirate theme. This certainly can be a good game for families with children, and that seems to be its target audience, but there is just too much randomness to recommend it for gamers.

Eurogame que mezcla algunos conceptos de gestion de recursos con una pura y simple carrera estilo "la oca" pero con interacciones (combates, motines...) que la complican de manera imprevisible para los jugadores. 

Puede ser una introduccion a los juegos de mesa, y la tematica pirata caribeña ayuda, pero algunas normas algo puñeteras y el no haberse distribuido en españa, por otra parte, no ayudan. 

buen juego para lo que yo llamaria "una tarde de domingo". una de esas un poco lluviosas o de atardecida fresca cuando estas en casa sin nada que hacer.

(JAB Mars 2012) Un jeu qui est esthétiquement très beau. Le partage entre l'interraction des joueurs via les batailles navales et la gestion simple de ressources est intéressant. C'est toutefois un jeu qui repose beaucoup sur le hasard (les dés, les cartes pigés) et cela peut s'éterniser en longueur lorsque le dé lancé affiche de trop petites valeurs. C'est un jeu toutefois qui est très accrocheur et intéressant pour les non gamers et ceux qui ne jouent pas souvent.

Great artwork and great components, however the rules aren't very clear and you will have to look stuff up every game and probably on a FAQ. I also think they could have improved the game a lot by adding individual player powers to each pirate.  Also the back side of the player board could have had an alternate map on it to add to the replay value.  A couple of missed opportunities...

As a board game, this is pretty light fare, and heavy on luck of the dice.  But the components (especially the cards) are GORGEOUS!!  I love how the pictures on a card tell a story that match the morning and evening actions on that card.

I should note that the simultaneous action selection mechanic is good, but the non-simultaneous resolution detracts from that somewhat.

Jamaica can be played light-heartedly, or you can start to think about your every move. I disagree the limited card draw add chaos, it is quite the contrary; hand management is crucial if you play for the win. It has gold, gunpowder, ships, treasures, it is fast and fun; the bits and visual design are flawless; Jamaica is up there with the best.This is the game Pirate Cove should have been!

Super fun and interactive racing game involving a pirate ship around the island of Jamaica. Very thematic and strategic based on dice placement and card play. The combat system works, and there is just enough take that without being obnoxious. Better with more players, good for lite gamers or families. Strong recommend.

This is a great 6 player game and can be quite funny. One of the players in my first game refused to take any food and discovered a clever little strategy of gathering gold and using his moves to jump forward then fail to play food and just to the nearest gold. 6 Players was fearce with plenty of gun battles and swapping of treasure holds.... Great game for 6

Very nice, streamlined race-game.
Artwork is fantastic & cutish theme fits. It surely helps to look at the track & your cards before your first play if you wanna win the track.
Also luck plays a part but is not as prevalent as one might think (once you looked at the track and all your cards)

JEM 20. szám: 
Mindenki egy neves kalózt játszik, aki a hajójával minél eredményesebben próbál célba érni. Mindenki kap egy vitorlást 11 akciókártyát és egy hajórakteret ábrázoló lapkát, aminek rekeszeibe áruk he¬lyezhetők el, kezdésként az egyikbe 3 arany, a másikba 3 élelem. 
A táblát, amin a verseny zajlik, előkészítjük: 9 megadott helyre felhelyezünk 1-1 lefordított kincslapkát, a kincskártyákat pedig, amelyeket akkor kapunk meg, ha a kincslapkákat tartalmazó mezőkre lépünk, egy adott helyre, megkeverve és lefordítva. Ezek között találunk olyat, ami sima győzelmi pontot ad; továbbá olyat, ami átkozott, és ezáltal győzelmi pontot vesz el tőlünk a játék végén; és képességkártyákat, amikkel pl. több árut szállíthatunk, stb. 
	Minden játékos felhúz 3-3 akciókártyát a saját készletéből, majd a kezdőjátékos dob 2 és eldönti, hogy melyik legyen a „reggeli”, azaz első akció száma, illetve melyik legyen az „estié”, a másodiké. Kijátszik egy kártyát, a többit visszateszi a saját paklijára, a kijátszott kártyáról viszont mindkét akciót végrehajtja, majd ugyanígy a többiek is óramutató járá¬sa szerinti sorrendben végre¬hajtják mindkét akciójukat. 2 lehetséges akció van: a moz¬gás (előre vagy hátra) és a rakodás (élelmet, puskaport vagy aranyat). Minden körben a kezdőjátékos a saját kártyáira optimalizálja az akciók számát, amit viszont a többieknek követni kell, tehát nekik is ugyanannyi reggeli és esti akciót kell végrehajtaniuk. 
Külön szabályok vonatkoznak a kétszemélyes játékra, ahol a fekete hajó mindig a szellemhajó szerepét játssza el harmadik játékosként, és mozgására eltérő szabályok vonatkoznak. Ha mozgás során üres mezőre lépünk, akkor kifizetjük az ott feltüntetett árat (aranyat vagy élelmet), illetve ritka esetben ingyenes az odalépés, és még egy kincskártyát is kapunk Érdekesebben alakul, ha az érkezési mező nem üres – ekkor ütközetre kerül sor. Ez a játékos eldönti, hogy beveti-e raktáraiból a puskaport (ezek mindegyike 1 pontot ér), és dob a harci kockával, majd ugyanezt megteszi a támadott játékos is, és akinek végül több pontja van, az nyer. Ez egy rend-kívül egyszerű csatamechanizmus, így látszik, hogy nem is ez a játék gerince – valószínűleg azért került bele, hogy megoldja a már foglalt mezőkre érkező újabb játékosok problémáját. A vesztes hajó marad, ahol volt, a nyertes pedig elveheti a vesztes egy rekeszének teljes tartalmát vagy egy kincskártyáját, de akár egy képességet adó kártyáját is. És hogy egy kicsit a kibabrálás szellemét is behozzuk a játékba: a nyertes rátukmálhatja a másikra egy saját mínuszpontos kártyáját. Berakodás során, ha van üres rekeszünk, akkor betesszük az árut, ha viszont nincs, akkor egy rekeszt kiürítünk (visszatesszük az árut a bankba), azonban a kidobott és az újonnan berakodott áru nem lehet ugyanaz. 
A játék akkor ér véget, amikor valaki elér a Port Royal mezőre, azaz megtett egy teljes kört. Ha ezt a reggeli ak-cióval tette meg, akkor az estit már nem hajtja végre, a többiek viszont még végigcsinálják a maguk körét, hogy mindenkinek azonos számú köre legyen. Az a győztes, aki a legtöbb pontot gyűjtötte, ami 3 részből tevődik össze: A célmezőn és az azt megelőző néhány mezőn győzelmi pontszámok olvashatók, ezeket megkapja az, aki ott tar¬tózkodik a játék végén. A gyűjtött aranyanként 1-1 pont. A gyűjtött kincsek, mínusz az elátkozott kártyák pontjai. Ha valaki a -5-ös mezőn vagy az előtt állva fejezi be a versenyt, akkor pontjaiból 5-öt levonunk 

Összességében egy szép kivitelű családi játék, amelyben az egymással való csata illetve kiszúrás nem kapott túlzott mértéket így gyerekekkel is jól játszható (főleg ha fiúk azok, akik vevők a kalózos témákra).

Even though a lot of people like it this game was my biggest disappointment so far. I instantly sold it, after two plays. 

Production quality is top notch, but the gameplay feels boring. When we player first I was way upfront so nobody could stop me. I guess I had just 1 or 2 conflicts with other pirates. When we played second time the cards just ruined everything...I was dead last with no chance of winning at the halfway point.  

The game is good for families with kids, but that`s all. I rather play Formula D.

Fun pirates game. Very easy, everyone can play this. It's best with a large group of 5 or 6. With fewer people there's just not enough interaction and fighting with people. This can have an issue where people can get out of the running of winning based purely on luck of the draw/roll/cards but overall has gone well with most people that I've played it with.

This is definitely a fun game with the right crowd. A game that plays up to 6 players in about an hour time is always a winner in my book. My only gripe is that it may be a little "to light" for many people who are use to games involving more strategy or games that have a little bit more meat. Hence why this game is a perfect gateway/entry level game and it best plays with those who don't take this hobby to seriously. Another great one by Cathala

Not a bad light pirate racing game. Light on strategy (but enough to be interesting), but beautifully produced and lots of fun. Would make a good family game.

There does, however, seem to be a bit of a runaway leader problem - if someone is lucky enough to play two forwards on a double 6, they tend to be in a good position to get the treasures as well as finish first.

A "roll-and-move" game done right. I love the theme of this game: Racing Pirates! Each player represents a different historical pirate. The goal of the game is to simply have the most points by the end of the race. The end is triggered when the first person crosses Port Royal (which is where the race began). But here's the catch. The first person to cross isn't necessarily the winner. You get points by how well you finished (i.e. 1st, 2nd, ect.) AND by how many gold doubloons and hidden treasures you amassed! These are gained by, well, being pirates! Looting each other and all sorts of swashbuckling are highly encouraged.

The components in this game are top notch. No expense was spared (within reason of course, I mean you're not playing with REAL gold doubloons).

December 2015 update: bumping my score up after some more plays. I'm seeing more of the joy in this game. It works brilliantly as a gateway, and the art dazzles every time I get it out. I do still dislike the luck-of-the-draw aspect, though: if only one player has the double-forward card in their hand on a big roll, kiss the game goodbye.

This is a pretty fun little game, although I admit I was hoping for more. I bought it because Sam and Zee (of Dice Tower fame) speak so highly of it so often.

The artwork is absolutely tremendous, the component quality is top notch, the "day/night" mechanic is clever, and it's easy to learn and fairly fun to play. It's a good gateway or filler+.

But since everybody has the same deck, draw order basically determines everything. I often feel like I don't really have much in the way of compelling decisions, and it can have a HUGE runaway leader problem where somebody rockets into the lead and stays there.

It just seems to miss a little bit of "oomph" for me. It's not bad at all, just not as good as I hoped.

First played Feb 26th, 2009. Taught in 10min, played in 45+min with 5 players. Good light game with good luck/strategy mix. Each player is given a ship 3 gold and 4 food to start. Each player has a deck of cards as well(shuffle and start with three). You race around the island of Jamaica with the first back ending the game. Each gold is worth 1pt, there are special VP cards. You also get VPs for how close you finish with 15pts as the max. You can get negative VPs with cards too and even if you don't finish close enought to the finish. There are many spaces around the island. When you land on a space, you are required to pay food (2-4), gold (3-7), pirate space (draw a card), or free space. If you land on a space with another pirate, you attack them with the winner getting one spot of booty (nothing happens in ties). The start player rolls two dice and decide which dice will be the morning and night dice. Your deck of cards has activities on them(movement forward/backwards, get food, get gold, get gun powder) whenever you get a comodity you place it in one of your 5 hull that are empty or toss out what's in there or what you get. Quick easy fun game worth giving a try for those with simple rules.

A simple but very frustrating race game (movement is often forwards & backwards).  Allows for attacking & stealing from fellow players with very simple highest roll wins mechanic.  Meant as a family game, good for younger players, loses it's appeal for repeat plays with older gamers.  Light filler with awkward card mechanic that feels little too long and rapidly becomes repetitive.  The forced combat can be very oppressive and drive away players, never to return.  No interest in ever playing this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Usually when I give a game a 10 rating it is because of the game mechanics and the level of "grit" (challenge/suspense) experienced during play. I don't normally take into consideration artwork, playing pieces or box design. Especially box design. I only take design (eye appeal) and game pieces into consideration before buying a game.  Jamiaca has totally blown me away! Not only in game mechanics but also in the artwork and, AND box design.

The game mechanics, in my opinion, are solid. Even for two players. Play was a tremendous hit with all of us whom have played so far.

The art work is absolutely beautiful. The artist really put a lot of thought into things. For example, the treasure chests on the treasure cards; depending on the point value of the cards the chests look (from varying degrees) barren, to sightly stocked, to overflowing with jewels and gold. 

Lastly, the box. The time that went into the box insert - WOW! There is a place for everything and when the lid is in place you can stand the box up on end or flip it over and everything stays snugly in place. Bravo!

I know of no other game that I own or have played that meets game design/mechanics, artwork and storage consideration. I'm an Axis & Allies die-hard and an very much into similar strategic type games, Jamaica however, as of right now, is my most favorite game.  

I discovered that there were some promo cards that, of course, are no longer available. We'll, that didn't stop me. I made my own. And you can't tell them apart from the original cards available in the game.WOOT! I'll post pictures along with instructions of how I made them in the morning.

Beautiful game, simple to teach and good for family gaming, with some moderately interesting decisions to be made, but I found that if a player gets a lucky early lead they can be next to impossible to catch, which is quite the fun-sucker. I also think I don't really like race games that much. Ultimately, there are other games in my collection that fill this niche better.

It's a pirat's life, so why work if you can let others do the work for ya, Ahoy matey !

The cards and board are just amazingly beautiful.
But this game is so heavily built on luck that it often hurts ;-), which degrades this game to the level of any simple card game I know (i.e. Balloon Cup).
I'll never (ever) ask to play this game but as I like to play games too much I won't easily turn down a session.

Got the game on sale. Just broke it open and it looks very interesting (cool insert also).

EDIT: finally got to play the game. Seems to end at the point you're starting to get into the game but still a nice game overall. Setting it and storing it after is a breeze because of the awesome insert.

Jamaica is a great gateway that is often over looked. I describe it as advanced snakes and ladders, it has enough about it to entertain the more experienced gamers while being simple enough to introduce new players. Not as basic as it first appears, its one I'm glad to have in my collection.

Terrible luckfest. It tries so hard to pretend to have meaningful decisions, which makes it all the more infuriating because it doesn't. In the end, either your cards synergize with the dice and you can move, or they don't and you're stuck burning your cargo or moving backwards. This is so bad I had to walk way from the table, and I haven't quit a game for quality reasons in over a year. Even more so, I'm amazed that this is well-received and Fluxx is a pariah.

This is a beautiful game with fantastic artwork and high quality components which gives it a nice boost in ranking right off the bat.

The most beautiful game I own. Artwork is gorgeous, gameplay is simple and addicting. It's also nice to know that just because someone crosses the finish line first, doesn't necessarily mean they win the game. Great game mechanics of 'should I/shouldn't I' with chits. Added a squid variant that really turns the tables at the end of the game with possibly destroying one of your hulls by a dice roll. BUY THIS GAME.

A richly themed Pirateer; a very elegant race game.  I love the fact that it is a roll-and-move game where every player uses the same roll.  (Players choose different action cards to determine what to do with the roll.)  I disliked the need to discard items from the hold.  I was disappointed that there weren't random encounters with the British navy (I had a lot of cannonballs, but never engaged in combat); we may use the Ghost Ship mechanic even for games with more than 2 players.

This game looks beautiful.  I'm a sucker for great artwork in a game.  I was disappointed that it was essentially a race "around the board" game.  It does have some good mechanics though which do redeem it somewhat.  Maybe if I got it in a trade or for a very good price I would buy it.

Light game, somewhat boring. Definitely for the "fun, arrr!" crowd rather than the serious gamers. Still, even as a "fun" game, it feels slightly slow, repetitive and boring - not a good thing in a game that wants to be quick and action-filled.

Components are fantastic, of course, and in this case add enough piraty feel to make the game tolerable. Still, great components don't make a great game, and Jamaica is no better than average - even for a light-hearted, fun game.

Simple, eligent game.  The design of it is excellent through and through, from the card art all the way to the inserts.
If you play 4 or less people there is no way around the fact that its a racing game and could just be cars driving on a track….but when you play with a full group, that is when the gun powder starts to fly and the pirate theme really seems to come out.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (April 2010)

I dislike racing games AND I dislike pirate games (thanks to merchants & Marauders), so in the theme department Jamaica lost a lot of points with me. Jamaica was one of the first games I ever played, on 2010 I liked almost every game I played, still I didn’t have fun playing Jamaica so I rated it a 5.0 at the time.

The rulebook seems like a treasure map. It seemed like a neat idea at the beginning, but it makes hard to review it quickly, also if you only look the big points you can miss some of the rules explained in smaller letters at the bottom. The game has too much luck for my liking AND it is way too light for me. 

On the good side, the game is gorgeous, the components are very well done, and Jamaica is perfect to play with your family or non-gamer friends. The rules can be explained under 5 minutes.

I don’t expect to buy it ever although I can (perhaps) play again with a boardgame newbie.

Fun point collection / racing game. Very luck dependent - I rolled some absolutely rubbish on the combat dice (and in fairness, made some clumsy plays early on before the mechanics clicked for me) in my only play so far, but I still managed to fluke a win by picking up some high-points treasure cards. 

It's a feature more than an issue, but it means that it's a fun, luck-dependent ride at least as much as it's a game of skill. Just so you know.

Played this with my NBG friends. The first game went very smoothly - although it seemed like they were struggling to get the mechanics a bit, but after one play-through, they seemed to get what the game was about. 

But second play didn't go so well. The action cards that we drew were just too durdly - we aren't really progressing, and just pointlessly fighting each other in the beginning. It was hard to really have any fun, and eventually we called it quits. It's a luck of a die, and drawing the cards, but the progression felt just too limited, and constrained. Maybe there are people who may enjoy this but we didn't. 

+ Surprisingly the same group of friends wanted to play this game again. I still don't really enjoy it, but they seem to enjoy the how light the game was. And the art definitely helped as friends couldn't keep their eyes off their action cards and board.

The latest family game so far to hit my collection. Easy to learn and teach. Played this one with my mother and farther in law and had a blast. Plays well with two and four player's. Four was a much longer game. Nice gateway game with just enough tactics and choice to keep you engaged. 
The box insert is one of the best I've seen and the quality of the pices are top notch... the instructions even open up like a big treasure map.

RATING: 5
This is a really fun racing game. It has pirates and combat and booty. It's somewhat random, between the dice rolling and the card draws, but there are still some interesting decisions. It's light and easy to teach, and it's officially the first game to which my mother's response was, "That was fun, bring that one back."

2015-01-18 - Update: This is still a good game, and great with the right group. It's a little light, though, and sees the table less often because of that. So, I'm lowering my rating from a 7.5 to a 7.

2017-11-06 - I'm not likely to pull this off the shelf over other options anymore. It's just a little too light for me, I think, and the decisions don't interest me very much.

I picked up Jamaica because I didn't have any race games and this one appeared to rate well with reviewers that I trust. Although, my collection tips toward the light side (I play about half the time with novice gamers), I don't have much that is this light. So I thought it could be a good fit for many occasions. Unfortunately, it is a little longer with 5 players (maybe it was partly the players - trying to optimize every play) than I thought it warranted and a little too open and uninteresting for 2 players (even with the Ghost Ship, that won).
I might get a better experience with 3 or 4 players and/or a different group.
So my initial rating may be a bit low and I will revisit after a few more plays and a few more play settings.
Overall, not a bad game, but not as much simple "fun" as I had hoped.

On a turn the player rolls two dice and decides which will be the morning action and which the evening action. Then players select from their top three cards which one to play. Players can use the actions to move, or get gold, food, or cannons. Some spaces make you pay food or gold. When players land on another players ship they can fight. The fight is based on dice rolls but can be modified by cannons. Try to finish first or be near the first place finisher to gain some victory points, and then have plenty of gold for additional victory points. It's a very fun game.

The game artwork is great as well which is something I really appreciate.

Seems like a pretty exemplary family game if there ever was one.  Relatively simple rules, quick playtime, good amount of decision making to keep everyone interested, what more could you ask for?  The theme is pretty thin (and not very relevant), though this is easily glossed over when you see the quality components.  Everyone I've played with has verbally noted the high quality of the artwork and components - they are truly very well done.  I've only played with 4 players, but I'd like to try with 5 or 6, since it seems like a good game for a larger group, both in terms on interaction and lack of significant added downtime.  There's nothing terribly new or original about the design, but it seems like a game that would improve with further play and I look forward to playing this a lot more.

WORST RULEBOOK EVER. Honestly, of all the hundreds of games I have played, I have not come across the sheer stupidity of a publisher who has made the mistake of a fold-out rulebook like this.

That aside, the game itself is quite fun. It's a very simple light filler, but the components really sell the theme. Players are pirates racing around Jamaica trying to balance between gunpowder, food and gold.

My one gripe (aside from the rulebook idiocy) is that the action deck is pretty small and gets reshuffled too often in a game. And because each player has the same deck, it often ends up that players mimic each others move. Otherwise a solid, not-too-thinky race game to kill some time.

Leads can be deceptive in this game and you must straddle the line between offense and defense carefully.  Planning and resource management is crucial in preparation for what may come your way.  

Components are top notch, the art is wonderful, and the gameplay is very rewarding.  New players tend to struggle on their first play, not understanding that they only have 1 of those "double green arrow" cards to spend. The rule book, while thematic, should not have been a treasure map.  Referencing the rules feels like holding up a giant newspaper.  

You should have this game if you want a more complex race game.

Just one play.  I enjoyed myself, more than I guessed I would.  In many ways this seems to be the game Piratenbucht ought to have been.

For a light-hearted pirate romp, I'd say this is the game to get.

I love this game, but would like more battles. I suggest playing with the pirate ghost ship even in multiplayers as it increase the numbers of battles.

One great experience, and one painful one so far.  This is a great medium to light weight family game for up to 6 that plays quickly and has art that is second to none.  Great theme, great bits, fun play.  I think this will go up over time but we will need some positive plays to prove it.

Replaced Pirates Cove for me as a light Family style Pirate themed game. I think it takes a second play to appreciate more as during the first play you don't realize as much just how fast you could move forward if you wanted to ( save your double green arrow card for that five/six roll).  Even then it's not so simple a decision as there is treasure and wealth gain that need to be balanced a bit against simply springing ahead the fastest.

There is some randomness in the treasure card draw but overall it has a satisfying amount of meaningful decisions for a lighter game (Even the good old 'Do you let the negative backward movement card(s) clutter up your hand or do you play them anyway at an opportune time to help maximize your choices later on?'.

I've also picked up Black Fleet so will have to see if there is room for both in our collection or not.  Certainly for a heavier pirate themed game there is Merchants and Mauraders.

I have read the rules and here is what I like for the family.

Does not seem too complex.
Good race around the board and I like the mechanics.
Beautiful board, and should play about 1 hour to 1.5 hours it looks like.
Some Luck, but enough decisions to make to help balance that out.
It appears to have good components.

Just NOT quite hitting the sweet spot for the family, I seem to be the only one requesting this game.

I've played this both 2p (without the 2p variant, woops!) and 3p and thought it was a great game.  It's really light but plays super quick and is incredibly easy to teach.  Definitely one that'll stay in my collect as light fair to get the night going or to play with newer gamers.  I expect it'll be good to play with my kids when they're a bit older too.  The rulebook as a map was a really fun idea, but in actual use is awful.

A fun family racing game with a pirate theme. The movement selection phase is really fun. The combat was a little lacking for me, and the game has a lot of "take that" aspects to it. At times this game felt like a multiplayer solitaire when everyone got so spaced out. Still was fun though!

Light racing game, I absolutely demolished the competition first time playing just by racing ahead.

The "reroll" power seems to be very poorly balanced, making it almost impossible to beat the individual who owns this.  The fix is simple, spent cannons should count for both rolls.

Very pretty board though, and beautiful artwork on the cards.

Very good gateway family game. High on luck and close scores. However you have some things to consider so it's not a roll and move.

RATING: 5.5
I had high expectations for this game and I won't mention what they were based on. When you here the rules explained- the game sounds like it is ideal. Quick, light and yet somehow strategic. 

Unfortunately all decisions you make have very small impact on your success. First, because of the battle dice roll. You could build your strategy around winning fights by gathering powder. But then it often doesn't matter because the dice can easily negate all your efforts. It's just random. Second- this "luck" thing is totally present in every aspect of the game. You have no real influence on your fate, because the way other players allocate the action dice is based on their hand and you can't choose to play any other cards than one of the three you randomly draw from the deck. So you often end up doing something against your will because you have no other option. 

Overall- beautiful game, but it's really nothing more than luck. Which is a shame because it could have been a great game if only some rules were slightly changed.

Played once, 4 players.  First of all, this is a light family game.  DO NOT get this game expecting it to be the end all be all of pirate games.  This game is dominated by luck; luck of the dice, luck of the card draw for your move, luck of the card draw for the treasures.  There's also considerable double think, as you try to either initiate or avoid combat.  That said, it would probably be a great family game.  I'm not a family game player, so it's "ugh" for me at best.  I should also say that the components and artwork are super.

A neat little light "pirate racing" game with simultaneous card plays but not really worth the exorbitant price tag that comes along with it.  Great artwork and nice looking game tho.

It is nicely produced, but I found it not to be my favorite type of game to play.  There's a good bit of good natured fighting if two or more ships are on the same space but it is primarily dependent upon a single die roll.  Since when have pirates really raced?  It is very simplistic to play.

I want to like this game more but I guess is too long and too random.  Most times I've played have been 5 players (I have yet to play with 6), I feel like there is too much down time between turns which really lowers the enjoyment factor.  Also, I wish there a "good" way to spend low rolls other than on "backwards".  Players who are getting lots of low rolls don't get a chance to do as well.

Kicsit zavaró, hogy elviszik az ember elől a kincseket, meg hogy ezerrel hajtani kell előre, hogy ne kapjak egy rakás mínusz pontot ha nem én érek célba először. Mindenért fizetni kell, a csatákban pedig kirabolhatnak - csupa-csupa negatív élmény.
A két dobás és az időbeliségük eldönthetősége viszont tetszik, ahogy a tengeri csata lebonyolítása is (kockadobással, meg esetleg felhasználva a puskaporunkat, de mindent überelhet, ha csillagot dobunk).

Don't play this game with only 2-3 players.  It really shines with 4-5.  I haven't tried it with 6.

This game is good if you have kids.  Otherwise, it's a family game, with light strategy (you do end up with interesting choices, but not too many or anything).  It's probably the best race-condition game.

What it really has going for it is theme.  It's really fun to look at, and move your little pirate ship around, and try to snag each other's booty (not while the children are looking, however!).  

It's funner if you're playing with light-hearted people who are going to play along with the pirate theme and make all sorts of remarks and not take things too seriously.  It wouldn't be very fun to play with a serious strategy game group.  Waaaay too random for that.

So it's a good game for what it is: a light, pirate-themed family game (so long as you play with at least 4 players).  But I do think Tom Vassel over-touted this one.

good, fast and easy to set up and teach, works well with kids and non gamers, it's on the light side, luck has it's weight but you need a clear strategy to stay ahead of the pack.

RATING: 5
Not really my cup of tea. Very good components, lot of eye candy going on. Will probably impress non-gamers. Sadly the game play itself leaves a bit to be desired. One of the guys I game with made the comment he'd like it a lot more if you had a ton of cards in your hand to choose from each turn rather than just drawing one new card and I completely agree. I'd consider playing again just to try it with everyone having your whole set of cards to choose from each turn and see how that goes. If everyone decided to move forward on a 6 then you'd have a ton of battles to deal with. Could just make things a bit more interesting.

Very light, chaotic fun.  Jamaica is a family-friendly race game that emphasizes luck over strategy.  It's a great time with the right crowd (my heavy gamer friends seem to dislike this).

Fast and fun Pirate game, which is good for a laugh but not to be taken too seriously.  Seem to do OK at this one, whereas others seem to really struggle to get round the course - perhaps they are more interesting in fighting each other, but it is a race!

RATING: 6
The hand management of your actions both only being able to use each once or twice and also having to occasionally use an action that is actually bad for you causes some hard choices to have to be made in the game. At the same time the game is very accessible (albeit a bit too light for its game length) both in terms of easiness of rules and actually being good with 6 players.

I also like the need to manage your resources in able to move, as it feels realistic and also makes you sometimes have to choose with performing a mad dash or going slow and steady.

One negative I have of the game however is that it seems like gold isn't very useful early (and at times you might have to play a card that gives you gold early due to your limited card options), as often that just puts a huge target on your back for other people to plunder you.

RATING: 7.5
Very fun family game. Love the pirate theme and the racing. Easy to teach and play, and it's fast.  Light game but with enough decisions to make that's its not a simple roll and move and the resource management mechanics work well. The dice and luck aspects also level the playing field when playing with younger gamers. Scores well with all of us.

Great looking race game with fun mechanics and theme. Some players have frustration with not be able to work out how to best use their rolls and blame the game - I'm not so sure, but 'maybe'.

RATING: 6
A friend's game I've played a few times. I like the theme and the idea I think the rules are going for, but the games never seem to turn out that way.

Finishing moderately ahead of the others is such an enormous points boost that it always becomes the priority. Conflict isn't common enough due to reliance on dice rolls for movement.

I enjoy playing it, but it won't join my collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Great looking board.  Nice race game with more to victory than just winning the race(your gold gives you points also).  The dice mechanic is pretty unique.  It's a light hearted superfiller that has some minor decisions(most of the time, an optimum card-play will surface); but it supports 6 without slowing down too much which a big plus. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I enjoyed this, although it was quite a luch fest and it seemed quite difficult to get started. I kept going for treasures but ended up with loads of cursed ones, but managed to win because I took a massive load of doubloons and finished the race. I will play it with our friends who own it but not in a massive hurry to get it myself.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice quick game. Easy to teach to casual player. Every one likes the pirate ship theme. Can suffer from a runaway leader syndrome if new players are not careful in their choice of cards (using their double move when it counts).

Pros:
- Nice components
- easy to teach and thematic
- I really like that there is some combat!

Cons:
- runaway leader problem
- might be problematic if the same pirate gets beaten a lot

Racing game with pirate theme.  I really like the execution of dice in this one.  It gives you flexibility and variance without complete randomness.  I also appreciate how there really is no one set way to win; the race can be important, but treasures could be too, or even just sitting on fat stacks...

The first time I played this I gave it a 5. The people I played with took forever to make decisions bogging the game down. A racing game should not take an hour and a half. 
Bumped this up to a 7 after playing with a different group. I think the rating will go up as people get more familiar with the cards and mechanics. 

Edit: I still don't care for this one. A racing game shouldn't be so slow. Also, the fun is killed by low dice rolls.

RATING: 4
This game is well regarded, but I really don't like it.  It is the most boring racing game I have ever played.  I have played it and found that racing around the board as quickly as you can is a dominant strategy.  Attacking other players to get gold and treasure is an easy way to lose.  I found it stunningly boring and if it goes out of print, will sell it.  

Component quality gives this a higher rating than the game play should warrant.

A family game that is fun. Lacking a bit of strategy at times, and not as many fights as a pirate theme would let you imagine. Hopefully, the extension brings some of that back.

I know a lot of people go for the artwork on this title. It doesn't seem to do much for me though. I do like that you can arrange the cards to get an interesting panorama but the art style isn't to my taste.

Sadly I'm not very enthused with the game play either. The choices seem limited and uninteresting, sometimes decided by luck of the draw or dice roll more than anything. The rules for taking on cargo are a little iffy with me too.

Only played a 4 person game of this. I can see this being a really great gateway game when we have people who are not into gaming come over and want to try something. The mechanics are pretty simple and the art is truly wonderful. 

For 'experienced' gamers, the decision making isn't that incredible. I could feel myself getting a bit bored with the game the second play through. But I'll still keep it because I think it will work great with non-gamers

Extremely fun.  Not a serious brain burner here.  This is just pure, random, silly fun.  The art is beautiful.  The bits are amazing.  The game is like a work of art.  Easily accessible to anyone and fun to play.  Worth picking up if you can still find it.

Multiple levels of luck with very little strategy makes this game somewhat interesting for light and non-gamers but not a whole lot of fun when other options are around. There are very few decisions to make and the game does drag a bit. Not a game I'd likely play again.

Modern kind of goose game. Throw the dice and advance. Sometimes you need to fight with your opponent. Or you have to go back because you don't have enough food.

On the fence about trading this away, but I might keep it for large all-age game gatherings.  It's a decent game for new gamers or kids, but there is little here for adults who are familiar with modern board games.  The choices are simple and often obvious.  It is easy to break the game by going forward to a spot you cannot afford in order to get sent back to space that has treasure.  The combat where you can add gunpower works sometimes, unless it means that there is a 5 in 6 chance the victor is determined in advance of the die roll.

This game has a lot going for it, but it needs a little help. At it's core, Jamaica is just a beefed up, roll and move, racing game. There's a few decisions to make, but nothing to write home about. You need to add a little bit to make Jamaica work. Simply sitting down at the table, and staring at the board the whole game will make it seem quite dry and boring. You need to talk in pirate voices, goad other players into fighting you, cheer when you take the lead, etc. Nothing over the top, just add a little excitement to this game to make it come to life, and it works great!

Fun game! Unfortunately, our second game took well over 2 hours to play (with 5). I really only want to play this game if it can be played in less than 90 minutes. However, because there are not a set number of rounds, the game can vary quite a bit. We noticed that if you try to burn though your resources to get to the finish line and don't save enough for the final stretch, you can be left marooned on one of the last islands for a LONG time. It's sad that such  a simple, family-style game can be so unforgiving. That's my main beef with this game. Outside of that, it's really great.

The artwork in this game is incredible and vibrant! One of the most visually appealing games in my collection. I love the pirate theme as well. It's a bit too lightweight for me, as mechanically it's an easy to learn racing game. But it's a great gateway game.

Received 08/21/08

Opened and punched. Artwork is, as expected, just simply awesome. Rules are a not very functional.  They fold out into a large poster so using them at the table to check rules is going to be a pain.

Okay...don't expect anything deep here but it's still fun.  You're always at the mercy of your cards and how the captain assigns the dice but hey...the game isn't rocket science.  You just bash your way to the end and hope for the best.  Obviously with more people you're going to be battling more.  

My one complaint is that the 'star' battle die is a killer and feels too powerful.

New complaint: The box is rather thin and has already split at two corners. And I'm even very careful with my games.

Jamaica is a fun pirate themed racing game.  In it players race their pirate ships around the island of Jamaica, while trying to feed their crew, gain treasures, and fight off other pirates!  The winner is not necessarily the one who gets around the island first, but the one who has gotten the most points.  Points are determined by your place at the end of the race, and how much gold and certain treasures you've found along the way.

This is arguably the most beautiful game ever produced.  The components and artwork are so very nice.  The game is fast and fun, and I really enjoy it.  It's the best race game I've ever played.  I highly recommend Jamaica to everyone.  Also, it makes for a great family game!

I bought this one because it looked beautiful, and it is! Gameplay is rather light though and based largely on luck and the rules come as a fold-out treasure map, which is a neat concept that embraces the theme, but is ridiculous in function. I'll play this if someone else wants to and is excited about it. Lots of folks want to play this one for its beauty, but it's never been requested a second time by anyone in our game group.

The first time I played I looked at the board and it seemed that the points earned for reaching the end first overwhelmed the points earned for anything else.  So, I played to finish first above all else and won in a landslide.  That doesn't sit well with me because it makes me think the game was not tested properly.  If in future plays I determine that I was wrong, I will raise the rating.

Simple, pleasant enough but, ultimately, uninvolving piece of fluff that would work well with youngish children. 

Roll two dice, decide which die represents the day action and which the night action. Play a card from your hand and take the actions shown (collect goods/treasures or move forward/back). Pay any costs from your holds if required by the space you land on. Battle other pirates if you land on their space.

If I had some kids, I might consider this as a family game because the artwork is nice and the piratical theme is quite fun with a 'take that' combat element and I guess that you'd enjoy it as a parent just to see the kids having a great time. 

The day/night action mechanism is nice and there are various ways to earn points as you race your ships around the island, but there are better race games for grown-ups.

My first racing game, and wow, I absolutely loved it. Gorgeous, easy and yet with strategy, fun involved in so many ways, interesting, with some confrontation, push your luck elements... Loved it, excelent game, it is not higher because it is kind of meh with only 2 players, and sometimes it is really short.

RATING: N/A
Traded for Quarriors! after a very disappointing first play. Between the dice rolls and the cards you draw, there really aren't a lot of interesting choices to be made. This, combined with the lack of player interaction, results in a fairly boring game. The player with the lucky card draws and dice rolls will usually win. I expected more from you, Jamaica!

I don't usually really care for racing games,but Jamaica surely is a lot of fun. If you're looking for a heavy pirate game, go see Merchants&marauders, but if you're looking for some easy fun with great components AND a pirate theme, take a look at this.

Very nice looking and fun racing game.  I'm glad to play it and enjoy it, but the degree of randomness in it and lack of control is a little too high for me to rate it higher.  Very clever combination of card and dice use, though.

Around the island we go picking up treasure, firing our cannons and feeding our crew.
Beautiful game, you are making choices but they are limited. I did play 2 player with the ghost ship and it felt more tactical but its a 4+ player game at its core. 
Fun and nice game to play with kids and relatives around the holidays. I find even if a player is in last place with all his goods stolen still has a chance but only if he goes all out with desperate moves and lucky attack dice.

The Dice Tower seem to be fans of this game, but I think it is just pretty solidly OK.

I can't fault the artwork and production, it's really excellent. The gameplay is where the game let me down. Sometimes the choice of dice order or card is interesting, but most of the time it's pretty automatic. You might be lucky to have a great hand, or unlucky to be stuck with useless cards.

I think there are better pirate games and better race games.

Really enjoy this game, it's gorgeous, has great components, scales well. I like that it balances things out between what position your ship is in and how much gold/treasure you have in your cargo, making it possible to stand in last place and still come out first or second overall due to your treasure.

Really hope the treasure mini-expansion gets a reprint at some point so the treasures can get a bit more variety.

Can roll and move be fun? It's hard to believe, but Jamaica makes it work. The day phase and night phase actions are the magic here. It feels simple enough, but the layers of decision in choosing the cards to play, and choosing how to arrange the dice, keeps even the experienced gamers engaged.

Fun, Fast, great pieces and easy to teach making it one of my top gateway games and it goes to 6 which I need when we have two other couples over who are not big gamers.  The confrontation is light so people don't get bent out of shape but still adds to the interaction. There is some strategy in there in what cards to play yet people who are new can still do well.  It is not extremely deep, but it is perfect in design for what it does.

Family LOVES this one, but I'm kind of meh.  Absolutely gorgeous, easy to teach and play, but to me it ends up being a little too luck-based.  Don't get me wrong, there are decisions to be made which will affect your game, but in the end, if you don't have the right cards/dice rolls at the right time, you can't do much about it.
Obviously it's intended to be a family game, so I can look past that, but it just doesn't get me going.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Jamaica's a game with a lot of lighthearted fun and amazing artwork that's a delight to look at as the game goes on, but it falls into a weird category of games for me. It's very light - it's as light as you might want a filler micro game to be that takes maybe 15-20 minutes tops. There's almost no decision making, you're pretty much along for the ride in this game. It's a decently fun ride, but it being so light but taking an hour or sometimes more to play, by the end you're wishing it would end already. The combination of this game being so light but taking so long for such a light game means it has a hard time getting to the table over other games. If I want a light game I'm usually wanting a quick one, or quick ones are just more attractive. If I want a long game I want one with substance and decision making.

This game is great fun for one playthrough and no more. That one playthrough is a fantastic experience, between the elegant mechanics and the spectacular artwork, but while the mechanics are elegant they just aren't enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I want to love this game. The artwork on the board and cards are terrific! But the game itself is not very deep. Maybe I'm missing something after only one play, but it seemed very chaotic and lucked based with not enough decision making going on. I at least want to try it again...

AT LEAST 2

Played this with SS today and although it was fun, it felt really fiddly because I played "bank" and handled all the gunpowder, doubloons and food. Shoulda set them out in the tray but the table was crowded. Another fiddly part was the whole "roll dice then choose which card then play the card face down then turn the card face up". I'm sure this would've been mitigated with more than 2 players, but putting a card facedown only to reveal it a second later felt silly.

All this criticism is also probably borne of the fact that we played Samurai first. (see Samurai notes)

I actually enjoyed this much better when I played solo with the black ship variant.

This is an almost perfect light, family game - it is really well implemented.  A round starts by rolling 2 dice. The active player chooses the order with which all players use the dice.  Then all the players pick a card which best advances their position given the dice positions.  The movement is fun and interesting.  The combat is simple yet engaging.  The exploration aspects (with the treasure tiles) are also alluring and interesting.  Jamaica does everything really well!  It is light - really light even - but for what it is, it is first in it's class.

Jamaica, ehrm.. "Aargh ho ho ho and a bottle of... why is the rum gone!!?" Basically Jamaica is a racing game with pirate ships and cannons. You try to race around the island and fill your ship with gold. You also need food to feed your crew and cannonballs to fight your rivals. This isn`t merely a roll and move game but dice rolls determine how many commodities or gridmovements you can spend in the morning and in the evening. Every player can then program which antions they eill do by playing a card that illustrates the wanted actions.

Jamaica is a simple game but fun and theme works for me better than in for example Formula D.

Jamaica is mainly a racing game, but it plays out with a much more piratey gusto then one might expect. Using a clever system of dice and cards to determine how many of the two actions you get too do. On the way you will blast and steal from your opponents, while trying to maintain enough speed to get into that scoring zone. A fantastic and easy to learn game despite the unwieldy instructions.

So I was OK with the idea of having another lighter game that I could use with people not identifying themselves as gamers. The result is that from now on, whenever I'll read consistent opinions in the line of "not ultra-deep but fun and clever family-friendly game", I'll translate to "barely better than Monopoly". Components are lavish and the box insert is the best one I've even been exposed to as I write this; but in the end, a random luckfest dumbing down choices that appeared to be moderately interesting in theory.

This game is a delight to look at with great components and fun artwork. It starts a bit slow for a race game with players fairly bunched up.

Because I don't know how well it plays with two players I'm not sure about getting it, but because of it's light fast paced nature, it's cool theme, and great components, this racing game appeals to me more than most others and I really want to try it. If I liked it a lot, I may get it.

-----------UPDATE

OWN IT. Great great GREAT fun racing game. Everything I wanted in a pirate game and in a racing game. Now I have an accessible game that's fun and easy for everyone that's still interesting, has some strategies, an inlay for the box that actually works perfectly, cool art, great simple mechanics, and a good flow.

For what this game is trying to be, it achieves it perfectly. If you like pirate, racing, or casual games that are still board games and not party games, this 30-60 minute game is a complete winner!

I haven't played many race games before so I don't have much to compare with. Overall I enjoyed playing Jamaica. There's an abundance of Caribbean themed games but I like it and I'm not tired of it yet. It was pretty stressful and tense to puzzle together the balance between gold, movement and whether to attack or avoid attacking.

A pretty short game, around an hour, but any more and I think it would have overstayed its welcome.

The rules were more complex than I thought even though it's a pretty light weight game. However, once you get playing it's fairly easy.

The rulebook is a disaster! Who thought that making the rulebook a map was a good idea? The rules are well written but the fold out map is horrible.

The old box artwork is way better than the new.

This wasn't for me and I can't say I'd rush back to give it another try. There's a very high level of production in play here and the components are top notch, but the game itself just felt way too haphazard and not like I had anywhere near enough control for how the game wanted to be played. Perhaps I missed the point, but it didn't really seem like anyone walked away from our game all that enthused or entertained by it.

A gorgeous game with simple rules that is easy to learn and quick to play.
 
I detest dice. Although this game is dependent on dice, all players share the same die rolls, (except in combat). Players use the few cards they have in their hands to make the best use of each roll to progress around the board, which takes some of the randomness out of the dice.

Has an excellent box insert that stores all components separately and securely. The instruction manual, while thematic, is as awkward as one of those fold-out road maps.

Unfortunately, the play really does feel like you are always trying to choose the least harmful of a small array of bad options. That, and the fact that, as in all racing games, there really is only a single path to victory, which limits replayability.

----------------Preliminary thoughts----------------

A simple racing game with an added theme (it could have been any other) and some obstacles and prizes over the course.

It has some cool mechanics, but they doesn't seem to make it an strategic game, as some claim. I think the dice rolls will be decisive in every game.

The art and the components are really high level.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a sort of racing game. Not a pure racing game as you can win without being in first position. Actually you could win by being in the last position in the "race".

Mechanically the game is a hidden action selection with dices deciding how valuable actions are (dices are thrown first so you know them). In movement you need to balance between gold and food to be able to get ahead. You'd also like to have some cannons to be able to enchance your odds in battles (one throw of a die for both parties). There is a high luck factor especially in battles and especially with 6 players. You cannot know for sure how other will move and you might be forced to have battles you don't want.

The game is chaotic with 6 players but it definitely needs at least 4 to be fun and I'd prefer to play with 5 or 6 when given chance. Not for too serious gaming but a fun racing game.

I've upgraded my original rating from 7 after playing with my family, the way the game should be played.  Originally, I had played with hard-core gamer friends who took it way too seriously.  If played quickly, with a light, fun-loving attitude, this game is great.  Because of the dice and random card draws, it has the added advantage of allowing players at the lower end of the recommended age range to have a chance of doing well, or even winning.  Final note:  The production quality basically couldn't be any better.  This game looks tremendous.  I'm very happy to have it in my collection.

RATING: 7
Rated after one play.

The components and packaging are fantastic... this is an exemplar of great component design, especially the molded insert... never seen one better. (Important Exception is the rules, which thematically unfolds like a big treasure map but is pretty annoying to read in the first place or to use as a reference during a game.) The art is absolutely gorgeous... I am floored by the paintings.

The game (played with 3 others) was okay, but players didn't seem to feel like they were really "doing" anything. The player who won didn't feel like she had done anything particularly clever to earn the win, and the rest of us felt similarly about our unsuccessful performances.

It's a decent game with bonus points for sheer beauty. I would like to try it again, perhaps with younger (read: 8-12 year-olds.) I think it could function well with players of that age, or mixed between that age and older.

[i]Wow, what a bummer this game was, I really don't get the hype that surrounded this game. Note to self... don't believe the hype surrounding OOP games! (I find it quite interesting that now that the game has been reprinted all the hype has dissipated and I don't hear anyone talking about this game). My family and I were bored playing this game, the decisions are very basic and straight forward. 

While this should be a great gateway game, it plays way to long for the amount of depth it has and is not a game I want to play again.[/i]

[i]First I need to mention that the production quality is top notch with great artwork. We all had fun playing, but I have to admit that due to all the hype surrounding it I was a bit underwhelmed. I can't put my finger on it maybe I was just expecting more from the game. It is a very simple game to play and teach and there are decisions to be made, but they do not require deep thought.[/i]

The quality of the Jamaica components is excellent.  The artwork on the box, board and cards is very attractive.  Even the cardboard coins are nice to look at.  I like the fact that of the characters one can chose to play, all are actual historical figures.  Two of these are even female!  Although this is basically just a race around the board, there are lots of elements that keep it from being dull.  For one thing, the separate day and night phases of each turn, the risk of finding cursed treasure as you seek to augment your score, the challenge of keeping yourself supplied with the essentials (food, gold and gunpowder) with only limited space in your hold, and the menacing presence of the ghost ship (in the two-player game, the only one I've played).  My maiden voyage was a little long, but that was largely my own fault.  I'm sure with people who have played the game before, things move along at a snappier pace. (4+3)

This is one gorgeously produced awesome game! This is one great pirate race! The unique card mechanic is simple and fun. The treasures are fun with both good and cursed treasures. Wonderful battle mechanic too! The first player rolls 2 D6, the results become the day and night conditions. Each player plays a card with the intention to move forward or backward, get food, get cannons, or gold. What ever card is played determines your turn events. Sometimes you move, sometimes you collect things. Whenever a player lands on a space with another player a battle must take place, allowing the winner to steal from the other ships holds...or give the loser your cursed treasure...Arrrgh! Certain board spaces require payment in food or gold. So planning is wise in holding your cards. The person with the most points in gold wins!

Okay but am not a big fan of pirate games although this one was not trying to be desperately wacky like most. Disliked the goofy artwork on the action cards, which themselves seemed unnecessarily cumbersome as they only needed two symbols. Quite a bit of downtime too. The finite resources rule was odd and seemed a tacked on rule to overcome limited tokens. Fun enough but random, with each move dependent on the card you play synching with the dice rolled.

RATING: 6
While it's perhaps a touch too far to say that this game plays itself, your choices are constricted and your fate is in the lap of the dice gods. Your cards have a left side and a right side with a symbol in each - food, gold, cannons, movement. Play one of your 3 cards secretly, the start player rolls 2 dice and allocates 1 left, 1 right, and whatever he placed, that's what you get from your card when you reveal. So if you play a move/move and a 6/5 gets rolled, happy days and you're well on the way to completing the lap of the board that's required (VPs are earnt depending how far you get around when the first player gets home). If he rolls a 1/1, you're in deep stoop because you only have so many move cards and your best one's wasted. That's the game. Most spaces require payment in gold or food, otherwise you move backwards until you hit a pay-free spot, so you need to consistently load up. Cannons you'll use whenever you land on someone or someone lands on you - each one can add 1 to your die in the dice-off that follows, winner gets to steal stuff from the other. So the game is 2 steps forward, 1 step back all the way, and occasionally 1 step forward, 2 steps backwards. It's fluffy and goes decently fast and if you like dice-based races, this is a nice twist on the genre. Just don't emotionally invest though.

As a pirate game, it's not very piratey (if that's a word) - there's no plundering and not much shooting. Under the gorgeous artwork is a "race around the island game", but not a bad one at that. It's very light, but that makes it a good choice when the non-gamers are round and we want an alternative to Monopoly - good for kids as well.

I can't say I've ever played anything like this game. I thought it'd be in the category of card-driven race games, but I was wrong. Players are racing pirate ships, deciding dice roll allocations through simultaneous programmed action selections, managing their hands and small card decks, tracking their cargo hold inventory, fighting opponent ships, and looting treasures. Very cool and original game, methinks. Might be comparable to Formula E.

Not the best 2-player; better with more. Casual Game. Family Game. Church Group Game. Beer-N-Pretzels Game.

RATING: 7.2
Used to be one of my favourites (rated it 9.2) but the last two times I played it felt a bit boring.

Of course the artwork and the production is fantastic.

I also like the ghost ship rules for 2 players. I am thinking of using the ghost ship even with 3 or 4 players. I feel it prevents situations where one player takes the lead and never looks back.

I think my main problem with the game is that it feels too simplistic for experienced gamers and yet somehow it feels a bit too complex for newcomers. Also the constant back and forth of the food, canon and coin tokkens, round after round, can become tiresome. Rolling one die for batlle is kind of disappointing. I wanted sth more there.

Once everyone gets the feeling of the game everything moves faster and feels lighter.

Maybe I forgot how to enjoy this game. I used to play The Pogues music or Pirates of the Caribean OST while playing. I'll try it again. Let's see what the expansion has to offer!

(Wife's Point of View: She loved it once. Then she got into Ticket to Ride and Dixit and though she is still OK with it, we don't get to play it that often. Good with 2-p)

A goof game for non-gamers and gamers alike. You always have some control of what you are doing, but also need to watch out for others and play the best card given the roll. Also, one of the best produced games I have seen, from art to insert, like it was made for a picky gamer! Although the game gets a little long with too many players.

It's an ok game, but nowhere near deserving of all the praise from The Dice Tower crew.  I played with 6 and the game sorely outwore its welcome.  I could see it being more tolerable at 4.  Some call it a party game.  But I just don't see that.  "Hey everybody.  It's Friday night.  Let's go over to Dave's house and put on some music, bust out some drinks, and play that game with simultaneous card selection." Uhhh....no.  I could see it as a light family activity, but there are games that fit that roll far far better.

It's not AS bad as I thought it would be, but it's a really light racing game with some very basic card selection. I'd like to try it once with the full player count, but it might just be too long and too random.

RATING: 2.5
A racing game, where you're traveling around an island, feeding your crew, collecting treasures, attacking other ships and lotting gold. In the game, you're selecting through 3 action cards, which have two actions (one for the morning and one for the evening), and to decide how much you're going to do from your action, you're throwing dice.

It's a game quite dominated by luck, as battles are also decided by a single die (adjusted by the number of the cannons you have). It's light, ok to play, but too much luck for me and not enough fun.

This is a simple, yet fun pirate game.  Sadly, it's probably one of the best pirate games out there.  It's highly interactive, many different paths to win, little downtime, and a lot of fun against your opponents.

The game can have big swings and some of the treasures are over powered and transfer players.  If looking for a "more serious" pirate game, this might not satisfy you.

Just played twice solo.  Looks like a good beer (or rum!) and pretzels game.  Ships trudge forward more than advance forward as they are being slowed by running out of food and gold chits required to sail into certain areas, and then combat which can happen frequently multi-player just by sharing a sea space with another ship, and can gain or lose your ship food or gold (or Treasure Cards) taken from you as booty if you lose combat.  Should be fun playing with the right crowd.

Not too bad a game.  Has some fairly balanced mechanics, and is actually pretty fun.  Though, of course, the solid mechanics (use of holds, everyone has own deck, payment for food vs. gold) are knocked for a big loop by a lot of luck (the "auto-win" battle die, treasure draws, and, to a lesser extent, cards in hand when game nears end) and chaos (day vs. night die choices).  It's also got a lot of fiddly rules, which I suspect makes it difficult to "get" for newbies.  Still, it's fun and doesn't take very long.

Nice little family game, which has good enough mechanics to  put it well above your regular family fair. There is quite a bit of luck on the game, which makes it possible for someone to take the lead and leave everyone behind, but this actually requires many of the players to not make proper use of their cards. The components and the artwork on this game are superb, and I have seen very few titles I think look that good when put into their box insert.
Lastly, the only drawback of the components is that the action cards are non-standard size, and for someone like me that sleeves everything, that is a small annoyance. Edit -- I found sleeves for this.

I fly in the face of conventional wisdom on this game. I prefer it with just two players, where you have more control, than with more players, where things rapidly get chaotic.

A very simple game that works well with up to 6 players. It's actually more fun with more players and I would not play this with less than 4 players. 

The game sometimes feel like it lasts longer than it should so the end is a bit boring. The game is also very dependant on what cards you draw and dice you roll. This lessens the problem with AP, but it makes the game feel very random. 

The pieces are great and it works very well for family gamers or people liking a bit fluffy games. I will play this again, but it will not be among my favourites.

Beautiful game, wonderfully thematic. One of my favorites for small groups. It is a racing type game with a unique but familiar roll and move mechanic. The Night and Day portion is awesome, and allows from some really interesting plays. The game is quick paced as everyone plays every turn, and it works great with 4+. Did I mention the theme? Beautiful when set up. The box is a treasure chest, and the back of the rules has gold printed on it. The cards art all match the effect AND they go together to make a picture. So cool.

RATING: 7
A one lap race around the titular island in which you have to pay food/gold where you stop otherwise go back to where you can cough up. First past line ends game, with pts for placing plus coins in your storage equals vp score. Although it has Pirates Cove production values, this game provides a similar pirate experience in a shorter playing time, and is more of a resource management game as you only have limited storage and must discard excess (unless you pick up a spare space from landing on a treasure token). There are fights involving powder and a die roll, allowing the victor to pillage a storage space/treasure. Interesting action pt system via dice roll and card played. May well fit the niche for a pirate game for 4 to 6 as Caribbean satifies my pirate needs for 2 to 3 players.

Too much luck involved in this.  Drawing cards and rolling dice make this game more frustrating than enjoyable to me.

I love this game to bits, and very excited about the expansion. It can go a little bit too long sometimes but everything about it is fun and lighthearted and the decision of which card to play can be REALLY tough. One of the most gorgeous games around. Only downside is that the rule book which is a bit impractical although kind of interesting.

RATING: 6
Cute racing game where you sail boats around an island through the playing of action cards. There are multiple routes, and the longer routes have better rewards in points than the shorter routes. It gets more challenging that each space has a cost associated with stopping there, so you need to manage your resources.

One issue is whenever you land on an opponent's space, you MUST fight them, which can get annoying if you land on someone who is much more combat prepared than you are. Overall a fun time-waster though. Not too thinky (sadly).

A fun light racing game that can't quite decide whether it wants to be luck based or skill based. The art is beautiful and the components are very well done. There are interesting decisions to make and plans to lay, but there are also elements that are very swingy like combat being resolved by a single unmitigated die roll. I don't mind luck-based games, but when there are a lot of thoughtful decisions in the rest of the game, the swingy luck elements annoy me. Still, it's a fun game overall and if you don't worry about winning and losing it works well.

Very light roll and move game. The game is a bit long for what it is.
Not a whole lot of decision making. The mechanic of having 2 actions following each other which the value is driven by the dice. You have to collect goods, get to the treasure chests first, save gold for scoring - pay what you collect as you move ahead - all add to the core race mechanic. A little bit of fighting and plunder adds to the priatey theme.

The art work makes the game.

First impression:
This is a light fun game for the whole family to enjoy. The material is super. The rule are well explained, easy to learn, and can be read in a couple of minutes. There is  a lot of luck involed, so for hard gamers this could be a turn off. You still have some management to do. So it's not all luck. The battles are fun and not too detrimental to the looser. Can't wait to play it again.
Update after a couple of plays, it's realy a good family game and will keep the rating has is.

Première impression:
Jamaica est une jeu léger, très plaisant pour toute la famille. Le matériel est superbe. Les règles sont bien expliquées, simples et faciles à lire un quelques minutes. Il y a beaucoup de chance impliquée ce qui peut déplaire aux joueurs expérimentés. Il y a tout de même une part de gestion dans ce jeu de sorte que ce n'est pas juste une partie de chance. Les batailles sont drôles et pas trop endicapentes pour le perdant. J'ai bien hâte d'y rejouer.
Après quelques parties, c'est vraiement un bon jeu famillial je ne changerai pas mon évaluation.

There's a lot more going on here than just a simple racing game.  It has dice, but since the die rolls are the modifiers for everyone, the playing field is level.  Though fighting is certainly random, you can usually stay out of conflicts if you plan well.  Fun, light, game.

I am really not sure about this one. Initially I thought this was a stunningly well produced pirate themed racing game. It has some outstanding properties and visuals. The box and the board are fantastically imaginative. Just what you would dream of in a perfect pirate game.The box insert is cleverly though out and the space is used exceptionally well. The components are very high quality.Everything is visually perfect. Nothing stands out of place with this game except for the movement mechanism. I do like it, but we have played this game maybe 4-5 times and I am just perplexed with the movement.I find that the movement is slow around the board,it's funny how it feels like a sailing ship. Slow and steady around the board. Collecting coins and treasures as you progress. But I can't seem to influence the speed at which the ship moves. Its purely down to the luck of the cards and how they are played. I would love to play this more but it leaves me feeling a little frustrated that I wasn't able to do anything to encourage the win. Maybe I don't understand the cards too .It would be nice if you had the ability to go after / seek out your opponents. With a bit more intent. The dice do a good job but something is just not right.

As much as I like hardcore theme and heavy strategy, this game never fails me. I have brought this to groups more than any of my other games. Everyone I have played it with has loved it. Take all your roll and move games like Sorry and Trouble and toss them out the window. This is an amazing racing game with resource management. It's just great light fun that offers great decisions for adults and can be played with 6 year olds. Phenomenal! *** Wife:6.5

This game appears to have a lot of potential.  Quality box design, detailed board, FABULOUSLY detailed and illustrated cards, sturdy cardboard components, and intricate ship pieces.  However, the game play, despite the apparent promise, it very disappointing.  It's not really a great race game and not really a great pirate game, either.

RATING: 7
This is a great game to play with my family (2 young boys and my wife).  The components look excellent, the theme (Pirates!) goes over very well with my sons, and it plays relatively quickly.  Is it lightweight? Yep.  Does luck play a factor? Absolutely.  Is it fun? Yes, it is.  If you are looking for a brain-burning strategy game then keep on looking, but if you are looking for a fun game to play with young gamers,non-gamers, or gamers wanting a lighter title - give this one a play.  Plus, you can talk like a pirate when you play it :D.

Update: ticked down a notch to 7.  Still really enjoy it as a family game, though.

Decent racing game.  The mechanism of two dice (morning and evening) along with the bonus cards keep it interesting.

In my experience, you need to stay near the front if you want a chance to win.  the 15 bonus (for crossing the line first) is too big a bonus to ignore.

RATING: 3
Totally hated it. Your turn will be 95% dictated by other players. When you gets a say during the other 5% it may or may not work out anyway 

leader rolls 2 dice, decides which dice corresponds to day/night and everyone plays event card. For example, leader rolled 4 & 6, decides 4 = day and 6 = night, you play 1 card (say day = move, night = gold). Then you'll move 4 during day and gain 6 gold during night. Problem? What if you need to move 3 or 5 to avoid getting beaten up by other people (move to same location = auto-combat)? 

Beautiful art, terrible game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
A racing game where actions are extremely swing-y.  Movement doesn't always go the way you plan, and combat can be won by rolling a specific side of the die no matter how set for combat your opponent is (which is nice when it works in your favor, but I dislike games that imply you can gear up for an action only to have your opponent completely negate it with a lucky roll).  This leads to frustration as nothing seems to go the way you plan, which is nice for catch-up mechanics.  However, making the race close at the expense of player agency isn't a solution I like.

RATING: 5
There is a strategy game hidden underneath this swashbuckling game. Dice rolling is central, but you have to use your event cards wisely. One major setback for this game is the undue harshness on certain players. If you are unlucky, you could easily be set back irremediably, as you have to move backwards until you can pay the costs. If you get attacked and stolen all your possessions, you could move back quite a bit.
Not my type of game. Too much left to chance. Although, I would compare with Sword & Skull on the plus side.

+ Stunning artwork, great quality components
+ If you are missing a "racing" game from your collection I would recommend this
+ Has conflict and player interaction but one can try dodge conflict too
+ Light and easy to learn but with a decent amount of strategy and planning too
+ Combats randomness introduced by dice rolls by having dice rolls affect all players
+ Family friendly
+ If you want a pirate game, I'd take this over Merchants & Marauders

- Sad to see so few copies in circulation. I would recommend it but not at the secondary market prices I've seen it going for

This is a blast when you're in the mood for combat dice fighting.  Components A+++.  The 2 player rules with the ghost ship is really fun. Not sure what the complaints are all about.  Sure, you do fight the ghost ship more than your opponent, but your opponent is the one who sends the ghost ship on you so it's really the same as fighting with your opponent.  Good fun!

Wonderful artwork, silly fun make this a nice game to play with a larger group of folks.  Kids can play as easily as adults which makes it a nice family game.  There is some "take that" in terms of combat, but so much happens that no one really feels picked on except perhaps the leader.  But then again, this game seems to go out of its way to make it hard on the leader and keep things on an even keel.  Probably not worth the expensive prices for the original version, but certainly affordable with the reprint.

--Sept2008-- Very very pretty.  The game is fairly harmless, yet looks like it might take a bit of practice to play cleanly.  My first outing was a 5p, which I expect is slightly above the sweet spot.  So it remains to be seen if the rating goes up after trying with fewer players.

My rating relates to it being what it is IMO.  A (younger) family game, and a great one at that.  Beautiful, smart, simple rules set, good length.  It's a top notch production but I wouldn't pull it out with too many all adult game nights, a little too light and luck filled for that.

I'll reserve a rating until I've had more playthroughs. I have played this once so far using the two player rules with my wife.

The theming and art for Jamaica is absolutely top notch. If you're looking for a game that oozes character and charm, this is it. Fantastic artwork, and high quality pieces and printing make this game shine.

After a first playthrough it's pretty clear that this game works best the more interaction between players there is. The more combat, the tighter the race, the more interesting and tense the experience. Unfortunately I felt the need to intentionally play sub-optimally to keep the first playthrough fun for both my wife and I. I attacked the Ghost Ship (a limited control AI player necessary for 2 player games) when it served no purpose, I chose to play cards that moved me forward more slowly because it was way too easy to get too far ahead with the right die rolls and card draw. My wife was sick the first time we played and I wanted her to enjoy the experience without feeling like I totally crushed her. I still had fun, but it was annoying to feel I had to hamper my own efforts to keep it fun for her.

Technically this game can be played with two people, but it's clearly better the more players you have. A wonderfully themed game that's fairly quick to play and easy to learn, but it has its issues.

OK race game with some neat mechanics.  The production values (especially the artwork) are top-notch; the game is merely average.  Then again, I'm not a particular fan of tit-for-tat games, especially ones where the ability to respond to attacks is often out of your control.
Also, whose daft idea was it to make the rules a single large sheet?  I know the game is simple enough that you probably won't need the rules again after even a few turns of the first game, but that's no excuse...

Beautiful game - I mean the artwork. Great fun game. Narrow set of choices each turn from your three cards, but that's great for playing with youngsters. Our game group have an avaerage age of 35 but seem to have a mental age of 8, so it goes down a treat!!

Good family game. Moving the ghost ship in the two player variant is a clever idea that means you don't get bogged down in just trying to battle against your opponent  constantly.

We wanted a competitive race game that had a direct fighting mechanic to it and this game fit perfectly. We really enjoy shooting cannons at each other, scrambling to steal the treasures first and playing the perfectly timed card to fly to the finish line. So much fun with kids, adults, gamers and non gamers. Easy to teach but enough strategy to engage us.

Jamaica -- Played twice; three- and four-player.

Neat mechanism.  Cards have different left and right indexes.  Active player rolls two dice and determines which die applies to which index, then the rest of the players choose which card to use, with the dice results applying to their cards left to right.

Very nice production values and component quality.  In fact, Jon particularly liked that the cover of the instruction booklet depicts only coins, so that when you open the box (which looks like a treasure chest), all you see are doubloons.  Thoughtful implementation.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
This game has a good buzz, so I was somewhat overwhelmed when I finally tried it. 

Firstly it's TTR category game (weight, target audience), but it's less accessible. Jamaica is a race game around the island, where you get some money for where you finish and every money and treasure grabbed along the way also counts. However the cards (two actions, one for morning one for evening) aren't the most intuitive.

And it drags. I have no idea what with the race games, but most of them are so slow. This one requires some residence management, some counting the board, some figuring our which card to take and all takes time. And all of these confuse kids with whom I'd play a game like this. 

There is combat where you can steal each other's treasure (or give them your cursed treasure) and that part is okay. It's just kinda random to arrange it. 

Too much overhead for what should be a light romp and it drags as a consequence. 

EDIT: eh. Down to 1.0. Just don't see validation for this game to exist. Too complicated and too slow for it wants to be, hence: half finished.

Really beautiful production (except for the ridiculous fold-out rule sheet) with high-quality components; I like this game and the mechanisms and overall it works quite well, but it's possible to feel like a turn is wasted if there are no good actions to take on the turn do the random of draw of cards.  This might be mitigated if players had the option to discard an unused card each turn and then draw back up as a way to possibly get something better to use.  This is especially important toward the end of the game when it's critical to move forward over the line to not loose points, but all you have in your hand are cards that provide resources.  This can be very frustrating.  Overall, this game is easy to teach and play and would probably appeal to casual gamers and families as well.

Gyönyörűen kivitelezett, praktikusan, jól kialakított dobozzal rendelkező könnyed, családi játék. A szabályai könnyen elmondhatók. Kalózhajónkkal minél hamarabb egy kört kell csinálnunk Jamaica körül, közben kincseket szerezni és másokat ügyesen kirabolni. Három kocka is van a játékban, mégis valahogy a 3 kártyából való választás és a több lehetőség nem érezteti a nagy szerencse szerepet.

A szerencse szerepével kapcsolatban inkább úgy fogalmazok, hogy abszolút elfér egy ilyen játékban. Igazából csak a csatában lehet kicsit zavaró.

The production values are high and the game is absolutely beautiful but I am starting to feel that racing games are just not for me. A good game to play with kids, as luck of the dice and cards plays a huge part and thus mitigates any advantages more experienced players would have over less experienced ones. On the other hand, the overt dependence on pure luck - what treasure card you draw, what three navigation cards you have in your hand and what you roll during attacking and defending - is what keeps the more serious gamers, who like to plan, build and strategise, from truly appreciating this game.

What a goofy game. You have retired pirates who are racing around an island, Jamaica, but the person who finishes first is not necessarily the winner as each pirate must add up gold and treasure cards. So the winner is not always the winner. However, it's goofy and fun and you get to fight. I have only played this with four and I don't think I'd play it with any less. The more conflict in this game the better and with three or less I don't think there would be much.

This is definitely the best pirate game I've played so far, as it is superior to both Pirate's Cove and Bounty.  You do get to make decisions based on the cards that you have, there are a couple of paths to follow, and the production values are excellent.  It is a bit high on the randomness side, but I think you need to approach it with the attitude of just enjoying the ride.

UPDATE:  The only downside to this, as to all the pirate games I've played, is that they seem to drag some and a bit long for what they are.  Lowering to a 5 as a result.

Jamaica is possibly the single most beautiful game I've played. The game itself would be good for families, but it's not for me. There's a ton of luck and not much control. There's luck in the various card draws and dice rolls, and the cards players use to program actions almost play themselves. It's just too light. If it weren't for the stunning production, I'd rate it lower and make a point not to play again.

RATING: 7
This is a racing game where players each play a pirate using the rolls of dice to collect resources and advance around an island.  It is really easy to teach, has some nice mechanics, and plays in about 30 minutes making it a fantastic filler.

Each player controls a pirate ship with 5 holds and a deck of cards, of which players have 3 in their hand at a time.  At the beginning of a round a player rolls two dice and assigns them to a "morning" and "evening" action.  Each card depicts two actions, one occurring during the morning and one during the evening phase.  These actions are either moving forward, backward, or collecting one of the 3 resources in the game.  The dice dictate how many spaces you move or resources you collect.  Most of the spaces cost gold or food to land on or you're pushed back and the third resource is gunpowder which is used in combat if you land on an opponent's ship during an action.

That's pretty much it.  The game ends when a player makes a full circuit of the map and players are awarded points based on their final position, number of gold, and certain treasures.  Some of the spaces around the board also contain treasures, it usually requires moving more spaces to collect the treasures but they can give end-game points or bonuses during the game.  Some are cursed as well, however, subtracting points at the end of the game.

This is clearly a roll-and-move game which by default garnishes boos from most gamers but this is a proper design with that mechanic.  Sure, you are moving due to the whim of a dice roll but there is a modicum of control and choice associated with that movement.  You have 3 cards to choose from and two ways to order the dice when it is your turn to roll.  There are still going to be rounds where all your options are sub-par but for this type of game that's okay.

I think this is a wonderful filler game.  That's all it is but it plays super quick, is easy to teach, and it looks really nice as well.  The components are all colorful and pretty and the insert holds everything is fitted spaces which is excellent.

RATING: 8
This is a race game on the surface, but there is a whole lot bubbling underneath that makes it a fun, dynamic, competitive strategy game. You need to manage several different aspects at once: resource management of food, gunpowder, and doubloons in your limited hull; movement to the optimal board spaces for your current situation; stockpiling enough resources to get by but not so many that you waste them; using up precious gunpowder attacking or defending; and much more. Race as your favorite plundering pirate to discover invaluable treasures, steal from your competitors, feed your crew, pay for port services, attack other ships, and curse your competition! 

Each round consists of that round's captain rolling two dice and selecting which to play for the morning action and which to play for the evening action. Then each player, starting with the captain, chooses which of their action cards to play to either move or collect a resource (food, doubloons, or gunpowder) based on the face-up number on each die. This is a very fun aspect of the game and necessitates some moderate planning ahead to see if any of your action cards have a movement to get you a treasure card or a particular resource that is running low in your hull.  

As you travel around the map, you must pay food to travel on the sea and doubloons to land at a port. You have to be careful, though, because if you move to a spot where you can't afford to pay, you must pay all you can of that resource then move back until you land on a space where you can pay everything...and then you have to pay that, too. See if you can use this to your advantage to land on treasure spaces at a very cheap cost!  

Another fun feature that I love about Jamaica is how a battle is forced every time two players land in the same spot. A star rolled on either side is an automatic win. Do you use six gunpowder tokens to really ramp up your attack so you can steal that player's treasure card or food tokens just to get blown away by a single star roll? Or should you play conservatively relying on the luck of the die? 

Overall, this is a very fun, pirate-themed game with incredible artwork and very high-quality pieces and boards. I give it a solid 8.

Nifty racing game.  Interesting card laying mechanic with a funny resource collecting twist.

A neat racing game idea ultimately diminished by the sheer volume of luck involved in the game. Multiple dice rolls, and two different types of card drawing mean almost everything is left up to chance.

I've tried to like this game both times I've played it. It's cute, colourful, and the components are top-notch for a great price! Also, this is the first game box I've ever seen where every component has its own place- no spillover or loose cards falling around. If I were rating it on components it would get a 10.

But the game is ridiculously luck-based, and apparently I get the worst hands imaginable, combined with truly teeth-clenching dice rolls. The second time I played it, my first 3 turns I had no movement cards, and then when I finally got movement cards (the forward/back cards, not the elusive forward/forward card) the dice continuously showed up as N and N+1, meaning that I could move a maximum of 1 space backwards or forwards in my current state.

Needless to say, I was saying "Yargh!" the whole game- and not in the fun Pirate-y way.

The game is gorgeous with simple rules.
I feel this game would be a hit with kids.
What kills it for me is the playing time which is too long in the best configuration (5-6 players).

RATING: 8
The visuals: this is what immediately jumps out at you about this game!  Every little bit of the game, from the box itself to the cards which can be placed end-to-end to form one long picture, has had a great deal of effort put into every minute detail.  I just love those visuals - this is cartoonish artwork done right (are you listening, "BattleLore"?)!  The only annoying thing about all that is the inconvenient "treasure map" style rules booklet.  And the icing on the cake is the fact that they have even put a great deal of thought into creating the best box insert that I have ever seen!  But enough gushing over the physical components - it's all well and good to have a pretty game, but is the game itself good?  And the answer is YES, as long as you don't mind something light, quick, and fun, that has fairly minimal strategic choices.  In fact, "Jamaica" is pretty much at the top of my list of gateway games now because it is very easy to learn, can be played in an hour, and is a fun, albeit light, experience even for a more experienced gamer such as myself.  The only thing that doesn't make much sense to me about game play is the fact that every player is supposed to do both their morning and evening actions before the next player plays.  We now play that all players take their morning action, then everyone takes their evening action.  And to get the most out of this game, you probably want to have at least 4-5 players.  But in a nutshell, this is a gorgeous, fun, light game.  Game design: 5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 8/10

Jamaica falls into that category of game that I think is fairly well designed and mostly does what it does well, but I'm simply not enthusiastic to play it.  It is chaotic and random but also clever and sometimes exciting.  I could see playing it with my kids.

[1 play] Initial Reaction Rating.  It was okay.  I had fun learning it.  It seemed like there was too much luck and not enough thinking for it to really be fun for me.  Like almost a game I would be more likely to play with my kids than my gaming buddies.  That said it worked well for a brand new game to try over lunch at work. I could see playing it again sometime, although I didn't get the sense it was a game I would want to replay over and over just due to the depth of strategy.

RATING: 6
[GameWorks SàRL 07 edition (1st printing) w/ Essen 08 promo cards] {Pirate, gateway; dice-rolling, resource management, fighting; optimal 4-6p} Jamaica is a wondrous family game.  It is thematic, fun and interactive.  It is not a strategic game and in most cases, your decisions are bound by the cards in hand and dice rolls.  In addition, the mechanic to resolve a battle is highly luck, though simple, due to the "explosion" (star).  It is a good gateway game - fun, fast, language-independent, dynamic, etc.  However, the game is a little bit too long with 5-6 players. 2p game is just boring. It is better to play this game with 4 players.  Besides, luck is very strong in this game (treasure card draw, dice rolls, etc.) and gamers may not really like this game.

Nonetheless, it is a tactical resource management game.  Players need to smartly maintain gold and food for their ships.  The racing aspect is also important - leading the race is a viable strategy.

The game is excellently produced: attractive, colorful and cute illustration, big dice, charming pirate ships, etc.  I particular like the cards can be assembled to form a story.

Gameplay hovers between a 6-7. Presentation is a solid 8. Jamaica is a light family game that doesn't offer alot of fresh ideas, but is fun nonetheless. I think you'll get the most out of it if you play it with as many players as possible.

The rules, printed on a big, folding map, are a real drag. Print out the player aid found on the Geek.

Great for its weight.  Enough decision making but just enough of luck to balance it out and make it feel even lighter.  Fits the elusive 6-player-but-doesn't-take-forever to play games.  Did feel just a bit artificially score balanced as no matter where you were during the game, everyone was super close in points at the end.  But that may just be because everyone eventually will wind up playing more or less the same cards.

Beatiful simple game with great artwork, just what i want in a boardgame, light fun and appealing. A big hit in my game group, the only downside that its combat is too dice roll dependant... I sometimes do a houserule to minimize the luck dependant with normal 1-6 dice with 6 is critical hit... this way the gunpowder will be more useful in combat and reduce random luck dice rolling to minimum.
Also a little rant about the rulebook... mine comes with multi language copies rule book, and I dont see it necessary... its just adds weight to the game, and I ended up spending a lot of money for the shipping cost to my country, If only those other 3 or 4 non english rule book doesnt included, it will be around 2KG weight and perfect for normal price shipping.
Despite that, this is my number one game for fun light game, thanks Jamaica for the fun hours spent with you.

One of the members of our game group brought this home from Switzerland and we had the opportunity to play the game.  It is certainly geared towards being able to be played with kids but even as 5 adults we had a great time playing it.  Luck does have a factor in this game - however for simple fun it is great.  Add to that the game is simply beautiful and it really is worth at least attempting to get a copy if I ever have a trade offer.

This is great fun, and a beautiful game. High quality components, easy game play, and a nice balance of luck and strategy. More players is definitely better, but it uses a ghost ship for 2 players, which works fine. The biggest negative for 2 is that catching up becomes unlikely, if you fall behind.

RATING: 6.5
This game is too chaotic for me. The combat die has a ridiculous spread, cannon are mostly useless, and most of the game is luck, either of the draw or die. If the combat die was removed and replaced with a traditional die so that cannon would be more effective, I might like it more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The art design in this game is BAR NONE the most stunning thing I have ever seen in a board game!!!  The action cards create a panorama longer than the table you are likely playing on.  The gold coins on the back of the rulebook make the box feel like opening a treasure chest.  All of the components fit perfectly into their own slots, with the treasure cards being 'hidden' under the player mats like...buried treasure.  The rulebook itself opens up into a treasure map.  The board is gorgeous and intricately decorated.  I have never seen this kind of cohesion in art design...in anything I've ever seen before.  

The game itself is a swashbuckling race against your fellow pirates around the island of Jamaica.  Gameplay is simple, but compelling due to the racing component and the battling you will do with your salty pirate rivals. 

Any lack of depth in the gameplay is made up for in the art direction and jokes made at the table with your fellow pirates.  Everyone should play this game at least once in my opinion.  It is a phenomenal experience.

RATING: 6
I had high hope for this game. Good theme and game play but it's not chaotic enough to make the game more exciting, the people I played this game with were disappointed at this game because they were expecting more 1 on 1 battling. I hope they would add 6 to 10 players expansion and I think the game is capable for that.

I added 2 points to more score to make it "Perfect."  It has been probably 2 years since last I played this gem of a game.  My wife and I re-read the rules and set sail.  What a superb game! Even with 2 players and a ghost ship it was great fun.  Beautiful production values.  Top-notch art.  It's worth trying to get if it sounds good.  When my daughter learn it, it will be an excellent family game.  The game is even fun to put away with it's tight compartments--but not ridiculously tedious compartments like Lords of Waterdeep.

You really feel the theme in this one and the mechanics are slightly random, but simple and allow several choices with little AP.

Thought I would love this game, but it's pretty much just roll and move. Way more than most games, I find it a blast when I'm winning but just want it to be over if you fall behind the leader by very much.  In fairness, I suspect the game would be more fun with more players (I've only played with 2).

This is a fun game that my wife enjoys.  I can see that too many games of it in a row would lead to monotony, but a game or two here and there and it will likely hold its fun.  There is lots of luck, though, with dice and card-draws.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Extremely light game that is overpriced and over length for what it is. Random card draw puts 3 cards in my hand and a random die roll by the start player determines what I can do. The start player is able to choose which order to put the two dice in and then I'm able to choose from my limited 3 cards which ones I want to do. Then if we all land on the same space we fight it out with die rolls. One of those is an instant win. In essence, you have very little control of what happens to you in the game. Which would be fine if it was cheaper and quicker.

A very simple race game that does give players some interesting decisions (mostly about which of three cards to play each turn) and works well in theme despite the wacky concept of a race between retired pirates. My biggest objection here is the huge swings in combat, With the numbers 2-4-6-8-10-*, with the star being an automatic win, the constant battles are are a luck-fest. I can see this appealing to many as a family-weight with some chaotic fun, but it didn't have enouh going on to keep me challenged or entertained.

RATING: 6.5
Played once with 5 players and once with 3 players. 5 or 6 is probably the sweet spot. originally designed to be given to Swiss insurance company clients. Since the game was really well received, the insurance company decided to release it to the general public (only in Europe currently). The game has some amazingly beautiful components and the board showing one main island and some smaller ones along the edge is very nicely done. The game play is pretty simple. A player rolls two dice and places one of them on the Day slot and the other on the Night slot. Then each player chooses a card from his hand of 3 cards to play. Each card has an action associated with Day and one with Night. The cards are then resolved in player order. A player may end up moving forward and/or backward some number of spaces, collect food, gun powder or doubloons. When a player moves, the space where he lands is resolved. If there is a food or doubloon payment there, a player must pay it or move backwards until he lands on a space that he can pay. If there is a treasure there, he draws a treasure card which will provide either doubloons, curses or special powers. If a player lands on a space occupied by another player, a battle ensues. In a battle, players may spend gunpowder to add to their attack roll. Whoever wins the battle steals the contents from one of the defeated pirate's 5 hold spaces. The game ends at the end of the round when one player makes it around the board. Doubloons and treasures are added to the bonus number on the space at which a pirate ends.

One of the best pirate games out there, though it's strictly a racing affair.

Played at Essen Spiel 2009. It looks beautiful, really, but after all it is just a (OK: not so simple) roll and move game. At least there are decisions to make, and there is fighting = player interaction, so many players will still enjoy it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I enjoy this game! Finding the balance between collecting resources & moving ahead is crucial! You may want to move ahead more but if you cannot pay for the space you are landing on, you will move back!

The battling is very entertaining! A 4+ game means you will be attacking each other a lot! The Treasures & resources will be trading holds frequently!

Overall, it's a very enjoyable game!

Roll and move plus random combat plus... excellent production values? It's like they knowingly tried to cover up this bad game with great art design.

The proof is that there are these oversized cards with great, colorful art on them, but only two small icons at the top have any gameplay purpose. I see how a game like this has the possibility to be fun, but it ultimately ends up being more frustrating than anything else. Don't be fooled by production.

The art design on the cards is amazing!  They can be arranged in a mural and each of the scenes ACTUALLY correspond to the items pictured in the top corners of the cards.  Everything about this game is awesome!

Except for the game.  Pretty with very little substance.  I give it points for the slightly strategic mechanic that every player has the same options for progression each turn. But, fighting sucks, moving is almost random with 6 players, and generally, I don't think it engages players.

I've had good fun with my family with this game. My nieces and nephews that are on the younger spectrum are challenged by the decisions with the cards and the dice. The battle system is super easy to grasp, and it isn't too brutal. So the little ones don't run off crying when they're attacked. Highly recommended as a game with a pirate theme, and as a lightweight family-friendly game.

First of all, fantastic production.  Beautiful from the components to to the insert.

This is just the kind of game that I can easily get to the table as it is fun for both kids and adults, easy to teach, looks great, has a theme with broad appeal, scales well from 3-6 players and plays within an hour. 

Basically it is the perfect family game.

Update: Rating goes from a 7.5 to an 8. I find every play to be fun and the game plays out differently all of the time. Some games people are more bunched up due to cards, dice rolls, strategy, whatever. Those games have a lot of combat and fortunes are swinging wildly. Other games are spread out and the racing takes precedence. And some times there are some racers and some fighters. 

However it plays out, it is rarely clear who the winner will be. As I said, great fun!

This one has moved right up there with Around the World in 80 Days for favorite family boardgame.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 4
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1

This game plays relatively fast and is easy to learn. Most pirate games are far too heavy on the campy, cartoony theme which makes this one stand out by comparison. At its heart, this is a racing game. You pick up treasure and have the occasional battle (with very simple mechanics) and your movement is card & resource driven. I think the game is very well put together and love to pull it out when I have a group in the mood for something light and engaging while still having a "euro" feel.

This is a good-old fashioned wild ride.  It's quick, it's not deep, and it's lightly strategic.  It might not be a deep game about piracy, but it captures all the fun of blasting your friends and family with as much gunpowder as you can muster just to nab a couple gold.  Definitely sits in the "more fun to play than to win" category, but unlike, say, Apples to Apples you can actually try to win.

RATING: 7
A good, quick, fun game. Dead simple and can happily blast out a few games in a row. Downside is games often feel like they end too quickly before you had much of a chance to get things going. Looking forward to playing 6 player which I imagine is highly entertaining chaos.

Pirate racing game. Great artwork. I suggest having all the day time actions and consequences go off and then handle the night time actions and consequences. Teaching it this way from the outset makes for an easier learning game. Battles can happen only after the night phase for a faster game, or have them happen after the morning phase too for a more cutthroat, but longer game.

Really enjoy this game! Iove the clever mechanics when "programming" your ship by placing the dice in the order you want and using one of the cards you have in your hand. All players are doing this in secret which can have some really fun and unsuspected results, really fun! Also this game just looks amazing! The components and artwork is sublime. But i really have to mention the insert, this is the best and most clever insert i have ever seen in a board game, every single component has a well designed place in the insert, its almost like a little game placing everything back in the box again :)

Fun little race game with some twists. The game is quite swingy and HEAVILY luck dependent. But it was still fun, which is the most important. The rolling of the day and night dice don't really make it possible to have any long term strategy, so you kind of have to just react to what the game gives you. The treasures add a nice little wrinkle, and as a short, little game: not bad.

Great racing game that actually does roll and move well. Fun and light, which means I can use it as a gateway game, but it's still fun enough to pull out even with an experienced crowd. The game looks amazing. The box inserts is easily one of the best box inserts ever, everything fits perfectly. 

The only downsides are that the game has two huge luck elements (dice roll & card draw) and the rulebook is an unwieldy foldable-map. The idea is thematic, but it's a real pain to look up a rule (not that you really need to)

I really enjoyed this game.  It is effectively a race around an island, more of a Pirate-themed game than one might expect from the title.  The mechanics were simple to pick up on, but they fostered a lot of competition and some laughs.

I would definitely play this again given the opportunity.  It seems like it could be good with kids, although they might have a hard time with some of the stockpiling strategies involved.

This game is funny.  I am a slightly older guy and I really like this game.  It is a fun, racing game.  Artwork is great, it's fast and easy to learn.  Great family game.  Get to the finish line first with as much gold as you can and you win.  Land on another pirate to steal from them.  Obtain treasures as you go.  Very simple easy going game.  However, not all I have played with enjoy it as much as me.

Nice box!!! It's full of theme and works very well, plus it's gorgeous to look at. The rules fit the theme very nicely.  A pirate ship race around Jamaica!  Three cards and dice rolls throw in a lot of randomness, but some strategy prevails, like which cards to hold on to for certain stretches. One of my favorite things about a game is when the bits fit the box so gloriously!

For a simple racing game commissioned by an insurance company, this game packs a lot of fun and replayability into a very beautifully designed box (seriously - i never seen such a nice insert tray!). The rules are pretty simple and even plays well in 2-p where you use a neatly themed 'black ghost ship' to introduce more mayhem into the already cutthroat equation. Great game, well themed and highly repayable. Good entry game as well as good strategy for seasoned players.

You may not have heard of Jamaica, but I encourage everyone to give it a try. It's a terrific game - one of the best of the year - and is a fantastic family game that kids will be able to play along with their parents. But even with a group of adults, this is a solid game that is mostly a race but with the addition of simple fighting and some resource collecting. Certainly there's a good amount of luck in cards drawn and dice rolled, but the game is fun enough that it will stay in my collection and travel to most events I run. I can teach the game and walk away, satisfied in the knowledge that everyone playing is going to have fun.  See my review for more details...

Good game for 4, 5 or 6 players (might be a bit boring with less). Quite random, but that's OK considering its length (it plays in about an hour with four players). Moreover, the theme is so fitting that I don't mind. Inviting looks, very little downtime between turns and low complexity mean that it's perfect for casual gamers. And another plus: The winner is not determined until the very last round(s). I would bring this game to a party any time!

RATING: 6
I would characterize Jamaica as a very light race-around-the-board pirate dice game. Because there are a finite number of spots on the track, this game plays quickly and well under an hour even with five. There are some shades of similarity between this game and Pirate's Cove apart from the theme. I personally like this game better than Pirate's Cove which has a significant rich-get-richer problem and that the first player to lose several battles have a tough time coming back to win. The dice mechanic is cute but not sure if it contributes that much to the game in terms of mechanic. The sea battles are streamlined and even though I appreciate the rapid battles, they are very luck-driven. Early gains in cargo holds don't mean much but later cargo holds have to be mainly doubloons. Overall an ok game which deserves occasional play.

RATING: 5.7
You try to be the first to reach the finish line but at the same time you try to collect points and treasures while racing for the win.
Everyone has three cards in his hands and every card shows two values (move, fight etc.). You have to use both values on the card you play.
There is an interesting mechanism where the starting player rolls dice and can decide which die to put on the day phase (first value to use) and night phase (second value).
According to these values, the players plan their turn and which card to choose and which action to use when.
Despite this interesting mechanism (I've never seen it in any other game so far) it was just not my game, I think it could be very cool but somehow I didn't enjoy it very much.

Pretty good game, maybe a bit over-hyped from the Dice Tower guys. I regret overpaying to get it when it was out of print, but I do think it's a solid game to have in your collection.  It's nice to have some games that you can set up and teach in 10 minutes.

Definitely too luck based though, the game is all about having the right cards when the right dice are rolled.  Score is too swingy.  Almost always one person shoots past everyone and just scores the mega points at the finish line while every one else is in the negative range.  That's really my biggest complaint, a racing game that doesn't feel like a race.

Probably too light and fluffy for regular appearances at your game group, but a great game for the family.  There's many games that have tried for the pirate theme, and this is the first light game that has succeeded.  If you're a pirate fan, you can get by with this game for the lighter evenings, and [gameid=25292] for the heavy side.  

Jamaica's mechanics are dead simple, and decisions are straightforward without being strategically obvious.  There's a bit of take-that gameplay, but it's light enough and not crushing enough so that it can be recovered from rather easily.  

Finally, the artwork on the cards is absolutely gorgeous, as every card in a player's deck is uniquely illustrated in a luscious style.  They are perfectly executed, and it's pleasant getting lost in the art whenever you find yourself with some downtime.  It's the best execution of lighthearted cartoon art in a boardgame that I know of.  Really a triumph.

RATING: 5
The game has a neat flow, and the mechanisms all work in relation to each other.  I like the way the cards, the dice, and the day/night rules coincide, but the randomness of the cards mixed with the randomness of the dice can create some frustrating moments, especially when you have no cargo in your hulls.  Still, the production of the game gives it a lot of OOMPH, and the game is short enough that it doesn't overstay its welcome.  If you're looking for a real pirate-y game, though, you might want to look elsewhere, since the theme is pretty much just for show.

A very wellproduced pirate game.  The artwork is really fabulous, the theme is so inviting, as if you entering happy-pirate-land. The game itself, basically a lightweight roll and move with some extra choices, do i use my 5 to move or to take some gun powder or to move 5 spaces?  A nice feature is the ability to attack each other when 2 players occupy the same spot.Love it :-)

Instead, he invites all of his former "colleagues" and comrades-in-arms to join him in his retirement, so they can enjoy the fruits of their looting in all impunity.

Each year, in remembrance of the "good old days", Morgan organizes the Great Challenge, a race around the island, and at its end the Captain with the most gold in his holds is declared Grand Winner.

Family game. Program your racing moves based on the dice rolled and the cards in your hand. First to finish does not necessarily win.

RATING: 7
The rules felt a bit ambiguous on a few points (necessity of taking treasure card if lose a battle, whether battles need to be fought when moving back due to shortages if ships are just along your pathway and not just on the final ending spot), but it was still fun once we came up with an interpretation.  More players seems to make for more fun because battles are more likely to take place.  Also, the game is just plain lovely!

Very pretty artwork and components as well.

RATING: 6
This is a family friendly roll and move game. In other words, kryptonite to most hobby gamers. It seems like it is going to be underwhelming as expected all of the way through the rules explanation, but then you start playing, and happily the game delivers a much more interesting experience. Most of this is due to the contrived rules about storing and using cargo on your ship, as the game forces you to work out clever moves to minimize the loss of resources. The action selection/hand management mechanics also combo nicely with the cargo rules to give you a bit more to think about from turn to turn than you might expect.

All that being said, it is still very much a simple to teach family game. Even the newest recruit will be able to pick up the rules after one run around the table. It's also effectively a race game, which makes it super easy for a new player to understand 'how to win', which is often times the hardest thing to communicate when explaining a new game.

If you're looking for a great gateway game, give this one a try!

This game is AWESOME!  I enjoy that they took a mechanic that has been around forever and just made it better.  I enjoy that this game is a roll and move, but its completely different.  Trying to race for the treasure and trying to be the first to reach that space is awesome, and I love the battle system in the game it just adds so much to the game.  Get ready in a 6 player game though, battling is going to be every turn!

This game ranks high for me on many levels.  First, it's Pirate themed (fortunately one of the better Pirate games out there), the components are beautiful as is the board, it's a racing game that accommodates 6 players, there's more than just racing going on giving you a choice of strategies (or maybe which basket to put your eggs in), and it's not a brain burner having just the right amount of luck to keep things edgy.

It looks gorgeous, but it's random as hell. I played it with a group of friends so we had a great time anyway, but the gameplay isn't all that interesting. I guess my positive experience with Jamaica depended on the circumstances and the people around me, not on the game itself. Still, if you want a simple family game with beautiful components and strong theme give this one a try.

This game seems to be the perfect fit for couples' game night.  It is light enough that we can all have a good time, yet strategic enough that it isn't a mindless activity.  Not to mention pirates, so accents and lame jokes are a plenty.  (What's a pirate's favorite letter?... Nope, you would think that, but it is actually the C.)  There is some fun back-and-forth, get even with one another moments.  The art work is also really nice.  I guess I wouldn't be doing my duty if I didn't comment on the moderately annoying rules document.  It unfolds like a treasure map.   While cute, it is not quite functional.

This is a great little roll-and-move race game with a few twists: you're rolling dice for the whole table, then using cards that have two symbols and lining those up with the dice, so the order of the dice matters. There's also a bit of combat if you ever land on the same space as another player. Beyond that, it's a simple game of trying to get back to the starting line as soon as possible and being able to pay the tolls along the way.

It's a beautiful game with fantastic art and a friendly pirate theme, one that I'll keep around for a quick game or for new gamers.

Brought this to game night. The guys liked it a lot. This game is a lot of luck. But using your cards to move or supply your ships can help the luck factor. The art work is awesome. Big wooden dice. Production is high quality. The box insert holds everything perfectly. The only down side is the instructions. They are a fold out. Hard to read them when unfolded. Should have been a book format. Other than that it's a fun family race game.

HARRRR!!!! piraterij was nog nooit zo simpel.

Spelers zijn piraten die rond het eiland jamaica varen in een wedstrijd. Echter als ze elkaar tegenkomen zullen ze er alles aan doen om de tegestanders uit te schakelen in een vuurgevecht. Daarnaast zijn er ook nog verschillende schatten te vinden rond het eiland, maar kijk uit dat ze niet vervloekt zijn.

Iedere ronde rolt één speler twee dobbelstenen en aan de hand van die dobbelstenen speelt iedere speler een actiekaart uit met twee acties erop. Deze acties kunnen zijn: verplaatsen, kanonskogels aanschaffen, voedsel en geld inslaan. Aan het eind wint de speler met de meeste punten, die kan men krijgen door geld, schatten en de eindpositie in de race.

This is a pretty game and a lot of fun. There is not much deep strategy but you do get to choose from three cards each round. Sometimes those choices may not be good ones but you have to do something. I like that the cards have 2 actions and that the morning one must be completed before you start the evening one. Sometimes they work together and sometimes not. Give this one a try.

Pretty pirate-themed racing game that offers some opportunities for clever play and tangling with other players, but the randomness of the movement card selection prevents this from being anything more than a light, breezy game.

My wife was very excited in reading the rules and looking at the gorgeous bits.  However, at the end of of the race she felt that it was a little flat.  I don't know if that is the game or if it is because we only played with two.  I would like to play with more to see how it plays out.  Plus she was a little miffed she couldn't remember that "green means go (forward)!"

After another play (with three), this does seem to be lacking.

RATING: 6
A very well designed and smart game for the family to be sure.  The simple roll-and-move concept was further improved upon by the clever designation between a day and night choice for all players.  The decision was then expanded by the cards in your hand.  There was a smidgen of the RoboRally-esque sense of chaos in that what happened each round (in terms of where you move to) may not always be what you have planned.  The backward penalty for not having enough resources to pay was interesting but also easily abused.  Sure there was a huge amount of luck involved, but some of it was controllable.

Like I said, Jamaica is a fine game for the right audiences but alas I'm not really one of them.  So while I don't mind playing it occasionally, it is definitely not a must have title for me.

WOW! What a fantastic components are in this game. The ships, the artwork on the cards (notice that when you place them one behind another in the right order, there is a big painting), the components (which fit perfectly into the boxinsert), the rules which looks like a treasure map (which made them not easier to read, but it’s great addition to the theme of the game). Everything just looks like this is a game for adults to play with kids. After playing this one, we only can agree. Easy to explain. Fun to play. Fantastic theme. What could a parent want more to introduce their kids into boardgaming? Or if you have no kids, just use it to introduce it to other non-boardgamers.

I think the components are top-notch and very attractive, durable, and thematic.  I couldn't be happier with the production quality of this game!

The gameplay is somewhat lacking.  Don't get me wrong, I find the game to be fun, but not as exciting as many reviews stated.  

If you are looking for a lighter game with a pirate theme, this is an excellent choice.  BUT if you are looking for a more tactacle experience, this falls flat.

Families will love this one though and I can see it being a staple in many board game collections.

Lush graphics, some interesting mechanisms, such as another novel application of dice, presumably from Sébastien Pauchon.  This is sort of a give-and-take family game with some fascinating strategic elements.  On the whole, however, it doesn't do much for me, although it does provide a very unusual experience.

Good gateway, good theme, good for the family, great art, and by far the absolutely best designed box insert ever for a game. All producers should take note.

Originally rated this 6.9, however upgraded because how much this is requested and played, and how much fun we have playing it.  What it lacks in strategy, it MORE than makes up for in fun and production quality, all around awesome game!

One of the best to play with new people, especially with 4-5 players. It packs all the familiar things people know/like (roll-n-move, attack, treasures) into an accessible game. Brilliant.

Cute filler with a little bit of strategy.  Plays up to six, although the game would probably drag a bit with that many.  Definitely worth adding to your collection if you like light games with great components and art.  Fun.

Whenever I want to play a game with some folks who want to play but not play anything too complicated I get this. Everyone loves it. So simple to play and just because you cross the finish line first, that doesn't mean you'll win. That always surprises people the first time. And it makes them take notice that modern games are quite different than what they're used to.

After 1 Play: It's really pretty, but I don't see much game here.  The randomness is overwhelming, despite the evenness that the mechanics try to trick you into seeing.

RATING: 8.5
A game done right! Great theme, great artwork, simple rules, only symbols - no reading required (on the cards or anywhere else), interesting choices to make on every turn, right amount of luck for the gamelength (just go for a "Revanche" if your cannons fly low - or go for a best out of 3 from the start). Interesting risk-reward mechanism (especially for the later players, since it can happen that the required resource for your plan is taken from you).

Don´t play with whiners or hotheads - other than that: simply great fun!

Only reasons to not award 10 Points: I can sometimes be frustrating/anticlimactic if the leading player(s) make it way beond the other players. Rules as a folding-map might be a thematic idea - but is simply a pain.

Игра-гонка, со значительным влиянием случайности (кубики, приход карт). Минусом является значительное время ожидания во время фазы выбора действий. Плюсом - офигенное оформление игры. Для детей в самый раз.

A family game of lighthearted pirating that is breezy, fun to play, and interactive. The artwork and components are some of the best I've ever seen in a board game. 

Own the mini expansion.

Compite en una carrera alrededor de la isla en la cual no solo hay que llegar primero sino también recolectar tesoros y abastecerse con comida y municiones. En cada ronda los jugadores escogen una de sus cartas a la vez y luego ejecutan la acción del día y la noche.

Easy game to pickup, and a racing game of ships(!) to boot. Beautiful production as well.. very proud owner of the game.

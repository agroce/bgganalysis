I enjoyed Skull for quite some time, but with experienced players it ends up generating a bit of a Nash equilibrium of the same old play patterns. Still a nice tactile way to burn 10-15 minutes now and then, but there's other fillers I'd rather play.

I suspect I prefer Kakerlaken Poker to this...mainly due to the fiddly rules explanation.

130929 Still a great bluffing game.  Its been a regular in my game bag.  I don't think other people love it as much as I do, but it does get played a bit.

120909 Tight bluffing game.  It took the math out of Liar's Dice and made it pure.  Lovely game.  I use a Gostop deck and its perfect for this game.

Skull is the lightest of the light, a bluffing game boiled down to its very core mechanics. I'm a huge fan of this one but my group was lukewarm on it so I had to get rid of it eventually. I still might PNP a basic version of this as I found the simplicity of the challenge very appealing. Highly recommended!

RATING: 5
At first on could think that this game is only about making blind guesses (which in my opinion would be simply boring). After a couple of rounds you find out that there is actually some decision making as well:

1) Playing a skull effectively prevents you from making a guess and winning the game. On the other hand, a skull also has a possibility to prevent others from winning.
2) During bidding, you have to be very careful about giving out too much information. You do not want to tell others that you've just played a skull by passing too early. At the same time you risk winning the bid and having to reveal your own skull.

Sometimes, however, there are situations in which the decision is too easy. You either let some other player to have a shot at winning or you take it yourself by pushing your luck further than anyone else.

The bottom line is that, Skull works the best for ad hoc improvised playing when you have nothing but coasters to play with. I'd never ever pay for owning a copy.

RATING: 10
This is probably one of my favorite game and one of the only I rated 10. Just be careful it does not work with everyone and particularly not for beginners/casual players who may not understand the fun in bluff/counter bluff/counter counter bluff/...
The highlights really come when you have good player around the table and where every play become very tactical. The rules are very simple so you can concentrate on your tactic and observe other players.
Again, does not work with everyone but when it does...it's a blast

RATING: 6
Light filler, a fun bluffing "Liar's Dice" element.  I like it, except that I don't like that you must pass if you played a skull.  Having the option to NOT turn over my own skull would keep me in the challenge phase. 

That said, it plays fast and it didn't end up being a problem like I thought, so maybe with more plays it would be ok.  Still, hard to rate it higher than a 6 because of the narrow situations I'd get it to the table.

RATING: N/A
Bluffing and drama distilled. More so than most games, it has the ability to create palpable suspense followed by cries of triumph and despair from everyone who plays it- and I mean everyone, because this is one of the best games to introduce to non-gamers.

Sidenote: one of the few games I don't mind getting beat up and stuff spilled on. It has that feeling, of something that should be worn and have stories to tell. Also, I have Red edition, and while the art on the cards is really nice, i do think a black box is more enticing, and the Black edition cards look better in person than they do in photos- really have a biker feel. Skull is nice as well, though harder to tell when someone has their mat rose side up.

About as simple as a bluffing game can get - esentially a twist on the Liars Dice mechanic but with beermats. The only components are the beermats, but the art is very nice. Can be taught in seconds, but with the right crowd can be hillarious. 

We have both the Red and Black sets which can supposedly be combined for up to 12 players, but realistically I think 7 or 8 is the most that should be played at once.

Great as a drinking game.

Excellent bluffing game that is like liars dice.  It fixes the one issue I have with liars dice in that you never really get into a situation without options (not in a situation of do a bid that wont make or die.  One downside is that there is a "someone needs to take one for the team to stop someone winning mechanic" but its fairly mild.  Liars dice has more layers and levels but this is still a great pick.

Another simple to teach bluffing game that has some staying power. I like these kinds of games because after I teach them to someone who isn't a "gamer", you can see they're confused at first, but eventually they get it. In Skull, each player first antes a coaster (4 coasters with a rose, 1 with a skull), then the first player either antes another or starts bidding. They are bidding on how many coasters they can turn over w/o finding a skull. Other players can raise the bid or pass. Win 2 flips and you win the game. Recommended to anyone who plays games with traditional non-gamer types.

I have no idea what Shut Up & Sit Down sees in this game. Skull seems too unintuitive for the experience it is attempting to generate.

Cockroach Poker distills a bluffing experience into its most basic and accessible form. Every play in the game is bluffing or not and trying to read the potential bluff.

It just does the 'pure bluffing game' so much better than Skull that I see no reason to play Skull over Cockroach poker :/

I used to like this more but I think I would usually rather play liars dice. Still a very fun bluffing game, love that it really feels like a stab when you flip a skull, but overall id rather play more thematic card games or more raucus bar games.

Apri 2011: This one has me a little conflicted. On one hand I really like the bluffing element, where you're trying to guess who has a rose on top and who doesn't (using their bids as some sort of guidance).

On the other hand, the pacing seems a little off -- as in, quite often people only played one card before the guesses began. It felt a little like we weren't playing how the game was intended. The rules explanation up front also had me way confused for some reason. The whole game just doesn't seem to be that intuitive.

Still, it's short enough that it doesn't really matter, and it makes a fun filler. Initial rating a 6.

Pretty much perfect for what it is, and I like what it is a lot.  Bluff and double bluff pulled off pretty much to perfection - and done quickly and entertainingly enough to not outstay its welcome.  Indeed it plays so quickly and so well that you'll always want another game or two - great stuff.  Play with tongue in cheek and fingers crossed!  Updated another notch after yet more plays.

Barely even a game, but it does qualify as a game I guess.  An extremely simple bluffing game.

Each player has 4 coasters, three are roses and one is a skull.  At the start of each round, each player puts a coaster of their choice face down in front of them.  Then, players take turns either playing another coaster, or making a bid.  If you make a bid, you're declaring how many coasters you can flip up, including your own, without revealing a skull.  Bidding goes around the table until no one wants to increase the bid.

If you flip over coasters equal to your bid, you get a point.  Two points wins.  If you fail, you lose one of your coasters at random.  Run out of coasters and you're out of the game.

That's all there is here.  A pure game of bluff boiled down to about as simple as it gets.  I'd never choose this over a game like Liar's Dice, but I suppose I could get drug into a game of Skulls & Roses since it's mercifully over in 5-10 minutes.

All bluff, no fluff! There's some real tension here - if choosing which tiles to flip doesn't fill you with anxiety then you're doing it wrong. It's like playing a game of Liar's Dice where you get to choose the side of your die.

Also, I feel like I should always be allowed to go first in this game because I have a skull+flower tattoo.

This game feels a bit like one of the classic “beer & pretzels” bluffing game as you need to take an educated guess on how many coasters you can flip over without revealing a skull. Eeach player has 3 roses and 1 skull, and each round they put one face down until somebody claims they can flip over X number of coasters, and the next player can then overbid until there is one person left. As you need to turn your own coasters over first, you don’t want to put any skulls if you do win the bid, but it is certainly valid to sit back and act like you’re thinking hard, then make a bid, and then hope that another player overbids you, which he probably will as he “knows” that at least your coasters are all roses as you made a bid… 

So, while some claim that this game is pure luck, I don’t think that does the game justice. I think it’s more about bluffing, reading other players’ body languages and taking calculated risks. 

Considering how much people laughed, my rating is probably a little low, but that is because I don’t think that there’s much to the game, and there are other shorter games I would rather play. Also, I didn’t like that the winner honestly feels a little random, and that, when you lose a round because you couldn’t find the number of roses you claimed, you discard a coaster randomly – and if it is your skull, you’re going to have a hard time bluffing and manipulating the game going forward.

I wasn't impressed with this filler game. It's probably best as a drinking game to fill the time because there's not much to it, other than bluffing. It almost felt like more of an activity than a game, there wasn't enough decision making. The good news is it doesn't take too long to play.

Surprisingly enjoyable bluffing game in the vein of Liar's Dice. Every player has four disks - three flowers and a skull. Everyone 'antes' one of them face down. Then the start player places another or 'bids'. A bid indicates that he thinks he can turn over that number of flowers, without turning a skull. If he fails, he loses a disk at random. If he succeeds, he is half way to victory. The game rewards aggressive bidding. Bluffing seems unrewarding until you've managed to whittle away the other players' hands - and you can figure out what they've got. It is quite clever and charming. It certainly fits in the micro-game realm. In fact, you could DIY a copy with stickers on poker chips. But then you'd be missing some very beautiful art.

I do not buy Asmodee games.

I dislike free market manipulators, especially when they offer lower prices to LGS at the same time charging higher prices to cherry picked a very few high volume outfits like CSI. LGS hardly discount unless like online shops CSI or MM they also have a store front. There are very few of this stores. 

All this does is create high prices and makes it very hard for any new startup online shops or established ones that are below CSI in the eyes of publisher Asmodee to compete, stay in business. This will eventually drive up online prices across the board because of lack of true competion.

Came across this one randomly while looking for a Halloween-themed game.  Even though this game is really a biker guns-and-roses themed game, it has a Dia De Los Muertos feel.

We played with 4 players and had a great time.  It is a bluffing game that has a lot of layers to it.

Pure bluffing games are really not my thing (too stressful) but I can recognize that's what Skull does and it does it well. Feels like there is more decision-making than Liar's Dice. It's not just a "do I bluff or not" type game--there is some "long-term" strategy in trying to get your opponents to think a certain way about you behavior and then surprise them! Like Coup, but without as much player elimination.

SKULL edition from Asmodee.  

Players take turns either playing one of their four coasters, which are skulls or flowers, or issuing a challenge.  A challenge is a bit on how many coasters they can flip without revealing a skull - and they must reveal their own coasters first.

Brilliant little game of bluff and reading that you can teach in 60 seconds.  There are a few layers to this one that requires a few plays to reveal themselves and appreciate.

I have had a blast with this game! It's a relatively simple bluffing game, but the tension/excitement of deciding whose cards to flip over (as you look them dead in the eye hoping for the slightest tell) is so much FUN! I just use a deck of cards to play this. It works fine.

First play with 5. Much more interesting than I expected! It has player elimination, yes, but only after you've lost 4 times. In this case the threat of being eliminated provides needed weight to the challenge of revealing a higher number of roses. Each time a skull was flipped, it generated a lot of exclamation at the table. The feelings of bluffing and getting away with it and of detecting whether others were bluffing weren't as strong as I'd imagined, but may become stronger with future play.

Quite a clever bluffing game. I went way too aggressively and was first eliminated but it was still interesting to watch the rest play out. Not sure how many games I could play in a row but it's a good game in this genre. 

You have four coasters (yeah, like drink coasters); one side has images. Three have roses and one has a skull. Each turn you play a coaster face down in front of you OR you begin the bidding process at which point all coaster placement stops. So at this point, there may be, for example, seven coasters down on the table among five people. If you don't want to play a coaster, you have to bid how many of these coasters you can turn over without revealing a skull. You must turn over ALL of your coasters first, so better not be a skull there or you better be bluffing and hope someone bids higher than you.

This one all depends on the group for me. I've played it and been a bit meh as it can all seem a bit random. With other groups, I've had a great time with audacious betting and players really trying to get into each others heads

Still, it's a great game to have. Anyone and everyone can pick it up easily, the rules explanation takes about 30 seconds, you can play it in the pub, you can play it after quite a few drinks. It definitely fills a hole in my game collection.

This is pretty much Liar's Dice without the dice, meaning it has even simpler components, even simpler rules, and conveys pretty much the same feeling.

RATING: 9
This is easily the best bluffing game I've ever played. There is no luck component, only reading your opponents. I think it takes a game or two for most people to figure out how to play.

It's great with 4 or more players and becomes a very different game once it dwindles down to 2(if it gets to that point).

Arguably the lack of luck could make this game less replayable among the same group of people over a long enough period of time, but so far each game has felt exciting and tense.

I’m not much for Liar’s Dice, but I enjoy Pow Wow. It’s another game in that vein where you are trying to guess what other people have and ‘hope’. Overall it’s not that interesting of a game if you were to approach it in terms of a game, but I have to admit it does induce a lot of fun, so as a social experience, it’s the bees knees.

Wow!  A fantastic "ultra-light" or filler / party game, that actually has a lot of bluffing depth.  For me, this will replace liar's dice, as it doesn't have a pain in the ass scoring system to deal with.  It also plays three up to infinity (just buy more sets) with no problems at all.

COLLECTION: I own a homemade version of this game using wooden discs in place of the coasters. It has enough pieces for a 7-player game. 

This is a bluffing game in the vein of [thing=45]Pirate's Dice/Liar's Dice/Bluff/Perudo[/thing]. Each player has 3 roses and 1 skull. Every round, each player puts one card face down, more cards may go on top of those, and eventually bidding begins. Bluffing is critical here, but there is really no probability calculation to do as there is in Liar's Dice. Depending on your preferences, that can be good or bad, but the feel of the game is very similar. 

Another interesting aspect this game has that other similar games do not seem to provide is an element of groupthink. After a few games, or even rounds, it is easy to slip into "you should always start with a skull" or some other type of "right way to play". But of course, the only "right" way to play is to do what no one else expects. The look on someone's face when they turn over a skull you have placed down unexpectedly is priceless. Works well with various numbers of players, bigger groups will take longer though.

Fantastic in it's simplicity.. reminds me of Kakerlakenpoker. But has a different feel.

The rules on loosing a card randomly are a bit unfair if you should keep your skull as the last card, for then it is impossible to win.. so i would change that to: if you're down to two cards and have a skull left, you'll automatically lose the skull.

(05/09/2014) Comment based on 2 plays in one sitting.

This is a simple, quick, but intense bluffing and push-your-luck game.

The game could easily be played with elements of a 52-card deck, but the components and artwork make this a pleasure to play.

Because of the bluffing element, it seems to play best with six players. With fewer players, it may not provide enough tension. It's a solid "7".

Arguably the quintessential bluffing game with a nice push your luck element involved in the bidding. Each turn is tense and hilarious. not to mention, it's SO SIMPLE. Are there better games that involve a bluffing element? Yes. Are there better simple bluffing games? Nope.

A light, filler game good for the start of a games night as we wait for people to arrive, or at the end as people start to leave.

Like: The opportunities for bluffing are the main part of the game, and make for the enjoyable part of it. The ability to control the game through starting bidding is interesting, but only to a limited degree.

Dislike: It's lightweight to the point of being casual. The player starting the bidding controlling the next round (and so being the first potential bidder) feels like a bit of a problem as it limits the scope of bids when it inevitably happens after a single lap of the table.

Skull, for me, always has a lot of potential, but only capitalizes on that potential occasionally. It can either be tense and funny and entertaining, or it can be slow and monotone. Really, it just needs a group of engaged people who are willing to laugh.

RATING: 9
I tend to like bluffing games, and boy is this a great one. I think that "Liar's Dice without the dice" describes only half the gameplay -- there's also a big element of "surely you could not have put the poison in the cup in front of you . . . " Boy do I wish this had existed when I was in college -- it'd be a great bar game. Easily playable with just a deck of cards, though I do really like the biker gang art. (I'm not nearly as keen in the "Skull" version, with flowers and such.)  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Skull is a very good party game with both bluffing and push your luck elements. Very suspenseful when a player is turning over the mats.

Better than I expected.
It's almost pure bluffing and it reminds Liar's Dice, but at least there are some authentic emotions here (contrary to LD).  This is just better game than LD.

Too long for what it is with 6 players.  Possibly the best with 4-5.

Warning: wears out quickly.  Don't play it often.

Skull is a great quick game for fans of poker-like psychology and bluffing. At first, it will seem very random. The more one plays, however, the more one discovers the strategies that can help them navigate the nearly invisible minefield in front of the players (or force others to navigate it).

Dec '11 - dropped to 8.5 I still enjoy the game, but it suffers from being a little bit "not enough game" for most of my group. This means we aren't playing it, and points out a weakness in the game.

The game is much longer than it should be for the complexity. On top of that there are situations, before someone is kicked out, where that person can't win. So, there will be many situations in a game that are anti-climactic.

Both of the above together makes this a boring game. I love the simplicity but those faults really drag the game down for me.

Bonus fault: Someone who's not paying attention or just keeps passing and putting random cards down will make the game more random *and* may end up stronger in the endgame! (Not looking and putting anything down without looking makes reading them useless while always passing in the auction will mean they will never lose cards.)

When I played Skulls & Roses for the first time I didn’t like it very much. I thought that there was barely a game there and I didn’t want to play it again, HOWEVER I did play it again and I had lots of fun on my second play, after all I love bluffing games :D. BUT to have fun with this game, you need the right game group (or drinking group). 

It is very easy to teach and it takes a (relatively) short play time and those are the best features of the game. Perhaps is at its best with players with almost no experience playing boardgames.

The art is pretty cool but perhaps a little overproduced for the needs of the game. 

Skulls & Roses is a game I can play from time to time, but not one I feel the need to own or to request.

2017-07-12 - I'm optimistic that Skull will move up in my estimation as we play it more and get deeper into the bidding strategies. Our first play was a little less interesting than I would have liked, but it's fast enough that I'm hoping we'll keep at it, and give it the time it needs for to reveal the hidden depths I honestly believe are there.

RATING: 7
Bluffing reduced to the max. While Liar's Dice still needed dice to give a base for players' bids, Skull & Roses uses coasters (one each with a skull, three with roses) that players put on their mat. From others' bids and/or minds the players have to guess who bid the good roses and who has bad skulls. Needs the right group of at least 4 or 5 who like to play other players and not only the game to really work but then it's one of the most fun 15 minute fillers around.

Taking deception games down to the smallest denominator, skull is about as streamlined as it gets. Ridiculously easy to Print-and-Play and is sure to deliver a few laughs inside 45 minutes for 4-8 players (8 assumes two copies of this game or using your own components). 

The drawback to that simplicity is that you really don't want to play this with the same group more than one sitting per month (and that would be pushing it). It also overlaps significantly with games I find a lot more interesting (One Night Werewolf, Avalon, Sheriff of Nottingham, etc).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

My hopes were probably set a little too high, but I still hold out hope that the game will be a classic.  I really enjoy bluffing games and this one is so simple, yet produces some really fun moments.  I hope to revisit my comments once I've played further.

An interesting take on a bluffing game. Doesn't quite have the "in your face" ballsiness of Liar's Dice, but is a nice filler for this category

Nice, simplified poker feeling with very simple rules: you observe your opponents, you get to learn how they play/bluff/etc. You try to read everybody (because you need to access their piles). This immerses me instantly into the game.
Nice balancing mechanism: if you play it safe and don't take risk, someone *else* will win. If you're too agressive, you might die. It comes down to gauging your opponents, to be agressive enough without overdoing it, and reading people well enough to really select the right tiles to flip.
Short and social, with a strong "psychological"/reading/bluffing/poker face aspect. Quite unique, for me.

RATING: 5
A nice, shorter alternative to Liar's Dice, though it didn't really have the tension of that game for me. With Liar's Dice each round feels like it's progressing towards a showdown, whereas with this it's just pretty much the same thing over and over. Cute and clever, but I can take it or leave it.

A party bluffing game that is easy to learn and is a very pure version of its mechanic. However, I feel like where you're seated at the table has a large impact, and also once you fall behind, it's hard to recuperate. It doesn't help that I'm not a fan of pure bluffing on its own. Finally, while 80% of the games I've played have been of good length, the last 20% this game has overstayed its welcome.

Straightforward and simple bluffing game.  This is as stripped down and bare bones as you can get.  I like how you can be as exactly as pro-active as you want to be, yet the game sometimes punishes you for not stopping greedy players.

This can be played with an ordinary deck of cards instead. Simply split the AKQJ cards by suit and give a suit to each player, with the ACE representing the skull. With more than 4 players, also deal out the 10/9/8/7 of a suit to the other players, with the 10 representing the skull. With more than 8 players, also deal out the 6/5/4/3 of a suit, with the 6 representing a skull. The other cards are set aside and given out when a point is made (the suit/value of these cards doesn't matter).

Brilliant, nerve-wracking game of deception and daring.  Great way to kick off a game night!  Everybody I've introduced to his has gotten so into it and in the many times I've played it, it's never been the same game.    It's got the right amount of deviousness without feeling too mean.  And it often leads to players getting into some post-mortem "woulda, coulda, shoulda" as they analyze their last move.  A ton of fun in a nice, little package.

RATING: 7
This is the perfect example of how the simplest games are always the best. I can explain it in a few minutes but the understanding of the bluffing, tricking, face pulling deviousness that game play brings out will take a few games longer.

Play this with someone before you play poker and you will understand how to read their face and know when they are bluffing ... or will you as players are not always required to reveal their bluffs in this game.

For a game played with just four beer mats each it is just wonderful. Each player has three rose mats and one skull. Players take turns picking one of their mats secretly and putting it face down before them. After each player has at least one mat in front of them they have two options and must choose one on their turn. 1. place another mat face down on top of the previous mat before them or 2. start the bidding for how many mats they think they can turn over without revealing a skull (you must turn over all your face down mats in front of you before turning other players mats over). Once a player starts the bidding, players bid in turn order (or variant rules shout as fast as you can) highest bidder starts turning over mats. If you reach the number you bid without revealing a skull you get a point (two points wins the game). If you fail and reveal a skull the person who's skull it was blind picks a mat from those left in your hand and it is out of the game. The next round is always started by the player who turned over the mats irrespective of whether they were successful or not.

This game is just fun. We played it in the garden after a few beers and it went down a storm with a group of complete none gamers.

It kind of gives you the whole (coup, avalon, secret hitler) bluffing, deception vibe with just a bunch of beer mats ... and what lovely beer mats they are!

I suspect there are subtleties and metagame aspects that would come up after more plays. Nonetheless: fun, and I'd like to play it more often. It's a good warm-up game to perk up your mind before diving into meatier stuff -- IE, it's good filler.

I like the components, the simplicity of the rules, and watching people's reactions as they try to assess where things stand. Nifty game.

I'm a fan of minimal components and easy rules.  Hex is one of my favorite abstracts for this very reason.  Skull & Roses isolates the part of poker I enjoy and is VERY easy to teach.  Once everyone has gone through 2 test rounds they pretty much understand the game.

RATING: 7
A great example of a good mechanic with nothing added to it.   I think it is often tempting for designers to add too much to an idea, and often time hurt the game. Skull does the right thing.  The dramatic slow reveal of the tiles is quite fun.  I like the idea that player elimination is a way to win, but not THE way to win.  The game should go fast enough where being eliminated wouldn't be too frustrating.    Of course with games like this, who you play with is going to be 90% of the fun; but the 10% the Skull brings is done well.

A wonderfully simple and classically elegant game of bluffing. Players have four coasters. Three are roses, one is a skull. Play goes around the table with players adding a face down coaster in front of them, until someone challenges the table. They're guessing at how many coasters they can turn over without hitting a skull, starting with their own entire stack and then continuing to the top coasters of any other stack. If they hit a skull, they lose the challenge, and a coaster. If they hit nothing but roses, they win the challenge. Two successful challenges wins you the game. That's it... and you would be forgiven for thinking there's not much of a game there. I did. But you'd be wrong.

A favourite timekiller game. Not as complex as Perudo/Liar's Dice but the lovely designs and simplicity draw people in. I find that it's super hard to keep track of who's passed and who made the biggest bid--the rulebook says you throw your mat into the centre of the table when you pass but I've never played a game where people were willing to do this.

Skull is a boiling down of the Liar's dice formula to it's core. It's a game that I really like, but couldn't find a group to play it. 

You have four coasters, one is a skull the others are flowers, one at a time players will play a coaster face down until one player bids how many they can turn over without hitting a skull. Then starting with their own pile they go for it. If they are successful they get a point if not they lose a coaster. Simple fun!

This game is simply fantastic. The rules are so straight forward and easy, but there's a ton of strategy that emerges. You can play many different ways and need to to counter other people's strategies. Or you can just dick around. I've played this with serious gamers and I've played it at 3am so drunk I could barely see my cards. Either way I was screaming at the other players when I saw that fucking Skull. It's just the fucking best.

Easily the most fun you can have using only coloured beer mats. A really decent bluffing game, akin to Perudo, but with more sabotage. Players bid on the number of Roses they can turn over without flipping a Skull card, and players only know what is in their own pile, so there's a lot of misdirection to be had - and a good bluff can take you a long way, as a player only needs to be correct twice to win the game.

Distilled bluffing into a game.  I need to play Liar's Dice again (played it in Red Dead Redemption) to compare to this game, but there is no flaw in this game, imo.  I normally shy away from player elimination, and this game is a little longer than coup, but the elimination aspect is what makes the bluffing meaningful.

I am not a big fan of these bluffing games where you either over think your move ad-nausea, or you just 'roll the dice' and take a gamble.  Neither of these two decisions appeal to me very much.

Despite these drawbacks the game does play very quick, it plays great in a party atmosphere, and sometimes you can deduce what the proper play would be.  On those rare occurrences that you can do this, I would imagine you feel like a genius (I wouldn't know, I haven't made a good move yet).

I enjoy it, and the artwork is impressive, however it has not  gone over well. Every game has been drawn out, with all but one player being eliminated over a 45+ minute period. I have not been able to break this meta, as you cannot win hands when there are 5 skulls thrown every round. I will drop only flowers and then bet the number I put down, but then someone else outbids me even though they will lose a coaster. 

It has devolved into basically a waiting game, where everyone is waiting for someone else to bet and lose their coasters. This is definitely an issue with how people have been choosing to play, but I wish the game could prevent this behavior.

After a particularly grueling Euro filled with long silences and intense stares at the table, Skull was the perfect release valve from all the tension and AP. The game is a wonderfully simple iteration of Liar's Dice; it can be played with any number of beer mats. Or playing cards. Or scraps of paper. And I love easy rule sets with a rudimentary components. I think this game would be perfect to play with gamers after heavy games like Scythe or anything from Lacerda, but I also think it would be great to play with non-gamers as an ice-breaker or a gateway. I think it even fits with gamers who are hesitant to try bluffing or social deduction games because I think the basis of Skull is essentially push-your-luck. Which I love!! There's no way to make this game better, so Skull gets a 10 from me.

An easy to learn bluffing game that may seem very basic at first but is really fun to play. Simply play a disk or try and guess how many discs you can turn over before revealing a skull. Each player starts with four discs and if you guess wrong, you lose one, if you guess right, you get one point. Two points wins the game and when you make your guess, others can outbid you, trying to flip a larger amount of discs without revealing a skull. You start with three roses and one skull, losing a random disc if you guess wrong. Lots of fun and plays a wide number of players.

Skull is a light bluffing game that's somewhat comparable to a shorter Liar's Dice. Players have four tiles, three of them depicting flowers and one depicting a skull. Everyone starts with a face-down tile, and then players on their turn have the option to place another of their tiles face down, or call a bid. The player names the number of tiles they think they can flip without flipping a skull. The other players can choose to up this bid or pass, and the winning bidder flips tiles. If they meet their bid, they get a point, otherwise, they lose one of their tiles. Play continues until someone gets two points. This is really not my style of game at all, but at least it's short.

A game of pure bluffing. It's Liar's Dice-esque, with less probability, and more laughing. When someone is executing a challenge, he involves the other players by being forced to choose from among their coasters. This is a lovely element. One of my new favorite fillers.

I was very sceptical at first - I thought this sounded like a simplistic dumbed-down spin on Liar's Dice, but I picked it up anyway as I thought it might go down well in my party games group among those who weren't so keen on probability calculations.

But during the second game it clicked - there's  more to this than first meets the eye, with layers of bluffing and pushing your luck that work together very nicely.

Probably needs to be played several times with the same group for full effect, and it might not be for everyone - the group was divided as to whether or not this was more fun than Liar's Dice, but overall in terms of fun and drama, this one wins it for me.

Everyone I introduce this game to loves it.  It is my go to vehicle for introducing unsuspecting people to the world of gaming.  I have seen more howling and laughter in a game of Skull than any other game I own.  Every bid is a spectacle.  And either way it goes, with them pulling the skull or actually somehow guessing all the flowers, everyone is shouting in glee.  Perfect game for after work happy hour.  The only problem is that once you show them Skull they may not want to play anything else.

Update: Decided to sell because I have Kakerlakenpoker Royal (which surprisingly I played both in the same session) which for 2 reasons are: easier to sleeve and I can play Skull with that deck. This is a case of needing to be resourceful with my collection, asking myself can I use components from a game to make another without wasting money. 

At last an improvement of one of most played games that I didn't care for: Bluff (Liars Dice).

No longer do I need to listen to the loud rattling and the mathematical probabilities of what could be rolled, instead players have more control of which of their cards to play and to a lesser extent when. Because of this aspect of either playing a skull or a rose means less focus on the probability but more of what your opponent does or says in the bidding.

Another thing I like is the tense reveal as you get to choose whose cards after all your own you get to flip. Good dramatic stuff, good bye Bluff.

This is a simple bluffing game, where each player gets 4 coasters. One coaster has a skull on the backside of it. On a player's turn they either add a coaster to their pile or start a bid. The winner of the bid has to flip X coasters starting with their own, without finding a skull. The player who hits 2 points first wins. It's cute, the edition I played had nice art. Very enjoyable.

2012-11-18: Definitely on my wish list -- looks like a great, quick six player game for non-gamers. However, I find the game a bit repetitive. I wouldn't want to play this game more than once in a session.

The game feels more like push-your-luck than bluffing. The minimalist game mechanics don't give you many hints to deduce what your opponents have done.

The ultimate simple game that keeps getting played. It's probably been played 100 times in our club.

Simple, fun bluffing.

Player elimination can be a drag as the game might continue for 15 minutes or more after you're out (although doesn't usually).

Also the game can be ruined by scuffs and marks on the pieces IF you've got players who are competitive enough to notice and use that information.

A genius game, though, as you can literally play it with almost anything. Just go into a pub, take four beermats each, have each player mark one of theirs with something on the face-down side, and you now have ALL the playing pieces you need to get going.

Great light, very fast bluffing/push your luck game - it's a like a simpler split between Liar's Dice and Coup.  My only complaint is that if they have made the very simple components more sturdy, like weighted plastic painted discs, then you could play this anywhere.  Actually makes me want to PnP a copy out of coasters.

In the realm of bluffing games, Skull (or as I have, Skull & Roses) was eventually dethroned by Coup. It's even simpler than that game, with less to remember and perhaps less to hold the interest of most gamers. It's still a fun game, but generally has less use now than when it first came out.

Very light and cool bluffing game. I think I thought it was going to be a bit more raucous, but it was much quieter than I anticipated. Fun game and I will keep it around, but I'm not quite sure how much play it will see yet. I'll need a couple more tries to realize that. The artwork on the coasters is such a draw, tho. Love that art.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.75
I usually enjoy playing Skull, but it's consistently aggravating to teach for some reason. I'm normally opposed to house rules, but I feel like Skull works a bit better if you play to 3 points to win rather than 2. 2 point games can be a bit anticlimactic as they can end so abruptly.

Party game favourite at ours. Can be played while drinking; doesn't take much space and can be fun even with diminished brain capacity. Simple enough that it can be even explained to a drunken person.

This game can literally be played by anyone. My (then) 8 and 10 year old nephew and niece beat a table of grown adults at this game. This table also included people over 60 (who don't generally play any games of any sort).

While simple and enjoyable by all. It also includes enough "strategy" and bluffing to appeal to gamers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The shout out bidding out of turn order and resulting bluffing make this game. It's like a simplified Welcome to the Dungeon, but vastly more suited to pub play (where it had to be invented). It's a guessing game, but it's a read the signs guessing game. Quick and fun - as all good pub games should be. Obviously "skull" might have had a double meaning while playing down at the local watering hole.

#73 on my Top 100 Games of All Time (2015)

The concept of this game is quite simple. It's all about bluffing your opponents and wagering on how you think everyone played in order to score a point. I've heard people say this game is not good with 3, but in my experience, if you play with 3 people that know that they are doing, it can be very tense. The components are really easy to manage as well. I have played this game while waiting in lines at GenCon.

Note:  If you're out a bar or restaurant and need something to play, just get a set of 4 identical coasters for each player, put an X on one of them, and you've got everything you need to play this game (as long as you already know the rules).

I've been looking for a good bluffing game without hidden roles ever since Liar's Dice lost its appeal. This is a solid replacement.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Players each have 4 double-sided coasters, one marked with a skull while the others have roses (the backs show your player symbol). On your turn, either put a coaster down (figure hidden) or make a bid for the number of coasters you can flip over without revealing a skull. If you bid, in turn order players raise or pass; bid winner starts flipping. You must always flip your own first, then may flip any other player's top-most unflipped coaster. If you succeed, get 1 point (2 points wins the game). If you fail, randomly remove one of your coasters (kept hidden from the other players) from the game. Repeat until someone wins!

[b]--- Comments ---[/b]
It's cute! Sort of like Liar's Dice, but simplified. It still has the same type of push-your-luck tension, although to a lesser degree and with less going on. I prefer Liar's Dice, but would certainly be willing to play this again. The game plays in just a few minutes, and is pretty fun!

Short, mediocre bluffing game.  Play it with folks who can't figure out how to bid in Liar's Dice.  I don't like that often the best play is to lose a 'life' on purpose in order to prevent the winner from winning.

Liars Dice meets mind reading, through the medium of beer mats. It doesn't matter how fancy your artwork is (& it is pretty fancy) ... they're still beer mats. However ... despite its minimalistic simplicity, I think this is a great little game; I liked it so much I immediately bought a copy.

This boils down the bluffing liar's dice and those type games down to what it really should be.  I think it might do better than Liar's Dice in all but one area.

Nice beer mats, yes. But as a game, there isn't much to say about it. This is an outbidding game without an actual game following once the outbidding's been done. At least I don't consider it enough game for me.

OK, I caved and bought it.  Skull is one of those games that can overwhelm a gaming session -- as in, everyone just wants to play Skull.  So sometimes I'm a little wary of putting it on the table.  But if I ever colonize Mars or something, I'm bringing it with me.  Never met anyone who didn't have a blast with it, me included.  Just pure gaming goodness.

Quite a surprise hit, and I'm pretty sure this will replace Liar's Dice in my collection. I thought Coup would replace Liar's Dice since they're both bluffing games, but they have quite a different feel. Skull, on the other hand, feels very similar to Liar's Dice. Great game.

RATING: 7
Quick and easy bluffing game that is actually surprisingly hard to teach. This is, of course, relative, but the game seems like it should be explained in 1 minute.

It also, takes longer than expected for new players to "get it". At first it just seems like there isn't even a game there.

It could be my teaching, but I am usually complimented on my teaching abilities. 

After the awkward start, though, this one usually takes off. The only thing that can bring this one down is if you have a table full of conservative players.

The new version is beautiful and I did by two copies so I can play more than six. I haven't yet, but it will happen.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 5
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 5
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4


Overall - 5

RATING: 4.5
Beautiful artwork and production in the Skull edition, but the gameplay was underwhelming.  Perhaps it was groupthink, but it just seemed like there was no reason not to bid immediately, which kept the bids small and quick.  The game's not broken, but just doesn't seem compelling relative to better bluffing games.  I'd rather play Liar's Dice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A clear relative of Liar's dice with the added choice of trying to figure out where you'll look for your bid roses. Unfortunately spoiled by being forced to always choose your from your own pile first.

Players play either skull or rose coasters until someone starts a bidding war for how many roses can be successfully turned over without find a skull. Players can choose the top coaster in any player's pile (once they have played all of their own)

There's not enough information to play as Liar's dice, the choices are too granular, people can win too quickly, and the end-game (if you don't sudden-death win) is deeply unsatifying, once you get down to a few players, particularly once someone gets a skull only.

I need to make a point of playing Skull more often. The SUSD guys rave about it, and our group's really had a good time with it the few times we've played it.

RATING: 6
A simple bluff game that works.

There isn't much to say about this game, it's a bluff game that works well and creates enough table talk to be called a game. It really can be played with just a few standard cards although I admit the components of this box are much cooler.

After initial plays it seems like a fun game, very similar to Liar's dice.  

I got the feeling that it was a little too easy to win though.  One good round gives a player a huge advantage and it becomes their game to lose, instead of everyone's game to win.

And I'd rather play with fewer players rather than more.

Very light game of deduction with partial information available. Something along the lines of Divinare or even Coup. Light, fast and very little down time. Game gets easier over time as players are whittled down and more information is available. However, the deduction part is still quite luck dependent. The more you know your opponents and their personalities, the better you will play assuming you can read bluffs and play styles.
Not a bad game to pull out occasionally with a casual crowd but not something you pull out for a gamer's night or play 10 times in a row. I don't really think this game is suitable for a fresh group of players that haven't known each other very well or gamed together. Playing the bluff is important.

Bumped up rating to 7. This is actually a pretty fun game for different crowds. I would think a 4-5 player limit is about the right size. I love the light yet subtle interactions. Bluffing remains the key idea in this game.

Need to play it more.  I was immediately smitten with the simple rules and how nonstop tense it is.  Every second you're staring someone wondering if they're bluffing or not.

Like [gameid=45], but more complicated.  Thing is, I don't think that getting more complicated actually helps the game any.  Skull and Roses is still gauging the same types of group probability, and the same kind of bluffing, but doesn't have the charm of Liar's Dice.  It is faster, although that can be houseruled out of Liar's Dice without too much difficulty.  I don't see myself ever asking to play this one again.

This is a game that distills the bluffing element of Liar's Dice down to its own little game.  All players place down a tile that is either a skull or a rose.  Starting the the start player, players either add a tile to their stack or make a bet on how many roses they can find among all the players' tiles.  Once the bidding starts, continue until only one bid stands, and then that player reveals tiles, starting with his own and then picking them from other players in any order.  Meet your bid twice, and win the game; miss the bid, and lose a tile; lose all your tiles and you're out of the game.

I don't see this being a fun game for people who don't like bluffing games.  Those who do should have a blast with it.

If you liked the idea of Coup, but didn't like all of the shuffling of cards and exchange of coins, you'd probably really like Skull (like I do). Now, that's not to say you should ditch Coup, quite the contrary: I still think Coup is a better game. However, Skull is a great little filler for people where Coup might be too much. It's also probably the better game to play while having a beer or two.

Brilliant game. Unlike most other games, the information needed to play this game well is in people's faces (and gestures, etc.). The card play is so simple, you could teach anyone, but the bluffing and sussing of people is a skill you'll be quick to learn, if you are willing. To all those people thinking this game is random with no strategy, this is not a matter of opinion, I sincerely think you are completely wrong. Play several games with your close friends, on a high table where your eyes meet often, and watch their faces (and gestures, etc.) as much as you can. I guarantee, you will find the tells you're looking for, and through playing a few games, strategies will reveal themselves. Add table talk to this mix and you've got, imo, the perfect bluffing game, dripping with tension, ribbing and laughing with your friends.

First boxing sim I owned and it still holds up up. While I am looking forward to the new version this one still plays out well.  I prefer dice over FACs unless someone creates an auto FAC flipper, which has been done here to increase randomness.  There is enough to cause the occasional upset but not unrealistically.

Mechanics are laboured, but for afficionados just to read the cards is enough of a turn on.

I really enjoyed this.  I'm not a hard core boxing fan, but I watched Sugar Ray Leonard, Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson, and Larry Holmes back in the day.  It's easy to learn and doesn't take that long to play.  Like [thing=4453][/thing], it is a simulation.  It's downpoint is that you are more of an observer than a particapant.  You do get to manage a little bit of strategy, so in that sense, you are kind of like the corner man instead of the fighter, just like in basketball, you are the coach, rather than the player.  On the good side, it gives you chance to have Ali fight Joe Louis and Jack Johnson fight Joe Frazier, or have the two Sugar Rays go at it.  So you have GOT to love that aspect.

Great boxing simulation.  Wish there were some updated boxer cards with 1990's-2000's individuals.  Loved setting up tournaments in my childhood..could play this all day.

In my teen years, I would set up tournaments of 16 boxers and run a 10-round single-elimination.  

Game is a "6" compared to recent games, but gets a "9" on nostalgia factor.

There is hardly any game here -- the only decision point is to decide on one of six strategies at the beginning of a round, and you don't even get to do that in every round (also, some boxers can go into "Cover Up" mode during a round).  The strategies simply apply some modifiers to card results.  Beyond that, the gameplay consists entirely of flipping the next action card and looking up the results.

On the plus side, over 400 individual boxer cards are included, many with bios on the back.  Interesting stuff for people into this genre of stat-based sports sims. (Personally, when it comes to sports sims, I'd rather play a video game.)  I sometimes pull this off the shelf just to read through the cards, even though I have little interest in actually playing the game.

Stage all the great fights that never were: Ali-Marciano, Louis-Frazier, Jack Johnson-Jack Dempsey etc. This system WORKED.

Pretty much of interest only to the solitaire sports replayer, for which the game generates a pretty good narrative. But unless you are deep into the history and really working to interpret the numbers, the game gets numbing after awhile. Once every couple of years I take the game down and set up an elimination tournament, but find my enthusiasm has evaporated by the time I am through the first bout.

In my opinion the best Boxing board game simulation. Over the years the more that I learned about Boxing history the more impressed that I was with the amount of research that went into creating the cards. The only other Boxing game that I enjoy nearly as much would be  Championship Boxing by Owzat Games which would rank a close second.

Play with 500 Current (as of 1979 and up to 1990) and all time great Boxers for each division class. Create Tournaments, Arrange fantasy matchups and title bouts. Ali vs Marciano?

RATING: 8
Simply one of the best sports simulation games of all time.  I was not a huge boxing fan when I first bought it around 1980, but the game was so good it turned me into one.  Unfortunately, I have to rate it as of today (2006), and of course fiddly elements like the deck of 80 cards of which you must randomly pick 40 for each round prevent a higher rating compared to more recent games with smoother board play mechanics.  However, various computer iterations of the game have kept up with times (to date I have tried six of them after buying two copies of the board game -- the first one simply wore out from overuse) and I highly recommend the most recent one that can be found at www.ootpdevelopments.com called Title Bout Championship Boxing 2.

Many of the sports games on my list receive high marks, because they remind me of my childhood. I ran many, many, many bouts (and tournaments) with Title Bout. It holds the record (for me) of being the game I played the fastest after receiving (actually ceasing to open any more presents and sitting down to play Ali-Marciano on X-mas morning, snubbing my family the rest of the day!)

I found no better sports game for solitaire fun, and I'm including the legion of dreadfully boring baseball games here (and I played many of them.)

This game had great narratives and drama, and lots of cool historic boxers.

I played a long "all-star" heavyweight champ tournament when my first kid was born (the family was going to sleep at 8 every night.) My "title bout" had Joe Louis taking on an undefeated Rocky Marciano. I played dozens of fights ... and what do you know, Louis knocks Marciano out cold with the first punch of the fight. A 1 in 10,000 chance.

Really enjoyed this one.

(Its funny, but for having grown up with Ali, Frazier, Foreman, Chuvalo, Teófilo Stevenson and the great 1976 US Olympic team, I now absolutely loathe boxing, excepting for Olympic boxing, now that its reformed. See Bogart in "The Harder They Fall" for a good timeless flic.)

RATING: 8
A fun game, with the fast action card system that moved things along and works particularly well for emulating the punch-by-punch pace of boxing. Lots of rules, but one can pick and choose because not all of them are necessary for a basically good simulation.  I played out several division tournaments and of course was thrilled to see my idol, Ali, come away with the heavyweight crown. Many fun hours playing this one. My rating is based on how I viewed the game at the time I played it (late '80s, early '90s). It's easy to look back and rate a game based on a detached perspective, but when I played it I was INTO it, as it was a blast, so I'd still recommend it to others who might be interested in a boxing simulation. Out of print, of course.

Awesome boxing history in a box.  Possibilities are endless; old school vs. new, famous vs. obscure.  Now I know where half the sports bars get their names!  Fan updates are available online to keep this game alive.  Great solitaire game too.

RATING: 5
Another one of those classic Avalon Hill games I grew up loving.  Passed a lot of time playing this solo, setting up tournaments for each weight class, and keeping rankings that the fighters moved up and down, with occasional title fights.  Yeah, there is a trend here.  I was a stats geek who passed countless hours playing games by myself, because I did not know anyone else who wanted to play.  I'm sure that is where my love of solo and cooperative games comes from.

RATING: 7
Excellent flow: good feeling of a boxer being in control, or just hanging on until the bell rings. Tons of fighters. Not much decision making, though. I once played the computer version and felt like the game was playing without me. Does the board game still have the "international head butt" foul?

Great statistical sports game if you take the time to really get into 'managing' a group of fighters. The built-in statistical variations do allow for some surprises although this can be played very much as a solitaire game. Played hundreds of times.

Like the old time boxers.Made a list schedule of all the famous bouts from 1910 to the 1960's,and refought them to see if the boxers could have done better than they did historically(made up a point system for the bouts Eg: Ali fights 4 matches to see how he scored and match his score up with other boxers in what they did in their 4 bouts).

I love sports and this is the best sports simulation I&#039;ve ever played.  You can tell an exhaustive amount of research went into developing the player cards.  Granted, not everyone enjoys table-top boxing matches, especially flying solo, but if you do and you&#039;re a boxing fan, it&#039;s a must have.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I'm a boxing fan. If you aren't you probably don't need this game. If you do, it's a statistically based game that let's you choose a tactical approach round by round, like a manager might do in the corner, and unlike in the real world, your boxer will always at least attempt to follow instructions. Beyond that, you play the cards and observe what happens.

There is a wealth of statistical information in the cards, with a very large number of boxers represented, and on the whole I'd say the stats are well done. As with any such game, the joy comes in allowing you to vicariously enjoy re-living classic matchups, or creating ones across generations to explore might-have-beens.

I like the randomness of the fast action cards for determining results but they are a pain to shuffle after every other round.  So far I have played only the basic rules, and there are NO decisions for the player to make.  Just flip the cards and see what happens. (But oddly, I still enjoy this...I am an APBA Baseball basic game player, after all)  Looking forward to trying the more advanced rules. Current rating is for basic rules.

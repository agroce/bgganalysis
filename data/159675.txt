1-27-15: I really enjoyed my first play of Arle.  Wow, there are a lot of choices!  The game is definitely challenging and stressful in the way that there aren't enough actions to get what you want done.  However, rating may go up or down depending on replayability, since there is very little randomness and very little blocking.

An easy-breezy worker placement game continuing the theme of farming/agriculture well-established in previous Rosenberg games.

The game takes place over 9 rounds, signified by half-years/seasons, with each player having a set number of 4 workers and there being all of the actions available for each season right from the outset.  You have your own player board/principality as well as your own barn/garage for storage of your farming vehicles.  The actions consist of such things as plowing fields, cutting peat, obtaining animals, goods, building buildings etc.  Yes the usual suspects for the most part, although there are some differing and thematic actions such as upgrading tools and digging dikes and so on.  There really don't seem to be any bad options, simply a very good action vs a good action.  The "twist" is that 1 player can jump across to the other season to choose an action, but in doing so, blocks the other player from doing this and they also forfeit being start player for the next round (and it's always good to go first).

Nearly everything is worth points (which is the goal of the game), from clearing peat, to buildings (a major way to score), accumulating animals, collecting resources, vehicles, and travelling.  A very interesting feature is the vehicles; you can construct them and store them in your garage (space is limited) and each round you can load your vehicles with goods that then get automatically upgraded and you can travel to towns to gain food for goods as well as points.  Simple, intuitive and thematic.

The game is very peaceful and intuitive, particularly if you've played his previous designs.  It actually sounds very similar, but plays differently enough.  There is a harvest of sorts at the end of each round/season, but it's less stressful; you get some benefits, and your costs are fixed and a lot less than say in Agricola or Caverna.  Paying is not overly difficult to say the least.  This design is at least as thematic as any game Rosenberg's designed and it obviously plays great as a 2er, but there is my biggest issue with it- while I appreciate a great 2er as much as anyone, this is a very limiting player count (only 1-2 players), and as such it will limit it's opportunities to get played.  

Has some variability with the buildings but a building expansion is obvious and perhaps even needed as there's not a lot of different buildings.  It would be nice to add at least the option for a third player, but it sounds like this is not going to happen.  Great components, great theme, easy smooth gameplay, enjoyable, but limited due to the player count.  Surprisingly different enough to warrant a purchase if you enjoy Agricola and Caverna.

As with Ora et Labora and Le Havre, this is pushing the upper limit in terms of number of resources and/or actions available while still being an enjoyable game.  A few more plays will determine where I rank it.

After 3 plays, my interest is waning.  Not good as a competitive game since it is almost completely a solitaire exercise and not really a solo optimization puzzle I'm interested in exploring.  Set up time is quite long and the game is too wide open for my tastes.

I'd love to play this more. Unfortunately, it's not the cheapest nor smallest game out there, and since it's strictly for 2 or less, I settled for Caverna (which may be less good but is still a cracker and offers similar joy).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
An interesting take on the Rosenberg model: a game where virtually everything is plentiful. Food isn't particularly scarce, space isn't particularly at a premium, and it's pretty easy to get the resources you need (though it is slightly harder to upgrade them). 

I liked the concept of pushing back the sea by extending dikes (even if doing so seems a bit too easy), and the tool mechanic is an interesting spin off of the normal resource accumulation as the rounds progress familiar to other Rosenbergs. 

Rating on this one may improve with more plays and versus an opponent (as opposed to solo), as this certainly strikes me as a better fit for beating an opponent versus besting the game itself. 

Looking forward to the English release of [i]Tea and Trade[/i].

1st play: Wow, what a gigantic sandbox. We had no idea what we were aiming for, but we each sort-of picked a goal and built toward it. I enjoyed this game, but there were a TON of moving parts. Gathering resources, trying to convert them to the right things, to build the buildings and vehicles I want. I really liked the vehicles, it made harvest time more interesting, and turned it into a mini-game all of it's own. The buildings are tough to build, but they seem to be the key to a high score. The spatial aspect of the board is not super important, but it does matter a little bit, and housing animals is very easy in this game.

2nd play: I enjoyed my play of this, but it's a VERY open sandbox, and it's easy to flounder a bit without some sort of direction. In Uwe's other games, there are certain objectives to go for, but in this one, there isn't much guidance. The result for some people can lead to AP, which isn't a problem for me. However, my primary Uwe partner gets bogged down in all the choices and makes me not quite as excited to play again. I do absolutely LOVE the vehicle and harvest mechanics in this game, and I hope he uses these mechanics again.

This is now my favorite 2 player game to play with my wife.  All the depth of Agricola without the frustration.  Though it lacks the "replayability" mechanism of the occupation/minor improvement cards, so far we've had a blast.  The competition for roles is not as cutthroat and you never feel like you've been cut off at the knees, something that has rather unpleasant consequences when playing with your SO!

This is the last Uwe big-box game I'm dead-set on adding to my collection. Wide open, optimized for two players, and deep decision space. Yes. Please. The more I play Rosenberg's games, the more I am infatuated with his designs, whether based on scoring, interaction, or decision space.

Very good worker placement game. I can find many similarities to Le Havre, Agricola and Ora et Labora. Still the mix + new mechanics makes this game unique enough to leave it in my collection.

cart/wagon mechanic is fun cause it's a choice betweem upgrading material or selling something

food management is import in first 2-3 season
tool improvement gets more important in late game
wood and clay are always in shortage. building parks might be a solution

very good solo game

Follows a familiar Uwe Rosenberg formula, with just enough tweaks to make it different from Cavricola. It's a little more of a sandbox, and a little more detailed thanks to the focus on two players. Ideal way to spend a few hours with a significant other.

Once you get past the "yet another Uwe farming game" theme, there's a lot of great stuff to find in here. Very heavy 2-player-only worker placement game with a ton of choices. Everything fits together beautifully. Half of the building tiles are randomized each game which gives a nice amount of variability in the setup. Warning: this consumes a large amount of table space!

It's a two-player only game.

Al principio la cantidad de cosas que puedes hacer es abrumadora. El juego pone todo tipo de acciones y herramientas a tu disposición para que establezcas tu estrategia desde la primera acción del primer turno. A diferencia de Agrícola o Caverna aquí no "pierdes" turnos tratando de conseguir la dichosa comida o ampliando la familia para que luego (si te quedan acciones) puedas hacer lo que te interesa. De los tres juegos de "granjas" que he probado este es el que más me ha gustado.

Excellent game of forward planning. The new Agricola.

This game is going places...

EDIT after a few plays: I'm really enjoying this game, but my mates are not really excited about it because of the many options of available actions that are open since the very beginning. It seems to have a learning curve for newbies that is not trivial.

A wonderful game by Uwe Rosenberg, honing and perfecting many of the mechanics he used on his prior games like Agricola and Caverna, for that smaller player count. The mechanisms are simple, but there are many you can use, and you get that familiar, tactile sensation of clearing your lands of moors, moving dikes to hold back the tidal flat, buying and mating animals, and using a wide array of actions to buy buildings, increase the number of tools you can use, or even travel to local rustic destinations to trade. The theme can't be beat, it's the most personal for the designer yet, and it has just this amazing, humble, pastoral feel to it. I think it is his best game, yet, with the caveat that it only plays 1-2.

Initial rating, based on playing once. Uwe evolved (as are all his games). Lots of echoes from Ora et Labora and Farmers of the Moor. Pretty tight, and works well, though I have my doubts about longevity, as replayability/variety seems pretty limited, with only a few buildings being swapped out from game to game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
On the surface, Fields of Arle is a daunting game to play; there are 30 different actions in the game and not much to direct/limit you. For this reason, the game can be a bit befuddling to play and come across as non-confrontational. And truth be told, after my first play, I felt the game was more of a solitaire experience than a tense worker-placement game (e.g. Agricola). But through playing more games, I learned to value the actions and predict what my opponent was doing. Suddenly the game felt more like race to certain actions/builders, which created a healthy amount of tension.

More importantly, this is a game with tons of interesting decisions. While the lack of randomization may seem to limit the replayability of the game, the game manages to create a plethora of useful strategies. And because of the indirect player confrontation, the game also manages to be quite tactical. The end result is a game that encourages players to plan their turns out far ahead but one that feels quite different each game as players react tactically to their opponent's moves. Nothing about this game plays itself or seems obvious... it's the type of game that you continue to think about after finishing.

If you are a euro-gamer and a fan of point-salad/optimization games... you need to take a close look at this title. It's remarkably good. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
My favorite Uwe game (although a Feast for Odin comes in a very close second and actually has been played more). 

Love the game play of Fields, so many tough decisions. The end result of seeing what you have built up is awesome. And that is why it gets the nod over Feast.  The gameplay of Feast is awesome but the end result is tile laying to me (which is fine). In Fields I feel like I worked towards and ultimately built something on my board.

Köszönet a szabálymagyarázatért Obinak, végre kipróbálhattam ezt is. Már több KecskemétCON-on is szemeztem a játékkal, de valamiért nem került rá eddig sor. Nem egyszerű játék, de bevallom én még összetettebbre számítottam. Szerintem nem komplexebb, mint a Le Havre vagy az Ora. Pontszámban pedig azonosra értékelem a többi klasszikus Uwe játékkal (8), mert bár sok eredeti ötlet van benne, és tök jól működik, de ez max 2 fős, és még 2 fővel sem jobb, mint amazok!
Mik a jó ötletek: a két évszakra osztás jó, a szerző a kismillió akcióban hozza a tőle megszokott aprólékosságot, és elég tematikusak is az akciók. A két évszak közti fejlesztési sávok tetszenek! A kezdés joga és a másik évszak akcióinak korlátozott használata nagyon jól ki van találva (ha használok egy akciót a másik évszakból, akkor tuti a másik kezd majd abban évszakban). Tetszik, hogy végre nem minden nyersanyaghoz tartozik 100ezer lapka, hanem jópárat sávosan oldottak meg. A 2 oldalas (fejleszthető) lapkák nagy részének fejlesztésére pedig ott vannak a járművek, amik új színt hoznak a korábbi játékaihoz képest, de kicsit egysíkúbbá teszik talán a játékmenetet, mert ha van elég kocsim, azzal túl sok mindent meg tudok oldani. Kevésbé kombozós emiatt a játék, mint mondjuk az Ora vagy a Le Havre. A travel sáv, és a kajáknak ez a (szintén a járművekkel megoldható) módja ötletes. Új elemek a gátak, ez is jól működik, és az állatok számítása SOKKAL jobban tetszik, mint az Agricolában. Nem bonyolítja ezt a részét feleslegesen. És a tehén rohadt jól néz ki:)))
Változatosságra szerintem nem veszi fel a versenyt a kártyás elődök egyikével sem, gyanús, hogy ha valaki jobb játékos nálam, akkor még nagyobb arányban meg fog verni, mint pl. 2 személyes Agricolában (mármint az eredeti Agricolában, amit csak ketten játszunk). Összességében hozza a szokásos szintet, sajnos újra csak mezőgazdaság a téma, ez kicsit már uncsi... Komolyan bent lehet ugyanaz a szerző 5 mezőgazdasági témájú játékával a top100-ban, amiből némelyik szinte a másik újrakiadásának tűnik? Úgy tűnik igen, és még ez a játék lóg ki talán legjobban az 5-ből, tehát ezért nem is szólhatunk semmit:) Uwe rajongóknak kihagyhatatlan! Aki 3 órás összetett 2 fős stratégiaira vágyik, az se hagyja ki (úgy hallottam, sokadjára csak 2 óra).

RATING: 9
Only a few solitaire plays so far, but I really like this game. There are numerous paths one can take in your farming approach as you try to maximise output with an efficiency of moves. Yet it never feels clinical; decisions made tie organically with the game's theme, which has a kind of old-world charm of farming practices of yesteryear when the world was just a bit slower-paced and unhurried. Seasons come, seasons go in gentle rhythm - harvest, winter preparation, spring and summer - as time drifts by over 4.5 years of 9 x "6 month" rounds. And at the end, you look at your board with a certain pride at what you have produced - arable land, buildings, barns, livestock, farm equipment, wagons, textiles, merchant trade and so on. Oh yes, and you happen to score points for all that, too.
The board artwork is beautiful and playing pieces lovely quality. 
To make a game your autobiography is an amazing effort, and Uwe has done a wonderful job capturing the nostalgia of his childhood growing up in this region. 
Mind you, I would have made a rotten farmer ... I still can't bring myself to send my cows, horses and sheep to the tanner and/or butcher.

Very, very clever design. I love the travelling aspect and the conversion aspects.

Well, yes, it resembles other Uwe's agricola-clones, but it has the benefit of almost nonexistent round setup. It also has a steep learning curve since even experienced Uwe fans will find it confusing at the first play. Best feature is the action that lets you permanently boost your other actions.

Surprisingly short setup time. Rules are also surprisingly simple and easy to understand. Manual could have been structured better but is ok.

Good Production Value also the stickers you put on the tokens are not that sticky and peel partially off pretty quick.

I was surprised how often this game hits my table. It's actually fun and you do think about how you going to get certain Buildings. 

Quick Tip: Don't try to earn too many points with your food. Look at the VP of Buildings. They are quite effective.

The game play is quite open and there is quite a bit to explore within the game. I will continue playing this game to explore its decision space. However, after I finish a particular session, I don't feel a strong desire to play it again immediately (unlike Agricola).

Update, July 2017: After playing a few more times, I just don't see a reason to play this over Agricola or Vinhos. The vehicles, tile flipping and destination track are somewhat compelling but much of the remaining aspects of the game just feel a bit plodding (which is probably due to my general dislike of resource conversion). I'm going to move this game out of the collection.  However, I will note that one of the strongest aspects of the game is its breadth of decision space while preserving a fairly simple rule set.

Easily the best 2-player implementation of the series. Possibly the best overall? The only reason this doesn't get higher marks is because my interest in point salads is waning. I like games which have a more streamlined focus on what you are trying to do, which is perhaps why train games and abstracts have risen in my estimation.

Still want to give this some more plays to see if familiarity with the buildings, conversion chains, and resource chokepoints brings the underlying game theory into clearer focus.

I love All Creatures Big and Small as well as Glass Road, so I feel like a heavier version would be ideal. Two player is fine since that is normally what I end up playing. The solo option is very satisfying. It is one of the best solo games that I have played. The theme and worker placement hits a sweet spot for me. It does take up a huge amount of table space, which is the only negative. Once you know the rules, the gameplay goes quite fast as well. Additional random building tiles at the beginning of the game would be an improvement.

What I have noticed with these games is how you can really see the development of Uwe as a designer. This game introduced the "playing tiles to cover up stuff for points". I love how the resource conversion works in this. Vehicles were very tight to purchase. My reason for losing was my decided lack of animals. You really need to diversify to score well. Flo seems to always like these games (when and if I can get her to play) and this one should be right up her area of expertise. Great stuff!

A rich two player experience. Initially I thought it was too similar to Agricola and Ora Et Labora so I put off buying it but when I finally got this as a gift it shot up to the top of my favorite games list, especially since I play a lot of board games with only two players.

RATING: 9
Great game, great theme, fun tokens. My only wish is that I could get it to the table more often. It naturally shares a similar feeling to Caverna, but there is more differentiation between plays, even in the solo game. Whereas solo Caverna is 100% deterministic, Fields of Arle has some randomness to it. This randomness makes it valid to play each game differently. While that CAN be done in Caverna, you have to walk into those games knowing you're drifting off the "best" strategy. Fields of Arle has no single-best strategy thanks to the randomized elements, which frees you up to try new things every game.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
Much more interesting than I thought it would be.  Wasn't sure what else could be done with the farming theme, but this one works REALLY well.  While it was a little tough to form a strategy early, I think I got the hang of it about half way through the game.  One I very much would like to explore more going forward.  Probably a little too heavy to play with my wife, otherwise this would be a no brainer pick up.

Great game, even solo.  There is only one rule change in the solo version so it plays very easily if you've played with two players.  Like Rosenberg's other games, it's a constant struggle for the resources to end the rounds without taking negative points at the same time as accomplishing all of your goals for the round.  I really enjoy the mechanic which allows you to upgrade your tools allowing you to complete more and more as the game goes on without having to feed more faces like you do in Agricola, Caverna, etc.  Highly recommended if you enjoy Rosenberg's style of tense, strategic euro gaming.

RATING: 6.5
A fine game but nothing fantastic here in my eyes. I would rather play Agricola. I just wanted a bit more pressure or focus in the game, instead of a do whatever you want type of game. I think a lot of the buzz around this game will fade and it won't stand up as a true classic.

This beautifully crafted game is challenging and fun to play. I find it almost addictive, wanting to jump right into a second game after finishing the first to try a new strategy. The balance of actions feels pretty perfect and like most Uwe Rosenberg games, you can't do everything you want in your limited time, which keeps the game tight and engaging. You're always trying to optimize your move. Excellent game.

Another great Rosenberg. Need another couple of plays: only did once and both of us were first-timers. We probably got some rules wrong, but it was a fun game although I felt nothing new for Rosenberg. Definitely felt more 'open' than the tighter Agricola, or even Caverna or Odin. Looking forward to getting a couple more plays in and see this going to an 8 quite easily.

This game incorporates a very interesting "trade" mechanic that I'd really like to be carried forward into his new works.

Really good game that condenses the Rosenberg experience into a 2-player game while retaining a lot of depth. I really enjoyed that only a fraction of the buildings are the same every game to add some variability and avoid players from determining an optimal sequence of play. It was definitely a nice puzzle to try to solve but I wish the game wasn't so sandbox-y. I wish players would get a special power or an individual objective to give a bit of direction especially since the game is a bit overwhelming for a new player. Still, a solid and thinky game for 2!

Wow... this is a tough game to rank. At this point, I've played a number of Rosenberg games: Agricola (I like it less with each play), Le Havre (eh, it's OK), At the Gates of Loyang (shoot me now), Ora et Labora (love it!), Caverna (well, it's better than Agricola), Glass Road (not bad!), and now this.

It's another Rosenberg game that feels very much like a Rosenberg game. It's another massive playground for taking actions, converting resources, etc. What's different in this game? One thing that stands out is the aspect of getting carts/vehicles, which you need to convert and upgrade resources. Otherwise, a lot is very similar.

I don't know what to make of this game... heck at this point I haven't even explored everything that Ora et Labora offers, so why delve into this massive two-player-only game of resources? I was bewildered my first play, not knowing how all these various resources relate. I'd give it a shot again, but then again, I'm not sure how much I'm willing to invest in trying to learn this new system.

3/22/16 After two solo plays I'm not sure yet.
3/23/16 3rd solo play, hmm...
3/23/16 4th, starting to see it maybe.
3/24/16 5th play, the fun is starting to creep into the 'what the heck am I doing??' exercise that is FoA. I played Agricola between FoA plays to mix it up and the cards in Gric still make it king of the solo farming bgs, but with each play of Fields it reveals itself more and more.
3/30/16 8 plays in, sometimes art needs to reveal itself over time. A 10/10 for me, a masterpiece...solo game. Now to try to and coerce a friend into playing it. I'm really curious about the 2 player.

9/01/16 I finally got to play it 2p and it is even better! Almost my favourite game (FoA will have to duke it out with Forbidden Stars and Race for the Galaxy for my soul). I'm pretty sure I'll be able to bring into regular 2p rotation but I still want to play it solo (which is almost as much fun).

Open-ended resource conversion Rosenberg. The game is less tight than Agricola, and faster to play. There are almost no blocking opportunities, and thus the game is also less confrontational. It is a lesser game than Agricola, suffering from limited setup variability and carrying very limited innovation. The "derivative style" tool capabilities building is an interesting twist. The pastoral setting helps bring the theme out quite nicely and the art is really well done. This is a game that you can leisurly play and end feeling satisfied and serene. Very good, but not great.

+ solid design, as expected from Rosenberg
+ quality components and art
+ plays fast

= limited blocking opportunities and confrontation

- almost everything in this game has been done before by Rosenberg
- limited setup variability

Why do they call Rosenburg's games sandboxes and Feld's a point salad? And yet the sandbox is so admired, the point salad is so loathed? "There are a lot of ways to get points", from a video review. From a written comment, "Many resources, many actions, many conversion possibilities", same crap.

A kitty litter box.

Sigh.... Doesn't one Dice Tower reviewer ever get tired of this guy?

I guess as long as you keep changing themes you are golden. Oh wait it's farming again, where is the rant?

Another same old same old, higher priced then Caverna if you factor in the 2 player limit, not that Caverna should be played over 4, or under 3. 

Another game of the same game ilk as the rest this designer cranks out, games for those who aren't master of their own domain, playing this stuff is the same thing.

Totally dumbfounded by the love, the rankings of this.

Goes to show how a tight Fanboy group who are more apt to rate a game, then a regular buyer, can shew ratings. Magic, Dice Masters are another group that can do the same thing, with them it is a life style. 

My one set of Dice Masters is one set to many for me. My now 1 Rosenberg game, Bohnanza, is enough for me. Last original thought he had.

Big game, Similiar to Agricola without cards and a lot of choices. The winter/summer is neat. The vehicles, travel and delivery is really neat too.

I bought this for solo play. Not sure how it will stand up over time. Only difference from game to game is a few random building tiles. Is that enough to make one game more interesting then the next?

For solo play I prefer Agricola.

On a tous notre auteur préféré, notre film préféré, notre jeu préféré. Moi, c'est Uwe. Qui ? Uwe Rosenberg, l'auteur d'Agricola, de la route du verre, Ora&Labora (et de Bonanza). Et son dernier jeu, Terres d'Arle, est presque un jeu autobiographique (sur la vie de ses parents). On retrouve les mécaniques de prédilection de Uwe : de la pose d'ouvriers, de la transformation de ressources à foison, des animaux, des céréales. Et vous êtes parti pour 2 à 3 heures de jeu dans le monde rural. Et ... c'est un jeu à 2 uniquement !

Fun, but a little overhyped. There's not much tension, either from the opposing player or the game itself. Almost everything scores points, so it's difficult to really appreciate (or detect) what is considered skillful play. 

I'm not entirely against multiplayer solitaire in a good game, but for some reason, there is no real excitement at the conclusion of this game. Maybe my play is poor, but I don't really feel like my decisions were that interesting in this. 

I find the tension Agricola offers much more compelling from a game standpoint. The pressure of acquiring food as well as the blocking from that *best* spot is missing in FoA.

Arler Erde is an odd game in my collection. An involved two player worker placement game that takes (at least in my group) close to three hours to finish is not something that is easy to get to the table. With it's setting and focus on optimization, it's a very niche game that is not for everyone. But whenever I'm lucky enough to find someone who is willing to play it and I have the time for it, Arler Erde provides a great time. 
From a mechanical point, Arler Erde is more of an evolution of Rosenberg's other worker placement games than something completely new.  But within it's rather traditional mechanical framework, Arler Erde provides a fantastic experience. It's exhausting in a good way and leaves you with a great sense of accomplishment once the dust has settled.

While Arler Erde is a not a game for everyone, it definitely is something I enjoy. Now that I think about it: I need to get this to the table again as soon as possible.

I love the wide open decision space in this game. My mind is buzzing with possibilities and strategies to pursue next time.

My favourite heavy Rosenberg game.

This game is a solid, very nice design. However it is hard for me to love this type of point engine game without some dynamic spice, such as that provided by the occupation cards in Agricola, or the buildings in Le Harve.  With Fields of Arle, I feel like I do what I like for a while, make some points, then it ends.  I suppose it is too sandboxy for me, and end up feeling more like an activity than a game.

I do like the filling of the orders, and that the game is optimized for 2 players.  On the other hand, Agricola and Le Havre also play great with just 2, and are much less convoluted.

Fields of Arle is expansive and extensive. It is a huge sandbox in which to play. There are so many different avenues to go down, ideas to pursue and strategies to play with. It is free-form Agricola with all the limitations stripped away.

Playing Fields of Arle is a relaxing affair. You have plenty of time to do your stuff, you have no problems feeding your family, and you rarely find yourself stepped on by your opponent taking the space you really really wanted. After all there are a dozen or more alternative spots and most of them help you achieve stuff.

The downsides? Perhaps there is too much freedom. The game lacks competitive tension and ends up feeling like you are playing by yourself with a point add-up at the end to determine the winner. 

It is nonetheless enjoyable to play, especially if you like 2 player games without too much cut-throat competition.

This was my first foray into heavier games. Ive dropped its  ranking a little bit as Agricola passed this. I enjoy the Sandbox aspect. Ive tried animal husbandry, traveling, leather maker, seamstress and general balance strategies to varying degrees of success. I love the thematic feel to the winter and summer actions. Im able to bust out a solo game of this pretty quickly because of how Ive store the game to reduce the setup. There is only a bit of game driven variability (a few buildings) when compared to Agricola, but the variability comes from the player and how they decide to explore the game. The game gives you the freedom to do see because it is less punishing. I held off on getting Agricola because of this and while I like that better I would say that there is room for both in your collection.

Standard Uwe game; this won't change your mind about him if you don't like his other stuff. Per typical Rosenberg, there's a lot of tension in deciding how to spend your limited actions/resources. I really enjoy is the ability to upgrade your tools. Feels a little less linear (i.e., more sandbox-y) than some of his other designs, but everything fits well together. It's also far less punishing than his other designs.

2016-12-05 : This game seems to be the answer to the question "What if we took all the stress out of Agricola, multiplied all the options and then for good measure make it a 2-player so you're free to build your own agricultural engine with as little interference from other players as humanly possible." Well, they succeeded. And this is not necessarily a bad thing, you just have to be in the mood for it.

A great game by Rosenberg, only edged out by Feast for Odin. The fact that it only plays 1-2 seems to be a strike against it, but like Gates of Loyang, I can't imagine playing with more than two. An excellent sandbox game where you can go on any path you choose.

While I like Rosenberg, there are a few aspects of some of his euro games that bother me:

-Uneven number of workers for players through growing your family. I still have some games that have this feature, but it bothered me a fair bit in Agricola.

-Harsh 'feeding your people' conditions, where much of the game revolved around this.

-Forced generalization. I want to be able to generalize or specialize and not feel like I'm under the eight ball if I don't do that.

Arle definitely doesn't have the first two points. I feel like you can score in many different ways, or focus on certain paths (ie animals, goods, buildings, etc.). I feel like this is more of a point salad game where most things you do will get you some points. More of a point salad than other Uwe games. In case you didn't know, Fields of Arle is a 2-player only farming optimization euro that Uwe Rosenberg is known for. I was skeptical on the title, because, how many Uwe resource management euros does one need? 

This is a pretty thematic euro when you consider that during summer rounds you will be preparing crops, building buildings, doing other outdoor related activities, and preparing to heat your home for the winter. In the winter, players will be inside making vehicles, weaving wool, creating leather from hides, and other indoor activities. This kind of reminds of Viticulture a bit, which I've only recently played.

This is more of sandbox game with only a few variable buildings (much less than Caverna) to change the setup each time. So, the variability comes from trying various strategies each game. This does have a few unique mechanisms too when you consider the turn-order mechanism, upgrading assets to make them more efficient/gaining bonus points, and how you travel/upgrade resources with vehicles. 

I expected this to be a long game, in the vein of Twilight Struggle/Through the Ages, but you can definitely get this finished in 2 hours, but it still gives you a lot to chew on. While it looks like it has a lot of components, I didn't find it nearly as overwhelming as Agricola/Caverna/Feast for Odin (I guess because most resources have a marker which are tracked numerically on your board). It's a good game that I would recommend people try if they play 2-player games frequently. I, originally, liked this one a lot, but have cooled on it since. It's still a good game though.

SOLD IT!

Since these are often considered solitaire games, why not cut the other players out and make it for 1 or 2. Like many of Uwe's games it has tons of choices to make, which will cause some brain freeze. The game is lush and full of flavor. Set up is a huge pain.

We recently added this to the 10x10 challenge, and by the end of it had become burnt out and have since moved onto Feat for Odin which we prefer.

RATING: 7
Fields of Arle is a sandbox game by every definition. The options are vast and players are exposed to every aspect of the game from their first action. There is no variable setup or randomized objectives to guide a player's early decisions, forcing them to rely on their imagination to guide them. This expansive decision space is incredibly daunting and makes the game feel too open, but the game is actually quite tight, in the sense that each action and resource is vital. There are several paths to pursue, but varied play is purely in the hands of the players. The Fields of Arle are a place of exploration and experimentation, and if one finds a friend with whom to share the adventure they will have little reason to leave.

First things first, if you haven’t read Paolo Ciardulli’s review, [thread=1274148]"Uwe, what have you done again?"[/thread]  Do so, it is simply the best review of a game I have ever read on BGG.  Paolo’s explanation of decision space is brilliant and certainly opened my eyes to the differences between a game that has a wide decision space, which stimulates intuitive play and rewards mastery, and the much maligned point salad (a somewhat common, and incorrect, criticism of Fields of Arle), where quite literally anything you do will net you the same amount of points regardless of the decisions you make - ie, a game that essentially plays itself.  Very different things indeed.
 
Based on the strength of Paolo’s review alone, my wife and I came into this game determined to allow it time to show itself to us, and we have been richly rewarded for doing so.  Truth be told, for the first several games I found myself somewhat frustrated at the sheer number and scope of options in front of me.  I really didn’t feel like I was controlling anything at all and our scores were certainly reflecting that as they were all over the place.

Until it clicked.  Then the synergies and strategies began bubbling up to the surface and a game that felt somewhat random and disjointed started to feel anything but, and this “point salad euro” got real competitive, real quick.  The tightness, the tension, the increasing scores, its’ all there, all the time. 
 
This game has been a real treat to [i]discover[/i] and after nearly a dozen plays it just keeps getting better.  Thank you Uwe for a magnificent game and thank you Paolo for turning us on to it!

Some people may say it lacks interaction, for me it's just right. It seems there are many possible strategies to win which - as usual with Uwes game - well balanced. (Thats what I dislike in 2p Agricola) I have to find out and play again and play again.
Whats AWESOME is the style and how its embedded in the east Frisian history. I like learning. If you don't, sad for you, but that doesn't make the game worse for you.

Arle was awesome the first two times I played it, which were also the last two times I played it. At first, it seemed very sandbox where players can basically do anything they want and will always get points. Its not punishing like Agricola because players almost always have an abundance of everything. Not my style. It feels like multiplayer solitaire and there is little player interaction. There are also certain areas of the board that can be neglected without much harm and other areas that will cost a player the game if neglected. So in that sense it feels a little scripted. Setup is absolutely brutal which is part of the reason it didn't get plays and I'm glad I traded it for that reason alone.

As has been stated in other comments... this game feels like more of a sandbox style game than Agricola and Caverna and I'm not yet sure if I like that or not.  I am rating this one a bit lower than its predecessors due to there being points in the game where I felt it dragged a bit.  I never really get that feeling in Agricola or Caverna.  Still...  An excellent game that presents so many options it can be difficult to choose the best course.

Fields of Arle is the logical continuation of the Rosenberg resource conversion series that started with Agricola. The game includes a boxload of stuff (although resource management techniques have improved in recent years so managing the mountain of tiles isn't quite as onerous as in Le Havre, for example) and combines various elements of his earlier games to create... something quite solid, yet unsurprisingly it doesn't feel very original or even different.

Variability is a little higher than in Caverna, with only a selection of the available buildings entering play each time but still way behind Agricola. I am, in fact, a little uncertain how well it will hold up to repeated plays. The need to feed your family is still present but very much subdued, another development in line with the changes made on the path from Agricola to Caverna. As a result, Fields of Arle is a constructive village-building puzzle with a subtle dose of (rather non-confrontational) interaction and not much in the way of pressure or tension compared to earlier games in the series. A comfort game, perhaps.

RATING: 6
There are many mechanics that make me want to play... the dike moving, vehicle loading, land reclamation, and in general, building fields as I think I would like to.  There are also thematic elements that are really nice such as harvesting/sustenance differences based on the season. 

But the theme is occasionally strange, especially as a 2 player game.  For instance, when a player builds a building, the other player is prohibited from building that building for the rest of the game, and so one might build a building just to be mean to the other player (in order to beat them).  It may not only be frustrating for a player, but thematically, how does that make sense?  How the theme is implemented overall leaves a drier taste in my mouth than Agricola, even though the thematic atmosphere around this game is a little bit richer and distinctly more quaint than Agricola.  There isn't as strong a sense of adventure as in A Feast for Odin, nor the sense of intimacy and connection to the fate of your household as in Agricola.

The limitation of the player count is also a bit of an issue.  While the game is clearly optimized to be competitive for a 2 player game, I don't think the amount of blocking that happens in this game is really best suited for the theme.  The degree to which one gets limited by the half-year is too strong, and I feel deprived, but not in a way that feels meaningful or in a way where I feel like there's enough opportunity for me to want to excel in the remaining options.

On a small note, some of the iconography/cards could be clearer (ie brown arrow vs yellow arrow doesn't always jump out at players).

Overall, it has very strong strategic merits and is fun despite any frustrations, but I'd rather play its competition.

I've been wanting to play Fields of Arle since it came out and just had the chance.  The most fascinating thing about it is the two completely separate action chart for the summer phases and the winter phases.  Having to gauge the best times to use certain actions and when to hold off really held my interest through the game.  I like that there is a game like this only for two players and it definitely feels like a Rosenberg game and is different enough that it doesn't feel like a strict repeat of other games of his.  That being said, there isn't that much raising it above the typical Euro patterns of obscure, farming themes, heavy on resource management.  There were also a couple of parts that were strange to me, including the shipping resources to convert them to other resources and the whole "vehicle purchase" portion took me a little while to feel comfortable with.  The shipping cities option in order to increase your travels was also a little odd, but worked okay in the end.  All in all, an interesting game with one very interesting idea that actually carried it along for me the whole time.  But the similarities in theme and a couple of wonky aspects keeps it from being a high watermark game of Rosenbergs, in my opinion.

Really fun to play solo just for seeing what happens when you do things. The rule book is easy to follow and well organized. Two player would probably be just as much fun. The hard part is puzzling out where you want to place your 4 pawns every round and there's a lot of places to place them. It's such a vast open sandbox that I can't really describe it in short order.

I like Uwe Rosenberg but I'm constantly disappointed in him.  He's made two original games, Agricola and Patchwork and the cannibalized the hell out of them for every subsequent game.  This game is exactly like all the Rosenberg Agricola clones.  It's better than Agricola, Glass Roads and Caverna, but, it's not as good as A Feast for Odin.  It's VERY Similar to Feast for Odin, though, the only difference is Feast as unique player roles, more spaces to go to and the Patchwork tile placement element.

By the standards of a competitive game, the game is ridiculously obtuse and slightly bad.  The very idea of two people bringing it to a game night or something and playing together competitively kind of makes me laugh.  But as the logical endpoint of Rosenberg's puzzle designs for couples or by oneself, it's actually my favorite Rosenberg design.  I don't appreciate Fields as a game much, but it is a great puzzle.  And that has its place in my house.  I prefer it to Agricola despite it being a worse competitive game.

One huge positive to this design is it minimizes upkeep.  Sure, setup takes forever, but I'd rather long setup than continual turn to turn upkeep.  Huge improvement over Agricola.

(2017) The game has grown on me---it's the logical endpoint of what *I* like about worker placement as a low key, fun sandbox with many options.  Making it 2 player only was a great idea.

I've given it a few more plays recorded and unrecorded, and it's steadily growing better and better. There is competitiveness between both players, and valuing whether using the Imitate spot is worth 2 food.
A point salad to be sure, and one that I really really enjoy.

A highly OVERPRICED game! It is waaaaayyyy too expensive. No figurines, no custom dice or tokens, just plain old physical elements (old animeeples + other ordinary wooden tokens + cardboard).

What is most outrageous is that it is a 2-PLAYERs game! What?!? I need to pay almost 100$ for a freakin' 2-players game? What kind of fool or idiot would pay 100$ for a 2-players game?

I think the publishers of this game are putting the cart before the ox, are selling the bear's hide before killing it, and are overrating this game for nothing. It's not super good, it's a nice game, worth buying, at around 40$-45$ + tx, but that's it.

Some say that this game is better than Agricola played with 2 players... at some degree yes, I agree. But it's still a 2-players game and should be sold for 50$+tx max.

The game is nice like I said, but I will never buy it at the store, it's REALLy, REALLY not worth its price!

It would get a 9.5 if it had a reasonable price tag, but I dropped it to 8 for that.

An excellent 2-player Rosenberg game. Several playthroughs and I like the different mini-engines you can go for. The one negative point is that buildings seem absolutely essential, I don't think there is a viable goods-driven strategy yet. My high score in 2p is 104.5 at this point, I'll see if I can exceed that.

The component quality and design are top notch, and it's a wonderful experience. The worker placement is not overly competitive, nor would I call this solitaire. I think in more advanced play it will start to be clear when to actively negative the other person's plan (via the "special action").

After 4 plays - it feels nothing like Agricola. Hard to believe given that you can plow fields and raise animals. But there is so much going on that it feels VERY different. I'm enjoying the sandbox and figuring out exactly how to 'use' Arle. Not ready to rate yet.

After 9 plays -this is not Agricola! I was a little disappointed by this at first but I'm totally over it.

After 17 plays - there is so much to explore in this game! The solo experience has as much to offer as Mage Knight. Seriously. The decision space is huge, with early decisions having an impact on what you'll choose to do later on. The 2 player is very competitive (tried only once so far) and the unique way of changing start player via use of the Special Action works well. It's fun too!

While the rules suggest 110 points solo is remarkable, I would add that 100+ points feels pretty good. High score 122.

It was plain and it wasn't that much fun. always the same setting was boring for me. 
It need commitment to learn. (first game is just for learning because of too many choices to make. and it was too tough comparing the fun the game gives)
Teaching to somebody took long times. about 20-30min.
By the way, great component quality.

By far the most disappointing game buy I have ever made. My heart still breaks at the thought of the hard earned cash I spent on this. So many good games out there and I had to get this...

I mostly play games with a female friend of mine so a cute looking 2-player game with a farm theme seemed to be perfect for us. All reviews praised the game, the designer and the sandbox flow of play. And yes, it's a 2p game and yes, it has cute little wooden animals but it is no sandbox game. The game boasts about all these different paths to victory but in reality every path follows one another. There is no pick and choose. You start by buying carts to convert goods. Then you sell them to villages which automatically fills up your travel meter and gives you tons of food which you use to buy castles. That's it. At every play. Carts -> goods -> villages -> travel points & castles. 

Of course you could in a complete brain dead fashion simply get carts to just collect goods but who does that if you can get free points by selling them to villages? Or, theoretically you could simply raise animals but again, who does that when you can get free points for selling them to villages? And then you're buying castles again since all the other buildings are weak, low in points and ironically much harder to buy than the point-heavy castles.

I'm absolutely stunned for the great reviews this game has received. All the pieces are very nice and it's a pretty game to lay on the table. But that's where the fun and challenge ends.

Rosenberg extends the now-venerable farming series with a giant new entry that is possibly the largest 1-2 player only euro out there. A lovely mixture of worker placement and resource conversion with just a tiny hint of engine building, this is a fantastic game. It has some dynamic setup (although I wish there were a few extra buildings in the high-value red category so those weren't the same every time) and some static setup.

I believe I understand why Rosenberg didn't make this support 3-4 as well, but it's a little unfortunate that it does not, as it seems like a game of this depth would be highly enjoyable with 3 in addition to 2. 4... maybe not as much, but 3 would have been a wonderful addition.

Once again, the victory point system can be a bit of a let-down. You think you're doing well, that you've built great things and made good choices but when the time comes to count the victory points, you see that you've won by only a few points of actually lost the game. 
You've traded lots of things and built important buildings and your opponent has just amassed a bunch of resources and has done nothing with them and you still lost.
Personally, I find that very discouraging, illogical, and anticlimactic. It's just not that fun when you have to think more about the number of victory points you have rather than building the most developed estate. 
However, the game is very pleasant to play and very interesting. Other than the victory points, it is very well thought-out. It's very complete and there are many different things you can choose to develop (so different strategies to choose from).
I gave it a 7 because I still enjoy playing it, despite the sometimes disappointing ending.
Also, it's nice for 2 players but I really don't see the point in playing solo.

Fields of Arle is the best Uwe game I've played, and it's excellent at 1 or 2 players (although it is certainly better at two and easier to motivate myself to set it up). 

Although I haven't played Caverna and Agricola at two, it really seems the perfect format for this type of game. There is a tremendous number of options, and although you can make mistakes (and score higher after multiple playthroughs), it isn't really likely to make a mistake dehabilitating enough that you can't still have a good time. In addition, there is little downtime even multiplayer. It's like all the upside of Caverna with none of the downside.

One thing I really like about Fields of Arle is that the theme is so interwoven into the mechanics as to be pretty meticulous, and the mechanics and narrative make sense. Many of the buildings and combos are subtle, and even after many plays, I find myself reflecting back and thinking "I should've seen that!" At the same time, even if you begin the game with a coherent strategy in mind, it is very easy to find yourself wandering off to a completely other path or making new connections on the way. Planning can definitely be rewarded, but seeing new options come into your grasp makes the game feel fresh as it progresses. It's kind of amazing considering perfect information (except your opponent's plans) is available at all times.

Fields of Arle may be my favorite game of the last few years. It is definitely my favorite for two players and solo.

Updated 12/9/2017 that I think this, along with Feast for Odin are truly masterpieces. Fields of Arle is lighter in some sense, but they also have different feels. Obviously with the higher player count, you have to pick Feast, but at two, I think they are different enough to recommend both.

Though the number of choices and strategies in this game can be overwhelming at first, I now find this game relaxing. Really like that you can explore a different strategy each time, discover the interactions between the action spots, the buildings, etc., and how best to make use of them. Feels very much like a puzzle-y experience, and I love it. I'm not usually a solo gamer, but I've played this solo a few times now, and enjoyed it every time.

Subtracting a half point until I get more plays.

Ismét egy nagyszerű játék Uwe Rosenbergtől. Egyértelműen nekem ő a kedvenc játék szerzőm, szeretem az Agricolát és a Cavernát is, így nem csoda, hogy az ezekre hasonlító Fields of Arle is megfogott. Hasonló gazdálkodós játék, amelyben ismét rengeteg döntési lehetőségünk van, a győzelemhez is többféle út vezet. Az etetés elég könnyű a játékban és az állattartás is másodlagos. Így 5 játék után talán az egyik legsikeresebb taktika a ruhák gyártása (bőr, vászon, szövet) tűnik.

Sept 14: Rosenberg? 1-2 players? MUST BUY!

May 15: After two solo plays I have rated it 8.5 coz it's great but must play vs others. So much to do and explore but much more focused than Caverna. Feels like a souped up Agricola ACBAS. Love the tools and variety of strategies. Maybe not Uwe's best but his magnum opus so far.

Dec17: After 5 plays I have traded it and lowered rating to 8. Still love the game but I have a lot of WP games, a lot of farming games, and I feel the game needs goals/planning for the players.

Comments:
A game that I could describe as pleasant, enjoyable, relaxing, and friendly, while having all those terms come across as damning. Fields of Arle seems like it has a lot of good features. Multiple paths to victory, the possibility of wildly different end states, supply chokepoints and blocking, etc.

I can't help but feel it's missing something, though. Two player seems like you're always SO close to interacting with someone else, but you never seem to get there. The only way you can even block someone is by taking both the imitation space, and also the space they need. Even then, what are you really setting them back? They've lost a little bit of time, and maybe some food, but there's so many options that their plans can almost always be adjusted to something that's very close to as good as what you blocked.

I'm going to give it a few more tries. It's not a bad game by any means, and I feel like it's a great Rosenberg for the conflict averse. The quintessential "I want my partner to play a real board game but they don't like me crapping on their plans" game. That's not really what I'm looking for in a two player game, though, so I suspect it won't hold up well.

No sleeves needed.

It's a fine game, perfect - in fact - for lovers of sandbox-type of games where you can choose your own path(s) (from MANY) and follow them without major obstructions from other players and a sinister threat cast upon by the neccessity of feeding.

And that's evidently not my type of a game.  Both Ora et Labora and Caverna are not so sandbox-like as FoA and that's why I adore them while FoA didn't induce warm feelings in me.

I find following comments coming from other bgg users particularly relevant:

"I like games which have a more streamlined focus on what you are trying to do".

"FoA isn't for me, the game is too open with absolutely no stress or tension coming through in the game play except feeling like you could have scored even more points."

RATING: 7.5
The short of it is, some of both the [i]Farmers of the Moor[/i] and [i]Caverna[/i] combine with a few other elements to bring you a 2 player huge point grabbing game. The few other elements do actually give the game its own unique feel I think believe it or not. So while it is yet another WP build your tableau point grabbing convert resources to VP game, I think it is just different enough (unlike Caverna which was Gric 2.0) to warrant playing and probably buying, assuming you like the other games and want a somewhat different 2 player version. So you do have some farming actions, and you are cutting Peat, and there are an array of buildings to choose from this is all familiar. Divergence comes in how your board develops (see pics), almost no feeding stress, there are a multitude of actions here right from round 1, and many are quite different than in other games (like upgrading the different actions to get more stuff from them [and points if upgraded enough]). 

So essentially it's a [i]huge[/i] point salad (edit - but then I played Ora et L after, that is just plain looney and puts this one in perspective...) and once again a crazy amount of stuff in the box, esp for only 2. It has the aspect of Caverna where the building you really wanted can be snatched from you, but with only 2 players there should be a few others you also want so not terrible here. There is a lot of stuff to account for so a fair bit to learn to play, but after a round or two it starts flowing quite well and you start focusing on how to score points long term. It could be a touch long, but then it should speed up after a play or two hopefully to 90 mins which would be great for a game like this (easily tweakable too). 

Speaking of tweaks, why oh why not make this a 3 player? 4 is not feasible with design as is but 3 was very very possible, see my tidbit below (shame is you'll have to make components to do it now) Probably not as strategically open as Caverna, there are certain things it really looks like you NEED to do if you want a good score and if you want to score animals you are forced to herd a balanced group as Uwe adopts Knizia-type scoring for these. Vehicles and tool upgrades both seem important as well but its early at least for me to conclude any of this.  

So in sum here if you like building things like a farm in Gric but hated the stress of it, this is your game as there is almost none of that kind of stress here. 

TIDBIT - Game could have easily been 3 player, if someone is willing to fudge the components give each player 3 workers instead of 4 (so 9 vs 8 total per round, almost the same so barely tighter) and extend game to 12 rounds instead of 9 (each player gets 36 placements, exactly the same as 2 player but note game will be ~ 1/3 longer this way). Maybe one or two other small things to tweak, but that will give you a very playable 3 player, something maybe a future expansion will do and give components for.

RATING: 7
I really like the cart mechanic where you can use the spaces to either make deliveries or upgrade goods. I also really enjoy the tool tracks and how you can spend time getting more shovels or whatever to make your actions more powerful in the future. And the tracks to keep track of most types of resources is really nice and prevents some of the fiddliness of earlier games. Definitely a sandbox style game where you have way more you're able to do than you'll have time for so you have to choose what to focus on. The biggest drawback for me is that it's two player only, which I rarely have an opportunity to play.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (January 2017)

I generally love Uwe Rosenberg´s heavier designs and this game is no exception, I really like Fields of Arle as does my SO.

Fields of Arle is a medium weigh worker placement game. The game´s rules aren’t very complex but there are many of them. You can explain the game in about 30 minutes. Playtime is around 3 hours the first time but I guess it will be less with repeated plays. I´m no solo gamer so I won’t be playing the game alone, but as is usual with Rosenberg, it is a possibility and that’s a plus.

The box is heavy and full of components, it was also expensive but it is worth it. The components and art are very well done.

Fields of Arle is reminiscent of Agricola and Caverna, but it is also different, it is its own game. I prefer it to Caverna, but Agricola is still better for me.

I´m no fan of the theme, but I don’t mind the theme in most Euros, however you do feel it through the game and that´s always welcomed.

The setup can be a bit long but I don’t mind, also, you don’t always use the same buildings, so there is some replayability there. 

The game decisions are meaty and non-obvious, every turn you have about 15 to 30 options so it isn’t easy. It seems there are many paths to victory but I have only played once. There is no luck in the game so the better strategy will win. You can plan far ahead and you feel you won’t accomplish everything you want with so few workers. I love the tension.

As it plays only two players, getting it to the table can be a challenge, but that’s not a negative, I prefer to play two players games.

Bottom line, Fields of Arle is a good Euro game and a keeper in my game collection. The decisions are very interesting and there is no luck besides the setup. It can probably get an upgraded rating from me with more plays. Good stuff. 

Current Rating: 7.5

Fields of Arle is reminiscent of a number of Rosenberg's other heavy offerings.  Thematically it most resembles Agricola, and the worker placements also hearken back to that title and Caverna.  The variable setup elements also refer back to Agricola, though much more constrained than the myriad cards.  The up front complexity exceeds even that of Ora and Labora, and the big moves facilitated by deliveries are tactical possibilities straight out of Le Havre.

The victory condition is as open-ended as in any of the heavy Rosenberg titles (only Caverna can compete), and the out-of-season action mechanic and workbench mechanics are unique.

Fields of Arle may be Rosenberg's best game yet, but I'm not near understanding it well enough to be sure.  Nor will I until I've hit at least the 15-play mark.

RATING: 6.8
Too many options for 1st time player.  Unlike Caverna or Agricola which the action option/space is open each by each throughout different round, action option of Fields of Arle is open from beginning to the end, make it difficult to choose from the starting period.

More open that Uwe's previous farming games (Agricola, I'm looking at you) but no worse for it.

I really like the sandbox that Uwe has design here.  I'd say the only negative for me at this stage is the graphic design of the main action board.  It's a bit too "dry" for me.

Still, while maybe not THE best Uwe game it's up there...

Just a few solo plays so far, but really enjoying this one! It has so many options to consider and really gives my brain a workout! Not as tense as Agricola maybe, but I find it more challenging to decide what to do!

Twenty solo games in, and this game shows no signs of losing its luster.  The options here are so diverse and interesting.  Uwe Rosenberg has yet another masterpiece to his credit!

After about 30 solo games and being unable to get it played with my wife more than a couple of times, I feel like I have had my fill of Fields of Arle. I think I will probably end up trading this away because of the limited player count options. This game is amazing and deserves to be in the hands of someone who will get it played more than I have been able to lately.

After a year without Arle, I am acquiring it once again. This game is truly a masterpiece. I prefer it to all of Uwe's other games.

A heavy game. Designed for two. That is not a war game nor a territory-fueled endeavor. There are A LOT of choices here and in your first few plays it will be difficult to see a path forward. There appear to be a huge number of places to focus, which can lead to a lack of focus. However, focus you must and given the options there are many strategies to employ over many games. 

If you enjoy worker placement, if you enjoy heavy games, and you have an opponent that shares these values, then this is a game you must have. It is as simple as that. At the Gates is a good game for two, but it does not have the number of different approaches that this game offers. I am a huge Rosenberg fan and each of his games is different enough from the others for me to hold on to all of the ones that I have played, at least. (Ora et Labora, Caverna, Glass Road and Merkator are as yet unplayed...)

[b]Options and depth[/b]
The game presents you with many options! There are a few things that you will use to varying degrees in most games, but there are some that you will only use if you pursue certain strategies. There are many little tracks that make certain actions better. It's expensive to move up these tracks, in a given game you probably won't improve more than two or three of them.

There are buildings to build as well. You use a subset of all available buildings in a game. The available buildings help shape possible strategies as synergies will exist between them and the actions. 

All of these options create an amazing, varied, and deep gaming experience for experienced players. For the non-initiated it can be a bit overwhelming. The game demands repeated plays to play properly and to fully understand the layered decision making. This is typical of Uwe's heavier games. 

[b]Your loss is my gain[/b]
This is a 2p game so the zero sum math engine can be used to full effect. The action selection is blocking so you are often taking your opponent's desires into account when you choose actions. You have to weigh what you want to accomplish against the gains from blocking them. There is enough flexibility that you cannot usually completely deny someone the ability to do something, but you can make it difficult.

Carving out a niche for yourself that makes some actions more attractive to you is important. However, there will always be conflict over certain actions and you have to plan carefully to make sure you can accomplish your goals. 


I really enjoyed my play of this. There are heaps of difficult decisions to make. If I had any need for crunchy 2p games I would pick this up. For my purposes [thing=35677]Le Havre[/thing] and [thing=31260]Agricola[/thing] provide similar gaming experiences and have a much better chance of seeing the table.

Clearly Rosenberg with many resources, many actions, many conversion possibilities. So many, that he deemed it to be feasible for two players only this time. It doesn't have the scarcity known from Agricola, the challenge is to focus and select the right ones from the multitude of options.

My first question was whether I need this when I can play all other Rosenberg's with two as well without losing much. The thoughtful details might be a reason and the differing experience of abundance instead of scarcity. After one play, still not decided which is not that bad considering that I easily decided against owning Caverna due to Agricola existing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I sadly can't rate this beyond my love for Uwe's games because my husband is not a "build your farm", as he would say, style of player.  But I own it out of the pure anticipation of being able to find a like minded person to play it with that will love building their farm and shipping goods as much as I do.  I might just play the solo variant and see what the highest score I can obtain is.  It would be fun to have a forum of solo players to compete against. HUMM???

An enjoyable two player game. The setup is a little cumbersome and the play time is a little longer than I would like. But I appreciate the attention to detail in the theme. I'm just not sure if I would always prefer this to just playing 2 player Agricola though.

1 play impression. Good game, primarily about goods conversion. I find it on the abstract side with the theme/art leaving a little to be desired - it doesn't feel like you're "building" anything, as with Agricola/Caverna. It feels more like putting together the pieces of a puzzle. 2-player solitaire with almost no player interaction. There isn't even contention for worker spots with so many choices. That said, it still feels fresh and the vehicles are interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.9
Absolutely blew my mind on my first play. Since I'm a sucker for Rosenberg fans this was to be expected, I guess but really. Sooooo many decisions to be made and completely different strategies to follow. I'm not quite sure how long it can hold it's own if you play it really really often e.g. if there is one perfect way to victory that you can follow that is hard to counter for the other player but until then ... amazing game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I just didn't enjoy it. Better than Agricola, but we were both bored about half-way through our first game. The wife got tired of learning and learning and learning. And I wasn't too excited. The game will benefit from LOTS of repeated plays, and with all my games, I just can't find a spot for this one. Too bad, as there is a lot to like here, and we are not afraid of a big game, but this one just bored us.

This is an impressive synthesis of Rosenberg's resource conversion games. One can see the hallmarks of his previous games all over this. Given that I'm an Uwe fan, that's a good thing. Although I theoretically would love to play this with more than two people, I think the down time would be intolerable. The breadth of choices of actions and paths to victory is quite staggering. This is Rosenberg-flavoured points salad.

Another Uwe farming game and this one is really good.  It definitely plays quickly.  One of the most satisfying features of the game is that everything in play, from the player actions to the available buildings, are all easily readable to both players thus avoiding the one frustrating feature of many of Rosenberg's games (Glass Road, Caverna, etc.).  Fields of Arle pushes it's way into the line while knocking Caverna down a notch.

RATING: 9
Very nice theme, Uwe Rosenbergs home land. Satisfying experience to play as well, as the farm is growing really nice. You need to be aware of the impact of the buildings though and how trading with carts is beneficial on so many fronts. That might take a while.

Regarding balance, it seems that farming is not that good in comparison to livestock. 

But overall this is one of the best 1 and 2 player experiences I ever played. Highly recommended worker placement game for couples and solo gamers.

I'm so glad Uwe made this because at one level it's not a board game at all, but a self-immersive narrative about being a Fresian farmer - terrific for drifting off on a rainy Saturday afternoon into an alternative bygone rural idyll. It plays like a precursor to Feast For Odin or an adult version of All Creatures Big & Small. All three are core games in my collection. Absolutely wonderful.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I'm not sure what I would compare this game to in Rosenberg's batch of games.  It is quite a puzzle as you work through your many choices (It can be overwhelming and AP players could struggle the first few games).  I expect there are numerous paths towards victory and hope to explore this one more.  Replayability is maintained to some degree by some random mix of buildings in the game.  Don't try to do everything - pick a couple things and focus on doing those well.  However, animals do require maintaining some balance as the scoring there is a bit Knizia as you score 0 points for each animal you have the most of, 1 point for each animal you have the second most, and 2 points for each animal you have the least of.  Horses can be tricky to build up as transportation is key in this game  for upgrades and the good transportation tiles require the "sacrifice" of 1-2 horses.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very good worker placement resource management game.  It is very reminiscent of Agricola with far less tension regarding feeding and preventing negative points.  I found myself wondering if I needed to own another "Harvest" style worker placement Euro but it is quite well done as usual.

Quite possible Uwe Rosenburg's masterpiece, Fields of Arle combines ideas from many of his games (including LeHavre and Agricola) while adding new, fresh ideas, to make one huge offering to the "euro-style" economy genre.  The components quality/design are a cut above, and the game is lavished in little details.  FoA showers players in possibilities (without enough time to do everything), and numerous paths to victory.  Playing give the feeling of freedom and abundance that even LeHavre never reached.

This might be the definitive 2-player economic euro game, if not game.

It takes a while to setup, but not much more than some of his previous games.

Amazing game. I played it quite a bit already and it still occupies my mind, and to be honest I had doubts given the setup is almost completely static and there is no randomness to speak of. Fortunately, even in solo play there are enough moving parts that the game keeps being fun. I find it quite a soothing experience in which one can relax and develop a nice farm, then check to see how the approach worked in terms of victory points.

One thing for solo players to note is that the game doesn't really have anything for solo play except a score to try and go for, and to be honest I think one has to approach this game differently than many others so if you're a "play to win" person than it might not feel as exciting to you, though I admit I mostly thought I am this kind of player and yet here I am loving this game :)

RATING: 6
The sandbox nature of the game and the point salad flavouring of it leave me kind of cold.  There's no strong narrative to the game.  Most of it's just incremental accumulation of goods (and points).  Occasionally, for example, when one builds a high VP building, there's a little "hooray" moment.  In addition, it's a lot of two-player solitaire.  Even if I'm blocked out of what I want, there's usually another way to get it or there's a completely different action that's worth taking.  So it lacks the tension of some other Uwe games (like [b][thing=31260][/thing][/b]) where someone taking the action you wanted can really mess you up.  [b][thing=159675][/thing][/b] is a cleaner, more streamlined game (with more options), but I think I prefer Uwe's older games.

Purge says re buying: Yes, this is a fantastic two player game, but it is very deep. This is a heavy game and for gamers only. If you are a fan of Agricola/Caverna, then this game is going to appeal to you. I would stay away playing this game with new gamers or people who have not progressed past Ticket to Ride. This is a great experience and I would recommend it even if you have Agricola/Caverna. Excellent game.

This game is really fun if you are looking for a heavy-ish two player game.  It definitely scratches the Rosenberg itch that I sometimes have.  I still prefer Feast for Odin at two players, or Le Havre, but this is good to mix it up once in a while.  My wife didn't hate it, which is a plus.

Fields of Arle is quite fun, but plays on the long side and may be Uwe's most complex farming/harvesting game yet. I'm not sure that's a good thing.

After four games, I know that I'm just scratching the surface of this game.  But so far, I do enjoy the theme - especially the dike building, but I wish there was more incentive to do so. I like the vehicles and trade with towns, but the buildings, though a few have powerful end points, overall feel underwhelming. I would love to see more interesting/relevant buildings for this game. So, this is a good solid game, which doesn't quite have the pizazz of Caverna, but a welcome addition to my collection nonetheless. 

Edit:  after seven games, I've found that there is a clear (and ultimately quite disappointing) route to victory.  Dike building, the theme that I found most interesting in the game, is actually irrelevant, the beginning buildings are also mostly irrelevant, and the end buildings are hugely overpowered.  Sadly I will not be keeping this in my collection.

Initial rating: 8.  

Field Knight?  The apotheosis of harvesting?  Where are all my variable powers, though (Agricola cards).  Less buildings than Caverna on full.  But all actions all at once.  No progressive revelation of new actions.  

Owing to time, my first 2er left us overwhelmed.  I finished my first solo in good time and got a better feel for the thing.

---

Update a year later.  So many plays unrecorded, Fields of Arle is a preferred heavy solo.  Slight economics, variable set up, and cubes to push make this my favorite farming spreadsheet.

It's a monster! The rules are long, the game is massive and the decisions are plentiful! I really enjoyed my first play. It's one of those games that you have to write off your first play. By the third round, you start to really see how the game works, and by the end of the game, it all makes sense. We shortened the game by 2 rounds, otherwise it would have been well over 2 hours. There's going to be some AP based on the vast amount of worker placement spots available. However, it doesn't bog down, and it's fun to play. This is my second Rosenberg (after Agricola) and this one is greatly improved! A keeper!

FUN: there are many different paths to explore.

UNIQUE: there's nothing unique about this game if you have played Agricola, Le Havre, etc.

NEGATIVES: the definition of multiplayer solitaire. Even when someone blocks the space you want, there are still many other things you could do that are almost as good. Unfortunately, this means the game has almost no real tense moments. Also, you are getting free stuff left and right in this game. This kind of diminishes the feeling that your farm accomplishes something special.

Game sandbox cực kỳ, Mục tiêu của game là làm cho người chơi xây dựng được nguyên một ngôi làng rộng lớn và phát triển không giới hạn. Tài nguyên trong game ko bị limit bởi component, có thể xây vài cái lâu đài trong làng và đất đai của làng có thể mở rộng ra gấp bốn lần so với ban đầu game bằng cách xây đê lấn biển hoặc làm ngập đồng hoang để cải tạo đất và sau đó đào bùn để lấy thêm đất xây dựng cũng như trồng trọt chăn nuôi. Hầu như không có chuyện ép người chơi phải chật vật nuôi ăn, thức ăn trong game giống như là tiền trong các game khác, rất dễ kiếm và còn dùng để làm các action đặc biệt.

Game có 9 vòng, mỗi vòng người chơi có 4 turn tương ứng với nửa năm, tổng cộng game có 30 hành động để chọn. Vòng lẻ và chẵn trong game đại diện cho mùa hè và mùa đông, mỗi mùa có 15 hành động khác nhau để làm. Người đi đầu nửa năm tiếp theo có thể bỏ quyền đi đầu nửa năm đó để có 1 lần dùng 15 hành động của mùa khác để sử dụng.

Toàn bộ 30 hành động của người chơi được thiết kế thông minh và có sự cân bằng cũng như ràng buộc và phụ thuộc lẫn nhau giữa hai mùa, thể hiện tốt việc làm nông, xây dựng qua các mùa và đều tương tác trực tiếp tới điểm, ko có hành động nào ko dẫn tới việc tăng điểm vào cuối game. Game ko có score track và có rất nhiều đường kiếm điểm nhưng board của game và token đều thiết kế để người chơi có thể dễ dàng tính được tổng số điểm hiện có của mình.

Vấn đề của game là do quá sandbox, với ~10 loại tài nguyên cần quản lý, ~20 random building, ~10 địa điểm du lịch được bầy sẵn cũng như 8 loại xe cộ & tàu có thể chế tạo để đi du lịch và giúp ích cho việc mua bán trao đổi hàng hóa nông trại. Bởi vì các vấn đề đó tương ứng với sự ràng buộc phức tạp của các action trong game cho nên ngay lần chơi đầu tiên phải trải qua 1-2 năm đầu tiên người chơi mới có khả năng định hình việc mình cần làm và cần phải chơi ít nhất 2-3 game mới có thể thực sự có được chiến lượt rõ ràng khi chơi. 

Đánh giá chung là game bắt buộc phải có của fan dòng xây dựng và nông trại, và nhất là fan của Uwe. Game ko phải là ko thiết kế được cho nhiều người chơi như Caverna, nhưng với thời gian chơi tăng 1h cho mỗi người thì design cho 2 người như vậy là quá đẹp, vừa đủ thời gian chơi khiến không mệt mỏi mà vẫn giữ được cảm giác sung sướng khi nhìn ngôi làng của mình lúc kết thúc game.

Decent enough game.  Lots of actions to choose from and you want to do everything but can only do most things.  In the end, you come close to doing everything anyway: it does not look like there are lots of different paths to explore which is a bit disappointing.  The cow meeples are funnt.

Weird niche game. Heavy on the rules, long and only for two player. I feel forced into a 'do a little bit of everything' strategy. Every game sort of feels the sams to me with minor differences. Nearly no interaction. This still is a basic worker placement in the end with too little real strategic possibilities. Total letdown. Play the two player agricola instead. Much better in a smaller amount of time. Sold it.

While Fields of Arle lacks the tightness and tension of Agricola, it provides a wonderful open-ended challenge with a vast decision space. In some ways I find playing FoA to be a relaxing and almost contemplative experience (especially since I've mostly played this solo). This is definitely among Rosenberg's finest games.

There is quite a bit going on in this game, and it definitely has Uwe's fingerprints all over it.  I could see my score for this going up or down based on subsequent plays.  I had a hard time internalizing all of the various resource types and the actions necessary to convert them.  I also felt I wasn't optimizing my actions very much, as I wasn't even close to filling up my player board.  This might be a very interesting solo game with a lot of depth.  And there are just shy of a billion bits included with this game.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is the ultimate two player synthesis of Rosenberg's resource conversion games. The various conversion paths are very interesting and provide much leeway for the players. You have to play the game frequently and often to take full advantage of its depth. There's a lot of setup involved so the time commitment prevents us from getting this to the table as frequently as we like. It's not a casual game experience so our knowledge of the rules atrophies if we don't play it consistently. But if you have time for the full immersion, it's totally worth the effort.

Spel 2016

This game shares a lot of elements from other Rosenberg's games, the farming theme, the animals, the need for food (Agricola), the uncovering of peat fields (Glass Road), the covering of negative points (Odin) etc. The game is more of a sandbox experience with all available options laid out right from the beginning - in line with Caverna but to a lesser extent. I don't like it as much as Odin for now though where it's more clear what you need to do from the beginning, trying to cover up as many negative points as you could, but I like it more than Caverna where the sandbox is too big to explore. I only played it solo for now, would like to try out some strategies and rating might go up after repeated plays. The game is together with Glass Road one of his most thematical games though where the cities that you visit are real places.

For now, my list of Rosenberg's harvest series of games in order of how much I like them:

Odin 9.5 >> Agricola 9 >> Fields of Arle / Glass Road 8.5 >> Agricoa 2P / Le Havre 8 >> Caverna 7 >> Gates of Loyang 6.5

This could be Uwe Rosenberg's best solo game, and a strong contender as his best 2-player game. Arle's sandbox approach to worker placement does what Caverna couldn't - keep the wide open decision space engaging without feeling overwhelming. It's also incredibly thematic, bringing to life this somewhat autobiographical story.

A solid, non-aggressive two player game.. Lots of choice on what to aim for/ direction to take.. Amazing if you like to build stuff and look at what you have created without ruining the other persons plan.. Maybe a little too open ended as you can get whatever you want whenever you want, as there are several ways of getting what you need.. 

I have played this with both the solo and 2 player variant and it works well with both.. The only thing i long for now is an expansion so i can experience it with more people.. 

This game is such a beast in setup and often play time, it dosent hit the table as much as i wished it did :/

My wife & I like Le Havre, although we don't play it too often just due to the length of the game. We both like Agricola less -- I think it's fine (but not great), while she's lukewarm at best. Mostly we don't like how stressful the game is. The farming theme is nice, though, so when I saw Fields of Arle retained the farming theme, is supposed to be much less stressful, and it's designed for two players, I knew we needed to give it a shot.

Well, it's a really great game. The farming theme really comes through, and it is indeed much less stressful (both feeding your family and the competition for worker placement locations). But wow, is it heavy! There are so many options and it seems like there are a large number of strategies to pursue. Of course, that's a big part of what makes it a great game! On the other hand, all of those options meant the game took quite awhile to play (2.5 hours) and my brain was pretty tired by the end.

While I'd love to play it more often, it's difficult just due to the length of the game.

As "couple gamers" my wife and I quite often have to cope with the sub-par mechanisms found in some of the most wonderful, epic games that so often treat us as second class citizens -- as an afterthought.

Fields of Arle is a wonderful addition to our collection for the very reason that it's a two player (or solo) game. Everything is designed with this in mind.

I love the huge amount of freedom you have to play how you like and still come out a winner.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
My rating is purely based on solo play. Since I rated this a 9, do I *always* want to play this game? No. I'm basing that rating on what Uwe has accomplished with this game. I view it as an historical meditation, of sorts. Many games require conflict and a sense of competition. When that is ported over to historical games, the natural inclination is to simulate / target warfare. I love wargaming, and I love games that have direct conflict and area control as mechanics. 

What I love about Fields of Arle, though, is how Uwe has sought to capture the activities that make up the majority of historical life for the majority of humanity...day-to-day economic decisions.  I say "sought to capture" because we're at a pretty high level of abstraction, and I wonder if for most individuals there has ever really been the sense of iterative progress that Uwe games seem to always provide. The games provide a very hopeful read on history -- with careful planning and allocation of effort, learning a craft, and trading with others, life can be improved.

I think that whether accurately capturing historical reality in terms of behavior, that attitude or hope *does* capture normative reality for most individuals across history. Battles happen, but historically they are brief eruptions between planting crops. The aspirational reality is one of hoped for improvement, of plans for improvement, of community.

Anyway, Fields of Arle is in a sense a typical Uwe game: worker placement, resource exchange, etc. But the presentation in this game is so, so clean. The rulebook is about as clear as any I've read. The board contains almost all of the in-game information you'll need.  The problem space is rich. The components are very high quality. Quite an achievement.

Received in a trade (6/1/15)

[COLOR=#FF0000]UPDATE:[/color]

[i]Still not sure about Arle, but I definitely rushed it out the door. The more games I play the more I've realized ow much I enjoy Uwe's designs. I've also started playing more solo games and I think Arle would be a good one.

I just got to play again and thoroughly enjoyed it. I'll definitely be updating my thoughts/rating on FoA soon. [/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]FoA isn't for me, the game is too open with absolutely no stress or tension coming through in the game play except feeling like you could have scored even more points. I actually enjoy the tension caused by having to feed your people in Agricola and Le Havre or keeping customers happy in Loyang. Fields has none of that, it actually feels more open than Caverna (another Uwe design that has left my collection). I'm perfectly content playing the older Uwe designs since he seems to be creating more open ended, less punishing games with the notable exception of Patchwork which I love). 

I also like the variety introduced in games like Agricola, Loyang and Glass Road because of the variety of different cards/building tiles you see each game. These force you to constantly develop new strategies instead of optimizing the same group of actions/tiles that are always available each game (as in Caverna and FoA). I can absolutely understand how some people love these newer designs and it's great that these games are available to play, they're just not for me. That said, I'd still happily play FoA or Caverna with someone who loved those games.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8/10):[/COLOR]

[i]- A wide open Uwe game that still leaves you feeling that you could have accomplished more and been more efficient.
- A staggering amount of ways to build your engine/score points and they each feel unique.
- Surprisingly easy to get into even though there are so many paths open to you in the beginning of the game, it opens up quite naturally and thematically makes sense.
- I really appreciate the autobiographical perspective this game offers. I always enjoy playing games that have ties to history, even if it is a personal view of of a time/place (this feels like one of Uwe's more thematic games).
- Typical amazing Lookout bits/production, with beautiful artwork by Dennis Lohausen. 
- As much as I have enjoyed my initial plays of FoA it still doesn't come close to surpassing Agricola for me.[/i]

It's really just the Agricola / Caverna / Le Havre type experience with a different set of buildings and options, building an engine to maximise your points. Which isn't a bad thing because this is a solid and enjoyable genre, especially if you haven't played those to death, but it's not exactly ground-breaking either. With only two players, there's less interference in your plans, especially if you head off along different exploration paths in a game. As a result, it worries me that there's so little luck or inter-game differentiation, that there's an ideal approach to the game. But in the meantime, there are so many paths to explore before you get to that point that I'll no doubt get value for the money and much replay - especially given I have a dedicated opponent who also enjoys the game. And having that is the key.

To me this looks significantly better than Agricola. Components are great, rules are well structured, it's not as hard to figure out on first play as it looks. 

After a few more plays, I really like this game and am looking forward to playing again. As players replay this game, they can both find their own ways of working out their strategies. Whilst at first options seem plentiful, they really aren't and soon players will take away opportunities. Also the 9 rounds aren't really that long so decisions become more and more important with every play. 

It's just really quite amazing how many possibilities players got. I tried travelling, focusing on trade goods, focusing on animals... I think I'm still just scratching the surface and that there is more and more to do.

Once I realised the potential extra actions the cheaper houses provide, it opened up a few new doors on how to maximise a few things.

Brilliant game. A keeper and repeater.

There is so much going on here, it is hard to know where to start. It is a two-player sandbox game where you can do whatever you want to do but that may or may not lead you to victory. For me, this is a game where the gaming experience and choosing from thousands of decisions during the game is half the fun. Now fans of Agricola and La Havre will argue otherwise but as someone who is a fan of Phil Eklund's games, sandbox games are quite enjoyable. 

This is one that I will keep and enjoy playing for years. As a bonus, it is probably the best solitaire Rosenberg game I have come across.

RATING: 5
First 2 games it seemed like a winner, as you try to figure out all the actions. This newness and discovery quickly grew stale after the third play and solving the game. Okay, I finally got a good score. Now what? Lost all desire to play it again. Long set up,  repetitive actions, visually bland design, no tension, buildings not balanced, and it's a solitaire puzzle, even with two. Even worse, it's dull work, like farming. You really need to enjoy the theme of farming to get into this. I have never fantasized about farming or menial labor. Maybe because I've worked on actual farms.

 Played solo and got depressed. Yay! I beat my previous score. Who cares? I am really not interested in beating my previous score. Is this a reason to release a game? Atari did that in 1978, and it was boring then, too. This might be better as a 99 cent app, not a $70 game. Rosenberg is hit and miss. Big box, overwrought, chit punching, stickering beasts like this, followed by wisps of non game fluff like patchwork. He can't get it right on either end. Only the middle weight games like glass road and gates of loyang work for me, and I sold them too after a couple plays. Most overrated designer of the last ten years.

This 2-player gamers game just works great. The only issue I have with the game is the setup time. This is a lot of work and preparing.

This is a game for players who alreay know Agricola or Caverna, because this is just one step up in number of rules to memorise.

I think Uwe closes the circle with this one. His personal background explains all the farming "obsession" that lead to all this continuous farming games. This one, for me, has the theme quite adapted to the mechanics. It´s another step forward and an excellent medium/heavy game for 2 players.
Though, as I stated above, for me, the farming stops here, the circle is closed.

Fields of Arle is a 2-player-only game in the same vein as Rosenberg’s other worker-placement farming games, Agricola and Caverna. Here, there are two distinct groups of actions spaces that can be taken--one representing summer, the other winter. You can do one thing “out of season”, but it costs you turn order. Additionally, the action spaces often had a “tools track” associated with them--the higher you are on a tools track, the better the action will be. In addition to the usual fields (which don’t need to be sown) and animals, you can also acquire buildings, which usually provide points and a one-time benefit but take up space, and vehicles. The vehicles allow you to either transport your wood/clay to upgrade them to lumber/bricks, or visit nearby towns to sell your goods for tons of food. On the whole, this game maintains the feel of a Rosenberg farming game, but seems to have a lot more going on (which is probably why it doesn’t play more than two).

It's like it took Ora et Labora and Agricola ACBAS, mashed it together and gave you about a million different ways to score points. The game has very little tension. You're almost always fine for food and peat and you're strictly looking for the most optimal point action. You want to do literally everything, but only have 4 actions each round. It's not my favorite of his farming games as I enjoy Ora or Agricola more, but it's my favorite 2 player one as I think it plays better at that count than any of his other titles.

As for solo - Quite impressed how well it played and how many damn options I have each turn. You really want to do everything and all the options are good. I'm sure there is an optimal strategy in there somewhere, but with a randomization of buildings, it will likely take a long while before it's "solved".

Very good heavy two player game, with a lot of different actions and a lot of possible strategies. Only downside is the setup time and that's it's susceptible to analysis paralysis. The solo game is fun as well, but feels more like a huge complex puzzle than a game.

Great two player and solo game. I think I prefer Uwe's games with fewer choices at any given time, but more emergent game play or expanding game space.  This has most options available from the get-go.  That also makes it a bit harder to get into the game with new players.  Still, this is great and preferred to many games.

As I like most of Uwe Rosenberg's games a lot I had some (too?) high expectations of this one. Don't have the feeling those are quite met after 1 play. You certainly have a lot of options, that's for sure. And in our 1 play we went for different things and scores were quite close, so that's very good. My highest concern is the replayability. Ok, the buildings can be different each time, but I'm wondering of that's enough as the set-up is predetermined and you could stick to that same engine each game.

Humongous farming sandbox euro. Tons of components, table space. 
Uwe Rosenberg creation (Agricola, Caverna, etc), sandbox style (tons of  options) worker placement, farming point salad (Stephen Feld-ish).

Still on the fence about sandbox games: Wide open options are intriguing and keep repeated plays fresh. But can be AP prone and feel overwhelming; feel like you're drifting/aimless for a while, lower interaction/solitaire feel. Usually a progression of tasks/upgrades that is not always obvious. However its a lot of fun to learn and puzzle out the various paths over several plays. But can you get someone who the game doesn't instantly appeal to dedicate several plays to warm up to it?

RATING: 10
A fantastic sandbox game - so many things to do, so many different directions. Great, great solo game.
So far the only minor problem I have is that the last couple of seasons can fall a bit flat: After first working hard(ish) to build up something and frequently wishing you had just one or two extra actions each season, everything is then going pretty well and it's more or less down to just figuring out how to score the most points with the number of actions remaining. 
I still enjoy it immensely, but have to work on my mental approach to the game every time the end game is nearing - try to stay with the theme and just continue farming, making clothes, taking things to nearby towns etc.

Aki Rosenberg játékait szereti, úgy ezt is fogja. Nem tudom, hogy van-e annyi egyediség benne, mint amennyit vártam. Valahol ugyanazokkal a dilemmákkal operál, amikkel az összes játékában, de ettől függetlenül mégsem mondom, hogy ugyanaz mind. 
A játékainál már korábban feltűnt, hogy gyakorlatilag ugyanannak kellene lenniük, de mindig varázsol bele valami kis aprónak tűnő csavart amitől a játék közben érzett élmény más lesz. itt is megvan ez.
Mivel kétszemélyes így kicsit szeretném tőle azt, hogy kicsit kivesézzük, kimaxoljuk a lehetőségeit. Igyekszem más taktikákkal nyerni benne majd, nyilván ha megy.
Update: egymás után két játékban teljesen eltérő stratégiát választottam, nyertem. Szóval ki van ez találva. Elsőként a mezőgazdaságot toltam fel, másodszorra a ruhagyártás volt a kifizetődő. Szuper volt, na. :D

Survive the first game and you are going to love this game. The variety of actions is overwhelming. Always in lack of more actions. Your own town is growing steadily. The only reason why I can not give 10 points is, because it could become "boring" as you could always use the same starting tactics... (compare Le Havre).
edit: Fields of Arle becomes even better with the new expansion Tee&Trade (similarly to Agricola). Such a great game!

Typical Rosenberg game, in which there are rather little constraints in what to do. Just decide to raise cattle, make bread or produce clothing and have fun. But there is also not much of competition either and the blocking aspect is less than in other worker-placement games. However, I would play without the building which gives you free tech-advancement, which I suspect to be overpowered.

Jan. 2015:  10 plays in (6 or 7 were solo) and I really like it.  I need a buddy who wants to play it a second or even third time so we can see it when it hums.  Very cool game that I was super-pumped for heading into its release.  Solo takes 60min.  2-player takes 120min.  And a teaching 2-player probably takes close to 3 hours.

Oh. OK. I admittedly was a little afraid of this game because of a trying game of Feast for Odin, but it was all for not. This game is much more friendly to get started with. Even my first game has me with a decent handle on what to do in the game. There's still a lot to take in and will take a play or two to really get a grasp of the concepts and combos that are available. Not sure where I rank this with the others it can be compared to. I can't say I'm dying to get it to the table again, but probably wouldn't turn down a request either.

I held off on picking this one up as I own and love Agricola, Le Havre, A Feast for Odin, Glass Road, etc. Yes, it's yet another grand Rosenberg worker placement, but with enough new ideas and tweaked mechanisms to make it worth adding to the collection. Definitely has a sandbox feel of endless paths to victory just like A Feast for Odin, but with different paths. Where Feast has you chasing plunder and upgrading goods, Fields has you pondering which resources to focus on gathering to build buildings that give you the edge in victory points. My wife and I played this game 4 times in a row over the course of a few weeks which is a rarity. Lots to explore here. It will take a lot of plays before it gets stale. Uwe continues to amaze and entertain.

RATING: 6
It's not all that bad if you're an Uwe fan. The tools upgrade mechanics is an interesting addition to his standard worker placement/processing raw materials system, and FoA tries to integrate a lot of theme very specific to Uwe's rural childhood.  But there's just not much fun factor.  Strategy is lot more open-ended, less goal-oriented, at least for new players (no need for a specific food-production systems or making babies for more actions), and without cards (just a variety of buildings to choose from like Caverna), the replay value is solely based on trying to improve on your previous score (solo or 2p).  I got bored of Agricola solo pretty quickly, so I'm not sure if this type of game fits me for solo, but for 2p I personally would always choose Agricola or ACB&S.

Another Rosenberg game I had been dying to play. I have a similar feeling to this one that I had to Ora et Labora. I recognize that it's an awesome game, but I was left feeling a little cold on it. I don't even really know why. I think there was almost TOO many choices, that I had a tough time reigning in a strategy. I just kind of did a lot of things and they happened to work out. I really want to try this one again to see if I like it better the second time.

Played once. Fields of Arle follows the tried-and-tested Rosenberg big box formula™, which features an expansive resource network where resources can be upgraded, reproduced, or otherwise converted into more resources. What is worth noting are the tweaks to the formula – the efficiency of actions can be upgraded, and the two sets of actions alternate between rounds. These add a sufficiently interesting wrinkle when considering how to chain actions together.

Other aspects of the Rosenberg formula are present, but the degree of their relevance is more suited to my tastes. The mandatory payments are not quite as constraining, and while there are plenty of actions to process, they are visible from the very beginning on a centralised board. (This is in contrast to [thing=35677][/thing] and [thing=70149][/thing], where actions are scattered across the table and future actions hidden in plain sight.)

These tweaks result in the game feeling a lot more open than usual, which isn't really a big deal for me. Players can certainly choose different paths to focus on, but the required actions do overlap eventually. The overall impression is that the game is relatively pleasant, with occasional bursts of brain power needed to visualise a potential chain of actions. It's not exactly ground-breaking stuff, but solid and interesting enough to warrant further plays down the road.

Excellent. Removes nearly everything that ever was problematic for me with other Rosenberg games and adds a theme I really like.
Extremely tight but more Caverna than Agricola.

In the two player game, there is a slight chance that one player might annoy the other by taking quite long to analyse a given situation. This can be made a bit better by thinking aloud. In the solo game, that is no problem (obviously.)

I agree with the opinions of many here: the game is OK, but where is the tension? I love all the bits here and the variety of ways to score points, but ultimately, I felt like we were both playing solitaire and the game had a very relaxed feel to it. I'd much rather play Agricola over this.

UPDATE: On a second play, I found it more enjoyable and a bit more tense, as I had a better idea of what to plan for. Nevertheless, I still don't think there's a ton super new in this title.

An amazingly clever game that opens up the Agricola gameplay concept. Multiple winning strategies are possible with up to 16 possible actions for every worker. Tension is minimal since blocking is easily  worked around and that's what makes this shine for us as a two player game.

1 play, 2er

There are a LOT of cardboard bits in this game -- setup alone will take some time! It took us more than an hour to set up, then work our way through the rules. Then, another 2.5 hours (almost) to actually play the game! But actually, the game rules are not all that complex: alternate taking placing workers to take actions, clearly marked on the board, for each half of the year. Then, do some maintenance. After 4.5 years (9 rounds), calculate final scores in an almost Feldian way, i.e., based on a wide variety of things you could have done during the game. The complexity comes from trying to figure out which path to take, and reacting to your opponent's actions. The paths include expanding your farm (in a new way, different from Agricola), acquiring and upgrading goods (similar to Le Havre but with now you may be putting together sets of improved goods), selling items to different cities (also via a new mechanism), build buildings (for in-game benefits and/or end-game VP), etc. Almost everything you do is worth _some_ VP -- you just have to choose the best combination.

So, an interesting, heavy game with straightforward rules but complex game play, partially because of the wide open game play: there are almost too many options available, right from the start of the game. With absolutely no randomness, this seems to be more like a puzzle than a game: a complex machine to figure out and put away. I guess that's why it's a good game for 1, too. I'd like to play it more, I guess, if only to figure the game out. But I'm not particularly excited about the prospect, and I doubt it will be a long-term favorite.

Uwe Rosenberg's two-player only farming effort does not disappoint as a huge fan of Uwe's games.  That's not to say I enjoy every one of his efforts,  I dislike Bohnanza and didn't find At the Gates of Loyang very enjoyable but I'd still put the man at about an 80% success rate in my eyes and that's because the man knows how to design rich, elegant games.

I chose the word "rich" over "complicated" because his games are often dense and varied in their options but I never find them inaccessible or daunting.  This one is no different.  One might be initially dissuaded by the sheer amount of cardboard on the table after setup but everything works in a very elegant and balanced package.

Each turn players place one of their four workers on the available spaces for alternating half-years.  These do a huge variety of things from collecting one of 3 different types of animals to delivering goods to foreign cities for food to make it through the changing of the rounds.  Some of Uwe's games can feel stressful, I will admit, especially when it comes to the ever-prevalent need to feed your family which makes another appearance here but I promise you, you will never be short on food in this game.  There are so many ways to make food and in such large quantities that the four food you need at every changing of the round will be readily available.

I love games that present a lot of options which puts Uwe and Feld at the top of my favorite designers lists.  You have so many different options in this game to make such a diverse and bustling homestead for points in several different areas that you just become engrossed in it. There is a bit of player interaction with the worker placement mechanic allowing you to block off spaces from your opponent but this is never anything too painful.  There is even an imitation space you can use to take an occupied action for the price of food, which again is plentiful.

One might wonder at the need for this game when so many of his other farming-themed games work well with two such as Agricola and Caverna but this is just too good not to recommend.

A good game with several paths to victory. It failed to really make me crave for another game though. Maybe no game with such a VP salad do. I guess my issue was that it feels like two players are playing in parallel, each doing his own little and hoping it will result in more VP than the other player, only measuring when blocking an action can be better than taking the one you might really want. I recognize the greatness of Uwe's game, even if they don't make me dream. This one was great, but I do think Le Havre and Patchwork are better.

Surprisingly enjoyable farm-life simulator, both solo and as a two-player game. I'm not generally a fan of "beat your high-score" solo games, but then I'm not entirely certain that the score is the point of this one. 

Often called a sand box game, for good reason. I enjoy picking a metaphorical lever to pull and seeing what happens. A high score seems to require an odd balance of keeping your focus while dabbling in diverse point systems to fill in the gaps. Dabble too much, and you don't score much anywhere. Don't dabble enough and you seem to leave points behind due to inefficiencies.

This one may were itself out over time, but for now it's an enjoyable and surprisingly restful experience.

Oh, and did I mention, LOTS of rules.  Plus lots of questions about the rules as we went along... but with intermittent help from a couple of people who'd played it before, I think we got most of the questions answered and we got through the game.  I wouldn't expect anybody who doesn't basically like the Agricola/Caverna system to like this.  But we do, and we did.

I liked this game, but it felt like it was missing something for me from playing Agricola and Caverna.  I've never played either game with 2, but it's possible the mechanics of these games with 2 just aren't as appealing to me, and the them does nothing for me.  I certainly enjoyed myself, and I'd play again, but at this point I'll stick with Caverna.

Upon getting started (solo), I had no clue what to do... but as the turns progressed, things started to fall into place. This is a leap-of-faith game where you just have to sit down and play to allow the design to reveal itself.

Quite fascinating, and enjoyable.

Fields of Arle is a worker placement game from Uwe Rosenberg, which means it traces its descent from Agricola and Caverna while also inheriting some elements from Ora et Labora and Glass Road. It continues the trend in Uwe's recent games of being decreasingly less competitive and being more of a point salad. Fields of Arle is nothing more than just another low-interaction optimization exercise. 

There is almost no tension to Fields of Arle: food requirements are barely a concern, and the number of possible action spaces is high enough (and the quality of those spaces comparable enough) that it barely matters what your opponent does; Arle has accepted and embraced the accusation of being a multi-player solitaire game. 

What remains is a little puzzle for players to figure out which of the many, many, different paths to victory will give out the most points. Is it producing and processing clothes? Is it tools? Vehicles? Shipments? Truth be told it's not a bad puzzle, but nevertheless I feel that I'm just being asked to solve a not-quite-enjoyable mathematical exercise. There isn't even enough setup variation in the game to make this worth replaying. It's just the same puzzle every time. 

Traded away, no regrets.

I was afraid of the sandbox nature of the game.  I love Agricola and Le Havre.  I was hoping this was not a watered down version of either.  Instead you get a nice blend of both. Here are my thoughts after 2 plays: 

Let's see what is similar and how it is different:

Resource collection/conversion: up to 3 steps - similar to Le Havre in that you hang on to it and find a place to maximize it.  Lots of extra little places to burn it for something unlike Le Havre.

Goods:  Almost all goods are worth points at the end of game (some need a conversion).  Sort of similar to shipping in Le Havre but you don't have to ship.  Can give you a last push if you were lame and not able to do something better with them.

Worker placement: Like Agricola but more ways to have productive turns.  Most spots are pretty connected to each other.  It's nice having 4 workers out the gate.  

Buildings:  Mostly for points and one time resource gains.  Only a few give you in game abilities. Tough to decide whether it's worth it to buy them sometimes.

Fill your board:  Sort of like Agricola but there are negative things in place that are pretty easy to overcome (dikes, moors).  Once those are done you do not have to finish all the spots.  You get to work on strategy instead.  When I say strategy I mean min/max points versus burn the other player.  Your farm is how you want it to be.  Last game I made an animal farm and my wife made a field farm.

Vehicles and Tools:  Similar to the minor improvements in Agricola but everyone gets the use of most of them.  You get these to power up your actions, convert goods and make deliveries to other towns.  You could possibly try not to get a lot of vehicles but they are useful.  Another spot where you have to build at least one large vehicle or suffer negative points.

Different from both: 

Travel:  New thing you can do.  Use your vehicles to drop off goods to other towns and get food/points.  Somewhat abstract but useful for dumping goods or evening out animals for scoring.

Animals:  Animals still breed but they also give you goods.  End game scoring of them is a bit different in that to score maximum, all animals must be even in numbers across the three available.  

Overall I like the game and hope to play it often enough to not forget how to play.  It burns the brain quite a bit trying to maximize the options or even just see how they are connected.  I would place this in the "epic" Euro department.  Those games when you want a longer playing game that is filled with interesting decisions but doesn't entirely math out.  Our first game took 2 hours and 43 minutes.  The next game was 1 hour and 40 minutes.  I see some legs on this one and hope to always increase my score and beat my opponent.

update:  We are getting faster at this game - a little over an hour.  Buildings are fun and help improve your score and the timing of them allow you to skip certain base actions.

RATING: 7.5
So far none of the Rosenberg big box games have been bad. I own most of them and wouldn't mind owning the ones I don't own. But this game is 2 player only. And since I hardly play with just 2, I wasn't sure I needed this. And I probably don't, but I'm still glad I own it.
This is kind of an overwhelming game. Not a first from Rosenberg. The first times I played [thing=35677][/thing] and [thing=70149][/thing] my brain didn't have a good overview yet of which buildings where available. After a couple of plays that problem went away though. In Fields of Arle it's the amount of different actions that is quite significant. They are all clearly laid out on the board, but there are a lot of them, so again it will take a couple of plays to get a good feel for them and how to use them to the best effect.
In my first game we both took very different approaches, yet we ended up within 3 points from each other. Is that because we are equally good or because the game is so balanced it doesn't really matter what you do? Time will tell.
One thing that became very clear in this first game was that I needed to invest in vehicles sooner, you really do need more to set you up for a good score in the end. I was ill prepared for the last round and I wasn't able to optimize my score.
I enjoyed the game quite a bit. It is a very solid design, but from this one play it is hard to say how good it is.

Initial rating: 7.5/10
BGG scale: 7/10

Update after 2nd play: we know the rules but we still don't really know how to play. It's still very much a learning experience. I scored about 20% more than the first time, but Myriam scored less than in the first game, so we still have ways to go to master this game.

„Pola Arle”, czyli rolnik szuka… wszystkiego 

Plusy: 
1. Solidne wydanie (tylko tektura i drewno) 
2. Przejrzysta mimo mnogości elementów i grafik 
3. Mechanika 
4. Instrukcja 
5. Zależności występujące w grze 
6. Wariant solo 

Minusy: 
1. Tylko dla lubiących euro-suchary 

„Pola Arle” to bardzo dobra gra euro od specjalisty w tym temacie. Wykonanie jest świetne ( drewniane zwierzaki, tekturowe żetony drewna/desek, gliny/cegieł, odzieży itd.). W grze widać, że została przemyślana i testowana bardzo długo. Dało to taki efekt, iż wszystko tu jest logiczne – Potrzebujesz torfu? Najpierw osusz teren a potem go wykop, aby wykopać potrzebujesz łopat. Potrzebujesz więcej koni? Poczekaj do wiosny, Twój rozpłodowy ogier i klacz mają ograniczone możliwości (koń też człowiek odpocząć musi ;)) . Można by tak wyliczać i wyliczać logiczne powiązania różnych działań, ale są wszędzie i wszystko ze sobą współgra tak jak powinno. W grze mamy 9 rund a w każdej czteroosobową rodzinę do pracy i tu zaczynają się schody, bo możliwości jest mnóstwo a robotników tylko czworo. Trzeba dobrze przemyśleć, do czego ich wykorzystać, bo zła decyzja może odbić się nam czkawką na kolejną wiosnę. Musimy podjąć decyzję, w jaką dziedzinę gospodarki pójdziemy, tu kilku srok za ogon raczej nie złapiemy. Wąska specjalizacja to klucz do sukcesu. Gra jest bardzo dobra. Polecam 8/10. Ave Uwe!

Uwe Rosenberg is a great designer. However, most of his games released after the masterful harvest trilogy just falls a bit flat. Gone is the ease of play, the slow build up and the anxiety. In Agricola and At the gates of Loyang you really felt like the game wanted to hurt you. 

What we get now are games with lots of bits and no fear of starvation. Everyone can do eveything and no one has to feel sad.

It's a bit like trying to improve Shakespeare by casting Jean-Claude Van Damne and adding explosions. It all feels a bit tacky.

That said this is still a good game. It's just not as good as Uwe used to be.

Only one full play so far, but the game seems right up my alley. It's not at all punishing like some of the designer's games, there are tons of ways to get points, and the game plays surprisingly quick once you know it (probably around an hour). You still have to feed your people and keep up with some maintenance, but it's much easier here than in Agricola and not nearly as punishing. I was a little concerned about the set up being mostly static every game, but it seems like even small changes in early plays can really change up how you play each game.

Update: Played a couple more times now and the game is fantastic.

What a game!  I have every Uwe, and I feel like Fields of Arle hits a totally new niche. It's long, sure, but you can do a lot and I really feel like I'm managing a farm instead of attempting to build a food engine like in Agricola. I guess it gives off a similar vibe as Glass Road, probably due to the art (same guy), tiles, and player boards. To me, this is a longer and more indepth version of ACBAS, which is actually what I wanted anyway. I feel like each of his games has a special time and place and number of players. Uwe is the king at making these resource management/worker placements games!

Dutch first edition, with applied official sticker to correct error on main board.
Why o why does 999-games put their ugly logo, and even worse a QR-code on the front of this otherwise beautiful box?

Punching the boards and stickering the wooden pieces reminded me of wargaming days (Europe Engulfed in particular). An exercise in mindfulness, preparing the game to be played.

First play was solo, to get the rules right and to understand the difference with Agricola ACBAS. I scored 83 points and immediately felt the urge to play it again, to do it better!

Second play was with two. The experience wasn't much different than playing solo but I had to keep an eye on the other board to see what actions could be taken away before I got there. Some confusion about the starting lighthouses which has to be sorted out. Other than that, perfect game. 

A final word about the theme: there is no other game I can think of that has this beautifully designed autobiographical touch. Hats off for Uwe!

One play, it was nice and didn't feel that long. Setup takes time as well as the explaining the rules, but the game itself is quite intuitive and makes sense. Players are surprisingly farmers trying to gather resources and food while constructing buildings and vehicles and gathering points in medieval time. There were no long term tactics and I hope to play this more in the future to get a better feeling about the game and balance - points do come from various sources, but I hope it is balanced.

I think this is Uwe Rosenberg's Magnum Opus. No longer satisfied with simulating a single aspect of a medieval village, like farming, trading or glass blowing...No, this time he has decided to translate the entirety of that existence to boardgame form.

Fields of Arle is a sandbox. You can just treat it as Agricola version 3.0 if you want and you will probably score well. But you aren't limited to that. Want to be a shipping magnate? Buy some carts and start delivering goods to neighboring villages. Want to bypass the sustenance grind? Then focus on being the master builder and start erecting buildings in the village. Still not interested?

Then be a butcher, a baker, a tanner or a tailor. Seriously, there are a ton of viable paths to take. At first I worried a little about the game's re-playability, because there are only a couple spots that are randomized. After having played it a couple of times though, I think there are so many viable paths that it will take quite a long time to fall into a rut. Being strictly a two player game is kind of a bummer, but the scope is so huge it might not even work with three or four. 

Regardless of that, this is a must buy game for any Rosenberg or Agricola fan.

Another of the ur-Agricola branches. This one is very fixed, very stable, mostly because of the slight nods toward variability (almost so slight that I wonder why they bothered).

Still, there's a lot here, and it's amazing to me how well-tuned these variants are.

Perhaps the perfect 2-player offspring of Agricola meets Caverna.

A well-designed, demanding game, but it's way too "sandboxy" for my taste. This is a game for players who like to experiment with new strategies and exploit the game engine to its extreme. You are still restricted by only four actions per round, but you can do whatever you like for the entire game and hope that it gives you enough points to beat the other guy.

Played twice in a row with Tim at BGG Con 2015. This is a great game that expands and diverges from the Agricola formula. For a game that is only 2 players it isn't different enough from the already excellent Agricola 2 player version to fire that for me but could be worth having if you love the style of game and play a lot with 2 players.

Lengthy set up, but a great competitive game wherein the latter rounds require intense thinking to maximize victory points.  Great theme that carries throughout the entirety of the game. 

The more I play it, the more I realize the breadth of winning strategies!

As a solo game, this isn't as good as Loyang or Glass Road. For one thing, there isn't enough variability in the available buildings to make each game a unique puzzle. For another, it's too huge; setup is a pain, and it's a table hog. Chances are that I will never get to play this as a multiplayer game, so it has to stand on its solitaire merits, and it just doesn't have enough going for it to hit the table when other Uwe games are better.

A sprawling mega two player worker placement. It has a familiarity with elements from his earlier farming sims with Viticulture-like seasonal actions and adding dikes to reclaim submersed lowlands. This game greatly expands on your conversion and upgrade choices. I like the mechanic that allows you to use a blocked action for a fee. I appreciate his preference to manage resources with a levels track instead of a mass of colored wooden cubes.  Big game, lots of choices, lots to do. I like the long range strategy element of developing trade and commerce with neighboring towns and villages neatly scored along a trodden path.

One of Uwe's best games. There are so many paths to victory, animals, cloth & leather, travelling, buildings.....

It's also such a joy to play.

26 Dec '16: Played a solo game and was very impressed with the overall experience - the game is so beautifully crafted. Looking forward to more plays, solo and duo. 

6 Jan '17: Played twice more (2p) and I'm really enjoying exploring the game space, there is so much to do and while it's not yet flowing easily we are starting to get the hang of what we can do.

10 Sep '17: Three more solo games, this game is really meaty but still short enough (60 to 90 mins) to be a really good solo option. So many options at play and so many paths to building up points. One concern is getting stuck in a rut of doing the same thing each time in the solo game, would like to try a variant that simulates another player.

Excellent farming worker placement resource conversion game by Uwe Rosenberg.  Less pressure and more sandboxy than Agricola, perfect game for 2, with plenty of meat.

1-2 players. 85 points on first solo-play. 110 is supposedly the score to beat. Seems easier than Agricola, paying your upkeep isn't quite so crippling. Liked the theme. One of my 2 most heavy games - weighs about a ton! Looking forward to more plays though I wonder if I'll ever find anyone to play it with.

Another slam dunk for Uwe. This would have intolerable downtime with more than 2 players, but as it is, you have just enough time to sort through the labyrinth of options and paths you could take. This game is awesome. Period.

Uwe Rosemberg ha creado muchos de mis juegos preferidos, este título es uno de esos puntos redondos y bien definidos dentro de la coherencia, del sendero que está marcando con sus diseños. 

Su lenguaje es conocido pero no copiado, hay vacas y ovejas pero estas pastan de una forma diferente, estos campos también se pueblan de árboles pero su ramas se mueven con otro aire. Creo que vale la pena detenerse para conocer mejor Arlé y disfrutar de sus posibilidades. 

Es un juego distinto, tan sólo la calidez de su tema muestra cual es su linaje y parentesco con sus hermanos mayores.

This is the best 2 player game my wife and I have and have played.
The only reason for 9 stars instead of 10 is that it takes so long time to play!
The 60 min stated is by a long stretch not true - the setup takes somewhere from 10-20 minutes usually and it also takes up a lot of space on your table.
But with that being said, it is a truly wonderful game. The depthness of tactic in this game is great - there is a possibility to block your opponent, but this is usually at a great cost for yourself. So you really have to consider if you want to intervene or not - I love it.
I would love to play this game more often but we have to set aside 3 hours from setup till it is packed away at least! more often it is 4hours or more.
But great game!
If you are looking for a 2 player game, where tactics is a major part of it, and where your own skill, rather than luck of the draw, dice or drafting mechanics, is the primary reason of your win or loss, then you should most definitely buy this game!

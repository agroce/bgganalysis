A lot of clever moving parts with a nice slant on worker placement/retrieval.

Basically the 5 workers pawns of all players are white, numbered 1 to 5. Once played you lose ownership.  At retrieval time you take it in turns to retrieve little groups of 1 or more workers, trying to get the right spread of values you need.

I've not encountered this neat game mechanism before in which worker retrieval actually has its own game play going on.  it's not a decision of when to get them back - it's which groups of them you select.

Ave Roma is a fun game to play with, the components are nice and there are some mechanics that are extremely interesting (like the workers placement and the subsequent phase of taking it back), but after the first rounds it starts to become chaotic. Player's area is filled with cards that can be used in too many ways and it's very hard to keep up with it sometimes. Besides that, the game is enjoyable, better if played with 5 people.

Uitleg gekregen op Spiel 2016.
Boeiend wp spel.  Unieke twist met die kleurloze workers.
Mooi rond bord.

Regels bestuderen lijkt wat moeilijk, maar de symboliek en de gameplay zijn uiteindelijk wel helder.
Pure wp en resource mgt.
Advanced game is wel een pak moeilijker, en niet ideaal voor first time players.

Indien je je beperkt tot de kaarten voor het aantal spelers, en geen uitbreidingen toevoegt, kan het spel zeer snel voorbij zijn.  En dat is niet leuk!
Beter full option, maar voorzie voldoende tijd!  (4 uur voor 4 personen)

Some interactions in this game are lovely; particularly among the blue/white/brown actions and the cards. But it's just so darn fiddly, and there are also a number of questionable iconographic choices where it feels like form was favored over function.

Ave Roma's central mechanism of worker retrieval is certainly a clever tweak on the worker placement genre, but the area majority and set collection aspect are just mundane and have overwrought mechanisms. The plethora of icons and minutia on the cards will take a while to decipher and begs to be streamlined. The advance game brings an amusing aspect to the game, but it also adds a certain amount of fiddliness. The game would have benefited from a little more development. 

I would suggest to remove a few cards from each deck to make the game play faster. Otherwise, it becomes too redundant and repetitive if played with too many cards.

Still, it is an enjoyable mid-weight game that has some interesting decisions and some areas that have compelling tensions.

Played once and liked it. However this feels overloaden and complicated for no reason, so it could and should have been polished some more before the release.

The first game will just overwhelm because of a bad designed board (it is double sided with a more clean one, though, which I will try out next time). It will take time to get used to where all the stuff is and you have to see every small detail (including names and many different symbols), so it's really not easy to spot the things you are looking for. Being a very complex game doesn't help here, too.

I still like the game, though, as the main mechanics are nice and somewhat new. There are many ways to choose from and it feels balanced so far. So, while the above may sound very negative, it's more like nitpicking, even though some of those points do really bother me and others. It is a complex games that you need to play more often to get the full enjoyment out of it. Lets see where it goes once I played it some more.

I think the cards are poor. It's difficult to keep track of what's been scored and what hasn't and that part of the mechanism doesn't feel as well thought through.

The area control/majority concepts are all nothing new and pretty boring. The quirks that makes this game interesting are the way in which the resources are managed (take them when they're expensive, sell em and buy cheap ones) and the way that you form your workforce by taking neutral workers back at the end of the round.

Some good ideas that justify a 0.5 more in my rating. I think there are major mystakes in the design, as usually with kickstarter games. So for example at the very beginnning of the game you have exactly 20 different options, not to mention that you must choose for each one of your five workers, each with unique value. So it approximately 20*5 options? (i'm not good at maths). This aspect conduces at AP and in the end gives you no control on the game.

First play. This is a type of game that I tend to like a lot and, indeed, there are some good elements to the game, particularly the novel mechanism for determining your workers from round to round, and the various ways to score points enabling players to develop different strategies. However, there is one stand-out bad element to the game, which really impacts on a first play - the iconography is far too small. Given that there are a lot of icons, and that not all of them are self-explanatory, this makes the game unnecessarily difficult to play. Besides this, some other aspects of the game are less than satisfactory. The Patron cards were underpowered, both in terms of the bonus/ability (it is called both in the rules) and the game poitns - I don't know if that is a feature of the deck as a whole, or just of the set of cards that we saw. Due to this, very few of these cards were taken, which also meant that few new cards appeared, making a vicious cycle.  I had a look at the rule book after playing the game and saw that it also has flaws - the text is too small, the translation into English could be better (that's what you get for not employing a native speaker), and some of the terminology is inconsistent.  

All in all, a good effort from a first-time designer (who clearly likes Stefan Feld games), which is let down by flawed production from a publisher that should have improved by now (this being their 6th game).

RATING: N/A
Interesante juego de gestión de recursos ambientado en la antigua Roma. Está basado en la colocación de trabajadores en una tablero central pero le da dos vueltas de tuerca.

Primero, cada jugador dispone de cinco trabajadores numerados del uno al cinco. En función del número determinadas acciones son más potentes cuanto más alto el número (por ejemplo hay una acción que da dos monedas por cada punto del trabajador, 1 -> 2, 5 -> 10), mientras que otras es justo al revés, primando los números bajos (por ejemplo las de selección de cartas, en la primera posición solo se puede entrar con un uno, en la última del 1 al 5)

Pero la vuelta de tuerca interesante viene a la hora de recoger los trabajadores. Todos son del mismo color. Entonces, en orden inverso de turno, un jugador elige una localización de acción y coge TODOS los trabajadores allí presentes. Así en orden inverso hasta que todos vuelven a tener cinco trabajadores, claro con numeraciones diferentes.

Además, cada jugador dispone de un tablero individual que representa su provincia dentro de Roma y que le marca unos recursos iniciales y más curioso, distinto valor en monedas para cada recurso en relación a otros jugadores.

Puede ser muy propenso al AP

interesting twist on worker placement in a very crowded genre/theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A worker placement game where workers are numbered 1 through 5. Some spaces require a worker in a certain range, other spaces have actions that depend on the number. At the end of the round players retrieve workers in reverse turn order following some simple constraints. At the end of that process each player has 5 workers with various values. Then turn order is set so that the person with the smallest sum of worker values is first, and so on.

The game play features three primary point sources. The first is to get end game points from cards which you can buy, and which have different conditions for scoring points. The second is to spend resources in the Colosseum which advances your senate track which gives increasing points for each subsequent step. The third is to invest influence in one of the 5 regions. This will award more points if the region sees a lot of action. Here you want to fight for first place in popular regions or try to ride other people's coattails.

Things I like:
-The worker retrieval phase is unique and interesting. Small numbers are useful to get newly placed cards. Large numbers are good to get money and move on the Colosseum track. Getting lots of the same number can help if you want to make a particular region more valuable.
-The scarcity of the surplus resource. You can only get it by overflowing one of the other resources, but it's used a lot leading to a significant amount of planning around acquiring it.
-Buying personality cards to improve actions and get end game points. This is not new ground by any means but it is well done here. Assembling a few bonuses for an action is fun and can help craft a strategy.
-The different scoring options can lead to different game play. 

Things I disliked:
-There are too many resource types. There are 8 different things that can be spent to pay for cards. This, coupled with the transient nature of the region cards that dictate which resources you can gain, leads to a rather long and boring chain of actions to simply buy a card. This could have been streamlined to help players get to the fun parts of the game.
-Players will incidentally increase the value of a region because actions that gain resources do this by default. You can do it intentionally, and that's great and interesting, but it also happens completely arbitrarily, which I find annoying. A player that really needs a particular resource might end up king making.
-The worker retrieval phase, which I put under like also appears here because although I like the idea of it I'm not convinced it adds enough to warrant the added time.
-The scoring options encourage specialization. This means that once you start down a road you are really encouraged to see it though. It's not easy to change gears in response to game play. It leads to diversity between plays, but feels rather restrictive during a particular play. 

The game is okay, but not great. It seems to be in need of a final streamlining to smooth a few rough edges. It's exactly the kind of game you expect to see from kickstarter. Good ideas, a nice effort, but not quite there. Don't even get me started on the 5 expansions included in the kickstarter version. This game has plenty that needs to be removed as it is, I can't believe they added 5 modular expansions O_o
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
1 play of the prototype with advanced rules - In a nutshell, the game works and offers relevant choices. For my personal taste, it could have been more streamlined and some elements like the numbered workers and the method to reclaim them don't fully realize their potential, at least with our player count of three players. The different action elements are not completely balanced and could need further finetuning. Some more thoughts should be put into scaling the game to the number of players.

I understand that there will be further changes in the published version. For example, the handling of the area influence will be changed which I appreciate as currently it's not a very elegant although essential system.

I'm not a fan of Kickstarter games. I also played Trickerion before release and wasn't very fond of it. I traded away Euphoria which was one of two Kickstarters I supported. I didn't like Alien Frontiers. So I'm not the target audience for this or many other small press games.

RATING: 9
I own the game but played it before it arrived thanks to a pal who got his kickstarter version before I got mine directly out of Essen16. I assumed the game will be good, but wow - this game is devilish good. There is so much to consider and cards are going away damn quickly. Add to this all the brainbending puzzles when you want to get the best out of your turn, which means to consider card bonusses, symbol bonusses (in the expert game) and the abilities of your active patrons, and you are in for a hell of an ancient roman ride. It's so much, but plays quick and swift (although AP-prone people like me really should use a game timer xD). And although I lost my first game it didn't feel devastating like other games did. 

Oh and visually the game is awesome. The quality is top notch and although there is a tiny missprint on one side regarding the expert version (I think there was one card icon missing at one of the action locations expert bonusses) the game has every necessary information on it you need to know at any time. If you love Feld'ish sort of games then do yourself a favor: Get this one!

Advanced game is a more interesting game but also way more fiddly. Twas sometimes confusing remembering which bonus meant to tap the card and which one was supposed to move to the right side of the player board. 

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This is pretty typical worker placement EXCEPT that there is then a draft to pick up the workers who don't actually belong to anyone. One takes all the workers at a location or just enough to get back to five. 8-9 different worker action spots. Curious to try some of the mini expansions/advanced game. The round board is also a nice touch.

Rules misplayed first game:

1. Training spots delay a current worker until next placement opportunity when worker takes on the new value (doesn't wait until the next round which meant no one ever used it!)
2. Passive Patron cards also score end game points (don't think this was an issue)
3. Influence counter never starts on the 0 - only can end up there on final scoring.
4. Didn't matter since we played base game only, but cards only move from left side to right side of player board after bonus actions of advanced game.

It's perfectly fine game. Workerplacement and a friendly one. Includes resource management of course. Lots of options, there is always something interesting to do. Therefore not much interaction, opponents don't bother you much. It misses the tightness and the turnangst of many other, better workerplacement games. Also, it is not very original, it's just another theme translated into a workerplacement game. Collect stuff, spend it for points. Having said all that, remember that I am rather critical when it comes to WP games. I am looking for innovations and originality in mechanics. This one has too little of that. But there is nothing wrong with the game, it's a perfectly fine game that I wouldn't mind to play again.

Play two rounds in Essen'16 (not a full game) and the worker placement gave it a nice twist, where you can try to optimize your moves quite a bit (which I like!). But I think the more players are playing the more it gets unpredict-/unplanable and feels more like short term optimization game. With less player you are more likely beeing able to anticipate the upcoming actions of the other players, which makes it more interesting for me. I'm planning to buy this at least medium-heavy euro game as soon it get reprinted (they are completely out of stock). P.S.: For sure it is not a game for everyone - but I like it very much

>棕色 根據放個工人數字對應的地區卡拿上面顯示的所有資源
>灰色 根據工人數字對應的地區卡卡買上面顯示的物品(只要有數量不限)最多4個和賣六個任意你的物品，價格根據你的個人圖版
*上面兩個動作如果蓋地區沒地區卡不能執行
>深藍色 使用對應藍色卡牌上面顯示數字的工人跟支付對應費用拿該卡到各人圖版左邊，並拿上面分數，如果收集到兩張一樣名字的拿兩張的右上獎勵
>紅色 同藍色只是拿紅色卡，拿到第幾張同名就拿右上對應第幾列的獎勵
>藍色 同上面用使用方式，拿對應區域的上或下的兩個物品，之後可選擇拿另外一邊的一個物品或是使用之前拿到的紅/深藍卡橫置增加該地點影響力，增加時不同玩家方塊不能在同格，沒能超過就失去對應點數
*以上使用地區行動對應的地區卡第一次使用後上移，上移的使用後玩家要付兩圓拿走該卡，並上移棕色方塊一格，並放新卡補充，如果該格本來就空付兩圓，沒其他效果，地區卡右上有兩個一樣符號就拿對應資源
>橘色 根據工人數字在轉盤上走對應格數，支付走過的所有費用，經過人就右移個人圖版下方影響力標記，前五格可增加放贊助者卡的能力，有人在的格不用支付費用
>綠色 跟拿卡規則相同，綠色卡只有影響力夠才會移到圖版下，卡片最下效果才有用，拿到新的可跟下面的交換啟動
>圖版訓練工人 之付金錢放工人到對應訓練格，下次可使用該工人跟修正的數值來放
2.補充階段 地區卡以外卡片如果都沒被拿則移除最右的，之後(不管有沒被拿)所有左移補新的，之後反順位拿場上工人，每次選擇一區盡量全拿除非到五個則挑想拿的拿，所有人都有五個工人後結束
3.設定順位 加總所有工人數字，數字最小的先，平手則之前的順位對調
*遊戲在地區卡沒法補時該行動輪結束結束或是補牌時有牌無法補也馬上結束，之後所有玩家可以做最後一個動作，且工人數字自選，動作也不會被阻擋
*最後記分 所有區域方塊超過棕色格的往下移，照相對順序維持到對應格，然後根據記分板塊拿分數(被推到0的拿該區基本分)，之後每5圓1分，3資源1分，贊助卡分數，圖版影響力分數
**2人變體**
*兩人都拿一組額外的五個工人，每次行動階段放完自己工人放一個中立工人到3~5玩家的行動格(只有五個行動可做)，補充階段，收工人時反序玩家收完一輪換反序中立收，決定順位只看自己的工人總合
**進階遊戲***
*除地區卡外每疊卡頂牌打開，每個行動可使用之前買的卡加強，所有符號只能選一個使用但同種可用多張，可在主行動前或後使用拿到地點卡的行動時，先拿地點卡在選擇主要跟額外加強行動
>黃 多兩圓
>棕 多拿一個該地區卡資源，沒卡不能用
>白 多一個奢侈品
>藍 一次要用三張同樣的，提升該地點影響力一格
>卡片行動 可買頂牌，且根據顏色每張減免資源/奢侈品/兩圓
*頂牌永遠保持開起，補牌後一樣在開
*贊助卡可能因此從右移到左，可再多用一次

Decent game. Thematic it could be anything though. Having a different set of workers with a value of 1 to 5 every round is a nice twist. Apart from that there are many, almost too many options available to score points. Make combo's and maximize their score seems to be the right approach.

This is my kind of game: a lot of options, a lot of stuff. I really like the numbered workers mechanics and the way you retrieve them. 

One small downside is that there is a few game-end conditions but there always is the same that's triggered: you run out of province cards.

RATING: 7
Ave Roma is a worker placement game where each player has 5 workers numbered 1-5. However, when you take workers back, you don't get the same workers, so you could end up with a different mix of numbers. High numbers get you more money on the money spot, but low numbers get you more options on the card selection spots, and other spots have actions that correspond to specific numbers. The game is intertwined very well, so while it's advantageous to focus on particular things, you do still participate in the whole game. The game is a little fiddly, in that there are cards, cubes, and discs all over, and it's a little too easy to knock them out of place. That said, I think the gameplay worked well, and had some fun with this.

Terrible. This game is everything that's wrong with contemporary euro-trash games. An uninspired and innovative collection of euro mechanics, with no player interaction and no connection to the theme. None of the choices are interesting. I'd rather help a friend paint a house than play this again.

I loved the unique worker placement mechanic in this game! You start with workers numbered 1-5 (all players have the same colored workers) and the workers can only be placed in spots corresponding to their number. At the end of the round, you draft the workers back, which usually results with you NOT having one of each number. 

The rest of the game could have used a bit more development. The cards had many, small icons. This made the set collecting unnecessarily challenging as the cards are placed all over the board and are difficult to see. This unfortunately took away from the enjoyment of the game. I also didn't like the ancient Rome theme, it's over done IMO.

tl;dr: solid strategic euro

This is the type of euro I like: pretty streamlined rules, but lots of options and different strategies to pursue. And more than one of them seems viable. There are parts of the game you can completely ignore and focus completely on optimizing your engine without certain elements. I always like it if games offer that options and still offer a balanced game. Good job, designers!
There are a few issues with the icons and colors that could have been a bit better, but nothing that breaks the game.
What I don't like about this game is that it comes with seven or so expansions. Please, designers, make choices and make the best version of the game possible, and don't throw the box full of ideas that players can then combine to taste. Because then you have to try a lot of different combinations to figure out what the best version of the game actually is. Just give me that best version from the start, and offer the rest in expansions that are released at a later stage, just for the people who want to try more different versions. I'm only interested in playing the best version.
But this is a good game, certainly worth playing.

Interesting puzzle.  The action selection mechanism was pretty unique and there felt like there were a lot of choices to make.  It doesn't really stand out from an already crowded field but it is a good game.

RATING: 7
Good worker placement strategy game. In the few plays I have under my belt, it felt rather obvious that you have to commit to a certain path to victory: either the senate route (patrons) or the influence in province route. It feels like it doesn't pay (enough in terms of points) to diversify. Still, I like the game a lot because each turn you wish you had just one more worker or just one more resource. Challenging.

Deeper economic management game with a very unique balancing mechanism through the use of community workers to place. Otherwise a fairly typical process of managing resources and converting them to victory points through the purchasing of cards.

RATING: 7
This is a very good game with an innovative mechanism for worker placement. But it is complex and its complexity does not actually add to the game. Also it is not tight enough (most of the time, the numbers in your workers do not actually restrict you to do actions).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice worker placement game. Sometimes we felt like the designer had not a clear idea of what he was doing (endgame extra action with "imaginary worker", "advanced" game mechanics). The nice components make it fun to play. Having dozen of cards to tap, cover, "use" (moving them from the left of your player board to the right of it to trigger advanced effects) is twisted but fun.

I like the core concepts of this game- the worker retrieval mechanic and the twist on area majority scoring are both intriguing and add some interactive tension. Sadly though, Ave Roma heartily embraces the recent trend of cramming in as many symbols, conversions, happy cards and bonus actions as possible; turning what might have been a solid mid-weight experience into an overwrought and overlong albatross of a game.

Good looking resource collection and building/favour/influence buying game. What makes it stand out is the worker placement - all workers are same colour and at end of each round you take it in turns to pick up the workers you are going to use next round.

RATING: N/A
Worker placement to gain the highest reputation from your efforts in the glory of Rome. Played on a round board... No player colors...what? Lots of interesting twists in worker action choices. The biggie is mono-colored workers with assigned values to place for the best benefit--High values on multiplier buy,sell,trade actions and low or specific values to select the best senator, building military or region card. Influence level effects how many patrons you can retain(bribe?)--great. Refill workers with a unique draft in reverse player order to retrieve workers from the action spaces. Huge part of strategy to match your next round needs with the right combination of values. Basic and advanced rules.  I can see this becoming a popular strategy game.

Néha eléggé átláthatatlan, csontszáraz munkáslehelyezés, ami egyébként tele van jó ötletekkel. Sajnos nekem nem állt össze az egész - tipikusan az a játék egyébként, amivel kell még játszani, h letisztuljon, csak ezzel nincs kedvem többet. Sokkal jobbak vannak a témában. :(

Challenging choices to make, as you just can't do everything you feel you need to do. Simple, clever wargame, with the block bluffing and 'fog of war' of block games keeping you on your toes.

RATING: 9
The map and the components of this classic are spectacular. The map is one of the most beautiful in a wargame.
The dimension of fun provided by this game is multiplied if you use the simo-move system.
Each player indicates (secretly) on a sheet of paper where he want to activate his naval and ground units. 
Then - simultaneously - they move their Units/Fleets to their locations on the map.
The fact that there is a low density of units makes this game a more enjoyable and visual experience that other more recent titles from the same company.
Time flies with this one: Around two hours per session.

RATING: 6
An easy block game.  Not a simulation but a lot of fun, but I really like block games.  The rules are a lot like [thing=85][/thing], but there are no feigning attacks and dummy blocks, but you manage 3 fronts.  The Americans really have to play smartly on the first turn and if not, they'd better brace themselves for the British juggernaut on the 3rd turn.

A fun, but certainly not a very deep game: avoid like the plague if you hate luck. I've only played once, but I suspect there is a limit to the number of strategic options one has, on either side. Having said that, with luck being such a strong factor ("SIX!! I NEED A SIX!!!"), it seems that even with limited strategic options, each game will play quite differently than the last. I like it, but am definitely not in love with it.

Very interesting geostrategic situations. Very beautiful map. One of the lesser Columbia Games though.

Hits are mainly done on a one (1) on a six-sided die. This means a large standard deviation and so a greater luck factor. It means also a lot of dice rolling.

I wished Columbia Games redesigned this game to modern standards.

simple rules, and i was looking forward to trying it.  especially the simultaneous option.  well i did, and i was really unimpressed.  maybe i wasn't in the right mood, but it was all just kinda bland to me.  maybe i need too much chrome with my blocks.  on the upside this does seem like a decent starter block game, and it's got the best-looking map i've ever seen from columbia.  i'd rather give the apparently similar quebec simultaneous movement block game a shot.

Initial Impression: This is the simplest of the Columbia block games. The map is wonderfully bright and colorful. The blocks are of a high quality. This is a game that I would use to introduce a budding wargamer to the concept of block wargames. However, I'm not sure that there are many strategic decisions and almost no tactical decisions. After a play or two I would graduate the beginner to something a bit deeper. Still, an enjoyable game with a surprisingly short playing time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a great entry level war game that seems like it might have legs to cope with many plays.  I have also played Hammer of the Scots which I think might be the better "game" but the quick playing time and simple rules of this together with the wonderful looking map mean this will get played much more.   Although there is a good amount of luck your choices really seem impactful and the amphibious movement mechanic makes for really interesting choices.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
This one rocks for playability but, "tanks" for realism.  Easy to learn, never plays exactly the same way twice.  The "10" is for how much my students have enjoyed it during lunch recess.  It is not the kind of game to play in order to teach the challenges both sides faced during the War of 1812, other than perhaps the choice of attacking on one side of the Great Lakes, or the other, or trying both sides.  The map design is probably the worst I have ever seen in a Columbia Game.  It reminds me of those maps of college/university towns that colourfully show where all the beer joints are located, along with other "fun" spots for the young at heart.  Sigh.  Good Times.

Update 3/21/10: Under 3.0 rules I don't need to roll a 6!

Fantastic introduction to block games features the war of manuever and control around the lower Great Lakes during the years 1812-14. The Americans must hit hard and fast, capturing as many towns as they can before the Brits can bring their heavy reinforcments in the final year. Lots of tough decisions and sharp battles will keep beginner and grognard alike interested for a long time.

Fun but susceptible to one 6-filled battle swinging the entire game.  Also, felt like chasing your tail around a tree:  one side would advance in the West, and have to retreat in the East, because you can't be strong everywhere, or even hold in one area while you attack in another.  For a simple block game, Quebec 1759 is far superior, most notably because it includes the simultaneous orders and tactical battle element.

This was a fun game. My friend and I used to engineer the game to make sure Tecumseh entered the war. I found that the American had to work hard to gain momentum before all the Napoleonic veterans started showing up in 1815. Also some bad dice rolls would make it hard for the American to get his forces across the border.

Played the old edition with the very basic blocks (no initiative). This is quite a nice introduction to the world of block games. Battles are VERY luck dependent. But this makes success very much an issue of maneuver. You need to occupy lakes and enemy towns to win. But you need blocks to hold the towns. But to hold many, you need to spread. And if you do, you can get steamrolled - and each army block is a VP. Still, I prefer the more chromed out block games.

4 plays (simultaneous movement each time) - I like the high-impact, difficult strategic choices both face. The game moves along quite fast. Wild and woolly. Lots of tough decisions about deployment. I really like the victory point system, including the possibility of stalemate. Of course one must respect the sincere rulings of the gods of dice. And one does what a mortal can to implore these entities, such as a fancier method of spinning the bones. Simultaneous movement works fabulously... And it's fun to see the strain developing in the increasingly shaky handwriting of orders as the war goes on and plans go awry! Turn five is institutionalized as the turn requiring the most essential decision - open another bottle of wine?

A great way to introduce block gaming to folks- in other words, a great way to train potential Rommel in the Desert opponents.  Some nice historical notes and super-easy (but strategically rich) play make this a winner.  It's a good, smashmouth wargame with some pretty serious drama in the big battles.  Throwing dice is fun, too bad all the El Grande fans made it such a crime!

Very [u]enjoyable[/u] light operational card-less block wargame with a wonderful map. Fast, playable, tough decisions, interesting naval rules. Neither player has the forces to be strong everywhere so good planning is required to winning. It is quite luck dependent and the combat can turn into a dicefest. Playing with the Brits seems to be tougher, they must defend well.
Excellent [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/80325/war-of-1812-play-summary]Rules summary[/url] can be found at BGG.

This was the first wargame I ever played. My Dad bought this when it came out in '73. I was too young then to play with him, but as I got older we played many times. Now I have our copy, and I am introducing it to a new generations of players.

RATING: 9
This is a great introductory game for new gamers. The rules are simple, the choices interestting and skill will ususally win. The games moves fast and allows players many options.

The game is particularly well balanced in terms of victory conditions. There is also a balance in the style of play - neither player has the forces to be strong everywhere so decisions must be made regarding where to be on the defensive and where and when to be on the offensive.

Wow!  After one play, I'm hooked on this one.  My buddy and I started getting into the block games just recently.  We enjoyed Quebec 1759 quite a bit, but this one took it to the next level.  It kept things pretty simple for us newbie wargamers but there still was a lot to think about and there were a handful of extremely tense situations.  I feel like my rating might go up even further after a few more plays.

Very easy blockgame. Plays quick, lots of dice and a bit of strategy. Probably a decent intro wargame, but for more experienced wargamers War of 1812 is not that interesting. Problems:

- with all units hitting on a "6" and no terrain features, the amount of strategy is very limited.

RATING: 8
Where to begin? This game is older than I am, and yet it feels tense, fresh, and fun after all of these years. The fact it plays in 90 minutes flat probably helps a lot to make it feel so current. Maybe in the heyday of wargaming this was considered a kiddie game because of its short rules, elegant design, and lack of CRT. Thankfully these are again in vogue.
 
This is a low-density game over a wide, wide front with no depth. You can't possibly cover all all the holes, and too often you'll be bluffing. Control over the Great Lakes and the defense of Detroit are both key... but really everywhere is important! 
 
If you've honestly never played a single wargame in your entire life, then start with this. If you've tried something along the way, go straight for Hammer of the Scots and see what block games can really do.

RATING: 7
A very nice Columbia block wargame, the merges ease of play, history, and a healthy dose of dice-chucking-luck.  It actually feels a little more open and interesting strategically than Quebec 1759 (which I also enjoy, even in spite of my additional intrigue into 1812).  I have the original Gamma Two edition, which doesn't have different unit types.  Everything is the same and everything hits on '6's and rolls dice for its CV.  Very straightforward and I can see the new edition adding a bit more in terms of depth, but the original approach to the game in 1973 doesn't leave me feeling wanting for more.  It plays in about an hour and has some interesting areas to go.  A great game for those who thought Risk was the only game that exists where you can dice-chuck a war.  1812 has sense and sensibility and still gives us a game that isn't overblown with rules or numbing through rampant chaos and randomness.  There are some component issues with the original edition, but when you're playing a piece of history about history, I'm willing to overlook this stuff.

I don't think this is as good a game as [i]Liberty[/i] or [i]Hammer of the Scots[/i], but it stands as among the best titles from Columbia Games. While it lacks thematic touches and it doesn't really give one a feel for the strengths and weaknesses of each side it is filled with nail biting tension. In fact I'd say this is the most tense of all block games because setup is not rigid so you really don't know how strong the enemy is on the other side. It also helps that it is easy to play and makes for a great introduction to the system. There is one big flaw: a single defeat can spell your doom because losses are permanent! Be careful where and how you fight!

Simple block game on the cross-border operations during the War of 1812.  Plays fairly quickly, but there's not much action and the game seems too simplistic.  The Americans have a slightly stronger army, but some of them might refuse to cross the Canadian border.  Thus, both sides can feel reluctant to attack.  When the first player decides to gamble and attack across the border, the game can quickly snowball in favor of the winner of that first battle.

Clean, elegant and tense.  Three words that don't necessarily apply in equal measure to the actual War of 1812.  I really think the tight counter mix coupled with the interaction between naval warfare and the land campaigns around the Great Lakes makes this a true classic.  Every move is agony.  Every battle a necessary evil.  The true brilliant piece is the point-to-point map that always seems to be missing a connection or have an extra connection exactly when you don't need it.

A good intro to the Columbia games, this is a pretty well balanced and fun game.

RATING: 9
I have been meaning to pick this one up for years and I'm glad I did.  1812 is a tense and fast paced game. Small battles will have you at the edge of your seat as they decide large areas on the board.  You need to plan carefully as you never seem to have enough troops to do all that you want to do.

To get the most out of the game you must play using the simultaneous movement rules.

I have the most recent version with Dragoons and Artillery and Generals.  I'm not sure if changes the game play greatly, but I love seeing Isaac Brock battling it out against Winfield Scott or Harrison!

Great game about an often forgotten war.  I wonder if there will be renewed interest in this game as we approach the 200th anniversary of the conflict.

This is a good and simple war game. Good for a newbie wargamer like myself. Even early on I realize how limited this game is and I'd be quickly bored with it but I'll kept it as a warm-up for people I introduce to block games. After five plays I traded it away.

I like this game. And I really like the map. It's another hang-on-the-wall-pretty one. I suppose I really like it because it's my back yard. It's a bit long. But there are no cards so that speeds things along. And I really don't like the potential for a tie. Oh yes, I don't like the title. It's wrong. It's not the War of 1812, it's the Northern Campaign of the War of 1812. OK, so maybe I'm being pedantic.

You can do very little each turn, necessating having a strategy. But the mechanichs are too simple for this to hit the table; Hammer of the Scots will always win over this.

RATING: 8
Now here's an older game that I enjoy.  A variety of strategic options without a clear winner and simple, fast moving mechanics that can be summarized orally in a matter of minutes.  The situation emphasizes combined arms operations, with both naval and land action playing a role in obtaining victory.  The biggest problem is the heavy impact of luck as a few outlier results can create rapid swings in fortune.

I strongly recommend playing with the optional  rules used at the WBC - they help even out the luck factor and makes the game a much more competitive experience.

Based on 5 plays.  Aside from the battles, the game goes at a pleasantly brisk pace.  Luck is a little more influential than I might prefer, but not excessively so.  My opinion of the game has dropped a little bit as I have discovered other 2-player games (e.g. Twilight Struggle) of similar simplicity that I enjoy more.  To ameliorate the luck and shorten the length of combat, I've implemented a more deterministic way of resolving combat.  Instead of rolling one die for each CV in combat, players score one automatic hit for each set of 6 CVs and then roll a die for each remaining CV.  This method speeds up play, reduces the swing in battle, and still provides for tense and unpredictable outcomes.  I've only tried it in one game, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Played for the first time. Enjoyed but the game was all over half way through the second year. Bit of a over zealous start. Very hard to plan a stategic start in your first game as there are a number of issues that crop up that you couldnt plan for if you havent played (or read the rules in fine detail, but who does that before their first game huh?)

Cool game but the level of dice rolling relative to other actions pushes it dangerously close to tedious. Probably over 50% of the time is spent throwing handfuls of dice to resolve combat or see who has initiative. Maybe hitting on a 4  or something would be better. Everything else i like though.

Also as with all columbia games the board is way too small (i didnt even realise one of the lakes existed the first time i played..).

I like block games, as they are essentially games of maneuver where the key decisions are when and where to accept battle with how much forces for how long. This fits perfectly with the hidden information inherent in the block mechanic and the only detriment for my personally is, that I am not a big fan of hidden information games generally. Plus the block mechanic can begin to feel generic as it gets applied to more and more battles and campaigns. This game is a prime example of easy rules and exciting gameplay.

The blocks / fog of war is always attractive. There's a nice weight of pieces, not too many to be overwhelming. Different strategies are forced on the players, a good thing, with a downer being that the end-game battle(s) seem to get out of proportion relative to the smallness of what's gone on to date, making the early game seem a bit irrelevant. That may be inexperience talking though. A touch too much chrome to make it easily to the table, and hence replaced by Memoir '44 et al in the rotation.

Finally recieved a copy for my birthday, 2012. This is just perfect for me. It's the 1985 release, without a upc, the rulebook is very basic (no staples!), the box is warped and the game is clearly well loved. I sincerely look forward to playing this one soon as it appears to be "block gaming 101" when compared to all if my other Columbia block game titles (aside maybe from Quenec 1759)

A small step up from Quebec 1759 due to naval combat, supply, and variations in set-up force strengths. I prefer the omission of L-C-R combat columns for games with such few units and might try this with 1759. Lots of luck with the small number of units, especially the naval combat. British may do well to give up the west and control the center and east for the win.

Finally back in print! An essential purchase, not just as an introductory war game, but a quick-playing, strategic, easy-to-learn two player board game!

Amazing elegant war game. The rules are actually four pages long; the other four pages are reserved for historical background and cover art.

The game flows very quickly in part because you are only allowed to move units from only one city (naval units excluded). The small board (which features point-to-point movement rather than a hex grid), very low unit density (25 pieces per person) and the optional simultaneous move rules speed up the game even more.

The combat mechanism, from reading the rules, might seem too luck-heavy (most units only hit with a roll of 1 from a d6), the fact that you keep on fighting until someone is eliminated or retreats evens out the odds.

This definitely belongs on every gamer's shelf, especially those who grew up in Southern Ontario or the Midwest US, and those who have visited Fort Malden in Amherstburg, Fort York in Toronto, or Fort George in Niagara-on-the-Lake.  

I own the third edition, with stickers you must apply onto the blocks. The artwork is similar to Columbia Games' newer releases (so they don't look like the minimalistic symbols of the first edition).

This game seemed simplistic or dicey at first, but after repeated plays, I've come to realise that this is the sort of game that gets better the more you play, and the more you play skilled opponents. It's actually very difficult to win...most games ought to come out in draws. Demands of players careful long-term planning: each year has a rhythm of concentrating forces for a main effort and battle, then dispersal as units billet for the winter lest they die in the attrition phase. Force preservation is very important, thus it's best to avoid battles if possible.  Great game.

RATING: 5
While it seems a little cruel to beat up a veteran, even one with a spanking new face lift, this one has little to recommend it except as an entry level game - on that level you could add maybe 1.5 points. From the POV of an experienced wargamer it shares the problems of all of Columbia's output (that I've played anyway) - A claustrophobic, mechanical system geared towards stasis (the draw would be far and away the most common result) which precludes any strategic eureka moments apart from the initial set-up (which, although the high point of strategy in the game, is still just a shell-game). It is not without it's 'tactical' nuances but is still more of a puzzle than a game. It is actually because of these faults rather than despite them that makes it not a bad entry point for newbies and Euro Defectors - the inability to break out of the constrictions of the system mean that there is a considerable evening up of the chances of victory regardless of general skill level - as with all CGC games the illusion that a tense & close game has been fought out is general. In fact the players have actually been struggling with a system that plays them rather than vice versa. Even more than most games, how highly players are likely to rate this one depends upon personality & nuances of the suspension of disbelief. Columbia games depend very very heavily on players buying into the hidden strength aspect as weight bearer of their systems both as games and as simulations. If you don't buy into this then all you are looking at is a sexed up version of Stratego. I'm afraid that I ain't buying.

The limited knowledge the blocks afford can really make a big impact on the reactions of the players during the game. I enjoy the system even though the huge dice battles can get a bit silly and there can easily be a draw after two hours of play. It's different enough from my other combat games (such as Memoir '44), to make it worth playing. It's a system much refined and improved upon in Columbia Games' best two efforts - Hammer of the Scots and Julius Caesar.

RATING: 8
Probably the best intro wargame I've seen. Simple yet interesting and high replay value. Love the integration of land and sea power as well. Your navy is very relevant and gives you both VPs and possibilities for amphibious invasions. The blocks add the fog of war which is very relevant. (Also plays quickly except when neither player can roll any hits). All in all, a wonderful game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a tight game with little room for error.  The front is much wider than it is deep, and once control over the lakes are established, the flanking opportunities are wild and wooly.  In combat, units hit only on a '6' (or at least, I think they do -- I rolled almost none of them, so I couldn't actually say) which means that retreating and taking the pursuit fire is a viable option to try to preserve forces for later defense or even a counterattack.  With the varying unit strengths, bluff is extremely important -- you have to make your opponent more uncomfortable than you are yourself, and momentum is everything.  The first edition rules lack the refinement to basic block mechanics introduced over the last three decades, but they are still a fine ruleset, and we had no rule issues left unresolved.  All in all, an exciting and elegant game that breaks out in only 60-90 minutes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Recently played it again. I think it has begun to show its age. Since hits are (mostly) only on a roll of 1, it has huge swings of luck to it. Perhaps I'll try it once more with an increased hit roll, but that might do the game more damage then good since the point of the whole game is that you only have a few forces to move around. So what bugs me the mos, I guess, is that luck on the roll out ways most of the strategic thinking.

Interesting entry level war game. Rules are some 4 pages, which is nothing too complex. Oversight is easy to maintain, although choices are still abundant and complex!

It seems that the Americans have an advantage at the begining.  I'm not sure what the British strategy should be other than to protect Montreal and Quebec.  The combat system is more than a bit simplistic and annoying as the winner of the game is essentially whoever rolls the most 6s.  The game seems to follow the same system as Quebec 1759, although this game doesn't use any decoy blocks.

The combat system here is not really all that great; a couple of lucky rolls of 6's will give great advantage and swing the course of the war.

Awesome game.  Good for new wargamers and old, although the pacing and tempo of this game is very unusual.  Like all Columbia block games, it makes you feel like you have to leave one area uncovered to cover another area.  Nerve-wracking and frustrating (in a good way), even when you're winning.  Beautiful board and wooden blocks.  Often gets pulled out when we don't have anything particular planned for game night and we want a little combat.  Of all the block games I've played, I think this one has had the most diversity in the sessions we've played, despite the deceptively simple point-to-point map.  Agonizing decisions, indeed!

Revised in 2008, to include standard step-loss ship blocks and artillery.  Perhaps a little better for the changes.

This is a nifty little game, perfect for introducing someone to the joys of wargaming. And repeated play leads to a deeper appreciation of the inner strategies; it's simple... but each turn requires thought. Since the field of battle is so spread out, there are a multitude of small battles rather than the one massive battle that normally occurs in it's sister-game, Napoleon. And forget about retreating, it's much too bloody. The war covers three years and the American player has to act quickly before the the British reinforcements of the final year overwhelm him. The reluctant American militia must pass a die roll in order to cross into Canada and, in the west, he must guard against the Indians allies that the British can bring into the game. As the Americans, I have a hard time defending against a determined thrust south from Montreal during the first year. So I'd much rather play the British. Also, the key to game is the control of the lakes --but since both sides know this, the efforts there often nullify each other. The bottom line to this game is that it is just plain FUN.

After experiencing HotS, I was a bit disappointed when I read through the rules for War of 1812.  After playing it once, however, I am very pleased, and would play it many more times.  

Lots and lots of dice rolling!

Each battle feels like death or glory, just because only 1 is a hit and there are so few blocks. Later Columbia games are much better.

À acheter. Sans être un super wargame, l'aspect jeu de groupe en fait un excellent jeu interactif. Et les dés rajoute du suspens. On doit gérer le risque des manoeuvres. Sur le plan pédagogique, c'est un jeu à posséder pour vulgariser cette guerre.

A nice balanced version of the 1812 sideshow which means so much more to North Americans. I bought my copy at Fort York.

Early version of the game, felt very luck based.  We might have been playing a bit wrong.  Need to try simultaneous movement variation

This game is highly intelligent, intriguing and fun. I've played this game 100+ times and enjoyed every game. I've won more than I've lost. Some games were absolute blow outs, while others were decided in the last few turns. In my youth I considered trying to expand the game along the idea that the war continued into 1815 and beyond. It became very evident that this would become a hugely complex task and I dropped the idea.

Classic game fun for a quick play on a rainy day.
This is another fine example of an intro-game. 
I give it a 10 because it's easy to learn and fun to play.
My son loves the game and so do I!

Decent game that has aged well since 1973.  Good entry into block games, or as a gateway game.  Some serious wristage needed for larger battles.  Victory conditions seem to be a bit drawish, but that mirrors what happened historically.

The system is simply outstanding.  The game rules are relatively simple and plays smooth.  The map, blocks, and charts are well laid out and quite attractive.  The game provides tense situations and a whole lot of fun.

My first block wargame.  Play feels very constricted, but it was designed that way.  There is no traveling hither and yon in this game--not if you want to win.  Every choice you are faced with counts heavily toward your ultimate advantageous position.  

If you are knocked back on your heals or you have lost control of the lakes, it is hard to regain control.  It can be done, but you must become very tactical, very quickly.  Losses can sweep in with stunning speed.  

Nice block wargame, one because of simplicity of rules, can introduce gamers into the block wargaming genre.  Plays quickly, which is a bonus.

Much simpler than most block games, but much shorter as well.

Had [i]War of 1812[/i] been my first exposure to block games - rather than [i]Hammer of the Scots[/i] - I wouldn't be nearly as interested in the genre as I am now.  But I'm happy to play this old-timey classic despite its shortcomings, either with one of my kids or if I only have one adult-size opponent and 60-90 minutes to spare.

To be sure, I would have loved to discover a game like this (quick, fun) in the 1980s - if only I'd known of its existence.  Instead, I got stuck trying to ineffectively puzzle my way through Panzer Leader and Up Front.  Too bad.

Note: I still haven't tried the simultaneous movement, which may kick my interest in the game up a notch.  My suspicion is that the simo-move will be a big turn-off for the kids, which is why I haven't taken the plunge.

War of 1812 is too random for me, and not very deep for a Columbia Games' block wargame. This may work as a decent intro to block wargames with young children, but even then I'd go with a game that's more fun.

The fact that your starting blocks are random is of course great for speed of setup, but it can set you up for failure. I can sadly not find the fun in this game. Julius Caesar blew me away with how tense it is, and the War of 1812 underwhelmed me completely in this regard.

There are two things that bug me about Columbia's block wargames in general. First, the fact that you need to roll low to hit. Yes, this is minor as all heck, but it just feels wrong to root for low rolls, I cannot help it. 2nd, the combat system seems to reward defensive play, by allowing the defender to always roll first.

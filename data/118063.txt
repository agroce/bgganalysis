I'm conflicted.  The cards were pretty text-y, and the game seemed pretty unpredictable...but it was kinda fun.  The random setup should be great for replayability.  Good box size, too.  Just wish some of the cards and text weren't so damned small!

This game has a great idea and is very simple with simple rules and intelligent setup, but something doesn't feel right about this game, it is extremely hard to get inside the upper floors and still exit, with that said it is an Incan Gold with a bit more complex layers, but that doesn't work very well at all.

Rating after 1 game:

We all got caught but it was a lot of fun!  I liked it, a nice thematic feel to a largely card based game.  Players are cyberpunk raiders infiltrating corporate headquarters to steal data packets.  But it's not enough to get in and steal the data, you also have to get out before the cops arrive.  Loads of push your luck with an increasing pressure and competition in a light, enjoyable package.  Decisions are quick and intuitive but with a bit of take-that and trying to outguess other players.  Overall very enjoyable, light game that plays well in around 45 mins.  A game I would happily play again.

- Diamant does pretty much the same in less time
- There is really no point to use an action to lay down a card which slows down other players one turn, since you have to use one turn to lay down the card!?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
1p: pick multiple characters and when choosing data file to download, just don't look at them. At the end of them game flip them up and see who got most and try to beat the previous results.

A different approach: Put as many hidden DFs as the number of PCs you play on each face-down room.
e.g. : you play 2 PCs, after setup you place 2 face-down DFs on each room Play normally, but when you enter a room, remove those DFs. At the end of the game, you win if your DFs are worth more than the remaining DFs on face-down rooms. The DFs of eliminated PCs count against you.

The items made the game very "swingy".  If people are playing it quickly as a warmup, I'd be OK with it.  But I wouldn't anyone to be thinking/optimizing too much.

RATING: 6.8
Infiltration is a very pleasant game with a lot of re playability. It is short, fast and furious. It can also be played solo quite easily because there is no hidden mechanism. You can thus play with yourself and just try to break new records of Points on the long run.

There are some important unbalance though:

1. The 'wounded' status is far too penalizing because there is only 1 object card and 2 rooms which can cure the agents and it is not certain that any one of them appear during the game.
I still have to find a variant for this.

2. The game is uncooperative but some object cards are deliberately cooperative (i.e. the agent playing one such card can do nothing while helping other agents) and at the same time there are some other cards which hinder the other agents.
So may be this implies some negotiations during the game but it is too short for this to be very helpful and useful unless you are playing with altruist (and/)or masochist players.

Moreover, the whole concept is more than a bit weird. It is clearly a cyberpunk background but anyone who knows about cyberpunk environment knows that you don't have to be physically present to steal data because a cyberpunk setting is also about hacking from a remote location (i.e. like in the card game Netrunner).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A fantastic press-your-luck style game with a very fun and different theme. A lot of people have called this to Incan Gold and they are right. However Infiltration adds a lot more to think about turn to turn and feels like a more complete game than Incan Gold (no matter how much people like to overemphasize the psychological aspects in Incan Gold).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I really want to play this more before passing a verdict.  There is so much great story telling potential here.

You and your team of 3 or more are pressing your way deeper into the corporate structure.  The farther in you go the more valuable stuff you find.  The question is... how far do you push your luck?  Go for the big score and secure the win for sure with the chance of setting off the alarm and being caught?  Or do you get just enough to secure an upper middle of the road score and hope the rest of the team is eliminated?

[ESP] Buuuu, tenía muchas ganas de que me gustase este juego. Lo describen como un "diamantes" más sofisticado lo cual hubiese sido genial. Sin embargo la escaza posibilidad de recibir cartas adicionales hace a mi parecer que algunos afortunados jugadores posean demasiada ventaja sobre otros...
Por otro lado puede haber un jugador que logre recolectar muchísmos archivos pero sean todos de bajo valor, mientras que otro tenga suerte y recolecte solo un par de valor alto y gane. Definitivamente jugar mejor no implica ganar en este juego...

Liked it enough to request an instant replay after the first time.  I'd describe it as a cross between Diamant (Incan Gold?) and Netrunner.  You're a bunch of hackers, trying to get in and collect as many points as possible, and exit before the game ends.  Lots of variability, lots of provided variants, lots of fun if a bit wonky in collection mechanics.  Love the small box.  Definitely plan on getting a copy.

RATING: 6
The game play is not particularly new feeling and the game plays like something familiar - even to new players.  At the heart of the game is a push your luck mechanism.  It works to the extent that the game length is appropriate to the play.  What shines in the game is the Android universe.  The theme, and especially the artwork, harkens to the Android game and if that is of appeal, the game is likely to be received more favorably.  Without the theme, it's likely a 5 - 5.5 level game, but theme and production improve the overall reaction to the game.

At first, I thought "cyberpunk, must be good. Vaccarino, must be good." Well, not everything turns out that way. It seems that the best way to play is to explore four or so rooms in, and then high-tail out. Every time I've played, at least three people couldn't get out - and I rivaled them in terms of data acquired anyway. So basically, the winning strategy is "don't play the interesting bits"? Too many gambles in this game to be easily solved - although starting the track at -1 alarm is a good start.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I had heard a lot of negative buzz around this game before playing it so my expectations where quite low.  I actually enjoyed myself a lot more than I thought I would -- despite the fact that I offered up a pretty miserable performance.

Infiltration is essentially "Incan Gold" with some special powers.  Players are acting as members of a gang of robbers in a heist for information in the cyberpunk world of Fantasy Flight's Android universe.

I thought the game worked quite well really but I still prefer Incan Gold for this sort of experience.

This is just a horrifically bad game. At no point while playing this game will you make an interesting decision. This game has all the randomness of Yahtzee except with none of the fun of dice rolling. There are a bunch of rules to learn but none of them actually matter. It's strictly a vehicle for the theme and even the theme doesn't make a lot of sense. This game has no redeeming qualities except of course the FFG chrome. Sadly, a polished turd is still a turd.

Only redeeming quality of this game is that you can recognize how awful it is early on and hop out the exit, saving yourself from suffering through the rest of it.

I just don't like playing a game in which you have to read several cards, with tiny text on the board (probably reading them upside down), and then several cards in your hand.  Very, very, very unconfortable.  Gameplay also is not interesting for me, and depends too much on luck.
I do not even like the setting, but this is obviously a matter of taste.

This has been touted as "advanced" Incan Gold, and that is very accurate. Decide how far to go into the building to get data (treasure) before security busts everyone. The alternate rules which have each player start with separate equipment is a must, IMO. Raffle win at the 2012 Dice Tower Con.

Decent enough game.  Based on any particular characteristic, I would probably rate this a solid '6', but for some reason the combination of theme, mechanics, "impending doom," and semi-co-op elements raise this to a solid '7'.  

With the right group and greater familiarity, I could see individual sessions reaching an '8' rating, but many of the reasons that raise it from a '6' to a '7' for me are the same ones that keep it from ever rising higher than an '8' in my eyes (the limitations inherent in playing against the game that comes with semi-co-op, the clunkiness that seems accompany many games with strong popular themes, etc).

Overall, I liked the push your luck tension, but felt like the rules and mechanics were at times a tad too heavy for mechanism.  Again though, the package was good enough, as were the available choices and integration of theme.  

Also, variable character powers would have been a nice addition.

I like when I can feel the theme of a game while playing, and I love a good push-your-luck game. This one cleverly integrates the 2. Players are futuristic secret agents/spies who are breaking into a facility looking to download data files. The player who escapes with the most data wins. The way the different items allow you to break the rules makes a lot of sense thematically, the things you find in the rooms make logical sense based on the type of room, and more. Pretty much everything in this game was connected well with the theme. We played a game where 3 players easily had a chance of winning and it came down to how much data they had acquired. This was made more interesting because 2 of these 3 players almost didn't make it out of the facility (just barely slipped out using the Executive Elevator.) I loved the fact that the alarm escalates faster and faster, keeping the game fairly quick. I can't say all the reasons why, but I really enjoyed this game, and my father and I found ourselves talking about it for hours afterwards. The only downside I've noticed so far is that the items aren't exactly balanced, so some players might start with a disadvantage based on the items they were dealt at the beginning. I probably should also mention that there are a lot of opportunities to mess with your opponents, so you have to go in expecting that. Thin skins need not apply.

Interesting push-your-luck game with a lot of random set up that could keep it interesting.  I could see playing this again with gamers, but I'm not sure it would be great over a ton of plays.  It felt like a game from Donald and that's mostly a good thing.

This is a fun "press-your-luck" game with some good player interaction. The random card layout makes for good replayability with unpredictable results.

Surprisingly good, even as a two-player game. The cyberpunk theme is captured much better than in Netrunner, IMO, and the table talk can make it downright hilarious. I like that the rooms are set up randomly, but if you know the cards well enough, you can really push your luck to go far into the building. The item cards are crazy powerful, and allow you to set up some amazing combos. I wish there were more ways to get them in the game, though. An expansion would be awesome!

A very luck based game with meaningless decisions.  Regardless of what you decide to do on a turn (download, advance, etc.) your destiny is decided by blind draw with no mitigation strategy.  Too bad because I liked the theme and was hoping it would be a good game.

Play tip: the game is probably shorter than you'd expect. It'll be tough to get to the 2nd level without special powers, unless the alarm levels stays unexpectedly low.

Anyway, Infiltration is not bad - more or less the right length, right box size, right price. And it actually has a coherent theme! After what seemed like an outright contempt for theme on display in Dominion and Kingdom Builder, that's nice to see. Typical problematic FFG production though - ludicrously tiny fonts, bad rules, an overall terrible physical design - although the graphics and use of color are actually pretty nice.

One thing to watch for: the extraction optional rule (which replaced Download) is a better rule but has some odd timing implications. You can't use an item card to extract then move the way you could download then move - extract takes place in the location you end in, while download takes place wherever you actually play it. It does not seem that it should be beyond the wit of man to write a more intuitive rule, but it might require you to remember where you played the card, and FFG doesn't like you to need to remember any kind of state.

Don't use it the first time out, but after you've played once or twice you'll almost certainly want to use the drafting items optional rule.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Infiltration is a somewhat interesting little game of navigating a building, trying to beat other players to scoring opportunities.

Basically, each turn you play a card which dictates your action for the turn, and you carry out that action.  You action may be as simple as moving to another room, or you might interact with the room in some way.  Each room has different ways to interact with it, so in some rooms you might be able to score points in various ways, or you might be able to do something else, like draw more equipment cards (which let you do more stuff) or mess with other players in some way.

Each turn, the threat of the game ending comes nearer, and you must decide when to bolt for the exit before the game ends.  If you don't escape before the game ends, you lose no matter how many points you've scored.

Overall, a neat game with a little push-your-luck aspect to it.  Suitable for a longer filler game.

A chromy Diamant game. Stay or go is still the question, but it plays out differently here. The better rooms are deeper in the building, but the deeper you go, the harder it is to get out on time. The question is also, often, do I stay and collect this bounty, letting others get to the deeper rooms first, or do I abandon this treasure to the others in order to get to the deeper rooms first.

There is a lot of uncertainty in this game. How quickly the cops show up, is to some extent determined by a six sided die rolled every turn. What cards do the others have in their hands. What rooms are in the game (only a segment of the potential rooms are actually in play in any given game). And then, on top of all this, you make decisions simultaneously with the others.

The game's biggest flaw, for me, is the chrome. I'm not convinced that it makes the game more fun to play, and it definitely makes it harder to teach, and during play, the reading of all the rooms and cards takes up time I'd rather spend on playing the game.

Played it once and felt there wasn't much to this game. It is absurdally short and leaves really little space for decisions - the ones it offers are pretty straighforward. There's almost no intraction either, might as well play it alone. Also maybe the push-your-luck aspect is not my thing, but game seemed straight random (DF tokens range from 1 to 3 VP, that alone makes the game random as hell). I also have problems with the card balance... some of them are well useless, while others offer VP and extra moves.

On the plus side, game is really beautiful and thematic. The aspect I really enjoyed was how you feel the time running. But that mechanic has a drawback: when you know at some point that you won't make it to the exit in time, you might as well leave the table. 

To sum up, I think that this game (along with Kingdom Builder and Nefarious) was pushed from Vaccarino's drawer, unpolished and unfinished. I felt that it's modular nature and variability was to make up for the creative spark and a lot of testing here.

It is first and foremost a push your luck game, but with enough little decisions to make it interesting along the way other than a simple "stay or go" decision.

There's plenty of randonmess in the room effects, card draws, etc. but what's the point of a push your luck game without the randonmess? You don't want to have the ability to "math out" the end game condition! I admire the fact that the rooms are modular, and 1/3 of the rooms (or more?) stay in the box. This nicely boosts up replayability.

In our first play, we all died, clearly staying in the building way too long. Some familiarity of the possible rooms is important, but the group expressed a willingness to try this game again.

Kind of fun. Push your luck games should have tension. Somehow, implementing the theme sucked a bit of that out of the game...or maybe I just played it a handful of times and was kind of done with the discovery phase. It was received fairly well locally, but after a handful of plays I think we were all kind of finished with it. 

That's probably good value for a game of this price, but I also think maybe its just a tad disappointing.

RATING: 6
It is fun and surprisingly fast. I'm in love with the Android universe so this game had an advantage. It met the expectation. I have one negative point towards the game:
I believe if you don't modify the rules or manipulate the deck going through the 2nd floor is a suicide mission and/or makes the 2nd part of the game a boring 'retreat' festival.

Update from 7 to 6:
I had a very strange 2 minute game (we didn't cheat or anything I just could force both of my enemies out of the building and won in the 2nd round). This is not good and I think this game could be great with an expansion but it won't happen sadly and I feel I'll be done with than base game sooner than expected.

Enjoyable, but very fiddly with lots of little tokens and cards and such.  For a fairly short game, set-up can take a bit.  Doesn't seem to be a whole lot of variation from play to play right now, the thief who tags behind the others and cleans up the first floor seems to have the best chance to escape and win, rushing and raiding the second floor just doesn't seem worth it.

This was a fair bit of fun for a quick game.  The theme and the pace are good, but after a few games I suspect that this is only an occasional game as the variety of the cards means that you feel like you are telling the same story over again, and players get a bit too conservative about how far in they go.

On the one hand, I have to give this game credit for having a good theme, beautifully done art, and a smart premise.  The problem is it's just not that much fun.  Move ahead or back.  Collect data, or do a special action.  Get lucky with having the right item cards and surge into the lead.  And escape in time, or your whole escapade was a waste.

While I'd give this game another go if asked - I wouldn't request it myself and I certainly don't need to own it.

Филлер для хардкорщиков, которые хотят немного расслабить мозг перед чем-то эпичным. Задумка хорошая, время партии небольшое, выбор действий и очередность хода интригует - всегда пытаешься разгадать что сыграет человек, сидящий перед тобой, хотя зачастую его действия и очевидны. Но в игре недостает глубины, есть некие претензии к механике - ходить на "второй этаж" это практически верный проигрыш. Слишком рискованно, поэтому добрая половина игровых компонентов как бы и не сильно нужна.

A press your luck game with a theme attached.  It has the usual FFG rulebook, by which I mean confusing, haphazard, and clear as mud.  My one play on this I won by the simple expedient of throwing a mild tantrum and retreating out early so I didn't have to keep playing.  Only 1 other player made it out, and I actually scored more than he did, so I ended up winning - by accident.  Not high on my list of wanting to play again.

RATING: 5
Players are infiltrators, breaking into a high security complex, and stealing data.  Players simultaneously choose an action, and reveal in player order.  Actions are to advance or retreat down a line of cards, representing twelve rooms of the complex.  As a new room is entered, it's revealed and effects are applied.  Other actions are to download data from the current room (randomly draw VP chits), or "interface" with the room to activate some sort of room function.  Player order rotates around the table, which leads to thoughtful game play and consideration of timing issues.  The idea is to get in, grab some points, and get out, before the game clocks expires - yes, think Dungeonquest!  This is a fun game, perhaps a little heavy on the luck due to the random VP chit draws and uneven powers in the items deck.  Still, plays out fast enough.  Production is the usual Fantasy Flight train wreck - art that is way too busy and teeny, tiny fonts.  Happy to play it again.

Wouldn't mind a few more plays of this, as the learning game was rough.   It is essentially "Advanced Incan Gold", and that's fine...  seems like there is space for such a game.   The graphics are nice, but the physical presentation is a bit clumsy and difficult to deal with.   Game is much shorter than it seems like it will be.   Items are powerful and I like the idea of the variant which drafts them to begin with.   The re-playability should be pretty good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Infiltration came so close to being great, but just felt off in the pacing. With hints of DungeonQuest there is the same flaw where sometimes the best strategy is to go in a few rooms, grab just a little bit of treasure then bolt banking on everyone else losing due to staying too long. But that strategy doesn't make for an exciting game. The issue with Infiltration is that by the time you make it up to the second level it feels like it is time to bolt. Better pacing would have that feeling hit a few rooms into the second layer. Fun, simple and exciting, but feels like it needed just a few more moments in the oven to fully bake.

To me this felt like a somewhat neutered Dungeonquest. I love Dungeonquest but less so this. Its far more forgiving (no insta death - boo) and accessible and gives turn by turn tactical decisions. I've only played one game, but it felt a little to deterministic. I almost always new what action my opponents had selected based on their game position and it quickly became apparent that short a lot of luck i was too far behind the curve to catch up the leaders. 
It is however a good light game with a reasonably immersive theme, and ease of play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Beautiful artwork, but you'll see the best artwork recycled in Android: Netrunner.

Other than that: a luck based game, where winning and losing are determined by the whimsy of 1.) cards laid down and 2.) turn order.

Turn order can seriously screw you over, and there's nothing you can do about it.

Unique powers come in the form of one-shot tools and items. You're generally advised to get more of these - but again, it's totally luck based whether you get anything useful.

Ironically, this game could probably be played by a computer. The decisions are easy and the tactical space is immediate, it's just way too luck driven to be fun.

Played twice.  Our first play was ruined by a random setup, meaning that players that took an early branch dominated the game.  The second play was better... The game at it's heart is very simple, and should be played fast.  Be careful not to bog yourself down in the FFG presentation -- although nice, there's a lot of pieces on the table, and that tends to "trick" the players into taking more time to think than they need to.

I can see the attempt at a little push your luck game with a sci-fi theme but the cards seemed half-baked. Some were great and some were really lame. Only a small opportunity for combinations to mitigate the luck of the draw. A game like this depends on the slickness of the combinations one can pull off and there just wasn't enough. Either give me wild, game-breaking cards that allow me to do some crazy powerful stuff or give me less randomness. This ends up in the dreaded middle ground. I still think Incan Gold does this genre in a more entertaining way. The small fonts used were a minor annoyance.

Lots of randomness in this one. Some item cards are superior to others, which makes luck of the draw even more unbalanced. 

I played two two-player (two operatives each) game, and while we didn't use the Extraction card, it seems really overpowered and forces you to move and download as quickly as you can, with no other option, because if you fall behind, every room you come to is going to be empty by the time you get to it.

All in all, it was a 'cute' game, but the replayability of this one may be on the low side. There aren't many games where I think an expansion would be a lot of fun, but this is one of those. I guess FFG has that market niche carved out pretty well!

Rating based on one game - using standard rules and set up (I'm told some of the expanded items or scenarios make it better).  A clever theming of a "push your luck" game with lots of "chrome" for finish but ultimately I probably prefer a simpler, more abstract style of a "push your luck" game.

Interesting push your luck game set in the android netrunner universe.

Each room has datafiles (VP tokens in) but it is null and void if you do not get out of the building once the alarm reaches 99. Items can give you boosts and add or subtract from the alarm rate and thus you can never be sure just how much time you actually have left.

RATING: 8
Fairly random and chaotic, but since it's a light and short game that's definitely part of the fun. The strategy will come from trying to figure out what the other players will do (especially if they're in the same room as you) and how turn order can effect that. Plans can get ruined when you think someone will extract data files in a room, so you try to interface, but they end up doing the same and go before you, so you just wasted your turn. Also, you need to know when to make your escape, or if you should just push forward and hope for another way out.
For the people who bring up the strategy of just grabbing a couple files, then escaping immediately hoping everyone else gets caught inside: who are you playing with!? I can't imagine I'd like to play any game with anyone who just wants to win at all costs; sacrificing theme and fun. In my group, if we saw anyone just hanging out near the entrance and planning an escape after a couple of turns, that person would be taunted mercilessly. If they still followed through and  left very early they would be made fun of the rest of the game night. No one would care that they won.

Infiltration is a push-your-luck game in the same vein as Diamant or Incan Gold but with lots of chrome. It's not a bad attempt at creating a more sophisticated entry in the genre but I still think it falls a little short. While the thematic integration is pretty nice it is a little too long and convoluted for its own good, especially since the aspect of pushing your luck only really comes into play towards the end of the game. The cards and special effects are also somewhat too tame to allow for gambles of the life-or-death kind.

The wall of text on the cards is quite a barrier to entry for new players, even though the card effects are typically simple enough to sink in quickly.

Definitely a game that runs mostly on push-your-luck and randomness, but there is enough theme and mechanics worked into this game that make it feel like a full experience. Players have definite control over what random effects they wish to tease and that adds to the theme of breaking into a high-security facility with security guards pushing in. This is a game for those who like push-you-luck games but wanted something a little meatier than "Incan Gold", which actually makes this a good game for me. In Infiltration, you'll feel more of the risk than the random.

Rating might go up, I've only played 3 games since I got it. It SEEMS like there's a lot of potential here - but I can't tap into that potential yet, and I can't tell if it's because I need to be better at the game, or because the mechanics aren't as fleshed out as they should be. I came into it expecting a lot of player interaction, I was kind of disappointed in the fact that there are only very subtle ways to mess with your teammates/opponents, and such opportunities only arise every once in a while. If the players are in the same room, then it becomes tricky to decide what to do during your turn, since everyone chooses their actions simultaneously and in secret- and often, something in a room can only be used once. There's the occasional bluffing here, and some guesswork as to what the players before you are going to do, but often people will just try to spread out and have a room all to themselves.

The game has some interesting aspects. I especially like the NPCs. A particularly amusing interaction with an NPC was when one spawned in a room right next to the executive elevator. This particular NPC moves one room a round in order to try to reach an exit, and once they do, they up the security tracker by 20, which is an impressive amount. So as soon as this NPC spawned, she moved, exited the building, and brought about an incredibly premature rush to the exits.

Another great story arose from when I used a card that allows you to move to the next room and use that room's "interact" feature. The room hadn't been explored yet, but since 99% of the interact events would have helped me out at that point, I figured it was worth getting a jump on the other players. I stumbled blindly into the room, and the interact feature in this case was an incinerator - damage your player in order to have them grab something out of the discard pile. There was nothing in the discard pile as yet, so my character fell into the incinerator, took damage, and was slowed for the rest of the game (as I couldn't find a medical room or a first aid item).

Such moments, however, are rare. Mostly, this game is a fairly straight-forward push-your-luck dungeon run with very few meaningful decisions to make. It might just be because we're still learning the finer poins of the game, but there's little drama or tension to really make the experience sing. It's short, easy to learn, and really pulls off the theme well, but don't expect a deep experience. 

Edit: The more people playing, the better.

The best version, so far, of the classic 'dungeon run': run in to grab as many treasures as you can before the cave collapses.
Nice futuristic theme, good quality cards and tokens, easy rules, yet enough variation to make the game interesting through severals plays.

Fun press your luck element. It's a fairly simple game, and luck plays a large role, but there's enough strategy to keep me interested in each turn. A variety of interesting card combinations and interactions are possible. Turn order is extremely important.

I like the Android universe, so the theme works for me.

It's playable with two, but more fun with more. I thought four players worked really well.

Honestly speaking, this is one of those games that can have better rating when I play this more. So far I've played this once, and although the game has some potential and interesting things going on, I didn't really get to know the game yet, the ending especially was quite unimpressive. Theme is also a double-edged sword for this one: I've got nothing against sci-fi in itself, but the game about some thieves hacking computer systems and stealing data isn't exactly for me. I mean if you would use the same system with different setting, like for example a story about a bank heist, it would work better I think. But like I said, I will definitely give this another go. It has potential.

RATING: 5
(12/18/2014) Comment based on one play of the basic game.

Leave it to FFG to muck up a straightforward, push-your-luck game like Inca Gold, bloating it with mind-numbingly trivial mechanics, random bells and whistles, and blinding chrome, turning it into a boring, pointless, and meaningless exercise.

The object is to gather up as much Data File (DF) tokens, each which has a random VP value of 1 to 3 points (totally luck of the draw), before the alarm counter reaches 99. The alarm counter is jacked up each player turn by a 1D6, plus some "alarm" level that keeps going up as rooms are revealed.

Turn order seems to be important here, where whomever is lucky enough to go first is going to have first access at the DF tokens and first to get out. There is no provision to compensate for lateness in the turn order. DF tokens are scattered through a number of hidden "room" cards that are revealed in sequence, with each having a random number of DF tokens, and varying arrangements of "locks", "interfaces", and NPCs.

Unlike Inca Gold, where your choice is staying or going, you have several more options besides advancing or retreating one room at a time, and this choice is made secretly and simultaneously through choosing one of four action cards, which are recycled back into your hand at the end of your turn. The players also start with a small hand of "tools", that can be played in-lieu of the action cards, each which happens to break a rule or give some advantage to a player or help hinder other players.

As one of your other choices, you could stay and "download" a DF token (two, if you're first in the current round), or you could "interface" with the room, unlocking some potential goodies. There also may be "locks", which can only be destroyed with "tools", which happen to provide more DF tokens to a given room. There may also be NPCs that happen to hinder the players' advance through the various rooms.

Within minutes, all of this seemed to be a rehash of the various simple mechanics of other FFG games, like Arkham Horror and Dungeonquest, turning a simple push-your-luck concept, into a overly complicated jumble of stuff. What especially bothered me was waiting for everyone to go through and complete their one extremely trivial action. With five players, it seemed like an eternity for the action to come around to me, do something for 5 seconds, and then to wait another eternity. FFG's AH and BSG are equally guilty of this--the flow of play sucks. It reminded me of the lack of meaningful play and lack of sophisticated design of the other titles, hoping that no one will realize the banefully trivial design that lies beneath the gloss and high-tech artistry.

It is a "5", with plenty of room to go down quickly. I don't see myself ever playing this game ever again. Why, I ask, when there are so many better designs out there today? With this game, I am beginning to lose respect for FFG--purveyors of chrome offering little substance.

UPDATE:  So far half the games have been hilarious FUBAR heists where:

• Everyone gets in slap-fights over the best Wi-Fi hot spots

• Someone finds out that while next year's Luv-Luv Bot™ model is only five-foot-three and cute as hell it weighs [i]more than 350 pounds[/i] and reverse-cowgirls like a pile driver, no, [i]really[/i]

• Most everyone gets shot in the leg

• One lucky bastard makes it out to the rainslick parking lot where he/she/it hotwires the minivan (because Mr. White—[i]God rest his soul[/i]—had the keys), and lays rubber onto the frontage road just in time to see the security merc APC get air off some parked cars and skid sideways across the wet asphalt, all six riot tires locked up—[i]making the slowpokes in the lobby dolly-zoom as they crap their pants[/i]—and ram the building in a shower of glass and gore...

And the other half have been completely dull.

The random factor means that when this baby gels it sets up hard and sweaty, and when it doesn't it's boring as hell.  I'm gonna call it a 6.

UP-UPDATE:  Because this game hinges on the random factor lining up [i]just so[/i]**, the variants where (1) each character starts with two preset item cards and (2) the card drafting mechanism for item selection [i]absolutely kill[/i] what makes this game work (some of the time).  If you know which items are in play, there are no outrageous surprises... and that's really all the game has going for it in the end.  Much better to have everyone start with four unknown bits of gear.  Only then can true hilarity ensue (some of the time).

[size=7]**A high alarm count combined with high proximity rolls, as well as synergistic item cards.[/size]

[b]The Final Dissonant Note:[/b]  Word is this was originally a game about children sneaking into a Wonka-esque candy factory—knowing that suddenly makes some of the null/weird elements almost make sense—but FFG wanted to cram the wooden shoe of their "rich, vibrant" [i]Android[/i] IP into the gears.  Let the result be a lesson to us all.

I must admit, looking at the components for this game I had pretty low expectations - it seemed far too overproduced for my tastes and the theme didn't really do much for me.  However, I was definitely surprised by how much fun I had with this game.  The game has all the trappings of a co-op game (different characters, movement through a nefarious building with hazards aplenty), except that the cooperation has been replaced by backstabbing and screwage.  At heart it's basically a press your luck game (how much can you get away with and still get out safely), but the variety of special room powers and items makes it a delightfully fun exercise to figure out how much you can screw other people over without screwing yourself over.  My main issues with the game are the large amounts of text on the room cards (kind of a pain especially if there are a lot of people crowded around the table) and the difficulty in getting items, as these are what really make the game fun.  All in all a very enjoyable game, one I look forward to playing again.

Android: Infiltration is short, fast and fun, and it hits my personal sweet spot of straightforward mechanics and strong theming. You get pretty much exactly the experience promised on the box: a mini-Shadowrun cyberpunk heist movie, where you and your fellow lowlifes are strictly allies of convenience and the best option is often to just run, run, run away as fast as you can. 

It's one of those games that makes for fun stories afterward, and you can play multiple times in an evening, or use it as an entree to something else, which is a huge plus in my book.

Great fun game.
The theme is fabulous and the narrative is splendid.
Plenty of great time for those accepting games in which optimization doesn't play a central role and you might not be in full control of your fate.  Randomness?  Yeah, for sure, in many ways.  But it's not a mindless games.  You have to think, predict and calculate the risks just enough.  But above all, who cares about randomness when the there's so much laughter and happy faces around the table? :D

Absolutely perfect base for countless expansions.

[Now I can clearly see the distinct feature of Vaccarino's game designing idea: a replayability.  That seems to be his no. 1 priority.  And that's absolutely fine with me.  I _demand_ good replayability in games.]

EDIT: Despite fun ideas - not always fulfilling  plus it starts to get somewhat repetitive after a dozen of plays... A rating down to 7.

RATING: 5
Random setup means it really needs more that one play before it can get a fair assessment.  There are a number of rooms lined up, and each player had a token that starts at the beginning.  You're trying to explore the rooms, grab the stuff, and get out.  Notwithstanding theme, the stuff is just tokens worth 1-3 points, which value is hidden until the end.  Only those who escape participate in end game scoring; you can go out the way you came in or through an alternate exit that may be on one of the randomly-selected room cards.  Each round, someone rolls a die and adds a modifier to advance an "alarm".  The game ends when the alarm reaches 99.  Update: It feels like a lot of times you don't have control over how you do.  Sometimes, it just comes down to guessing what your opponent(s) will do and doing something different.  Sometimes, there's just nothing useful you can do.  If you get hurt, you may or may not be able to find a means to cure yourself.

Initial Rating: 6.0

Two things attracted me to try this game. 1. I thought the game was hugely thematic, however I didn’t feel the theme throughout my first play, It can be that I`m unfamiliar with the Android universe but the game has some theme at least (pasted on theme).  2. It is a game from Donald X. Vaccarino, as I love Dominion, I was keen to play his other games. 

As soon as the game was explained to me, DungeonQuest popped into mind, because in both games you need to escape with your treasure (information) before the dungeon (building) closes down. However, both games have very different mechanics.

Infiltration can be a fun game with the right crowd. For me, Infiltration is more a gateway game with party-ish tones.  Lots of opportunities to screw your opponents and also lots of luck with the rooms, with your personal items, with the amount of information of your chips and with the countdown clock. Fortunately, the game is short enough for me, so I can ignore the luck factor and have some fun with it. The rules are fairly simple, and the art is adequate.

It seems that getting to the highest rooms is very hard, if you intend to escape in time. :devil:

As with Dominion, it appears the game has a lot of replayability as you only play with 12 random rooms each play AND it matters where in the complex these 12 rooms are, so each game will be different.

On the bad side, I feel the player order in each turn has a huge effect on the game. The first players have an unfair advantage as they will have more turns playing first than the last players AND playing first in a round is a HUGE advantage if you are sharing a room.

Definitively, Infiltration is not a game to take seriously, it has more luck than I’m comfortable with so the best player won`t win most of the time, still it can a fun game. Not a game to play every week, but I will play it again.

As I have played a lot of Android: Netrunner lately, my second play of Infiltration was more enjoyable. Now I was able to feel more of the theme. It excited me to recognize some names and art that the two games share. 

This is not a game to play very often, but now I want to buy it. It is a fun game with the right game group.

Move through the facility with action cards and dowload as many files as possible.

Perfectly serviceable, fine push-your-luck card(ish) game elevated by the amazing use of the Android license and theme. Cards do an amazing (and surprisingly funny)job of illustrating the theme. All around a good time. Would probably rate this higher, it just doesn't get to the table a lot.

This game is very thematic.  I didn't expect it to be but it is. It is a press your luck game that works well 2-4. I like the 2 player rules that allow you to have 2 characters.  My son used this device to have one of his characters take the fall so the other could escape, and be the only one to do so.  Decisions, plenty. Go forward, go back. break locks knowing others might take the loot, when to push, when to leave, do you risk moving so far away from the exit?  And what do you do if there's a runaway leader? How about sabotage the escape route and be the only player to leave. I've seen this done in games.  I like the setting and the heist theme, it's there.  Nice and lite game with interesting card/equipment combos.

RATING: 7
Simultaneous action selection, a gamer's Diamant. Each room has individual features and various ways to interact with. Players can play item cards instead of the generic actions. Being out of the facility before the guards approach is harder than it seems as the proximity dial progresses faster and faster.

Infiltration succeeds in telling a story. It's random, luck is needed to get the right items, players will get hosed by other players' actions. Nonetheless, clever moves are possible and between equally lucky players skill and the right amount of push-your-luck decide.

A fun game with some usability issues. The small text on the room cards is difficult to read, especially upside down and the rooms have too many functions to remember them all. As long as players are not familiar with the game, plays can drag a bit too long.

A decent if not earth-shattering press-your-luck game with a cyberpunk theme, Infiltration is a pretty good time and doesn't seem to overstay its welcome. The variability of the room cards adds some replayability; however, that comes at the expense of not really having any idea whether, as in my first play, there would be multiple ways to exit the complex, even from the top floor or, as in my second play, there would be no getting out except through the entry room. If you can live with that kind of random, onto which is added random item draws, then this game's not a bad time.

RATING: 5
Once of those cool and strong theme, but mediocre game. The game is pretty much decided at the beginning as soon as you receive your item cards, the rest of the time, you're simply working out the mechanic. 

Half the cards have a very specific usage, and most if not all the time they are useless other than to provide you a fake sense of variety.

Not quite sure how anyone ever gets all the way into the building!!  The Proximity Dial accelerates so quickly (even when it is going slowly) that I can't imagine getting to the other side and back without a secret exit.  I'm not that lucky so I never tried to go past the first 6 rooms.  Still interesting though gathering data and using special cards to accomplish the most you can.

RATING: 5
Push-your-luck game where you advance along a track acquiring points and, while a timer ticks down, ask yourself whether you have more points than any other player who's likely to exit and bank theirs. If so, you move to bank yours, otherwise you're forced to continue. And then the random appearance or non-appearance of additional exits throws all your considerations off. In my first game I was blindsided by the steadily accelerating threat dial and there were some rule goofs, so I'm not sure how much control you actually have. Some kind of initial draft might help, since the item cards seem to represent the chief (if limited) opportunity to break out of the pack.

Really solid game.  Built around a "Race as far as you can then get out before the stroke of midnight" mechanic.  Simple game play, easy to learn and teach, plays relatively quickly.  

The fact that it takes place in the net runner universe didn't help or hurt the game for me.  I thought this would work just as well as a stand alone title, but if it brings more people to the table, that's great.

Love the setting and concept. But too many aspects work against the cool premise. Like casually strolling out one room at a time when the alarm is going nuts. Like rarely having enough time to climb to the 2nd floor and still escape, so you don't bother going up, even though it's a game about raiding an office TOWER. Frustrating.

First game, two-players.
Several things to keep in mind - the alert level escalates rapidly during (roughly) the second half, do not remove Interface tokens unless the instructions say so (it is not automatic), NPC effects can be very damaging. 
I think we'll enjoy it more now that we've made the usual dog's breakfast of the first game.

Neat theme, I had fun.  I would play again.  Our game ran a bit long (45 minutes).  Probably playable in 20-30 minutes with experienced players (and no teaching).

A simultaneous action selection/press your luck game set in the Android universe. Players are operatives attempting to get into a corporate facility and download data. Players must balance how much data they've downloaded with how likely it is they are to be caught inside the facility. Each round everyone selects an action and carries it out in turn order. Players may advance and go into the facility more, retreat and get back out of the facility, interface with the rooms they're in doing various abilities as depicted in the room, download data from the room, or play an item card in their hand. The items are all over the place and range from very good to borderline useless in many situations. The game has a very nice psychological element and a good pacing element with timing it just right to make your move when you have position on other players. That being said, it ultimately falls flat for me and just doesn't seem like it has that much substance. There are far better press your luck/action selection games out there. If you want to combine both elements though give it a whirl, you might just be surprised by this one.

The layout of the complex is different every game, choosing 6 of the possible 18 first floor cards, 6 of the 18 second floor cards, and 1 of the 3 secret room cards. These rooms are revealed to the players over the course of the game, usually by one of the players entering the room. The rooms contain traps, NPCs, valuable data and items, and even secret exits.

Each turn, players secretly choose actions they will take, then in turn reveal and resolve their actions. Advancing into the complex or retreating towards the exit, downloading valuable data, interfacing with the current room, or using an item are the actions available to players. After the players have had their turn, any active NPCs have a turn, then the proximity dial is increased. Once the dial reaches 99, or all players have left the complex, the game ends. The players who have escaped the complex add up the value of the data they have extracted; the highest value wins!

Played once, 6p.  Ok, this is Diamant/Incan Gold, but each room has special effects, and players have special items that can break the rules.  Since each successive room totally changes the game state, I saw little real reason to plan much in this game.  Essentially, I moved forward when I could, taking points when it looked like I could.  Not a terrible game, but not my type of game either.  If it was a bit shorter, I would probably be more willing to play again, but as it stands, I'm not super interested in playing again.

**Disclaimer - This is based off a demo play at GenCon**

While I didn't hate my play of Infiltration, I can't say that I enjoy it either. Maybe with further plays I can see the score possibly going up, and most likely never going down. The mechanics are pretty unique, I can't think of a single game that is simliar to Infiltration, and that is a good thing. Pretty simple mechanics, everyone chooses an action for the round at the same time, and then each player in turn order takes that action. Get out with the most data and you win. But getting out might be the difficult part.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Mechanics reminded me of Knizia's semi-co-operative Hobbit (to which I was recently introduced), but with a much greater screw-over factor.  As long as the group keeps the social dynamic light, I think that's a great addition!

High level of replayability from the variety of rooms & items, with more players making the game somewhat less ordered, and feeling more tactical than strategic as things can change so quickly.  All in all, a good quick playtime with a reasonable amount to consider.

I read a review of this game and thought, "Huh, I'd like to try that out!" And then that very night, my friend Jim brought his new copy to game night! So I'm kind of using the power of The Secret. Anyhow, this sounded like DungeonQuest in the future, with a little more player interaction. Sadly, it's just not as much fun as DQ. The linear nature of the facility, while I'm sure designed to maximize player conflict and minimize headaches for managing NPCs, just makes everyone race to clean out a room. The tech lock and lab worker things are weirdly done too: you can't do them without proper items, so those with lucky item card draws only get the options, yet unlocking/killing them may benefit other players more, so even then you might not want to do it. So it's a game about infiltrating an enemy base in which you're mostly just slap-fighting the members of your own team. There's a decent game in here, but it doesn't quite come together in a meaningful way. Starting to think DXV just isn't a designer for me. UPDATE: This game would make way more sense as a co-op.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Nice filler however there are a couple of bad things about this game. Turn order seems very important. Having certain equipment cards can give you a big edge early. This is a problem with any game that has a deck with all unique cards.
The game isshort enough that this doesn't take away the fun. However i rather play diamant or another push your luck game than this.
And what is with all the DF tokens? Way too small andthey all have to be turned over before the game start. A bag would not work because you need to have them favedown coming out on the cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun, fast-paced press-your-luck game with a cyberpunk flair. My only issue with it is that it feels like they expect the game to be a little less fast than it is; there are items and cards in there that would be great for certain tactical approaches that you often don't have time for. Indeed, I sometimes feel like there are only two real strategies that work here - play conservative and never go past the first floor, or streak up to the second floor and hope. Any amount of waffling can screw you out of victory. That said, we have not played with any advanced rules, so maybe the items make more sense in that context, and it's possible the strategy opens up in that arena, too. Definitely recommended as a light game for a group of serious gamers who won't take competition too personally.

You're pulling off the biggest data heist of the century, but your allegiance to your crew only goes past the front door. Once you and up to 5 other members have infiltrated the company, anything goes to see who can steal the most data and escape from the facility before security arrives.

If you wanted this game to be a cross between Dominion and Android, you need to learn how to do research.

Infiltration fills a neat niche as a brief yet thematic push-your-luck game.  What should be its selling point (variety of rooms) actually works against it (the rooms aren't diverse enough).  The game would be better with more distinct player characters, more diverse rooms, and strong team rules.  However, it succeeds in its narrative, the secret room mechanic, and the NPC mechanic.  It's a good game, but be aware of what you're getting.

So... in the proper phase you choose one of four actions: Advance, Retreat, Search the Room or Loot. And you have to get out with the most gold before the dragon seals the only exit and eats you all... I guess I'd like this in the traditional fantasy setting :-|

Can't wait to play it properly, but after a single three-player game I'm getting ready to be rather disappointed :(

Update 06.10.12: Yeah, I've seen a single six-player game of it being played, I've played a second, four-player game today and I'm pretty sure I already know enough to write this game off as a half-baked, unpolished mediocre game. It just doesn't work very well. Very random, with very little saving grace in its mechanisms, and a terrible end-game. The push-your-luck element is very poorly implemented, and the nature of the board makes each game entirely unpredictable and luck-based. It was pretty lame with all player numbers I've seen and I've yet to see players playing it actually enjoying it.

A great disappointment - the production values are high, the game looks great, but the nice components can't save a design that Vaccarino must've taken out of an old drawer labeled "Unfinished projects". I'd love to love it, but if it will hit the table once in a blue moon, that's it, I'm afraid :(

EDIT 26.05.2016 - traded it off.

Strengths: the tension from pushing your luck as the alarm dial escalates, and the hidden action selection which leads to plenty of mind games.

Infiltration is a heavily thematic scifi game with interesting gameplay mechanics. 

Players can use wide variety of items and special powers to gain advantage in the race to gain most points before escaping the facility. Every turn you are forced to make decision whether you should try to explore one more room or turn around and head for the exit. 

The theme may put off some people, but every player in my group who has tried Infiltration, has enjoyed this game.

This is more swingy and luck-driven than I expected, but it's not a long game; it doesn't outstay its welcome, but it does feel too random. In both games I've played, the winner got very lucky -- once because of fantastic items and a perfect starting room, and once because I played a card that put them in an amazing position to win. Luck wasn't the only factor, but it was decisive.

The components are fantastic, the mechanics are fun, and the cyberpunk feel is captured well. I love the tension of trying to predict what the other players will do every turn, and the need to balance my plans with "conditions on the ground."

Ultimately I decided it wasn't likely to get table time again and sold it.

Infiltration is a weird kind of game. A cyberpunk setting, a press-your-luck style gameplay, all wound up in a heist story. Set in the same universe as Android: Netrunner, Infiltration features a team of players on a mission out of Shadowrun. 

Your mission is to break into a corporation building, steal as much data as possible, and escape for security forces arrive. Each move must be a calculated risk. Do you charge ahead of your competitors to access deeper (and more lucrative) rooms while risking not being able to get out in time? Do you play it safe for a more modest score but guaranteed escape?

It's good fun.

Wow, Vaccarino really hit inspiration with Dominion. Since then, he's produced a bunch of okay stuff which seems to have sold based on the success of his biggie.

My 6.5 for Infiltration is based on two-player only. If there are more than 2, I rate it a 4. It's just too easy to do all the work for the other players if there are more than two because you only get a single agent each. I know all the other players are in the same boat, but that doesn't make it any less frustrating. With two players, each gets two agents which can be tag-teamed, and this makes for a much more satisfactory game.

It's still not a favourite, and it is a bit style-over-substance, but it's pretty good with two, inviting multiple plays at a single sitting.

I had almost zero expectations of this, good or bad, going in to my first play and was pleasantly surprised by it.  I tend to enjoy simultaneous action selection and it works great here.  The game also does a very good job of encouraging players to spread out a bit, but you still need to pay close attention to what others are doing and try to anticipate their moves.  The pace is good and the overall play time is quick (45 minutes or so).  I also appreciate the low learning curve -- getting new players up to speed with the standard actions is pretty simple.  The randomness of the data tokens can be tough if you don't like that sort of thing -- a few lucky draws can outpace collecting more tokens -- but I didn't have a problem with it.  Overall, an enjoyable lightweight game with an enjoyable and very well-integrated theme.

[microbadge=1714]

[u]21-Jan-2014[/u]: Quite enjoying this push-your-luck, cyberpunk, crime thriller of a game...[i]solo[/i].  So far, I haven't had anyone to play this one with, so I've been playing the game straight up co-op style with no changes to the rules and even played "true solo" as a single character during my last session.  Really having fun with it.

Playing the way I do, it's strictly a PYL game since there is no competition or player interaction ([thread=1373028][/thread])...well, if you're playing multiple characters, you can certainly work together to gain as much stolen data as you can.

Anyway, this game has a cyberpunk theme to it where you play a group of criminals stealing data files from a corrupt corporation.  It's a card based game with action selection.  You need to grab as much data as you can and get out of the building before the cops arrive.

Really love the theme of this.  Typical high quality art and components from FFG...although they use those Euro-size cards which is annoying but I can see the reasoning for them.  It's not a deep game, but I am having lots of fun with it as a light, thematic PYL game.  Glad I got my hands on a copy and look forward to more plays.

RATING: 7
Nice, simple "push-your-luck" game that is dressed as a more complex and deep experience.

PROS
- Great theme and aesthetics
- Easy to explain and learn
- Enjoyable gameplay overall if the players ar attracted by the theme

CONS
- Way simpler than it looks
- Feels like being overcomplicated for the sake of it, or maybe to strengthen the theme... items and all those elements are just adding (unnecesary?) layers to a "push-your-luck" experience

This looks under-rated to me. A really fun game that does a good job of creating a unique storyline each time as the mission quite often goes chaotically wrong. Very impressed, this game is fresh and unlike anything else I have played, how often can you say that these days?

I really want to like this game, as I love the art and the theme, but it does nothing for me.  Perhaps because it is even lighter than Infiltration, Incan Gold simply scratches the same itch better.  Even using the "advanced" rules, which all gamers should start with even on their first play, the game feels unfulfilling.  I prefer King of Tokyo as an alternative to fill the same time slot.

RATING: 6
A játék gyakorlatilag majdnem minden eleme random, de ez a játék egyszerűen zseniális. Iszonyúan rövid játékmenet, egymással versengés/kicseszés jellemzi.

Tetszik a visszaszámlálás, mert nehéz megbecsülni, hogy meddig is merészkedjen be az ember a facility-be. És ha akkor még valaki rájátszik egy kártyát, hogy akkor növeljük meg 10-el, .... :)

A minőség kiváló, a mechanika zseniális. Egy hátrány talán, hogy ketten kevésbé jó játszani, de így is bőven kapja a 10-est! Jó vétel jó árért!

Update: 10-15 jatek utan mar nagyon unalmas... :(

RATING: 6
1st game was crazy fun, with a lot of stuff happening and the win coming down to the last move and some awesome luck.  A lot like Incan Gold only with a little more going on, which seemed a good thing.  Also an enjoyable theme and Fantasy Flight's usually great artwork.  Still, I wondered how it might hold up on repeated play.

2nd game not nearly as good.  Never felt that much tension.  In fact, I could have probably snuck out with the most data for the win but it seemed too easy so I pushed my luck a little and just barely didn't make it out, although we pretty much knew how many turns we had left near the end.  Kind of a humdrum finish.  The randomness of the order of the room cards seem to offer some interesting combinations sometimes but not always.

I'd give it one more play to make up my mind.  Probably not a buy but I wouldn't turn down a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pros:

Cyberpunk aesthetic is done well, really feels like you are going through rooms in a building even though you're just flipping over-sized cards, fun decisions like should you keep trying to mine the data in the room you're in or press your luck by going into the next room for more data, even though the threat counter is steadily rising? 

Cons:

You start out with a limited number of item cards you can play and it's not very easy to get more so it never feels like you have enough.

RATING: 8.5
Fun and thematic game.  I enjoyed it, but it left me wondering about replayability, just because the paths to victory seem limited/scripted.  You're either going for all the dice, and hope for an "Executive Elevator" exit.  Or your going half way to ensure you can retreat.  Then it comes down to luck of picking the higher scoring Data Files.

I don't know that it matters so much.  I had fun on my first 2 plays with 6 players.

This one burned out pretty quickly for me. While it's a fun push-your-luck game that just about anyone can understand, it starts to play out pretty similarly after awhile. It also didn't help that there was no support from expansions, and playing with people who would rather play it safe tend to ruin the spirit of the game.

Push your luck game where you either move on to collect treasures or return before the time runs out. The overly complex rules and tiny card texts add nothing to the game experience. Also there seems to be a problem that a player can continue to move on with no chance of surviving just to hasten the game clock bring down the other players. A game like Deep Sea Adventures is a much simpler and better implementation of this game idea.

I got this game sight unseen based on some reviews I read.  Really enjoyed the randomness of the initial setup and how the characters you choose to play are irrelevant to the game mechanics.  Everyone is on a level playing field and the gameplay is all about how you use your item cards and your turn strategy.  Makes for a quick game that has lots of replayability to it.  This one is screaming for an expansion!

RATING: 9.3
Looking forward to this. I suspect it will be similar weight to Elder Sign which we like a whole bunch.

Really like it. SImilar in weight but great little mechanics, fun components, nice flavor to it. Just light enough. Just enough tactics. Lots of replayability.

This game doesn't have so much a learning curb as an enjoyment curb. I think negative reviews for this game are only based generally on one or two players. I think this game really amps up in enjoyability with more plays which sounds like a real downer, but many other games are the opposite and actually get less fun. This one really holds up with more plays and is a lot of fun.

UPDATE: I continue to play and enjoy this game. I think you need to give it a few chances before you nay say it. There's more fun, depth and interest here than you'll realize the first couple of plays. I like the theme, aesthetics and elegance of it too.

played this twice with 4 players at my local game group so far. Great cyberpunk themed game with surprisingly deep game play for a game that is light and quick to play. I think this game has good potential to be a light favorite at our game nights, characters special abilities and item cards can be put to cunning use as the semi-cooperative play turns into getting out quick with as much data as you can whilst setting off alarms and booby traps to foil the other players.

I love this game.  Always a blast and it's a good balance of strategy, push your luck and not very complicated.  Pick an action and do it.  It's funny how many games end with nobody even making it out of the building because one person has gone so far they have no choice but to move forward and they find something to increase the alarm and force everyone to lose!  If they can't win, no one can!  Other times only one person gets out.  I think I've only seen two people escape the building twice.  Usually, if you've gotten a few things of data, just get out while you can. That alarm goes up exponentially after a few turns!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I really like the press your luck mechanic in this one, and totally appreciate the sci-fi theme.  It isn't entirely deep, and can be strange to introduce to new players.  As such, it doesn't get out to the table as much as I would like (trumped by Blood Bowl - Team Manager or Pathfinder usually).  Need to resurrect this one again soon.  Got it to the table again and it still has appeal.  The security officer jacked the alarm dial up each turn, so the game was quick.  One player made it out with the blackmail papers and just four zetabytes FTW!

Press-your-luck game based in the Android universe. Not bad. Better with more than two, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
People call Android a flawed masterpiece (SPOILER ALERT: If you're not playing the "Director's Cut", they're right) but Android's lasting legacy could be as a rich sci-fi cypherpunk noir universe where other games can be dropped into it, like pieces to a much larger conspiracy.  Infiltration is FFG's first attempt to shoehorn a game into this universe and it's not pretty.

It's not bad, per se: A theoretical team of criminals runs a heist on a corporation, scamming the information and leaving before the cops arrive.  But that theory devolves fairly quickly and becomes an 'erry-con-for-himself' motif against a ticking clock, and what usually happens is the cat who hangs out by the front door wins while the folks actually taking initiative and agency in the game lose.  It's a sour experience, and unfortunately it's bred right into the mechanics of the game.

I can see an Infiltration variant where everyone loses unless everyone escapes.  But as it stands, this game is just unfun.  And G-d damn it, I wanted it to be fun.

2017 UPDATE: You know what does this and is fun? Burgle Bros.  Go get that instead.

----- Preliminary thoughts -----

Heavily based on Inca's Gold, with a bit more depth. Luck seems to be a huge factor, probably too much. Still, games are not too long, so I'm willing to give it a try and maybe i will raise my calification.

Still, it's way too expensive for what it is (and I don't mean the components, but the gameplay).

RATING: 5
First impression (3 players): Simple rules and usually I like push-your-luck games but here the concept isn't as intresting. You try to enter building, gain info (points) and then run away but actually running back will take quite a few turns so end game probably is always kinda anti-climax as you just slowly go back from where ever you were because of how the design of the place unless there are other exits than the main one. Basically the game felt overall too simple, too random and just meh.

RATING: 6
Glorified Diamant, completely based on chaotic card effects. Pleasantly short, and a lot more interesting than I expected. 

Since the game depends heavily on item cards, which are difficult to get, and one-shot card powers, it is very easy to run out of meaningful options really quickly if you don't move further inside the building at the same pace as the other players.

The lack of even modest variable player powers is surprising. The real design flaw is that the player aid cards are totally useless: Instead of showing the game structure, or at least the definition of 'delayed', they consist entirely of flavor text.

Cyberpunk push your luck game. Short game, but has a few too many twiddly bits to make it feel fast.

Only played it with five players - too many?

I can see why certain aspects of this game might be unpopular, but in the end, it's one of the most fun gaming experiences I've had.

GRIPES: Executive Elevator and the Blackmail File seem a bit too strong. DATA FILES are really annoying to flip and stack!

SOLUTION: I found a solution to the DF tokens. 1 Dice Bag, 1 fistful of 12mm d6s. Place the d6s into the room to represent how many tokens are in the room. When players need to grab them, have them draw that many tokens from the bag. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Stealing from a big corporation...Yeah! Send thieves in to collect data files and get out before the proximity timer reaches 99; that's when the cops arrive. This game is incredibly simple to play and quick to teach. It also works very well with 2 players, but I expect even more fun with a full complement of 6 players. The box and card artwork is awesome. I think this is a pretty amazing game for such a small box. It is of the quality and production of Elder Sign. In fact it looks like you are about to play Elder Sign when you open the box...but surprise, surprise a completely different adventure awaits you.

The characters are all the same, without any special powers...I would have liked to see some differentiation, but that isn't significant enough to deter me from playing. Perhaps there will be a small expansion in the future that will provide special powers. 

Thank You Secret Santa 2012...you are very wise!

Players are tasked with going into a high-tech building to download victory points or something. When the alert dial gets to 99, the cops arrive and anyone still in the building automatically loses. There are things that can happen that make the dial go up faster or slower (It's 1D6 + X, each turn, where X tends to increase as time goes on)

RATING: 7
There are 12 rooms, all face-down, each with a special power. Everyone starts at room 1, and each turn you simultaneously reveal your action this turn, which may be to move forward, retreat to the previous room, steal VPs from the room, do the room action or do one of your randomly granted special power cards. If you're sharing a room, there's a Diamante feel - if you both go for the VPs on offer, you'll share, so should I move on to the next room and hope to get its spoils for myself, or is my opponent thinking the same thing. It's horrible in a good way. Also, the dial that will end the game is increasing each turn via dice roll so you either have to estimate how many turns to end of game and give yourself enough turns to get back to room 1 and out in time, or hope that one of the remaining unrevealed rooms is an exit - because if you don't make it out, you can't win. That's your big game defining decision. The game provides variety by a different selection of rooms and their order each game, as well as through the special power cards. Both of which, plus the simultaneous revelation factor, make the game pretty random, but at least in comes in at the right length at 30 minutes or so, making it a nice addition to the sim-revelation genre that I'd be happy to play in future.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
"Clever lighter game that plays well with 3-6p. I don't love simultaneous selection, and there is a bit more messing with each other than I prefer."

What I like:
- Push-your-luck, but not as light as most
- Very few direct attacks; mostly indirect interaction
- No involuntary player elimination

What I don't like:
- 2p requires each to control 2 operatives
- The push-your-luck is not incremental, but is at the "win the game/lose the game" level
- Generally I'm not a big fan of simultaneous selection games

I agree with the advice that anyone who is reading this should play with the "Extract" variant. Playing with the specific starting items variant definitely helps with the theme.

At 50-60 minutes for 4p-5p learning games, it ran a bit longer than I had hoped. Once you know the game, 30 minutes is definitely doable.

I would put the weight at 2.2, slightly above the current BGG-voted weight.

I rather like this push your luck game. It can be "broken" easily if players decide to only go like 2 spaces and head back out. You really gotta push it and hope to get out for this to be enjoyable. I liked it, but it's probably my least favorite Donald X Vacarino game.

It's a heist! In the future!  Break in, grab data, and Break out before the "automatic security system" calls the police.  Win by gathering more data than your heist team.

Movement from room to room could be faster in this game, and some turns your teammates will screw you, or you'll wind up wasting your turn due to turn order.

Nice, fasted paced game. It's got strong theme and creates the tension of a heist with simple rules and setup.  Strategy-wise it can be very interesting, especially if you know the other players well, because its very important to be able to predict what they'll do. "Heads-down" style players can really detract from it though.

It has an interesting theme and it's all very well done - but I think there's a pretty good luck of the draw when it comes to hand cards. There's some cards that are really good and technically allow for "multiple" actions per turn and some which are total one-offs. Since everyone is out for themselves and there's not much of co-op possibilities, it's hard to even play the social game here.

The eventual screw over is kind of fun as is the excitement of going deeper and deeper into the facility, but I'm not sure if there's enough variety and depth in this for the long haul. I'm already slightly bored at it after couple of games.

Comparisons to this being a "Gamer's" Incan Gold aren't far off (Tom Vasel, I'm looking at you).  The barrier of entry can appear much more daunting than the game plays, but once you get into it you will find a streamlined push your luck game that can be a blast and keep people talking long after you've escaped or been caught by the police in the futuristic world of Android.  We had a game where the ultimate winner would have been caught if he rolled anything other than a 1 (to make the proximity marker go from 97 to 98 instead of 99) and he rolled the 1...  epic win for him, and a mark of a true push-your-luck game paying off at the end.

RATING: 7
If I had played Infiltration first, I would have never bought Incan Gold. Similar concept but the addition of new actions and modular setup really introduces some fun tactical choices to the simple push-you-luck mechanic.

The art is gorgeous and everything ties in nicely with the theme. The item cards are especially cool, however they can be awfully powerful in the right circumstances. The player with the best items can take a sizable lead. I strongly recommend using the item draft variant.

Overall: This is probably my new favorite game in the push-your-luck category. Perhaps my one complaint would be that it plays too fast and players will very rarely make it to the final rooms and still have time to escape. Hope to see some expansions for this game in the near future!

This is not a good game per-say but, in the same way the Arkham is a fun social experience where you can invest thought into your moves and die to a single die roll, it can be a lot of fun. It's a good push your luck concept. just wish it wasn't so obvious who's won the game (or who's in the running) so quickly.

a dungeon crawl type game that is really interesting with 2 since each has two characters thus you can use each character to help another.  This creates some interesting situations.  The end can really sneak up on you and getting out may be difficult f you press your luck too much.  There is a lot of luck with the die and card draw.  I don't think this can be taken to seriously but there is enough decision making that matter to make this game satisfying and fun game.  Reminds me a little of dungeon quest but with better interaction and tougher decisions with the item cards.   I'm not saying this is a great game but seems good and very different from Vaccarino's other games.

Decent enough game featuring push-your-luck mechanics and secret action selection. It's relatively good as a quickish end-of-night game (although I think it would be better if it was quicker), but doesn't really grab me. To be honest, I'm not a fan of the FFG components and thematic stuff either - tiny cards and an art style which to me is totally uninteresting. Not one I want to play often, but it's enjoyable when played occasionally.

After 3 plays:
Simple and fun push your luck game. Too bad that even with the slow game (starting at -1 alarm) we had to go back too early. This leads to the fact that the second floor has been barely explored in each game. Maybe we were unlucky with the dice roll and the room set-up.
Could occasionally be played for a short break between two more complex games.

Would not buy it at full retail price though (I got it for 8,4 euros in a

I like the idea of the game and it is fun to play.

RATING: 8
As far as six-player games go, this is one of the best. The simultaneous action selection and resolution keeps everyone constantly involved. Practically no down time. 

Think of it as a gamer's version of [b]Incan Gold[/b].

That being said, some plays are better than others depending on the random distribution of cards that happen to be in the game. For instance, our first game had no NPC cards in play at all, which resulted in the game being too easy and thus somewhat dull as a result (and it also didn't help that we got cards that weren't actively harmful either). The chances of this happening are slim but still possible. However, you could remedy this by taking out some of the more "helpful" cards to increase the chance of getting the more "difficult" ones, because we find the more challenging the game is the more fun it becomes.

Another nit-pick is that the characters don't have any unique abilities - they are all exactly the same. As such, it sort of lacks that "co-operative" feel one finds in [b]Pandemic[/b] where each character is able to preform a unique ability, which means in this game there is no need for the players to act as a team. Of course, the game is not trying to be completely co-operative, but it would have been nice to have more of that feel.

Outside of those minor quibbles, the game is a blast!

Oh, and you absolutely need to play with the "Extract" and "Item Draft" variants! I don't even know why they are considered "variants" - they should be standard!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Super lucky and swingy. If you're in the back, you're trying desperately to get up to new rooms to grab loot, but doing that is what screwed one of our players. She was forced to end her "run" on turn 2 with 0 VPs. She came in 2nd and nearly won...

I happened to get access to the secret room because it came up when it was my turn to go first. I was the only one who could get in, and I looted to my heart's content.

Then at the end, one player was in the kingmaker role: he ends it early and hands Player X a victory, or lets it go one more round and it's between Player X and me. He can't do ANYTHING to better his position.

Not one person who played thought it was good. One guy read the variants that are supposed to mitigate some of that (why the heck aren't those just the rules?!), and he said if we'd played with those it might have pulled itself up to a "mediocre" rating.

I think it suffers from Stephen King syndrome: Donald X is super successful, so no one pushed back on some of the bad ideas here.

Cool idea, but not well executed. Play Incan Gold or Diamant instead, IMHO.

A perfect example of how Fantasy Flight and light games don't mix.  The game does an awful lot to get in the way of your fun.  The marketing is clearly missing something since everyone seems to go into the game expecting things that are not there.  All in all, there's a lot of spinning wheels to accomplish very little.  The potential of interesting card interactions is realized in such a small percentage of actual game time, it just doesn't feel worth it.  About 70% of this game should be on the cutting room floor.

I'm not sure why I didn't like this much - I guess it was the chaotic nature of it - rooms are random - cards are random - rising alarm level is random (though predictable within limits). There didn't seem very much you could really plan.

Having said that the theme is neat, the art is good, and there's a lot of creative work in getting the game elements to fit the theme. This will be a blast for some so don't let my moderate rating put you off.

Clunked up push-your-luck game, which is great since they were always too simple of a mechanical exercise for me. Go or stop, reveal random event, blah. Here, the thematic paintjob (I actually feel more like a hacker here instead of in Netrunner) dresses things up and the exploration just feels more exciting. The actions are intuitive and the items add spice. Get in, download and get out before it's too late.

Defective play possibility due to random items and rooms, but it's short and forgivable when it happens. Wish there were more variety in Rooms, NPCs, items etc. Expansion?

This game is a total blast to play as it has that great press your luck tension baked into a package that allows players to make ridiculous plays that can completely change the outcome of the games. You have to accept that you are at the mercy of fate (and the other players!) when playing  but solid tactical play can pull your chestnuts out of the fire, assuming you have a bit of luck.

I like this game, definitely feels like an Ameritrash take on Incan Gold.  

Like many games that have a lot of card text, there's a lot of explanation of items and rooms as they get played/revealed to people unfamiliar with the game, and there's some fiddlyness with all the bits that have to get sorted and placed.  

Incan Gold works much better as a lunch game or party game.  Infiltration works better as a game night game, if you have the right group.

A fun push-your-luck game set in the futuristic 'Android' sci-fi universe.  The players control Cyber-criminals who are breaking into a building to steal valuable data files from the first and second floor rooms, which are represented by cards that are progressively revealed and then entered. 

Nice components and rulebook.  Sort of a part dungeon crawler/RPG, part card game.  Not too difficult to learn or teach, and plays quite quickly (once you know the rules and turn sequence) but hard to win, as you risk being trapped in the building if you keep going too long or too far in search of those data files.

I like Dominion and I like Kingdom Builder, so I was hopeful that DXV might have designed something equally enjoyable. Infiltration is not that something. It's very light, essentially an Ameritrash Incan Gold but with a higher probability of everyone losing, as occurred in my play. Looking back, I can see what we could have done to avoid the outcome, and although a more cautious approach would have worked out better in this play, it could have easily gone otherwise. There's so much luck it's difficult to strategize except in retrospect. In our play, the game had an unfortunate mismatch between fun and optimal play.

There is a bit of dishing along one edge of the box top (it came that way), but is otherwise sound and unharmed. All components are present; as it has only been played once, everything is nearly new outside of one of the stand-ups, which has a mushy tear at the bottom due to the teeth of the plastic stands provided by FFG (the tear is covered by the stand and is difficult to notice without scrutiny).

I quite liked this game which is the second Vaccarino game I've played (with Dominion being the first).  For a cheaper, smaller box game with fewer elements it had enough going on to keep me interested and probably could for several more plays.  I love the competition with other players and how the alarm dial mechanic works and factors into the game play.  There's also a great press-your-luck factor as the higher level floors offer greater rewards but are further from your escape route.

I won my first play by being conservative with my exploration (I didn't venture past the first set of floors) and driving up the alarm counter myself with items and interface actions.  Only 3 of the 5 of us made it out of the facility and I had the DF advantage.

This game, like many, is most fun with more players.  5 worked great because there was a lot of interaction with other players and because of the relative simplicity of the game there was little downtime.  I also love how the game can be played in around 30-45 minutes making it a decent filler.

Pro tip:  Always use the Extract instead of the Download action cards for your games.  With the Download card, turn order gives earlier acting players an unfair advantage while Extract balances this out and doesn't make the game any more complicated.

All right, I'll come right out and say it: this is the game that Diamant/Incan Gold should have been.  I came into the game with a decent overall idea of what the game was about (thanks to various contributors here on BGG), and I figured I would enjoy the game, and I was actually correct for a change!  Never having played the game before, the exploration element was doubly fun, but I`m guessing that the way in which only some rooms are used every game and the fact that they are randomly dealt out would help the excitement factor to hold up well with repeated plays.  For me, Diamant was very fun for a play or two and then quite rapidly lost its lustre, but there are enough interesting elements in Infiltration that I don`t think it would have the same problem.  The game was tense, interesting, and exciting, and the fact that we were under a bit of a time pressure only helped with the overall atmosphere!  Components-wise, the room cards were larger than I was expecting, and everything else was... functional.  Except the card text.  Dear FFG: For the love of my eyesight, use a LARGER FREAKIN' FONT SIZE!!!  But possibly the best compliment I can pay this game is that, despite being in the midst of a bit of a game purge at the moment, I`d like to acquire Infiltration.

After one play I don't know what to say. Game idea looks good, random board layout is promising replayability, simultaneous action selection suggest tense… Such a game would rank 7.

Alas, randomness is heavy and spoils the experience. For example, if you're lucky, you start with special card that may help you finish on a first position. If you're unlucky, some items you'll never see, unable to get more cards that allows you to break through some obstacles – obstacles guarding more special cards. Stuck on a last position, deprived of tools, locked in infinite loop, you're becoming spectator. No cookie for you. -1 to rating for randomness. 
 
Moreover, graphic design is utterly bad. Very important text on cards is almost invisible if you sat too far, card oard character figurines cover the cards almost completely, and most of this problems might been solver but large gameboards and better layout. Current player experience is rubbish. I understand business constraints, yet I don't like it. It could be a lot better. Due to, add -.5 to rating.

This is not at an Arkham Horror style adventure game. It *is* a push your luck game, *BUT* even then that's only one aspect of it. For me the main meat of the game is in generating a series of asymmetric, vaguely repeated Prisoner's Dilemma puzzles, which is perfect for a Heist game featuring selfish but nominally cooperative crooks. I think it does need a crowd that appreciates that, but if you have that going it's great.

It's hard to look past just how pretty this game is, but I'm really not sure there's a lot going on here...

Essentially, it really is Incan Gold with a little bit of padding (and random events in the form of items and differing rooms).

If the group doesn't bunch up, your choices are even further limited as there is no point taking 4 or 5 turns to get ahead of someone else as the game has so few turns.

The randomness in VPs seems to bother me more than it should - in our game, I'd collected 18 VP tokens and had a score of 27 whereas another player collected 12 tokens and scored 29. By any margin, I've done better than that other player, but lost through random luck.

It's not a long game and the security timer does sneak up on you, but if people stop opening new rooms (as we did with 3 remaining) there are no further surprises in the security level and so you can calculate approximately how many turns you'll need to escape.

In all, an interesting idea which is pretty massively disappointing and Incan Gold shows how simple the game idea really is and how much padding this game adds to try and make it more substantial.

Admittedly, I have only played Infiltration once with the basic rules. It was a learning game, but, unless the advanced rules dramatically change the decision space, I can't imagine requesting Infiltration. The game reminds me most directly of Incan Gold. It is a push-your-luck game with a lot of chrome added to evoke the Shadowrun/Cyberpunk setting of Fantasy Flight's Android property. The chrome is fairly evocative. The game, unfortunately, is not. Though the actual play-time is not long, the game feels very slow and repetitive. This slowness drains much of the push-your-luck tension from the game. Incan Gold, while no bastion of strategy, uses a streamlined ruleset that focuses the players on the decisions that matter most, and thereby creates worlds more tension.

RATING: 6
I usually like push-your-luck games, but I didn't feel that I had much control over what was going on.  There were a few times where pushing my luck wouldn't actually result in anything.  For a push-your-luck game to work well, there needs to be more of a feeling that taking a risk gives you a chance for a big pay-off.  Basically only the players at the lead of the pack have a chance to do this.

This game has three things going for it: razor-sharp theme, a simple but effective risk-vs-reward system, and the potential for awful hilarious wonderful villainy. Rad game.

RATING: 7
It's not a masterpiece by any means, but it's a fun way to kill an hour.  Good use of the theme and some genuine tension.  Also interesting in that it forces some on-the-fly metagame analysis.  If everyone tries to do the same strategy (like camping the exit,) the value of that strategy plummets.  You need to be innovative, skilled, and just a little reckless.

I think it's worth noting that while nobody with whom I've played this has said, "I've got to get myself a copy of this," nobody has failed to enjoy themselves, either.  That's sort of how I feel about this too.  Absolutely non-essential but still fun to play.

RATING: 8
Having not played many "push your luck" style games before, I am happy with infiltration.  I wish the room cards were oriented differently (small font on each means people across the table were constantly asking "what does that room do?") - but the game is simple, fast, and definitely fun.  I only plan on playing this with 4 or more, though. 

Other thoughts: I think everyone should use the advanced "Extraction" variant from the get-go.  More player interaction = better play experience for this kind of game.

After a lengthy rules explanation/rules search/rules clarification, which took longer than the actual game, I think we still messed something up with the item cards.

While my fellow thieves bravely infiltrated the complex, I hovered near the exit, made one big score and fled the building, setting off every alarm I could find on the way. Because it's not enough to do well... everyone else has to do poorly. Honestly though everyone else had cleared out all the good stuff already and I had no hope of ever catching up with their VP's. My only chance was to send them all to the pokey.

Bob was the only other player who had a hope of getting out. Mencah got stuck in sludge and Dan dove deeper into the complex hoping for a mystical escape hatch to appear. Dan's desperate flight set off yet more alarms which resulted in Bob being nabbed right at the exit, securing my win.

It ended up being more fun than I expected, mainly since I got to screw everyone and savor their wails of despair, but there was too much AP in our group. These games are fun when they are fast, but when people start thinking about their moves and deliberating about what to do, it really sucks the joy out of the game.

RATING: 7
If you can find it, I highly recommend grabbing this gem of a push-your-luck game. 

As a huge fan of the Android universe, I was naturally drawn to this game. But after having played it many times with groups who had no idea about the setting, I can tell you that it stands well on its own. 

A fun little risk/reward concept that focuses on a semi-cooperative cyberpunk heist, Infiltration sees you drawn greedily further and further into a dangerous facility. Your goal is to get in and get out before the Security forces arrive, but ALSO to have the most sweet loot. So, you know, it's gonna get interesting very quickly. Especially when so many of the item cards in your hand can be used to both help AND hinder your fellow players.

Takes around 45 minutes to finish a game, and so far I've had a blast with any player count.

Not sure how it holds up in terms of replayability, but infiltration is a relatively quick, fun game. It takes Diamant (Incan Gold) and adds NPCs, item cards and a cyberpunk atmosphere to it. Because of its push-your-luck nature, one game may be considerably longer than the next. An atmospheric medium-sized filler.

RATING: 4
At heart it's not a bad push-your-luck design, and the Android chrome is a lot of fun. Ultimately, it's a bit too long and a bit too swingy: Deep Sea Adventure does the same thing at a better weight AND in a better time-frame.

While I'm a fan of the crime genre of fiction, it seems that heist themed games are generally far and between in the board game world. I had to snatch up Infiltration while I could, seeing as it had relatively decent reviews. Although the game's premise works just fine, we find that getting to the second floor of the building is rare, and that the winner is heavily dependent more on the items one begins with.

Incan Gold, with many many more rules.  Which is to say, it starts with a solid base, and does a good job adding theme and story arc.  I don't think it really adds much in the way of interesting decisions, but it's still short enough to be fine for what it is.

I actually don't think I like the advanced rules for download/extract,  as it gives even more power to the "unlock some more point tokens, then take them" item cards that are given out at random, and those are already extremely strong.  Drafting the item cards also seems to be much better than getting them at random.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game definitely feels like it would benefit from an expansion or two, which I hope they get around to making some time.  But even on its own, the quickness of it and the tension of raising that dial every turn makes for some very exciting and fun plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A fun sci-fi press-your-luck game. Better than Incan Gold because there are more strategic decisions.  Quite a bit of randomness, both in the collection of Victory Points and the layout of the rooms, but with the relatively short play-time I think it works.  There are advantages and disadvantages to being the first to advance into a room..danger vs reward.  Also, greedily acquiring VPs while watching the clock to ensure you escape the building before the time runs out makes for an interesting amount of tension. 

Overall, I really enjoyed this one & look forward to my next play.

I find that there's some good and some bad to this game.  That can be said for a lot of games, but it's just a matter of which one outweighs the other.  I like the concept of the game -- having standard cards and special cards, and finding interesting combinations among them -- but I don't like some of the characteristics and mechanisms of the game.  It's essentially a race game when you get right down to it, though the need to return to the starting line before the game ends adds an interesting incentive to keep you from running pell mell to the end of the track.  Plus, it's a little frustrating that the rooms that allow you to draw special cards are only available once, benefitting the person who's already ahead in the race.  It creates an uneven scarcity of resources that I don't like.  Right now, I'm still interested in playing it again, though it's mostly due to curiosity to see how it plays with different numbers of players and/or a better familiarity with the cards in the game.

Cyber punk card game. Two rows of room cards are laid out face down to represent the lower floors of a corporate high rise building. Special cards for specific rooms, pile of data chips, and a timing marker to indicate how soon the cops arrive. Players draw action and item cards. The players are high-tech thieves using data extraction to steal from the corporation and from each other. Push your luck to get the most data and avoid getting busted. Seems like a simple enough game. Up to 6 players.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A smash-and-grab game in the vein of Dungeonquest, but less fun.  One problem is that players who exit the game early have literally nothing to do. In Dungeonquest, players who crawl out of the underground with early loot can play cards as monster stand-ins - as well as point and laugh at the horrible things that befall the remaining players. No such opportunities for heckling exist in Infiltration, to its detriment.

I'll also repeat the comments of other reviewers that most choices in Infiltration are pretty straightforward.  The fact that DQ has barely any choices at all is beside the point, as its wacky and unstable nature is fun enough to carry the day.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a cross between Diamant and Dungeon Quest because each player is breaking into an office building to steal computer files. To win you must get out with the most files. Each room is a different card with different obstacles and things to collect. You only use 10 of the deck so replay should be great for the game.

I like this game a lot more than it probably deserves. It has a nostalgic air of simulation that reminds me of SPI games or Magic Realm. 

How? As (1) you set up cards that quite likely won't make it into the game and (2) many games play routinely  with the occasional game having the excitement of something out of the ordinary thus making the out of the ordinary feel out of the ordinary (whereas too many of todays games try to play out of the ordinary every times cheapening the experience).  

I really wish some self contained expansions with new settings would come out!

Pretty simple press your luck game with some theme pasted on.  Game felt too random for several of us.  If a bunch of you stumbled onto the passage to the secret room and you happened to be the starting player for that round, great you got a lot of treasure and if not, well you were out of luck.  While there was a bit more strategy than Dungeonquest or Incan Gold, the theme was not nearly as strong as it is in Dungeonquest nor were the events as much fun.  The starting item cards add some variety into the game, but further contribute to the randomness since players ended up with unbalanced mixtures.  To be honest, if I want to play a press your luck game, I would play Can't Stop which is a lot more fun and exciting.

This is a fun, light game.  I usually play it as a two- or three-player game.  The one time I played it as six-player, one of the players had very little available to him in terms of the amount of accessible data files -- the rooms had been picked clean by the other players.  So, I'm not sure how well the game stands up with a larger number of players.  That being said, for a smaller group, it's still fun.

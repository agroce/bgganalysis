This expansion (which can be played stand-alone) lengthens a game which is already lengthy. Paradoxically, this game would not be fun at all if it were finished in an hour. Game sessions tend to take about 4-5 hours though, which is a little long to my taste for a game which requires very little strategy.

A vampire variant for Munchkin. It's kind of cute, most of them are, but I really bought this to mix up with Zombies and a few other horror themes, which is a little more difficult than you might think.

RATING: N/A
I think I've developed past the point of Munchkin, there are simply so many games I enjoy more. But I feel that this is more of a "right group right time"-game. As a beer & pretzels-type game though, it can be okay.

Otherwise known as Munchkin:  Make a bunch of crappy expansions, good for exactly one laugh in a game that should be ten minutes expanded into untold hours of torture wishing that you had the +2 rapier of suicide so you could kill yourself an get it over with all ready!

Said Game will make Steve Jackson Games a bazillion Munchkin Gold pieces off of a really boring, looong, and repetitive game, sold to gamers too brain dead from playing this stupid game to know better than to buy more crappy expansions with the same jokes rehashed over and over and over.

Munchkin meets the World of Darkness! 

As always, Munchkin gives you more ways to hack and slash your way to the glorious level 10. The powers system makes sense once you get round the concept that the sum of all your powers must be less than or equal to your current level. 

Love the races, and their specific powers. But it's more of the same really, and that means more slow backstabbing until everyone has run out of cards.

[1 play] Vampire Munchkin.  There's almost no point in commenting further, as there seem to be two kinds of people: those who love Munchkin, are endlessly diverted by it, and can't get enough; and those who find it to be a one-trick pony: amusing for the jokes the first time you play, but after that it gets old quickly.  I'm in the latter camp.

It is a re-skin of the original game, as all of the various Munchkin games are.  If you like the original game and you like the gothic/undead themes of this variant, then you will like the game.  Not a lot of new stuff (though they have added new races/classes), just a lot of thematic cards to add a twist to your games of Munchkin.

The big drawback is that the card backs are different than those in the original game so if you want to combine them together you need to use card sleeves or they will be easy to spot.  Not sure why they chose to go that route, but all of the various themed versions of Munchkin are that way.

This version of Munchkin is essentially the same as all other versions, except for the horror theme, and it uses monsters instead of fantasy races or classes.

This version of Munchkin made me a believer in the game's longevity and ability to adapt other genres. What separates this from the original are the powers and the balance. Powers are unquestionably great as they add more decisions and different strategies. As for the balance, it seems somehow skewed in favor of the monsters you fight. Constantly defying the odds makes this game something different, as you either have to be more willing to use your one-shot items or negotiate with your group. The expansion adjusts the balance back to Munchkin normalcy, but I'm not sure that's a good thing.

Actually a really fun Take That game. Don't believe the negative hype, but do take a look at some of the cards before buying. If you don't enjoy the style of humor in the game, you probably won't enjoy the game too much. Despite the box description, it can actually be played with 2 and still be fun. It is far better, however, with more than 2.

Quite random and similar to Killer Bunnies.  It's too hard to stop somebody else from winning though if the cards are in their favor.  Playing this set by itself, it doesn't feel like there are enough cards to make decisions on, where at least the randomness of Killer Bunnies is stymied by more active decision-making cards that allow you to have a stronger impact on the game.

My first (bought) Munchkin. The first one I played was the original one and it was so funny! I played a lot of RPG and didn't know boardgames aside War or Game of life, so when my friend brought it to our pre-Christmas party, it was awesome!

I bought and played lots of Munchkin, but then I met modern boardgames and I started to not enjoy Munchkin anymore. It's still on my list only for the nostalgia I guess.

From the munchkins I own, this one is the one who have the most chance of being playing...

The main problem was that everybody left out of the game felling miserable, no matter if they lose or won it...

Vampires, Werewolves, and Changelings!  Oh my!  All the fun of a Horror RPG without the role-playing.  Of course, role-playing is the primary point of RPGs.  On the other hand, I do think this game is a fun diversion to quickly kill other monsters, gather loot, and build a character, all with fun pokes at RPG and Horror culture.  Maybe its due to the theme, but this is one of my favorite munchkin games.

RATING: 7
While this is an amusing game for fans of the World of Darkness line of gaming materials, the gameplay is not as tight as the original Munchkin. There seems to be far more powers and fewer monsters to fight, so a large portion of the game ends up being building your character up (or having to discard powers because your level is still to low to use them all), until monsters are no problem for you to deal with no matter how much your opponents try to prevent you from advancing. A little more balancing would have been nice. Probably works better when combining with another version (with more monsters).

RATING: 5
Pros: it does what it's supposed to do: it's very funny and entertaining.  But its target audience is a niche.  It's basically making fun of all roleplaying games.  It also has pop culture references.  But I don't find this game to be hilarious in a group unless they're vaguely familiar with RPGs.

Cons: Munchkin has virtually no strategy and the end game drags out forever.  Even in a take-that game (which is what this is), I'd rather prefer if it had a bit more strategy.

This is the only version I have played considerably, although I have played several others.  I think this is one of the cutest expansions, which is ironic considering lots of the cards are related to werewolves, bats, and vampires.

When I was younger and stupider, I thought Munchkin and its variants were funny, funny, and more funny.

Gave this one to Value Village.

Best game in the Munchkin game series. 7 is very high for one of these games, but I love the theme (Vampires and goths in general, WoD in particular). Looking at it as a pure game, it would drop to a 3.
Powers instead of classes is interesting. Should've been more cards labeled Armour, Headgear and Footgear though...

Had to drop the score: 7 --> 6.

Was a gaming café a while ago. Was asked to play a Munchking game (Zombies I think) and realized I really didn't want to do so. So: 6 --> 5.

The Munchkin games are a little paradoxical - they can be wacky and silly and fun, and they can also drag on and just be the same few actions each turn.  Good for introducing non-gamers to something new and simple enough for younger players, but not something I will pull out on a super frequent basis because nothing much changes from play to play.  The same holds for all the expansions.

In my view the "best" Munchkin, since there are not so many really mighty cards, such that you can easily kill every  monster. Still has the typical Munchkin problems.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
With this version, the monsters have a greater capacity to kill you and the Bat Pack rule allows you to get rid of monster cards out of your hand faster without having to wait for an additional card to do it.  Munchkin had a slightly lower death rating and Super Munchkin, compared to this, has hardly any deaths.  Like to have a little fear of dying when playing and it effectively stops runaway victories.

As I don't play World of Darkness games, this version of Munchkin was a bit of a let-down. Yes, lots of cards are based on general horror tropes, but the inside jokes relating to the rpg didn't quite click for me.
And having played the German version, there are some untranslateable puns here. This is oftentimes an issue in Munchkin translation and I suggest to play the original version if your (and your friends') English is good enough.

An ok party game, like every other munchkin game it's all about the players around the table and how often you've seen the cards.

I'm so-so on Munchkin, my brother likes them, so I play occasionally. 2 player is a waste of time though. I feel no incentive to help my opponent.

The usual Munchkin fun.  I like the theme, but I miss having the different colored backgrounds between the door and treasure cards.  It makes it harder to tell which faceup card goes in which discard pile.  Not a huge problem, really, but still ...

This was my first game of any type of Munchkin.  I really didn't care for it but my son likes it.  It's relatively quick, pretty random, and is kind of funny so I will play it when he asks.  My daughter likes Munchkin also.

Yet another munchkin game, but with powers (unneeded extra rule) and takes much longer due to many cards not being useable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun and enjoyable as any munchkin game, but I find that it has far fewer treasure cards than required. Every time we play with just this set, we wind up burning through the treasure at an alarming rate and having to reshuffle several times.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This one seems more difficult to get above first level than some of the other munchkin games. Overall, the theme didn't grab me like the others did and I would rather play one of the other variations on Munchkin

Muchkins with Vampires, Werewolves, and Changlings.  Too chaotic and too long for this kind of game.  Ganging up on the leader is nasty.

It's Munchkin, so it's solid in my book, but the hack n' slash nature of the game doesn't sit that well with a World of Darkness-style setting.  Fun to mix with other sets, though.

This munchkin seems to be better balanced than the original version. The games I've played have been uneven however. Some have been quite tense and fast, others drag on and make it impossible to catch up with the leading player.

An old friend got this for my wife and I for Christmas 06 and we have had a blast just playing with 2 players.  When my friend was in town, we found it to be even better with 3 or 4 players.  I bought another Munchkin module based on my enjoyment of this one and plan to get the Pants Macabre expansion soon.

Even within the Munchkin world of gimmicks, this is perhaps my least favorite. I can't say I enjoy this set particularly much, and I'd much rather pull out Apocalypse or Cthulhu themed sets in lieu of this one.

Munchkin vacillates between a 4 and 6 for me.  If it hasn't been played in a while, busting it out can be quite  fun - repeated plays can get dull very quick.

It helps to be a huge WoD fan. Like regular Munchkin, lack of rules coherency prevents it from being played more frequently.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Interesting twist to the standard Munchkin, with more cards that only affect certain player races (in this case, creature types such as werewolf or vampire) and customizable combinations of powers rather than classes. As always, mixing it up with other Munchkin sets makes for some bizarre games, but the power system differentiates this one from the others just on its own. But all the defining flaws of Munchkin are still there: The erratic flow of gameplay, attack-the-leader default strategy and "funny" cards.

Goth is good (in Munchkin).  Great as a standalone if you just want the vampire humor theme, but better to add to everything else.  Simple, chaotic fun.

Munchkin was one of the first games I played in this hobby.  I loved it.  After playing it many times I kind of got tired of it. I'd suggest trying a few out and picking up a theme that you enjoy and then keep it on your shelf.  I would never suggest playing this game with my group, but I do feel I should have it around.  

EDIT 9/17: I certainly no longer feel I should have this around. This is not a good game. It is way too long for what it is and there are no significant choices to be had in the whole experience. The choices you do have are usually so obvious that they aren't even choice at all. The game plays you...once the deck is shuffled, the game is over. It is like Candy Land in that way.

This is the ultimate +1/-1 game. I played this too much to be honest. It just isn't fun anymore. Most recent play even drove this point home, literally all but 4ish turns ended with me drawing another curse. So boring. SO over rated. If you like games, pass this one up.

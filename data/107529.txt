Gameplay is simple: You must place three houses on the land that your drawn card is. If you already have a house touching that land type, you must place a house there. However, the ways to score points vary each game [through three randomly selected cards at set-up] as well as the map varies from each play. So one game you might be trying to cluster your houses together and place them near the mountains. Another game you might be trying to have your houses in small clusters and going in a straight line across the map. 
There are special locations on the map that you can build near to give you additional building or moving powers each turn. These abilities can help mitigate the luck factor from whatever card you drew that turn. Most of these special features are touching two or more different land types and often have two locations on the map so if you want to obtain a particular power, you usually are able to if you aim for them early on.

151117 the elegance of the game has held up in my minds eye over the years.

130929 Its also just perfect as written -- but I don't really enjoy it too much.  I'll definitely play it, but I'll make sure some of alternatives don't get played first.  Its actually a bit abstract/thinky/heavy for my tastes.

121231 Nice light Donald X game - ie you see the initial setup, map out a strategy and execute as best you can in spite of whatever random luck hits you.  Played with a simple variant where you have two cards in hand at all times, and if two are a pair, then you may discard one to draw another.  As a game its almost too light for the box size!

[i]tl;dr - This is a fun game with more strategy than is first apparent, and it's worth the time to learn how its systems work. When players know what they're doing, this is a unique and tense area control game with interesting scoring objectives that change every game.[/i]

Kingdom Builder has gotten a bad rap, and it's a controversial game no matter who you ask. I happen to enjoy it, and here's why: 

Though the game appears simple, that's deceptive and there's a good deal of strategy underlying it. My friend described it as "Go meets Carcassonne" and I think that's a good summary. You are constrained by what card you draw (which, yes, is random), but if you play well and take advantage of the bonuses on the table, you will be able to mitigate this constraint, and this is where the game forces you to be creative and adaptive as you go. 

Skilled play will always beat random play, and it's great fun and a superb test of the brain. I highly recommend it, but do make sure you try it before you buy it, as it can be polarizing. I've appreciated continuing to play the game, as the random setup provides new scoring cards, new special abilities, and a new map every single time. If you play the game an awful lot, you may want to look at an expansion, but as far as I'm concerned, Donald X. Vaccarino considered the game complete as is. 

Sure, there's not much of a theme, but the mechanics are pleasing enough that you can paper over the lack of a theme, especially in a game that can crank out in about fifteen minutes per player. I love the variability and modular board, and I really think this game provides you with a range of deep strategic options.

This is from the same designer as Dominion.  It's an interesting little strategy game that's very simple to pick up.

With 8 different board cards and a variety of victory cards, every game is unique, similar to Dominion.  However, there's a bit more luck involved in KB than Dominion, and I just don't find myself getting into this one nearly as much. 

The other downside is that the game becomes significantly longer the more players there are.  Since the end of the game is predicated upon one player placing all 40 settlements, this simply means that a 4-player game is twice as long as a 2-player game. 

Even with the negatives, this is a good game, but if given a choice, I'd normally pick other strategy games over it.

(11/2017) I'm not sure I would say this is a bad game, but it's not very enjoyable for me.
For the light complexity of the game, I find it to be incredibly unforgiving. It seems like it is incredibly hard to come back from a bad move or from a short turn of bad luck.
On top of that, the game feels a bit flat. The decisions near the beginning of the game feel very similar to the decisions at the end.

If there's one thing Donald X. knows how to do, it's pander to the lowest common denominator among Eurogamers.  Kingdom Builder is yet another example of that.  It's similar in game play to games like Through the Desert and Paris Connection, but like all bad Euro game stereotypes it limits the player iteraction -- the thing that makes those other games fun -- and replaces it with a competition against the game system.

To play the game you draw a card and place markers where the card tells you to.  You can gamble that you will always draw the exact card you need, or you can play to minimize the negative affects of a bad card draw.  Or you can just play Paris Connection.

This is a fast game. Basic in strategy. Just enough variety in objectives and scoring to keep it replayable. Beautiful to look at. And my girlfriend likes it (which is a massive bonus).

Upgraded score after a 3-player and 4-player game - a lot more strategy involved. This is getting a lot of plays in my house and the more players the better it gets. The game is simple to teach and relatively short - great for teaching to non-gamers.

The "Nomads" expansion really adds a lot too.

3 plays / 2,5 players (5p=2 hrs, played w/expansions)

LIKE: fun placing houses, blocking opponents. many ways to score. simple rules, some depth, high replayability.
DISLIKE: getting blocked. there is some luck in the card draw. I suspect the maps could be "solved" for optimum strategy after a while.

OVERALL: surprisingly fun game. it could be quicker (5p=2h), and some luck is in the cards drawn, but that can be mitigated. It's the power tiles that make the game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Tried online and found it good. Really interesting use of bonus tiles.  While your house placement is limited by a random card draw, this is still mainly a strategy game.  Might add it to my collection.  It seems similar to Through the Desert and Hacienda.

After getting the app and playing a few times, my interest is waning.  I can't quite put my finger on why yet...

Back up to a 7.  It's good and presents a different puzzle each time, but not interesting enough to hold my attention.

This game has considerably grown with my past plays. There is indeed quite a bit of think inside the package - and it is deceptively packaged. Placement is forced upon you - but this is (I believe) only to speed the game along. It still leave you with many decisions - especially when you acquire special powers through the locations which opens up play considerably. Variable scoring combined gives an interesting replay value. The best feature? Speed. This game plays in about 20-30 minutes with experienced players. So I like it as a quick gateway style game. Very happy to have it and wife likes it.

The original game is rather dull and unexciting. Nearly all the decision making is made at the start of the game when choosing where to first place. After this, the terrains dictate all expansion due to need to use the card drawn. House rules allowing for a hand of terrain cards are a huge improvement.

Truly a game that absolutely must be played more than once.  The first time you play, you're wondering how this is even a game.  But after a few games, you realize that the game's very simple surface hides quite a bit of depth and, importantly, replayability.  The BSW version is also fun.  Not as good as sitting around a table with friends, but it's still quite enjoyable.

Fun, family game which is less random than it first seems.  The mechanic and idea of the game is excellent, but it needs more variety and/or some sort of role card to enable different strategies.

My initial impression of Kingdom Builder is very positive.  It reminds me of Dominion with its random setup and subtle player interaction.  The rest of the group seems to enjoy it as well, and I'm hoping that it will stand the test of time with us.

RATING: 8
This seems to work very well and quickly for the 2-3 player games I've played so far, I have now seen most of the cards and its whether their interaction and speed of play will continue to keep hold, it doesn't seem like it really has enough variety at the moment so hopefully there is also a mini expansion to come with some more scoring cards and possible buildings. I expect to play it mostly two player as I've seen others play this quite slowly on game night, at which point I think I will tire of it quickly.

This game reminds me of Connect Four with a crappy theme tacked on to it to give that certain "Euro Elegance."

You're not really building a kingdom.  You are placing cubes.  You know what this game needs?  War!  What better way to build your kingdom than to destroy your neighbor's kingdom and lay siege to his castle and pillage his villages!  And you know what be even better?  Dinosaurs.  Yeah, add a herd of triceratops stampeding across the landscape goring his people (cubes).  But I'm not playing with cube dinosaurs.  I need plastic dinosaurs.

If you did this, then yeah, Kingdom Builder would be a good game.  Unfortunately, it is not a good game.

Why it's previously-owned:

I traded this game for Magnum Sal.

The unmitigated randomness in this game just kills it for me.  It seems that even the best strategizing can sometimes result in the game "playing itself," reducing the card draw to another turn in an ever-so-slightly deeper version of Candyland.  There's enough obfuscation (via changing boards, goals, and expansion pieces) that it's not a completely terrible experience, but I won't be adding this one to my collection.

RATING: 5
I played this game just twice, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

After my first play of Kingdom Builder, I discovered that I had played a major rule wrong. That explained why I hated the game so much the first time. Then I got a chance to play it a second time and, while I still don't really like the game, I can now see its merits a little bit better and understand how it won the SpJ in 2012.

Kingdom Builder does come indeed with some strengths: for one thing, the quality of artwork and components is pretty good and everything looks nice on the table. Also the game is very quick to teach and easy to understand, which will make the game probably really accessible for kids.

On the other hand though, I'm really not a fan of its game-play. As many reviews mentioned already, I also don't like the fact that you are dealt one card and that for that turn you're completely stuck with it... so when you don't need to build over there, well, it sucks to be you! Yet what I found more annoying is another rule: the fact that you have to build adjacent to one of your buildings. I know that you can work your way around this restriction, but at some point during the game it's the game itself that is basically making most decisions... not you! I find this extremely frustrating and very, very stupid. Without this rule I'm pretty positive I would actually enjoy the game much much more.

So... while I don't hate Kingdom Builder anymore, I'm surely still not its biggest fan. I see why some people might like it though and how it could be a successful product for a family crowd. Just probably not for me.

"Old school" spatial abstract in some ways, but with "powers" and lots of variant scoring.  Not too confrontational, usually, and interesting.

With the expansions, there is nearly as much variety as Dominion here.

:cry: :D :D :) Update after 20+ plays: a great 30 minute light game. Scratches lots of my favorite itches: spatial reasoning, area control, making the most of a tough situation. 

There is a luck factor but if you plan for flexibility, and plan your power tiles well, you can usually mitigate it at least 95% of the time. 

Liked it so much that I kick-started the Big Box Edition.

This is probably the best themed nearly abstract games I know. The terrain card draw prevents it from becoming a pure abstract, and broadens its appeal to a huge audience.

Kids learn it fast and play competently. Non-gamers also learn it quickly. It's sometimes harder to get gamers to play it, surprisingly.

The game is hugely replayable and plays under one hour. A classic.

This is actually a decent strategy game: yes, there's luck in it, but very little, and certainly not anywhere near enough to swing a game. 

So why have I given at a mere 5? It starts with the theme: I tried to lift up the game by the theme, and the game fell to the floor, leaving the flimsy theme dangling in my hands. It is an abstract, pure and simple. As a fan of theme, I feel somewhat insulted that, rather than present a fairly decent abstract game, they pretended Kingdom Builder was something it is not.

Purely on Kingdom Builder's qualities as an abstract, it is a decent game; but there are soooo many abstracts out there that are far, far better. This one works; flawlessly, in fact. But it's dry as dust. You'd be much better off with Ingenious or Pente rather than this poser.

RATING: 8
I love this game. So many options provided by boards and cards means no two games are the same - it plays fast and is easy to teach new players. Always happy to play this even when I know I usually lose. The player is at the mercy of what terrain card he draws so you need luck as well as strategy but the game is short so even if you have bad luck it does not drag on.
Having now played this with expansion cards and 5 players I find the gap slows up a bit as people have more options. The base game is clean and fast.
Over the years I have downgraded this game from 10 because it's not so much fun against dedicated players who can leave you standing and then it's not some much fun when you are behind with no way back

Read the endgame scoring cards and then study the map carefully to spot the best scoring locations. Figure out which bonus action tiles will be the most help.  Place your pieces to get those bonus actions and maximize your score.  Of course, the other players may get there ahead of you and the luck of the card draw that determines the terrain you can place on can shaft you.  In our game, one player drew a long sequence of desert cards, while I never saw a flowers one.

For me, Kingdom Builder felt quite abstract and quite flat.  Interaction there is, in that an opponent can block you out of a location, but the board is so big that none of that ever felt decisive; there's always somewhere else to place and score.

I do like the variability of multiple modular boards, randomised victory conditions and bonus action tiles.  Production is up to the usual Queen standards, though the artwork is bland and generic.

Overall, a good experience. Nice variability is provided via the randomized board, different land tiles and different gold-generating cards used each game.  It definitely has a similar feel to Dominion in a few respects: relatively short playing time, variability from game to game, simplistic game play, etc.

Update 11/30/14
I thought we were all in agreement last time to play it again, and my wife was, but my son was not.  He said it was too simple/basic.  I don't entirely agree as I think the special powers do offer up some interesting movement options.  Still, it's not deep enough for my wife and I as a two player game since we prefer medium to heavy euros.

Update 11/15/14
Rating after 1 play with 3 players.  Everyone enjoyed it and is willing to play again.  I will be interested to see how much differently each game plays out given the game's variable nature.

Kingdom Builder sounded like my type of a game when I first heard about it. Now I can safely say that my instinct was correct. Constantly having to think about increasing your flexibility for each separate terrain type is a truly unique aspect of this game that I haven't seen elsewhere. I want more plays of Kingdom Builder, but I feel that it has nowhere to go but up from this rating.

I was quite surprised to find that I really enjoyed Kingdom Builder.  It reminded me a bit of Hacienda, which I've rated a 9 based on one play so far.  After more plays of each, it's quite possible that the two will switch in my ratings.  Kingdom Builder has very simple rules and not too much to think about on your turn, but still has a lot of room for tactical and strategic plays, and every game will be different due to the modular board and varied victory conditions.  Lighter than I expected, but also much more fun.

RATING: 8
Many people have given Kingdom Builder a bad rep. But we just don't see why. Yes it lacks the innovation and strategy of Dominion. But it is still fun for what it is. And that is an abstract strategy game with beautiful art and fairly simple mechanisms. You draw a card and then using the terrain on that card play your houses onto the modular board to the best of your ability. Vaccarino has made a game that you can teach in about 5 minutes (that's how long it took a couple to teach us to play it at Dice Tower Con 2014) but enjoy playing for a very long time.

I disagree from those that think that Kingdom Builder is a shallow game with obvious plays and not many options. After a few matches you will learn how to open yourself some alternatives for good moves on every turn.

The complexity of the game is trying to meet the special points conditions and using the special moves tiles while doing good placement limited by a random terrain and previous placement.

Not much depth; and obviously no luck with terrain drawing at the beginning and/or during the game can ruin your play if you don't make it to the good tiles.

I can imagine poeple liking it, but not the number of highest ratings, the big buzz and all the prizes it got.

For the same randomness and on the same theme, just play Settlers of Catan, which is almost 15 years older but just much better made and as much approachable.

[ESP] sinceramente no estaba segura de que esperar de este juego. Tenía mucho buzz pero su nota cuando lo compré era inferior a 7. Por otro lado ya tenía juegos similares.
Fue una grata sorpresa. Kingdom builder es un juego muy sencillo de aprender en el cual cada partida es diferente gracias a sus múltiples tableros y métodos de puntuación. Si te gustan los juegos de control de area entonces te lo recomiendo 100%

5 jugadores - jugamos en un tablero de 2x3. El juego fue tan bueno como con 4 jugadores. Eso si todos jugaban bastante rápido (con jugadores lentos se dee hacer eterno...)

RATING: 9
A great game that often gets wrongfully accused of not giving the player options, due to the one card rule and the rule about building next to an existing settlement if you are able. The game is a puzzle that requires players to think about how to use the "powers" to break away from the games' restrictions. Positioning your settlements properly and using your "powers" creatively is key to victory.

The game is light, but players still make interesting, strategic decisions throughout, assuming they set themselves up that way.

One downside is that the game can go south for you on the second turn if you are unlucky with the terrain card you draw that turn. After one turn, you may not have been able to set yourself up for flexibility. If you are unlucky with your second card draw and are forced to build your three settlements next to your current settlements, it can make you play catch up for the remainder of the game.

Two plays, 4P and 3P.  The 4P game was tragically slow, on the order of 90 (!!) minutes.  Not a fun first experience.  Second play went much smoother.  I'm pressed to think of a game which yielded more of a non-opinion from me after a couple of complete plays, or I guess more like an "I still don't know..." type opinion.  And I don't have a great inclination to replay it, but I totally would, and could see myself asking for it out of curiosity.  I think an iOS version would probably be ideal for my tastes, with rapid-fire AI play.  Others' turns just aren't interesting at all for me here.

Tried really hard to like this game, but there's just not enough to sink my teeth into. The first couple of turns are disproportionately important and will likely determine how you'll play the rest of the game. You can have a terrible first move and just lose on the spot (and not know it). Many turns will be played on auto-pilot based on card draw. The game is also super dry; the theme never came through. This game plays like an abstract.

The strength of this game is at the same times its weakness; the game experience can be completely different based on board layout and cards. Luck [i]can[/i] be a major factor in some games, though it's far less important than the initial evaluation of starting moves and which bonus tiles to acquire first. I hadn't expected this game to have as much staying power as it's proven to have. Not nearly done playing it, so far.

Thousand variations with different board construction, different abilities/power ups and different victory conditions each time.

Kingdom builder is a fine game but not one I find particularly compelling.  I do like the way Vaccarino builds in replay value by having a large pool of possible victory conditions that change from game to game.

Purchased on the strength of Vaccarino's name and the Spiel des Jahres win. It's fun, with DXV's trademark variable setups, but shallow and occasionally infuriating (especially when you get unlucky card draws).

We went a full year plus without playing it, however, as we had better options in our collection. But then we added Crossroads (the 2nd expansion) and the promo "Caves". Now the game gets a boost of a full point (from 7 to 8). The added strategic depth and the ability to mitigate bad card draws totally rejuvenates the game and makes it worth our play time!

Hacienda light... Kb. ugyanazt az élményt adja, fél órában. 3-4 dologra kell figyelni, tehát nagyon egyszerű (talán túl egyszerű is)! Mivel egyetlen kártyánk van mindig, brutálisan nagy a szerencse szerepe, de így is látok lehetőséget a taktikázásra.
A játék legnagyobb pozitívuma, hogy nagy az újrajátszhatósági faktora (pontozási szempontoknak és bónuszoknak is csak töredéke játszik egy-egy játékban), a másik meg, hogy akár 6 évesekkel is játszható. Komolyabb játékok közötti pihenésnek jó. Ez az első, amit próbáltam a 2011-es esseniek közül (tavaly a 7 wonders volt az első, azért ahhoz képest ez gyengébb kezdés:)). De egy próbát megért.
---
Újabb 3 parti után az az érzésem, a megszerezett lapkák 90%-ban meghatározzák a végeredményt. Szinte minden variáció esetén van egy lapka, ami erősebb, mint a többi, egyértelműen azt kell megszerezni minél hamarabb. Ezen keresztül viszont a kezdési sorrend, és az első kézhez kapott kártya nagyjából el is döntheti a játékot. 
Továbbra is tetszik, hogy nagyon pörgős, néha talán túl egyértelmű és mechanikus is, hogy mit kell csinálni, ettől unalmas is lehet...
Egy kicsit jobban tetszett, mint elsőre.

RATING: 7
Nice easy game..pretty straight forward for newbies, a few choices to make but all lead to already predestined goal per game, so they may be considered as not really choices altogether. The placement via cards randomly drawn takes the tactics aspect somewhat out of the game, which in this case is not really a bad thing. Better with more players as with 2, you have far too many choices for placement and expanding in my opinion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Deserves a lot of credit for having some depth with a very simple rule-set. I actually like the choices and the care you need to take when playing.. and with the variety of boards and victory conditions, it's a great balance.
This could even become a 9 later on..

Games that remind me of Tigris always score well, and the kingdom borders, proximity to others, being careful to see where you're kingdoms are spreading and how, all smells like a Tigris and Euphrates game to me... and that's brilliant!

RATING: 8
Excellent strategic game of settlement expansion, with a high quality finish. Three victory conditions are chosen from a possible ten at random every game, and there are double the amount of board pieces you need to play the game, so every game can be different. The victory conditions work to significantly alter your approach to the game, rather than feeling tacked on. Each game board has specific pieces you can pick up to gain an extra play every turn, or move in a way that you usually wouldn't be able to, and the use of cards to determine the type of area you must play in works well for this kind of game.

The game is nice and short, and only needs five minutes to set up. Plays best with 4 or 5 players. Two or three players would also work, but it probably gives too much room to play and means you can always place your settlements where you want.

Great longevity, quick to pick up, and has plenty of strategy. If anything, it's a little dry - it's a game that my group enjoy and play occasionally, but it doesn't generate any laughs or conversation afterwards.

Pretty fun game.  It is the same complexity of Settlers of Catan which would be a good substitute for as a gateway game.  One can definitely get screwed by the card draws and I can see that.  It is promising to see that there a lot of replayability due to various game boards and victory card combinations.  I want to play again using a variant in which you place one house per card to reduce luck.  I want to play more to decide if I should add to my collection.

Kingdom Builder is an almost abstract, quite fast-playing and almost gateway game.
It has very simple rules, but also a number of nuances, even if it's a short game: every turn the players aim for short term tactical placement, while setting up their position for future plays.
I am a little annoyed by the single terrain card drawn every turn: I can see it being a decisive factor in determining the winner...
Anyway, Kingdom Builder is another polished and intriguing design by Donald X...  yet it suffers from the tragic destiny of being compared to the most innovative and paradigm-changing design of the last 10 years: Dominion.

Update february 27, 2013: with more than two players the game is definitely more enjoyable. The board is more crowded and there's more blocking. It is a fast paced but thoughtful filler. Vote raised to 7.

RATING: 6
first few moves decide (randomly) who gets a lot of special tiles and who is stuck if one. from then on someone will have nothing to do for the rest of the game and be bored out of his mind. i'd be willing to play this as a filler game if all the special tiles were divided uniformly, as it is it is BORING to be stuck with 1, and NOT FUN having lots of them and seeing how bored others are. lose-lose.

Nederzettingen bouwen die aan elkaar grenzen op het gebied dat door de kaart wordt aangegeven.  Deze kaart wordt elk spel anders samengesteld en geeft je verschillende krachten, waardoor elk spel weer anders is!

Elk spel is zeer verschillend, aangezien je 3 kaarten uit 10 trekt, en deze zijn je doelen tijdens het spel.  Er zijn dus super veel combo's mogelijk.
Ook het bord ziet er elke keer weer anders uit.

Eenvoudige spelregels, snel doorgelezen of uitgelegd.
De strategie ontplooit zich tijdens het spel, en je kan niet meteen te veel fout doen.

Mooi spel dat vaak speelbaar kan zijn.
Relatief korte duur: 45 min zal wel kloppen.

Well - whaddaya know?  Sort of a pleasant surprise, this one.  I had the choice between DXV's Dominion and his new one last night, and I definitely wasn't going to jump in on a game of the former title.  Then again, I wasn't terribly excited about trying out KB, but once I actually got into the game, I found it fairly entertaining.  It's certainly much better than the old cardfest of Dominion.  I'd actually like to play again sometime.

It tries hard to provide variety, but can't hold up to it. No matter what how the map is being generated, it just feels exactly the same like before.
The objectives may vary but have almost no thematic meaning, making the game just a meh abstract in disguise.

RATING: 9
It may not have theme, but it's a satisfying 30-45 minute game. I have taken out the Lords goal, because adding in area majority makes it suck and pours downtime all over like cold vomit-inducing grease. The reason Kingdom Builder shines is its speed, the tactile feel of setting down wooden houses and making progress as you watch the board fill up, and that it is a bit different every play. I lose more than I win, and it is a delight every time anyway.

Fun and simple. Kids enjoy it. I like the random scoring, boards, and location powers. Nice thing is that it is quick and easy to teach. A little too simple to rate much higher, but we'll see how this fares after several more plays. There's a lot more to this game than meets the eye. Rewards multiple plays.

Essen '11: Feels like Domaine with variable victory conditions. Players take turns placing influence markers on a terrain-laden board, blocking off sections a la Domaine. There are placement restrictions based on terrain type. Placing next to certain unique locations give a player access to special placement abilities for the rest of the game. Each game uses a random set of end game victory point conditions. The game ends when a player runs out of influence markers, and players tally victory points.

Similar to Dominion, this game has a huge amount of replayability with its modular board set-up and different winning conditions every game. There's so many possible permutations that it's very unlikely to play the same game twice. I love games like this, very simple to learn but has a hidden layer of depth. Additional point, I think the adjacency rule is pretty neat, players need to best optimize the limitations thrown to them.

This is a great game when played with the right group. Having one card that dictates where you place your settlements is limiting, but is also a terrific challenge, making your first turn crucial. Players sharing the same scoring goals only adds to the tension. And with random board setup and goals, there's plenty of replay value. Don't believe the naysayers. Terrific game.

Very easy game where everybody can have fun even if they won't win in the end.

The scoring is done only at the end and during the game you simply lay down settlements to try to conquer territory in a pattern that you like using the different abilities offered by the map. If that pattern also give points, all the better!

Nice,albeit little more abstract game. Has a great replay value, with al the different set-ups. Although it is often quite obvious what you have to do. Better with 4 players then with to, because the game will be more tight. Then it is really a tens game, hoping that your 'spot' will still be free.
Waiting turns can became boring, when playing with slow thinking players. A timer might be helpfull.

Players build settlements on a variable player board on the terrain type indicated on the card drawn each turn.  Three randomly drawn objective cards influence how each game plays and scores offering lots of replay ability.  The depth of strategy emerges with more plays.

The game certainly does not deliver on the expectations I had after the small hype created when it was announced. After two plays I'm pretty underwhelmed and will probably never play it again. There doesn't seem to be anything to this game. Just draw a card and put down some houses as best as you can. All decisions are so straightforward the game is just plain boring. The best thing about it is that it's short.

I know this is a game that many people are divided on, so I was excited to try before buying to make up my own mind. I could definitely see the similarities to Dominion. The variable setup with the boards and goals could lead to hundreds of unique games. Then there is the whole idea of building towards the special abilities first and then making the switch to going after the victory points later. I'm a huge Dominion fan, so this was definitely a winner. You can easily see that the game is an ideal family game (which is right up my alley) because the rules are pretty basic. I think the strategies might be a little tough for some non-gamers to understand right away, but with a few games under their belt it should work fine. I don't think the limited options (only 1 card per turn) is actually a problem in the game. It limits AP, and forces players to plan ahead based on how many terrains they border. So, while that is often one of the primary complaints, I actually think it's one of the selling features.

An excellent game and my favorite by Donald X.  There is more depth to this game than some give it credit for.  It is all about using the location tiles to get yourself out of a corner or cut off your opponent.  I don't think people give this game the credit it deserves.

Forget the theme, this is a completely abstract game, probably best described as Go with colour. Easy to learn/teach and play, but the variable map and end goals keep the game fresh, such that each session presents a new puzzle to solve. Requires a house rule for people to not be screwed out of the game on turn 2, also the early decisions are vastly more important than the ones near the end, so the game is a bit front loaded.

People who claim that this game runs on autopilot, likely don't get how you need to play around your handsize limitation of one card.

I played this for the first time today.  Upon our first play, we thought "this is stupid and way too simplistic".

A very light game of placing cubes (houses) on a map.  It's very simple and seems to have a fair amount of variability in the setup to keep it different.  I'm just not sure how good it really is though.  My first play was okay, but I think I was underwhelmed as I just expected a bit more.  After two plays, my interest level in this game is quite low.  I'd play it again, partially because it plays so fast, but I will not seek it out.

Third play showed me the goodness of the fast play and variability for this game.  I still don't love it, but with 15 minutes to spare I'd be fine with playing this.

RATING: 5
Just not a very good game.  They took a simple game concept--which is fine, I like simple game concepts; I like a lot of you-have-one-type-of-move games--and threw on a bunch of varying powers and varying endgame goals.  If you look at it that way, it is actually very much like Dominion.

The problem is that the 'simple game mechanic' just isn't very interesting or really even any good.  You very often have 2 or less options of play choices on a turn, and really have no choice beyond just simply picking whichever choice gives you more points in the randomly drawn end game goals.

Plus I think the special actions are way too powerful, and I mean all of the place-an-extra ones and all in the same way.  From the handful of games I've played, whichever player gets more special-action spaces which in effect gives them more settlement placements per turn wins simply because they end up placing many more settlements than their opponents by the end of the game.

Bleh.

This has some similarities to [i][thing=503]Through the Desert[/thing][/i] in that you are placing pieces on the board and may be trying to connect to certain areas. The real difference for me is the way you score changes every game, as does the board set-up.

Scoring is determined by conditions determined by drawing three cards from a deck of scoring rules and they are in play for the whole game.

This game is so darn simple that it makes it the easiest choice to bring out for a time filler. The card tells you what terrain to place your 3 settlements and then you decide which terrain to place them following the adjacent rule, THAT'S IT! No complaints.

Have heard a lot of people rave about this, and I can see it is a nice game, but for me it is not that special. Sure the mission cards give some variety which will give more replayability but, when it comes down to it, the basic game-play is pretty obvious (I can't believe I have been hearing people say it has taken them a couple of games to get into the tactics). So, nice, light, but don't believe the hype.

Unthematic, fiddly, dull and boring, Kingdom Builder is simply an overrated game: I’m even unsure it can be still called a game, since it almost plays by itself, all you are allowed to do all the time is putting some wooden bits down on the board into a handful of possible locations, already chosen for you by the game’s mechanics itself.

Weren’t Kingdom Builder by the same author as Dominion’s, I doubt it would be so highly rated: anyhow, I find Clans a much better game than this one, since it pretty plays the same but is easier, faster and above all it doesn’t give itself airs as Kingdom Builder does.

I honestly have never been that interested in playing this game, although I was always willing to give it a go just based on the designer pedigree, however this blew me away.  I really like the strategic / tactical decisions you have to make.  I also think its neat how many different ways the game can change based on the end game scoring conditions, or expansions you use.  Really neat game, and one I would really like to play much more of.

Basically a non-game.  Yeah there is some strategy in what areas you touch, but the main conceit of the game as a mandatory placement with extremely limited possibilities was a terrible idea. Then you have the completely bizarre Lord cards that reward you for things like how many houses you have in a horizontal row.  The theme here is non-existent, but at least Dvonn and other abstracts are pretty.  It's only redeeming quality is the short playing time.  However, for but a slightly longer time investment you could play the much superior Through the Desert which scratches the same itch.

Lots of variable set up.  The ways to score points and the board setup change every time you play.  Very abstract game with little to no theme, but that doesn't bother me.

The biggest complaint I hear about this game is that you only get one territory card so people say you really don't have a choice of where you play.  I like using the powers to help overcome that limitation and work towards the goals.  That being said I always want to play with the Paddock power, which lets me move around the board.  Or the wagon power from the Crossroads expansion.

An okay, but long, filler game. There's too much luck-of-the-draw resulting in a game of tactics, rather than strategy. It's okay, but nothing special. The rules are pretty easy so I can see this serving as a gateway game.

This is an attractive looking game, and the combination of modular board and varied objective cards should give some replayability. My favourite thing is the fast-flowing nature of the game. Each turn is quick and simple, so there is virtually no downtime. That said, I found the game overall frustrating. The one-card draw often leaves you without much you can do on your turn, or at least without much of use, meaning a few wasted turns burning houses in places you don't want them. It happens to everyone of course, so balances out and at least it's your turn again very quickly, but no less frustrating. It has a slight feel of Through the Desert to it, both in pace and in some of the tactical choices, although to me it doesn't always have the tension of TTD.

So tired of the complete lack of imagination, folks.  Kingdom Builder?  Seriously?  Can you think of a more bland, generic name?

Make games that are more appealing on the surface instead of this "Hey, check out this clever mechanic I have, isn't it *COMPELLING?*  Here's a cookie-cutter safe theme on it so you can feel like less of a nerd."

One of my all time favorite games!  I love the high degree of modularity.  I love the tactical opportunities that careful play provides.

When I first got Kingdom Builder I wasn't sure for how long it would hold my interest.  Then I found that with every play I like it a little bit more, a little bit more, a little bit more.  It continues to grow in value and the expansions have proved to be fine additions.  Kingdom Builder is a keeper.

Probably optimal at two player, but still very good at three, and still very enjoyable at four and five players.

RATING: 3
Provisional rating based on one play, likely to change if I play it again (probably going down!).

Felt to me like Through the Desert - this is a route building game, rather than area control or building a kingdom (which makes the name totally misleading!)

You're chaining to points of victory - but unlike through the desert you have a distinct lack of control, and because of this and the mechanics it can disolve into AP hell ...

Very tactical - you have the start of the game analysis where you are going to place and your first turn, then after that it is a case of optimising your current turn, which you can try to plan in advance, but can be messed up (inadvertently as no one will know what card you have)

I found the whole thing dull - it plays slower than Through the Desert, is more fiddly, you have a lot less control (getting the 'wrong' card is frustrating) doesn't have cool plastic camels. The game is solving the optimisation puzzle of the card you draw, but I just didn't find it enjoyable.

The theme is totally pasted on and doesn't really fit - why am I building these chains of settlements? Why does getting to this spot let me now build more settlements in rows? Why does the knight score me vps for building in rows? 

More than happy to see it go back in the box and didn't really care who'd won at that point, not a good sign.

Lots of variety, with each game having a different puzzle to solve, different vp cards and variable map (don't know why they didn't just back print the maps though and have a separate scoring board).

I'm sure many euro-gamers will love it. I don't.

Not a bad game.  It's easy to teach and quick to play.  The varying boards, special powers, and goals means this game has a high degree of replayability. 

Mar-2015: I've fallen in love with this and have acquired all the expansions.  With repeated plays, the amount of control increases significantly. However, this is a game that all about front-loaded strategy.  Your first 2 - 3 turns will often determine your game and mis-playing them can be unrecoverable.  It actually has a bit of a similar feel to Terra Mystica, but much shorter.

Kingdom Builder is a fairly light strategy game, wherein a random map and victory conditions are generated, and players must claim areas in a fashion that nets them the most victory points. Players draw a terrain card each turn to determine which type of terrain they can claim for the turn. Sometimes, a player can wait an entire game to get a particular terrain card, but it doesn't happen. This can result in some disappointing games, but clever players will find a way to work around this. The game is fairly quick, and good fun.

3 plays in a row.  Light placement game that has good player interaction.  Contrary to some of the negative comments I feel that this game does have some interesting decisions to make.  It isn't Agricola, nor does it pretend to be anything other than what it is..a good fun game.

More plays now under the belt and I am even more impressed with the possibilities in the game.  Each game plays very differently due to the variable setup and the variable victory conditions. Definitely underrated.

RATING: 9
Kingdom Builder is a short, light, mostly tactical experience with high replayability.  The game provides variability in both map construction (which affects which special powers will be available to the players) and in how victory points will be scored.  This creates a highly variable game in which both the goals and the means to achieve the goals change each game.  The meat of the game is in figuring out how the special powers and goals interact and then executing a strategy as best as your cards allow you to.  

The actual gameplay is simple, and I think this is where some get frustrated by this title.  Draw a card, and play 3 houses on the terrain you drew, and use special powers you have acquired.  This tight constraint on where one can play makes the game feel more light than it really is.  After a few plays, though, players will begin to see how to position themselves to make use of whatever the deck provides.  This would be rather dull if not for the fact that the special powers and goals and map change from game to game - it is this variation that keeps the house positioning interesting.  

This is a light game that plays quickly - 45 min is probably accurate once you know the game, and 30 min is achievable with quick players.  Interaction is limited, but can have a significant impact.  Turns are mostly tactical optimization of point scoring for the landscape drawn with just a few strategic considerations.  My wife really enjoys it, and I suspect we will get a large number of plays out of it before it gets stale - and then there's expansions.  

Update: After 15 plays, we both really enjoy this and consider it a must own.  Short, and easy to teach, it is a great game for casual gamers, with enough there for me to enjoy as well.

Juego abstracto, con el tema pegado. Se supone que tenemos que construir reinos, aunque lo suyo en realidad es buscar emplazamientos para las casas. En tu turno, tienes que sacar una carta y tienes que colocar las casas en territorios del tipo indicado en la carta, con la particularidad de que, si es posible, tienes que estar adyacente a tus propias casas ya construidas. 
En cada partida se sacan unas cartas "de puntuación" que te dicen qué cosas se van a tener en cuenta para obtener puntos, lo que le da mucha rejugabilidad.
Es un juego ligero, sencillo de jugar pero con profundidad suficiente como para estrujarte el cerebro. Me gustan ese estilo de juegos.
Es apto para no jugones.

Another nicely done abstract that includes a well done board and bits. Reminds me of Through the Desert with the placement of settlements having to be adjacent - akin to the caravans. But it has a scoring system that changes with every game (you pick 3 of 12 cards that provide requirements). Seems to have variety of play, but scoring is not as complex as TtD.

   The more effort you put in to this one, the more you'll get out of it...

   My reaction after my first game was "... and I spent my money on this?", but after learning how to squeeze points out of as many settlements as possible (often by way of maximizing location tiles), my opinion really changed.

   It's a good game, but all too expensive in my opinion.  I wonder how much money Queen games makes the consumer pay for the (needless) inclusion of cards & rules for every available language in print?

Abstract. I can see why it might not have met people's expectations after Vaccarino's smash hit Dominion. But I really enjoy 'placement abstracts' so this is a natural for me to like. The scoring cards seem like they'd keep it very fresh, and the physical view of the board growing throughout your turns is nice.

I loved this, very glad I finally got to play. The spacial component is interesting without overwhelming the game play, and it does sort of look like you're expanding your kingdom across the map. I like the interplay between the scoring cards.

This game seems underwhelming at first, then frustrating and when finally it clicks, it and can be a very interesting not very long abstract game.

At first it seems underwhelming, because it looks like  you do not have a lot of options, it looks like there is no strategy. Then it can be very frustrating when you get stuck in a type of terrain in an area of the board because you did not place very carefully your first houses. It is also very frustrating when someone gets extra placements each turn from special powers and ends the game when you have many houses remaining.

Finally, you will learn from your mistakes, understand how to place your initial houses, how to avoid getting stuck and how important special powers are and how to get them.

The problem of this game is it can be very difficult to introduce new players to it, because they can think that the game is bland or frustrating or maybe they do not know the game as well as you do and cannot present an interesting match.

I actually enjoy playing this game, but I do think there is something seriously wrong with the basic rules. Having only one card limits what you can do so severely that it often seems like the game is playing you.

Classical simplicity, in a eurogame sense, with a limited amount to do each turn and lots you want to do; though the game narrows your options to a manageable extent which keeps things moving. The few special buildings available each game are key to making the most of your turns and the variations in them, the board layout and - in particular - the three objectives which trigger point scoring - keep it fresh and replayable.

Too much fortune in the cards drawing.... maybe a little modify in the cards deck can give much more interaction and depht: for example, two territories on each card, 1st "principal" where you can play 3 settlers, 2nd "secodary" where you can play only two settlers...

I enjoy this one, but it's not without issues. Primarily, while it's short, it's probably not short enough - games seem like they'll be decided in the first 5 minutes or so. For a light game, too much AP potential also. And you have to be willing to play really fast once you know you've lost, otherwise the game will take too long.

Despite its issues though, I do like it. I like the variety, I like the reasonably quick playing time, I like that it does have some interesting tactical nuance. But I doubt there is much long-term value here, and I can't see anything like the same scope for expansion as the deck-builders have. While Kingdom Builder isn't a deck-building game, it presses many of the same buttons.

Played it 3 times in a row straight out of the box, and still would have been happy to play more, which is a very good sign!  The game plays quickly enough (our games were taking 30 minutes) and has an addictive quality along with variance from game to game that definitely gives it that "one more time!" feel.

Just from a rules read, Kingdom Builder might sound pretty boring and a bit simplistic.  However, while it's definitely not a heavy game by any means, the randomized selection of special actions and scoring cards from game to game is a fun puzzle to try to navigate from game to game.

The main complaint I can see people having with this game is that card draws can sometimes end up dictating your game since you only have a hand of 1 card and must play to that terrain type.  I personally didn't mind this, as the special actions and shrewd placement can help to mitigate the luck of the draw.  However, some people are not going to care for this.  Fortunately, the game is very easily house-ruled is it's a problem for you.  The third game we played, we played with a hand of 2 rather than 1, and while I would play either way, some of the players liked the game much better with a hand of two.

Overall, Kingdom Builder is a great mix of simplicity and fun.  You could easily teach it to anyone in less than 5 minutes, but the game play will keep you coming back again and again!

[thing=107529][/thing] is a 2011 Spiel release by [thing=36218][/thing] designer [person=10525][/person].  It was one of the most popular games at the convention, as it is a perfect design for such events: simple rules, quick playtime, high variability, and fairly addictive.  Somewhat like [thing=36218][/thing], it's a game where you can just grab a few people who are standing around and churn out a session (including teaching, if necessary) in a flash.

On its own merits, however, it is a perfectly mediocre title.  The closest anlogue might be something like [thing=8051][/thing] (which I actually think is a little more interesting).  Nearly everyone I spoke with described it as "fine," "okay," or (more positively) "pretty good."  The gameplay is simplistic, and the opportunities for cleverness decrease as the game progresses.  Due to the settlement placement rules, the last few rounds are mostly on auto-pilot.  The game's graphic design is also uninspiring, and at times bordering on ghastly.  For a simple game, this is no great sin.  But I would have liked to feel more like the games I play are a labor-of-love.  [thing=107529][/thing] feels like a good idea that settled for "good enough."

I wasn't sure if this game was going to be fun. The first beginner game was OK - one player ran away with it. The second beginner game we played was more contentious: more blocking, players tried to deny points, and so on. It was suddenly more fun.

Even with four players, the game seemed to move relatively quickly - the game took about 45 minutes.

RATING: 10
The variable set-up alters your approach to the game every time, while the interaction between the players offers up subtle questions as to whether or not one should block them, or even, force them to expand where they would rather not expand to.

Also, your first placements are extremely important, as you have to judge how to get the most points based off the geography (bottlenecks are important to control), the point cards, and the special powers.

While the game seems like it should be difficult to teach with all the variables that change from game to game, it is actually quite easy as you only have to explain the variables for this game, as opposed to all the possible variables, so you learn as you go instead of all at once.

Nomads offers some mild twists that increase the explosive possibilities of a player's turn, while showcasing some new ways to get points. It improves a great game more than I thought it would.

Sweet little connection game. I think it'd be easy to dismiss this as being at the mercy of the cards, but the more you play the more you will see how strongly the game encourages (and allows for) forward planning. It has a light puzzle feeling that I really dig, and gives you plenty to think about during your opponents' turns.

My one quibble is that the power tiles can make or break the game sometimes. I actually think this is less of an issue in the base game, but much more pronounced once you start adding in a ton of expansions.

And on that note... this is a strictly 3-4 player game. Two is dull, and while the Nomads expansion ups the count to 5 it becomes unbearable at that number - the fifth player is always screwed out of the good power tiles early. Honestly, it's probably best at 3.

Blah.  I was unimpressed the first time out, but I keep giving this another shot in the hopes that perhaps I have misjudged it.  It continues to bore me.  Who cares if the board & victory conditions change with each game?  It just means that the boredom has more variety.

Not sure why anybody would really like to play this game. It is okay-ish, but there is virtually _no_ depth or strategy present. The only things you have to consider when playing are:
a.) Place your houses so that you get lots of end-game points
b.) Place your houses so that you can "spread" over the whole board and are not forced by the "luck of the draw" to build into one direction (unless you want it).
c.) Place your houses so that you can get the bonus tiles and castles on the board.

And that's it :)! For the price it is sold now, I think the game is quite okay (8 - 10€ for the base game) but charging a whopping 40€ on release + another 35€ for the first expansion (which basically adds nothing but a little variety in scoring cards, boards and an additional player) is ... not okay!

Note: We played the physical version of this game at least 10 - 20 times (including the first expansion) and somewhere between 5 - 10 times on the iPad.

Sale price: 5€
Condition: complete, played a few times (includes first expansion; tossed expansion box and insert)

[u]April 2014:[/u] I must say I have never EVER felt so underwhelmed after reading a rulebook. I just could not figure out how thi game could be of any interest whatsoever. I mean come on, you have to put three houses by turn and you don't even get to choose where??? wtf??? I almost traded it away without even playing it. But I did try it (just by principle) and guess what... That game is actually really good! There is, sure, a very big constraint on what you are allowed to do with the card draw which seems like it kills all choice but actually no, there many places where one could place three houses on green pastures. You also have flexibility from the powers you can gain and you actually need to be far-sighted so that long term strategy is actually present and not in a small dose! Indeed, given you are allowed to build houses only adjacent to each other except if you can't means you always try at the beginning to not open up your territory (so that chances are you won't be able to play adjacent and can therefore play wherever you want) but in the middle game where you'll presumably be always able to do so then you're actively trying to open up at each of your little villages so that each time you can choose which village to expand. This was a very pleasant surprise and was our most played game of 2012. The game is good at every count and the different objectives and powers really make some very different games from one to the other. Again, I was very pleasantly surprised. The Nomads expansion provides some additional variation without modifying the gameplay much.

For some reason I thought this was a game I wouldn't enjoy as it seemed too light (despite all the buzz), so even though I've bought 400 games, I passed on this one. However, I reconsidered and thought it might be a good game for my family - I was right! My brother, mom and dad all like it. In fact, so do I. There is endless variety in the setup because of the 4 board and the 3 scoring cards, and even though you can get really screwed by bad luck when drawing terrain cards, clever play can often mitigate this (especially if you own any of the special tiles). Not always, but often. 

Kingdom Builder is not as good with 2 as it is with 3 and 4, but that doesn't matter as my wife doesn't like it that much, so I will rarely be playing with just 2. It's definitely not one of my favorite games, but I really like it for what it is. It plays so fast that you'll often want to try it again right after the first game, but with new boards and new scoring cards.

I love Kingdom Builder; it was one of my first Euro Games, and while I've found others that I like better, it still holds a special place in my game collection.  The  game has a high strategy-to-complexity ratio (which I consider good), and can be fun even for people who aren't avid gamers.

I've tired of it over time.  This used to be one of my top games, but I'm now finding the replay value to be low.  It is also a game that is bad for players prone to AP.

This game gets a certain amount of hate largely because its designer didn't make Dominion 2.0. For that matter, it would have likely been hailed as a classic had it appeared years earlier, with the likes of Carcassonne.

However...

Gamers who come to the table for a gentle, thoughtful, artful experience will enjoy its variability and regard its supposedly greatest weak point--the fact that you must play your pieces according to the one card you draw--as a virtue.

This game plays on the idea that restriction is a key component to creativity--something that artists often understand more than audiences.

Very simple and fun game with elements of strategy and chance. I think this would be great with expansions, which I know exist but have yet to play. Game length seems appropriate; my groups haven't gotten bored playing it, though maybe a little frustrated by bad card draws. I think this is a solid game in need of greater replayability -- more ways to score points, more abilities, etc.

[i]Received this after winning the Queen Lancaster Games contest.[/i]

OK, so I got this game for free, so how picky can I be, right? :) I rated this game a 7 after one play. After reading the rules, I expected a slightly different take on Through the Desert, and after one play, that seems to be about right... with some caveats. Through the Desert is very pure in its tension. There's very few rules, and all you do on a turn is place two camels--that's it. It's clean, and it's full of tension.

With Kingdom Builder, you have a bit more going on. There's the restrictions of placing only in the terrain of the random card you're dealt. And, that can cause a healthy dose of frustration, which will bother some players but not others. You've got an increasing number of building placements if you can reach those special locations on the board. And, you've got the "every game will play different" design intent with only 4 out of 8 building types and 3 out of 10 victory point conditions in any given game.

That last point is not trivial; I expect that each game will feel noticeably different and present a twist on the general challenge. My rating will likely change after a handful of plays to see if this holds true. All in all, it's nothing spectacular, but it's a solid game with some "meat" and a reasonable playing time. It's a great "next step" for those having played Ticket to Ride.

Update after a couple of two player games--the two player game is definitely more "polite." Right now, I'd say this is best with 4, then 3, then 2. Maybe we can come up with more cutthroat tactics eventually, but with only half the pieces in a two player game, there's plenty of room to work around obstacles.

Update: Traded away in a math trade for Through the Ages. Ultimately, I was playing this mostly with my wife, but it's not a very good two player game. And, given the collective "meh" reaction from my game group, I just didn't see this getting any regular play.

I can't believe this got a SDJ nomination. The game is easy to play, though it has a whole heap of fiddly special powers that are difficult to interpret specifically. There is very little interaction and after a couple of turns you are effectively bound to the luck of the draw. A poor design IMO.

The modularity of the game makes it a huge hit. Add to that the surprising depth that can be found and it's one of our new favorites. Again, it's not a really deep game, but there's more to the game than when you first unpack it and set it up.

Less interactive than Samarkand:R2R but has that same light but smart Queen-y feel. It takes takes a little bit of engine building, does away with card hands, throws it onto a board, takes a simple but strangely restrictive placement rule, and - voila! - you have a mildly amusing family game that doesn't wear out its welcome.

About as abstract as they come, but don't let that put you off - this is a decent game that doesn't outstay its welcome at 30 minutes (on average). Even with the base game alone there is quite a bit of variation/replayability. The restrictive placement rules (draw a single land card, you must lay settlements on that type only) might want to make you slit your wrists with said land card though, when you get some really bad luck...

Not a huge Dominion fan, so that I enjoyed my first few games of this was kind of a shocker.  I look forward to many expansions, but the base game is pretty great as is.

Let me say, as someone who has lost the game pretty much everytime I play, winning has nothing to do with luck.  It's pure skill.  Trust me on on this.

I was on the fence about buying this for a long time. The game is polarizing and I didn't want to end up on the wrong side of this discussion. It turned out that my money and time investment paid out. I really enjoy the game, although it's easy to understand why some people do not.

It's utterly different from Dominion, another Spiel des Jahres winner by Donald X. Vaccarino. Dominion is a simple, but very smart game you can lose yourself in. For a Spiel des Jahres winner it is maybe a little bit too smart. Kingdom Builder is more suitable for a Spiel des Jahres game. It's family-friendly, it's easy on the mind, but not a mindless luck-fest. Thinking helps. However, since Dominion and Kingdom Builder are so different from each other, with the first being more of a classic "gamer's game", disappointment from certain groups was inevitable. 

All you do in this game is draw one card that tells you where on one of the five terrain types you build your 3+ settlements on, you have some objectives to fulfill and some special abilities you can get. That's basically it. There must be waste baskets of extra-stuff that was cut out to achieve this level of simplicity.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I can't quite explain why I don't like this, but I just don't find it engaging at all.  Maybe it's because there's an enormous board that barely gets covered, or maybe the choices don't seem that interesting, or...  I'm not sure.  But I just don't care for it.  There's something to be said for the way the scoring changes every round, and how the special items are different every round, and that fact that it plays extremely fast is a plus, but I just can't find myself interested in it.

I enjoyed it as a quick filler game for two people, but found it rather wanting for four people - the winner was decided after a few minutes and the game was not very enjoyable for the remaining half an hour (for the winner as well as for the other players). Generally, lacks theme, meaningful player interaction, and real decision-making - usually, the card you draw makes the decision for you.

One of the best gateway games in existence, and a marvel of economy of design. With very limited equipment it creates an ever changing interactive puzzle that also looks gorgeous on the table. The strategy of the game is mostly front-loaded and the game can at times be lost at the first placement. There is also a reasonable level of luck, which Vaccarino acknowledges even, but this for me is life giving and mitigable across players of unequal strength. Across equal strength players, well then either enjoy the half hour ride or play something else if you care mostly about winning. Lastly, I never thought I'd say this, but it is refreshing to not have to hold a hand of cards. There! :)

A very fun game, and one that will stay in the collection. Highly recommended.

Great game. I love they way this game scores and the replay value. Tons of fun.

I have read the comments about people who rated this less then 7 and it blows my mind. Most only played once or not even a full game. It's also not as random as one might think. Knowing now to play the card you draw is key. It takes a couple games but the people I play this with make it very competitive.

Kingdom Builder is probably the best take on the basic German route building game that I've played since Through the Desert, which is pretty high praise. Just when I was afraid Donald X was going to turn into the next Klaus-Jurgen Wrede, he's instead morphing into a Teuber, in other words, a man well known for one franchise, but with other tricks up his sleeve.

Most basically, KB features a board made up of hexes depicting various types of terrain. Each round, players draw a card that has one of those terrain types and must place 3 houses onto that terrain type. The trick is that if possible, you must place pieces adjacent to existing ones, but if you plan things out, you can fill up areas and then jump to others.

More interestingly, the game rewards players differently each time around based on 3 scoring cards (of a deck of 10) that change what you score at the end of the game. Connecting to shiny silver castles is always desirable, but scoring cards can give you bonuses for spreading out horizontally, connecting to bonus chit areas, or the like.

The aforementioned bonus chits are the other interesting wrinkle. Placing houses adjacent to these spots gives the first two players special powers that they get to use each round. Some of them are simple...i.e.: place a free house from your supply onto a desert space each round. Others are much more interesting and difficult to use correctly, such as the "move one house two spaces in a straight line each round" or "move one house from anywhere onto the board to any water space each round." The special chits vary based on the board, as the board is modular and made up of 4 out of 8 panels each game.

Though this is fairly simple on the surface, the special power chits and the need to evaluate the most efficient way to score each game makes this a real winner in my book. It almost completely obsoletes Through the Desert for me, and I thought that that was already a very solid game, albeit one that tends to get samey with repeat play. KB, by contrast, seems like it should have a much longer life because of the varied board set-up, varied special powers, and varied scoring.

Love it!  Thought this was an economic game at first glance, but it's really an area control game.  Plays very quickly, and the board/map, locations, and victory conditions are different in every game, meaning you never play the same setting twice.  I love the variety that provides, and though someone else in our group already has it, I'm definitely considering it for our own collection.

Házi szabállyal módosítva (BGG fórumból) egész jó kis játék válik belőle:
- A verzió: 2 lap felfordítva, ebből kell kiválasztani az egyiket (majd pótolni), de ha egyik sem tetszik, akkor a húzópakli felső lapját fel lehet venni. (szerencse szerepe még így is nagy, és inkább taktikázni lehet vele, azaz a lehető legjobbat kihozni ebből az 1 lapból)
- B verzió: a játék során minden játékos 3 lapot tart kézben, amiből egyet felhasznál majd eldob, végül kiegészíti a kezében lévőket ismét 3-ra. (Szerintem a B verzió jobb, és azért, mert jóval kevesebb a szerencsefaktor, illetve jobban lehet előre tervezni, így nagyobb a stratégia szerepe, az amúgy inkább taktikai játékban.)

A 2 személyes játék nagyon jó.
 
Nyelvfüggetlen, gyors, jó az újrajátszhatósági faktora (8 db térképrészletből illesztünk mindig össze 4 db-ot illetve a 10 fajta pontozó lapból mindig 3-at használunk).

This is NOT "Through the Desert on steroids" as some have described it.  (That was an incorrect comparison, repeated ad nauseum by BGG sheeple.)  The terrain cards that limit where you can build, the special abilites of the landmarks, AND the variable scoring make this into something much more.  Not better, just different.

There is a certain quality to Kingdom Builder that makes it somewhat dismissible by serious gamers.  Several aspects seem quite generic, but with a few plays the depth starts to come out.

Update: Hey! It's better if you play by the correct rules! (Upgrade thingies are permanent, not one-shots.) Still not earth-shattering, but decent. And hits a sweet spot for having a game with a random map based game in under an hour.

Tentative rating. I succumbed to a sale against my better judgment. The lack of control here is extremely frustrating. Only two games in though. But even the family (supposed to be a family game, right?) didn't dig it. Hmmm...

High time to add a comment. When Kingdom Builder (KB for short) was announced, I politely ignored it: Queen Games rarely strike a chord with me these days, and to make it worse the game even won the SdJ. Ugh, no, thanks. And thus that situation persisted until one day someone at a club made me and my partner play it: there were a few rules wrong, but we weren't really won over in any way. Not bad, not good, nice artwork, very limited action space due to the single card draw. A few weeks later we played again at a gaming friend's house, 'cementing' my views that the game was too random to be fun. So I continued politely ignoring the game again. 

Not so my partner, who kinda-liked it and wondered for how much it was to be had. Well, Amazon to the rescue: for very little indeed. To the point where she didn't mind spending the money and playing some more. The fact that it came with the first expansion helped considerably. So the box arrived, I break out the rules, read through them again, and we were off. The first game wasn't very pleasant, but in the second I suddenly noticed that you could 'steer' where your options lay in a very subtle manner my previous cursory glances did not make clear. By carefully expanding towards certain areas you could sometimes 'trick' the game into allowing you an essentially free placement of a house in an area... which would net you a good position with respect to the goal cards, or with respect to the extra action tiles. All of a sudden all sorts of vague ideas clicked into place, and I realised I was sitting behind a fairly unique game of area control (which almost never fails to captivate me), featuring varying end goals (thus guaranteeing play variability), yet rulewise light enough to be played with non-gamers while remaining interesting in a friendly, soothing way. Oooooookaaaaayyyyy. I've been playing KB with pleasure since, which can be rightly called an impressive achievement. It's not often a game manages to win me over like so.

The real clinger came when a friend, adamant KB hater, wondered whether this time I had truly lost my marbles, and asked me why on Earth I'd bought that crap. Like me, he had played the game only once or twice without full knowledge of how to actually place houses effectively. So I showed him. He now owns more KB games and expansions than me. 

KB is by no means a complex game, or a difficult one, or even a challenging one. Game-technically it is weak, with the area control and goal cards forming the most interesting aspects. But it simply [i]works[/i] without once feeling overly artificial. The rules are simple and straightforward, yet winning isn't always easy given the fickle card draw. But that is, for once, okay. If there are disadvantages, I'd say there are two: 
— Sometimes the card draw indeed [i]is[/i] very terribly lopsided. As in 'drawing four or five similar terrains in a row'. (Not less!) There is nothing you can do about this, and you will lose the game because of it. I wish that the game would be hardened a tad against this scenario.
— The base game comes with too little variation in the game goals. For more, you need to purchase expansions. This is completely unnecessary and only serves up to rack up a good purchase bill.

For the rest a solid and dependable lightweight title remains. I'm going to be a little lenient and award the game a 7 because the expansions, money sinks as they are, do give the same extra legs. Otherwise it'd have been a 6.

Recent plays with the group (all first-timers except me) cemented this in my top-10.

Light-medium strategic with random card draw and a touch of cutthroat screwage. Fun!

Enjoyable from the first draw, some frustration if your cards don't come up, but oh well - change your plans, use your tokens to their best tactical play, make do.

I lost the last game of the night by 1 pt ... and loved it. Such a close match where the final score is almost a surprise is refreshing. Instead of spending all this time gloating or being miserable about being in last place, you're out placing your guys to maximize your position ... then spend 3 minutes scoring, and whomever wins, wins!

Very pleasant experience. This is the fourth group I've introduced to - a hit everytime (including wife and kids). The varying map, powers and win conditions are fantastic - each game is fresh and each setup had a completely unique feel.

This past year's SdJ winner is one I had heard a lot about but just had no opportunity to try it.  I'm glad I finally did.  While the placement rules and bonus tiles take a bit to fully understand, once you get going it's a very fast game.

I definitely appreciate how the board and goals shift from game to game, so there is enough variety here to keep going on multiple plays.  And in a friendly environment it's natural to help other players pick out the best placements for their buildings.

Definitely enjoyable, I am just trying to decide if I need to own my own copy!

RATING: 7
A good game and worthy winner of the Spiel des Jahres 2012 award! :)
Kingdom Builder successfully adapts the variable choice of Kingdom (Builder) cards that define each game from Dominion to a board game. This and the different location tiles on the different quadrants in different positions make the game variable and versatile and thus offer high replay appeal in my opinion.

It is also great that the designer is very active and readily answer questions on these forums! :)

However, the luck factor that comes with drawing just one terrain card seems a bit too high for my taste, particularly in turns 2 and 3 which are extremely important.

RATING: N/A
A little lighter / more random than I'd like, but still quite enjoyable... and certainly much better than I'd expected after hearing lots of "eh" from people who were disappointed after hearing lots of hype. The consideration of geography is right up my alley, though I'm not especially good at it yet.

Unique game of tactics

RATING: 10
Components: Simple wooden settlements. Gorgeous board, with a few little extraneous details on the hexes to give them personality. I like the pasted on fantasy theme, but would enjoy it more if the settlements were something a bit more mobile, like horses; it doesn't make sense to have them flying all over the place.

Experience: It's fun. It's a challenge to reach the various superpowered locations, to meet the victory conditions, and to allow for maximum maneuverability. It's best to not be adjacent to a particular terrain type, but failing that, it's best to be adjacent to as many of that type as possible, to create the most options.

It's fast. Games have been coming in at an hour each so far. We're partly slowed down by having to help each other recognize and adhere to the adjacency rule, which for some reason is really tough to wrap our brains around.

It's highly modular. The intersection of different map configurations, different location powers, and different victory conditions help to keep this game interesting. We can play several games back-to-back, and each has a distinctive feel to it, with unique struggles. I love the opening of games like this (e.g., Settlers of Catan, Thunderstone) where I survey the land, trying to recognize the various vulnerabilities to be exploited.

There are a few combinations of victory conditions that really complement each other (Knights + Citizens), and some that don't (Citizens + Hermit), so part of the strategy is identifying how the objectives overlay on the board, and which locations will be of most use. The location tiles are mostly balanced, except for the boats. Boats are incredibly useful, regardless of the victory condition, and there are half as many of them as there are other location tiles. In a recent game, I was able to use my first two turns to encircle the boats location, locking out all the other players, which gave me a huge advantage; and their card draws prevented them from stopping me. Horse stables might be too powerful as well.

Luck of the draw can be damning, but the game is so much fun! Games tend to be very close, which might mean it's just a matter of luck.

Susceptible to analysis paralysis, and one player getting shut out of critical locations.

Generally speaking, I like this game.  However, sometimes one player can get lucky and acquire way more tiles than the other player within the first few turns of the game.  Then, it is highly likely that they will win the game.  When this happens, I don't enjoy the game near as much.  This has happened often enough to give me a distaste for the game.

There's just too little control to hold one's interest.  Everything is at the mercy of the cards.  Early in the game, you grab lots of powers if you draw the right cards, or few if you don't.  Then later, you get to play strategically if you draw the right cards, or not if you don't. I guess I could play this occasionally if people want, but it just seems way too light for my tastes.

An excellent medium euro game. Kingdom Builder is very replayable and easy to get into. The components are high quality and the game looks very pleasing on the table. Kingdom Builder is often critisized for being a luckfest, but after playing a few times I've found those claims to be largely unfounded. It CAN be all about luck but only if players fail their placements on the first few turns. Kingdom Builder is all about looking forward and minimizing risks. Definitely a worthy game by Donald X.

I don't think it's accurate enough to say you'll never play the same game of Kingdom Builder twice. I think it's more correct to say it's a multiple variety of games/gameplay in one box.

Also one of the rare games that does well with three players and doesn't suffer from any sort of kingmaking.

A very solid simple abstract game. Just a few rules means its super easy to teach and play with new people. Variable goals lends a lot to replayability which is awesome for a gateway game.

Een beurt bestaat uit één bouwactie en eventueel extra acties indien u bepaalde tegels heeft verzameld. U krijgt bij aanvang van het spel één terreinkaart in handen, u speelt deze in het begin van u beurt uit, plaatst drie huisjes op het overeenkomstige landschapstype volgens de bouwregels (zie onder) en trekt een nieuwe terreinkaart. Indien u een extra-actie-tegel heeft, mag u deze actie ook nog uitvoeren. Zo gauw een speler al z'n huisjes op het bord heeft staan, wordt de ronde uitgespeeld en wint de speler met de meeste punten. Punten scoort u door te voldoen aan de 3 opengelegde kingdomkaarten en door uw huisjes naast een kasteel te plaatsen.

Bouwregels :
- er kan slechts één huisje op een veld staan
- je kan enkel bouwen op gras, woestijn, bloemenveld, bos en dal
- je moet altijd bouwen aan eerder gebouwde huisjes indien mogelijk

Meh, forgettable mishmash of euro mechanics without much depth. Just optimize based on the cards you draw. Plus, it has nothing to do with kingdom building. At least it's quick.

The fact that this game won Spiel de Jahre is very surprising and consequently gets my vote for most overrated eurogame of 2012. The sinking ratings on this game should be a warning to everyone. Bad case of designer worship if you ask me.

I didn't mind the gameplay however it was severly unbalanced due to luck of drawing the right cards early on for 2 of the players.

To me this means the game is broken. While some house rules could mitigate this a bit, I generally don't like having to put them into games.

I wouldn't buy this game or suggest playing it, but I would probably play it again if asked.

The definitive abstracty wooden marker placement game for me

Good gateway game. Lack of variety over multiple plays. Not worth getting expansions as they are too same-ish.

Received in math trade (in exchange for Innovation).

RATING: 6
Not a good first experience. With two harbor tiles in the game and four players, the two players who did not get the tiles were hemmed in by water and never really had a chance. We'll know in the future to take some time to assess the opening board and the three Kingdom Builder cards before starting the game.
Update: This is a more subtle game than I originally thought. In most games, skillful play will neutralize poor card draws; or, more precisely, skillful play usually will make any card useful. You don't need the variants that give you a choice of cards.

After reading the rules, I didn't really know what to think of Kingdom Builder. I was under the impression that it would be a bit simplistic and not very engaging. But I had the same feeling when I read the rules for Dominion the first time and since that turned out to be one of my most played games, I bought Kingdom Builder without a demo game at the Spiel 2011.

As it turns out, this was a good decision. Kingdom Builder is a not too heavy game in which you try to build a network of settlements that earn you as much gold as possible. The special actions and variable victory conditions really spice things up as every turn has a puzzle feel to it when figuring out where to place your settlements in order to earn the most gold. Sure, there is luck in the card draw and you can't plan every detail, but in this regard Kingdom Builder feels similar to Dominion. By acquiring certain special actions, you lay the foundations for a strategy. It might not work as planned if you don't draw the right cards, but by using the special actions in a clever way, there is almost never a really bad card draw.

To sum it up: Every person I introduced to Kingdom Builder enjoyed the game. It can be explained in five minutes, it plays fast (~10-15 minutes per player) and the game play will keep you coming back again and again.

J'en suis à une bonne centaine de parties et franchement ce jeu est très bon dans son genre ! 

La réalisation est impeccable : le plateau est très coloré, toutes les cases sont bien lisibles et les cartes et les tuiles sont plutôt réussies. En revanche, l'immersion n'est pas un modèle du genre, mais on se prend très vite au jeu quand même. 

Kingdom Builder est principalement un jeu de placement, parfois de majorité, mais toujours un jeu d'optimisation. 
A votre tour, vous devez construire ou déplacer des bâtiments selon certaines règles en cherchant à optimiser leurs valeurs tout au long de la partie. Des actions Bonus viennent s'ajouter à votre action de base. Des cartes Personnages définissent des conditions particulières pour marquer des points avec vos bâtiments en fin de partie. 

Le tirage au sort des quadrants de jeu et surtout des 3 cartes Personnages du royaume (sur les 10 disponibles) est un vrai suspens. A peine révélés, on est déjà en train de voir comment agencer les combos des actions Bonus pour optimiser le score en fonction des cartes Personnages. Chaque joueur cherche à faire le max de points en faisant pas mal de sales coups aux autres. 

Dès la fin de ma première partie j'ai eu envie d'en faire une autre immédiatement, puis une autre, puis encore une autre... Kingdom Builder est bien plus subtile qu'il en a l'air et est très accrocheur, pour peu que vous aimiez ce type de jeu. Il est familial mais comblera aussi, je pense, les joueurs calculateurs. Les parties s'enchaînent rapidement. 

Il est en outre très facile de s'inventer de nouvelles cartes Personnages pour varier encore plus le plaisir, déjà énorme devant la très grande rejouabilité. Ce sera sans doute l'objet de futures extensions.

Lots of people seem to not like this game because of what it isn't. It's not Dominion. If you want to play a Dominion-like game, may I suggest you play Dominion? If you want a lighter, quick playing placement game that works well in a family setting, this one is lots of fun. There's more subtlety and difficult choices than might be apparent at first glance. Also complaints about lack of interactivity don't seem well founded to me: you should watch how your opponents are seeking to optimize their scoring and you should try to deny them those opportunities where possible. Kingdom Builder is not the be-all and end-all of strategy gaming, but I like it for what it is.

This game hits me in the wheelhouse in a lot of ways.  It's deceptively simple, yet there are a lot of considerations.  It plays quickly, but you can slow it down occasionally to explore a decision.  There is room for clever play.  There's a fair bit of look ahead.  There's luck, but it's not overwhelming.  Most of all, the game seems to be fairly dramatically different every time.  I can see my rating for this one possibly going up over time.

OK, I really like this one.  The basic game stays the same every play, but since the scoring mechanisms is different for each game, there's a whole lot of replay value.  Rules are quite simple and easy to get.  This is a fine game.

This game is excellent in every possible way.  Board is different every time, objectives are different every time, actions are different every time, short enough that losing doesn't hurt and long enough that you can execute an intelligent plan.  It is simply the perfect Euro.

As far as fillers go, Kingdom Builder is not bad. The placement rules and variable victory conditions do provide some measure of interplay variability and tension, and it is interesting determining what the risk/rewards are for making certain placement choices. That being said, I like to have the opportunity for a very large number of plays in my filler games, and after about 20 plays you will see most everything that this game has to offer. Granted, there are a large number of possible combinations between cards and player boards, but these are not going to add new decisions to consider, and thus is not enough for me to want to play this further.

a simple but elegant game that allows a great deal of strategy. This is my kind of game and because it is simple to teach and not too complicated I get to plate with a host of different people. It really has only one mechanic with slight rule changes depending on where you put your settlements. I enjoy this game because it allows me to sit down and get excited about my next move and what I'm going to do. Hopefully nobody will get in the way of my plans.the rules and mechanics allow for variations through the game and it has a great deal of replayability. It is a simple game and therefore has some limitations on its strategy but I had a great time playing it and it will be on my shelf one day.

RATING: 7
Players are expanding their kingdoms across a hex map of differing terrain.  Simple game where players reveal a terrain card, and must place three of their 40 houses on that terrain - one house (only) per hex.  As houses touch certain hexes, bonus action tiles are earned, allowing extra placements per turn, accelerating the game.  The game ends when someone has placed all their houses, and scores are tallied based on 3 scoring cards randomly dealt from a deck of 10 at the beginning of the game.  Very simple game in terms of mechanics, but has a pleasant "meaty filler" feel to it - plays fast, makes you think a little, a little bit of risk and luck involved, but doesn't make you flip the table in anger if it doesn't come off!  The eight map boards and different scoring card combinations keep things interesting and re-playable.  Worth a look.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
In theory this sounds like a pretty fun abstract tile-laying game: placing down houses on a modular board with different goals and actions each game. I assume that you know the rules/concept somewhat.

The problem of this game lies in the arc of the game:
- The first turn the choice is huge, because you have choice to put you houses anywhere.
- Then the turns after that feels limited because you have to put down houses next to where you have a house. That's why it's in the first turn important to put next to as little to different types of fields as possible. The thing is, that castles and towns, where you want to be first are adjacent to a lot of different types of fields (which does make it easier to connect to, but harder to connect from).
- The mid-game is more interesting as you have more choice, unless, you're like me and have drawn many of the same types of fields in the previous turns. In this stage you can finally work towards the goal.
- In the end game the board is getting cluttered up, so choices feel limited and it's more about searching where you can block somebody or try to get a point. But there are not a lot opportunities for this and there will be many turns that feel wasted because you don't score any points. So the excitement is gone and now you just feel obliged to finish the game.

All in all, fun in theory, but only really fun for a few turns in the (mid-)game.

THIS GAME HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH DOMINION.
With that out of the way, this is a very nice logistic/placement game that reminds me of a cross between Carcassone and... Dominion. Not so much that you get to build up decks or whatnot during the game, but rather in the way the game is set up (random boards, which bring about random special buildings and randomly chosen ways of making points at the end of the game).
Very simple game which thwarts AP players by giving them only one card per turn (which is the terrain type your 3 buildings need to go on to) and plenty of time to think while the other players do their turn.
Very cool and easy to teach. Fast playing too with the right group and has that "one more game" feeling.

Place houses on map to score points. In each game theres 3 of 8 victory conditions to vary what is needed. Randomly determine where on the map you have to put houses (1 of 6 areas that are multiple on map) and if possible houses must touch your own houses.

Own the Big Box edition with both expansions. 

I've played this game dozens of times with and without the expansion elements and I've concluded that I have very little negative to say about it. If you think the theme is weak, or the artwork simplistic, or the strategy shallow, well, I suppose I can do little to change your mind. 

I love the game for the variation on the map setup and the huge variety (even in just the base game) of the special abilities. Building for the randomized goals is always rewarding to me. I enjoy the nuanced set of choices afforded by the single card received each turn. 

For me, Kingdom Builder hits a sweet spot of strategy and simplicity. It's deep enough that I keep returning to the well, and simple enough that I can teach it to non-gamers. Its spot on my shelf is well-deserved.

First play impressions: light, easy to teach game. Not many tough decisions. Perhaps too random. artwork/components were functional but a bit underwhelming. The limited iconography was strangely simply but unintuitive and sometimes confusing. We were often asking "what does this one mean?" Plays fast so I don't need to actively avoid it but not something I feel the need to go out of my way for either

I have some problems with this game. 
Some are minor, like what was going through the minds of the designers when choosing the terrain types - canyons and ...flowers? Those are very strange to look at and most people will not identify them as such.
Some are bigger, like that you can get really screwed by bad luck of card draw and that you can get stuck in one corner, doing nothing.
But I still like the game for it's simplicity. You can play it with all kinds of gamers and non-gamers. The randomized set-up is cool, the special powers differ every game. Sure, after a few games you have seen them all, but the composition will most often be different. I will argue though, that not all special powers are equally strong.

Interesting game.  Ignore the initial negative comments on this one, it's no where near as random or lacking in decisions as people are making out.  After your first game you can see far more easily the mistakes of placement that you made and how you could have played better once you understand the scoring.  I did MUCH better in the second game as a direct result of understanding how to manipulate my placements and the special powers that the tiles grant you to better effect.

This isn't the deepest game in the world but there's enough there to hold your interest over the short playing time.  I can see why people are lauding this as a great light game that could become another excellent entry into the gateway game stable.

Bear in mind here that I was ready to dislike this game based on the initial comments coming out of Essen and the designer - I think that Dominion is a very well designed game but I really cannot understand the love that it gets on this site, which has definitely given me a slight negative bias towards future games by Donald X. Vaccarino even if that isn't fair.  (I feel the same way about 7 Wonders.)

The game became fascinating after a few plays.  Initial read-thru of the rules made me delete it from my wishlist.  It just sounded awful.  First play wasn't very good either.  But then you see the challenge of getting good chips early and setting yourself up to break the adjacency and card-play limitations.   And block other players in the process.   And that's when the game begins to shine.   In some sense, it is like Through The Desert's big brother, and I'm fine with that.    I don't like the boring wooden settlement bits, however.   Wish they could have come up with something better than that.   And the price.... sheeesh.   $60 retail is $20 or $30 too many.   But, a solid game that gets better and thinkier with more plays.

Endgame tension isn't equally supported by all scoring cards. For example, Farmers (build settlements in all sectors and score the smallest) is Knizian, and worked well. Merchants (connect locations and castles) was tough to pull off, and didn't.

Sometimes the build-adjacent restriction really limits your creativity if none of the special tiles of that game allow moving settlements.

In short, a random combination of rules does not guarantee an interesting game. If I play again, I think choosing the special tiles and endgame cards deliberately would be advisable.

Everything must be adjacent!

Immediately after the first play we all started seeing some of the strategy behind the game. But I think the reason I just didn't fall in love with it was too many times you think you have a good plan only to then see that one adjacent land next to some existing building of yours that forces you to then place your next three buildings in a spot you didn't want to. I can appreciate the design, but I didn't have fun with it.

I wouldn't refuse to play it, but I wouldn't push for it.

Alapban 3 házat teszünk le, de ha megszerzünk a tábláról bónuszokat akkor többet is tudunk letenni, át is mozgathatunk. HA vkinek mind a 40 háza fent, akkor a kör még végig és értékelés.

After having enjoyed our game sessions with the excellent Dominion, Donald Vaccarino here adapts the strengh of the dominion license in a tactical placement game.

Kingdom Builder offers us to developp our kingdom by placing 3 of our little wooden houses each turn in a world of a patchwork of different territories.
There is only 2 very simple rules :
 - At the beginning of your turn, you draw one territory cards. You then place 3 houses on the territory type matching your territory card.
 - As far as possible, you must place your houses adjacents to any of your previously placed houses.

The world is made of 4 big tile randomly picked from the 12 of the core box. Every tiles presents a unique configuration of territories along with different abilities we could acquire to increase our choice of actions.
The goal ? Be the onr with the most victory point at the end.
Those points are computed according some 3 criteria cards  also randomly picked from 8 at the begginning of the play.

Thus, as in Dominion, configurations will always be different from a play to an another   but still respects simple rules.
Also as in Dominion, The game mainly remains on a important part of chance that has to be managed.

Indeed, it seems that you might only suffer the card you draw every turn. But all the sal of this game is in trying to place his house to optimize every possibilities for the next card so there will always be something interesting to do next. (and that's not so easy !)

In Dominion, the deck building does not mean to achieve a one time amazing combination but rather is to increase the probability to always get a good hand, or even to mininize the chance to have a bad one !
Likewise, Kingdom challenges us to be careful not to be stuck with bad cards because of bad placement choices.

As a conclusion, as a inveterate player of kingdom, I found in Kigdom the same feeling of optimization and management of chance than in Dominion as well as a effective yet simple way to renew every play.

A excellent game I recommend strongly !


In French :
Kingdom builder nous propose de développer notre royaume en déposant, à notre tour, 3 de nos petites maisons de bois dans un monde aux terrains bigarrés.
2 règles très simples :

à chaque tour, on pioche une carte nous indiquant sur quel terrain agrandir notre royaume.
dans la mesure du possible, les nouvelles maisons doivent être accolées à celles déjà posées.
Le monde dans lequel on évolue est constitué de 4 plateaux tirés parmi les 12 de la boite. Chaque plateau, propose une configuration unique de terrains ainsi qu'un pouvoir qui nous donne la possibilité de faire des actions différentes pendant notre tour.
L'objectif ? Accumuler le plus de points de victoires à l'issue de la partie.
Ces points de victoires sont attribués selon des critères tirés, eux aussi, au hasard.

Ainsi, comme son ainé dominion, ce jeu aux règles simples offre des configurations de parties toujours différentes.

De plus, de même , là aussi, que Dominion, Kingdom builder a une part importante de hasard que l'on doit tenter de maitriser.

En effet, à chaque tour, on parait subir la carte terrain que l'on a tiré. Or tout le jeu est justement de tenter de poser ses maisons en s'assurant de toujours avoir quelque chose d' intéressant à jouer quel que soit le prochain terrain pioché (et c'est loin d'être facile).

Ainsi que dans dominion on construisait son deck, non pas pour réussir une combo une fois, mais en essayant de toujours obtenir des mains intéressantes, Kingdom nous invite à faire attention où l'on pose les maisons pour ne pas nous retrouver coincer à jouer de mauvais coups.

Pour conclure, joueur invétéré de dominion, j'ai retrouvé dans Kingdom les mêmes sensations de calcul, de gestion du hasard et de tactique, ainsi qu'un renouvellement simple et efficace entre chaque partie.

Un excellent jeu que je recommande chaleureusement !

(Ps : un petit plus, le matériel est riche et joli ce qui incite encore un peu plus à sortir ce jeu souvent !)

The strategies that emerge from the interplay between location actions and goal cards is the true heart of the appeal of Kingdom Builder. With 8 different board sections (each contains only 1 type of location), 10 different goal cards, and endless board configurations, no two games of Kingdom Builder are the same. I played about 10 games over 3 days and every game felt fresh. We were continuously discovering clever interactions between the different location actions and goals. I played with both friends and family of wildly varying levels of experience with board games. Everybody picked up the game quickly and everybody loved it.

The focus on configurability, variety, and replayability will sound familiar to fans of Vaccarino’s groundbreaking deck-building card game Dominion. Despite the different formats, Kingdom Builder shares much of the same DNA with it’s smash hit sibling. In the same way that Dominion’s many cards allow endless combinations and reward on-the-fly strategizing, Kingdom Builder’s different boards and goal cards promise a unique experience every play. Both are also quick plays; Kingdom Builder takes about 30-45 minutes per game. Like Dominion, Kingdom Builder practically begs for “one more game” with different goals and locations, so you’ll typically play 2-3 games in a session. Both also hit a very sweet spot on the difficulty/deepness curve, meaning it’s great as a gateway game for the uninitiated, but will feel right at home on the table with your weekly board gaming group (even if you want to graduate to something a little more complex after a few rounds).

But, in many ways, Kingdom Builder surpasses Dominion by feeling even more elegant and timeless. There are less rules and exceptions (and text in general for that matter, the rulebook is a scant 6 large-type pages), but not at the expense of variety or strategic depth (well, maybe at the expense of some variety). I feel like Kingdom Builder will reach the table when I would normally pull out Carcassonne.

For me, this game falls in the same category as Star Realms, meaning that the physical version doesn´t get me, but the smartphone app does.

I would not want to play this "physically", since I feel there´s a lot of luck involved. A good player may mitigate the luck factor, but if you´re unlucky there´s no way you´ll win.

That´s why spending an hour or so on the table is a coin flip, but you can enjoy a game on your smartphone in 5 to 10 minutes. If you lose because of luck, just play a new one in minutes. I highly recommend it.

Kingdom Builder is a misnomer if nothing else. Drawing random terrain cards and placing a few settlements doesn't at all provide players with the sensation of creating a kingdom. The puzzle of utilizing location powers to help your kingdom reach otherwise inaccessible territory is a rewarding one, but not enough to make up for the rest of the straightforward and monotonous game play.

This, like Through the Desert, is what I call a wargamer's euro. The key to victory is the ability to read the map and figure out where the key terrain is based on the victory objectives, the schwerpunkt, if you like. As a wargamer, I take to this game like a duck to water. :) 

It also plays pretty fast (as long as players must consciously remember to keep it zipping and not AP), like Through the Desert, and it has enough variability to keep it fresh for at least a few games.

Certain victory conditions break the game in that turn order is huge.  For example "Lords" scoring is based on the number of settlements you have in a sector.  If you are second in a sector and a later player pips you by a single settlement that is a swing of 12 (-6 to you, +6 to them) which is pretty substantial.

(Rating including expansions: [thing=117793]Nomads[/thing], [thing=137396]Crossroads[/thing])

You never really feel like you're building a kingdom, but it's a fun abstract game in its own right. Or rather, a family of games rolled into one. The core gameplay of placing your settlements is always the same: Show your card and place three buildings on that terrain. But the sets of special tiles and the different sets of victory point conditions make every game different.

Having only one card also reminds me a lot of Carcassonne, which I really like. But, like [thing=822]Carcassonne[/thing], the base game can begin to feel a bit samey after a while, so expansions are definitely recommended.

On the other hand, having tons of different boards and corresponding tiles and tokens makes setting up and storing the game more laborous to a point where the lightness of the game almost doesn't qualify this extra effort. And this is where Kingdom Builder is inferior to [thing=822]Carcassonne[/thing]. Most of the expansions in [thing=822]Carcassonne[/thing] have little or no effect on the setup time.

Kingdom Builder doesn't make a contribution to modern games in the same way as Vaccarino's previous effort Dominion did with its influential deckbuilding mechanic. Yet it is still a clever and excellent game that offers more that meets the eye.  Each game offers you a fresh challenge of goals, with a fresh combination of means to get there, and that will keep most players coming back for more every time again. While it won't satisfy gamers who are easily frustrated by some luck, there is more strategy than one might first think.  It's the game that works well for almost everyone, and deserves the generally positive reception it has received. A worthy Spiele des Jahres award winner!

Juego abstracto, en nuestro turno jugaremos una carta de un tipo de suelo (bosque, desierto...) y colocaremos tres asentamientos en ese tipo de suelo, podremos conseguir habilidades que nos dejan mover los asentamientos o meter mas en el mapa, las formas de puntuar al final de la partida son elegidas al azar de una baraja de cartas, por lo que las partidas son distintas unas de otras.

Thought this would be a game I would enjoy and I was right. Lisa and David taught me how to play and we all got really close scores.

Not a very deep or long game but a pleasant way to pass time.

Almost the perfect familiy game. Although I have only played it 10 times, I have played the app more than 100 times (without recording it here). The 10 different goals (you use 3 in each game), and the 8 different special abilities (you use 4 in each game), makes you never get tired of it. It's cool to see that such a simple mechanism (forced to play the one card you have on hand), can turn into such an interesting game. The reason it's not a clean 10, is that it seems that first time players don't really get too hooked about it. You must force them to play twice.

I have sought various Euro-style games with unique mechanics to pry Dawn away from her beloved Carcassonne. This was one that I had hoped would fulfill the role. So far, it has not. While she will play it if I suggest it, she has not yet requested it herself. She has grasped the strategic play of it (i.e. we both understand that the game is not pure luck based on card draws) but I don't think there's enough playspace (certainly not as much as in Carc) for her to embrace it.

Enjoyable, very open, very visual placement game with simple mechanics and slightly fiddly conditions. Otherwise, a race to maximise scoring in various ways. Little inter-action apart from blocking, but this is generally unintentional. 

Fairly quick, little downtime, and the final scores don't necessarily benefit the player placing more units each round. Clearly getting some of the bonus actions is important, but not so vital if you miss some. As long as you're playing optimally within your actions, you should do well.

Only played a few times on cardboard, but hundreds of times electronically. I understand people's frustration with the occasional run of bad draws, but skill or in any case experience is definitely a factor, especially given the variation in points-scoring, special power tokens, and even the board. I love the quick, puzzle-y gameplay, optimizing the draw and effectively obtaining and using the special powers. It's a hugely-replayable light-to-midweight abstract, basically, that I find always ends just a touch too soon. 'Ah, if only I could have done XYZ... Alright, let's play another round!'

Update: Gaming crack. There's a fair bit of variety with which to become familiar, but the more I play, the less I lose. Relative to complaints of luck, with some setups certain powers become especially important, and it's true that if you get blocked out of them you're likely to lose. But so far that has rarely happened, or else you figure out a way to win despite it!

[b]Light-medium game that is highly-variable (the board, the special abilities, the scoring systems all change from game to game). Highly-replayable light tactics game that is accessible for lots of skill-levels. Dry, but short and challenging.[/b]

Rating history: 10|8|6|6|8.....|6|4...|6|8......|10.....
Played 60+ times with 2, 3, 4 players.

APRIL 2016: After playing the app a ton in the past six months, and Dewald getting the KB Big Box, I decided to reacquire this as a highly variable weeknight tactics game. Very glad I did. The dryness is still there, but I'm enjoying it for what it is, and it is truly good for what it is. Also plays well across all skill-levels.

MARCH 2014: Nose dive. Just feels so dry once the novelty of new game wears off. Also, not appealing to any of the casual gamers I play with, so it's not getting played.

JULY 2013: I'm getting better at the game, but still won't rate a 10. It's like Cribbage and Dominion - doesn't wow me, but I'm always willing to play it for the challenge of playing well.

MAY 2013: I worried that this game would be too dry and abstract for my liking. Well, it *is* incredibly dry. It's also incredibly clever, and the multiple layers of modality (scoring, powers, terrain) make this one a home run.

My first impression was a 10, but the last couple games felt harsh with the large areas that are difficult to get out of. But it seems like clever play (i.e. multiple accesses) should mitigate that and maybe bring this back to a 10 for me.

This game had an uninspiring look to it.  The colors of the boards are atrocious.  Upon opening up, I was surprised by the beautiful art work on the cards.  I think the look between the cards & the board is incongruous.  But that is superficial.  

I again was surprised, because I really enjoyed the play which takes less than an hour.  Rules are few and simple. The board is easy to place pieces upon and score at game end.  The game changes depending upon the combination of various boards, and scoring conditions.  

I think and hope this game is going to get its share of play.

The game is well produced, has a short play time (c.45mins) and simple to play.  Add to that the Spiele des Jahres award and on paper this is the perfect filler and/or gateway game.

However, I'm personally not sure how to rate this one.  I didn't dislike the game but i was left with a feeling that I wasn't playing the game - it was playing me.  It appears my first move wasn't ideal and subsequent repetition picking up the same 2 terrain cards repeatedly meant my moves were not my own choice.  There was no way to mitigate this at all (due to water and mountain spaces I was effectively landlocked) until I picked up a green card.  It took 6 rounds to enable a free choice action.
I know people will argue that the initial placement was poor and they may well be correct.  That said, how many other games are more forgiving of one single 'error' and will allow other methods of mitigation.

I'm not sure this is actually a family game.  It feels like a gamers game as I imagine it could be learnt like a formula and eventually mastered by some individuals.

I've decided on a 6 for now.  If I get to play again and learn the techniques a little better I may re-rate up.

More fun then I thought it would be. Its simple and easy but it seems to be lacking something. Maybe its real choice, some turns are very forced (some being the keyword). And this is a game where your first three turns are probably the most important, which I generally dislike in games but the time is short enough that this game succeeds somehow.

Az első játék tetszett. Jó játék, de talán nem kiemelkedő. Tetszik a várhatóan nagyfokú változatosság, és így újrajátszhatóság. Tetszik, hogy aránylag gyors, és egyszerűek a szabályok. Szép is a játék nagyon. Nem tetszik, hogy menet közben fogalmunk sincs, hogy ki hogy áll, kivel is kell éppen versenyezni, kinek kéne esetleg kicsit keresztbetenni. Nomeg nem tetszik az ára sem.

RATING: 7
All too often games with only about half an hour of play time employ so many random and/or chaotic effects that there is barely a chance for good play to outsmart bad play. Kingdom Builder is different. Sure, the cards can still screw you at times, and it is in no way a given that the better player will triumph at the end but the odds aren't that bad.

The restriction of only one terrain card in hand is where it's at. Some complain that this means you have no choices and the game plays itself. I think they are missing the point. Learning to cope with that restriction and building your settlements accordingly so that you actually do have a choice where to go next is key.

The first Spiel des Jahres winner in a while that I'm eager to play more.

Fun game, but every time we play I feel like I am missing something. I feel like there is strategy here, but I'm not seeing it. Most decisions are straightforward without any difficulty, and many are forced on you. Maybe we just need to play this a few more times before I see the depth in it.

"Kingdom Builder" est un jeu trompeur. D'abord par son format. Une grosse boîte à 40 euros, avec un chevalier et des châteaux dessus, ça fait plus "jeu pour joueur". En fait non, c'est un jeu très familial abordable dès 8 ans, et ce n'est pas mentir que de l'affirmer. Mais pour la personne qui ne s'est pas renseignée, qui en sait pas que le Spiel des Jahres est remis à des jeux de cette trempe, c'est trompeur et le regard se portera, je pense, sur autre chose. Autre blague, mais "Kingdom Builder" est loin d'être le seul jeu à la faire, c'est qu'on pourrait espérer se prendre pour des chevaliers bâtisseurs. Pas du tout, c'est un jeu de placement abstrait au thème complètement plaqué (sans thème d'ailleurs, plutôt), avec des cités sautant au-dessus de montagnes, des mignonnes petites fleurs...

Mais ce n'est pas bien grave, car c'est un bon jeu. Il se joue rapidement, les règles sont évidentes (d'où l'âge minimum pour jouer) : tu pioches une carte, tu poses tes maisons dessus. En plus, il a l'avantage d'être assez "tactile" et "visuel", on se représente bien l'évolution de la partie. Simple voire simpliste, donc abordable. Mais la subtilité et l'intérêt du jeu vient des règles de pose, qui apportent quelques contraintes. Et puis des objectifs, qui vont orienter le placement de chaque joueur. Et puis des actions spéciales, qui vont permettre d'accélérer la fin de partie, de s'étendre, de bloquer un peu les autres... Bref, plein de petites choses qui enrichissent le jeu de façon subtile mais efficace. Là, pour gagner, ça se complexifie un peu pour l'enfant de 8 ans. Mais oui, il peut y jouer.

La gros atout de "Kingdom Builder", comme l'annonce le titre si judicieusement choisi, c'est sa rejouabilité. Les bases vont toujours rester les mêmes, mais les parties vont à chaque fois être un peu différentes en fonction des plateaux qui vont donner des effets spéciaux différents et proposent une nouvelle organisation spatiale, ou des objectifs qui, par leur multiples combinaisons (au-delà du fait qu'ils soient différents), offrent une multitude de possibilités. Bref, ça sort souvent car c'est simple et accessible, et ça ne lasse pas pour autant, bien que le sentiment lors du jeu évolue lui assez peu. Les extensions apportent quelques petites choses intéressantes mais restent très superflues.

D'autant que, même si on a le choix de les acheter ou non (le consommateur ne l'est que parce qu'il le choisit), les petits ajouts donnent envie, mais en même temps ça prend de la place et on se dit que la plupart des nouveaux trucs auraient pu être dans la boîte de base (pourquoi ne pas mettre 5 joueurs directement ?). Et puis le prix, s'il n'atteint pas celui de la boîte de base, reste élevé. Mais bon, l'auteur devient coutumier du fait (on parle quand même de celui qui a fait "Dominion", jeu à extensions multiples qui ruine votre budget et font hurler votre compagne à cause de la place que prennent chacune de ces extensions...), donc c'est sans réelle surprise, d'autant qu'il n'est pas chez le même éditeur et qu'on peut supposer que cette politique vient de lui (mais ne nous avançons pas trop quand même).

Enfin, malgré ce phénomène qui a tendance à vite me rebuter d'un jeu, il faut avouer que "Kingdom Builder" est tout à fait calibré pour le Spiel des Jahres, a de nombreux avantages (accessibilité, rejouabilité, subtilités) et est presque idéal pour initier des non-joueurs. Un peu de frustration toutefois pour ceux qui n'aiment pas le hasard et qui sont obligés de poser leurs cités là où la carte le leur a dit, mais le fait de devoir s'adapter à cette contrainte n'est pas inintéressant. Un bon jeu donc, ni plus, ni moins, car malgré des qualités intrinsèques évidentes, le plaisir de jouer n'est pas aussi important quae dans d'autres créations ludiques.

Weak. Game is unbalanced with less than four players. Some combinations are way overpowered for one particular player (e.g., the last one). Too limited in the early game, and in the late game the turns become slogfests because of all the extra actions that players can take. Not recommended.

Strength of the game is the varying map setups and victory conditions that create a unique problem to solve in each game.   The mandatory adjacency placement rule is a great constraint.  It is a card draw game so there is a luck element, but skill is rewarded in most games.

After many plays, this game continues to grow on me.

RATING: 9
A subtle tile placement game that scales well and affords excellent variety.
Decisions filtered through the single mandatory terrain type which must be built upon as randomly dictated by a deck are surprisingly robust. In the early game, players attempt to minimize the number of adjacent terrain-types so as not to be forced into building on one section of the board, while later players attempt to maximize terrain adjacency in order to expand as desired. This purportedly limiting one-card draw is the crux upon which this natural progression in placement goals is based, creating a great tension in taming its randomness.
The scoring conditions vary in each game, altering the value of the similarly myriad power tiles and even effectively adjusting each other's effective value as they can be pursued concurrently or exist in conflict.

Okay, I agree the game has strategic choices, which may not be evident to first-time players (even second, third timers...).

I don't mind a bit of luck in games, unlike a lot of people on BGG usually do. However, IMHO Kingdom Builder feels like a game with very limited decisions, which are just not interesting enough (for me) to invest time on it.

Tried the (physical) game some times, the Android App many times, and uninstalled it.

The variable map setup remember Tobago a bit, which is a game I enjoy. The variable victory conditions are a clever idea. The "buy one card and play on neighbour terrain if possible" mechanism is very boring, and is the one thing you do most time. The game felt totally flat not just for me, but for the entire group as well.

Maybe we are "poor KB players" (surely are). Maybe we could insist some more, but there are just a bunch of games in the same style out there we would play instead.

IMO - simple, elegant.

I'm convinced that this game gets an unfair rap. It's all about controlling your situation under extremely precise conditions. There's a big dollop of luck in it with which terrain card is pulled, but all can be mitigated through clever placement and judicious use of the special actions. It is more than a gateway game as I originally thought. It can get quite brain-burney at points! DXV manages to make a game that has an extremely simple turn structure with no fat whatsoever and yet still is a game with interesting decisions to make. Also, there really is no other game like it, making it a notable part of my game collection.

Truly horrible mechanic where you get a card and can only place houses on tiles of that type. Very little impact of strategy compared to luck.

We bought this as the original and nomads expansion were such a great deal on amazon.de

However I'm loving this game. I think you need the nomads as well as it adds much more variety and interaction to the game.

Very smooth, quick, not much downtime (which most of the time can be used for preparing own turn), streamlined rules. Nice components, lots of small wooden houses. Somewhat family friendly.

If Spiel des Jahres price would already be given this early in the season, Kingdom Builder would get it. That kind of game it is.

2013-03-26: Have played two times, and found this to be an excellent game. I suspect it will get better, with more plays.

I like the several different ways to score, and I can see there can be some good strategies, depending upon which scoring pattern is used for the game.

(Very?) light boardgame which main pros are :
- short length (45 mns max.)
- super easy mechanics
- variable board settings + scoring conditions make every game a different challenge.

One (big) con : depending on the map/objectives mix, if your are "unlucky" to draw the wrong card twice or three times in a row, there will be nothing you can do but act like a robot, with no choice and no hope to compete for victory. Can be (very) frustrating at times.

Having said that, it should appeal to a large majority of gamers and non-gamers alike - more to the latter.
I can understand it was awarded the SdJ in 2012 in that respect.

The replayability, the variability and the fun are just infinite here. The problem is that - because of the random setup - there are some situations when the game is just dull and drags. Luckily this is the minority of plays and you can always pick the cards at the start so it's almost not a problem at all.

The gema works great as an app becuase while plaing the board version it takes more time to find all possible laying places for your houses and the app just highlights them for you.

I like it.

RATING: 9
A very, very clever game that has much more depth and variety than first meets the eye. The changing boards, different scoring conditions, and special abilities mean that you need to be flexible. The limitation introduced by the terrain cards may seem completely luck-based first, but it's just one of the things that forces you to be smart and creative, rather than getting stuck on one idea.

Do yourself a favor and play at least two or three times before making your judgement. For some reason, the first game seems to feel bit 'meh' to everyone and only when you see the interplay with all the different options the real brilliance of the game starts to show.

An apparently simple Euro, but I'm hoping there is enough to it to foster continued interest.  Plays quickly, but controlling where your houses go is harder than at first look.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Place tokens on a board to achieve a predetermined (but variable from game to game) set of VP conditions. An evolution of Through the Dessert with variable points scoring conditions plus a dash of randomness driven by the draw of terrain cards that dictate where you may place your house meeples - the game would probably rate even higher if they had used Knight meeples instead! Rules are easy to follow, the bits are good quality and the inclusion of 2x the number of boards plus 10 VP criteria (you will only use 3 in each game) gives a lot of variability to each play. Very good.

Very reminiscent of Hacienda, with variable scoring conditions but much less theme. Essentially abstract. Really feels like an old Colovini game as well, like Clans. Fun, but I cannot see it rising above these older euros, which is not damning because it is new and fun. More of a brain-burner than Hacienda because of the scoring conditions. After several plays, just is not very interesting. Docked a point for boredom.

To me, this is reminiscent of Through the Desert.  But where every game has different goals, different special abilities and a different board set up.  Some goals and special abilities work better together than others and occasionally you can be impacted by some unlucky draws, esp. early in the game.  But it is still enjoyable and by being able to change up the goals/abilities it doesn't get stale.

Un gran juego para iniciar a nuevos jugones. Un control de area rápido y dinámico. Con variedad de tableros y diferentes objetivos según la partida. 
Bastante rejugable, ya que no es nada espeso y tanto el mapa como las formas de puntuar varían en cada partida.
Quizás el factor azar sea demasiado elevado para los más exigentes, ya que la construcción de edificios está limitada a la carta que robas cada turno. 
Creo que todo el que disfrute de un aventureros al tren, podrá disfrutar de igual manera del Kingdom Builder. Y eso es mucha gente.

I enjoyed the game, but there just isn't much there, particularly with 2.  

Have played this with 4-5 several times now.  There still isn't much there.  It's far from exciting, but for some reason I still enjoy it a little bit.  There is something zenlike with making the little pockets of houses.  My kids can grok it pretty well, until scoring time, which makes it a keeper for at least a little while.  I would probably never choose to play it with grownups on a serious level.

Nice!  Super fast to learn, easy to play, fast.  Done in 20 minutes on first play.  Interesting and hungry for more.  Fits a nice sweet spot for parents with young kids trying to squeeze a game in during nap time.

UPDATE after 5 plays: *Audible Click*  We get this game now.  Lots more to it than the first impression reveals.  It's got depth for puzzle-solvers and point optimizers, and simplicity for beginners and kids.  Everyone can have fun, it's not so heavy that you can't carry a conversation while you play, and it's short enough that my wife asks to play two games back to back after the kids go to bed.  A winner!  We'll add Nomads and Crossroads to the mix soon.

UPDATE after 12 plays within a couple weeks! - Nomads adds the ability to gain some points during the game rather than only at the end, and increased mobility.  Crossroads adds more endgame scoring opportunities, and increased mobility.  And Marshlands adds an area control aspect, and increased mobility.  I appreciate that each add increased mobility, but of all of them, it seems like Marshlands adds the most to think about.  Now that we've played each expansion in isolation, we're going to go back to the base game and play the heck out of that.  Then gradually add the expansions back in.  Loving this game.

UPDATE after 24 plays: [Still just playing with the base game].  Introduced this game to first time gamers. Easy to explain.  Easy to teach while playing.  Great game for having a conversation, drinking some wine, and relaxing with friends.  I love how every game feels like a different puzzle to solve and optimize.  This is a real winner!  We haven't played a game so many times in rapid succession since we first found Carcassonne (our first board game).

iOS only. While I appreciate the puzzley aspect of the gameplay, I think luck of the draw dominates the outcome of particular games too much. Unforgiving of placement mistakes. Placement errors or unfortunate draws often mean a turn isn't spent advancing towards scoring goals, leaving me feeling like I had a wasted turn. Eking out points here and there just not that much fun.

UPDATE: Warming to this a bit, but I still think it's too unforgiving to be a gateway game.

Played on iPad. Ok game with quite much cards random. You have one card in your hand, so you very much depend on what card you get. Too much I think. Although it is extremely important, very you place by card, however if you don't know you future cards it is useless. This game is just above average, I would recommend to try it before buy.

Kingdom Builder has very few rules, but it's not as simple as it looks. It's a surprisingly nuanced, fast-playing, variable, addictive treat. This is a game of limited but subtle choices. You want to accomplish what you can this turn, while creating acceptable options for future turns. Like Dominion, it's a "lighter" game that's definitely aimed at gamers more than families. Like Dominion, luck of the draw plays a huge role, but good play usually wins out. Like Dominion, you need to assess the opening setup and get off to a wise start - otherwise you'll find yourself locked into a losing position.

There is a good chance this is an 8 or 9 rather than a 10, but I can't get past the psychology that this game should be rated higher on list.  Nonetheless, for whatever reason, my gut says it is a 10 and 10 is where it will stay until I feel different.

EDIT: I lowered it from a 10, but nonetheless, this is an excellent game that has provided huge replay value for me.  Great buy!

This game is the essence of the Goldilocks Zone for me.

It gives you options, but not enough to cause AP. It has plenty of strategy, but not enough to become convoluted. It varies from game to game, but not enough to be inconsistent. It has depth, but not enough to be hard to understand.

It's also one of the few games where my colorblindness gave me absolutely no problems thanks to *stellar* color selection on components.

An instant hit with the family.

RATING: 8
Not the best game in the world. A lot rides on which terrain card you draw. However, fixing this by holding an extra card in hand might significantly influence down time. There are also turns that you have to waste scoring few to no points because you don't have strong options available.

Don't really care, though. I simply love looking for the best way to use my 3 settlements each turn. I find the game a joy to play. The fact that it is easy to teach and very quick is simply icing on the cake. I see this getting lots of play.

RATING: 7
In your turn you place houses in order to get more points which are awarded at the end of the game. They are placed on one type of terrain based on drawn cards and you have to play it adjacent to one of your previously played houses if they can (if they can't you can play it on any place on the board with that terrain).The scoring is determined by three cards that are drawn at the start of the game and castles that are printed on the boards which you want to have houses adjacent to. There are also special abilities that can be used if you have a house placed adjacent to them, which really is what makes the game interesting.

If this game would be released a few years back it would be an instant success and probably a classic game as it is elegant and attractive. Now I think that people will find the game too abstract and the theme too bland. That said, I think that my experience with the game was good and would like to play it some more.

Tentative 9, may lower rating after increased plays. Increased plays means games are less about exploring mechanics, and more about perfecting moves. Not sure if that's for me. 

If I've seen everything in the base game, maybe it means I won't be entertained by it as much anymore, even if there is variable setup.

Played 3 times all 2 player. Lovely tight, simple design. It feels to me like this game should be winning awards, a real beauty. March 2012

*UPDATE* 6 Plays, the last 3 with 3 players. This is turning into quiet a brain burner. Picking the start placement is important. Nice gravity of decisions throughout the game. This is a lot less "light" than I originally thought. We are keeping scores and I expect to play a dozen games over the Easter break before our son goes back to university. March 2012

*UPDATE 2* Rating up to a 9. 10th game, I have now played a couple of 4 player games. This game scales fine from 2-4. Still loving it. Am looking forward to the expansion. April 2012

*UPDATE* 25th playing and my Rating is up to a 10. Most plays have been 2 player but have enjoyed the odd 3 and 4 player games. My other half declared the game to be her all time favourite tonight. This is amazing. My last dozen plays have all been with the Nomads expansion.

*UPDATE* 60th playing and I'm dropping my rating to an 8. This game just might have been killed by the expansion for me. The "slide until you hit a barrier" tiles (in particular) make the options too overwhelming with players pulling short their pondering just to keep the flow of the game going.

The problem is the game needs an expansion just to keep it interesting so I am not too fussed to go back to playing just the base game. Still it's seen more plays than most games get. December 2013

Not nearly as complicated as it looks, in the same way that Through the Desert is.  As in Dominion, the variable setup is what seems like it will give this game a lot of staying power, and it made the first couple of games feel pretty different.  There are actually a lot of strategic decisions to be made for a game where effectively you're just putting down three colored cubes each round.

Sort of Through the Desert EXTREME. Players place three pieces on the board every turn, usually making chains. However, placement is restricted by a card representing a terrain type. Poor card draws can hamper your options, but the game is quick and light enough that it doesn't bother me too much.

This is the latest game from Dominion designer Donald X. Vaccarino... and the first thing that's noticeable is that, like Dominion, there's a lot of variability in the setup... with a variety of boards and a myriad of different scoring cards, only 3 of which are used in any 1 game. There's also scope for plenty of expansions.. as proved by having one already listed on BGG (which adds another player, some new boards, more score cards and new bonus tokens).

So what is Kingdom Builder all about... it's primarily a sort of area control game in which players place their settlements on locations on the board according to the type of land card they have drawn...settlements must go next to existing ones if possible, but if you have no settlements on or bordering the land on the card you have, you may start a new settlement on that land type... this allows for clever positional play. It's also very important to pick up the bonus tiles, which allow you extra options for placement every turn. Scoring comes mostly from the 3 cards drawn at the start of the game, so tactics for any particular game will be dictated by which cards have been drawn... making for quite varied tactical gameplay.

Since you are stuck with whatever land card you draw 'at the start of your turn' there is a heavy luck element, and in the game I played my first 4 turns were all the same type of land.

A very good “light” game, with very simple rules and high re-playability (a lot of different combinations of power tiles and scoring cards from one game to another).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
As a longer filler, it seems decent enough. It doesn't take too long, and there's more thinking than a typical filler, but not too much. Good for playing with less experienced gamers because the strategies are more apparent.

Some interesting combinations of scoring cards can cause more strategic planning than others. In first game we had Hermit and Citizen together, as well as Lords. That caused different players to choose divergent strategies and adjust upon seeing the others' choices.

Seems like it should have good replayability with the mix of scoring and boards / bonuses.

The high price tag for this certainly is another negative aspect. And, the usual expansion $ commitment to get more interesting options. I ended up buying the Big Box edition.

RATING: 7
Even though the game has lots of strategic options and vary in the ways you can play it, its just to easy and in my opinion gets boring after playing a couple of rounds. Every once in a while its fun to take out and play. Fast paced and not too long is good sometimes too.

RATING: 5
The five points I am giving this are for the production values of the publisher, which are very good, and for the art which is well done. Quality materials, quality box, nice insert. Pretty board, pretty box, pleasant looking cards.

And for me, that's where the positives stop. While it's interesting to find an abstract with thematic gameplay, you can see through the theme in seconds. And what you find is an area control game with slightly wonky mechanics. Yawn.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
After 1 game I would have given this game a rating of at most 5 or 6.  But then I gave it a second, third and fourth try.  And from game to game, I realized more and more how deep this game is.  Many gamers seem to underestimate the number of tactical decisions this game offers.  But believe me: It's not just "draw a card, place meeples where card says".  A game of Kingdom Builder is won by the player who manages best to minimize constraints and who simultaneously opens up new placement opportunities.  The key to victory is to carefully examine the board before every move, especially when you can freely place a settlement.  A poor move on turn 1 can ruin the game for the next 3-4 turns.  Furthermore, the extra/bonus tiles are extraordinary important as they greatly increase your flexibility.  Bottom line: Great game which would be a worthy Spiel des Jahres 2012

This is a strange beast: it is very simple and feels very light, but has some subtle strategies, and early mistakes may take players out of contention. There is a lot of variation with the special locations and the scoring cards, but not all of them or their combinations are equally enjoyable. It feels more like a puzzle and may lack tension, as there are few opportunities to interfere with other players' plans - not even a tenth of the interaction in "Through the Desert" or "Hacienda", which have slightly similar mechanics. But as the game progress and the players acquire location tokens giving them more options, more thought is required. It may be too long for a filler, but I have enjoyed it as a family game, even though the high level of luck of the draw keeps it from being more than that.

Felfedezők és Birodalomalapítók
Előre le kell szögeznem, hogy első kipróbálásra nem tetszett a játék, de adtam neki még egy esélyt és ez jó döntésnek bizonyult, így az egyik kedvencemmé nőtte ki magát.
Maga az alapszabály egyszerű: minden körödben 3 házikóval bővítheted birodalmadat a húzott területkártya típusának megfelelően. Az építésnél egyetlen egy korlátozásod van: mindig kötelezően egy már letett településed mellé kell azt letenned vagy bárhova rakhatod a táblán. Miután elfogyott valakinek a 40 kis házikója, elindul az utolsó kör és utána a pontozás. Az alapfelállást kellően fűszerezi, hogy a táblán extra kis korongokra tudsz szert tenni, amelyeket felhasználva kombinálhatod a lehetőségeidet annak érdekében, hogy a végén a legtöbb pontot te szerezd meg. Az extra korongok segítségével egy körben 3-nál több házikót tehetsz le, más tereptípusra is építhetsz, mozoghatsz tengeren,… Ezek száma véges, így érdemes a taktikádnak megfelelően a számodra leghasznosabbakat már a játék elején beszerezni (amúgy is érdemes minél előbb szert tenni ezekre, mert az extra akcióiddal előnyre teszel szert). Fontos, hogy a játék elején húzunk 3 Kingdom Builder lapot, amely meghatározza, hogy a játék folyamán a táblán (amelyet a játék kezdetén a rendelkezésre álló 8 játéktábla részletből 4-et véletlenszerűen kiválasztva mi alakítunk ki) miért is kaphatunk pontot: tenger mellé építkezve, nagy településrendszert kialakítva, felfedezve az egész pályát, … A véletlenszerűen felhúzott lapok és kialakított játéktábla biztosítja a többszöri újrajátszhatóságot. Maga a játék is elég gyors, bár az analízis-paralízisben szenvedőkkel ez nehéz ügy, mert azért meg kell találni a legoptimálisabb pontszerzési lehetőségeket. A szerencse szerepe sem elhanyagolható, hiszen a körödben húzott területkártya határozza meg a lehetőségeidet és itt Fortuna kegyeiért sem árt imádkozni. Összességében remek játék!
A JEM magazinnak hála magyar lapokkal is játszható a játék és más nyelvtudás igénye már nincs is.

RATING: 10
Instant classic. This game is fairly unique for me in that every single move has an effect on the rest of your moves for the entire game. Made a few mistakes? Don't worry, it will be over soon. This is a common element in some very heavy strategy games but the difference is the game plays so fast you can just reset and play again. 

The first time I played with my buddy he was complaining about how he was getting screwed by the cards. I told him look, its not the cards its your strategy. Soon he started to see it. I explained that how on the iOS app I lost every game against the medium AI when first starting. Now I win 80% and the other 20 are usually within a few points. If the game were entirely dependent on luck of the draw it would have been 50/50 from the start and continued to be throughout.

As you progress into the game it takes a great deal of planning to beat an expert player. Every settlement you put down must be considered. Every additional action taken with care. There is no room for error once everyone gets to this level. I simply can't say enough about this game. I will note that I am a big fan of puzzles, and this definitely plays to that.

Before my first game, I already thought it would be a pointless game, not meant for me, but when I played it, it was even worse.

There's no depth and it looks very unbalanced, due to the tiles players can pick up. Some may be able to get 3-4 of them, while others (probably the last player) don't get any at all.

RATING: 8
A pretty fun and novel game.  There is limited interaction between the players especially with fewer players (2).  However, the game is still fun and interesting.  The interaction is more in the fact that your objectives conflict and you augment your play to score better but your pieces rarely interact.

The cards are pretty balanced except for one, the hermit card, which is almost irrelevant compared the others as far as scoring goes.  I do not understand how it made it into the game.  Especially when looking at the expansion it should simply be removed.  Unless I am completely missing something.  Perhaps if it were worth something more substantial like 5 gold per settlement instead of 1, it would be viable.

A solid but uninspiring light train game.  The rules are simple, it is very fast, and the special powers and variable victory conditions are clever and provide a lot of replayability.  Frankly it feels like Through the Desert with a lot of the decision points removed, which could be a big plus or a big minus based on how much you like through the desert.  Kingdom Builder has two big flaws in common with dominion.  The title of the game doesn't match the game play, and after the first couple of turns the rest of the game plays itself.  I guess route builder didn't sound exciting enough but after hearing the title kingdom builder I thought this would be a light civ game of some kind.  Also after the first maybe three turns your board position is mostly locked in and each turn you are presented with an extremely limited number of choices, which are easy to optimize.  Dominion had similar problems.  

My biggest gripe about this game is the weight.  It is too light for serious gamers, with no hand management aspects and a very limited number of choices on your turn.  On the other hand I can't see busting this out with non-gamers since all the special actions, scoring conditions, and possibilities of card draw frustration won't sit well with them.  I think its in a bit of a no man's land and really only appeals to "optimization" gamers.  

The game design is solid as a train route game with variable victory conditions... it just doesn't overcome its own flaws.  Perhaps the expansions will add enough meat and potatoes to this meal to make it filling, but the base game just doesn't do much for me.

Coming from the designer of Dominion, all the expected stuff is here. It's highly accessible, plays quickly, and features a setup that uses only a randomized portion of cards each time to ensure variability. However, there is nothing as groundbreaking as the deckbuilding mechanic that Dominion introduced. Yet it should not be unfairly overlooked.

Each turn, a player will place 3 of his houses onto the board, but must do so onto one specific type of terrain (randomized each turn). The arrangement of the houses will vary based on the randomized goal cards of the game. For example, you might get points for placing in a row, or placing on different sections of the board. Sometimes the goal cards will work together, and other times they will be in tension. It's a very simple rule structure, probably on the level of Ticket to Ride. And like Ticket to Ride, it gives players a decent amount of depth in terms of the choices they have to make. Players will need to watch what their opponents are doing and adjust accordingly, yet it is not a confrontational game; it is more about jockeying for position and winning various point categories.

Kingdom Builder has plenty to offer as a gateway game. It hits a sweet spot of simple rules with meaningful choices. In short, it's exactly what a Spiel des Jahres winner should be, and would be a welcome addition to the collection of any gamer who enjoys this weight of game.

I think this is a good short game with great replayability.  With only 3 scoring goals (plus 3 points for building next to a castle), it's easy to teach and easy to focus on what's important.  I love that the scoring goals and maps are random each game.  Even this limited randomness (plus the randomness of the cards that the players draw) gives the game a good mix of coming up with a strategy at the beginning, and dynamically reacting to the tactics of the other players.

With only 40 houses, the game will end in at most 14 turns, and usually more like 10 turns, so it's about 30 minutes long with 4 players who know the game.

Connection games seem to be a right of passage for designers looking to make their mark on the gaming world. Not because "everyone is doing one" but rather because it's such a tried and true that has also become a trope that it becomes an interesting challenge to breath fresh air into this medium (especially after so many good games of this sort are already out there). Vaccarino achieves this in Kingdom Builder by proposing a short game which (importantly) inverts the game space: first, he provides only one type of terrain per move; and second, due to the way placements happen, you are invited not to expand your options too broadly (i.e., you are required to place further pieces adjacent *if you can* - key words). After that, the game feels Vaccarino-esque, there are variable abilities you can gain to build a bit of an engine, scoring opportunities against which you must balance 'engine building' with, and variable end-game scoring opportunities. This creates a short and sweet game which straddles between the unassuming simplicity of older spatial games and the contemporary bloat of SEPCAIL PWOERS! SECERT OBEJCTVIES! multiple special texts.

Somewhat like Through the Desert, with some special scoring to keep things interesting. Your placements are constrained by the card draw, yet somehow it doesn't seem to add too much luck to the proceedings. It's so short and quick moving, it's easy to play several games in a row. It made a great first impression and though I've cooled on it slightly, I still enjoy it.

This game is a bit filler-tastic, and I'd say not remotely worth the Spiel des Jahres- that being said, its' a good game, but with the rules as written (one terrain card) it basically feels like it plays itself

The lack of choice in where to go further exacerbates the fact that some of the chits you can get are so much better than others

We play with the ability to always have two terrain cards in hand and choose from one (keeping the other and drawing a new card) and the game feels *much* stronger with that rule, easily an 8- but I'll rate it according to the published rules at a 7

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Typical example of simple rules yet somewhat deep strategy. The modular boards, the obtainable bonus tiles and different scoring aspects makes your decisions hard. The game itself is great but you can only build to the territory you have drawn from the deck. This gives huge luckactor into it especially when you only need one or types of all. Okey you might build in all of the land types but to be equally good in each terrain it is almost impossible to achieve. I don't if this comes with skill from repeted play but i was waiting for two types a half game to connect my cities but the needed type never shown up.

This game is not poorly designed in that there seems to be nothing broken or absurd, but there isn't much fun here, IMO. You can get really forced by repeated card draws that are the same and forced to play in the same areas. That's not necessarily a deal killer, but this is as dry as sand, mechanical, and I might refuse to play if a gaming group wants top play this (which is a rare thing for me as I like most games). If you like it, great, but I find it all dull mechanics.

Fun for the whole family. My 5 year old loves it. We only play with one set of goals (Knights - longest line, Citizens - big group, and Merchants - connect locations) so he knows how to score points.  We keep to the base boards as well, so there are less extra actions for him to figure out. But now that he has played it 4-5 times he is starting to really get it.

Even playing in its "kids" format, its not a bad game.  It's far better than the brain numbing Candyland genre.

I was expecting something novel from the designer of Dominion, but this is not the same groundbreaking event one would expect. It is admittedly different and intriguing, with area control taken up another step. It plays fast, with little downtime, emphasizing a very focused set of choices. We enjoyed it enough to play again, but it was clear that we hadn't fully grasped on how to play well the first time. I'd be up to trying this again. For now, it is a '7'.

My first board game. Pretty fun, if basic. Works just as well with 2 players as with 4.

RATING: 8.66
There are a few games that are feel-good games for me. [thing=119432]Snowdonia[/thing] is one; [thing=40628]Finca[/thing] is another. [thing=122298]Morels[/thing] and [thing=123540]Tokaido[/thing] almost are but don’t quite make it.

Kingdom Builder and [thing=70919]Takenoko[/thing] hover right at the border of this boundary and I think the reason they don’t sit squarely within it like Finca and Snowdonia is the same reason Tokaido and Morels sit just outside it: depth of play. Snowdonia and Finca both incorporate their share of unknown factors, but they are decidedly susceptible to thinking ahead during play. Morels and Tokaido both allow degrees of thinking ahead, but their depth of play is foreshortened by their simplicity.

Kingdom Builder flirts with just this. It’s undeniably simple, and you certainly don’t play your cards: You play the board. The whole game is playing the board. Because you know that the cards will send you sandstorming across the landscape like bugs from an upright fan, sticking where you hit. So you want to aim where on the wall you hit. You want to make surgical strikes, in and out, darting in as close to a special bonus ability as you can and darting out again to another as soon as possible.

But everywhere you hit, you stick. And the more types of terrain you adjoin yourself to, the stickier you are. And where you stick, you ooze until you fill up the available terrain. Pray God you didn’t join yourself to another type of terrain, because there you are again, then. You want one way in, one way out, nobody sees, nobody knows. And since somebody always sees and somebody always knows, you’re stuck hopping into small ponds of terrain and out again, or toppling, Sovietlike, from terrain to adjoining terrain, sprawling across the board like a walking catfish drawn to nomad camps.

Scoring cards help with this. Once you consider that they (generally) simply identify quads or lats as additional locable goals on the board, you realize that they’re easier to hit than bonus tiles, and prioritize accordingly. But since bonus tiles let you rush the end of the game by placing additional settlements, it’s tempting to get caught up in the fun of placing a third of your remaining settlements in a turn. But if you aren’t placing them in scoring areas, you might as well have spared yourself the bonus tiles and concentrated on filling scoring conditions.

It’s a lot to think about for a game that consists in drawing a card and playing it. The game is what it is meant to be I think; it could bear a little more mental burden and move up into my group of choice feel-goods—exactly why [thing=188]Go[/thing] is at the top of that list—but I’m not dissatisfied with it as it is. As long as expansions keep on bringing more of the same, I’ll keep buying them.[color=#ffffff]a9Z4MnAx[/color]

One turn into my first game and I realized just how many things there are to consider in this game.  While randomness plays a factor in the game, the majority of games will be won or lost based on strategy.

You must build 3 settlements on the land type you drew that turn. If any of your settlements are adjacent to that land type, you must build adjacent. As a result if you don't pay attention to where you build, you may find yourself shoe-horned into a particular area, building settlements that don't do anything useful.

It's so easy to get caught up in "I'm going to build here and use this token to move a house to there so I can get another special token" etc, but it's the goals that give you the points, not who collects the most special power tokens.

An inferior version of Through the Desert that simply serves to demonstrate what a great designer Knizia really is. It works well enough, there's plenty of variety in the board and scoring options, but the luck factor in which terrain card you get (and you only get one at a time) can be huge. Some of the special action tiles are interesting, I especially like the one that allows a settlement to move two hexes in a straight line, others are more variable. This has grown on me to some extent, but it's well short of a purchase.

A cute little game that gives me an idea of what a Donald X. game really is.  I enjoy the kind of game that seems to place strict constraints on what you can do and encourages you to find clever ways around them, and that's exactly what this is; the game is about manipulating your placement such that you will be able to spread over as much of the board as possible. I also enjoy the game's modularity, with the different cards and abilities. There are two drawbacks; I wish I could play the game with more than four, and I wish that it didn't have so much downtime--sometimes it does take a while to calculate out the possibilities. Yes, I realize these wishes are opposed to each other.

Un juego abstracto razonablemente simple cuyas mecánicas principales (control de áreas, setup aleatorio y poderes variables) recuerda mucho a Hacienda o A través del desierto. Tienes que construir (build) asentamientos de tu reino (kingdom) para lograr PV's y "el toque mágico" está en las condiciones de victoria, que varían de partida a partida. No esperes nada complejo, rico o épico, porque es un Spiel des Jhares; más bien es rápido y fácil de enseñar y aprender. Me encanta el modo que combina 3/10 condiciones de victoria con 4/8 poderes especiales en 4/Muchos terrenos distintos y como la colocación inicial de los tres primeros asentamientos marcan tu ritmo de partida.  PROS: En función de las condiciones de victoria se juega como solitario multijugador o con mucha interacción. CONS: Sin tema. ¿Terreno "de flores"? Aleatorio y con mucho azar (tanto como Dominion, Backgammon o Yspahan). Al igual que Carcassonne o Alhambra, da la sensiación que es un juego bueno, pero que necesita de sus expansiones para ser interesante. Hacen falta 6 partidas para valorarlo bien y no todos están dispuestos a ello.

NOTA: es mejor barajar las losetas y escoger los tableros que no al revés. Da más sensación de aleatoriedad.

The Dice Tower crew is wrong. Kingdom Builder is fun. I was very surprised, having avoiding this game for a long time after viewing unfavorable review YouTube videos. Kingdom builder is a gateway game level victory points optimization puzzle. A tasty points salad. Can I make better choices than my friends in the sequence with which I place my houses on the board? I enjoy this challenge. Kingdom Builder is now old enough to remove it from Dominion's shadow and evaluate Kingdom Builder on it's own merits. I enjoy how the board is setup differently every game with different bonus tiles and different victory points conditions--all of which provide tremendous replay value. Kingdom Builder has good production value with thick cardboard bits and attractive art. All of my favorite games are multiplayer victory points maximization puzzles. Kingdom Builder happens to be low on the game weight scale. It is a fun game. Lighter games have a place and play an important role; I don't want to play heavy brain burners exclusively.

Degree of luck of the draw can make this game a bit frustrating.  Simple mechanic makes it a good gateway game, fast, simple to score, and stays interesting the whole way through.  Strategy can be limited by luck, often turns into a point counting mind grind near the end.

RATING: 8.5
After a little initial skepticism, I've come to find Kingdom Builder a great abstract area control game (most closely related to Go in my mind). To make it enjoyable, it's critical to grasp the idea that you must keep your placement options open by restricting the terrain types adjacent to your settlements. Once you've mastered that, there's a world of strategies and combos to puzzle over. Well worth owning and playing regularly. Recently, I've been playing a lot on BSW.

Not a bad one. It is light abstract strategy game but the restrictions could be very annoying. I love abstract games where you may develop a strategy but Kingdom Builder has much tactical moments not strategic ones. I would suggest it to who are searching a family strategy game but i actually dont think it is a must buy.

Kingdom Builder is a network city building game with simple rules. Because the game has easy rules, this game can attract games easily and smoothly. The first impression of the game is very good. Because of the card limit on players action, players feel kind of tightness on strategic management. This game is good for family members, boardgame new comers and someone who doesn't like complicate rules. Of course, the game also provides profound tactical choices and maneuvers for proficient players. For this reason, Kingdom Builder is also not suitable for the game between skilled players versus newbies. Without any reason, this game is not my cup of tea. I've already sold the game away.

I fell in love with this game after playing the ipad app - the app  unfortunatly is a little buggy which prompted the quick purchase of the game. I'd love to play the game with some more experienced players, as I seem to be playing quite well. The stratagey is deceptivly deep.The components are also really beautiful.only gripe is that a bad initial placement can be difficult to overcome - 1st move is definitely the most important.

I liked this a lot better than I thought I would from the reviews I've heard.  It's basically an abstract game with random boards and scoring cards.  Some turns, you really don't have any choices to make, but on many turns you can.  it plays quickly, and was interesting.  I'd play it again, but I won't seek it out for my collection, as I prefer heavier games.  Update: Played twice more, still feel the same. Good game that I enjoy for what it is, a lightweight short abstract game.

First – ALWAYS play with 2 terrain cards in hand instead of 1.  This makes a good game a GREAT one.
The original rule of playing with just 1 card in hand is absurd and the stubborness of Vaccarino sticking to it is even more so.

Back to the game: KB is an abstract, quick, simple (sometimes not) game with just right amount of decision-making compared to the playing time.  

I cannot emphasize enough how big replayability and variability is built-in.  Every game can be a TOTALLY different experience.
And I can imagine tons of future enhancements on top of that.  The game is a perfect base for them.

Bokkensprong 19/10/12 met Ward (bijna 8) en Kobe. Vrij eenvoudig spel v Vaccarinho, maker v Dominion.

Per beurt steeds 3 nederzettingen zetten, aansluitend aan bestaande indien mogelijk, of elders indien het niet anders kan. Wisselende speelbordvelden en manieren om punten te verdienen (je neemt per spel slechts 3 v 10 mogelijke kaarten). Speelduur 45 min, goed te doen voor 7-8j. Genomineerd voor Gouden Ludo 2012.

I'm surprised how many people dislike Kingdom Builder. I do understand some of the complaints about luck of the draw, but I find skilled players can almost always circumvent bad card draws with thoughtful play.

Another excellent game system from Donald X that proves dominion was not a one off. The variety in the box leads to lots of replayability and the decisions are often tough. Occasionally your decisions are made for you as a result of previous turns but this is a minor factor in such a fast moving game. This is easy to teach but there is some nice depth here and this was a great spiel des jahres winner. I look forward to seeing what the expansions offer.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (November 2012)

This weekend I managed to play two new games from Vaccarino. Infiltration and this one. As I love Dominion, I was keen to play Kingdom Builder. I wasn’t expecting a heavy game as Kingdom Builder won the Spiel des Jahres this year (2012) and I was right, otherwise I would have been disappointed.

As a friend was explaining this game to me, I thought I would not like the game, however when we played it I found that I do like it. It is a very simple game to teach and learn, however it has more depth that I initially thought. It has a lot of luck of the draw, but I feel the player with the best strategy will usually win it more times than not. It still remains a light game, not one I want to play often but I would play it from time to time. The game plays fast enough.
 
Theme wise the game is very weak. As with Dominion and Infiltration, the game has a huge replayability factor, as you play with different goal cards and tiles each time, each game is different and that is a very good thing in my book.

For me, Kingdom Builder is reminiscent of Trough the Dessert, but with less tension as you have so many space to settle.

A game I will play again, but not one I feel any compulsion to own.

After another play, I found I was wrong. The luck of the draw is very prominent on this game making me lower its rating. 

I won’t pursue more games of KB, and I will offer some resistance to it. Most probably I will buy it for the iPad to play it quickly, but this is not a game I like.

Kingdom Builder was a pleasant surprise of BGG.CON 2011 for me.

As anyone reading my other comments, or my profile, or my ratings, can tell, I'm not exactly the best test subject for 30-minute games.  In general I find the tradeoffs in depth of theme and gameplay necessary to get a game to that timeframe to be unacceptable to my tastes, and prefer 2+ hour games instead.

If any short game deserves a try it's one by Donald X. though.  And while I find the game play a bit too constrained by the terrain cards, the varying victory conditions ensure that Kingdom Builder will be highly replayable.  There are also interesting tactics around deliberately running yourself short on adjacencies to a particular terrain type to ensure access to new parts of the board.

A good game.

The fact that this game will change up via board and goals from game to game makes this wonderfully interesting to me.

Light family game where you draw a card to find what terrain type you need to place your houses on and maybe do a special action if you have acquired one. The game plays until someone runs out of houses. 

The game has a random board setup and scoring setup to add some variability. However, the game really does come down to the cards that you draw on your turn since they limit your ability to play houses to the board.

Not a whole lot to think about in this one but on the bright side it does play fast.

Update: After several more plays the game has begun to grow on me and I don't find the cards to be asa much of a hinderance as I originally thought.

Light family game of building territories for points. The game's saving grace is the variety in mixing up game boards and different point-generating conditions from game to game - otherwise it would get old real quick. Not sure if this is a game for a game night of seasoned gamers - not quite enough control - but I like it with my kids and fans of light games. That makes it worth keeping. On par with Ticket to Ride in depth and audience.

**UPDATE** Oh my, how this game has grown on me. I now think this game does indeed work with gamers and I look forward to playing this every time with anybody. Just one of those games I have gained a possibly irrational affection for!

Engaging fast-playing abstract with a nice touch of theme (think about the same level of theme integration as Carcassonne).  I like how Adam78 puts it: "This is an abstract game, with a beautiful atmospheric setting."

Huge game-to-game variability due do different boards, different powers and different scoring rules in every game.  I enjoy games that have "emergent properties" such as the overlapping trios in 7 Wonders and the organically created landscape in Carc.  This game has as nice an emergent landscape as any game I've seen since Carcassonne.  Beautiful, lush production by Queen Games, wonderful board and cards.  

Initially 8.2, upgraded to 8.5 after 10 plays, as it has really grown on me.

After 16 plays, upgraded to 8.8, liking this more and more.  I love old maps and historical settlement distributions, etc.  And this is a fun way to kind of recreate that, kind of like the "build a dungeon" game.  You can see how your peoples spread through the land if they were Miner Hermits, etc.  I like how lots of thought has been put into the terrain patterns on the boards so that they get put together in interesting ways; "valleys", chains of mountains, etc.

Kingdom Builder is a deceptively simple game, there is much more depth than may be apparent on a first glance.

The constraint of a one card hand seems needlessly punishing and limiting, but I would argue is the crux of the entire game. Setting yourself up to make use of any card is at the heart of good game play, and can be quite challenging. It also creates interesting design space for special abilities. By limiting player choice in which terrains they can access Donald is able to have a suite of subtle special abilities which would be useless if players could freely choose which terrain to place on.

Of course the system does allow for good and bad draws, and as such, players sometimes feel at the mercy of the draw. The more skilled you become at the game the less of influence this has.

There are two modular systems which create a vast array of variety between games. The first are the special powers in each game you use 4, and the second are the shared end game scoring conditions of which 3 are selected each game. Understanding the interaction between the powers and scoring cards is paramount to playing well. The value of a given power is affected by which other powers and which scoring card are in the game.

Each time I play the game I learn to appreciate it a bit more. I was fairly dismissive of the game after my first play. Now that I understand the hidden depths I am always willing to play. The game offers a lot of interesting decisions with a short play time.

Sometimes variety just isn't enough. I appreciate that Kingdom Builder presents a different map with different bonuses and different scoring criteria every game... but the core of it, the plunking down of settlements, just doesn't compel me. It feels too dry, too abstract.

Very dependend on luck. Not many options during the game, no decision making - does it even make a difference which person plays? Long waiting time since the card (hence the possiblity of the turn) is only revealed at the beginning of the turn and you can only start to plan (kind of the wrong word here - it's rather look and see what you're doing) at this point - whereas other players are waiting. Maybe for children/families?

I'm not a big fan of Dominion but Kingdom Builder with its spatial aspect sounded interesting. First I was surprised that it was way more abstract than I expected. That's all there is? Still, I enjoyed the game somehow and after a break of a year or so continued playing to discover the deep game hiding behind the dry front. The expansions help a lot in adding variation.

[b]Quick Review:[/b] My experiences with it has always been two players. And with that, I've found it to be too "out of the way". It would be better if players were competing over the same tracks of land, but with two players, it often feels like "this is my area, that's yours".

RATING: 8
There is no way that people were not going to be disappointed with Kingdom Builder after the runaway success of Dominion.  While Dominion was completely new and fresh, creating its own genre of games, this feels very safe and familiar - a type of game that we've all played before.  But I like the variable score cards and buildings.  I think that there is a lot of variability to keep it fresh.  But I especially like the ease and speed of play.  I hope to keep enjoying it - I feel like I might be a bit too generous in my rating, but it definitely reflects my desire to play, which is higher than most.

RATING: 8.5
Upon reading the rules, I thought the game was too simple, too dry and a typical Euro. It kinda is, except that if you play multiple sessions at one go, you start to realise why its so good.

With constantly changing victory conditions, players have to evolve their gameplay style. If you play a single game, you won't be able to appreciate that the test of a players skill is in adapting to the changing maps and cards. You can never play the same way twice. I almost want to say "its like playing just 1 game of Dominion". The game shines when you play multiple times.

The biggest downside to this game is that you are quite often a victim of the terrain card draw. If there was a way to mitigate it, it would be a top ten game.

Relaxing easy going game with tons of replay value. 

I raised my rating on this one after a couple more plays, it really is a great game.

5/27/2016: This game offers a deep game play that isnt immediately obvious. Although there is a degree of randomness that can make the session frustrating or difficult to achieve victory (drawing the same terrain card turn after turn for example), you really work on mitigating that by initial placement and the variable powers that are available to the players. Fun game with lots of variety.

I'm generally predisposed to liking games where you put tokens in hexagons, but I didn't really feel it in my first two games of Kingdom Builder. Obviously no one said we're talking about some sort of Chicago Express here, but it's not just the moments where it's thrust in your face that drawing one terrain type can mean all but a wasted turn whereas another would have showered you in riches, or how, when you've finally drawn exactly what you need, the wrong player turning up the wrong card can block you out of everything good, or even how, when these things have happened to you, they can [url=http://www.mspaintadventures.com/sweetbroandhellajeff/?cid=001.jpg]keep happening[/url]. You can learn to plan for all outcomes and secure flexibility, but then it seems like the crucial part of a game will be the initial race for whichever abilities match the scoring goals in force (try not to be seated last), followed by thirty minutes or more of sequencing the abilities you were able to grab... and in the end it still boils down to the cards.

There's an impressive array of modular elements, but while this is good for replayability it also seems almost like a cop-out: "Here, we couldn't decide which ruleset makes for the best game so cycle through all of these variants." Like an automated game construction kit that may or may not spit out a finely tuned scenario every time you press the button. Perhaps there should similarly have been a number of card drafting, hand management and turn order manipulation systems to add to the permutations.

Will play again to sample some more permutations.

Kingdom builder is a decent Abstract placement game that feels nice and Puzzly. The variability is fun to explore between the modular board and the scoring conditions. I definitely think it is best at max player count (5 with expansion) and think it better with a card pool to draw terrain from (sim to Ticket to ride). Nothing special but certainly simple and neat.

2015-10-17 - 6 - That's really quick game, with sometimes interesting choices. The theme is non existent there. It's a solid 6 which means I don't mind to play it from time to time, but not too often.

2016-05-23 - 6->6.5 - I played few more times and 6 is not enough for this game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I was entertained playing this one (I even won the one time I played it), but I am not sure it is something I want to play often.  You place houses (settlements?) on a map with varying terrain based on a terrain deck that often limits where you can place your pieces.  Some locations give you new abilities or scoring rules, so there is added variety to the game that way.  Again, a game I had fun with, but it is also quite dry, which is a bit of a turnoff.  I am one to aim for a lot of theme in my games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I had this initially as an 8, having now played it a couple more time I am upgrading it to a 9. Interesting decisions, very variable due to only using 3 of the 10 kingdom builder cards each turn, along with using only 4 or the 8 boards each turn. 

Enjoying it a great deal and maybe my second favourite release of 2011.

Plus Capitol, Caves promos.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
There is just so little decision-making in this game.  You have the same objectives as everyone else, and your whole move is dictated by the one card you draw.  The special powers help a bit, and I admit that it was fun to try to figure out ways of circumventing the "must place adjacent to yourself" mechanic.  Still, though, I felt like there was very little I could do to change the course of the game for myself.

I thought I'd love it because of the comparisons to Settlers.  Alas, the only similarities were the presence of hexes and wooden houses, and the card style.  Kingdom Builder has none of the infinite variation and ever-changing strategy of Settlers.

This one is hard. It's quite abstract and the theme lacks even more with certain goals in the game. 

Additionally it can happen that the selection of goals and maps leads to a dynamic game, where you really can be creative or that your turns are more stagnant and it all feels quite dragging. Compare it with a basketball game, where you play against a D'Antoni team or a Fratello team. Both can happen.

A great and relatively quick bit of territory-claiming, the randomly-dealt powerups and goals shaking each game up in occasionally surprising ways.

Great game, but fell flat for me albeit only with a few plays. Direct opponent interaction is somewhat low, and incidentally occurs when fighting over powers / castle points. Cards just add too much variance to the game as your placements are based solely on luck of the draw. There are strategical elements and powers to counter act these but balance doesn't seem to come through for me. The game plays very quickly which is a good plus as it can act as a filler while still having a full game feel. Will hopefully be able to try the upcoming expansion and re-evaluate.

This is my "thinker" game. I play it on tablet a lot, when I don't have an opponent. The concept is easy to understand, very difficult to master. It has MASSIVE replayability, the quadrants of the board are always randomly selected, so the map is always different, as well as what scores points, is always 3 conditions that are randomly selected. Would be ranked higher if I felt it could appeal to a wider audience.

Kingdom Builder is a unique game, one that only gets better with more plays (dozens of real life plays and 600+ online plays so far for me).

With a first glance Kingdom Builder might seem a luck heavy game of placing pieces where the cards tell you to. This is far from the truth. In reality Kingdom Builder is a unique engine building game, where the goal is to build a situation (using clever piece placement and special tiles) where you can draw any card and still score big points. Once you get your head around this, Kingdom Builder offers both strategic and tactical challenges and plenty of tough decisions.

Some interesting worker placement and area control mechanics. The constraint of adjacency can be challenging to work around and, as an inexperienced player, I felt like I was falling into that issue much more than others, so there is certainly some skill here. 

The beginning of the game is pretty wide open, but after a while, we all get locked down in our areas, even with the various abilities that allow movement. Feels like the Nomads expansion is necessary to make the base game more interesting.

The rules posed good restraints, but I felt like there was not much interaction with other players (where they foiled my plans, blocked me off, etc) and overall the experience lacked excitement.

Playing time is great

after logging numerous plays on the ipad. I played two games tonight with my fixed gaming group. My respect has grown as the gameplay is just so easy with players being involved. hence a rating upgrade to 7.5.

Luck of the draw plays a huge part though . I am okay with it now as the playing time is so short.  And you can try to mitigate it with the special powers.


However it doesn't stand out or wow me.
i've got the expansions and am curious if they change the game to make it more a gamers game. i haven't got a clue :)
i'm surprised games like forbidden island , which is clearly a family game and not a children's game wins the Golden geek in childrens games. I would be less surprised if this won the children's award... However if you have kids take a look at the many haba games and ravensburger is paying attention to the kids also...

A game that initially disappointed me because it wasn't Dominion, but that I've come to appreciate more and more. I almost like it more than Dominion now. Dominion has better expansions though. Simple rules, but interesting choices and fun gameplay. If you think this game is random because of the 1 card draw then you just don't understand it and would probably get crushed by anyone who does understand it.

(Based on 1 play at essen) Nice game, good quality component, easy to teach/learn, I guess ok/high replayability. too light for my taste doh, kind of feel like Through the desert, but without the camels, so slightly under it for me (really personal opinion...). Basically, nice but nothing new nor that will attract me to buy it. But I wouldn't refuse a play.

First impression: Manhattan meets Through the Desert. Manhattan (which I would prefer over this anytime) with a hand of one that is.

Update (3 -> 4): Ok, it's not THAT bad. The setup can vary a lot, so I see the potential fun sometimes, when it gets tight, and the special powers can be used for diverse tactics, but it can be dull as hell and completely down to the first couple draws with some setups. At least it's short.

RATING: 5.5
Definitely not much of a kingdom builder: I expected (hoped for) it to be more like a resource management/development/exploration game, but it wasn't that at all.

Instead, if you're into abstract placement and area control, it'd be right up your alley. Also, it plays quick, which is great for its relative simplicity.

Disappointing for me but liked by some of my friends, especially since it's pretty light. There's a lot of luck involved, but allowing players to have a small hand helps add more choice to the matter (like it does for Carcassonne). Otherwise, the game rules can sometimes play themselves, especially once you understand the general strategy.

Nice lite euro that improves on some of the dryness of Through the Desert (ha ha). The randomness of terrain types can completely shoot you in the foot and destroy your strategy, so it would be nice to have some more strategic variants (like draw 2 keep 1) for those of us who like a little more control.

Played once, 4p.  Much better than I expected, since I don't like too many Donald X games.  One player really hated it, and I understand why and semi-agree - the combination of special tiles and scoring conditions can be degenerate, so that a couple of players get a huge advantage by luck.  But this is really a very quick game; this is almost suitable for a double filler.  From that point of view, it's acceptable/good.

I played my first game with the nomad expansion, but I am still going to make my review here.

It's a typical stuff placement/connection euro game similar to many other euro games. But the major feature of this game is the replability why I have to agree is interesting.

EAch game, you use 3 different cards that tells you how to score points. The configuation of cards you get will give you a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT game.

So kingdom builder is like a 20 game in 1 box. It's a simple non convoluted euro games that could probably replace a dozen of other games in your closet. So if it's you style of game, buy Kingdom builder and discard the rest.

Kingdom Builder is some sort of proof that most euro games simply glue mechanics together without any good reason. Kingdom builder does the same, but include all other games in 1 game. So it's like it said "I found your design trick and managed to include all your game into mine"

Finally expansions simply increase the possibilities this game has to offer by now making it a 50 game in 1.

Wow, I was surprised by how good this game is (two player at least, I have not tried it with more).   Addicting, different, lots of strategy, and lots of re-playability!  (although I can't wait for the expansion!).  It does NOT need any variants, the one card offers enough strategy and enough confinement to give a very interesting game with just the right amount of decisions, any more and it would be too easy to get perfect scores and your turns would be endless deciding where to go.  It has enough luck to make it fun, but enough strategy that the better player wins almost all the time, or all the time if they're a lot better :) .  I feel I need to play it more to learn all of the tactics and strategy it has to offer.  It reminds me of carcassonne in some ways, with less luck, but the same type of fun non stressful interesting play and the end scoring feels similar.  I think it might have about as much luck as Dominion. I love the artwork.  And I LOVE the fact that it's a simple game you can quickly learn the rules to, but has so much to offer in terms of strategy and fun, the perfect type of game! I am very impressed!!

RATING: 8
I really enjoy this planning game.  Some times randomness in combination with turn order (i.e. every one drawing the same card as you ahead of your turn) really pins you against the wall.  I believe that there could be one major improvement to minimize such severe cases of randomness.  The one variant which I suggest is that: every player starts each game with One "All-Terrain" Card.  It's a wild-card that can be used for any normal terrain card, and can be used instead of the normal card in player's hand.

A bad experience has soured this game for me. Through a combination of my starting position, impassible surrounding terrain and worthless card draws for my first few turns I was hampered in my ability to traverse the map and suffered from being hemmed in until much later in the game. It was a setback which I was unable to overcome. Perhaps it was just bad luck, but it ruined the game for me.

ios Have to give it a 9 even after I decided not to rate a game before playing the hard copy. The entire game revolves around the word "adjacent", and it's just so elegant and sometimes brilliant under such an unassuming constraint. Not to mention the endless variants. I understand people have different tastes in games as well as anything else. But no matter how hard I try, I just can't stand those who condemn games like this and Carcassonne for the sole reason that they are not able to see the nuance and depth beneath the simplicity.

Sounds like a meaningless exercise in repeating the same simple action every turn.  Flip a card, and play things where it says.  You have choices, but sometimes they're not that interesting, and sometimes you don't have choices at all because you've ended up in a corner.

Sounds like it has no balancing of different items; very one-dimensional game.  Maybe that's for other people; not me.

Problematic game.  There are too few decision points in this game.  The points in the game that you can actually care about the victory conditions are somewhere in the middle half of the game, leaving the beginning and ending very scripted (or forced, depending on your viewpoint).  The ability chits do give some flexibility, but not enough to viably work around the artificial constraints the game prides itself on.

Yes, the randomness can screw you, but that's true of lots of games, and probably less so here than Dominion.  An impressive production.

RATING: 6
You draw a card and attempt to put down three settlements on that terrain.  You are trying to satisfy various conditions in the game for scoring at the end.  There are other rules about gaining gold near castles and extra tiles for actions.  

The game is very abstract.  The name can mismanage expectations and you may think this is very different type of game.  However, it is light and family friendly.  It is a good game, but I tend like heavier games, and this is not one I would play repeatedly.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Rating based on one learning game in which I misunderstood an important rule regarding how to score victory points.  So, rating could change certainly upon further play.  But, that assumes there is further play.  Seems like Through the Desert with variable victory conditions and map layout.  Not terrible, but if I'm going to play a near abstract, I'd rather play Through the Desert.

Even from the one play, it seems clear that the decision-making is front loaded here.  After you study the randomly chosed victory conditions, you pretty much know where things are going for the rest of the game.  Dominion suffers from the same "puzzle more than game" issue.

Update:  Ok, now I've played it twice and both times did not understand the victory conditions correctly from the beginning.  This has not happened in any other game to my recollection.  I also feel like the game has the wrong amount of luck--determinative, but not enough iterations to even out within one playing.

Further Update:  Third time was the charm.  Finaly understood all the victory conditions from beginning to end of the game the same way.  Made for a much better experience.  Maybe still not a favorite, but a decent game I'll play with any group not subject to AP.

And yet another Update:  Well, actually, perhaps fifth time was the charm.  Had never played that you could take more than one of the same bonus action marker.  Apparently, still had never played by the rules.  This is the simplest game that I never play correctly.

I came into it expecting an overly simplistic offering and it kind of is. You don't often get any real decisions to make but you do have some options if you manage to gather some of the extra action tiles scattered around. Its saving grace is the variable scoring from game to game.  Without that element it would be a one and done deal.

Designed by Dominion creator and published by Queens Games.
Seems like a great combination.

Very quickly played.
Great amazon ratings as a non-gamers game.

Downside: Mediocre board art. Cards, however, look wonderful.


Vasel's review is sobering. The game seems highly overrated and just 'okay.' It seems that Through the Desert accomplishes the goal of KB more effectively.

On the other hand,  it is a top 300 game and #37 on the family Board game ranking. 
This review AND comments are compelling: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/917327/after-many-plays-with-family-introduced-to-game-gr

Note: the pros are also the cons. The restrictiveness in playing choices makes for little to none AP time. Plus the lightness lends itself well to newcomers and couple plays. Plus younger kids can easily jump aboard. I am personally a little mixed on whether to get this highly rated game.

THEREFORE it might be worth having I'd the price is right. But seems difficult to justify at the current price of $37.

It's an OK game with some OK ideas, but it's hard to care very much about the outcome... somehow the decisions and their pay-offs don't feel satisfying. The downtime with slow players is really tedious because the game is so thin there is almost nothing to occupy your mind with - the random terrain draw means you already more or less know what you will have to do on your turn, with little room for creativity.

A strange beast... True, the apparent randomness can be countered with clever play, but beginners are usually lost (and hard to persuade to give the game another chance). That it should need expansions in order to truly shine is also something I dislike. The modular board is great, though.

I somewhat regret mixing the expansions to this in with the base game, because although they don't hurt the game (nor increase its complexity) they do make for a longer set-up time in terms of sorting out the bits. I regret this, because I'm time poor, and the set-up time is the reason I often skip this game in favour of others, which is a shame because Kingdom Builder is a really good game.

I love that the game has simple enough rules that it's easy to pick up and play. I love that turns are short, and that you can plan your turn in advance. I love that the different special abilities and different scoring conditions aren't complicated, but make for highly varied play from game to game.

First impressions after only one somewhat rushed learning match.  I have mixed feelings about this game, but would like to try it again.  I like the simplicity and elegance of the rules, the short playlength, the spatial aspect, the player interaction on the board, the replayability.  What I don't like is the feeling that luck of the draw limits and directs what a player can do.  In other words, I am afraid that the game limits and controls too much of the player's freedom.  I need to see with repeated plays whether player's skill can offset this strong element of luck and give back some of that freedom.

RATING: 9.5
Simple and elegant game with endless replay value. The board is different each game but also the scoring mechanisms (3 out of 10 cards) vary from game to game. Each board have locations that give players abilities to bend the rules.

During your turn you have to play your only card and build 3 buildings on the terrain your card represents. You have to build adjacent to your previous buildings if possible and this is the key to victory: how you place your buildings opens and closes future paths on the game board.

There more I play this, the more I love it. Best with 4, but works well with 2 and 3 players (and 5 with the first expansion).

Brilliant game. Simple rules, randomness. Randomness drives game play but tons of tactical decisions that come from managing and minimizing the impact of the randomness.
Nice quality bits. Lots of variability. More of a quiet thinking game than a social event.
Includes red settlement pieces for a 5th player that came with my KB Big Box KS edition.

Another light game by Donald X.  The game plays more difficult then you would assume because of the rules for building settlements adjacent.  Both games I've played have been close.  I'm sure it will play much differently with more than two but we've enjoyed it so far.

Edit: 11/16/12
This keeps getting more and more plays with my family and my sister liked it so much she bought her own copy.  I increased my rating from 8 to 9 based on how much we all enjoy playing it.  Recently added the Nomads expansion...mostly for the 5th player.

RATING: 7
In this game I miss a theme. Not that every game needs a theme spread out widely, but when you call a game "Kingdom Builder", I expect a theme.

The game is too expensive for what it is.

A fast playing rather simple game of area control and intelligent placement of your "houses" on the board, in respect to your assignments and ways to score points. 

The game (except for the box) is not visually appealing.

Despite all that, once I'm playing it, I enjoy it. And the scoring cards make every play different

Minus: 2 - 4 - 7

Good gateway game.  30-45 minute run time even on first play through.  There is plenty of luck involved, but the game is short.  So, I forgive it for that.  Easy objectives.  Bland, sure, but it has a simplistic charm.

RATING: 8
I was hoping for an occasion to give this a try without purchasing it. On the one hand, the rules intrigued me a lot, but on the other hand, there were quite a lot of disparaging remarks about the simplicity of the game due to the curtailed options during your turn.

After a couple of plays, I now know that I should have trusted my instincts and just purchased the bundle at Essen’12, because this one’s not only fast and addictive, it is also definitely a game of skill. Furthermore, the straightforward turns where you just play your one card occur once or maybe twice at the start of the game, and then the options due to special actions branch out immensely. And then, the game is over, and if you’re like me, you immediately want another go.

This will certainly be one of the very few games I’ll buy in 2013, the only open question is whether I can hold back on the expansions.

RATING: 8.5
For something that's rated only a smidge over 2.0 in weight on BGG, it sure can burn my brain.  I've played 2 & 4 player games so far (35+ plays), but most games have just been my husband and I.  It's been interesting to see how we've changed our play and become much more thoughtful players as we've gained more experience in Kingdom Builder.  At first, I felt like 4 player was going to be best and 2 player felt like we were too isolated from each other.  Now, 4 player is definitely great, but we're much more in each other's face (when needed) in 2 player.  

At the start of the game, you have to take a second to consider how the locations, terrain, and point cards affect/play off each other - and how can you exploit all of that.  From that point forward, each turn will be a small puzzle - maximizing your placement for future turns while also balancing your chance to maximize your points.  

Definitely has a learning curve.  May come off a bit basic at first.  Most people aren't going to see the possibilities in their first few games and will likely be trounced by more experienced players.

Straightforward game play, plays quickly, and has quite a bit to consider each game.  I think I'm in love!

Another game from Donald (Dominion) with a lot of variability. Found this one a little boring, my girlfriend liked it though. There isn't really that much to do/to think and you only have one card in your hand which tells you where you have to put your houses. Therefore this makes for a good family game I guess. Easy to explain, flows pretty quick, not too much to think about.

RATING: 8.5
Fun little game!  A few plays so far and eager to play more.  Pretty light and casual, but interesting.  Fun to try to find your optimal move based on your current options.

UPDATE: Ok, I really enjoy this game, but I have to be honest.  It really feels like they intentionally "split" the game up so they could release an expansion later.  I have no doubt that this is how it went down.  Really could use some more Locations (aka extra abilities) and builder (scoring) cards.  It's hard not to feel a bit "cheated" when you know they could have just released more content at once.  Oh well, people (game designers and publishers) have to make a living I suppose - and they'll make decisions based on $. I do enjoy it, like I said. But it feels like vanilla Carcassone or vanilla Alhambra - good games, but games that really NEED their expansions to keep interest for very long.  I will likely be getting the expansion - I'll just grumble a bit when I have to pay for it.

4-26-14-Just a note to add that we play with all expansions in the mix from the time we received them.  There are a couple of things we leave out of Nomads; Miles does not like the tile that allows you to remove an opponent's settlement and also does not like the stones.  We love the way the expansions have kept the game fresh even after so many plays.  I would never choose to play without at least the Nomads exp.

7-29-12-To illustrate how much my husband (the non-gamer!) loves this game: he asked me today to order another copy because he's afraid we will wear out our current copy and then it will be out of print!  The only thing bad about this game is that I fear we will never get to play some of our other games that are still sitting in shrink!

3-8-12-We have played 41 games so far, in 3 weeks--we're obsessed!  Miles and I like to play 2p tournaments, best out of 3.  The more we play, the more we find there is to this one.  Sometimes you draw the objectives or the action tiles and you think, "we just had those in the last game!" but we've found that games are radically different from just one rotated player board or 1 card or tile.  We've also found that games are no longer 2p solitaire!  We are quite aggressive in our play and cut each other off when it suits us.  

2-23-12-We've found the games goes on too long (for us) if there are more than 2 special action tiles (of the 4 used for each game) which require players to move pieces from the board rather than from their supply. 2p games go about 15-20 min. and 3p not much more; maybe 5 min.   

I find it easier to get a truly random setup by shuffling the special action tiles face down on the table and picking 4, then finding the corresponding game board sections, shuffle them on the table and put them together randomly without rotating them again after the shuffle is done.

Sometimes, depending on the objective cards drawn, this game plays as multiplayer solitaire and other times we very much get in each other's way, cutting each other off from large areas of the board.  That even happens in 2p games!  I like both ways AND I find it lots of fun seeing what kind of game is going to result from each random setup.    

2-17-12-Right now I am obsessed with this game so I am making the guys play with it as often as possible.  So far we have 7 plays, either 2 or 3p.  I'm getting the hang of it a little better and am able to be more competitive.  It's great fun and the guys like it, too.  

2-12-12-Only played a couple of times but we are liking it.  It's not quite easy as some people are making it out to be.  Each decision is quite important even though the rules are simple.  I like the way that different objectives are used for each game and also boards.  All the variety should make this a highly replayable game.  It also plays fast which is always a good thing at our house.  I do see that this might be more fun w/4 players since then you would get in each other's way more, influencing your decisions more directly.

I like this game and have not yet played it enough to get any of the expansions, but Kingdom Builder: Nomads I am starting to make eyes at you across the room. 

A great family game that you can play with all ages. Experienced gamers need to get past the fact that you get told what terrain you have to place houses on by card draw. Where and how you place is where the game is at. Initially I was frustrated with this but then like a Giant Himalayan Lily the game blossomed and welcomed me into its embrace and I found myself enjoying it and wanting to play more. I wonder if Nomads will be as welcoming.

A good family game and definitely a keeper for now. I hope to get the first expansion soon and if I don't like that it may eventually at some point in the future drift into the trade pile, but that day is a long way off.

The game mechanics are simple. But once a person grabs enough tiles of a particular type, that gives them options to get more end game bonus points. Then it's hard to catch up or block them.

This wasn't a big hit with my gaming group, but (as it turns out) this is an excellent solo game. Most of the actions are tactical, which makes it possible to play as 2 or 3 players by yourself!

'High' in my Trade list.

Nice, fast, easy abstract game where you place settlements on a map and earn points after you've placed them all according to 3 cards each game out of 10 total. Fully replayable, thanks to the 8 different map pieces (4 used each game), and -of course- the 10 cards.
With 30-40' duration can be played as a filler, but after the game ends, you will definitely want another one!

A wonderful game that is light enough (on par with TTR) to play with the family, but enough variance that you play the game a little different every time. The weight of your choices is great and can be heartbreaking at the same time. Love it.

RATING: 10
This is an excellent game, cleverly tuned and nicely variable, with short turns that are enjoyable to plan without triggering AP. It's got a puzzle quality to it, in a good way, and it lasts exactly as long as it should. It feels very polished, and it's relatively easy to teach (even to non-gamers).

I love the way it combines 3/10 random victory conditions, 4/8 random special abilities, 4/LOTS of terrain placements, and random card draws into a whole that doesn't feel random, isn't purely tactical (you need to start with a strategy, but adapt it), and which feels satisfying without being too heavy. I've never played anything quite like it.

Although it's not a game where I feel connected to the theme, without the theme it wouldn't be nearly as fun -- despite being quite abstract. It plays differently with two (more wide-open, and you can often accomplish more of your original plan) than with 3+, but it's fun with all player numbers I've tried it with.

---

October 2014: Bumped up from a 9 to a 10. This is one of my all-time favorite games, delivering a consistently fun, engaging experience at every player count and with new as well as more experienced gamers.

It's also one of the only games I love to expand. I generally ignore expansions, but with KB they add options and increase replayability and variety without adding rules overhead. That's the sweet spot for me.

Initially impressed with this. OK so in one respect it's a slightly bland stereotypical Euro.

Carcassonne currently fills that role for me, but this might actually be better.

Plays quickly. I like it with three best. With four the downtime can be a problem as the game progresses while people try to maximize their "token" usage.

There are not a lot of informed decisions to make. Some of the angst you feel during the game is really a luck of the draw given what cards you'll draw on subsequent turns. With only one card in your hand, you can easily get cornered/forced out of contention on just a few turns if you're lucky enough.

My wife will usually play it with me which is a plus. Sometimes we'll play the same boards and end game point cards multiple times in a row (with a region card shuffle of course) just to see how the game turns out with different cards. In many cases there can be a drastic swing in points just based on the cards available.

Well I would rather play Paris Connection ten out of ten times.  This game is fine but it's not useful for me.  Territory control game that kind of feels like the scoring phase of Fjords expanded into a whole game.  The strategy is more about reacting to the map and shedding cubes than the investments of Paris Connection so the comparison isn't entirely fair, but they occupy for me the same light euro niche.

I was concerned that this would be too dry for us, and while it definitely is, we enjoyed it right from the start and more and more with each play. You can really screw yourself up big-time with your first one or two moves, but after some plays you have learned your lesson, and won't let it happen again. Those of you looking for theme should stay way clear, but if you enjoy the puzzle of squeezing out that one last, measly VP with a clever combo action, this game will deliver that in spades. The kingdom cards start to feel samey very quick and some of the cards / board combinations are not as interesting as others. I'm guessing that somewhere down the road I will have to throw in an expansion to keep it fresh, but not until I find one for a reasonable price (read: less than I have paid for the base game).

RATING: 8
This is great for what it is.  I never expected a heavy euro, but it is definitely a great family game that fills a similar niche to Ticket to Ride.  Just like Dominion, the variable setup keeps the game fresh.  While luck plays a large role, strategic play is important to keep your options open.  With good play, you'll always have options...

Played a handful of games. On the surface, Kingdom Builder seems targeted at me with it's elegant rules and abstract gameplay. My first few plays left me lukewarm though, as the actual balance of the game is difficult to ascertain. This wouldn't be an issue, however the bonus scoring tiles coupled with the one card hand plus the turn order can all influence your ability to score highly with some of the scoring options and some of the scoring options are just better than others. However, it plays extremely fast which is amazing because it doesn't wear out it's welcome.

Player consensus was that this is a "super-filler" game, plays fast enough with interesting and deep gameplay but probably not going to be anyone's favorite.

09/08/12 Played a three-player game. I found Kingdom Builder to be a nice little filler that will serve our game group well to indoctrinate newbies to German games. So even though its rather simple it can still hold the interest of experienced gamers. And that's exactly what we needed. The only thing that surprised me was how short it was. 
05/07/13 Played a four-player game in 36 minutes. We used the Capital expansion. 
05/30/15 Played a three-player game in 45 minutes. We used the Capital expansion. 
I changed my rating from a "6" to a "5". The game now gives me more of an "eh" feeling. I will still play it, but I'd rather not see it more than once a year. Its "point salad" scoring has gotten stale.

RATING: 6
It's light and random and quite dependent on the luck of the draw (in one game, one of the players was unlucky enough to draw desert cards almost exclusively), but it's still quite nice for a filler with lots of replay ability. The question is: are there better fillers that I'd rather play? Yes, there are, but I'll play this if someone else suggests it. Other than that, I don't really care. Not one I'd ever suggest or would consider purchasing. I've played it enough that I won't ever miss it again, yet I wouldn't be averse if that's what other people want. Pretty much the definition of vanilla for me.

Not bad, for a family style game. It's a typical Euro cubepusher with a theme painted on an abstract game, and there are not so much decisions to make. Which can be good with casual gamers I guess.

I'd even consider buying this if I found it dead cheap for playing with newbies or kids, because it feels less bad than Ticket to Ride. At least it has more replayability thanks to the different cards and maps. I can see why it won the Spiel des Jahres award.

This is a great game because it plays quickly and the variable setup gives each play a slightly different feel.  There's not enough depth to warrant a longer game and if it weren't for the variety there wouldn't be much replayability.  This has been a really nice addition to our quick gaming sessions during lunch at the office and I'm very interested in picking up the expansions.  We've also started exploring variants where players draw multiple cards to choose from, instead of the normal 1 card per turn.

RATING: 6
UPDATE: Got in quite a few plays, good with 2, best with 3 I'd say (in respects to downtime in particular) - I downrated it a bit because it's getting a bit stale with the goal cards - expansion or replace I guess?

Mechanically simple, everything is held together by the one core rule - if possible, you must build adjacent to your existing buildings - and somewhat random (a card draw tells you where you can build). However, finding the best way to victory within these constraints is a very fun puzzle. I think I prefer a 3 or 4 player game, as these introduce some additional screwage you don't get with just 2, but either way it is a game that lets you feel clever.

I agree with another reviewer that the scoring cards are not made equal, some of them are "linear" in their scoring and these are to me a lot less interesting than the non-linear ones (Merchants, Farmers, Hermits etc etc). I typically find merchants, a linear card and one more non-linear score card to be the most interesting, and I'm very interested in getting the Crossroads expansion to have more score cards to explore.

I view this game as more a puzzle style game (less screwage) than say Carcassonne, but both of these share characteristics with the spatial element and the need to consider the probabilities - "What do I do if I need to build X now" and how to maximize the likelihood that your terrain (or tile in Carcassonne) is beneficial to you. However, the myriad of special powers you can gain during play means that you end up with a very wide range of potential "solutions".

While I prefer it more with 3 or 4 than 2 because of the screwage, I typically will only play it with 2, because with more players I will lean towards more interactive games which is not something this will ever be.

A great game!

One of those games that has very simple rules, but ends up involving complex strategies. The game is kept fresh by only using 4 of 8 possible boards to create the map each time (and only 4 of 8 possible bonus powers), as well as randomising what victory points will be awarded for at the end of the game (3 out of 10 possible cards are used each game).

Plays really well with any number of players (2-4, 5 with expansion)

I've only played this game with people who are slower at taking their turns, so maybe that downplays the excitement, but I feel like if I played it with people who take their turns as quickly as I do that it would just fall into the "filler" category (or at least brush up against that line).

[u]01/24/2013[/u]:  I really like this game.  Unfortunately, as with many in my collection, I don't really get to play it with opponents, and that's why my rating doesn't quite make it to the next level.  I tried it out with my daughters a couple of times, and one time with all four of us.  I think it's a fantastic family game that has enough strategy to keep gamers interested.  However, despite the expansive sounding name, it's really an abstract at heart.  The theme is fairly non-existent, and, I think, that's where my family loses interest.

I enjoy the simple gameplay and the shear amount of variety involved.  You use four of eight available board tiles, each with their own special ability available to players, and  three of the available ten end-scoring conditions.  Some complain that your are too limited in your choices of play as you only draw one card per turn and you must place your settlements in that specified area.  But if you use the special abilities and do your best to place those early settlements advantageously, concerns with limitations should be rare.

I also love the aesthetics of this game.  Colors and colors everywhere.  The boards are full of seven different types of terrain (5 or 6 of which you can build upon).  The settlements are Catan style little wooden houses.  With the board full of settlement and landscape, I think it's really great to behold.  The learning curve is low for the rules, but the strategy is deeper than it appears at first.

Fun game. Some are saying that this builds upon and replaces [thing=503][/thing] but I have to disagree. They're both route-builders but Kingdom Builder has much more luck. Having a hand of one card to work with sure can be frustrating but I think it also adds to the challenge (and I'm sure it helps speed up the game). The variable scoring targets are very cool. Has a major turn-order/first player advantage - it seems like more and more designers are neglecting turn-order considerations. With a 30-minute play-time I won't let it bother me too much.

RATING: 8
I was prepared to hate Kingdom Builder. In fact, I had lost any interest in even trying it after hearing all of the negative reviews. I was talked into it at a con and I was very pleasantly surprised. It was fun! I like it best at two and three players, as the competition for location tiles gets too tight at four and five. If an opponent manages to get three or four location tiles to your one, you're at a severe disadvantage.

Some reviewers have called this an overly restrictive Through the Desert. I like it better than TtD for that very reason. Maybe I'm just not smart enough, but I find myself paralyzed in TtD, at a loss as to where I should play with the whole board open to me. Blocks are pointed and aggressive. I'm fighting a four-front war and losing. KB on the other hand hands you a direction, a restriction forcing you into tactical maximization. Longer term strategies *do* exist, both in the collection and execution of the location tiles and in more general terms, though you have to wait for the opportunity to jump on them. I love that the scoring conditions are random and change each game. In fact every turn feels like a delicious chaos: one of many terrain cards, some of many location tiles, some of many scoring conditions, now go win! It's not TtD or Go. It's light and chaotic and *fun*.

Future plays have reinforced to me the strategy in placement in planning for the future. Blocking yourself off, completing regions, avoiding touching other terrain, lots of ways to help yourself. Everyone I've introduced this game to has responded positively.

Seemingly light strategic game of placing houses.  Depth can be found with being able to think of which options you will have in the future and how to best fulfill the three chosen goals.  This game would be ranked much lower if the options and randomization of victory conditions and map lay-out where not present.  The simple rules and design makes it very fast to learn, and fun for beginners.  

The more I play this game the more I am enjoying it.  The 'frustration' of having only one card is key to selecting where you are going to expand while the abilities give you ways to circumvent the luck of the draw.

Looks like the inventor of Dominion has gone from pure strategy (Dominion), to almost pure tactics here.  The game plays as a series of puzzles, and seems very prone to AP.

Great area majority game with lots of variety and varied strategy. I, by chance, discovered this around the same time I discovered Dominant Species. Granted DS is area majority with a heavy dose of worker placement and Kingdom Builder doesn't have as many actions you can do on a turn, but Kingdom Builder also doesn't seem overly complex and actually feels more strategic since Dominant Species turns into a chaotic luck-fest. I used to favor more overblown designs like DS, but as my board game tastes "evolve", I realize that more bells and whistles don't necessarily mean more fun. It's still new, so not sure if rating will stay a nine, but I haven't even explored all the locations and builder cards yet...

Basically an abstract game - easy rules and although it seems very simple at first sight there is more in it. In our games there was also never a runaway leader but players who now the game better, have better scores in general. I still haven't found the winning strategy... but the first moves are really important for your stakes.

RATING: 6
Clever, easy to explain, and easy to play, but very luck driven (especially in the last 2-3 turns, a right or wrong card draw can give you a huge point swing), and altogether not too fulfilling. Would be a good family game for kids, but not enough meat for serious gamers.

I wanted to like this game more than I actually did. It plays quite well and the different settlements and victory conditions should offer a different gaming experience. Instead it all felt a bit 'samey' and one player comment the game should be titled "Settlement Placer" rather than "Kingdom Builder" because that's pretty much all one does.

I was not alone in not being blown away by this one, in three games with a total of six different opponents no-one raved about the game at the end and no-one hated it. 

Would play again - the rules are very easy to pick up - but am unlike to purchase.


UPDATE

Have played a few more times and the game is beginning to grow on me.  Not a AAAA+ game but a reasonably enjoyable experience once you accept it for what it is (a semi-light abstract).

Surprisingly deep game despite the simple rules.  The variable victory conditions and boards/ special powers dramatically increase playability.

This is very simple game. You take a card and place three houses on land hexes that correspond to the card. Some extra actions can be aquired as the game progresses. Last round is triggered when one player places last of his houses. There are ten goal cards from which three are used in each game. These cards determine how you should build your colonies to score victory points. 

Although this is very simple to learn it isn't boring or too easy. There is a lot of variation. Game board is not fixed but consists of four parts which are chosen from eight different board pieces available in base game box. 

I like to play Kingdom Builder when I want to have a quick fix to euro strategy fever and don't have time or energy to play anything heavier.

Played this maybe 5 times now, mostly with expansion.  It's an average game in my opinion. Nothing that stands out that would make me want to own but then again nothing that would prevent me from playing if someone busted out at game night.  There are some simple assumptions built into game that result in a 'broken' experience if you don't consider them.  For example, if your first play connects with several terrains you could easily spend the remainder of the game in a feedback loop over which you have no control.  I have witnessed this occur and there is nothing that the player could have done to escape.  They easily could have skipped out on the next 2 hours without any impact to game.

That said, anybody that has played this game 3 or more times would likely avoid such a move.  My main reaction to the game really is just that I don't experience any emotions playing the game nor connections with other players.  There is a moderate amount of strategy to the game, but its questionable whether or not the reward is worth the effort.

Kingdom Builder is probably not unfamiliar to any Cultist [of the New] on BGG. It's swept a lot of gamers away with the promise of similar replayability [or at least similar "interplay variability"] as the designer's smash-hit Dominion [which I find even duller than Kingdom Builder]. It's a relatively straightforward "tile placement" / connection game akin to Through the Desert, but using terrain cards to determine where players are able to place their pieces as in Hacienda or Attika. The gimmick of the game, and source of promised replay value, is that each game will have a randomly chosen set of 3 [out of 10 so far] cards that determine what will score points in the game at hand. Most of these are straightforward and uninteresting: "Score points for your largest group of connected tiles", "Score points for tiles placed next to the _______ terrain", "Score points for connecting certain locations", etc.

One of the scoring cards, however, is quite remarkable and is very interesting: the Hermits. The Hermits card gives you 1 point for every separate group of connected tiles you have on the board. "Big deal", you say. Here's the big deal: The rule for playing new tiles is that you get dealt a terrain card and have to put new tiles only on that terrain and, additionally, adjacent if possible to your previously placed tiles. If your previous plays are touching the terrain you drew anywhere on the board, you are required to play there, obviously extending a group rather than making a new one. This interaction between the placement rules and the scoring objective of the Hermits card is exactly the kind of thing that can make a game interesting; it's non-linear [i.e. you don't just get points for doing what the game causes you to do anyway] and it's truly difficult to capitalize on.

Unfortunately, the Hermits card is the most interesting of the set, and really the only one that has this kind of counterintuitive / counterproductive tension at its core. I can't see ever wanting to play the game without this particular scoring card, which makes me wonder why the designer didn't just make up a bigger preset scoring system that rewards this kind of interesting gameplay tension. Hacienda's market scoring, for instance, rewards similar diversity in position on the board, but the game makes it relatively easy to break up your groups of tiles so there isn't this tension [tension in Hacienda arises elsewhere]. Such a system could easily have been wrapped into a more consistently interesting game rather than left as a quirk that only shows up in about 30% of games. I'm told the expansion has other interesting scoring cards, but again, they turn up randomly.

This is the same kind of complaint I have against Dominion... it's just not consistently interesting, and the basic game structure itself simply isn't compelling enough to make up for a "bad" setup. In fact, this is also the chief complaint I have against another famously "infinitely replayable" game, Cosmic Encounter. Games need structural interest to work, and I don't see Kingdom Builder reliably providing that. I'd rather just pull something off the shelf that I know already has interesting tensions and difficulties built right in by the designer. I guess one could just always pre-select Hermits as one of the 3 scoring cards, but that seems contrary to the purpose of the game and doesn't make a lot of sense. The game still would need at least one other tension-producing objective that both opposed the normal, linear flow of gameplay and the preset "most separate groups" goal of Hermits. This is work that designers, not players, are supposed to do.

My first play was okay -- I placed my settlements and activated bonus actions without much thought. After the first game, I felt the game was nothing special.

So I played it a 2nd time. Suddenly the strategic possibilities became clearer: which bonus tiles to activate, the order to activate them, whether to activate them before or after playing the terrain card, etc. It is a pretty simple game, but there's a little more depth than meets the eye.

Very quick game with sufficient depth for family play and a gamers filler. Many different victory conditions and boards should make a high replay value.
After more plays this game has just got better and better. It works as a family style game and also a gamers game. When playing with the "Hermits" card and the "Stable" ability the game moves into a reasonably deep strategy arena, and still completes in 45 minutes.
RECOMMENDED.

RATING: 8
A scoring maximisation game that utilises some visual/spatial skills from the designer of Dominion.

The game generates high re-playability by using a combination of terrain boards and the selection of 3 Scoring cards that set the objectives for the players.

Each turn the players must place settlement (3) on a terrain determined by the drawing of card. What influences the players placement of settlements are the placement rules, which state that players must place settlements adjacent to other settlements already in play if they are in or adjacent to the terrain just drawn. What players are trying to do is keep their placement options as open as possible. 

It's a good game but does feel quite abstracted, which may appeal to some more than others. There is luck to in the drawing of terrain cards but the luck is lessened by a player's placements and their use of powers bestowed by key locations on the boards.

I love this game. The main mechanism of placing three settlements every turn, adjacent when possible, is so simple, but of course, it leads to a lot of decisions that must be made. I like abstracts though, and I think the very abstract nature of this game, and the simplicity of its mechanisms, and its predictability is part of the appeal for me. I like the rhythm of it, especially. It's tense in its competitiveness but calm in its mechanics, and that's something that appeals heavily to me in a game. One other critical feature this game has is the randomized goals and player powers, so that despite the game's simplicity, it never plays exactly the same way twice.

I can see why some people do not like this game as much. The one drawback a lot of people mention is only being able to place on a single random terrain type every turn; I don't find that in general to be much of an issue, though. You can have some bad luck, of course, but limiting the terrain type does not limit your decisions that much since where your settlements go within a terrain type can still matter, and many decisions must be made about when and how to use the special abilities players can gain. The biggest problem this game has is that a bad starting location can utterly destroy a game. This is primarily a disadvantage the very first time one plays; after that, it doesn't usually come up, unless one chooses poorly. And, in fact, where to start one's settlements is part of the strategy.

For me the biggest drawback to this game (and is certainly not one that is unique to Kingdom Builder) is that you could in theory figure out everyone's score every turn and take that into account for planning - but that, of course, is time prohibitive. This, combined with some of the harder to predict or calculate scoring goals can lead to the final outcome of the game feeling too unpredictable. This is something that is mitigated to a degree by experience, but it is the biggest issue I have with the game.

This is a great game in the vein of "Settlers of Cataan". I think it is a little bit better because even when you have bad luck and get Desert tile 4 times in a row, you still get to play the game. In Cataan a bad start and bad rolls would mean you couldn't do anything.

Oh, and I love the infinite replayability. I wish some of the tiles were easier to understand.

Note: This is for the base version of the game.

Interesting strategic depth that is not obvious in the beginning. Fast gameplay, decent replayability due to a random map setup and varying victory point conditions. 

However: Bad luck on the first 1-2 draws kills your game. All you can really do at that point is wait for the next game to start. It's an interesting filler about managing randomness by counting cards and planning ahead. But easily forgettable after I haven't played it in a while.

In this enjoyable filler, players first choose four boards out of eight to construct a map. Each board will contain different terrain, and extra action chits. By placing a settlement next to a castle, one can earn an extra action for the whole game. You also choose three victory card conditions from the ten available, so each game will be different. Your turn consists of playing a terrain card, putting settlements on that terrain, an dusing your extra actions.

It's very quick, and it does have a good dose of luck, since you only draw one terrain card. I like it, it has a "let's play another game" to it, though it may wear thin after repeated playings. But it's fun so far.

Almost impossible to rate, given how variable one game can be from the next, but all in all this is a nice abstract game that usually is about making the best of the hand you've been dealt. Of course, you are only dealt one card, so making the best of it entails planning ahead so that any card that you receive will provide you with as many options as possible. The rules system is elegant enough that changing virtually all of them from game to game doesn't create a state of paralysis, which is something of a design achievement in itself.

[b]Artwork: 2/5[/b]: The review I had for this game last time stated that the board and cards look nice. I must've been drunk the last time I played this game because it looks like anus. The board is just an eye sore, though I will admit, one eye sore of a terrain looks very distinctive from the other eye sore terrains, so you'll be able to tell the difference between two different terrains easily. The only reason this isn't a 1/5 is because the card art is fine.

[b]Strategy: 2/5[/b]: I won't pretend this game is equivalent to Candy Land, but boy it isn't far. Only drawing one card heavily limits your strategy no matter what. I understand that there is some strategy, but that strategy really isn't that plentiful if the card you pull determines the action you can do, and most of the time those actions are pretty obvious. How... boring.

[b]Replay value 5/5[/b]: I'll admit, if you like the game, then the replay value is awesome. The modular board on top of the different objectives every time you play, very nice for people that enjoy the game. Not so nice for me, but I have to give credit where credit is due.

RATING: 8
5 different playable regions, two unplayable, draw a card, and play your pieces on the region always playing adjacent to your previously played pieces...if it is not possible to play next to a previous piece, you can get creative.  There are three different randomly chosen ways to score points in each game.  The map pieces and ways to score are all random and change every game, allowing for much variation from game to game.

This is a very quick strategic game with variation.  I am enjoying this one.

This was a good game, but not a great game. I can see how you can be really cornered early, leaving you zero choices. For that reason, I wasn't a huge fan, but I would play it again for sure.

RATING: 6
Medium-paced, medium-length game with an abstract flavor that features a lot of unique strategy and replayability. Seems like it would play well as a gateway and with a group of serious gamers.
----
Liked it less on a second play; this could have been because the combination of in-game goals was a weird one. However, it seems like it's possible to acquire insurmountable combos in the very beginning, and then the rest of the game is spent playing out the inevitable. The way to score points often seems like a matter of exploiting loopholes, dotting Is, crossing Ts. Not sure I'd play this again, because it's laborious, but also to preserve my undefeated record.

RATING: 4.5
My art partner asks why I haven't tried designing an abstract game.  I hold this game up as an example of an abstract gone wrong.  A modular board and modular win conditions?  Yes, it gives you replayability, but it reduces the exercise to a multi-player optimization puzzle... and frankly, if there's one thing the board game community DOESN'T NEED is yet another multi-player optimization puzzle.

I'll play it if it's your thing, but don't expect me to ask for it, which is deeply ironic given Don X.'s intention to create a game with infinite replayability.  You want an abstract with nearly infinite replayability?  Play Go.  A board, a lot of rocks, and about three rules.  And yet it stands the test of time.  I'm already bored with Kingdom Builder.

I actually avoided this game for a long time because it just didn't look very interesting and the design was kind of blah.

But I received it as a gift and was really surprised how much I really like it. It actually hits a sweet spot for games. Easy to teach, easy to st up, but has just enough strategic and tactical depth to make me think. Plus, with 2 players a game is pretty fast.

After what I saw in some reviews, I was very afraid buying this game could turn to be a bad decision. They said the game was too simplistic, etc.

Definitely, it's a gateway game, but you have a nice deal of options/decisions/ways to play at your disposal. 

The game flows very fast, because you can think your turn in advance (the gameboard suffers few changes between your turns). We played our first 4 games (3 players) in less than 2 hours, that's < 30 minutes per game, 15 less than advertised. There are fillers that take more time! :D

I definitely liked what the game offers.

My biggest complaint is the lack of diversity with locations and characters (especially with characters, because it could have been easily solved). I guess it would be solved with expansions but so far, Nomads has not gone too far in this regard...

We played just 4 games, but we had many locations repeated and some characters too. There was enough diversity to make games different, but I see there is a limit there that will be reached when I play more games.

First impression (4 players): One of those games where you first impression might be wrong because of how game goes but I was let down quite a bit. Maybe the map and scoring options were not so interesting in my game but it felt really mediocre. I can see there might be more fun in manipulation of where you can build early but at midgame even that more or less is gone and can really hurt you if you draw "bad" cards more than opponents.

The box is too big for a 15 minute game (quite the right size after adding the expansions, though) but the game is enjoyable even if it often comes down to just calculating the point value of a move.

Feels really crappy on the first try, but gets exponentially more interesting with repeated playings.

Desperately in need of an expansion consisting entirely of basic scoring cards.

Slightly disappointing components: Non-standard box size mainly filled with air, and comes with four huge bags which are too small for the boards but useless for anything else. Cheap cardboard, and the printing quality is different in the expansions.

Questo nuovo gioco di Vaccarino mi ricorda un vecchio gioco italiano: Terra nova di Gaetano Evola 
Rosanna Leocata. Stessa grafica, meccanica simile e piazzamenti. La partitcolarità di Kingdom, come per i più noti giochi di Vaccarino, è la possibilità di variare le partite a seconda delle combinazioni del setup iniziale. Un family game semplice e abbastanza veloce che però non mi regala divertimento. Bocciato.

Really cute - much better than I had any right to hope looking at the sterile board and premise. DXV is capable of creating great games from very simple rules, and when you think of the tweaks and fiddles shoved into games of his peers, it's an admirable achievement.

The glory of Kingdom Builder is in the variable victory point conditions, which make no two games even vaguely alike.

RATING: 6
I have come around to the (unintuitive and probably unpopular) opinion that the "replayability" in the game is largely illusory. The scoring cards dominate your objectives, but the single terrain card restricts your options so much that there is essentially no strategy, just tactical reaction. The 70 combinations of tokens devolve down to 2: ones that allow an extra placement, and ones that allow movement. yea, terrain will be random, and your cards will be random, but your algorithm for decision-making is pretty much only going to vary based on the scoring cards, and there is usually a dominant card that is going to be the most powerful (e.g., knights or merchant) that gains most of your attention.

I consider this almost more puzzle than game, and with 2 
players it has the advantage of being relatively quick.
-----
In Oregon at least - and I'm not really a huge fan of that game, either - you usually have multiple locations you can play to, often with ambiguous returns. You also have to choose whether to use your extra turn or joker, which can be a tough choice when the station and warehouse are not on the board. In KB, you're going to use your powers every turn, and there's usually an obviously best option.

I think there might be more 'strategy' in KB than Oregon, but like Dominion, it all pretty much occurs at the beginning of the game as you analyze the interaction of the scoring cards and board powers. The rest of the game is execution. Like Dominion, the in-game decisions are pretty trivial.

I was a little bit underwhelmed by it and maybe I'm also underrating it a little bit. It's actually not too long and it is interesting enough to try it out, but it is also quiet abstract and your more limited in the choices than I expected. The variability that comes in with the different types of scoring from game to game is just a little too similar for me to really offer a big replayability. I would maybe play it when asked, but it didn't really click for me.

Kingdom Builder is a reasonably simple Area Majority-style game, with similarities to Through the Desert or Hacienda. Unlike those games, it is perfectly playable for people who are colourblind. The board is modular, constructed of heavy stock and the rules are clear.

Kingdom Builder is light-medium complexity, and needs a little thought each turn. I found it easy to teach to complete newcomers: they enjoyed the game enough to play again, so I suppose it counts as a "Gateway" game too.

Play is pretty brisk. There are plenty of opportunities to block the other players, and enough variability in the boards and VP objectives to keep it fresh. [-]But it is not going to repay many repetitions in a short period of time; it is a light game and would begin to feel same-y fairly quickly. As a member of a regular rotation it is fine.[/-]

EDIT: That last bit was (a) wrong, (b) pretentious. KB is still getting played 2-3 times a month over a year after I first bought it. Top ten game with the expansion.

An excellent game that's a good medium weight and it's fun to play. The modular boards really make every game totally different because the terrain areas are so varied. Each game you begin with three objectives that can give you potential points (for example, the person that has built the most near water, etc.

Several have complained that they were disappointed that this game wasn't at all like Dominion (Donald X. Vacharino's first hit). I don't think it was supposed to be, as I also don't think Monster Factory was supposed to be either. I really appreciate all three of these games for what they are and how they fit my game play moods. And all three are fun, unique and clever in their own right.

Like many comments, this didn't really click for me the first few times I played this.  Years passed before we received it as a gift.  I read up on the ways to think about it to make it more strategic, and I now really enjoy playing the puzzle trying to get appropriate power tiles and leverage them to meet the gold scoring conditions.  Very bad card draws can occasionally make the game less fun, but I can usually enjoy maximizing my score with what I drew.

We enjoy the expansions, and most of our plays now include randomized elements from Nomads and Crossroads, except for the Nomads board section with Caravans, which we feel is broken.

Excellent engine building game, similar to Through the Desert but where some of the locations give you special powers.

I quite like it, there's a nice mix of short term and long term tradeoffs. For example you could grab a power now, but that will put you next to a new terrain type or two, which could stop you being able to jump right across the board which might be important for certain scoring cards. But if you ignore a special power token, someone might cut you off.

Perhaps there is an optimal way to play each position, but the lookahead is so fuzzy due to cards and not knowing what your opponents will be able to do that it's hard to know what is really best.

The only major thing I dislike about the game is the card draw can screw you. You don't get many turns (40 houses ~ 10 turns?), so it's quite easy to get 3 or 4 copies of the same card and only 1 of another type. I'm not sure what I'd do about it - maybe a once per game wild card, or a Ticket to Ride style draught (hand size 1), or the option to dump your current card for a mystery card at some penalty (-VPs? fewer houses?) I think giving complete freedom is going too far, except [i]maybe [/i]on the first turn.

Nothing much to see here.  It is a simple game that plays quickly, but that is about where the fun ends for me.  Having only a single card you must play can really screw you over.  I felt like after the second turn I no longer was able to make any choices, my turns were all obvious.  Would be willing to give it another shot.

Edit: Was a little better on the second play, though we house ruled that your hand consists of two cards instead of one.  It opened up the set of available moves dramatically and made the game a lot more interesting.

RATING: 8
A positive vibe placement game. You're aiming to get your settlements out to score points, and the neat touch here is that the scoring rules are going to be different each game (3 of the 10 possible rules are randomly chosen pre-game, with no doubt more rules to come via expansions). Different games might want to build lots of small settlements, others big ones, connecting up locations, on different horizontal lines, etc, so there's a slightly different feel for each game which hopefully is enough to satisfy cravings for variety. The building restrictions (must always place adjacent to your existing settlements if you can) and the limit of 1 terrain card per turn (which may mean you can't place adjacent so you can go anywhere) both makes turns quick and also pushes you to place carefully and smartly. Getting connected to the extra action markers early allows you the opportunity to do clever moves, be it separating, moving or adding settlements before or after your auto 3 settlement placement on your terrain card to help you get where the scoring rules want you to get. It's easy to teach so the family can play, and there's enough there for gamers. Good light Euro fillery meat.

What I like:
- 4p with 2 first-timers only took 35 minutes
- It is a clever design
- Good variability of setup

What I don't like:
- I don't generally like "placement" games
- The card draws can be really frustrating
- The blocking can be really annoying
- Some special abilities are WAY stronger than others, so first-timers can suffer

Like Through the Desert, it is a placement game with blocking. Just not at all my thing. I would put the complexity around 2.2, so with some depth I would put the weight around 2.5, substantially higher than BGG voters.

The only reason I would be willing to play it again is because it can be over so quickly.

Gift from Dennis Meschke on the 21st of April 2013. Not yet played but definitely a must play.

First play and an instant hit. Great game with simple rules yet the special power tiles add lots of strategic possibilities. A great game with a ton of replayability due to the many different possible combinations of landscapes and objective cards.

A well deserved game of the year 2012. Will definitely get me an expansion.

Its a "Find the best move"-abstractish game. Which is a genre I like, so I like this one. It is very prone to AP though. And some combinations of special actions will result in a clearly longer game than others (if its mostly "move cube" instead of "put new cube on board"), since less cubes are used and moving requires more thought.
Still, good game, at least with more than 2.

My favorite abstract game! Like Medina, it has just a little bit of theme to it.  I always enjoy that.  It's a lot of fun trying to position your settlements in the best places to earn gold (score points) and to maximize the use of the next card your draw.  And you must also be strategic about which bonus action tokens you acquire, to help build the best strategy for that particular game.  You'll never play the same game twice.

Great gateway game. My wife absolutely loves it. Any game which my wife requests for subsequent plays deserves a 10!

Simple enough to learn in 5 minutes, has enough depth for regular gamers and the variations between each game increases re-playability. A very good balance struck between the 3 (simplicity, depth, re-playability).

Essentially a tile laying game with elements of route building and area control thrown in.  This is a game I liked at first, then grew quickly tired of due to the influx of new games.  When I returned to it more than a year later, I realized what a genius design it really is.  The mechanics are so simple and at first seem limiting (single card draw).  But this game, more than any other I have played, encourages and rewards players who are able to creatively shirk the restrictions and expand in an efficient way that best abuses the common goals that are available.  There is also a lot of decision making that goes into what abilities to collect and how best to use those abilities.

It is a great game. With the different boards, with the different layouts; the choice of different targets to aim for which changes each game and the different types of bonus tile, it means that each game is different. I've used different there a lot, but that's what this game gives you variety and replayability (is that a word).

Despite the completely different game mechanics, the variable setup factor makes you treat this game a lot like Dominion: you stare a while at what's available this game, come up with a strategy, and the rest of the game is just execution.  Here, the physical board provides more way to interact.  However, the bulk of the fun of the game comes of trying to puzzle out how you want to approach the special rules the game is presenting you.

Have only played a few games but it is very fun.  There are enough map/victory card combinations to make each play very different than the last.  First time reading rules is a little long, but once you have played, it is easy to teach to others.

I really wanted to like this, but really felt limited by the card draw.  There are of course ways to mitigate this to some extent, but really there aren't enough options to ensure you don't get screwed.  I know the probability of drawing the same landscape over & over is low, but it happened in every game I played.  Some part of me wants to explore this more, but the sane part of me says let it go...

Comment: The first couple plays of it were pretty "ok", but after seeing how some of the tokens work together and how only having a single card still gives you a significant amount of choices, I've grown to enjoy it more and more with each successive play. There is so much to explore and each expansion just keeps bumping it up a notch for me. It's so simple and yet there is so much hidden depth to it. Lovely components and quick gameplay makes this a homerun.

Extras: FFG euro sleeves. Condensed down into both expansion boxes.

A great family game, where you build settlements on the terrain indicated, use special abilities and score points in the end. Can be easily taught, has simple rules and everyone stays in the game until the end, as scoring is only calculated at end-game.

First play was okay, but felt a bit too light to want to buy it. Second game I drew exactly the same 2 cards for every draw except 2 in the game, and made precisely 2 decisions in the entire 45 minutes. Third game I lost out on bonus chits due to turn order.

Some games I know I like more than they deserve, and some games I don't like but I can see the quality of their design, but I just can't see why anyone plays this ahead of dozens of other light Euros.

I'm torn on this game.  It's a quick, descent gateway game.  It has a lot of variability with the map layout, special powers, and three different scoring methods.  Many games are not the same.  I really liked these aspects.

However, I also really don't care for how the luck/settlement placement by card draw is implemented into the game.  It makes your first placement critical, thus very unforgiving to new players.  I've seen too many games come down to a mere card draw deciding the winner.  Granted, with more plays, use of the special abilities (placing a fourth settlement or moving one) helps with this issue, however again, one has to obtain the ability.  I've also noticed the players who get more abilities tend to win the game.

I prefer games like this that have extremely simple rules and yet seem to have multiple layers of understanding how to play well. Set up is quick. 

Each game only has three scoring rules and four special powers, but the game box includes 10 variations on scoring rules and 8 variations on special powers, so each game has a different objective. You have to solve a new problem each time, but the problems are simple and the tools to solve the problem are simple.

Really well done. It is never going to be your favorite game, but there is a lot to like with this one.

After the many Tom Vasel warnings, I quite like this. I understand why he doesn't, but I don't get the hate. It is a PRETTY abstract, where you can pickup player powers. It is very light (few rules) and accessible (randomness).. So if you're looking for a gateway like Carcassonne or the like, this is one to look into. It really isn't really interactive, so there's that aswell...

This game is so misunderstood, it feels relaxed, but it is not, but it really is... (Actually, when they played it on tabletop, Wheaton said he wanted to play this because it is a relaxing game) but maybe that's why it bombed with everyone I played it with. Too passive of a game?

Thing is, each piece placement is so important, but it doesn´t feel like it.

Anyways, I sold it cause no one wanted to play. But I have the App and play it often. Quick game to play on a tablet.

I got to play this at my local meetup. The game feels lighter than Dominion or the lack of "combos" that you can pull out from Dominion. But it is not a fair comparison because the games are different from another. This is a great game for non-gamers. After a 15min explanation of the rules the game hit the table and we started to play. Even though the veteran of the game won at the end, it was pretty close until the last kingdom card calculation. I see some depth in it but somewhere along the "I will play if someone brings it out" type of game.

---- Update ----
Got this with The Capitol Promo in a MT.

---- Update ----
Got to play two 2-player games with my fiancee and this is a fun light game that requires some thinking but not brain burning. Will see the chance to bring this out quite a lot since it is light and easy to play.

---- Update ----
This game is quite fun as it provides good enough depth to the game than it initially presents itself. I get why people said this game is an acquired taste now. Rating goes from 7 -> 8.

---- Update ----
Rating goes down again from 8 to 7 when some boring and contradicting scoring cards were randomly chosen in my 2-player game with fiancee. What a shame.

Some combinations of board setup and ancillary powers work well. At its best, it clips along like a game of base-set Dominion. But some board setups and ancillary powers combinations lead to very odd results with slow, lumpy play and runaway leader syndrome.

Perhaps some play testing of scenarios and board setups would help? But just saying that the modular board and varied setups leads to "re-playability" is B.S. What varied setup really leads to is a mishmash of game experiences that range from good to bad.

But with certain setups, it's a very good gateway game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
An easy-to-explain "area control" game of maximizing one's efficiency. Players place pieces to claim territory in ways that score the most points for that game, and try to claim "bonus action" chips that make adding those pieces more dynamic.

Certain strategies are dictated early (due in part to turn order), and sometimes, players repeatedly draw placement cards that they don't prefer (and, at times, can't use to advantage), so it's not chess or go (though it is, for all practical purposes, just as abstract as either).  There will be the occasional game where one player, due to a bad initial placement/tile disadvantage/scoring method combo, won't have much of a chance.

But it plays quickly, the leader is not 100% obvious (unless you repeatedly count up things before your turn), so the end-scoring usually contains a surprise or two, and it's tough to focus on all three variable scoring methods each turn, so most times you have a placement option even if it's not optimal for your primary strategy. For 45 minutes of game, it's pretty engaging, and with the bonus actions, there are some clever combos that can be put together.

Ugh, this game is so weak.

Very, very few meaningful decisions. The game basically plays itself, except for the rare few times you'll be able to make a decision that ~might~ seed itself into a move that's worth a damn 6 cardflips later.

Or it might be too late by then.

There's some "draw 2" variants that help alleviate this problem, but why do we have to houserule this game?

Grossly overhyped, for certain.

RATING: 8
A bit of a strange game, where placing is limited by which card you draw, but the more you limit yourself the more freedom you have. So strategically it's about finding a balance between maximizing your freedom and maximizing your score, while tactically you really don't have that many options. There's a lot of apparent player interaction, but usually there's not that much choice involved: you block others if you can and if it doesn't cost you too much, but it's not something you plan for. It lacks a strong core or some sort of 'story' that binds it all together, but that's because the focus is on variation from game to game, not variation within a game or robustness. Very game-y. Subtle deliberations rather than multiple-step plans.

Not enough control or narrative to play this once a year as the big game for the evening. But if you want some sort of 'bigger filler' that you can play often, that allows you to make a plan and then solve several smallish puzzles on how to best implement it, Kingdom Builder is very solid. 

It's pretty much perfect for what it is, which bumps my rating to an 8, but I do have to say that I'm happy owning big strategy games and small fillers, and I don't particularly need a game that's somewhere in between, not intuitive enough for an abstract and not narrative enough for a thematic boardgame. It's in a weird spot where I wouldn't mind playing this every week, but it also wouldn't bother me if I'd never play it again.

One more thing: I have a feeling it takes a couple of plays to get used to the fact that you only draw one card and you have to build on that terrain, and sometimes you will draw three deserts in a row or something, and perhaps you find out you had not considered that with your initial placement, and now you're frustrated. So introduce a houserule, like giving everyone an extra secret card that they can use once per game, and then drop that rule after everyone has one or two games under their belt. Normally you'd play a few games before you start thinking about houserules, but here the reverse might work well.

I'm not sure what's up with the folks that say that this is a luckfest and that there are no meaningful decisions...they must have played a different game.

Own Android App

Post app purchase: I can see how the game isn't for everyone but I've definitely enjoyed playing it and think its a game everyone should experience. It's a puzzly area control game whose variability (boards, scoring cards, tile powers) keeps you reinventing your strategy and tactics every time you play. While it features a bit more luck/randomness than I like (occasionally you'll have a game where your every move is thwarted by the card draws), it's just about right to keep an experienced player on their toes and give a novice player a fighting chance. The blocking area control can get a little tense some games, but again it's just about the right mix that passive aggressive gamers thrive on. It does feel a little abstract and soulless (i.e Carcassonne seems more satisfying by completing features on the map, rather than making lines of identical buildings) but is great as a game that warms up the brain yet doesn't burn it out for the evening.

Those who have been arguing that having only one card in hand makes it too luck-dependent are missing the point I think. With more than one card, there would be way too many options and you might as well just do away with the cards altogether. They're there as a constraint - if you play well, you should have sufficient options most of the time anyway. I'm really enjoying how the goal cards in play dramatically change the morphology of the board. It'd be kind of fun to photograph some endgame layouts and try to guess which goals were in play.

Not much to say here, was a snooze fest. Kind of like Carcassone but with more of a pain during setup and scoring and further reducing interaction between players . For area control games I could name over 20 games I'd rather play over this. The common quest cards are nice and dictate a different play style for each game, but I feel the game is missing one or two extra elements, and I'm not sure what those are but they are definitely missing. Could be fun for a strategic group, however, because despite the limited actions during the game, there is definitely room to strategize, form plans, and think well ahead.

You may not be building a kingdom, but you are certainly building routes. It is pretty abstract and very tactical. The card draw limits you to one terrain, which the placement rules forces you to fill up adjacent spaces. You are pretty much stuck in the part of the board where your houses exist. Unless you can touch the bonus locations to get some allowances to place additional houses or move houses already placed on the board. Having a few are very desirable. 

Change to play is provided by differing victory conditions and a gemorphic board. 

I can see why a lot of people don't like the game and think it is too random. The card draw is limiting, but the game is all about making the best of what you get and aim to provide as much flexibility as possible. While not a favorite of mine, I can see playing it occasionally.

After two plays, this fell super-flat. It felt like you won or lost based on if you drew the terrain card you needed or not. I admit that we are terrible at this game, so it probably gets better once you learn how to set yourself up for good outcomes no matter the future draw, but we are definitely not at that point. For a game that bills itself as beginner-friendly, that's a problem. Game 1, my opponent got kept having to play in one sector the whole game and I cleaned house with Lords. Game 2, my opponent got stuck in a giant desert and kept having to build in desert almost every time, so he went nowhere and I won easily again. Huge miss for us.

I think this is simple a meh game. I like the variable scoring cards that cause you to aim to do different things....but I don't like the mechanic that dictates what terrain you have to play in. You can't really plan ahead, and many times you can't even change much on your turn. Lots of times the game feels like it was won by the person that got the best terrain card draws.

I'm firmly in the camp who thinks there's way more game here than one might initially perceive (probably obvious since I've played it 48 times at the time of this writing), and I believe I've figured out what I like the most about it: it makes you earn your choices. 

There's a fairly standard expectation in gaming now where a game must shower you with choices to be good, or to stand out. The choices have to be difficult (or at least, [i]appear[/i] to be difficult) and a lot of enjoyment comes from valuing your options each turn, then choosing one of them. Kingdom Builder doesn't do this, and I find that refreshing. Instead, it guarantees you one choice. If you want more, you have to do something about it. The size of your decision tree is entirely up to you…

…well, almost. Yeah, you can be screwed by the card draw, but that's pretty rare (this is my most played game; there may have been two or three games in there where a player was totally hosed by the card draw). I think because we can set up, play, and tear down a game of this in 17 minutes (yes, we timed it) it doesn't bother me. I've reached a point where this is a filler for a few of my regular opponents, and that's a great place to be. It's been a good "let's play again" game for a while as well--with my father and/or brother, we generally play 3 times in a row.

I know there are many vocal critics of this game, but I love it, the rules are simple but the fun is in trying to manipulate those rules to your advantage, and when you get it right you are not as restricted by the rules as you appear to be at the start.

Alas, just as I thought ... this turned out to be just a simultaneous solitaire game just like Dominion. Yes, there is a hint of interactivity and some minor causal connections between oneself and the other players, but why go for less ? I want a game that is so interactive, that makes a party at Corey Haim's house look pale in comparision. Give me auctions, conflicts, backstabbing, negotiation ! ! ! This is not what i would consider a real boardgame

Through the Desert but more fiddly and less strategic.

How on earth did this win the 2012 Spiel des Jahres? The game itself isn't very attractive, despite the professional art direction from Queen Games.

Modular board and variable objectives do not make a game replayable. Varied tactics and strategies do. See [gameid=188].

A great example that "simple" doesn't have to mean "mindless". Donald X. Vaccarino does it again - creates a title with few rules that plays amazingly well both with newcomers and experienced players alike.

It can be taught even to complete newbies in about 5 minutes and while the turns are blazingly fast, there are still many things to think about. The lenght of one game is perfect in relation to the number of decisions you have to make. One of those games you will play again, again and again, simply because it's engagin. There's no better word to describe "Kingdom Builder" - engaging.

Lighter than I had hoped and could benefit greatly from some expansions but very enjoyable. Quick game play and set up time. Easy to get to the table and play on the fly with gamers and non-gamers alike. Early game choices tend to lock people down or free them up and it is easy to be blinded by the random card draws making it difficult to see the strategy that lies beneath.

Shockingly underwhelmed. Abstract and straightforward - a sort of themed Ingenious.

I predict it will be forgotten by 2015.

This game for some reason just appeals to me.  You get one very limited decision per turn, which understandably turns a lot of people off. The game is very unforgiving if you make a mistake or wrong decision early in the game.  Your first turn is very critical.  I really enjoy it, but sometimes you have to be prepared to sit through a game you know you are going to lose if you mess up early.  Luckily, the game usually takes less than an hour with 4 players.

I am shocked and delighted at just how much fun my group and I have had with this. I've played with two, three and four players and love it with all numbers but it really shines with 3+

It's somewhat abstract and incredibly simple to teach and understand. Each play becomes deeper and more complex as the subtle nuances make themselves known like a fine chocolate melting on your tongue. The way different locations (powers) interact with various kingdom cards (objectives), the competition for prime locations and the luck factor that is just enough to add variety but not enough to be extremely frustrating. AP can occasionally be an issue, but not often and the speed at which this game can be played, reset and played again is a major plus for this highly addictive, beautifully designed game.

RATING: 6
A semi abstract, area control, area enclosure game with modular board, grid movement and route/network building.
Weight: Medium-Light.
Players: 2 to 5 players. Best with 3 or 4.

Impression: From the designer who brought us Dominion comes beautiful, light but thinky game where players are trying to spread their influence by building settlements (placing houses) throughout four corners of a kingdom, on six different terrain types and around mountains, lakes, capitols and structures that gives them various powerful, once per turn bonus actions. Settlements can be placed only on a terrain hex of a matching terrain card that is played AND only next to an existing settlement of the same color. This simple and brilliant design causes a lot of brain burning. For each game there are three different randomly selected scoring objectives. Also, in Big Box, which is huge, there is bunch of different terrain tiles, objective cards, bonus action locations and modules to keep game fresh for a very long time. And more expansions is on the way. Nice touch of the Big Box edition are the player pieces, which are houses of different color AND different shape. Components are generally pretty fine. So far the game was never not fun.

Likes: Setup variability: tons of different hexagonal grid terrains from which you chose four, different bonus action locations and different scoring objectives. Settlement placing mechanic. Wooden pieces differently shaped for each color.

Dislikes: Huge downtime with more players with nothing to do between turns, especially if the players are AP prone. Even planning is not viable because board state changes drastically during every player's turn. With more expansions setup and cleanup time is too long.

I love this game.  It requires very little luck.  The deck can hurt or help you a little, but you can mitigate it by the choices you make. The way the board is set gives this one massive replayability.

Sadly, in my circle, the way the players stack up at end game is usually the same.  It gets boring and frustrating when the same player always wins.  I guess it's time to look at expansions.

Even though you can only place buildings on the terrain of your randomly drawn card, this game has some depth how to cleverly position your buildings (to have more options in later turns) and how to use special ability tiles. The modular set up and different victory point conditions offer  a lot of replayability and the rules are explained very quickly. 

However, this game is in essence a pure abstract game. You just place "houses", without any economy and the only goal of meeting the arbitrary victory point goal. In the end you also do not feel to have accomplished much, since you could build a certain number of houses each turn anyway. Additionally the art work is too colorful and the design in general not really appealling.

Some people are a bit down on this game since it follows Dominion as the designer's second game and at first I get it why people are down on it.  This game takes a couple plays to understand that it is strategic.  At first it feels like it plays itself and you're just going through the motions but then after a awhile something clicks as you discover there is something very strategic and tactical to this game.  Yes it is random with one card draw but it's how you use this one card draw with the extra actions and what order they are done that really is the heart of this game which actually really for me has the same feel as Dominion  yet is a completely different style game. Great re-playability to this game with the different combos of boards and kingdom (objective scoring) cards.  You know a good game when you keeping talking about it long after the game has ended and this did that.  Just another great Queen Games game.  Another plus is that this games has simple enough directions that we'll be able to pick up and play it anytime.  

Update:  this game gets better and better the more you play.  We just keep discovering new strategies and the decisions just can be really difficult towards the end of the game however, the rules are just so simple and game play is still quick.  This game would be rated much higher if all the raters would play multiple times.  A game just blasting up my ratings and may not be done rising.

RATING: 4
Each turn players randomly draw a card representing a particular type of terrain. They may then play three settlements into terrain of that type anywhere on the board but adjacent to an already played piece if they can.
There will be three cards in play which have conditions under which settlements score points (for example: adjacent cities, adjacent to seas). 
At the end of the game the players add up their scores and the highest score wins. Its all very simple and very euro and I suspect the first player should win just about every game.

This is one of those games you simply cannot judge after just one play, I would say it takes 6 plays minimum for this game to grow on you.  I was disappointed at first, like so many have already stated, it just seemed too simple and a little dull with not much depth. The more I play it the more interesting it becomes. 

The game is on the light side but still quite fun for families and filler games. The bad thing though is the setup is kind of a pain for a filler.

In 2 player games we only use 3 boards.

Still one of my top rated game. Goes to show that not every SDJ has to be a family game with fixed rule set and a gateway game without legs.

In fact Kingdom Builder has so much variability that while the (first few at leat) expansions add some game to it I don't think they are necessary to extend replayability.

Okay. I love this one. It gets a lot of hate and rightfully so in some aspects. I am stunned that the designer thought it would be a great idea to have a hand of one card. I think it sucks that way. I also am not a fan of house ruling games. To make a house rule changing the number of cards in your hand just doesn't seem right. With that said, each time we play, I enjoy it despite this flaw. I know I am in the minority in this and that's okay.

RATING: 6
When I read the rules, the game sounded great.  When I played, I was underwhelmed.  I sometimes randomly missed turned because of a bad draw, and I couldn't execute any kind of long term strategy.  There are some choices on a turn, but it is only a subtle influence on a mostly random game.

One game, I drew the same terrain almost every turn, and had basically no choices.  On another, I drew lots of variety and scored very well.  Maybe if I knew in advance the terrains coming, I could plan.

update:  it does get better with more plays, as long as you know that you absolutely must get the right special power on turn 1.  Even then, there is quite a lot of luck but it's not nearly as bad as it seems at first.

update:  boy does the game drag with more than 2.  Interaction is low, so the game is really best with just the minimum 2 players.

Fast playing placement/area majority type of game.  You have very little control over where you build as the cards are completely random.  This also means if you mess up with a placement or two, you might never get a chance to fix it and catch up to other players.  You have to be very careful with your placement especially early on as that will determine the rest of the game.  Plays fast enough to be enjoyable.

Nice simple almost minimalist rules. Nifty varying powers and ways to earn points and map setup each game.

My only concern is whether the one element of randomness, namely the important terrain card draw each turn, is too much randomness. Possibly house rules can fix it if so. But so far we're enjoying it as is.

(UPDATE 2012-08-04: we sometimes play with my randomless variant: you simply choose your terrain type each turn. That works fine!)

I believe many negative comments are from people who only read the rules or only played once or twice and overstate the impact of randomness. The early turns are crucial and you can lessen the possible damage of the randomness, but that is not obvious the first time you play.

Played 4-er at Essen, bought it, playing 2-ers at home and continuing to enjoy it.

This is a VERY light game.  It is easy and quick.  We played it as 2 player and it is just plain too easy.  I think that if you played it as a larger game, it would be better, but as two player there needs to be some rule variations to make it harder.  There just is no meat here...and honestly I like light games,  but this was too simple for me. (JW)

It has enough variety to make multiple plays in a row feel very different from each other. It is super easy to teach. Yet there is enough decision making in the game to give you a sense of control. Fun.

An interesting, but light, gateway-filler. After my first play, I immediately wanted to give this another go. There's a lot of luck, and the "take a card play a card" seems a bit restrictive, but the game plays fast enough for it not to be an issue. The variability of the board setup and scoring conditions seems like it will give Kingdom Builder a lot of longevity.

I really dislike the art used on the main board segments. The colors are extremely garish and bland. Also, I hope Queen hasn't decided to print in China for all their games, because the production quality is a bit lacking. I'm guessing subsequent expansions will really open up the strategic possibilities of this game. I look forward to seeing that and trying Kingdom Builder again.

If you are only going to try this once, don't waste your time. You need to play at least twice, if only to recognize all the things you did wrong on your first play. Great for what it is: a quick-playing abstract.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.3
Title is very misleading - you have to accept it as a great abstract game.
ALSO!!!!!! We play the game by drawing 2 land cards each turn rather than 1, and choose which card we use for all actions, discarding the other. This reduces the possibilities of  VERY BORING games which can occur if you are the last player AND you draw identical land types in the first 2 turns, which usually shuts you out of the game completely. That is the basis of my 8.3 rating, otherwise it would only be about 7.0.

Sooooo simple, So beautiful, my boardgame. Playing with one card rule makes it very strategic game you need to plan for every eventuality for every card you could receive, that is true power of this game and i prefer playing this way. Playing with two cards variant makes it less demanding and boring in process

I didn't think I would like this light Eurogame, but I did. It is easy to explain, and the varying set ups in terms of boards/special buildings and victory conditions give it a decent level of variety. If you are looking for a game to play with non-gamers, and are sick of Settlers of Catan, this is a very good option.

RATING: 6.85
This game is neither more or less than it promises. I understand how it could be disappointing to some, but I actually do enjoy this game. The complaints about a singular card do make sense to me, but you get enough choices off that one card that I think that adding even one more card to players' hands could significantly lengthen this game. The best plays aren't obvious and Kingdom Builder does force you to think outside the box. I like it.

I heard that this was a disappointing game, and had trouble believing that the designer of Dominion could produce such a thing, though I suppose he had set the bar pretty high.  This has nothing at all in common with Dominion other than the designer, however, so it's probably not right to compare them... much.

This game felt simply wrong, and as we began I had trouble accepting that we were playing by the correct rules.  Draw a card, place a building on that terrain.  Try to fulfill the patterns which comprise the objectives for the match, which change each match.  It all felt contrived, and decisions seemed trivial to make.

I have read some praises, by those who enjoy and recommend the game, which seem to indicate that deep and nuanced play emerges with experience.  I stand by that the decisions, and completing the victory objectives, felt trivial to me, so I imagine that higher skill in this game must consist of evaluating all of the options - all of the different Forests you can play on, since you drew a Forest - and determining which one leaves the most favourable options on following turns, given what remains in the deck and what your opponents are doing.  That's legitimate, but if this is the attraction to the game, is this abstracted possibility-pondering more engaging than what you'd get from playing something like, say, Chess?

In any case, it doesn't matter to me, because what's lacking for me is any compelling reason at all to want to become experienced with this game.  It feels dry, there's no theme (just like Dominion), and the mechanics don't do anything to excite me (very unlike Dominion).  I'd be willing to play it again, but I'd rather play almost any other game that I've tried.

The theme is a bit mystifying, but fields of flowers always make for a nice setting. There are few meaningful decisions and game kind of works itself out like puzzle. The special powers in the hexes are not riveting. It might be more fun if there was more conflict or player interaction other than a little blocking. Carc has more theme than this one. 

Still it's not un-fun as you try to hit all the VP elements as you move along. I read about a two-card draw variant where you pick one or the other to use--sounds like an improvement. More interesting boards might also be cool rather than just seemingly balanced blends. It plays quickly which is a strength. Might be fun with 10-second timers for turns.

This game looks like all the things that turn me off about most Euros; the horribly bland theme, the horribly bland art work, the pretty generic game bits. But I got wrangled into a game of it and fell in love. There is just something about putting little wood houses onto a board that felt so satisfying. It's a fun light game with some depth and I really enjoy it (even if I still wish it was nicer to look at).

RATING: 9
  I see this is a very polarizing game on the discussion boards but so far I would come down on the side of "I like it!"  I like the way the game changes based on what boards/goals have been pulled.  I personally LIKE the constraint of "you have to play next to a previous play if you can."  It means you have to think a few moves ahead.  While I stink at that in other games, I kind of get it here.

The overwhelming merit is replayability. Random r elements generally make the game lighter but do also provide for interesting choices. Nice bits!

For 2 players I strongly recommend mantuanwar's variant where one kingdom card is face up, and each player has one kingdom card that only they know - but which both players will score from. It adds exactly the right amount of uncertainty and potential for bluffing to spice the game up - possibly making KB a better game with 2 than more.

RATING: 6
Rating after 3 games. There is a lot I like about KB. I like the hunt for the optimal move, weighing the pros and cons of each placement. I like the emphasis on strategy, comparing the scoring cards with the randomized geography and planning all of your future placements accordingly. However, I have a single major concern. I'm concerned that when all players are at similar skill levels (usually the ideal situation for the best game), the end scores will be the direct result of who can acquire the *most* action tokens and who can acquire them the *earliest*. That's what the early game seems to be all about. And at even an average level of play, it becomes fairly straightforward to make a judgement about how to place your houses in order to accomplish the "most/earliest" goal given the terrain card you are dealt and any action tiles you may already have collected. In other words, I'm concerned that the outcome of the game may be too connected with early game luck. Certainly, you could say that all skill games have this quality (luck decides the winner with equally skilled players). But my preference would be for the design of the game to *obfuscate* this as much as possible. I fear that KB may not obfuscate it at all... making it very annoyingly obvious that a player won at the end of 60 minutes because luck allowed him to collect more action tiles and/or collect them earlier than other players within the first 15 minutes. For now, I will agree to play KB and my inevitable analysis of this issue will be the focal point of of my experience. I would say my rating is highly subject to change as I develop a more solid judgment on the issue.

RATING: 5
Five different terrain types scattered throughout the land. Some cut off by water and impassable mountains. You build your settlement out three spaces at a time, trying to connect to cities and other powerful spaces that alter the basic placement rules. Three random victory point condition cards (drawn at the beginning of the game), give you varying goals to maximise your victory points from game to game.

The game is a little dull for my taste. The cards dictate too much of my placement decisions compared to more simplified games in the same genre (like Through the Desert), where my choices are more open and up to me. This would be a great gateway game for some, but it doesn't pique my interest. Although it's quick, I'd rather reserve precious gaming time for something else.

This is a nice simple game with variable scoring.

An ok game that suffers from the massive expectations. We enjoyed it a bit but certainly wouldn't be looking to add it to our collection at this point.

Kingdom Builder is ok.  It's quick and easy-to-learn and it's enjoyable for what it is, but I'm not in an overly big hurry to play it again.  You get one card per turn, place houses, and there are varying conditions to score points.  This game epitomizes the "meh" game.

Just like Dominion, I had no real interest in seeking this game out.  Just like Dominion, I was talked into playing it at a game gathering.  Just like Dominion, I was pleasantly surprised.

While I did enjoy the game and hope to play a fair amount more, I do not see it being as well loved as Dominion.  I do enjoy the variable board set-ups along with the variable powers and scoring that are available in each game.  I also like the constraints on adding your pieces to the board.  To me, there are some quite interesting opportunities for good plays, perhaps even some obnoxious play.  Of course, there is plenty of space for numerous expansions.  Unlike Dominion, I'm not sure that I will ever play this enough to justify many (any?) expansions.

All in all, a pleasant game that I hope to get to play even more.  [07/07/2012]

RATING: 5.5
Initial rating. 

I like it, I could get hooked on it, if I could ever get afford/borrow a copy. 

It's a spatial puzzle game of sorts where different players are trying to solve the same puzzle in a couple of different ways and blocking one another. A lot of game is about reading the scoring cards and adapting the strategy based on them, the special tiles and the spacial paths possible. Very simple to learn, but a grower - needs more plays to "get". As the game gives you one card you must use, the key is to position oneself so that any card could give you something of benefit (or just ignore this level and run with it).

My only problem is the visuals. There's no theme and that's okay, but the map is kinda ugly to me. The canyon, really? Not the best choice. Also the flower field looks kinda, ... wallpaperish. There must be a better visual way to represent this game.

2015: 7. Comparisons with Reiner Knizia's Through the Desert are unavoidable, and valid IMO.  This feels like a more "gamer" version of TTD, but bolting on a few new mechanics and some randomized scoring goals/board set up/special abilities.  I think the trick and the genius is that it does this without making the game play any longer or feel any more complex, which is done mainly through the "railroading" affect of the terrain cards.

I think I prefer the more static TTD, but Kingdom Builder is no slouch.

Ultra light tile laying game (reminds me of Through the Desert a little) where each turn, players play three meeples, I mean houses, to match their played terrain card. The game ends when a player runs out of houses. All other players play one more turn. 

Scores are tallied according to variable conditions determined by flipping open three cards (out of 10 total) before the game. VPs for building next to a mine hex etc. There are special location tiles where players can grab one of two tokens granting special actions such as the ability to move a tile two hexes, playing another house on a certain terrain etc. The hexes go fast and furious with three or four players and thankfully, analysis paralysis is reduced by limited actions and house placement each turn.

Not terribly exciting or nailbiting but clips along quickly enough that I wouldn't turn down a game. A minus for the HORRIBLE board design. Looks like a dog's breakfast.

Someone said that "from the designer of Dominion you wouldn't expect a total disaster as the next release". On the contrary, you *would* expect a total disaster, since they are famous now and nobody would bother to double-check the game for quality as long as they can put "from the designer of" onto the box. To be fair, it's not entirely horrible, and for, say, 10 EUR, I might even be willing to buy it as a filler game. I mean, you place houses according to some rules -- mostly "draw a random landscape and place three houses on that landscape, adjacent to your existing houses if possible" --, and try to fulfill some scoring rules -- in our case "place in as many different rows as possible", "have the biggest blob", and "place next to as much water as possible". It plays in 15 to 30 minutes, unless someone starts to micro-optimize. (You know who you are.)

I didn't like this one. It's an abstract piece placement game like go or Through the Desert, but you have to play where your card tells you to play. I don't mind some luck of the draw, but not in a dry strategy game like this.

Very minimalistic, yet clever and deep. Play is very abstract, much more so then the title seems to imply. Its really not a thematic game.
The luck element seems to be rather strong sometimes, as much can depend on what card one gets.

Played the lite version of this on iPad and liked it!

Played it again at BGGcon a couple times; owned it and got rid of it a couple times. I don't know what my problem is. I guess just a little too abstract for my tastes, and nobody else seemed interested.

Akkor kezdett érdekelni a játék, mikor egymás után több partit játszottak le egy mellettem levő asztalnál belőle és hangos dicséretek hangzottak közben. Tehát gyors és tetszik a társaságnak. A játék beváltotta az előzetes reményeket. Nagyon gyors is lehet, akár 20 perc alatt is lemehet egy játék és nagyon változatos. 8 térképrészletből sosem az összes játszik. Ezáltal a térképrészletekhez tartozó bónuszlapkák is mindig mások. A játékban elérhető pontok szintén sokféle kártyákon vannak, amiből 3 kerül minden játékban elő. Tehát ez is változatos, ami nem, az az egy darab akció, amit egy darab kártyán kapunk meg minden körben. Nagyon érdekes ötlet. A játék nagyon egyszerű. Különböző felszíntípusokra az adott egy kártya alapján rakhatjuk le három házunkat folytatólagosan. A három célkártya valamilyen módon díjazza a játékosok által lerakott házakat, amikor elfogy valakinek minden háza, a kör még lemegy és pontozás következik. Ennyi a játék. Akár gyerekekkel is játszható, nagyon egyszerű, nagyon változatos, nagyon jó taktikai játék. Egy 7-est adok rá elsőnek, de ez egy nagyon erős hetes, nagyon valószínű több játék után felfelé fog nőni a pontszám.

Nem nő a pontszám, továbbra is nagyon erős hetes. 3-an még pörgősebb a játék.

Super simple, quick connection game.  Great variable powers and scoring conditions that make for fun little puzzles.  Perhaps there may be too much downtime from players that want to use all their superpowers optimally. While I'm not normally an AP guy, if played right the combos can really push your position.  This kicks Through the Desert in the ass.  Great filler.

I like Dominion but I am not a huge fan ... 

After only a single play of Kingdom Builder, I can state that i am much more impressed with this game than I thought I would be.  After reading about it and watching numerous videos I thought I would give it a try but fully expected it to be another game that sees limited plays.

My children and I all fully enjoyed it and everyone is looking forward to the next play, which is a rare thing as my children move into their teens.  Everyone is able to follow their own strategy and the "buildings" you acquire can tactically manipulate the board to improve your position and minimize your opponent's much more effectively than I imagined.  

The real bonus is the level of diversity through the variety of setups !

Update April 2017
I respect this game, but ultimately decided to sell it. It is certainly deeper than meets the eye, but my tastes just kind of shifted after a while. I never really wanted to pull it out anymore. 
------------------------------------------------------

This is a light-ish game that is fast, fun, and easy to learn. My roommates and I have been playing it a lot since we've gotten it. We like to put the boards in odd positions which give a fun appearance. Sometimes we will use 2 boards to play a speed round. Variations are lots of fun. Not sure if it's worth the $60 price-tag.

It may have its flaws, but I still find it fun to play. The game does seem incomplete. I will be interested to see what the expansions will bring to the game.

As of now, it's an easy game to fit into my busy schedule.

I got this game for more than 50% off during a 30th anniversary celebration of a local gaming shop. I remember being interested in it but didn't know a lot about it other than the designer. When I first read the rules I was worried that it would be way too light and simplistic. This game has turned out to be a lot more interesting than it first appeared.

While your basic turn consists of laying 3 pieces onto the board in an attempt to score points, the combination of random goals and special powers and clever piece placement can create some really interesting strategies. Add to this some of the most impressive diversity between game sessions (due to random boards, random goals, and random powers available) and the short play length and I imagine I will be playing this game for a very long time to come. It's quick to setup and teach as well. Excellent game, especially for the (discounted) $20 I paid for it.

I guess my only complaints would be that you can really suffer from back luck if you get a few useless cards in a row and players who have played it more will probably beat new players very soundly, which may turn off new players...

UPside- quick-playing, clever, addicting spatial game with a lot of variability and expansion content, making KB highly replayable.

MIDpoint- although it is a light game, it can a bit thinky at times.

DOWNside- although the game with expansions works with up to 5P, the game setup does not change with higher player counts so there might be a scaling issue at higher player counts (lack of tokens and they can be harder to get).

Not at all what I expected.  Very simple gameplay - play the one card you have, and place houses where it tells you.  Variable victory conditions, board layout, and special powers give the game more longevity.  Will it be a popular gateway game?  I doubt this game will build a following like Dominion.

It's taken me three plays to truly appreciate Kingdom Builder, but I'm liking the game more each time I play it.  The first time you play you just feel a bit lost, even though the rules are so simple.  More plays get you a lot more comfortable with the system.  I think this is going to become more of a winner as time goes on and expansions continue to be released.  *Update* - 20 plays through and I still can't get enough.  A true played 10. *Second Update* I've hit 30, but I can't say this is still a 10 anymore.  It's starting to lose it's luster for me.  But heck, 30 plays!

The first time I'd played Kingdom Builder I wasn't sure how much I liked it. It was a quick play of a game that seemed to end shortly after it began. I knew I liked connection games, and I could see that Kingdom Builder had a nice mix of strategy and tactics, but I wasn't sure how deep it was. I wasn't sure whether the system was robust enough to stand up to many plays. But I wanted to play again to find out. It was different.

Fast forward two years. My tastes have changed. The board game industry has changed. One day I saw the base game and the Crossroads expansion on sale at clearance prices. I seized the opportunity. I'm glad I did. Whatever the reason, I like it more now than I did then. I get it now: when time flies by, as it did when I first played years ago, there's a reason.

Always a good time and doesn't take too long to play, but it's not usually one I suggest for some reason. I don't have the data, but I suspect that with my wife's superior spatial reasoning skills, she probably wins more often than I do which may have something to do with it.

1 play, 4er

Oh, how annoying of a game is this?! The rules made it seem as if it would be fun -- a light, clever, quick little game with a lot of reply (randomly chosen boards/pieces/VP conditions every game, with a huge number of different combos possible). But then you play it and you find that you actually have almost no control at all ... the game almost plays itself! Yes, perhaps that a bit of an exaggeration, but with only one random card in hand, and the rule that you must play adjacent to previously placed houses, there's very little room for making actual decisions!

I doubt I'd play this with rules as written. But even something as simple as giving people a hand of 2-3 cards, or letting them draw 2 cards per turn from which to choose which to play (and discard the other?) would probably make this much more interesting.

--- Summary ---
Random board setup, consisting of 4 large boards covered with hex spaces of various terrain types, several city sites, and several action-tile sites. Randomly choose 4 special powers and place their tokens on the indicated spaces. Randomly choose some (3) end-of-game VP card. Deal each player a random terrain card (deck has every type of terrain except water).

On your turn, must take a mandatory action; may take optional action(s) if you've collected the tokens that allow you to do so. The mandatory action = one at at time, place 3 houses on the board:
- max 1 house/hex
- must match terrain of card being played (if possible)
- must be adjacent to any of your previously placed houses (if possible)
- if you place a house next to an action-tile space for the first time, take that action-tile (if any still present there)
The optional action(s) may be taken either before or after the mandatory one. These generally allow you to place an additional house:
- in a specific terrain type (determined by the tile) or in a specific location (e.g., edge of board, or in a line with 3 of your other houses)
- must be adjacent to any of your previously placed houses (if possible)

The game ends at the end of the round in which anyone placed their last (of 40) house. Score VP:
- 2 per city you are touching
- based on the previously revealed end-game VP cards (e.g., points for having houses in a row, or for connecting locations, etc.)
Most VP wins.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.1
Interesting, but the ability to plan seems low. Look  around the board, see which spot gives you the most points, and probably go there. You MIGHT not wan't to go if it limits choice latter, but it seems like just a little planing if the first 10 or so moves will put one on a track, then you just play the numbers. I don't mind numbers, but I would like later plays to have more meaning than just being another zero to 6 points. And often enough it is zero, which makes the game frustrating.

A great puzzle that plays out quickly and differently each time, while having just enough theme to be the only abstract I have played that evokes a sense of accomplishment.  Luck factor is only an issue until you realize that luck is just another obstacle to overcome, and there are indeed ways to do so.  Collecting special powers is like a micro-engine building exercise, and the flexibility is using them before or after your mandatory action is what makes each play feel much more fluid and less rigid than the average abstract game.  It also doesn't hurt that, in my mind, this is as close as we are gonna get to Dominion: the boardgame.    

Very much undervalued by the BGG masses.  (And the masses in general.)

RATING: 6
This is an abstract game with a pretty coating.  The gameplay itself is super simple.  Each turn a player has a terrain type that he builds 3 buildings onto.  The buildings need to touch an already built building, unless they can't.  This makes for a decent amount of strategy behind such simple rules and gameplay.  The points all come from 3 goal cards that reward points based on different criteria and this will dictate where players are going to want to build their buildings.

At the end of the day this is just an abstract game and I'm not a big abstract game fan, they just don't excite me.  But there is still a lot of polish and a surprising amount of depth to this game.  The game still doesn't excite me but I wouldn't mind playing it if asked.

As a fan of light strategical games I fell in love with this one effortlessly. It has something of a Settlers on the next level to me. The trick of having 3 different scoring goals (vary from game to game) that don't always support each other is great. A changing board and simple to learn rules create a fantastic, in-depth game. Only two plays and I already feel addicted. This is totally my kind of game.

Very good family board game by Donald X., which may be a contender for the SdJ. Like with Dominion, you have to pick a strategy from the start and place your houses accordingly. If you play this smart from the start, there's almost no need to let your fate be determined by the cards you draw. The bonus tiles are very important for this and they need to be considered when picking a strategy. This gives the game enough to think about for hobby gamers like us, but it's still simple enough for families.

On the first play I thought I would still prefer to play Hacienda (a long term favourite), and overall that is still perhaps the case, but after another game I can see what Kingdom Builder has to offer - speed and variety. Being as short a game as it is, there is the opportunity to seek immediate revenge - without knowing which variation in set-up you will be coping with the second time around.

I got this game on clearance and was expecting something completely different. For what I paid for it, it is a good game. Yes, there is a fair amount of luck that drives this game as you are limited to a single card draw as to where you can place your next pieces, but the luck mitigation is what drives your tactical approach. I have no intention of getting any of the "big box" expansions as I do not play it enough to justify them.

This is a quick playing, and ever-changing abstract game.  It's a super deal with all the expansions.  It's not a game that I find wishing I could be playing all the time, but I can't imagine turning a game down--the changing goals and set-up are just too interesting.

This is an 8 as a two player game, but the rating goes rapidly down as the player count increases.  At 5 I consider it completely broken...a 1, literally.  Unless player 1 and 2 and 3 draw absolutely the worst possible card, and player 5 draws the best, play 5 CANNOT win.  CANNOT.  Seriously, the 5th player cannot win with averaged luck.  That's broken.  In a 4 player game, player 4 CANNOT win unless the first two players have very bad luck and player 4 has good luck. CANNOT win.  Really.  In this respect, this is one of the worst Spiel des Jahres games we've played.

But it's good with two--excellent even.  Is solid with 3.  Broken with 4.  And don't even bother with 5. 

It doesn't play quick enough to encourage multiple plays to balance the turn order advantage--we'd rather play any single game for 2-3 hours, rather than multiple broken play-throughs for balance.  The game goes on WAAAAAY past it's interest-point.  You should probably cut the number of houses in half to 20 or 30 at most and just score it there.  The results, from the dozens of plays we've seen, would, quite literally, be identical to a full playthrough--player 1 or 2 would win, with players 3 and 4 competitive with each other, but strongly behind 1 and 2.

It may be fixable with a single-use, break-the-adjacency rule chit for player 3 and 4, maybe two for player 5.  I'll update my rating if that works, but so far...disappointing

Nope the problem is that you cannot "fix" the problem because sometimes there is no problem and then the "fix" breaks the game in the other direction, strongly favoring players 4 & 5.

I really want to like this game since the variable set-up and replayability are HUGE.  But the fact that a fair number of games are broken from the start is just BAD.

A very simple, semi-abstract game of area control and network building where each turn you can expand your kingdom into 1 territory, with the occasional special bonus action.

I would never argue with someone not liking this game.  Yes it's abstracted, yes your choice are limited during your turn, yes the luck of draw can be punishing; this still hits a sweet spot for me. I like to be limited in my choices and having to optimize my move and the use of the specials powers to score better than my opponents.

I think this is a great, simple game, but it's important to explain exactly how the placement rules work to new players. Half of the game is managing the benefits of developing certain regions with the drawbacks of being stuck placing there on later turns when matching terrains are drawn. 

Prefer to house-rule a two-card instead of single-card draw for a bit of added strategic ability. Love the varied scoring mechanics and the wide variety of power tiles added in the expansions.

I like Kingdom Builder a lot: nice quick filler that satisfies a spatial itch that Dominion can't. There's certainly more depth to the game than its critics would have you believe, but poor card draws can be a real problem -- mitigated by good play, of course, but still an unsatisfying problem.

A year later, it has become one of my favourite games. It scales well from 2-4 (I think adding the Nomads' 5th is a mistake) and it only gets better with the expansions.

Fantastic.

A game that can be enjoyed equally by our parents and friends, non-gamers and gamers? Yes please!

Strategy creeps on you as familiarity with the cards, maps and special powers increases. Simple rules but rewarding game play experience and hidden depth.

My wife remarked on her first play that it reminded her of Ingenious in some ways. Seeing as that is her favorite game, no wonder she loved this.

This has become our current favorite for quick, after work, weekday gaming. 

One negative is that it loses some tension in 2P.

Jan 2012:  A clear winner here.  I think it might turn out to wear very well, in which case my rating will go up.  PS Sept 2015:  Thumbs down instead.  Can be fun if you're in the competition, but you can through luck of the draw be genuinely hopeless, and it's no fun sitting through that.

Update 7/2012
Had to downgrade my rating slightly. Kingdom Builder is a fine game most of the time. However, I've run into a situation (multiple times) where I find myself in predicaments I can't escape. Meaning: I always draw the wrong cards and can't otherwise improve my score. Meanwhile, I watch my opponents run away with the game. Likewise, I've seen this happen to my opponents and *I* run away with the game. To be clear, there is room for tactical maneuvering -- some of the time. But when you get yourself "boxed in" it can be a drag.

One might say "Well, then don't let yourself get boxed in." This is partly fair. But it seems a 30-45 minutes game should have safeguards to prevent it being lost in the first five.

==

Doesn't feel like a gateway game to me. Maybe a few steps beyond the gate? I feel like there's more depth here than in Ticket to Ride or Carcassonne (both of which, I feel, aptly deserve the gateway label). I love the variable setup of the board and the unique scoring opportunities that will crop up each game. The game has a very pleasant air about it. Simple to play, getting a bit heavier as the game goes on, and ending just before it gets too heavy. Highly recommended.

Place pieces to gain powers, and score. Scoring (in particular) varies from game to game - and the 3 random scoring cards largely dictate your strategy for the game. Limited interaction - certainly less blocking than Through the Desert, for example.

I wish I liked this game better.  It's not bad but it's just not quite ... interesting enough.  I like the modular board and the replay value inherent in the various combinations of board pieces and scoring conditions available.  But good replay value isn't worth much if I'm not enthusiastic enough to play it again.  I'd like to try this with three or four players and see if I like it better, but the two player game, at least, is rather a dud.

RATING: 10
I was skeptical of this one initially (you only play one card per turn?) but it has quickly become a favorite of ours.  There are some really difficult decisions and contingency planning in this one, and it sets up and plays really fast.  Pay no attention to the critics who say there are only obvious decisions.  You have to balance short-term and long-term points, special abilities, strategic blocking, and board position carefully or you'll end up stranded in the desert.

RATING: 7
I played this at Essen 2011 and didnt like it at all. It seemed far too simple, with hardly any decisions to make.

With the iPad release I bought myself a copy and came to appreciate the game a lot more. There are important decisions to make, especially early on when you decide where to place your first settlements. Placing them semi-randomly will severely limit your options for the rest of the game. The extra actions you can acquire through settlement placement are also way more important than it first seems - it's not easy to see how powerful they are at first glance.

I still have 2 major problems with the game though:
1. Usually, if a game involves card drawing, you assume that the cards give you strategic or tactical options. In Kingdom Builder they are really only a randomizer which is completely counterintuitive. This misunderstanding frustrates a lot of people who find their expectations are not met at all.

2. The Dominion theme was obviously just tacked on for marketing reasons. Same theme, same author, good sales. It's a very abstract game really, the theme doesn't make too much sense. Only thing it does (besides generating sales) is, again, create expectations that it can't satisfy.

It's still a very good game, very suited for family play, but make sure to understand what it is and what it is not. Don't be fooled by the medieval card-drawing disguise.

This game is devoid of almost any decisions and is decidedly unfunded. I like easy light games but this offers nothing at all.

Wow, was I wrong on my first couple plays.  This game is brilliant, but it's really the little things that make it good.  You have to exploit the rules wherever possible and maximize usage of the special tiles.  The Devil is in the details.

I'm wiling to eat my humble pie. This game is great. Variable setup, quick play, little downtime. It works great for two.  This is becoming one of my all time faves.

Vaccarino is a master at building games with near infinite replayability and Kingdom Builder is no exception. Our group has already sunk many hours into this game. That said, the rules can be a bit choppy the first time you read them, and some of the Kingdom Cards can be vague. Hopefully this owes to some translation issues from Queen Games. Don't let that hold you back from adding this game to your collection.

RATING: 7
Simple strategy game with variable boards and victory conditions. There are eight inter-changeable board sections and four of these are placed together at the start of the game. Three separate victory conditions are then revealed from a deck of 10 cards and the game proceeds. Players draw a single terrain card and then have to place their settlements on the matching terrain on the board whilst trying to meet the victory conditions, which range from receiving points from having settlements in a horizontal line, having settlements adjoining a mountain, having settlements separate from one another etc. The gameplay is extraordinarily simple but this game takes a fair bit of skill to play well, and not only that, it is fun to play. Factor in the ever-changing board and victory conditions and you have a game which does genuinely feel different enough each time you play it to merit several replays.

Kingdom Builder is a strange one. It doesn't give a good first impression, so I can understand why some folks right it off after just one play. However, after my first play I was intrigued. You really need to give it a few plays and it will click, and all of a sudden you can see the strategy and depth beneath the simple rules. 

Funny how so many people give the game a ton of flack for being so simple, yet they clearly don't understand it.

A fast playing area control/link building game. As with all games from this designer, there is a point made to make it replayable which it certainly is.

I'm not honestly sure how many times I'd want to play the game though. It's fast and simple and the scoring cards vary each time (all of these should make me love the game) but it ultimately left me feeling a little empty. It's a bit soulless.

It just missed for me and I'm not honestly sure why.

Update: I think some scoring cards are more interesting than others. Perhaps I now just know what I'm doing. Up from 6.1 to 6.9. Updated again from 6.9 to 7.3 after 7 plays. I still don't love it, but it is fast and relatively enjoyable.

Down from 7.3 to 6.4 again as it really can become far too downtimey with a few players who have lots of bonus tokens. Much more downtimey than this game needs to be. It is horrible with 5 as well.

The restrictions causes that you don`t have so much options.

The more I play it, the more I've enjoyed it. Playing it electronically has shown me a lot to the game. My first impression was that luck was too much a part of the game, but  smart play really mitigates the luck - initial placement is often the key - getting the right additional power so that you are not trapped by your card each round makes all the difference. 

It is possible to occasionally get hosed by luck, but games are generally so fast that this isn't so bad.

This game continues to grow on me the more I play it.

Lack of choices. While usually not a plus, it drives the game.
Plan ahead for what is to come.

Kingdom builder is simple enough to teach and people usually want to play again. Teaching (realizing) the difference between a straight arrow logo and the curved arrow logo has helped.

Kingdom Builder reminds me a bit of Through the Desert, where players are building chains of pieces and connecting to points of interest. The main twist in Kingdom Builder is players build through various terrain that limits placement. This works well in Through the Desert, as players simply garner points, so a player with a slowly developing strategy can certainly catch up. In Kingdom Builder, however, players gain special powers at connection points that allow them to break placement rules and place more pieces. The problem with this, of course, is that players who are doing well gain the ability to do even better, leading to a runaway leader problem. The rich get richer in Kingdom Builder, and there's no way for a player who falls behind to crawl back into contention. In addition to balance issues, I simply didn't find the choices here all that interesting. An average game at its best, Kingdom Builder's rich-get-richer tendency thrusts the game squarely into the subpar strata for me.

Good gateway. Plays quick and since the options for each move are limited there is not much reason for analysis paralysis. But you still feel you have some control and there are decisions to make. There is some interaction and screwage as well as developing your own position. The game plays differently depending on scoring cards and map layout, and sometimes it can be less interesting and exciting.

Kingdom Builder is a spatial abstract game in Euro clothing that reminded me a lot of Through the Desert with just a dash of Cosmic Encounter (terrain deck = destiny deck). 

It's highly modular, with different map setups, bonus actions, and sources for scoring, but I haven't figured out if that's a good thing or a bad thing for an abstract game.  I lean towards it being a good thing.  My rating has the potential to rise with experience.

Hated the fact that I only had 1 card to choose from (i.e. no choice at all) and felt railroaded.  If they change the rules to give players more options, I will re-consider.

And to those condescendingly saying that we "don't get it" or suggesting that it is too "subtle" for us, we actually do get it, but we just don't like it.  Your smugness and imagined superiority are comments on yourself rather than about those who do not like the game.  Learn to accept that some people simply have different tastes without being derogatory.

RATING: 6
By placing settlement tokens on different kinds of terrain, players score points, gain special abilities, and try to outmaneuver their opponents. There is a lot of opportunity for clever play, but the rules are simple.

The board is modular, which means that there are a huge number of possibilities for what the play-space will be, and the methods for scoring points in each game are determined randomly at the start. There is so much variety in the game that it should remain fun for a long time, despite the thin theme and simple rules.

There are scoring cards that show what you need to do to gain points each game, and then you draw a card that tells you almost exactly where to place your houses onto the board. Through the Desert offers similar gameplay but is better in every way: much more strategic, better with different player counts, more interaction.

Sold.

I have a strange relationship with Kingdom Builder. I play it regularly with my wife and we are morbidly fascinated by it. I'm not sure either of us get it, and we're not sure if we actually enjoy it, but we're going to keep playing until we find out. It's like picking a scab, or pulling a loose tooth.

When talking about the "Donald" and his games, I will always choose Kingdom Builder over Dominion. Dominion has too many hiccups for me personally to enjoy it. Kingdom Builder is just a lot smoother and quicker. I was unsure if it would be any good after seeing how low it was rated after Essen, but I am very happy to have bought it. It is the family game of choice currently. My seven year old totally gets it and the game is teaching him how to use long term strategies. My four year old gets it well enough to actually play. I enjoy seeing how things develop and watching my children foil my plans.

Quite an engaging abstract that feels like Through the Desert but with greater replayability. I actually like the fact that where you play each turn is limited to the card you draw although I can see why some people may think this makes the element of chance too pronounced. I think this game has the potential to improve with more plays, but even now I prefer it over Donald X's other slightly better known game. Initial rating of 7.

Snore. You get to play your card, place a settlement, maybe use a "special power" (they get really repetitive really soon), while trying to hit one of the three goals everyone was issued at the beginning.

Every game is at least different. But none of them are very interesting. Tension and involvement are almost completely lacking.

I really want to like this game more (not that I dislike it, it's a great game) but I'm struggling with the extreme abstract feel it has. This game does NOT feel like building kingdoms at all. It feels like placing cubes and leveraging acquired algorithms to place or move more cubes. Nothing about the game even feels remotely like castle building. I really think this game would be well served with a redesign. Still, I wouldn't turn down a game...

After two plays so far here are my thoughts: GOOD --components and artwork are great, modular boards for variation are nice, easy to teach, quick to play.  BAD -- to me the play of the game seems rather flat.  Too many turns there really aren't decisions to be made.  You have no control whatsoever over which kind of terrain you get to place your pieces on (unlike Hacienda which you can purchase different terrians and have a hand to choose from each turn); whatever single card you draw, that's what you have to work with.  I do enjoy many lighter games, but I want much more control over my destiny than this game gives.  I'll probably keep this game for a while since I have a 6 year old who likes to play it, and there aren't that many Euro games that a 6 year old can play with the family.

After playing this 5 times at bgg.con 2011, my appreciation for the design has grown a bit. Yes, there is a high luck factor, given that your options are limited to the drawing of one card. However, the extra action tokens that are gathered really make for some interesting strategic and tactical decisions, and the very short play time makes the relatively high luck factor more than tolerable. This game may vie for best gateway game title.

This is another great from the designer of Dominion. Kingdom Builder has more strategy than Dominion, and thus less approachable than Dominion. It has quite a bit of strategy that you discover after you play the game a couple of times. It is a little gem that I hope it will become popular so we can see some expansions!

[url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/107529/kingdom-builder]Kingdom Builder[/url] has some much variables (in the objectives, in the draw of the cards, even in the composition of the board) and a game ends so fast (under 30 minutes), that is hard to make a proper evaluation of it. The game is basically a blur of fast putting of little settlements in the board then, caput, all is done. It took about eleven card draws for the match to finish and the end scoring issues.

In your turn what you do is:

- Draw a card (that shows in which type of area in the board you can put your 3 settlements);
- Put the settlements in the terrain showing in the card;
- Use the ability of one or more tokens you have (these you can take from the board after placing settlements adjacent to a port, to a city, and so forth);
- Pass the turn to the next player.

The game ends when a player is out of settlements (then play continues until all the players have the same number of turns). The scoring happens accordingly a set of objectives.

From what I read here in BGG, [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/107529/kingdom-builder]Kingdom Builder[/url] only start to truly shines after a plethora of plays, because then its details and tatics became more apparent. This might be true, and since a match is fast and the rules are so in the light side, I won't mind playing it more times to find out.

But, for now, my impression of the game is that it has no shine other than the beautiful components. I didn't find anything to make [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/107529/kingdom-builder]Kingdom Builder[/url] better than, say, [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/34219/biblios]Biblios[/url], [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5782/coloretto]Coloretto[/url] or [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/56692/parade]Parade[/url], to name a few fillers that shares the same niche (fast playtime, easy to teach, good to great replayability) that I like better and are cheaper to buy.

Despite the rather weak title, this is a terrific little game. Yes, there's luck involved but the game offers so much more. How else can I explain that I lose so frequently? It's a game about planning, but more often than not, the draw of the card will shift these plans across a changing but beautiful landscape.

now played 4 times.  and while i am beginning to see that there IS a neat game there, i won't be buying this one because:

1 - too steep a learning curve for new players (my group is mostly non-gamers).  this seems to contradict some of the other opinions i have read here, but the debate around "is it really any good?" i think are explained by this learning curve.

2 - i think it really would shine if/when you play it often (thinking here of the interaction between the scoring cards and the powers)

3 - i have other games that i need to play more often that do similar things - sort of.  Ticket to Ride/Settlers/Catan for new players (if that is your thinking about KB); Through the Desert, Dominion, etc. for a more complex, fast game.

gave it a fair shot.

Lackluster is the only way to describe this game.  I didn't really want it in the first place, but the wife thought it looked really good and I had already made some purchases of my own.  As expected, it's level of strategy is minimal.  However, it does play quickly, and it get's most of it's rating due to that.  If you are in need of a game that is easy to learn and quick to play, but still feels like a higher end strategy game, then pick this one up.  You won't play it a lot though.

Maybe it's because we choose the rule "take 1 card per turn" rather than "take 2 and keep 1 per turn", other wise there may be more strategy. In the first game, I was doing so bad and placed last.

RATING: 3
An underwhelming game. The artwork is boring, especially the map tiles, which are lackluster and look rather random. Speaking of the map tiles: when you use hexes in the first place, it doesn't make mich sense to use four big rectangular board tiles for any given game. This makes the setup much more repetitive than the hexes would have allowed it to be. 

Mechanically, you have very little influence on where to put your markers - the game makes most decisions for you. You can't really follow some sort of strategy; the game is much too random and leaves too little to the player. With relatively few turns in a game, the chances are high that you end up with an unbalanced terrain selection. The ways in which to interact with other players are minimal.

It's unclear what the little wooden houses are supposed to represent, or what any of the scoring conditions are meant to translate to in real world terms (why do knights want long lines of houses, along one specific angle of the board? Fishermen are happy to have a house on the shore, but a house on the water doesn't count for fishing?). The theme of the game could just as well be something else, or be totally abstract; the theme and the rules have nothing to do with each other.

If this was an iphone app for 0,79 EUR, it'd be okay. As a boardgame, it's boring.

A very easy game to pick up and play multiple rounds of. The game has a decent amount of variety making each session unique and adding to great replay-ability. The game does lack in any sort of player interaction. Without many ways to direct your own placements actions or those of others the game does seem quite auto pilot to the end. That said I feel this game is a better fit for people who don't want to be overwhelmed by strategy or intense decision making. A fine game to kill time for an hour or so.

At the start of my first play I felt that my success would almost completely depend on the luck of the draw. It felt crazy that the game lets you draw, and then play only a single card - leaving you only the choice of the exact building spot. But then it became apparent that the meat of the game is exactly in that choice of your building site, because it determines your freedom of placement in future turns. In addition to that, the special action tiles combine with your mandatory actions and the scoring cards in an interesting way, making each game feel very different. Brilliant! Now I think that Kingdom Builder is an interesting family game that is quick to explain and play. There is still a chance that you will play a game in which the cards you get make it impossible to claim victory, but that does not happen often once you know how to make the best of your moves. I do feel that it plays best with the maximum number of players, but it is still great with just two.
UPDATE: The game's weakspot is definitely its replayability. After about ten games (in a short time frame), it was losing its appeal for me. This was fixed with the Nomad expansion and the two mini expansions, so for me these are pretty essential.

Not all that bad a game contrary to the naysayers out there. Heck, I like it more than Dominion. I agree that the game is simple and sometimes the strategy appears straight forward, but the choices are valid and can be excruciating if players are jostling for position and fighting to cover the same terrain given the scoring conditions. Some of the tile sets and scoring options appear to be more challenging and more "gamer-friend". For example, both the paddock and barn can alter movement of settlements to increase the options for expansion. Some of the scoring card such as horizontal and vertical scoring also adds a unique twist to conventional scoring. All said, while this game is not Le Havre or Agricola, it is a worthy SDJ winner given the audience. While the rules are simple, there are decisions to be made each move. Vaccarino is not my favorite designer by a long shot, but he is certainly the king of modular board game design. Kingdom Builder is a game designed for expansions, not unlike Dominion. By adding more boards with unique locations or just by adding scoring cards, you will have a completely new game. I generally reject expansions, in favor of a new game but I believe Kingdom Builder expansions will really enrich the gaming experience.

Thoughts after one play: I like it OK. I don't mind the simplicity or the pick a card and play it -game play. Actually that part of the game is simple and elegant. Different scoring cards give nice variety in game play. 

However, the bonus action tokens system, I did not liked too much. They are powerful but bring along quite a bit of AP possibilities (and this should be played as filler to shine). I would have preferred some other system for the special powers. I can see skilled players winning most Of the time because they know how to use them better - possibly even to a point that newbie stands no change against skilled player? (which is not possibly the preferable thing in sdj winner)

This one is a lesson in humility.  Had a very bad first play in which the game basically played me.  Kept drawing the same type of card each turn for the largest type space on the board.  I was basically stuck through almost the entire game.  Went on to bash the game repeatedly for that.

Egg.  Meet face.  Have played in many many times now, both in person and on the iPad.  This is an ingenious somewhat abstract Euro that's easy to learn, plays fast, light strategy, tactical, and tons of replayability.  Wouldn't call it a favorite, but it's a damn good game.

[i]Plays include Nomads, Crossroads, Capitols*, Caves*. [/i]

We got hooked to Kingdom Builder. So much that I’ve bought expansions 1, 2 and 3 all at once because I firmly believe that we will enjoy this game in the forthcoming years. *Capitols and Caves are Deluxified Wooden pieces ;)

The reason we like it so much is because the rules are simple, yet the conditions change every play. It’s not the most beautiful but not that ugly either. 
And it’s short: half an hour so we mostly play two games back to back. 

Upgraded from 8 to 9. Upgraded from 9 to 10. Can’t stop playing!

I enjoy this game quite a bit. It's easy to learn, quick to play, and genuinely promotes experimentation. My group often tries to use Kingdom Builder as a 20 minute game to break up play sessions of much longer games, but we often forget our other game and play Kingdom Builder over and over. I have seen people criticize it for being luck based, which I think is a little ridiculous. Unless you are sitting at home playing 9 Men's Morris, Chess, or Risk every night, most games rely on some element of luck. Carcassonne, a much loved game, uses the same draw-and-play mechanic. The game is fun, and will continue to get consistent use from me and my friends.

Played 2 player.  I think this will be better with 3 or 4.  It felt light, but at the same time it was hard to  make decisions.  I got killed in both games, so clearly mine weren't very good.  I'm hoping game acclimation is behind me, and more fun ahead. 

Edit:  It's grown on me.  It just fills a certain niche. It's quick and light but has some depth. It's repayable.

Edit again:  Put me in the "this is an awesome game" camp.  I like the expansions a lot.  I keep thinking I'm terrible at this game.. and then I play someone that isn't Brody, and I feel ok again.  Moral - don't play Brody too often, he is retarded good at this. (note: I love me some Vasel, but he's wrong about this one when he says there's too much luck in it.  if that's true, Brody is the luckiest son of a gun on the planet.)

Too lazy to design a Euro for yourself?  Play Kingdom Builder!  You're guaranteed to get some sort of themeless mishmash of Euro mechanics.  It's like you're playing a real game, but without distractions like theme or mechanical cohesion.

At its heart, this is a tile-laying game, although the tiles are replaced by small houses in this iteration.  The core mechanics are rather staid, and the variation brought by the other mechanics is mostly in how the game is scored.  This is another entrant in the 30 minute throwaway game genre that is becoming increasingly crowded.  I don't doubt it will have it's place in certain households, but I don't care for it at all.

RATING: 6
Rated after 6 games. Feels like a good game, most likely has potential, but needs to be played more. The game itself is simple, but variety in the scoring might keep this one living for a long time. But this game needs players, who know the rules and the game and can play it fast. Otherwise this game is too thin, there is not enough content or satisfaction available, if the game lasts close to an hour.

I was not convinced after first four plays, but two two-player games made me feel better. Could be best with two players, when the downtime is minimal.

Played again after three years, this time with Nomads expansion and five players. It still feels a bit dry and downtime is quite big. Of course you can plan on others' turns, but others might ruin your plans. Might be "too easy" with two, but I don't know. I can play in the future, but not with newbies. Dropped the rating from 7 to 6 to better match my current rating scale.

Another five player play: Too much downtime, but I slowly start to understand why this game is so much liked. Also, I start to like this game as well.

Pretty fun game. Base game feels overly simplistic. But then again it is built for 8 year olds to be able to play. The key is doing all of your building according to the 3 gold cards you start the game with. The person who does this can crush those who are just building haphazardly.

A really nice medium weight game.  It sort of feels a bit like Through the Desert with more options.  Play is quick, easy to pick up and understand, also quick and engaging.  It is more than a filler, less than a heavy game.  Fun game!

PERMANENT PLACE IN COLLECTION

UPDATE: Risen from 7.5 to 10 with repeat plays. This is a modern classic. It doesn't grip on first play, but my love for it has grown over time. It's a lovely deceptively simple semi-abstract, a worthy successor and possible improvement over Knizia classic Through the Desert. Let's say Through the Desert with special powers. Truly brilliant.

RATING: 8
I like the concept: Carcassone-like gateway game with replayability like Dominion.

But i found one card in hand is too restrictive. So i tried two cards. I like it better but the problem now is it’s too easy to score high, almost perfect even. Later i tried two cards only at the start of the game, and i think this is the best option.

This game is leaving my collection, but i would gladly take the big box edition if there is good deal available.

Fantastic light intro game. Perfect weight and play time for non/new gamers. Enough strategy for seasoned gamers. I thought one card would make the game feel like choices were limited but I never felt that way. Easy to learn and to teach. Great art and components. Tons of different scoring cards and boards make an almost endless possibly or replayability. Very solid game!

I can see why this game would appeal to family gamers -- it's light, with just enough thinking involved to keep it from being a mindless affair, and it has the tri-directional random setup that will keep the game variable and fresh -- but it just seems like a solidly mediocre game to me.  It's not one that I would hesitate to play if someone else suggested it -- it plays quickly and has some choices to make -- but I'm a little surprised that it won the Spiel des Jahres.

Well, no, I guess I'm not.

In Kingdom Builder, the players create their own kingdoms by skillfully building their settlements, aiming to earn the most gold at the end of the game.
\13\\13\
Nine different kinds of terrain are on the variable game board, including locations and castles. During his turn, a player plays his terrain card and builds three settlements on three hexes of this kind. If possible, a new settlement must be built next to one of that player’s existing settlements. When building next to a location, the player may seize an extra action tile that he may use from his next turn on. These extra actions allow extraordinary actions such as moving your settlements.
\13\\13\
By building next to a castle, the player will earn gold at the end of the game, but the most gold will be earned by meeting the conditions of the three Kingdom Builder cards; these three cards (from a total of ten in the game) specify the conditions that must be met in order to earn the much-desired gold, such as earning gold for your settlements built next to water hexes or having the majority of settlements in a sector of the board.
\13\\13\
Each game, players will use a random set of Kingdom Builder cards (3 of 10), special actions (4 of 8), and terrain sectors to build the map (4 of 8), ensuring you won't play the same game twice!

At first I thought this was terrible. I still don't think it is even in the neighborhood of Dominion and as a follow up design I'd have to say it's a disappointment. Yet, as I've played it more I have warmed up to it. Don't get me wrong, there is no game in my collection I would bump to play kingdom Builder instead...but I have found that the flip a card, place a piece puzzle is pretty relaxing.

I guess what I am saying is that it's a good game for tea and conversation, so if somebody asks I'm happy to play.

RATING: 8
This reminds me a lot of Through the Desert, with two key (positive) distinctions: the path to victory is explicitly different each game, and more importantly, even playing with 3 does not have the kingmaker problem TTD can have.

I suspect my rating will rise with more plays, since I also rated Dominion an 8 originally (now a high 9), and while this has very little in common with Dominion aside from the name on the box, it is similar in one key area: a random subset of the components are used for each game. I appreciated Dominion more once I saw how the different combinations of cards work, and I wouldn't be at all surprised if the same happens here.

One potential issue, however. During my first game, I misunderstood 3 key concepts about placement rules. As a result, I made 3 fairly sizable mistakes with my inital placements. I adapted my play style, and I did come in last, but only 4 points behind the first place player. This makes me wonder if the game is too balanced, as I certainly felt like I should've been much farther behind.

It would seem that Mr.Vaccarino has the magic touch these days. Excellent lightweight area control/network creation game. Extremely easy to learn, this game will appeal to new comers and players who haven't played board games before. Due to the variable victory conditions, replayability is very high. Plays equally well with two, three or four players without bogging down. For those of us with children and very little time in our hands this can be played with your significant other in less than 30 minutes.

The first few turns have a massive effect on the rest of the game. A couple of the scoring rules are boring or tedious. Otherwise a very short and satisfying game that stands up to multiple plays.

This is not the spatial euro you're looking for....

Well, at least it isn't for me. Attika blows it away, for one. KB does do a few good things (it's short and punchy, and easy to set up and get going), but it's much less variable than it appears (the special actions aren't really all that distinct, and the variable maps are just there to prevent study, not to generate important distinctions in terrain). Which leaves the scoring cards, and they provided ten, which is too few by at least half.

As for the gameplay itself, it's just okay. The heuristics seem clear: leave yourself options, get 2 or 3 powers, work the scoring cards. I don't think luck is such a huge factor (and I certainly wouldn't want to play with a hand of cards or some no-luck variant), but it does seem like too many moves are obvious or forced. It's also very front-loaded, which is neither good nor bad in itself, but it sucks when you set yourself up for a 4/5 chance of a good draw (actually higher, usually, because of your t1 draw) and get screwed on t2.

I strongly suspect that, just as with Dominion, I'm going to like this game much more after a few expansions come out and give it legs. It's just an expensive proposition, and it's frustrating that it feels so truncated out of the gate.

Got it as a present. I like the game. The first game i thought its all about luck, drawing the right cards. The more you play the game, you discover that you have a lot of influence where to place your buildings. You have to alter your strategy every game, depending on the goals drawn at the beginning of the game. Based on this fact every game feels different.

The game is easily explained to new players and dont last to long. Only the price is much too high.

I backed this game on Kickstarter (the big box edition) and then asked someone in my game group to bring it along so I could decide whether or not I wanted to keep it. After playing it once, I realized that while I [b]do[/b] enjoy this game, I don't enjoy it enough to have it in my collection. 

I like the changing scoring conditions, the different maps, and, therefore, the changing abilities. I also really like the play time—45 minutes for a four player game is realistic. However, the game is essentially an abstract game and I'd much rather play a game that tells a story and/or has a narrative. 

I'll [i]mostly[/i] happily play this game when it gets brought out, but I don't need to own it.

Very abstract euro in many regards-- and I intend that as a good thing. The specific board and victory conditions change each game but the players know the victory conditions before play starts and of course can see the board from the git-go. The idea is simple and well implemented.

Apart from one key mistake, I'd have won my first game but even not winning it was fun and interesting. Although I don't intend to go out and buy the game, I'd likely get a copy I happened across.

Lightweight, quick game.  First night we played this, we read the rules, did the setup, and were playing within 15 minutes.  Played another right after that.  Mostly an area control game, but with the added twist of different and random goals each game.  For example, there's a goal to achieve points by placing settlements in a horizontal line.  The rules are simple enough for casual gamers, so it makes a good gateway game, but the strategy is challenging enough for experienced gamers.  Even with 4 players it should play in less than an hour.  Downside is that it's an abstract game with little theme.  Upside is the replayability due to the random goals and modular board, and the interesting strategies that result.

The hype for this game got completely out of control (Donald X. OMG!) and there's been a lot of negativity and disappointment from people since then, but this game is good for what it truly is:   a fairly simple light filler game.

There aren't a ton of decision to make each turn but there are still enough to keep things interesting.   Drawing just a single card each turn can tend to make the game feel like it's playing itself, but once you get control of a few of the action tiles your options can open up considerably (especially the movement ones).


Gameplay aside, the components are very nice and I love the modular boards.  The way the special abilities are tied to specific boards helps with replayability because you can make a different combination each time, and putting the scoring track on the back side of all of the boards means it will always be available no matter which ones you're actually using.

While this game may not make it into the regular rotation, it's always still enjoyable to play.

Extremely easy to learn, huge replayability and exactly the right depth so you will need to do some thinking without the risk of burning your brain. A perfect gateway game. Love it!  Part of the game is trying to play in a way that tries to minimize the damage bad card draws can do. In this point it feels a bit like playing Backgammon.

If Backgammon seems like a mindless luckfest to you and you  can't deal with the randomness that the card draws can bring here, then surely this isn't a game for you.

The game is decent. It is simple with basic strategy, but mostly the luck of the draw. This game can be compared to Catan and Ticket to Ride. You draw a terrain card, and that's where you play.

The cards can really mess you over. The other players can really mess you over, too.

I would recommend for younger players because it is simplistic. As for replay value, there's not much.

Pick it up while it's on a sale.

I think this game gets a undeserved bad rap, the common complaint about the game playing you instead of you playing the game becouse of the small number of choices is missleading as all hell. The scarcity of options means that you have to plan and play better since you can't as easily make course changes later on.

Really like this one. Not frustrating to lose due to randomness, but the best player will still win the most games. Managed to set it up, play it and clean it up again in 15 minutes :)

I bought this as a gift for a good friend who introduced me to Dominion, a game we both cherish.  After the first game, the four of us playing were certain we'd played it wrong or missed something critical given the snooze-fest that it was.  We quickly broke out a new set of tiles, scoured the rulebook for misplays, and setup a new game.

Nope.  It is what it is - an overrated 2012 spiel des jahres winner.  Very few decisions to be made, linear, with little to no player interaction.  The friend I gifted this game to drew 4 desert cards in a row, pretty much losing the game before it even started.  

That's what I get for blind buying based on designer name and game honors alone.  Lesson learned!  :(

Great game to get kids into the board-game experience. Easy to play and every game is different, which makes for great replay value as the strategies needed to win are determined by the scoring types chosen at random for each game. I enjoy a game or two of this and the ever changing nature of it means you would have to play it a great deal to be bored of it. Games don't drag on for too long either so kids don't get fed up waiting for everyone else to do their turns.

RATING: 6.5
It's light and semi-random but quite enjoyable. The different scoring cards combined with locations really ups the replayability. I don't mind the card draw because you can position yourself to reduce the hurt from random pulls. People get in your way a bit more at 3+ players which makes things interesting.

I will be watching this one closely for expansions. Some interactive locations (barracks?) and funky scoring cards (no settlements in a sector?) could really give this some life. I probably wouldn't bother with new terrain, just some boards with locations and new scoring cards.

Little too light, no desire to really play the game. I think the Nomads expansion would fix it up a little bit but I didn't really want to sink the money into it anyway. 

Traded for Castles of Burgundy. The iOS version does look pretty good, waiting for price drop. It's a good game for that I think.

Very light game that seems to have no decision making at first: you draw a card and place your houses accordingly. But once you get to know the game there is some strategy to it and you can form a lot of tactics. 
However, the theme is very thin and there are many games where the decisions you have to make are much more fun.

In the realm of Carcassonne, draw 1 and play it to place for points type game, but cards and game boards instead of workers and tiles... this plays faster than Carc and is a bit more linear, but it has expansions just like Carc that give it more legs... good solid quick easy game...

Kingdom Builder has loads of replayability due to its varied scoring methods; each game is scored differently. Without this mechanic, the game wouldn't have many meaningful decisions. Kingdom Builder seems to work best as a short filler, but that requires players' willingness to refrain from over-thinking. Analysis Paralysis makes this game overly long and tedious.

This game have some of the same problems as many other eurogames(Settlers of Catan and Atlantis etc.) and that is, if you have an unlucky start, you are pretty much out of the game. Bad game

An odd game. Was perhaps expecting something 'heavier' and the first play was VERY disappointing. We stuck with it, and really enjoy it at this point. Interaction is low, but the game is speedy. Great opener for our game nights, but not something our people tend to want to play more than once a session.

This is a fantastic game, very simple mechanics to it.  But once you get playing it has a surprising amount of depth and replay ability.   There is a bit of luck involved with the terrain card you draw, but you can mitigate that with your play and use of specials.

This one, is a real family game. Easy to explain (within 10 minutes), easy to understand. Not too deep, but some tactics in it. The luck involved in this game is in the drawing of the terrain cards. The theming is nice, although in my opinion, the design of the canyon and the flower tiles didn’t work out very well. This game is all about getting in the way of eachother. The more players get in the way of eachother, the more interesting this game becomes, when it comes to tactics. Fun with 4, but with 2? Well, we have to try it out once. For now, we think it’s way overpriced for the things that you get. The advantage is that the publisher is Queen Games. A publisher that is known for dumping their games on the market after 1 or 2 years. So maybe this one is in the stores next year for less then ½ the price.

Played at the FLGS tonight and was pleasantly surprised.  Not enough to own a copy, but I wouldn't run in horror from the table if someone suggested it.  Has the benefit of playing VERY quickly as the mechanics force a great many of your moves.  The key to the game appears to be controlling your expansion so you don't get roped into programmed placement.

I'd call this "entry level area control" sort of.

Pörgős, könnyed stratégiai játék, könnyű szabályrendszerrel, magas újrajátszhatósági faktorral. Fontos a jó kombinációs készség (Minden játékban a 3 Kingdom kártya jó felhasználása). Egyedüli negatívum: néha az ember beragad és totál lecsökkennek a lépéslehetőségei, így nem tud értékes pontokat gyűjteni. Év játékának kikiáltani elég erős.:shake: Kezdő stratégáknak ajánlott.

Megvettem. A várakozásoknak megfelelően kettesben - és hárman - is jó, nagy összecsapások mennek, jókat játszunk vele.

I prefer more complex, longer-lasting games, as they tend to provide more fulfillment than lighter ones, but I've found that Kingdom Builder offers a satisfying game experience.  It's simple and easy to teach, but it's still fun and will likely serve as a great gateway game for my non-gaming friends and family.

UPDATE: If you've only played the game once or twice and feel that it is too light, I encourage you to stick with it.  It's one of those games that improves with repeated plays.  Admittedly, though, it does play better with a lower player count.

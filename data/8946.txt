{2 plays, 3 player & 4 player} Okay, I didn't expect to enjoy this one as much as I did since it's a *light* deduction game (which didn't seem possible) and it has an endgame "flaw" in that once all the information is out, a player can guess (usually a 50-50 chance) the win... and if not, the next player has it.  But... it was just FUN.  I mean, it's a light deduction game!  And it takes, like, maybe 15 minutes to play.  How cool is that?

Deduction games are a big favorite of mine, and Coda is a good one! Figure out your opponents 4 (usually 5 or more tiles by game end!) numbered tiles by eliminating other tiles by your clever deductive powers. :) My GF's 10 year old is ringer at this, winning all 3 games against us.

Not bad, actually a mini-hit in my family - my 8 year old son enjoys it, and my non-gaming wife is quite good at it.  Plays fast, in fact too fast for any serious deduction work generally.  I've noticed that at least for three player games it comes down to a 50/50 guess by one player - if they are right they win, and if not the next player does.

Coda, pompously dubbed «Da Vinci Code» to gain from the homonymous book and movie but sharing none with either, is nothing more than a modest game: although sometimes guessing which tiles the opponents are hiding could be a moderately fun yet lazy pastime, it’s still too little to make a full game or even a filler out of it.

Great fun if you're not easily frustrated by the "luck of the draw" factor or games that come down to a 50/50 guess - guess right and you win, guess wrong and you lose.  I've only played the two player version, though.  I think it might be (slightly) less lucky and more skillful with three or four.  Great for kids, though.

RATING: 5.5
Da Vinci Code is a nice little deduction game, but there is a big chunk of luck involved compared to many other deduction games! On the other hand, Da Vinci Code plays much faster than games in the similar vein like Sleuth and Code 777, and I guess the low difficulty and higher luck factor makes it a better family game; my family did enjoy it, but that was probably because they won! 

I haven’t played with the “?”-tiles yet; yes, they probably make the game more fun as it increases the difficulty, but it also gives the player in possession of one or both of these tiles a big advantage as the opponents will have a much harder task cracking that code! I will try to add the in my next few plays and see how it goes. It’s a plus that the tiles are sturdy, so it’s one of the few games (along with Hive) you can bring to the beach etc.!

This is a delightful little game. A great combo of deduction, bluffing and a bit of luck thrown in....all mixed in a tight package with a short playing time. As a filler it serves the role well. The player elimination is not an issue, since games are so short. Occasionally, its in everyone's best interest to pick on one player and eliminate them, but again, its so short that even if you're out first the game is nearly over by that point. 

I guess technically, you could get eliminated without receiving a turn. That would stink....but is not likly. Whoever receives the dashes to start with seems to have a pretty significant advantage.

RATING: 5
Components: Functional tiles, number-wise, but a bit difficult to shuffle, and they are prone to flipping over, which is a big deal in this game. They could be spruced up with some nice, abstract artwork. And ideally there would be some reminder (on the tiles or as a player aid) that dark tiles go to the left of light tiles; it can be revelatory if a player hesitates before inserting a tile into their code.

Experience: Simple, mildly entertaining deduction game. Lots of luck, but a fast process of elimination. It's interesting how there is a bit of strategy to this, in that if I know a specific tile of someone else's code, I don't necessarily want to expose it, because it also exposes something about mine. And depending on the tile I've drawn (and assuming I've guessed a tile correctly), I might choose to be defensive and strengthen my code, rather than go for the kill. And even though we gang up on one person's code, getting down to just one tile isn't necessarily a losing position.

We play with the dashes.

A simple deduction game where players have to reveal other player's codes, while keeping their own hidden.  On your turn you extend your code by one, then attempt to guess a piece of another player's code.  If you are correct, you can continue to guess, otherwise you reveal your drawn piece.  Part deduction, part guesswork, plays very quickly and very easy to teach.

UPDATE: Every time I played this game, I knocked a point or so off the rating. Got old really fast. I can only hope the people I traded it to enjoyed it more than I did.

This is an interesting little multiplayer deduction game. Unfortunately, it's sort of falling in the ratings for me, mainly because the beginning is nothing more than blind guessing and by the end it's sort of obvious by the end what the remaining numbers are, unless you're in a "coin flip" dilemma where it's either an 8 or a 9. (I've "won" several times because the previous player guesses wrong on a 50/50 guess -- pretty unfulfilling). 

Traded away.

Played 20+ times. Played 6 times in a row after reading rules. VERY light deduction game, but also very fun. Plays well with 2-4 players and the variant tiles add a little dash to the proceedings! NOTE!!! I have been playing one rule wrong, but I feel it makes for a MUCH BETTER game. The only to change is to OMIT the rule that says you must point to a tile. Instead a player simply asks if the other players has the certain tile. It reduces luck, increases deduction, and reduces some frustration. (Funagain. Traded this and Hera & Zeus for Dominion.) My rating history: 8|7

RATING: 5
The idea behind this simple and intriguing game is great.  Code breaking as a game works perfectly well.  However, I fear that the mix of tiles is not sufficiently large to really challenge strong gamers.    Being the last to play means you have access to a better starting position because you start with more information.  If you pay attention closely enough, you reach a point where you can't go wrong.  We're considering removing 2 random tiles to add to the difficulty, but what I think would make this game shine is just more tiles.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Although at first glance this game may seem a little simple, it's quite challenging when you actually get down to playing.

Game play is simple enough, and fast in the first round, but the later rounds slow considerably when you have to check all the displayed tiles before giving your next 'guess'.

Plays best as a three or four player game. 

Game is quick, leading to many cries of 'just one more game' when being played in our family.

Not-very-interesting deduction game.  Winning is too dependent on lucky guesses timing, not deduction.  Also, the components are irritatingly poorly designed:  the plastic tiles flip up, revealing the number, too easily.

RATING: 6
Extremely simple deduction game that works well as a light filler.  It’s completely unfair because there’s incentive to keep picking on the same player, eliminating them from the game.  And winning can often be the result of having the next turn at the moment when everything comes together.  A test of skill?  Not entirely, but who cares?  The game is over in a few minutes, so lighten up and demand a rematch.

RATING: 6
The game is pretty much driven by luck, as the person who guesses correctly the most number of times is most likely to win. 

The game can also come to a point wherein you have to guess between two numbers, and if you guess correctly, you win, otherwise you lose.

It's worth a try for a few games, but not so much after that. Three to four player games are more exciting but don't really add much value; everything is still based on luck.

A pleasantly light deduction game that's easy enough to be playable at the end of the evening. As in Cluedo and Mastermind you start by making random guesses and hope to convert that to deduction later in the game. Like the above, there's a substantial luck element as a good early guess puts you modestly, but probably decisively ahead. Always play with the advanced rules as the '-' tiles make the game much more interesting.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Quick, and an OK game. A lot of luck, both in the draw and in where you happen to be in turn order once the endgame begins. With more than 2 players, having to remember tiles that you have deduced, but do not wish to reveal (because other players cannot deduce them, and so revealing them gives the other players extra information) is a pain. Tiles have a habit of jumping up so you can see what they are while shuffling, and beware bright sunlight shining through from behind white tiles.

5 - Average game, slightly boring, take it or leave it. This one doesn't do too much for me really. I got it for a very nice price, but was disapointed. I've played it with 2 players and with 4...I just find it much too light and fairly easy really. It isn't terrible, it isn't great, and it fits the 'Geek's definition of a five for me to a 'T'. I may give it to my friend who has much more interest in it than me. Comparitiely, I find Mastermind to be a much better game of deduction.

Unless someone gets really lucky... the first player will almost always win.

Guess a tile in opponent's hand.  If yes, everyone gets to see; if no, take another tile.  If the ones are gone, guess a two; if ones and twos are gone, guess a three.  Where's the strategy?  Everything in this game is random.

Not my cup o' tea.

Gets a BIG '3' from me... and I'd need a LOT of convincing to play again.

While I generally like logic games, this one gave me a real lukewarm impression.  Being fortunate while making blind guesses, and getting 'lucky' in the tiles you draw plays a larger role in the game than what simple deductions there are.

This is a pure deduction game where players randomly draw tiles from two different-colored sets of 0-11, and then attempt to guess what the other players have drawn (guessing wrong forces the player to reveal a number they've drawn).  The game is easy to learn, easy to play, but does require thought even though it can be completed in under 15 minutes.  A great filler game, and a good short game in its own right.  Far, far more enjoyable than other deduction games (*cough*Timbuktu*cough*)

For "light" deduction games, I'd recommend Coda, any of the Scotland Yard series (Ghost Chase is a good one, don't be deceived by the kiddie-theme), Heimlich & Co. Or Inkognito the board game.

Inkognito the Card Game was very disappointing. Mystery of the Abbey is better, but it gets old quick.

I don't remember anything else though, not any awesome moments or something. I guess solving puzzles is just always awesome, whether you got it by luck or actually used your mind to solved it.

Okay, so I just read the rules. I guess it's indeed just fine...? It has a few small details though that I just know I'll need to look up every time I play (like black left to white) and I'm just imagining people asking these over and over again. Also, it's got player elimination.

Fairly uninteresting strategy & gameplay for my tastes. While it is certainly deduction, it is certainly not fun in any stretch of the imagination.

A game where you try to deduce what tiles your opponents hold based on the tiles you currently hold, and that the tiles must be arrange in ascending order from left to right most with only one tile type playing the exception to that generality.

Plays fast (5-10 minutes for two players) and it's a fun mix of deduction and guesswork.  I would like to play a few more rounds to see if there is more strategy than meets the eye, especially with the option after a correct guess of guessing again or drawing another tile to add to your code.  There is definitely some luck with guessing the tiles and in the initial draw, but how much so I'm not certain, but the game is definitely fun.  Update:  Found it at Barnes & Noble of all places for $9.95 under the name "Coda!"

One of the first games I used to introduce my kids to gaming when they were younger.  Perfect game for that.  Emily adored this game and we played many a game together.  Rebecca also enjoyed this but probably not as much as Emily. I had a good time playing this with them.  They are now 13 and 11 so this doesn't get played.  When my neice and nephew are the right age I'm going to bring this out again and infect the next generation on gaming.

Packed away in the kids closet.

Borderline entertaining deduction game. At least it's short. There is a small uncertainty factor in this, which some people can't take. I hate how people who think they're pretty smart start to whine that they lost 'only because they had to make a gamble'. Maybe other players made some good moves, too?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
For children, I'd rate the game 7.5. The concepts required to play properly are too sophisticated for smaller children, and by the time they can consistently order same-number tiles properly etc. they are ready for a great many adult games. Still not bad for the right kid who enjoys puzzle solving.

For adults, it is kind of bland. Requires a little bit of logic, and a little bit of memory, but not enough of either to be really interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Enjoyable, quick-playing light deduction game with a fair dose of luck thrown in. For better or worse, the luck separates it from other "pure" deduction games. I prefer the addition of luck when playing with groups of mixed skills (usually kids).

Because it's so short (about five minutes) and requires good thinking skills, it's a perfect game to use as a warm-up before school.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
[Winning Moves UK 'DaVinci Code' 2004 edition] {Abstract filler; deduction, player elimination; optimal 3-4p} Coda is a fast-paced lightweight deduction game. It's a good game for those who like deduction games such as Cluedo and Mastermind. Once the players mastered its logic of deduction, the deduction becomes trivial. Nevertheless, the player interaction makes each game a little bit different, which makes it a much game than Mastermind: it supports more players, allows more tactics and provides better player interaction. In Coda, every guess is 'bidirectional', one who makes the guess will know more information about the other's hand but he reveals more information about his hand in the same time.

Sometimes, Coda is luck dependent; esp. in the early hand and the random pick from 2 possible numbers. Luck is stronger in 2p game but it becomes less important with 3-4p because other players may not want to eliminate a player too readily. Besides, a decent deduction and mind skill can counter the luck effect.

This is a nice try from first-time designer.  Keep up the good work!

[Variant] The 'dashes' are interesting add-on to the game, though it makes the hand of different unbalanced. Player with the 'dashes' has the upper hand. Nonetheless, it increases the replayability of the game. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
You can try-before-you-buy with a deck of 24 cards A-Q (red)   A-Q (black). Coda is an interesting little diversion, but nothing to get too excited about. A perfect '5'

Update: 05/06/07
Picked up a copy at a hidden  game shop in Duck, NC. I was excited that they had a game I was even mildly interested in. The tiles do add a nice tactile quality to the game. Enough to add 0.67 to my rating.

Played 3+ times. Fun little deduction Filler.  Clever and tense.  In a four player game attacking one opponent may give the other two opponents knowledge of your hand.  **UPDATE**  The first couple guesses are quite random, but once all the tiles are in play the knowledge is usually shared around the table.  The game seems to end in a big rush and ideally you want to share as much information with as many people until you have enough info to win.  I like it.  2005/11/24

The very few great deduction light game. Simple rules, but create clever game play. Excellent components. Playable by adults. Also recommendation for kids to practice on logic deduction.
Generally speaking, fair players use guesses. Good players beat fair players by standard logic. Lucky players beat good players by luck. Strong players beat lucky players by better deduction, observation and risk assessement.
A fun game for 3-4 players. A challenging game for 2-3 players. A very good recommendation to schools.
No need to guess it even if you know what it is.

I highly enjoy playing Coda with Derek. Cannot see any other players who are up for a match with me yet. 

When players complain about disadvantage being the first player, I maintain a more than 50% chance at first guess as a first player. I so far also maintain 100% winning rate in Coda games with winning 3 out of 5 or winning 4 out of 7 rounds settings.

Picked this up for $5.50 in an after Christmas (04) sale.  The rating I gave it doesn't do it justice, but sometimes a game is just "pretty good" in the grand scheme of things and "great" in the right circumstances.

This game is a light deduction game with a fair amount of luck.  What's nice is that, at least for the times I played it, it requires just the right amount of thought for a quick filler.  Sure there is alot of luck involved, but not too much for a filler game.

So far we have only played two player games.  Time and more players may change my opinion.

I don't have much to say about it other than I like the mechanic of having to reveal the tiles when you guess incorrectly (in order to make it easier on your opponent) and add them if you guess correctly (to make it harder for your opponent). This adds a thrilling element to an otherwise simple game. It reminds me a lot of Mastermind, which was a childhood favorite, and I like games that involve both logic + guessing. In fact, logic (or "deduction") games might be my favorite type. Thanks to BF for explaining the end strategy to me... I guess I was a bit slow but I'm catching on. Yay! I really like this game! The LH/RH thing mixes me up sometimes but overall, it's a great game!

Not very good with 2 players, much better with more. This is like the reverse of code 777 where you get to see your numbers and you're trying to guess your opponents. There's really just a lot of luck in this game and not that much strategy as I was hoping after reading the box.

Light deduction game, but I tend to not enjoy deduction as a mechanic - this one seems to have some fairly obvious probability calculations.

A good, simple deduction game.  Plays quick.  Even my 74 yo dad likes it, and he doesn't play games.

Easy to learn, quick game.
Appart from having a code, does not really relate to the book of the same title.

Very fun filler game.  Plays quick with 2 to 4 players.  It is pretty simple, crack the other guys code while protecting your own.  It is a fun little deduction challenge.  Luck plays a significant role but the short play time allows for multiple plays so the luck factor evens out.

Played "Da Vinci Code' variant. Quick, nice abstract game. Good filler game.

OK deduction game with some game elements to think about.  Just doesn't grab me as much as others.

I got this one as a gift and need to get it played sometime this summer.  It is a bit better than I thought.  Basically it seems like a more interactive Mastermind type of a game.  I might be able to use this at school at some point.

After a few turns, you can always win with know-how. But this could be a descent bridge game.

Better deduction game than Sleuth or Mystery of the Abbey, and a lot quicker too (which is good b/c these sorts of games get old quickly).  Nice that it can be played with a few decks of cards too.

Fast, lightweight deduction game. After one playing I found it a bit too simplistic and a bit of a crapshoot. Not as fun as my own game "Liar!".

RATING: 7
After 5+ Plays: Simple concept, clean execution.  The dashes are just plain evil.  Super quick filler with enough thought to keep it interesting.

After 10+ Plays: There are interesting depths to the thinking when you really start to consider what the other player is guessing.  My rating is still based only on the two-player game, and I'm not really interested in trying it with more players.

Guessing-concluding game for 2 to 4 players. Best on 4 as you have to try to think how much your fellow player can deduce from your hint. Cleverly done.

Fun little code solving game.  Better with more people as with 2 the endgame can be way too easy.  Plays quick enough to do multiple games in a row.

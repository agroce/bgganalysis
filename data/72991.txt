Great family games and my boys really like it. Very simple, yet elegant worker placement that uses different color sets of cards to restrict what can and can't be played in certain areas of the board. Will definitely play this one again and I'm sure the kids will be requesting to play this one again soon!

After 5 plays I think it's a darn good game without lots of rules and game play goes fast and smooth.  Most games are very close with my only 3 player game finishing with only 2 points between 1st and 3rd.

RATING: 7.5
A light to medium weight game about building towers with multiple ways to score points.

This game is more than the sum of its parts.  From the description alone, it sounds pretty abstract and mundane.  Gameplay however, is surprisingly good (well not so suprising for me, as I love Kramer games).  The game lasts only four rounds, so it doesn't overstay its welcome, the artwork is fantastic, the ruleset is simple, there are multiple ways to score, and there is a relatively fresh take on the overused "worker placement" mechanic.  

Each round, you are given $20 (money is fairly tight in this game), and a handful of worker/builder cards, which differ by colour only.  Each turn, you place a card on one of several possible locations: there are 4 different building sections, each of which also cost money, which is priced depending on the colour of building piece chosen, there are two other building sites where you pay to look through a stack (one of which is the light tower which breaks ties), there is a straight money location, and an extra action (extra cards) location, as as a starting player location.  And finally the building site location, where you pay money to build a certain amount of building pieces.

You score points when you build your buildings, you score at the end of each round for each tower built, each piece of gold on each tower section (very lucrativbe), and a point is scored for being starting player.  At the end of the game, points are also allocated for: second highest) in each colour, as well as for every $10.  Gameplay is smooth and easy with some room for planning.  A good game that hopefully will be made more widely available.

RATING: 8
A relatively short, enjoyable, well-designed worker placement game that is essentially a "gateway game" in terms of complexity.  The basic hallmark of a good game is one in which players enjoy making the game's decisions, and Asara has enjoyable decisions.

Asara's central mechanic is a variant on the worker placement mechanic.  In fact, somewhat curiously, Asara might be considered a good gateway game for other, more complex, worker placement games. 

In Asara, at the start of each of the four (scoring) rounds, each of the players is dealt 7-9 colored cards.  The goal of the game is to play your cards on the board such that you can acquire the various structural pieces of (thematically attractive) towers - bases, midsections, and tops - then build them in front of you such that at the end of each round, and the end of the game in a grand scoring, you have the most victory points. Roughly speaking, you score points for each built section, each gold decorated section, the tallest towers in each of the five colors, and the greatest number of towers built.  

On a player's turn, the player must play one card from his hand of colored cards by placing the card (as one would a worker in a worker placement game) on an area on the board that immediately provides him with a particular opportunity, action, or reward.  Money is a factor, and money can be tight.  Each action area on the board typically has between 3-6 slots to accept played cards, so this is not a worker placement game wherein each action can only be performed once, by one player, per round.  

But...in accordance with the "innovative twist" in Asara, the first person to play in an action area on the board...sets with this first played card in the area... the color of worker card needed to play in that particular area in future plays. In other words, all future plays in that area must now "follow  suit" or....one is allowed to burn two "not following suit" cards to achieve the action, which as you can imagine, is NOT efficient. 

Thus, Asara, while assuredly modest in theme, provides for interesting worker placement style decisionmaking mixed with a sprinkling of strategic card play, all within a game that should play in about an hour. Nice.

Asara is a simple but fun worker placement game. You use cards as workers to collect tower pieces in order to build those towers and score points each round. There is a set collection in it as well as you try to collect emblems on some of the tower pieces to score extra points. The game is dead simple but fast. This might be one of the best gateways for worker placement type Euros. Even easier than Pillars of the Earth or Stone Age.

Good family game. Easy to explain, playable in less than an hour, enjoyable even for kids since 7 years old.
For adults, it's a classic Kramer-Kiesling game: nice the idea of coloured workers that enhances the timing aspect. 
However, in my 2 plays, i think there are not many deep choices. 
Reading the rulebook, Asara reminds me Coal Baron (that i've played before than this) for some ideas, but when you play it, there's not much Déjà vu sensation.

I really enjoyed my first and only play of Asara.  I wasn't really expecting much as it looked like sort of the same old thing.  Stragely enough, it was sorta the same old thing, but for whatever reason still felt fresh and compelling.  I really liked how players need to "follow suit" within the worker placement mechanic.  The game _is_ a bit fiddly and probably wont change your life, but I thought it was a stand out effort and very much worth the 60-90 minutes it took to play.

An elegant game of building majorities with a clever twist on worker placement. A very clean game where you want to be just ahead of your opponents, but don't want to waste actions by being too far ahead. Workers are cards in a few colours, and the first player to place a worker in one of the many spots on the board sets which colour of workers are allowed to place on that action. Reminded me of the Keyflower colour rule.

Sort of a card game variant on worker placement where you can only place the same kind of worker on a certain action as placed by the player who first took the action. Game is pretty fluent but beside the clever cardplay mechanic it's also rather bland. It's beatifully produced though and the nice components will draw players in. If the players will come back after playing is rather doubtfull. Not the best of Kramer and Kiesling, but still a very nice family game.

During the rules explanation for this game I was feeling completely lost. There are a lot of things going on between the card play, the tower building, and the scoring. Surprisingly once we got a few turns into the game it all made sense. I liked all the different things that you are forced to think about every turn. Planning ahead how you will get money, which towers you will build, how many pieces to build, and then some. I can definitely see how things could get quite competitive with more players (I've only played with 2). I'm not sure if I would like it that way or not, but I'd be willing to try. I do find it quite odd that this game was in the Spiel des Jahres nominee list alongside Qwirkle and Forbidden Island when the rules were much more complex than those simple games. In fact my only reason for not adding this game to my wishlist is the fact that it feels a little too rules-heavy for me to use as a family game.

The card placement restriction is just enough to induce tension, but not enough to make you feel as though you have nothing to do. The tower building is fine, not too complex, maybe a little simple. But, the card play is enough to help this game along. Lighter than I thought, and a little "loose" but a fun game all together. Beautiful components help.

I really don't understand the extremely high ratings.  Played it with two and four players and just felt OK.  "Worker placement with a tiny twist", but everything besides the tiny twist is pretty similar to what you've played before.

Art is great, I won't say it's Vohwinkel's best game that I've seen (that would be Amigo's edition of Midnight Party) but certainly one of them.

I just feel like this game didn't need to exist.  It adds very little new to what came before.  If you never play it, you'd never miss it.

Medium to Light weighted eurogame that gets more tense after each round.

Asara has pretty good ideas like the management of your workers represented with cards of different colors that determine where you can go to work in this round but not in the further round. 

Another game by K&K with the typical "I want to do 3 things but I have to choose 1 of them and probably in my next turn some of the 2 not choosen actions will be ineligible".

The game is beautiful. Every time I open the box I marvel at the nice looking components, brilliantly colorful board, and evocative theme. 

Unfortunately I am not yet sold on the gameplay, though I have only played two-player so far. It just seems that rounds last too long and the color-blocking card mechanic is not strong enough to have a significant impact on your opponent's move. Maybe with repeated plays and/or more players the game will get better but for now I am a little disappointed.

RATING: 5
A very simple set collecting game where you collect your sets via worker placement.

Essentially, you place your workers, collecting a token in the area where you place your worker.  The first worker placed in the area dictates the color of worker that must be placed in that area for the rest of the round.  Most of the time, you'll be collecting tower bases, shafts, and tops, which you'll then build using the build area at some point.

Then, you score a few points each round for your towers, and also score points at the end of the game based on tallest towers of each color, as well as tallest overall tower and most towers built.  Really, everything works exactly as you'd predict a generic Eurogame to work without any twists to make it anything incredibly exciting.

I would recommend it for a family game, and I would certainly be happy to play it in that setting, or in a setting where I wanted to play something casual that didn't require much concentration.

Not a game I enjoy playing, although it's short enough that I'll endure it on occasion.  Board and artwork is very nice.  In general, I'm not a fan of games where you quickly get locked out of many choices.  Seems like you only have a few real options whenever it gets to your turn.  And then racing everyone for the tallest tower in different colors is not really appealing to me.

In this game you try to build towers, with different scoring configurations for the tallest tower of each type, the most towers etc. Essentially a set collection game, which uses a pseudo worker placement mechanic (through the use of changing hand of cards of different colours).

A game revolving around set collection.  Players receive cards (money).  Money is spent by placing cards on the game board, with the first card setting the color for that area of the game board.  Money is used to acquire tower tiles and then to build the tiles into towers.  Points are awarded between rounds and at the end of the game for certain tower features - highest, most, windows, etc.  Attractive game with interesting choices.

Seemed... "ok" on first play. Which is to say, a huge letdown from high expectations of a K&K design. No, we did not play with extra the "professional" rules. But I read them, and they didn't seem like they would make a huge difference. Really no one in my family enjoyed it. And I bought it specifically as a family game. Obviously it's not going to make an appearance at game night. Which means it's kind of a bust. And my kids couldn't get over "you mean I can insert new floors into the building after it's complete???" Made no sense to anyone. And two different tower section types that look different but behave exactly the same just seemed weird. The much smaller Palazzo seems to do a similar thing much better.  Which reminds me, I should bust that out again.

RATING: 6
First impression: Very nice and detailled artwork on board and cards by one of my fav. artists, F. Vohwinkel. The game itself didn't impress me, at least without the two "mini-expansions" (one gives you a chance of another cards, the other helps with the omnipresent ties). Overall, it feels that you don't have much control over your fate as you are dependent on the cards you get. I'm willing to give it a second try, but sadly don't expect a much better game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Frankly, I found this game boring, and will not actively pursue it any further beyond the single play I've gotten out of it. Not because Asara was in any way glaringly bad or disfunctional, but just because there seems to be not much happening: no dramatic build-up of tension, no gambles which may or may not pay off, few long-term options, little player creativity. There simply cannot be many long-term choices as the cards which drive the entire thing are drawn at random from the deck every new round; and how these play out is determined by what your opponents got: which is equally random. Insert obligate 'manage the luck' comments here if you want: perhaps one should, but there are few things to manage it with, to be honest.

In essence this is a very plain majority game where the parts needed for the majorities are collectively bought and assembled using special actions, and scored just once. There is also bit of progressive scoring which can ultimately make up about 25% or so of your point total (and perhaps more), so it should not be ignored, but I've found it to boil down to hoping that the timing of play is such that you get at certain elements earlier than your opponent: there is little else to do.

Once again: Asara is not a bad game in any way, but if you were hoping for a challenge like the one given to you by earlier Kramer & Kiesling games, you will be disappointed. In terms of 'feel' it comes close to the duo's earlier title Australia, or Rüdiger Dorn's Arkadia: solid family titles for people who want a bit more bite, do not shy away from mechanisms which belong in the stable of gamer's games, but without the complexity. Personally, the mechanic of inserting elements between a top and a base reminded me very much of Antoine Bauza's Pocket Rockets; but this little game is all but forgotten already by most people.

The rules for this game are easily explained, but the gameplay is more challenging than you might first expect.  Players dispatch their buyer cards in various colors to acquire pieces of towers, which can then be built and earn prestige points (and even more with the right embellishments).  These buyers can also increase your money, gain you more buyers, etc.

The twist is that each area of the board can only have one color of card, and if you don't have the right color you have to play two other cards.  With a limited hand, that's a real issue. Bonuses are dealt out at the end of the game for the biggest and most towers built.

So easy to learn and fun to play, this is an ideal family game that plays well from 2 - 4 players, but it's certainly tighter and more competitive with 4.

Components: Attractive board, utilizing every inch of space. Cool artwork on the various styles of tower; they each feel quite distinctive. Quality cards; one of the few games where half-sized cards work better than would full-sized cards. The differing heights between windows and middle sections makes it difficult to quickly judge the heights of other towers.

Experience: Immediately fun. The color mechanism is brilliant and incredibly interesting. There are so many possibilities at the beginning of the season, but as the season progresses and each suit gets declared, I must be more and more careful with how I use my cards.

Some of the areas of the board are much better than other areas, but there are several such areas. The window shop is sure to be available for a player in a pinch who can't find any better way to make points.

The influx of cards and cash each season is great, to get me back into the game despite what happened in the previous round.

I dislike the asymmetry between tops and bottoms, and between windows and middle sections, with tops and windows being better than their counterpart, but without a difference in price. There is no reason to buy a middle section over a window except in desperation.

The game length is perfect.

This is a basic, not particularly original area majority game, with towers substituted for areas. You score for adding a section to a tower and then again at the end of the game for building the tallest or second-tallest tower of each color. You also get credit for building the tallest or second-tallest overall tower and for building the most or second-most number of towers. Like most such games, it's better with more than two players.

Lightweight and fun family game. One of the better K&K games if you ask me. Spectacular beautiful board and pieces as well. Simple rules and easy to play. The illuminated windows expansion didn't add much but I would still add it.

Nothing new here, it's a worker placement game with cards instead of meeples. You still have several meaningful choices to make during the game and there is a little bit of race to get the right positions and a little bit of turn angst too. The game is so light that there's no real AP involved despite this. Playable in just over an hour I'd say.

This was my favourite game played at Essen.  I was planning to wait and purchase it once it was released here, but after trying it out, I decided to re-arrange my luggage to fit one more game! I was surprised by how well this scaled to 2 players, it was really fun that way.  The artwork is very nice, and combined with the unusually shaped board it looks impressive when it is all setup.  I love the simple, intuitive ruleset, it is very easy to teach. Another bonus is that downtime between turns is very short, and the game plays fairly quickly.  I think the game is deeper than the simple rules make it seem (especially once the advanced mode is added), but further plays will allow me to judge this better.

Worker placement via card suits to construct segments of towers.  (Don't ask me why).   Points are scored for the tallest towers and also for the highest quantity of towers.  Bonus points are scored for segments with gold "bling" and lighted windows.  It's pretty routine and would be considered a typical middle-of-the-road Euro.  The game takes an inordinate amount of space for some reason.   There are some user interface issues:  The tiles are very thin, and the brown and red tower segments are hard to distinguish.  Player colors are also hard to discern.  I don't expect this to be one of Kramer's greatest hits 5 years from now.

RATING: 8
Kipróbáltuk hárman a játékot, valószínűleg nem ez az ideális létszám, de már így is érzékelhető volt, milyen lehet a játék négyen. Már így is sokszor volt olyan érzése az embernek, hogy melyik ujjamba harapjak. Tipikus munkáslehelyezősnek mondanám, habár ügyesen van megoldva (kártyák=munkások). A színkorlátozás is egy érdekes csavar a mechanizmuson. A téma nem nagy szám, miszerint tornyokat húzunk fel valahol a közel-keleten. Viszont családok között népszerű lehet az egyszerű szabályok miatt. Mi az ajánlást figyelmen kívül hagyva egyből a haladó változattal kezdtük, s egy abszolút kezdő is simán vette az akadályt és jól érezte magát a játék közben. Ügyesen kell lavírozni, hogy a különböző kihívásoknak megfeleljünk. Miszerint minél több tornyunk legyen, minél magasabbak és minél értékesebbek és ha még egy-két ablak is világít, akkor már esélyünk van a játék megnyerésére. Ami nem is a legfontosabb, hanem a játék maga, ahogyan látjuk fejlődésünk évről évre, s annak ellenére, hogy próbálnak keresztbe tenni, mégis sikerül végrehajtani a terveinket. A játék nem túl hosszú, főleg ha már megismertük, akár egy, másfél óra alatt is lejátszható. Családoknak ajánlott kategória. (2014.12.21.)

Hm. Felmerült a Palazzo is, mint hasonlóság, de annál sokkal jobb: ugyan a hasonlóság adott: tornyokat /a palazzok helyett/ kell építeni, és a méret és a darab szám számít. Ugyanakkor sokkal több helyen, módon, kisegítő opciókkal, s ennek ellenére gyors: 1 órás játék 4 fővel. Ahogy elnéztük, még van lehetőség újabb kiegeket kiadni hozzá (van még 3 sarok :-)): és valszeg megérné, sokkal mélyebbé lehetne tenni a jelenleg a családi játék kategóriájú játékot. Az első kiegje is jobbá teszi. Szóval szép, van benne fantázia, lehetőség, még lehetne tovább fejleszteni, van benne potenciál.

A no frills convert resources to majorities game. It's pretty fast and tight. Looking back on it, it reminds me of a (slightly) more complicated and better version of Manhattan.

This is an exellent game, completely underrated.  It's a worker placement game in which you have to follow suit.  Instead of meeples you use cards.  It also has some elements of area control when you evaluate your towers. Very beautiful components.  Easy to understand and straight forward.  You don't have to refer to the rulebook every turn.

Nice enough game however the gold emblems scoring EVERY round is a little strong if you manage to build them very early.

Being able to pay to hunt for the specific piece you want takes a lot of the strategy out of the game.

The random cards for workers is a nice and a quite unique mechanic, but as first player being able to get two extra cards for free is very powerful.

RATING: 8
Solid family game with interesting choices in timing and card play. I would go with the Profi version of the game except for absolute non-gamers.

The whole tower building and 1st 2nd majority scoring is familiar ground.

The way you use your cards, the use of colour suites, the limited options and resources, the buying of the start marker, the extra points from gold ornament, all this adds up to light but entertaining choices. Players quickly see where the best gain is, and getting there first or better, getting in a colour they can't spend first is crucial. So often in playing, I was cursing because the players to my right did exactly what I wanted to, forcing me to switch my moves elsewhere. 

The theme is pretty enough but yet again it's men with beards holding maps in front of construction yards. heyho.

Solid euro, a steal at around £20/€20.

TH/2011  Essen 2010.  on bruno faidutti's Best List

First Impressions:
Another interlocking puzzle board (instead of foldout), and player screens.  The screens are stable and need to be assembled each game.  I am not sure over time how the screens will stand up to use--I can see the slotted  ends getting bent.

Colors are a little garish for my taste.  Cardboard coins and tokens are of medium weight (sometimes hard to pick up on a flat surface), and they punched out a little roughly.  This game seems a tad-bit off Ravensburger's usual high quality.  I am NOT looking at this going, Oh, yah, a quality game.

Setup is fiddly.

Onward:
Despite my picking apart this game, I really like it.  I will often play a new game again during the first few days, and because I like a break between the same game, I rarely play it back to back, which I did in this case.  Good, solid play, but not a brain burner.

This has shades of a more elaborate Palazzo, a favorite game of mine, where you are buying building levels for structures of the same color (optional in Palazzo), and the number of levels increase the score.

Game is short and fast, with few and simple, well written rules.  There is no reason for play to slog down.  Play should be short and snappy.

Strategy:  First get a base & tower of the same color, then go for the middle sections.  If you don't have both a top & bottom, all pieces of that color can't be used--a costly loss.

Of Note:
I just finished the second game, but both times the player who went first won.  Both times they got the advantage of points in the first round (bribed and picked the white base with gold on their first turn) , raced ahead, and stayed ahead.  The trailing 3 stayed grouped together, and seemed to have no chance to catch the leader.  Hopefully this is a coincidence, and will have to see what happens in future games.

I did rate this at 7.5, but reducing to 7 until I see how often someone other than the first player wins.

Beautiful board and components.  Simple enough gameplay to make this a great family game.

It's effectively a worker placement game but this is achieved by placing cards into fixed positions on the board.  The action is taken immediately.

These actions typically involve taking one or building several sections of a coloured tower.  Money can also be picked up via the card placement actions.

Overall I really like this game.  It plays quickly at around 60 minutes so leaves plenty of time for other games in an evening.

RATING: 5
In Asara players collect sets of tower blocks, trying to build the highest, most beautiful, or simply the majority of towers. The actions required to do so are claimed by playing cards in one of a number of locations. The colour of the first card played in an area also locks the colour for that location; all further cards played into this area this turn need to be of the same colour.

This rule demands a bit of hand management and timing your actions correctly can be a delicate affair,  but ultimately you are very much at the mercy of the cards drawn by both you and your fellow players. Options to mitigate draws of the wrong colour are scarce, and there is little room for pursuing different goals.

In the end, Asara is a light family game which initially looks a bit more mechanically complex than it really is.

Frustrating that about half the moves other players make inadvertently screw you over. I'd prefer a design where I could form a plan and achieve it, rather than just feed on the scraps left by others. You can do a little bit to help yourself, but then it seems to be player chaos. Probably alright for families with 10-12 year olds.

 A beautiful game with several tried and true mechanisms. I find the hand management aspect especially engaging.  If you have a "long suit" how do you use it to make it tough on your opponent.

Asara is a set collection game with a twist in its "trump suit" style of worker placement. When placing workers, the first worker there defines the color. Only workers of that color or two of any can be placed in that location on future turns. The feel is unique and thoughtful, but not over burdening. A light game, Asara is best with three or four but feels too loose with two. Strategies are friendly. Players can even add to their collected sets (towers) after they have been scored. The trump suit mechanic is the best Asara offers. The game is solid and well done, but a bit too loose. A lack of tension makes for less reward when a plan goes right. Everyone's plans seems to go right and the winner is whoever went the "most" right.

RATING: 7
After one two-player game: agreeable little (although you have a lot of components and quite a setup) game, but lacks a little "je ne sais quoi" to make it really thrilling. 
Maybe better with more (although it is clearly written on the box that it is good with  2…)

Edit: yes, much better with 4 players.
Rating: 6 with 2, 7 with 4.
They really shouldn’t write on the box that it is recommended with 2: it may help the sales, but not the game…

Interesting twist on worker placement, using cards as workers. All cards played in each area must be of the same color, and that makes the game. You really must pay attention to what the other players are doing, both to the cards they are playing and to which towers they are building. Pretty good game, simple and elegant, with some luck of the draw but enough strategy, and beautiful artwork.

JEM magazin 18. szám: http://jemmagazin.hu/magazin/18-2014-szeptember/

Aki kinyitja az Asara dobozát, egy gyönyörű családi játékot fedezhet fel benne. Már a tábla is különleges, az öt négyzet alakú részt puzzle-szerűen rakjuk össze, majd becsúsztatjuk közéjük a háromszögűrészeket. Mindenki kap egy paravánt, ahol pénzét, az Asarit, és megvásárolt toronyrészeit gyűjtheti, és amelyen minden pontozási és vásárlási információ megtalálható. 
Minden táblarész különböző akcióknak ad helyet, ahová segítőinket küldjük majd. Sok más munkáslehelyezős játékkal ellentétben segítőink itt kártyákon zerepelnek, és nem saját választott színünkben kapjuk őket. Az akcióválasztásban sok múlik a szerencsén. Adva van egy  pakli, amely a 45 beszerzőttartalmazza 5 különböző színben. Minden kör – vagyis év – elején minden játékos a játékosszámtól függően 7, 8 vagy 9 kártyát kap a kezébe. Ezeket a beszerzőket küldhetjük el az akcióhelyekre, de mindenhová csak azonosszínű beszerzők mehetnek. Tehát ha valaki letesz egypiros beszerzőt például a bank épületére, a következő játékos csak akkor tehet oda, ha van piros beszerzője,vagy beáldoz két bármilyen kártyát, pedig abból így is elég kevés van. 
A fő akciók természetesen a tornyok részeinek beszerzését teszik lehetővé. Ötféle tornyot építhetünk: barnát, zöldet, pirosat, feketét és fehéret, amelyek árban és pontértékben is egyre drágábbak. Külön helyen vásárolhatjuk meg a tornyok alapját, csúcsát, törzsét és ablakrészét, az ár mindig aszíntől függ. Egyes elemeken aranydíszítés is található, amely külön pontot ér.

Ha elegendő – vagy a lehetőségekhez mérten néhány – toronyrészt sikerült megvásárolnunk, azokat  megépíthetjük az építési területre küldve beszerzőnket. Itt 1-től 7-ig választhatunk, hogy mennyi részt akarunk/tudunk felépíteni. Az árát, vagyis annyi Asarit, ahány darabot építünk, kifizetjük, majd kitehetjük paravánunk mögül a tornyokat egy egyszerű, bár építészetileg elég furcsa szabályt követve. Csak olyan torony tehető ki, amelynek van alapja és csúcsa is, viszont a magasságát bármikor lehet később is növelni törzsek és ablakok beépítésével, a tető alá. Minden leépített toronyrész azonnal 1 pontot hoz, és mind a négy kör végén értékeljük a tornyokat.
A banknál három akcióhelyen 12, 10, illetve 8 Asarit szerezhet a beszerzőnk. A negyedik helyen bármilyen színű kártyával bárki bármennyiszer 5 Asarit kaphat.
Ha a Kémek házába küldjük be szerzőnket, akkor a megvesztegetés után (3 vagy 5 Asari) átnézhetjük valamelyik toronyrészpaklit, és kiválaszthatjuk
belőle a nekünk tetszőt – persze a toronyrész árát ekkor is ki kell fizetni a megvesztegetési összegen felül. A Kalifa pártfogása nagyon hálás mező, hiszen a lapka birtokosa lesz a kezdőjátékos, és a kör végén 1 pontot is kap. A kezdőjátékos szerepe nagyon fontos, ugyanis ő indítja el a kártyák lerakását, a legfontosabb helyeken ő határozza meg, milyen színű kártyákat lehet oda lehelyezni.
Ha mindenki letette az összes kártyáját, véget ér az év, azaz a kör. Ilyenkor értékelés következik: mindenki annyi pontot kap, ahány tornya van  plusz minden aranydíszítés is egy pontot ér.  

A játék a negyedik kör után véget ér. Az év végi értékelés után egy végső értékelés következik, ahol mindig az első két helyezett kap pontot minden színnél.Iletve a legtöbb tornyot és a legmagasabb tornyot leépítő játékos. 
Az alapjátékhoz csomagoltak két kiegészítőt Az egyik helyen plusz kártyákhoz juthatunk a beszerzőtoborzás A kivilágított ablakok háza főleg 3 vagy 4 játékosnál nyújthat segítséget. A megszerzett lapka egy már meglévő,
ugyanolyan színű ablakra építhető rá, így a torony magasságát nem növeli, viszont úgy működik, mint az aranydíszek, vagyis plusz pontokat ad, és döntetlen esetén is erősebb lesz a másik toronynál. 

A játék hangulatos, gyors, magával ragadó,az egyik kedvencem. A könnyed,de tervezést igénylő játékmenetet kissé befolyásolja a kártyák véletlenszerű kiosztása, és a játékostársak által mindig (nekünk) rossz helyre letett
kártyák is némi bosszúságra adhatnak okot, de némi újratervezés után, ha figyelünk, hogy ne fogyjunk ki a pénzből, mindig találunk egy másik megoldást.

Tower building game over several rounds. To score points during the game, your tower needs to have "bling" (shiny ornaments) and numerous towers.

The pseudo interesting thing is to do the action of a space, you must play a card there. If someone has already played, you must match color or use two cards. Each round you start with a hand of 7 cards, so matching color is very important/helpful to being able to take more actions.

At the end of the game, there is an additional score for tallest tower of each color, tallest tower overall, most towers made (1st and 2nd).

Susan's game which she taught Nasia and I. Very pretty game with resource management (cards and money) and simple points scoring.  Later Peter bought it but it sat on his shelves for several years.  Now we play it as a short to medium length game.

RATING: 6
Asara has a curiously old fashioned feel these days. This was how games used to be, about ten years ago: strong restraint on your actions, score for every kind of majority at the end. Essentially this is a worker placement game, but your workers come in five different colours. Once a worker has been placed in an area of the board, you need to match its colour when placing there yourself, or sacrifice two cards as a wild. Problem is, your workers are randomly dealt, so having the right worker can be a matter of luck. Another problem is that some tower pieces are decorated and score an extra point, but these bonus points form a significant part of your score. Again, availability is random. This game really is about picking the cherries first, but you don't know to what extent you're disadvantaging your opponents by doing so. Kramer and Kiesling won't ever be my favourite designers, but this isn't their best work.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A pleasant little game with beautiful art, Asara is about building towers.  Players can buy towers from different areas on the board and compete to have the most sections of each color.  On the whole, it is a little light for my taste, but it's a very good example of what it is. (1 play)

Un juego con un tablero modular bastante llamativo pero temáticamente muy pobre. Se intenta construir y hacerse de las mejores torres del reino con bases, troncos y faros. Al final se dan puntos por todo y el que se halla hecho con la mayor cantidad de puntos gana el juego.

First off, the board is BEAUTIFUL, very nice job by FV and I REALLY don’t give a rats ass about such things but the colours on the board are fantastic and I just had to mention this.  

The game is pretty good too I thought. K&K team up and put out a good middle weight, a good mix of tactics and strategy overall, VERY quick turns so no AP and the game was a decent length for a middle weight too about 60 - 90 minutes with 3 players.

At its heart set collecting and Kramer while NOT including his usual 'dirt' here (although there are some 'races' and if your paying attention ways to snub people) he did include one of his other trade marks, lots of way to score. Might be a bit on the lighter side of Middle and the rules are fairly simple.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (February 2012)

As I respect the Kiesling/Kramer duo a lot, I was expecting a lot from Asara. Sadly (along with Tikal II) I was deeply disappointed. The game is way too light, I felt no tension whatsoever and the decisions are obvious. 

Like Tikal II, its redeeming factor are the gorgeous production values.

For now, I won’t play again this game although there is a caveat. I played only a 3 player game, perhaps this need 4 players to be enjoyable. Perhaps it is a good game to bring new players to the hobby, or as a familiar game. A lot of  better worker placement games out there.

While not exactly earth-shatteringly innovative, Asara still manages to feel like a well designed game. The collect and build mechanic is not anything you haven't seen before and the placement of buyer cards is interesting, but not entirely unique. Despite that, Asara does everything well and the sum total is a game that, while not breaking any new ground, is still good fun to play - which, ultimately, is far more important.

The most innovative thing about Asara might be that cards are used in form of workers. Other than that, Asara is a solid short majority game with low to medium complexity. It is mostly tactical in that players have to gain majorities efficiently while not losing sight of intermediate scorings. Thematically, it bugs me that built towers can be heightened subsequently by adding further stories in the middle. This already felt odd in Palazzo and Comuni, it doesn't get better by repeating it here.
When the big rating purge takes place, Asara will be a prime candidate for a 5 rating being as average as average can be. For now, I still enjoy average games enough to give at least a 6.

Ravensburger doesn't do deep euro brain burners and this is no exception.  But they generally publish quality games with smart gameplay for a large audience.  This is exactly what Asara is.  Light and fast, easily accessible and playable with family while maintaining a nice level of planning, management and thinking.  If you like "Blue Moon City", this really feels like a strictly superior option for the same "slot".  It's currently nominated for a Spiel and certainly deserves it (seeing how the main Spiel often favors more accessible games over more complex entries).  Obviously it's lighter than what I usually fancy, but there's certainly room for a game of this quality and it plays fast which makes it less of a dent in a "serious" gaming night.  Finally, I rarely notice or care for visuals, but the art on this is really good and looking at the little towers as they are built really works.

Played the basic version twice, with three and then four players. 

It's a light fast game; Building towers. The rules are simple to master, but the winning strategy is not so obvious. The game components look great. 
Explanation of the rules included, it took a 4-player game under 45 minutes to complete.

I think that a four player game is just slightly more fun, as you're able to block each other more.

I'd definitely like to play the full version, as I think it would make it more interesting.

Asara didn't do it for my wife and I as a two-player game. It felt too much of "you get this, I get that, you get this, I get that". That and trading the first-player token. It always meant first player got 2 money spots, and the second player just had the choice of the second or the third. It became a tit-for-tat game that wasn't very interesting.

It's a shame because the game seemed OK otherwise. If it had some way to chain two actions together, then maybe it would have been more interesting for two players. As it is, it's headed for the trade pile.

Juego de colocación de trabajadores que usa en vez de marcadores de madera (meeples)  usa cartas de color . Consiste en comprar las partes de una torre y construir la torre mas larga, primero que los demás. Requiere de estrategia y suerte, ya que depende del  color de la primera carta ubicada en cada sección, la opción de comprar la parte que se necesita . Si no se tiene la carta del color se puede cambiar por dos cartas de colores diferentes (lo que es costoso), ya que se esta sacrificando alguna otra sección. Confrontacional, (ya que el primero que llega tiene las mejores posibilidades de conseguir bloquear a los demás) Sencillo de armar, rápido de jugar. Buen diseño gráfico.

Sumptous, opulent even. It's a rare occasion when I feel that the graphics of a game are a bit overdone, but Asara might qualify - after all, the lovingly executed different towers of Asara, although they immediately make me dream of elven woodland cities, vigilant borderland keeps or the abodes of evil wizard kings, are only used as coloured building blocks within the actual game.

Kind of a letdown, but even if Asara is a very simple game, it feels like a good one, too, mainly due to the strength of the action card system, an ingenious twist on worker placement: with the first card placed in a given action section, you determine the permitted card colour for all players, which introduces a lot of tension while still being very quick and intuitive. Everything else is by-the-numbers majority scoring and therefore poses no danger of outshining this central core of Asara.

Play cards, actually workers, in certain areas and get building pieces for the towers. In each area you can only play cards of one colour. So the first player to place a card in that area decides for the others which colour card has to be played there in the remainder of the round. Good turnangst. The game suits families, rules are simple, but there seems to be enough in it to keep gamers interested as well.

RATING: 6.5
Amazing art work, excellent use of set collection and follow suit worker placement but a bit dry.

Each turn you send one of your workers to town in form of coloured cards to collect parts of towers. You then score points on building them highest, most, colours etc. played in 3 rounds, towers are hidden until 'built', building early scores more points but lets your opponents know what you have.

Solid middle-/middle-light weight Euro -- using colored cards (a la Ticket To Ride) to active various roles which in turn give you the option to spend/get currency, building components, etc.  Area of control-like scoring -- several rounds, and you score after each one for how many towers you have.  Well produced and pleasing to the eye -- once explained, the concepts come together well.  Nothing very new, however -- many existing concepts rolled in to one.  Can be fun every once in a while, but not something that will become very popular.

Brilliant light to medium game that is easy to learn, quick to play, but rewarding in its mechanisms and choices. In these regards, a lot like the great Seeland. The modular "expansions" built into the game mean you can play it from very light to dead on medium. Pick and choose them to suit players and play time. I think plays best with all of them.

RATING: 6
A surprisingly enjoyable game that seems to avoid the analysis paralysis typical of other K&K games. Of course, I seem to like their games the first time I play them and then lose interest in them after another play or two. But this one's still in its honeymoon period. Getting gold ornaments seems to be a pretty strong strategy, essentially doubling the productivity of any given action/purchase, so I can see there being some luck in how these tiles pop up relative to the turn order. However, as this is a relatively quick "family" game, there's no crime in that. I'll play this one again.

[b]Update:[/b] Second play confirms feel. Nothing wows me, but this is still a solid way to pass 45 minutes. Decent.

I found playing this strangely unsatisfying. It may just come down to how I play these types of Euros, but I found playing Asara just as stressful as playing a heavier worker placement game like Agricola or Caylus and yet with little of the rewarding feeling you get from those games (partly because of how chaotic Asara is, partly due to Asara's lightweight status and partly due to how much closed information there is).

A neat blend of worker placement and trick-taking. The theme is one of the most boring ever though. I'd take just about any theme over building towers. Still, I'd rather play this any day over Firenze, the other major tower-building game out there. I enjoy Asara, but it's not flashy enough to stand out from the crowded genre of worker placement, unfortunately. Plus the fact that 90% of your points are scored at the end is a big turn-off. The trick-taking element saves it for me though.

RATING: 6.8
I absolutely love this game's simplified form of worker placement in which colored cards serve as your workers and set the type of workers that other players can use in a given space. What I'm less enthusiastic about is the fact that all of the placement is in the service of a simple majority building mechanism in which players try to construct towers of various colors. Having bonuses for most windows/tallest building/most buildings helps a tiny bit, but I wish the end goals were a bit more differentiated.

Quick-moving worker placement game about building the biggest/most phalluses. There's a strong card game feel. Between this and Stone Age you have two solid gateways into the genre. But nothing in this game struck me as a new thing that would excite me to play again. No, not even the phalluses.

typical, but lighter Kramer-Kiesling fare and thankfully there is not much AP here. nothing, that I have not seen though. it is a well-crafted sub 2 hour game. use cards to get money, get more cards, buy building parts, build towers or change first player. buildings score after each of 4 game turns and tower majorities score at game end.

--- Preliminary thoughts ---

Beautiful game with many paths, possibilities and decisions, but they are don't seem to be meaty ones, but rather obvious ones.

I have the impression that the most important thing is being lucky enough not to be blocked by others, or depriven of the tiles you want, or having the tiles you need appear.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very basic tower building majority tug-of-war with a surprisingly large table footprint. The blocking worker placement scheme is quite interesting but not enough to compensate for the dull scoring. Also creates a need to constantly keep count of tiles bought, which means a rather large memory element.

整體機制挺簡單的
策略點主要是前期搶金色的塔標記跟蓋小塔
出牌時則想多做的行動要先搶跟放你手上顏色多一樣的牌
遊戲最後的塔高計分蠻多的
可能才是爭取的重點
稍嫌單調了點
可能體驗過就差不多了
規則:
*圖板先擺好周圍方型照分數軌擺，四個角落使用對應面(進階或基本)，將對應建築板塊洗勻放在對應位置並開滿該圖板上空位(15個紅背的窗戶板塊放一旁，進階規則使用對應板塊面放上面)，放回合標記
*每人放一個計分在0分，最近爬塔起始並拿對應標記，起始金額依序遞增20/21/22/23元，並拿屏幕，前隱藏，45卡牌洗勻2/3/4人發9/8/7張
*每人輪流進行直到牌出完，該回合結束，每輪有兩個動作
1.放牌到對應板塊上(左邊開始放)，要跟之前在上面的同色，或是出任意兩張(銀行 建築圈 市場區域除外)
2.執行該板塊動作
>買塔板塊 開著的買一塊，價格看顏色
>放數字幾格的建築區就可以蓋出幾格塔，也要付對應金額拿對應分數，可少蓋，塔可加在中間，但不能互換，行動完後面前的塔要完成(有底跟頂)
>放卡拿錢 5元格沒有放置卡片上限，放銀行卡不用同色
>賄絡 付錢可拿任意一疊塔板塊挑一塊付錢買(不能買開的)
>搶起始
*一回合結束時，每個塔一分，塔上金色裝飾一分，起始標記一分
*下回合開始前，所有卡牌重新洗勻在發對應張數，市場空格補滿，每人發20元，回合標誌前進一格，起始標誌玩家開始新回合
*遊戲結束先算回合結束記分在進入最後記分，不同顏色塔最高跟次高拿分(白12/6黑10/5紅8/4綠6/3棕4/2)，全場最高跟次高塔拿8/4分，最多跟次多塔拿12/6分，每10元1分(平手加總除人數，無條件進位)
**進階規則**
>多買牌動作，付錢抽兩張牌
>開燈房動作 付4元抽3取1或10元抽5取2，沒拿的置底，該板塊可蓋在自己塔的中間層上，每回合計分也有1分，最後一分平手的話打破平手
**禮物擴充**
*把禮物標記放在對應格，當有人放牌在該格時拿走該禮物並執行，每回合結束都會補充，蓋在之前沒拿走的上面(使用進階燈塔規則的話，多放一張在燈塔格)
**瓶中精靈**
對應格放卡時付錢，可執行除起始玩家以外的所有行動選1，不管有沒有人使用過

Standard worker placement Euro of collecting pieces to build towers over 4 rounds. Each round will score you little points for each tower built and some bonuses for pieces with chrome on it. Game end will see you score big points for biggest tower in each of the 5 colours, biggest overall, most towers, blah blah blah, etc. This one does introduce a restrictive element on what you can go for, in that you get a hand of 7 cards, and each time you take something from one of the tower collection sites (tower base, window, turret, middle tower piece), you place a card. But each player after the first must place the same colour, and if you don't have it, you have to place any 2 cards instead, making for 1 less turn for you this turn. So that's an interesting wibble. Each colour costs a different amount of money to buy, so there's decisions on whether to go for cheap or expensive towers. There are other spots where you can spend your cards to get more money, get more cards, buy tower beacons for bonus points, look through a tile deck and take one, be first player and of course, build your towers. It's pleasant enough and moves along fast. But it's just another standard game off the production line that we've seen many times before.

This is my "intro to worker placement" game of choice!  It's another Kiesling/Kramer homerun.  You have a hand of different colored cards and use the cards as your workers.  You place them on the board at the different action spots.  Once a color has been laid down at a location, that determines which color of card must be placed there that round in order to use that action.  Smooth mechanics and timely choices make this great.  And of course I love building the towers with the tiles!  Love it!

A very distinct looking family game with the "new" mechanic: "card-placement". I like this game very much. It is easy enough to be played by families and complex enough to fit the taste for me as gamers-game loving. The towerbuilding itself reminds me of "Campanile". Very nice game. My rating will very much likely rise.

This is a tile drafting game where you "pay" for tiles in various markets using randomly-drawn colored cards.  Once someone pays in a market using a certain color, subsequent cards in that market must be the same color.  You're collecting and playing tower-piece tiles, and trying to establish the largest of each color tower by the game end, as well as the largest overall tower and most towers.  I found the game a little too simplistic for my tastes, particularly for the amount of set-up in the game.  It's enjoyable, but there's really not a lot of depth--maybe they're targeting the SdJ crowd.

Worker placement, with a twist. Placing the workers requires paying attention to the previously played color in a particular area. This makes order of play important, and makes you consider your own placement of workers, so you set yourself up to be able to play in particular areas while preventing your opponents from doing the same. This type of direct confrontation may not fit all player types.
The scoring method is relatively straight forward, but it will certainly benefit people that keep count of all the pieces as they are played. I would have to say this one does not feel as complex as "Stone Age", but it feels a bit higher in complexity than "Pillars of the Earth".

This is a quick playing, color matching tower building game. The rules for building the different towers are very similar to the boat building rules of Shipyard and Nauticus. Much of the game is dependent on the different color cards you draw each round. Once an area is associated with a color, each spot in that area can only be used with cards of the same color, or two cards which become wild. This leads to some intrigue and pressure about not knowing what will be available and how, but ultimately while I enjoyed the game, it didn't have much depth.

I like the card-playing mechanic, but find the rest of the game a little underwhelming.  The scoring is a bit counter-intuitive in some ways, and puts a big premium on getting the "gold" pieces.  A little weird also (at least in a real-world architecture sense) that you can make a *completed* tower (i.e., with a top piece) taller.

Inoffensive, but there are several other games of similar weight that I enjoy more.

Component Quality:
Thick boards and excellent art work throughout. My favorite part is seeing all the different towers being built in front of each player. I recommend sleeving the cards, as they will get shuffled multiple times per game.

Gameplay:
A much lighter and faster game than I expected. Turns go by with little downtime. The late rounds can be prone to small amounts of analysis paralysis as you start to find ways to trump other player's plans. That sounds pretty cutthroat, but really this game has enough luck involved that it stays pretty light-hearted. A solid game overall.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I found it to be a simple game and not very exciting or endearing. The mechanics are fairly basic with nothing much original to add. I've only played it 2 player and personally found it slightly boring. I'm sure 4 player would be much better due to increased competition for resources. The complexity can be scaled slightly so might be good as a kids game too. The theme and artwork though are really nice. Very nice looking play board and it's a big board too.

RATING: 7
Fun and Fiddly.  Requires a large table and some patience, as initial setup and between round setup is cumbersome.  3 players seems to strike the balance of being tight without being crippling.  Hidden information isn't really hidden, as memorizing critical opponent tiles is easy.  Criticism aside, the joy of making progress carries the day.

Pleasant game of set collection. The hook is the Worker placement mechanism, each player is dealt a hand of card from a deck with five different colours. To take an action on one area you must follow colour if you are not the first in the area. Creates a nice tension between getting the stuff you want quickly and making optimal use of your hand.

RATING: 8
Pretty good family game with a sharp edge. You have to carefully plan ahead and especially make sure you don't get shut out of the tower building. Timing is very important, which I always like. It's already good with with two, but becomes a lot more cutthroat with more. I was a bit surprised by its nomination for the SdJ, as it's not that friendly as most family games.

Already a 'five' for me, would definitely like more plays.

This is a great lighter mid-weight game!  It's an excellent balance between tactical actions and long-term strategic planning.  It's an excellent contender for the Spiel, and it's completely clear how it earned it's nomination.  The end of year portion of the game seems to make only a small difference in points, but even with the huge influx of points at the end of the game, those small difference will probably make the difference between winning and coming in second.  This is part of the games appeal, the decision-tension remains high throughout the game, as every decision is important. Dnt underestimate the Caliph's favor as that 1 point boost, early game is significant, and the ability to get first choice of placement the following round can also be improtant--but it is gambling since you won't knonw til the tiles are revealed.

Only played 4 player games so far.

This is a very solid set collection game using a worker placement/action drafting mechanic. 

I like the twist on action drafting that forces you to match a card suit lead in each area where you want to draft. You can always play two cards as a wild but this severely lowers your efficiency. 

It has just enough going on within a very reasonable playing time. 

For some reason though the amount of moving parts is often too much for me with this one. It sometimes feels like a chore to play it.

Fun and interesting game. My son described as a "worker-placement Alhambra" which is pretty close. The scoring at the end is similar to Alhambra with points for tallest and second tallest tower in each colour with some colours more valuable (and more expensive)than others. Worker placement because you place out buyers and there are limited number of places at each market which is even more restricted since you have to "follow suit" unless you sacrifice an extra buyer. I think there are several strategies that we will see more as we play more.

RATING: 3
I only thought Asara was okay.  The game limits your actions based on the number of cards you get, but also the colors of cards that you receive as well.  So someone playing into an action you have to take hinders your ability to take more actions in that turn.  Some actions seemed much more important than others, for everyone, so a person playing first into those has a distinct advantage, and getting hosed out of those because you don't want to play two cards can be hard to swallow.

It was alright, but not something I had much fun with, diversity in towers seemed inferior to just concentrating on one or two of the big pointers and building them up into monster towers.

All that being said, the game is very pretty. Still, it won't see much play from me.

Tower building, somewhat like Palazzo, the card matching mechanics work well with some "escapes" when you can't match. Seemed uneven while playing it, but the final score was a 3-way of 4 for first. Maybe a bit over complex for what it is. A little Alhambra-ish in scoring

I liked this quite a bit ... fairly simple rules, as might be expected from a Ravensburger game, but some difficult decisions and enough to keep serious gamers interested and involved. The board and bits are very nice, and the completed towers look great, as well. Really needs tbe "advanced" game to shine, and I'm hoping the expansions the designers have mentioned are packaged together and made widely available. I'm glad Rio Grande Games is picking this one up ... the English-speaking world lost out when Ravensburger's excellent Diamond's Club (looks like Ravensburger is doing one semi-complex game in a square box annually now) wasn't produced in English. Asara is definitely a pleasant surprise for me (as Ravensburger games often are more family-oriented than geared toward gamers) and definitely worth a try.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Asara is a reasonable family game with a beautiful presentation and a lot to do, but not much semblence of control.  With so many scoring opportunities, the experience feels diffuse and there is almost no opportunity to ding your opponents.  It's close to multiplayer solitaire.  Rumor has it that there are some Master's Rules (typical for the designers) and it might improve with those.  The fundamentals are all here, but the tension is not.

It seems silly that the smaller middle pieces have the same value as the taller middle pieces - the taller middle pieces will make your tower taller!

This is a Kramer/Kiesling game that I had never heard of before. Apparently it's not gotten a lot of note and is flying under the radar.

It's a game where get a hand of cards which you spend to get tower parts, extra cards, money and also to build towers. You have to play to the appropriate area to do the associated action, and once a card has been played in any area, then that area is color-locked to that card color. You can get around this by playing any two cards as a wild in that color. Once areas are filled up, no one else can do that action in the round.

The game is four rounds and each round you get points for each tower you have built and all the shiny bling on built towers. At the end of the game there are payouts for highest tower in each color, highest tower overall and most towers. Some colors are more expensive to build and payout more points for highest in that color.

This game feels a lot like a simpler version of Shipyard to me. It's a game that I think could play well with both gamers and family. I liked the game a lot and after playing it I immediately snapped it up in a no-ship auction for a pretty good price.

The card-driven mechanic and tower building theme work very well together.

Compete with your fellow players for the most beautiful towers. Players take on the roles of famous architects and using their chicanery, try to obtain the best construction parts. With these the exuberant towers are erected. Think ahead, use your tactical sense and it will help you to stay ahead of the other players and thereby become the greatest architect of the country. Exciting construction entertainment for the whole family.

Pleasant family game that I really do not need to own, because it feels like so many other games in my collection. There is some nice turn angst, but the luck of the draw and the relative (rather than absolute) value of your towers make for a game with only light decisions. In its category, I would rather play Pillars or Diamond Club, because of a greater emphasis on action selection instead of hand management. Artwork is nice, components could have been better.

A mid to light Kramer and Kiesling tower building game. Players compete to build progressively taller towers of different colors during the four rounds of game play. Scores are calculated based on the height and color of each tower built as well as bonus points for player that built the most number of towers. Certain elements within the towers such as decorative motifs and windows also serve to score extra points.

Nothing particularly special about this game which allows players to buy tower components based on following the color and suit placed by the initial buyer. This raises a certain amount of tension in the decision-making process since only a certain amount of slots per tower segment is available for purchase in each round. Again, nothing spectacular about this game, just a basic bread and butter Euro game. Not Kramer and Kiesling's finest. For that game, look at Java.

Simple hand management/quasi worker placement game, where you buy tower pieces off the board, and attempt to build the biggest, most plentiful towers you can. Points are awarded based on how many you build, who has the highest in each of the 5 colours, and so forth.

It's a light game, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. The main mechanic is that players must follow suit, ie if I use blue cards to buy a roof tile, then all other players must play blue cards to buy roofs. Or, they must play 2 cards to function as a wild, using up valuable cards and getting less actions. This leads to a decent amount of think time, do I use this card now to establish this area as this colour, do I save this card for that area, should I build now to make sure I can build this turn, etc.

There's no way I could go past the wonderful colour palate of Asara, plus as a worker placement game, it's not as tight as the heavier, longer and more intricate titles in my collection.

It is kinda a hand management game. There can be 9 areas available. Once a card has been played in an area, only that color card (or 2 other cards for one) may be played in that area. You are trying to build beautiful tall towers. The base, top, and multiple center pieces are bought in the various area. Then you have to be able to build them. It is quite a challenge. Seemed very different to me.

The components are even better in person than in the pictures.  The cards are quite nice but the lovely towers really take the show here.  Of course all those little tiles all over are a bit fiddly and give the game an even larger footprint than the huge board would make you expect.  It does play nice and fast but the setup and cleanup kind of take away from this being a quick game overall...

The game itself is a pleasant lighter Euro.  Its fairly easy to do whatever you want on a turn but the limits on your money resource and what tower pieces are available make you have to manage every turn carefully to maximize your buildings.  Add on top the clever suit following mechanic for your workers and you can get some surprisingly hard choices on some turns.

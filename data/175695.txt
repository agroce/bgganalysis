A cute idea with poor execution. Regular tiles are not arranged with any normal grouping, and when tiles do come out the order is thus random so it's not possible to construct an economy or predict anything. If that's your jam though, perhaps?

Initial Impressions:
-----------------------
I always say I am not really a fan of tile laying games, but lately I am starting to enjoy some of the ones coming out of Japan.  This is a neat civ building tile laying tableau game that is super tense!  Basically you do actions until everyone passes each round, but as soon as 1 person passes, you have to keep paying back to the supply money to keep going (and money is really tight).  The end game was a little too crazy, and it did sour the game a bit for me, but this is one I am most definitely interested in playing again soon.  The graphic design on this one leaves a lot to be desired, and if someone brings this over, I really hope it gets a major overhaul graphics wise.

Employing the spatial tile mechanics of Glen More, the game is one of my anticipated games in 2016.  However, the player orders ruined the game at the very initial stage.  $1 is definitely cannot be sufficient to compensate the player ordering effects. The tiles appearing in different  stage are very unpredictable. I had a very frustrating experience, perhaps I was just unlucky to be the last player without wood. The fact that it is so dependent upon player orders left me wanting a game with more tactics.

The interesting and innovative element of Minerva is the limited number of tile activations that you get per round, and the placement geometry to make the most out of the tile draws and the activation themselves. This is a very good game that works well at all player counts and demands several plays to discover optimal spatial arrangements. There is a fine art at activating early enough to speed up growth, but not too early to limit it, and this is a form of tension I really enjoyed. 

I find the components and art charming and perfectly serviceable. This is a game crying for expansions to add variety and freshness. Not groundbreaking, but a job very well done.

I picked this up while I was traveling in Japan and was delighted to find an excellent game hiding inside. While it certainly is another game about laying tiles to build a city the unique activation/scoring mechanics elevate this game significantly.

That said, my wife and I have only played a single 2-player game - I'll need to play some more to see how it stands up over extended repeat plays.

Minerva is a fascinating game. In mechanic it is reminiscent of Glen Moore in the way that tiles on your tableau are triggered according to their geography.

In Minerva you buy tiles or you trigger tiles on your tableau. You can only trigger them in rows and columns and so the placement of the original tile is vital. This spatial puzzle working alongside an engine building tableau makes for a really strong game. It was so good we immediately played again after the first game. The way tiles come out is very variable and so no two games will be alike.

Whilst it is true that you are building your own city tableau, there is interaction in the race for the tiles as well as trying to be ahead in military compared to your fellow-players and the race for scoring tiles.

Minerva punches a lot of game into its 60 minutes and I can't wait to play this one some more.

Played a full 3P game today, ended 54VPs, 51Vps, 48Vps and we all made small tactical errors. Once you get a hang of the icons and meanings/restrictions of certain actions, it plays out very smartly. I like it a lot. I repeat, I would mark it higher except it is multi-player solitaire.

++++

I enjoyed the game but mark it down slightly as it is a multi-player solitaire. You each build your own city, the only inter-action being deciding to buy a tile someone else might want first. Other than that, it's a solid engine builder, with familiar ideas nicely packaged. Once you understand the icons, and the way resources are triggered, it opens up. But it's still a multi-player solitaire.

Production is nice. As usually with JPgames, the icons are too small, but the backgrounds and colours are co-ordinated, so it matters less. The rule book seems long, but there's some repitition and for gamers, it's meat and drink. Nothing to trouble you.

It plays as a solitaire too, so I'll give that a try. I liked it. I liked the way you needed to build in lines *and* groups. I liked the way you could trigger both ways and again with assistants. I liked the balance of cost and rewards. All solid stuff.

But it is a multi-player solitaire.

Activate a Row or Column of your buildings.  Start with 9 times you can do this and can buy 5 more activations.  Points only come from: Temples(End Game), Culture(In Game), or military(compare each round, 1st, 2nd, 3rd place VP rewards). All of it works fine but not like Glen More or suburbia tile activation and Santa Maria does the activate a row or column much better with the dice mechanism.  Enjoyed playing it.

RATING: 7
An intelligent tile-laying game of building up a production engine, enabling players to win various races to culture tiles, endgame scoring tiles and gaining a military majority. The necessary trade-offs are interesting: Do I want to win the military majority now or is an assistant for later usage better? Do I spend money to continue playing this round to secure a cultural tile/military majority at the risk of entering the next round empty-handed and leaving good new tiles to the competition?

In hindsight, the game seems better than my actual play experience. Enjoyment suffered from the dry nature and stumbling through the game without creating much synergy in my engine. It didn't help that I needed a few efforts before it finally hit the table. Certainly a game that gets better with repeat plays but not having the right group for this, it left my collection. One of the few games where I might regret this decision if I ever get the chance to learn it better.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I understand why so many people are raving about this one. This was an interesting tile placement game where one has to consider carefully the lines of placement for future activation. I'm thinking one doesn't want to branch out too much in diversity of the different options as focusing on one or two lines for points is likely the way to go? Graphic design may leave a bit to be desired but it doesn't get in the way and the graphical design is pretty clear on defining what a tile costs and what it does. Rules are in Japanese but there is a translation on BGG.

Cool tile laying and activation game. This gives me a taste of Glen More in its emphasis on spatial and limited activations, but feels much more difficult. Maybe that is just my lack of experience. In my first play, every player took a different strategy and I liked the variety that showed. Need to try it a couple more times to determine if it's a keeper, but definitely enjoyed the mechanisms.

I have to say I liked this one more than what I was expecting... I had seen the video from Rahdo and wasn't very excited by this one...

I really liked the mechanic of the variable round "length", in setup you make 6 piles of regular tiles (with the same number of tiles) and in each pile you put one Round tile, then you shuffle each pile individually and stack them on top of each other, then you take tiles from the top of the pile until the Round tile is drawn and that's the tiles available for the round (with the ones that were not taken in previous rounds. 

I also like the way you Produce things by placing the Residences and the Assistants... so you really have to think about how best to place the tiles... 

cool game

In theory a solid game, but in practice entirely predictable, with each move more obvious than the last. The round setup, in which next to no new tiles might come out in a round, strikes me as a particularly poor design choice, as it could make the game play out in about half the advertised play time. The building requirements, in which you must build your city in a line in order to activate the most buildings possible at a time both results in goofy looking cities and proves to be not much of an impediment, since you can easily get at least four activation of each tile. Maybe better with more than two?

[b]Minerva[/b] was sold via the marketplace 4/10/17.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]Minerva is another game that I'd compare to Glen More, this time in regards to building a tableau of tiles and then activating them to produce goods and VP. The most interesting mechanism of Minerva are the living quarter tiles which are used to activate a row or column of tiles depending on where it's placed. This drives all the decisions you make in Minerva and creates an interesting spacial puzzle you need to manage. 

Unfortunately the rest of the game is completely predictable. The building powers are typical fare, get basic resources, spend resources for other buildings or VP, build tiles for end game points. Unlike Glen More there aren't any special tiles that change up game play, after a couple of plays you've experienced everything the game has to offer and have very little incentive to keep playing. I also really disliked the random nature that tiles came out, some rounds there weren't any new tiles to buy which felt extremely anticlimactic. Minerva is an okay came that functionally works, but I can't find any reason I'd want to play it over Glen More so it quickly left our collection.[/i]

RATING: 7.5
総評としては面白い。思考性も高く、システムの構造も美しくまとまっており、完成度は高い。特に、勲功を集めようとしている相手に追随・対抗するためにわずか数点のＶＰを奪い合ってリソースを消費すると容易に疲弊を招いてしまう点は、いたずらな軍拡競争が国力を食いつぶす様をよく表しているし、逆に文化方面で対抗すると複数で文化系得点タイルを取り合うために底にある高得点タイルが取りやすくなるなどの点は、競い合うことで文化が昇華していく様をシステムとしてうまく表しており、美しい。

ラウンド中に出現する施設タイルのランダム性にこだわりすぎたためか、タイルのセットアップが複雑で手間がかかり、ややスマートではないように感じた。この手の、「山を数等分してから各山に一枚特別なカードを混ぜ、それをシャッフルしてからから各山を重ね戻し、ある程度の範囲のタイミングでランダム性が発生する」という方式は、シェラマドレのゲーム（バイオスメガファウナのP-T境界面イベント等）ですでに体験していたが、運次第ではゲーム展開を雑にする要素をはらんでいるように思う。このメカニックがゲームの楽しさに寄与しているように感じたことはあまりない。実際今回のプレイでは、１ターン目にわずか２枚施設タイルを引いただけでラウンドタイルが登場してしまい、ゲームの出だしにもかかわらず街づくりのビジョンを描けず、プレイの方針を定められなかった。

施設効果のシナジーと得られるリソース、施設の起動回数の制限などが良くバランスが取れているが、リソースを一回で２つ発生させる施設と、所有している特定リソースの数×２だけ金を発生させる施設などを複数確保されていると、一回のアクションで数十金を生み出され、この集金機関と勲功集めを絡めたプレイヤーは圧倒的点差で勝利した。

This game is a mess. With a full player count, it seems unavoidable to fall into a rut of not being able to afford tiles (and there doesn't appear to be any logic to their resource costs) and you probably will spend most of the game re-activating the same tiles over and over again (ALL tiles are shuffled and simply laid out each round. There is no such thing as an advanced tile, so the end rounds feel identical to the early rounds.)

Basically, Minerva feels like someone took Glen More and shoved it in a blender, then tried to piece together a coherent game using a far less intuitive ruleset. The game is playable, but there are so many better similar games out there, why bother?

Medium light tile laying game where you are building your city of Rome. Unique mechanism of this game is that most of the building you build do not provide any bonus by itself. These buildings must be triggered by building a residential building nearby. The game appears to have fair bit of replayability from randomizing the building a player can build in a round. There seems to be multiple paths to victory too though we need to play more to see how balanced they are. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played once with 4P. I generally like the idea of a spatial element when activating buildings in games. Minerva's take on this is that buildings are activated in a line whenever a residential building tile is placed. It presents a fairly unique challenge to optimise tile arrangements, but what really fleshes the mechanism out is the inclusion of assistants and purple buildings which offer some flexibility in activation.

However, the rest of the game – from the activation effects of most tiles to the majority scoring of glory chips – relies on mechanisms which have been rehashed way too often. Given the relative weight of the game, I just wish the designer pushed for more innovation overall. The graphic design on the tiles, while functional, could also have been more polished.

One last concern in the game I played is that we were short on resource tiles early on. This seems to be a consequence of the way tiles are laid out in the rounds, and those who didn't get access to the resource tiles early were in a difficult spot. However, I will reserve judgment as we were overly conservative in using our residential buildings, so it is possible that there were options out of that sticky situation. That issue notwithstanding, Minerva totally relies on its novel tile activation mechanism as a source of interest; the rest of the game is fairly pedestrian.

solo game: brain burn-y fun!

---
1 play, 2er

Fun, thoughtful tile-laying game with simple rules but quite a bit going on (many different scoring methods, tile effects). It's in the multiplayer solitaire class, with the only real interaction being the taking of tile(s) from the display that someone else wants. The spatial element is different than what I've seen before. Do you build in a long line, hoping for a few big activations? Or in more of a grid, to be able to use the same buildings repeatedly? An interesting challenge!  The money and resources, though, might be a touch TOO tight! Especially with the (almost) completely random setup, it's possible you won't see anything worthwhile or efficient to build at the start of the game (and getting all 5 assistants out could be nothing more than a pipe dream!). 

[b]--- Summary ----[/b]
Setup: shuffle the Round marker tiles into evenly divided groups of game tiles. There are several types, each with a different resource build cost (several basic tiles, free of cost, are always on display at the start), and different production (one of the 4 basic resources, culture or glory for the round, or end-game VP). Reveal tiles, adding them to the display, until the first Round marker is drawn. Also, 5 random temple tiles (end-game VP). In addition, place the culture and glory VP markers nearby (endgame VP). Players start with a Forum tile (produces any single resource when activated). 

Game play: On your turn, you may either build a tile from the display or build one of your 9 residences, or pass. Tiles must be placed orthogonally adjacent to another tile in your personal display. Some tiles have an effect only when placed; most must be activated. When you build a temple, replace it with a new one from the pile. When you place one of your residences, you pick a direction (N/S/E/W); in order, activate all your tiles in that direction from the residence until you reach another residence or the edge of your display. If you generated culture (3 types: theater, art, academics) points, you may spend them to acquire the topmost culture tile of the appropriate type(s). If you pass, you're out for the rest of the round; if your turn would come up, take 1 coin from the bank. If anyone has passed, everyone else must spend 1 coin to take an action.

At the end of the round, in reverse passing order, people may spend glory or coins to buy an assistant (cost escalates as you have more). Assistants can be used in a future turn to reactivate a previously placed residence (max once/residence). Then, reward this round's Glory VP markers to the players with the most remaining glory (tiebreaker = passing order), and return all your glory tokens to the bank. 

The game ends after 6 rounds. In addition to VP from culture and glory tokens previously acquired, score VP for temple tiles (generally based on tiles in the 8 surrounding spaces, or in the rows/columns in the 4 directions from the tile) and for remaining resources/money. Highest sum of VP wins.

RATING: N/A
Very nice small civ game. It has some nice mechanisms and it's really worth the try. Most of the people will enjoy this game as it gives players the opportunity to build a strategy based on the tiles that are bought and allow a few interesting combos.

Managing the residence tiles and the assistants is key.

I only wish that the buildings that are drawn were sorted out in a more controlled way, something like having 6 levels for the 6 rounds making the evolution more visible and the game not too blocked from the beginning, which may happen if only 'big' tiles come out in the first couple of rounds.

The mechanism of running the city is definitely unique. That said, resources are very tight, sometimes frustratingly so. It is often a struggle to afford anything. It also lends itself to AP, as players spend time analyzing the city layout, trying to squeeze out every possible resource or victory point. The theme and art aren't anything special.

My first thought was another Roman family, tile placement, city builder. Get resources, buy tiles to score military, culture, or objective temples. And the art was plain so my expectations were low. But, you can throw the city builder theme away. Its more of an abstract strategy game where the addictive potential comes from the puzzle of activating the rows and columns or your "city". I also like the mechanic of passing early to regain much needed income as long as the other players continue. Fun and challenging. Makes me want to play again and try different strategies.

Hisashi Hayashi has yet to fail me, and I like the theme of this tile placement Roman city builder. It was highly unlikely to unseat Glory to Rome as the king of its theme, but Minerva proved surprisingly fun.

It's one hell of a fun solitaire game, even though you basically just "compete" against your own high score. The puzzle elements are great.

The game is just as fun with other players. The way you activate your buildings is very clever, and interesting.

Don't be turned off by some of the low-rating comments; A cursory look shows that several of them misunderstood rules and this resulted in a sub-optimal play experience.  I've only played this 4p, but I highly recommend it if you like games like Glen More or Suburbia.

Fairly standard in terms of collect resources to get tiles to get points etc etc. But there are some interesting aspects to the game in the way you activate the tiles and gain assistants to get additional activations. Needs to play a bit quicker than my first game though.

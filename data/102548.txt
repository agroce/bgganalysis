RATING: 1
I came here (BGG) to remind myself what game "dungeon fighter" was and was floored to see it had a rating of 6.9. FLOORED! This game is so horrible! I like dexterity games but this one had impossible challenges and really dumb and poorly written rules. How anyone can like this game is beyond me, but to have it have a 6.9; I feel like hell is freezing over or something.

My favorite co-op game so far.  Lots of sharp ups and downs of emotion in this game which makes it a great game for me.


The table surface matters a lot and will change the difficulty of the game.  

Lowered the rank a peg because some challenges are just a little too frustrating, and not in a good way.

Cracking light-hearted game involving throwing dice in unusual ways in order to defeat monsters in a dungeon. Limited replayability though as once you've gone through all the ways it will get a bit repetitive.

RATING: 10
Ok, so I have a thing for dexterity games.....this takes the simple, slightly absurd mechanic of rolling dice onto a target board and makes it fun, fun, fun!    It can seem daunting at first, the way the rules say you must bounce the die once before it goes onto the target board, but in reality, you'll soon learn that if you just sort of roll the die normally, it's surprisingly easy.  

Left at that, it'd be a very good game because it's just the right amount of luck and skill.  

But the designers didn't stop there;  they added just a few more mechanics to make for varied gameplay.  Plenty of unique monsters, plenty of crazy throws that can arise from different combinations of monsters, heroes, and equipment.  

The production values are excellent, with a nice thematic tower to hold and organize the cards and gold while also helping to keep table clutter to a minimum.


The result is a terrific game that would work well in a party situation or with experienced players.

Pretty entertaining game, but silly.  It's got a decent number of rules for such a "simple" game, but the work-to-fun ratio is still worth it.  The graphics and overall production are terrific.  Probably won't buy, but would be glad to play again.

1st play: Silly game, throwing dice to land on the target is fun. The game is very hard to do well, but playing with 2 kids didn't make it easy. Not as easy for young kids to pick up as I'd hoped, but it might still be a decent game.

2nd play: It was fun, but very hard to win, and lots of looking up of symbols. The game is still silly fun, but I can't imagine ever playing this with my kids in hopes of winning.

A brave party of adventurers wanders through a dungeon heading for a final showdown with a big bad monster.  Along the way, they roll dice to kill lesser monsters, while picking up weapons and healing potions.  So far, so what?  

Dungeon Fighter's novelty is that those dice are thrown onto a target in the middle of the table.  Where they land determines the damage done to the monster or to yourself if your aim is poor.  Monsters have special powers that get you doing things like throwing the dice while jumping or rolling it off your elbow.  We had some silly fun with this game, though I can see it getting old quickly.

The artwork is an odd mishmash of styles and I sometimes found it difficult to distinguish icons among the clutter of purely decorative work.  Production quality is good.

An interesting dexterity party game. Players are throwing dice at a target. Each 'monster' you face has different abilities, meaning ways to make you life difficult. Its a crazy game with a lot of fun and frustration because some of the dice throwing requirements are insane. You need a lot practise if you want to have a chance to beat the game.

Amusing game, from the writing of the rulebook to the actual gameplay. What a refreshing way to approach a dungeon crawler after so many that felt samey and generic! The dexterity elements are accessible enough for everyone to try, but challenging enough to keep your party getting murdered, and it's an intuitive enough system to figure out quickly with friends and/or new players. I feel a few of the components could look better than they do, but the card art is at least amusing, the dice are nice and I enjoy the tower element with the various level monsters.

Light hearted co-op.  May have to revise my opinion on co-ops as certainly less 'tense' than non co-ops.  Dexterity aspect was in keeping with theme and innovative - different ways to throw a dice.  The board was a target to roll the dice onto.  Played at introductory level but we still only overcame the final monster with one dice and one adventurer left alive.  Different to expectations.  Interesting to play.  But not a game I need to play again.

Nagyon ötletes, és partijátékhoz képest nagyon jól kidolgozott. Annak ellenére, hogy nem az én stílusom, egészen tetszett a koncepció, nem maga a dobálás, hanem a vásárolható cuccok, a testhelyzetek kombói stb:) Vicces. Tipikusan az a fajta partijáték, ami gémereknek való. Valahogy az jutott eszembe, hogy kb. olyan King of Tokyo szint, talán kicsit összetettebb és hosszabb. A lényeg, hogy különböző módokon kell kockákkal célbadobni, miközben ölünk mindenféle lényeket, és fejlesztéseket vásárolunk, és persze közben mi is sérülünk, halunk. Vannak jópofa dolgok, pl. az a nagy szív, ami mindenkinek 5 életet ad, ha eltaláljuk, vagy az újraéledéskor az 1/3 élet letakarása, stb. A bajom az volt vele, hogy néha már az alap pozitúra elég lehetetlenre sikerült, a kombókból meg teljesen esélytelen dolgok is kisülhetnek (pl. más kezét fogva dobni úgy, hogy közben ugrálok). Nekünk volt több olyan alapdobás is, ami kb. negyed óráig senki senkinek sem sikerült. Ez kicsit azért béna, de összességében nagyon ajánlom azoknak, akik szeretik a partijátékokat!

Dungeon Fighter is a silly, fun take on the usually overly serious dungeoncrawling genre. Throw dice at a target trying to do damage to monsters. The fun comes from the various curses and weapons that you receive. They change how you throw dice at the target. Use someone else's hand to throw the die, jump in the air, do a 360 and throw the die, hide under the table and throw the die, etc. etc. This is fun with the right group.

RATING: 7.5
This is a very fun dexterity game.  I love the art and feel of the game.  I initially hesitated paying a higher price for a highly produced family dexterity game.  After I purchased Dungeon Fighter and played it a few times, I have decided that I support highly produced dexterity games since the reasons that I play such games is to relax, have fun, and enjoy the feel of chucking dice around.  Having beautiful components is crucial in meeting these goals in my opinion. 

I love the art, the colors, and the general components included with the game.  The midevil mock dungeon fighter theme fits the play very very well.  I quite enjoy this game, and a few people I have introduced it to have purchased the game.

A very refreshing new twist on the dungeon crawling experience. If you are into fantasy themed games of the dungeon type nature then I recommend this game. It makes for a great casual/party game, and if you're skilled enough, perhaps you could even make it a serious experience. Either way you play it, it should create lots of laughs. It's become a fun favourite in my collection.

RATING: 8.5
A silly, fun, dice-throwing (literally), dungeon crawl game. You defeat the monsters by bouncing dice off the table onto a target board to do damage. Often a twist is added where you throw dice in different ways. For example, one monster will force you to put the die between your hands like you are praying, and through it out with both, or maybe jump and throw while in the air, or maybe throw at another players open hand, and they bump it onto the board. Lot's of different options Make for high replayability and there are 4 expansions to add to that. 

Very fun dexterity, albeit very silly, this game is loads of fun with the right people.

Loooooove this game! 

When I first played it, I expected it to just be this boring game where you toss dice at a target to kill monsters, and you simply repeated that until you got bored. 

But it ended up being extremely good for my game group and brought together my friends with vastly different tastes in what they want in a game. It encourages a good amount of cross-table cooperative talk when you buy and distribute items or when deciding what ability die to spend, you'll have some laughs as your friends miserably fail dice tossing challenges, and it's great being able to choose paths within the dungeons you explore.

I may have to go out and grab the expansions as soon as possible. The demo version my local game store had piiiiles of stuff that ups the difficulty and makes things more interesting.

Dungeon Fighter is nothing more than an overgrown filler: sure, rolling dice in ridiculous or impossible ways and being frustrated by the outcome can be fun yet on the whole you cannot rely on this game for that kind of amusement.

As a matter of fact, anything in Dungeon Fighter misses no chance to remind you how silly the authors wanted their game to be: it is the same as though they kept shouting «look how smarter than you we are!» at you over and over. (January 2013)

[b]Update[/b] - After further playing it, I still can’t enjoy Dungeon Fighter: thus, in April 2014 my rating dropped from 5 to 4.

Good dexterity/dungeon crawl, but cannot be played in a small space, you won't have room to maneuver unless there's 5ft or more on each side of the table.  Some of the trick shots are also near impossible so may require house-ruling (step back + blow off hand for smokers = impossible).

I had fun enough playing it, but it's a bit of a one trick pony with the dice throwing gimmick.  You'll be doing a lot of laughing as the game has you tossing dice in dozens of different ways: under your leg, off your head, catapulting them with cards, etc, all in an attempt to land them on a target to kill monsters.

Even with the gimmick being the most prominent feature, there are some decisions to be made here and some teamwork required.

To me, it's probably good for one or two plays before the novelty wears off and loses its fun factor.

I don't like cooperative games. I don't like dexterity games. This short cooperative dexterity game with a D&D theme is fun nevertheless!

+ Since the base mechanic is dexterity, the cooperating players can freely exchange information. So unlike other cooperative games, this one does not suffer by players constantly giving each other barely rule-conform hints. 

+ Since it is cooperative, everyone present actually roots for the success of the player attempting a dexterity feat, which yields a nicely positive, yet still competitive atmosphere (since players may voluntarily increase the difficulty of their dexterity task - "hold my beer and watch this!").

0 The RPG/D&D theme fits nicely, but on the other hand it might put off non-RPG folks - or divide players along that line. 

+ It plays fairly quick, so one will always find an opportunity to play it. 

- I don't recommend playing it multiple times per evening. The first one or two games are great, but from the fourth game onwards I never ever seem to hit anymore. (Well, ok, that might be just me - and that is also the reason why I cannot play golf.)

RATING: 3
Based on 1 play with 5 players:

This is NOT a dexerity game which you can just pick up and have fun playing. It demands practice. That might not be a turn-off for some, but is completely incompatible with what I want out of a dexterity game. Why would I suffer through something as unfun as this just to maybe have some fun with it later? Crokinole is fun IMMEDIATELY and MORE depth to the skill!

Ontop of how difficult just hitting the target can be, there's all sorts of monsters, equipment, and rooms that require you to throw dice in a certain way. I imagine the designers put these in to give it a fun, lighthearted feel. But when your base skill is this difficult to master it ends up being a painful exercise in frustration. Perhaps these "added fun!" rules don't even belong in a game with player elimination.

When the players encounter a scenario where the combination of special throw rules would make it nearly impossible to hit the target, you are allowed to skip the encounter by having everyone suffer a damage instead. This came up THREE TIMES during our play. There's just too many whacky throw rules, and one was so tough (dropping it off your nose) that we couldn't even do it on its own, let alone in combination with anything else!

Everything also just feels poorly tuned given the difficulty of the game. The player health to monster damage ratio is way the fuck off.

The only likable thing about the game is the monster art. It's utterly adorable and it's a damn shame it's in such a shitty game. Part of me wants to take the monster deck and re-purpose it for some dungeon crawling game of my own invention just so it doesn't go to waste.

Also - I harp on this a lot - but there are WAY too many symbols in this game to make the cards/sheets textless. In particular having no summary of abilities on my character sheet really bugged me.

Everyone ended our first game angrily (a rarity.) We then agreed that it could probably be fixed with a combination of careful practice and house rules. But we couldn't even decide on house rules as we all hated different aspects of the game so much.

Sent immediately to the Closet of Shame, from which it shall not return (except to trade/sell.)

I’ve played this three times now, but never with more than 3 players. I would love to try it with more, and perhaps will once the expansions are released. It’s a silly fun coop dexterity-kind-of-game, but the style and story of the game is a dungeon crawl: you defeat monsters which give you money which you can then use to buy items which enhance your abilities – which you are going to need if you are going to succeed in killing the final boss who is always tough! The way you’re slaying monsters is by rolling dice and getting them to land on a big target plate/disc which is laying on the board. However, you’re not just rolling like normal, no, the monsters typically require you to close your eyes while doing it, to toss the die over your head, to let another player shake your wrist while you’re throwing etc.! This makes the game a lot of fun I found.

It isn’t a long game, which is good for such a silly game. I’m not going to buy it as I don’t like it enough, and my wife didn’t care much for it, but I can see it being a hit with a couple of friends. It should, of course, not be taken too seriously, but it is a rather enjoyable dexterity game.

Very impressed with this game initially. I didn't have high hopes for it but found it fun. I laughed at some of the positions I got myself in, I had to bounce a dice off my head onto a target! I can see this being a light game, when in the mood for a few laughs, but question the replay value. I can see some good scenarios and groups where this game would come in handy.

Very unique. Haven't played through the whole game yet. It's pretty difficult, but I wouldn't play this one to win anyway. This one is more about having fun along the way. You end up doing some crazy dice throwing (yes, literally throwing) and it is hysterical to watch your family or friends try to land the dice on the target. Great for families or kids.

Probably the best dexterity game I've played. The difficulty inherent in any dexterity game is multiplied by the tension of trying to help your team progress. "Special Throws" make the game a hilariously good time without veering into the obnoxiousness of some other "do silly things" games.

RATING: 9
Played a quick 2 player game to learn the rules. This game is a great party / pretzels & beer game. Very easy rules. This is essentially a dexterity game, not a dungeon crawl, where you throw dice at a big bullseye in the middle of the table, and certain monsters make your throws harder (for one, you have to throw blindfolded).  The wife rolled her eyes at yet another "swords and monsters" game, so the theme can alienate some, but I think it's solid enough to overcome that.

My wife hates this one for some reason.

Interesting mechanics: dexterity game where you must toss dice on a board in interesting ways. You must try to toss dice on a target to damage monsters while doing a dungeon crawl.

Make some room around the table and stretch a bit beforehand! Full co-op strategy dividing up those dice and appropriating each character's skills to take on the monster, then the awkward fun of trying to nail the trick shots against hard enemies or to snag big bonus items make for a hilarious night.  Only issue I might have is that it is almost TOO hard for the scoring system tallied up at the end.  I think out of 9 dungeon crawls we've survived 2.

Przygodowa kooperacja, lekka i idealna na małą imprezę do 6 osób. Mamy tutaj i potwory, wspólną walkę przeciw grze i ciekawe sposoby na rzucanie kostką. Wściekasz się gdy po rzucie kostką wynik jest inny niż chciałeś? W tej grze to norma, bo rzucanie spod nogi czy z czoła to dopiero wyzwanie. Polecam do tej gry duży stół i ogólnie więcej miejsca, bo trzeba się też trochę poruszać. Generalnie ja nie przepadam za grami zręcznościowymi i ruchowymi, więc mnie nie urzekła, ale myślę, że dla dzieci temat i mechanika są świetne.

This game was fun and made you do goofy things in order to roll the die when using certain weapons. You are just rolling die onto the target and counting those as hits against the monsters.

It really hurts me to give this game a sort of low grade, because I really like its idea/concept, but truth is it doesn't really have a lot of replayability nor immersion (even though the art is very pretty and funny, there isn't really a story there). You are just throwing dice in crazy ways over and over again.

One of our friends brought this to game night last night.

You have to throw dice in different manners in different situations (with your eyes closed, off your nose, etc) and try to get them onto a target (the board) to kill monsters.  Once the gimmick wore off, there's not much game there.  

I don't hate it, but it's not for me.  I'd play it again if everyone else wanted to.

Good once. The die throwing makes for an interesting experience. The couple of really ridiculous throws that might come up should make for a good story after the fact.

The game scales up a little more quickly than it feels like it should. It kept me on my toes, which might be considered a strength given this game's weaknesses; however, it then felt like any successful throw happened randomly, and the game ended on a low note.

I don't like co-ops... but this is a good game.   I don't like dexterity games...  but this is a really good game.  Zany fun, well-produced components.  Creates a good team atmosphere as the party ventures into the dungeon and throws dice at monsters in various ways.   Splitting up the loot is a fun part of the game too.   Manages to capture the feel of a dungeon crawl, which is surprising and to its credit.  There are some rules questions that will come up mostly related to conflicting bonuses and penalties, so be prepared to house rule those and just keep the game moving along.  Cool, cartooney fantasy art... almost Small-World-esque.   Pretty unique and riotous game.

Dexterity games are not my favorite nor forte, and this is no exception. However, the game is less about killing monsters and more about forcing players into ridiculous throwing positions, and as a result its surprisingly good at generating laughs. Each of the characters seem to be unique and fun, but as one might expect, the game variability is fairly low. Fun for a play or three, but nothing I want to explore further.

A ton of fun.  Like that it has a relatively quick (and silly) dungeon crawling feel to it.  Game can be pretty unforgiving and though we've won the majority of our games (barely), it tends to always come right down to the wire... and that's just on easy!  The rulebook that comes with it is pretty much garbage; the revised English one is a must as quite a few things are not even mentioned in the one that comes with the game.

Great game for all groups (family, non-gamers and gamers).  It was a very hard game at first because our table was not good for throwing the dice.  Once we got our shots under control and were able to instruct new players on their shots the game became easier.  It is still slightly challenging, but I think we will have to use a higher difficulty (we normally play 3 of each colour.. I think).  I love stringing together different weapons.  I love the dungeon theme and normally I do not.  I love that you get to find new items and get gold when you kill monsters.

Teljesen egyedi mechanizmusok jellemzik. Nem fogja senki azt mondani, hogy ez olyan, mint az xy játékban. Ez már egy hatalmas jó pont nálam. Amúgy nem igazán komolyan vehető, de hát nem is ez a célja. Szerepjátékos múlttal rendelkező nagyobb, nem gémer társaságban nagyon jól működhet egy-egy bulin.

Whoa! A cooperative dice-tossing dungeon crawler (yes, tossing). You certainly can't fault the authors for being unimaginative. I actually really like the idea which is sort of Boules: The Boardgame, with dice, in a dungeon. The problem is that dice really aren't quite the right components for this kind of thing because much of the dexterity element goes right out the window. I'd much rather play this with proper balls out in the park. With or without my silly sorcerer's hat on.

The comic artwork is superb and very funny, and so is the game for the first few attempts. However, having to hit a target with dice soon proves to be very frustrating.

Hard party game. quite impossible in 1, in 2 and in 3 (my fiancè and i play it using four characters) but funny and fool.
You laugh, you play, you get mad...and when you finally win
you celebrate!
let's say that...some skills are hard to manage (i.e. throw the dice on the spot from under the table, cause you're fighting a giant, blowing them, cause you want to use a mythical blowgun, from your nose, cause you can't breathe the mephitical gas on the ground) but not without tons of laugh.

Nice drawings, well written and funny rules

I love dexterity and dungeon games, but after three plays of this it just fell a little flat for me. It would make a decent party game for the laughs, but it's definitely not a game to take serious.

I just couldn't get good at bouncing the dice no matter what I tried. Plus I'm not really big on co-op games to begin with. I'd play again. Hopefully not 3 gamse in a row, but it's not something I'd buy.

For a dexterity dungeon game, I'd rather play Catacombs.

Love the artwork! Excellent production. Was amusing to play solo so I can only imagine how fun this would be with the right group. It's tough though!

UPDATE: I was right! It really does depend on the group and the folk I played with saw merits to the game but it just didn't excite them. I see no fault with the game, but I am doubtful I will get this one back to the table.

Update -- I continue to find this fantastic, but my group groans whenever I suggest it. 

The tough part about the game is that it is completely ridiculous, but also very hard. So people won't take it seriously, but you need to do well, and be very consistent, in order to win. 

------------

It's a gimmick game that is in fact very fun. The gimmick works well and is actually thematic, as there is quite a bit of skill and you can improve, even on the silly shots. 

Most importantly, it doesn't overstay its welcome. Games have been under an hour, which is about right. It's definitely tough to win.

The idea is great. It can play out like a much better thought-out version of Munchkin and with the right group it is hilariously fun! However...the dice-bouncing is next to impossible to control without the right table and thus fails miserably! SURELY there was a better method to this? Hell, the designers could have used a race-track and some Z-Balls (from bisikle) to better effect. 
I like the silly theme and the enemies are funny.
Overall, just a strange game. Hard to recommend...but not bad to play.

Dungeon Fighter is a cooperative dexterity game that involves bouncing dice off the table and onto a big bullseye target. Sometimes you must perform odd throws like behind the back, under the leg, spin shots, rebound shots, rolling the dice off your nose, or using your neighbor's hand to throw the dice. It's a silly game, obviously, but also a VERY challenging game. The difficulty keeps me coming back, but I can see it leading to frustration for other personalities. I guess you could always try the easy level, but my belief is that Champions of Gaming never play on the easy level!

If games are serious business for you, without exception, then this is definitely not your game. Why are you even reading this?

The sexism sucks and the expansions are overpriced. And I'm not convinced all of the trick shots are possible, certainly not on some tables. But... if you're willing to put up with those things, surprisingly delightful.

Note: The English rules say you "throw" the die and it has to "bounce" at least once. This makes it sound much more ballistic than it should be, which in turn makes the game impossible. I am pretty sure the intention is that you can just roll the die, and the 'bounce' only has to be striking the table. It doesn't have to go BOING and fly back up into the air.

RATING: 1
Throwing dice on a target to deal damage to monsters is an original approach to the dungeon crawl theme, and I don't mind a dexterity game once in a while. But throwing a die and making it stop where you want (or sometimes even stop on the target board at all) is so difficult that the game is less about dexterity than dumb luck. And then there are the weapons and monsters that force you to throw the die in silly ways: jumping, from under your leg, with your eyes closed, from the tip of your nose and so on. Also, it takes at least three or four times as long as it would be tolerable for such a silly game. The ugly artwork doesn't help.

Es un juego bastante original. La tematica es de dungeon crawler (eres un heroe, matas monstruos, avanzas por una mazmorra, etc) pero el giro de los acontecimientos viene con el desarrollo del juego. 

En el cual hay que lanzar los dados, de maneras curiosas/divertidas/absurdas, para que caigan en una especie de diana (el tablero de combate del juego) y en funcion de si eso se consigue o no, se infligen los daños en combate al enemigo. 

a mi no me convence mucho. por un lado, de por si, no me convence mucho hacer el chorras durante del desarrollo de un juego. para hacer el chorras ya existen juegos que lo animan como el tabú... pero es que ademas de eso esta la cuestion de que aqui esa mecanica esta pegada a un juego que de por si seria un hack&slash basico, pero basico de que se lo puede inventar cualquiera en un rato libre en clase sin comerse mucho el coco. 

Le doy el aprobado por la originalidad y buena presentacion, pero definitivamente es un juego que yo no compraria ni para regalarlo.

RATING: 6
Here's a strange amalgam: half dungeon crawl, half super crazy dexterity game. The design, while undoubtedly fun, is seriously at odds with itself. Why bother to include so many complications when victory is largely determined by how consistently you can land your die on the board. Learning from the rules is far more confusing than it needs to be, especially considering that when you pull out something like this you just want to throw it on the table and play, not learn intricate rules. So it helps to have someone who knows how to play. Finally, the difficulty seems geared for intense repeat play (i.e. it's really hard) rather than casual play, which would probably be more appropriate. We managed to kill some of the green (easiest) monsters, but never really had a chance after that. We played twice, and it was a riot, but we never even had a chance, and I'm certain we misinterpreted or skipped many rules. So it's dumb fun, and maybe there's a real game in there, but who knows.

I didnt know dice could be used for anything other than movement and actions! This game cleverly uses dice to attack monsters by physically throwing dice on to a target board. The best part is to try to throw the dice according to the wacky instructions indicated on the cards/dungeon room. We had a blast with it, eventhough we got killed in the 6th room ;-P...

great game to not take too seriously.  If you want an adult game, don't buy this.  If you have kids or want a fun drinking game, this might be a hit.  I have several friends who have this and play quite a bit amongst themselves and their families.  It's a good, interactive game that requires you to conquer dungeon dwellers by rolling the dice in non-traditional manners (IE rolling it off your elbow.  The kicker- the dice have to land on the board or they do not count.  tougher monsters require tougher methods of rolling.  I'll state again as I have in many reviews:  If you don't like games of chance, then this game, and life, are not designed with you in mind.

El nem tudom képzelni, hogy mi az a szituáció, amelyben eszembe jutna, hogy ezzel a játékkal szeretnék játszani. Egy olyan kooperatív játék, amelyben semmi érdekes sincsen, labirintusból kell kijutnunk és közben szörnyeket kell legyőznünk kockadobások segítségével. Mindösszesen azzal próbálnak a játékba színt vinni, hogy a kockadobásokat - amelyeket egyébkét az asztal közepére kitett pályára próbáljuk dobni - variálják össze-vissza (láb alatt, orról, asztal alól, egy lépésre az asztaltól, ugorva). Vicces akar lenni, de ha vicces játékot akarok játszani, biztos nem ezt veszem elő.

We got this because we were looking for another light party game to play as people showed up on game nights.  What we got was a game that is longer to set up and play than what we were looking for... but also surprisingly challenging.  We probably won't play this as a party game after all, but rather as a game for slightly more serious cooperative gaming experience.  In fact, with no exaggeration, after 10 plays I can honestly state that this is the most difficult cooperative game we own, as we have 2 wins in 10 tries playing at the EASIEST difficulty.  I can't imagine trying a harder difficulty at this point... which is a shame, since many of the most interesting monsters appear at higher difficulty levels.

We need more practice!

*edit*
OK, the difficulty scales greatly depending on the table surface.  We played with new players on harder tables 3 times and won 2 of those 3 games (and only lost against the final boss in the other game, with full life/no scars).  I have since played solo at normal difficulty (3/3/3/5 card level breakdown) on a hard kitchen table and can routinely beat the game with only 4 heroes.

(P.S.  Michelle says "This is my favourite dungeon crawler BY FAR.")

A fun dice chucking (literally) game. Throw dice at a target board while balancing on one leg, from under the table and off your elbow for maximum damage.

The one thing about the game is that it does take a bit of time to play and it might not be for everyone as it is a dexterity game that asks you to do some very silly things with the dice.

Initial rating: 5.5 (July 2015)

Dungeon Fighter is a cooperative silly game in a dungeon, I should love it but I don’t. Furthermore I can’t really say why I don’t love it, but I didn’t have the fun I expected from it. The rules are easy, but perhaps they are too complex and involved for a party game, there are a lot of text in the characters so the game didn’t flow quickly as every player checked which power they could use (I realize this will get better with more plays). I played with 5 and 6 players and the downtime is excessive for such a simple game, so I think it is best with 4 players.

It is however a fun and novel game. Love the theme. It features good art and components but I’m worried about component damage (with the slam shot for example). The game is HARD to beat, even on easy and I enjoy this aspect (we almost got creamed by a lousy first level goblin). It has a funny rulebook (I especially enjoyed when you level up your hero to the Angelic level :D). I love the silly ways to throw the dice and it is fun to see your teammates too, but the novelty passes quickly and you get bored when it isn’t your turn to play.

It is reminiscent of Cutthroat Caverns, but much better IMO.
 
Bottom line, I thought Dungeon Fighter was going to be extremely fun, but it was merely ok fun for me. I should love it but I don´t. I already sold my copy but I would definitive play if requested. I think I would like it better if the game flowed more quickly.

2015-04-12 - This dexterity game is silly fun. I think I might like it a little better than Rampage, even. Bouncing dice off the table isn't an easy skill to master, which makes for some great moments. It's not a game for people who care about winning, though. The journey is truly where the fun is here.

2017-11-06 - Like Rampage, this is another game that is a really good novelty. I'll pull it off the shelf for the right group, but it's not going to see the table very often.

A dicey dexterity game that requires you to physically throw your dice in different ways and combinations in order to hit a target on the table. Neat idea. A bit tedious in playing. Your experience of the game will depend on your dice-throwing-from-weird-positions-and-places-skillz. If you are too good, the game will not be a challenge. If you are not good, the game will prove impossible to win. I can see this hitting the sweet spot for some, but not me. I give an additional point to this game because the art work is exceptional, and funny as hell.

Very unusual implementation of a hack and slash dungeon crawler. Players actually fight monsters in a dexterity challenge by trying to hit the target. Its certainly fun, but I feel that some awkward throws don't really work. For example the "bounce OVER the card" cannot be played on a glass table. Some are much too easy, and others too hard. Overall quite fun, but not the uproarious laughter game that I expected.

Silly "dungeon crawler" variable dice rolling party game. I don't actually see this game as having a dungeon crawler theme. You have different paths you can take, however, everything is scripted. Go here and fight a monster by rolling dice. Maybe a special way, maybe not. Get some reward for killing it. A very curious design with the different ways of rolling dice makes for enjoyable and laughable moments, however, I have a feeling that this game just doesn't stand up to repeated play. I love the idea though!

This game is a ton of fun.  Often times it is hard to get my family to play a serious game and this fits perfectly right now.  Its great to see people try their best to win a game while looking extremely silly doing it.  I can't wait to play this with more friends when they come over.

Dungeon Fighter is a dungeon crawler that doesn't take itself seriously at all. With all the crazy dice rolling that's going on in this game, this one actually makes for a nice party game.

RATING: 7.5
In Dungeon Fighter, a fully cooperative board game, players take on the roles of heroes venturing deep into a three-tier dungeon. Along the way, they explore the dungeon, search its many rooms, and face endless hordes of vicious monsters. Best of all, your skill determines the ability of your character. Can you kill Medusa without looking into her eyes, defeat the Minotaur in the labyrinth, or resist the breath of the dragon? Will you be able to hit a target by throwing the dice under your leg with your eyes closed?

Crazy and surprisingly fun. I don't know if I can state it's unbalanced or not developed well enough (seems like in some cases you just can't be strong enough to defeat the monsters) but it's a light & quick game that should be played for fun.

Charming and entertaining game about trying to throw dice in different ways to land on the target with a dungeon crawl theme.  Quite difficult although I've always played on the normal level.  So far, my groups have found our dice throwing skills to leave a good bit to be desired.  Types of throws can be modified to enhance attacks with different equipment cards, sometimes are required to kill a monster, or are required in different rooms of the dungeon.  Art is pleasantly whimsical.

A dexterity-based co-operative dungeon-crawler. The more weapons you try to use, the more dangerous the terain is and the more special abilities your opponent has, the harder it gets to kill him. 
Have the german edition which tries a bit hard to be funny in the rulebook and has a few graphic flaws, but that doesn't really make the game worse. And yes, you can play this game sober and it's still good. Really.

Something completely different with the dice-rolling dexterity element and lots of silly fun. Reminiscent of a dungeon crawler but with a big dose of humour. Kids loved the  fainting aspect. Wasn't sure of the dexterity element (we're not that into dexterity games) but it turned out to be a fun family game when we're in the mood for something a little more lighthearted and some good dice-chuckin' fun.
Update: Great fun for the first handful of plays but then quickly lost its appeal I guess because the  dice rolling novelty wore off. Once it started to drag for us it was a sign to let it go.  Reduced rating from 7.5- 6.5 due to lack of staying power.

This is a fun game, but boy, it's insanely hard! It has got a very steep learning curve, since you will have your butt kicked by the game multiple times before you manage to kill a couple of monsters.

RATING: 8
This cooperative game featuress simple rules and different difficulty levels that you can choose from based on your physical ineptitude.  You might lose often, but you'll go down laughing!  The basic mechanic is that you choose a (hilariously illustrated) hero and then fight dungeon monsters by bouncing dice at a flat bulls-eye.  However, it gets much more interesting than that!  Some situations will present extra physical challenges like throwing backwards or from under the table, and you can add these difficulties yourself if you wish to cause more damage to the monsters using weapons.

It's silly and awkward without going beyond the pale, and it's a fresh kind of fun for board game masters and newbies alike.  It really gets the group going with scheming, teasing, cajoling, and cheering.  Nice components, as well.

Best used on a real table!  No sprawling out on the floor for this one.

Played it once and see no need to play again.  While some of the other players seemed to have the hang of bouncing the dice, I was horrible at it and it made it very frustrating to play.  The concept was good, but the execution was lacking.  

Pales in comparison to Catacombs because it is much easier to flick discs than bounce dice, so you can have actual fun with the game play.

RATING: 4
This game is so silly, but so much fun. And the silliness is very thematic: We sucked as much as the wannabe adventurers we were portraying.

Bouncing a die onto a target is apparently pretty difficult. We thought we had it more or less down after the first game, which we lost at the beginning of level two, but then came the annoying monkey combined with pious: throw under your leg by flinging the die out of your hands while they're in "prayer position." He nearly wiped the party, and the next monster (bounce the die off your head, then the table, then hit the target) finished the job.

But that right there is a hoot in play. The setup seems fiddly at first, and there are a few specials and things to learn, but after that it's just laughing at each other while acting like idiots. Few games I can think of carve away everything that isn't that as well as this one.

---

My thoughts on this one crystallized a couple of months later, when I realized that all the fussy bullshit that wasn't the fun artwork or the dexterity stuff was just that: fussy bullshit. Oss does everything Dungeon Fighter does in a third the time, and is more fun in every way. Sold it.

Wowzers!  I've only played this once solo, but what a beautiful game.  Everything is so well thought out, and the components are a work of art.  Besides being hot, eye candy hot, it's a lot of fun also.  I haven't found a dungeon crawl board game that I really enjoy, but this one I think will Jones theory out all my other dungeon crawl games.  
Initial rating : 9 (2012/06/25) but I feel that it'll stay about this rating after multiple plays, as I feel this will work well with my casual gaming group, and will be fun as a gateway game as well.  Plus we might be able to integrate it into our D&D days.

I can hear my brain cells dying with white foam in the corner of their little mouths when I'm playing Dungeon Fighter, but I cannot not play it. It relates to Tumblin-Dice, as [gameid=57390] relates to Carrom. An annoying and uncontrollable dexterity game, boiled in the pure essence of stupidity and chaos, yet it won't let go, you have to make that "[i]this seriously is the last[/i]" shot from under the table with eyes shot, spinning around, slamming the dice onto the bullseye from the tip of your nose. My rate is unreasonable and unexplainable, but I stand beside it. Even the fact, that the German print intentionally left out marginally important stuff from the box, like for example, the rulebook, cannot annoy me. On the contrary, it amuses, and kinda makes sense now, after head-butting the tabletop.

This is my favorite deeper dexterity game.  The problem is that the game tends to be very hard for "average" people.  I'm constantly required to play it on the easiest difficulty, and then it's either very hard, or a bit of a cake walk depending on other's skills.

So this game is rather group dependent.  The art, and production really help set the tone.  The rule book is a COMPLETE DISASTER, so I eventually made a virtually complete player aid that the designer requested to use as an official source.

RATING: 7
Fantasy, dexterity, cooperative play, and dungeon crawling? A mix that actually works really, really well. Everyone I've played this with has enjoyed the game. There's something awfully satisfying as throwing that dice right on target for massive damage, or pulling off jumping and spinning in the air before throwing the dice (if you even hit the target you're a hero). Highly recommended!

Hey! A dexterity dungeon crawler? Sign me up. It's a fun game, some of the stunts are much harder to fulfill than others. You can purchase new attacks, shields, etc. Although I'm not sure I love the cooperative play it is a quick, light game so no biggy. Expansions are needed to turn this into a much better experience as right now it doesn't seem super-replayable.

Then again, I am new to the hobby and have much to get to know, but I'd think this games deserves a bit more of appreciation: a good theme (I like the dungeon crawling stuff, and I like how this game makes hilarious fun of it), and simple rules, it's not too long (I for one don't mind spending a lot of time on a single game, but I do understand why it's a plus if it's on the short end), and the gameplay... it's just awesome. Wih a couple of friends,  fun is sure to be had.

To me this is a really fun light game. When I am trying to come up with a game to bring to a get together that will make everyone laugh, this is the one I am most likely to pull out. I do not think we have ever beaten the game, it has proven difficult for the people I have played with. That being said, this is not one that we leave angry at one person because we lost. There is little chance for an alpha player to take over. For the most part everyone is pretty bad at the game, and we laugh the entire time we play. It is a wonderful gaming experience. 

This being said, I wish the theme were more kid friendly. I think that this is a game with mechanics and silliness that are well suited for children, but some of the characters might not be.

Delightfully dumb dice chuckin' fun.
As a dexterity game, I could take or leave this, but as an "experience" game, with a group into role-playing a crappy low-level adventuring party in over their heads it's a blast. Our two games of it managed to evoke real comedy, drama, and outbursts of cheering, jeering, and constant laughter. Everyone loved it so much they wanted to play it again.

Note: I traded Descent for this. I think, given how much, shouting, laughing, cheering fun everyone had, and how excited it made them to play it, I got the better deal.

It's a mix between being family/goofy oritented and also being wildly inapporpriate in subtle ways for kids as far as theme goes. It's actually quite fun a nice LIGHT dexterity game. 

People who criticize this game and say it's too hard or "impossible" to skillfully throw the dice don't realize the subtle and varied tecniques possible in dice throwing. I.E. YOU"RE DOING IT WRONG. You're just THROWING the dice instead of thinking of some more subtle ways. I'll show you if you meet me in person. This is actually really a skill based game--fast and fun and a nice twist on the dunge/dexterity games. I like how you can play with just one, and unlike Catacombs is fully cooperative and a little lighter and faster too--making it more accessible.

People have criticized this game as being too random in the sense that you have little or no control over the dice. I felt this way the first time playing it, struggling to survive even on easy. When you throw the dice, it seems to hard at first to be able to use dexterity and cleverness alone to increase it's chances of hitting where you want. THIS IS NOT THE CASE. You need to play this game more, you need to realize that there are more strategies than "throwing the dice". The "claw machine drop" is probably one of the better strategies that utilizes subtlety in your dice role.

This is a game that requires more than one playthrough to get good. It's very analogous to darts. Darts are not random either. Darts is just a hard game until you've practiced a bit. Same with this.

Also, you can make the game more interesting and perhaps easier depending on your style by utilizing different types of dice. I purchased "iron dice" dice made of heavy metal for this game. It allows for additional control and moves and certainly feels awesome to throw. You should consider buying heavy dice like that, especially if you're having too much trouble controlling the plastic ones. It's really fun.

Despite the game being fun, it's actually overly challenging for many people looking for a more casual dexterity game. There's a pretty high penalty for punishement and you feel like you're letting down the whole team. Despite the humor and lighthearted feel, unless you house-rule this to make the game easier and to make some of the weapons easier (for example, there's a weapon that you can buy that gives plus damage if you roll the dice off your nose. However, unless you're incredibly dexterous, it's almost never worth it to buy this weapon because the difficulty is so much greater you won't be able to achieve it often enough. Usually, it's almost always better to buy white dice instead of items and this is a problem since every player has a number of items slot. The items should be cheaper or more useful or both OR expect this game to be for VERY agile people--which the box art, theme, and description don't really appeal to)

It's not a bad dexterity game and can be a whole lot of fun especially in the right mood and right crowd, but it's not the ideal dexterity game I was looking for. I appreciate the humor but wish that more effort went into balancing abilities and rules. Most people don't understanding that it's actually better in many cases to "drop" the die forward rather than "throw" it like the rulebook describes. Even gently, "Throwing" the die almost always does not allow for enough subtlty that you'll hit the board where you want except by chance, and this is supposed to be as much a game of skill as something like darts--indeed, the board almost looks like a dart board. 

The skill-curb is a little too high but if you're interested in becoming good at it or accepting that the enjoyment curb for SOME might be lower since they will be shocked to learn they really do have to sharpen their tecnique to make it more fun and satisfying (including allowing for any number of "practice throws" first), then you'll enjoy it a lot more.

This game is silly fun but still challenging and replayable.  I can't believe there are not more people talking about it...  CHECK IT OUT - it may be just what your group is looking for.  Just don't be afraid to institute "practice throw" rules that suit your group.

Okay, let's make it clear that no one really cares about the dungeon crawling aspect of the game... but the "throw in the target" aspect is just great! Be aware that there is a WIDE gap between the Normal and Hard modes (never lost at Normal, never won at Hard).

RATING: 8
Unapologetically ridiculous, Dungeon Fighter is one of the most polarizing games in my collection.

People swear that it is all luck... yet repeated plays show that skill is required, no less than in crokinole or Catacombs.  People swear the end-boss is too tough... yet it can be planned with careful play.  People think they're above the stupid stunts you must do for the bonuses... but time and time again, when people drop their cool reserve and land an bulls-eye while bouncing a die off their forehead, the entire table erupts in laughter and applause.  Those moments are infinitely more cool than simply rolling a handful of dice and tallying the hits... or placing a passive-aggressive cube to block an opponent.

Lose your cool.  Play more Dungeon Fighter.

Co-operative dice throwing. A decent idea but the throwing is too difficult for the game to actually work properly. The rulebook would also benefit from a bit more blind playtesting.

Outrageous dungeon-dexterity nonsense that makes the perfect game when Catacombs is all too sensible and heavy. The terrific vein of oddball humour is what helps maintain the impact.

It's a great idea, and it makes a fun, silly party game. Anyone can play without having to learn much. Turns are very short and fast, so everyone gets to keep playing. I just don't know how often I'd actually want to play this. As a dexterity game it's a bit off-putting because the dexterity mechanic (bouncing a die) is so hard to control accurately; add a couple of silly restrictions like launching it off your nose while jumping and it's a total crapshoot. Ah well, it's not a game to be taken seriously!

I do like the artwork though and the entire presentation is great quality. The thick board and the card tower are nice additions.

Very fun party style dungeon crawling game. Took us three game until we won. It gets better with more plays and works very well with kids. Very nice components. You can roll it underhand like a normal dice roll which makes the mechanics work better. Trying to actually bounce it high makes it much harder.

愚昧的丟骰party game 
還算不錯玩
不過有點吃場地的桌子
規則:
*從四張boss地圖抽一張，在從剩下的地圖抽兩張，三張疊在一起或是排在一起形成地城，商店都在最後一格
*隨機抽一張魔王卡放在地圖最後面，根據難度選擇怪物卡片並放在塔中綠黃藍紅>上到下，張數為 easy 4442 normal 3335 hellish 2228，裝備卡放在塔的最下面
*玩家拿一個英雄，跟生命標記在滿格位置，隊伍獲得兩元跟一白骰放在寶箱圖板上，並選擇一位領袖，將三顆顏色骰給起始玩家
*遊戲主要分成三個階段，直到打倒大魔王為止
A 移動 只能照箭頭移動，每到一間都要打一次怪，打完怪才能拿房間獎勵或是商店
-商店時開人數加3張裝備卡來買，兩元可買一白骰，一元全體補一滴
-噴泉 全部血補滿(受傷的還是在)
-寶箱 拿對應獎勵，裝備的話就暗抽一張
-危險房 必須照上面指示丟骰
B 遭遇打怪 每間房一開始都要從最上面抽一張怪來打，打贏獲得金錢，戰鬥規則如下
-起始玩家開始選骰丟，骰子一定要碰到桌面一次，落在靶的哪個數字扣幾滴，落在洞中(只要碰到桌子)骨頭上沒在靶上都是失誤，會被怪獸攻擊扣血，如果骰出結果有眼睛可發動能力，丟的骰不會回手直到打爆怪為止
-下一位玩家如果還有顏色骰可用就用，否則可選用白骰(眼睛的話能力可任選)，或是全部人扣怪物等級血量被打敗(不會被裝備影響)回收三色骰(打魔王不能執行此動作)
-靶中心是10如果又有眼睛就一擊必殺(可選擇一擊殺或是用技能)，交界處的話看哪邊面積大，平手取小的
-血低於1就昏倒，此次戰鬥不在參與，醒來要放一個傷疤標記(蓋掉一技能跟少三滴)，三標記就掛了
-一骰贏或得兩白骰，兩骰贏或得一白骰，有被打敗後不算
C 清理階段 打贏後拿錢，三骰傳給下一位玩家，昏倒的醒來跟拿一個傷疤標記，可任意交換裝備，但是角色要能帶
*如果發現有不合理的擲骰組合，可全部人扣一滴，把那張怪移到該疊最下面，在抽一張，如果是該疊最後一張則抽下一級的

A strange band of adventurers venture into an unknown dungeon in search for glory and loot. This game takes your usual run-of-the-mill dungeon delve and turns it on its head. Throw dice in various wacky stances on to a board to deal damage and kill monsters. Access various player abilities to whittle down foes. Collect loot, gold, and equipment to bolster your adventuring party. Very good, kind of wacky game that brings a ton of fun and laughter to the table.

Brilliant production values.  There is a real humour to the artwork and character abilities which has caused much merriment to players.  Not quite as much, however, as the attempts by various people to throw die with the noses, elbow and mid-jump, more often than not failing abysmally.  If I ever win on Easy, I will be shocked beyond belief.  The pure difficulty will likely effect the amount of time this comes out but, when it does, I do not doubt that it will be extremely fun.

El típico dungeon cooperativo, si no fuera porque los monstruos se matan directamente lanzando los dados sobre una diana. Pero los lanzadores deben tirar adoptando distintas posiciones, resultado de combinar la posición a la que te obligue la habitación del dungeon, el arma con el que ataques y el tipo de monstruo que sea. Seguro que no te aburrirás.

Update 2-20-2018 (6 -> 7): By some miracle, myself and three others actually won a game of Dungeon Fighter, and by all accounts it felt extremely rewarding. The dexterity element of this game really makes it shine above traditional cooperative games.

(+) Absolutely THE most novel dexterity game I have played, modeling classic dungeon crawling tropes. A unique and memorable experience. 
(+) The art and tone carry throughout the game, adding to the absurdity of the dexterity challenges.
(+) The challenges themselves provide quite a bit of entertainment, and success feels very rewarding.

(-) Brutally difficult. Not just because of the dexterity (though it plays a big part) but becuase of the ruleset.
(-) Concerned about depth, but hey, it's a party game at heart.
(-) Not much variety in the base game. Expansions do exist.

I'd rather play Catacombs for a dexterity dungeon crawl.  Dungeon Fighter has some cute dexterity elements, but no tactics or strategy.  So, it's a neat concept but not really a proper game.  The issue is that the board never becomes cluttered or altered -- every throw is the same (except for the rarely-triggered special power) -- there is no emergent complexity of situational variety.

The dexterity part works. What I don't get is the strategy to deal more damage consistently. Bosses with high life totals make it seem the only strategy is to acumulate white dice and that's it...

This is a pure party one and cannot be seen as a serious game. Unfortunately and although my group normally enjoys games like that "Dungeon Fighter" failed in the eyes of my friends.

Hilarious dexterous co-op. I love that it's making fun of the dungeon crawl genre--you'll notice that I don't have any other dungeon crawling games in mu collection; I think the theme's trite at this point, only enjoy playing it as a mockery. But this, this is raw hilarity...as long as you can overcome some guys' fears around touching other men's hands (golden sword of friendship, looking at you). Sigh. Homophobia, you're a bitch, you strike guys I would least expect. One friend went so far as refusing to play, calling it a 'game for couples'. He's a good guy, but seriously: what an ass.

I like to play on hard so that we lose usually, it's better when these bumbling fools who are not heroes get their just deserts and die in the dungeon--or succeed from pure dumb stubborn luck. One of my favorite games--I just have to look at Randolph's picture to start cackling with laughter. Great with booze and ex-D&Ders who get right into it.

I've got mixed feelings on this one. I love dexterity games, almost as a rule, but this one is just a bit too difficult. The amount of damage the enemies do is too high compared to your overall health, I feel.

I won't do the game justice, but that's it before I have an opportunity to learn it by myself. With rare exceptions I don't find co-ops interesting. That's one problem. Second one is maybe the rules explanation I've gotten wasn't so good. 

But I can imagine this being fun and interesting with a bunch of people who know each other and are in the proper mood (would work even as a drinking game). Novelty level is high and attractive. Probably better if people decide to buy those weird weapons with extra drawbacks (we didn't and we lost). 

Edit: rating down because - seems half finished. Visuals to read. Rules need be streamlined.

Fun (ish) and good for a laugh. If you are looking for a serious game turn and run away. It is difficult to hit the target without practice and that can be a bit frustrating if you are taking it too serious. i recognize practice and skill are the point in a dexterity game, but chances are you wont create a league for this game (hopefully) and for a quick impromptu game night your friends wont be good even if you did practice.

Seems like it would move pretty quickly once you're experienced, and also is challenging even on the easy level for newbies, which means there is plenty of room for having gaining skill through practice and trying it on harder levels.

This is best played with 4 or more people.  It is also very easy to make a drinking game out of this or to go into this game already having a few drinks.

This game is pretty fun and unique in my opinion.  You basically bounce dice off of the table onto the board which is target shaped and the closer the die lands to the bullseye, the more damage you will do to a monster.  You travel through dungeon rooms encountering monsters every time your party moves, but some monsters (and equipment) have certain rules that make bouncing the die more challenging.  Overall, it is fun and you need the right group to enjoy it with you, but I would not recommend playing solo.

Busted this out at a party one night and it fell flat. We didn't dislike the game, but nobody particularly liked it either. One of the comments was that it felt neat as a one-time experience but was very gimmicky. I sort of agree and expect to be trading this away in the future.

Some of the dice-throwing combinations don't seem to have been play tested too well. What's up with the catapult shot? There's no way you can bend the card enough to fling the dice without damaging the card!

I was so excited for this game from the moment I heard about it.  I didn't have a dexterity game in my collection and everything about this one seemed great.  Rolling dice in creative ways to hit a target sounds like a lot of fun, I love rolling dice!  The theme was a great boon to me.  I love the goofy rulebook full of jokes.  The art is attractive, stylish, and also goofy.

Yes, I read about how difficult it is but everyone who said it was difficult also said they had a great time and that's what I thought I was in for.  Fun even in the face of inevitable defeat.

Our first game came after no practice so everybody just dove in the deep end and we got creamed...on the easiest difficulty.  The first monster was an under the leg shot that threatened to KO the whole party.  The first monster!  We eventually recovered and got wiped on the first room on the second floor.  Like I said, I thought it would be hard.  But I didn't think it would be so hard we seemingly made no progress.  Our last two monsters had no special rolling instructions so we were still missing with the normal bounce shot.  I can't even imagine trying to combine some of the shots for a hit.

Now I get it, with practice this would get easier.  This was our first game and we didn't even practice the basic bounce shot before jumping in.  The problem is after getting brutalized this bad I think it is going to be hard to get the game to the table again for us to get better at it.  It was suggested that this be more of a party game but unfortunately just the theme would put a lot of people off of it before the box even opened.  It falls into that weird space where it is more of a fun party activity but the board game elements and theme would scare non-gamers away.

I only gave it one play and maybe my friends will surprise me and let me pull it out somewhat often so we can hone our skills so I'm not going to abandon it just yet.  I really, REALLY want to like this game but right now my feelings are still too hurt.

I'm able to get people into this more often than I initially thought and with repeat plays skill does increase and the game isn't as punishing.  Still very difficult to win (We have 1 win on the easiest difficulty with 2 players and liberal practice of each new shot before the "real shot") but it's a little more fun knowing that we are getting better and actually hitting the target with some consistency.

I've since decided I'm not really a fan of playing dexterity games.  I like the idea of them but when I actually sit down and play they never turn out like I want them to and they almost always leave me disappointed.

RATING: 7
A light, dexterity dungeon-crawl consisting of a series of battles resolved by throwing dice at a target in a manner somewhat reminiscent of Tumblin' Dice; hitting closer to the centre deals more damage. Some monsters impose handicaps (throw with your eyes closed, throw while jumping in the air), and some equipment allows voluntary handicaps for bonus damage. There are also items and special abilities.

Components are nice, with some overproduced weirdness (tower to store cards in?) and fantastic artwork.

It's a good game, but [i]hard[/i]. Really, really hard. Some handicaps seem almost impossible, like jumping in the air and spinning. That said, the difficulty does provide a reason to keep coming back: like a [url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard]Nintendo-hard[/url] videogame, winning is very satisfying.

RATING: 7
Fun with a high silliness factor. The game is all about bouncing dice onto a "target" board. Different weapons, monsters and rooms require different odd dice tosses - like bouncing it off your forehead. Some of these are very confusing as to what you are supposed to do, but it's a co-op (and silly), so you just guess and have fun. Very challenging; takes a lot of skill to manage the tricky bounces.

Wacky dexterity game which loses it's appeal quickly with each play. It is also a very hard sell. For every one person in your group who likes it, likely another will flat out hate it.

The game quickly turns from laugh out loud fun, to completely frustrating. If you are playing on a table you will spend more time picking up dice from off the floor.

The special shots are impossible and make the game even more frustrating. They ultimately ruin the game. Even the standard shot is hard enough depending on what type of surface you're playing on.

I really love the campy artwork and theme. The idea is great, it's just the game expects way too much from you with it's insane shot requirements. 

You may think the game sounds fun, and it is for the first play or 2, But from there it just becomes tedious and frustrating.

Difficult to play well, but surprisingly engrossing. There's a good number of laughs in the game too, but it would perhaps benefit from more variety in what the monsters do as an attack and perhaps they could do more than just carry gold, but these are basically minor quibbles.

I've played this alone, with my 3 and 7 year old nephews, with gamers, and with friends, and I had a fun time every game.  You have to practice a few rolls first, for sure, but it's enjoyable and wacky. The worst time I had was with serious gamers - they wanted the hardest version of it as a first attempt, and we had scars aplenty after one monster. UPDATE: Still have a blast every time I play this, win or lose.  I'd say it might be my favorite game, with its combination of dexterity, strategy, and humor. Bosses are just ridonkulous though - serious house rules needed before facing the bosses.

First Impression:

Talk about a dungeon crawler!

Take all the theme of a dungeon crawler, make a lot of fun of it and add a dexterity minigame (or should I say megagame) instead of simple lame dice rolling. That's dungeon fighter. It doesn't lose weapons, potions, special abilities, a myriad of monsters, choose your path etc from the core of dungeon crawlers, it just replaces the dice rolling with the - a lot more fun - dice throwing. 

It's silly refreshing and very enjoyable! And you could say it's only skill, though that's obviously not its point.

A co-op party game that has a little of a lot of different things: the need for dexterity, planning with a team, and a lot of luck, which all comes together well. Since you (sort of) get used to most of the crazy dice-rolling methods after a few tries, or at least decide which ones will really give you trouble, the biggest obstacle to overcome is usually how well the dice bounce on your table. Difficulty can vary wildly depending on what special die throws the monsters require.

I guess if you really like Dark Souls (the videogame) then you will enjoy this. It's a game for people who love to be punished for not being great at bouncing a plastic die off of a table (in a variety of ways) and making it land on a piece of cardboard. 

Everything else is fine but the throwing mechanic makes for absurd difficulty spikes. 

The only way I'd play it again is if they changed the throwing mechanic completely.

if u don't like cooperative games or dexterity games you will probably don't like it.
otherwise, it is a very very very funny game because you don't roll dices the usual way. you must land it in specific places, after specific requirements and throwing in in every possible way... and this is very stupid but very funny and entertaining! besides, cards have funny names , components are good and the mechanic is not so simple because you have to use dice wisely, choosing the best color to use, how to correctly spend money and so on.

Yes, Dungeon Fighter is a fun distraction for a while. But after a few games it gets a bit dull. I wouldn't even say it's the novelty of aiming your dice onto a target because who doesn't love that (am I riiight)? I just think it's too damn hard! Even on the easiest setting, you'll find yourself getting clobbered by one particular monster game after game because you can't roll the dice off your nose. And other throws are just impossible! This has all the potential of a brilliant drinking game but with the amount of frustration involved, it sobers you up pretty quickly.

Really, really cute cooperative dungeon crawling game. But really more of a party game than anything that resembles strategy.  The dexterity challenges the game demands are a little annoying- I don't really want to have to "practice" my acrobatic die rolls just in order to have a chance at winning the game.  But I think I will bring it out again for play with my D&D group before our marathon campaign.

An amazing, unique dice throwing dexterity game that is too difficult for the casual "party" crowd it should otherwise serve.  I suspect a lot of practice will make it much more accessible, but this isn't the type of game you'd normally GET a lot of practice at.  A flawed GEM.  We play it now with an easier mix of cards and that makes it better!

Really like this game in a party-style group, or change the pace of a game night. Easy to explain (where you can just explain the rules as they come up or become required), easy for people to get into as it's dexterity based and good silly fun. Certainly benefits from having a group of 4 or more, due to social dynamics that makes the game fun for me: cheering for a well performed trick-shot or boasting to be able to make some complicated trick-shot, which aren't that interesting when you play with only 1 other person.

I also like that this game is easy to set up and doesn't take a lot of time to play. About 45 minutes seems a nice timeslot to throw in while waiting for people to arrive or finish a game.

Might not be the best game for you if you have pets to will try to eat anything that falls onto the ground... some dice might get missing and might require a vet to help you poor furry pal.

I can see where some people can get into the silly of that... but I'd rather play Safranito which has more game or Coconuts which is both fast and more fun for this sort of thing.

I don't like the dexterity part of this game. Which really is the whole game. Maybe it's because my dexterity is -2

Lots of fun and laughs with this game! It's a cooperative dexterity game (there aren't many around) that makes you cheer at every silly throw of die. There is not much strategy in this game, but nevertheless it keeps your attention during the entire play!

This has got to be the single most difficult dexterity game I have every played. How to summarize… OK. Cross the skillful propelling of cubic dice from [thing=16747][/thing] with dungeon crawl and targeting of [thing=57390]Catac[/thing]— no, that's not right. Well, I'll just say that it is very warped, and you'd better practice using your "weapons" (the RGB dice) before you play. Then you might survive the first foe.

This is a quick and painful game, but in a fun way.

This game is surprisingly hard. It was fun, but there are only so many ways you can make throwing dice at a target interesting before I tire of it.

Dumbest game ever. Such a waste of amazing artwork and production values. I guess this was a reminder to not buy stuff from your FLGS just because the box is pretty and the game seems like silly fun. We never got through the first room because of the nonsense of needing to throw the dice under your leg, headbutt it and then have it bounce once on the table before landing on the target. Good luck with that. Will keep it just to have a card with a "Pussy Demon" on it. lol.

Thoroughly enjoy it, but you have to realize you will not always win.

Besides...it is not about winning rather the contortions you get into to throw the dice!

The dungeon board cards are a bit small and underwhelming.
The characters are some of the funniest I have ever seen in any other game.
How can you go wrong when the skill of your character depends on your actual skill at rolling a die at a bulls eye while aiming through your legs with your back to the board?

very good party game. a bit too much stuff on it, so it gets fiddly and that's not good for a this type of game

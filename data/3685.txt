FREEEEDOOOOMMM! My 2nd favorite block game at the moment (after Sekigahara), and one that is fairly great gateway (much more than its much tauted brother Richard III), albeit a bit long for the first few plays.

RATING: 6
A great Christmas present from 2004. UPDATE: Finally sat down to my first try at HotS. The first game was not finished, but I can already tell that I'm going to love this one! The 'fog of war' thing is like Stratego on steroids, the wintering rules change it up enough to keep it interesting... what a game! It's the next step up from Memoir and Battle Cry in my mind. I played my first full game a while later and was completely destroyed. I loved it! UPDATE: It's funny, I never play this one anymore. I don't really play any of my war-oriented games lately. UPDATE: traded for the 40k 4th ed rulebook.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.9
HotS is a block wargames classic.
A little bit of strategy, a little bit of tactics + lots of fun with a fair ammount of luck involving dicerolling. Play time just about right. 
One issue that I have is that it seems to get a bit repetitive after a few plays.

My first block game.

Activations by cards and the usual combat system (a-b-c-d) with a innovative management of Scottish factions makes this title one of the best of Columbia.

Playing time: around 2 to 3 hours
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Rating based on 4 plays of the 3rd edition Braveheart scenario so far.
Components [7/10] - Typical Columbia box, excellent artwork on the map, cards are ok but artwork could have been better by dropping the Columbia logo and adding flavor text, map works best with plexi.  Wood blocks and stickers are good quality with nice artwork.  Player aids would have been nic as would a battle board although a couple nice battle boards are available on BGG.
Cost [8/10] - Seems a little high.
History/Theme [17/20] - Some historical notes are included in the rulebook and the asymmetry of the way the two sides play adds the theme of the game.  A more detailed history of the period would have been nice, even if just a couple pages.
Strategy [10/10] - Excellent strategy component to this game.  Feels a little like Stratego and Chess, with a card activation component added to increase the tension and decision points.
Fun Factor [10/10] - Excellent, fun, tense game.  Seems well balanced - last game came down to the last battle which went all 3 rounds..
Replayability [10/10] - Many different options to try and the card variability keeps it interesting.
Length [8/10] - Likely 2-3 hours which seems a little long but not horrible..
Intangibles [20/20] - Very fun and thought provoking game.  A game where you do a lot of thinking about what your next move will be - and then often watch your plan go up in smoke when the opponent plays a truce card when you play one of your few movement cards. Rules are decent, a few FAQs but most have been ironed out in the 3rd edition.

Overall: [90/100] = 90.0%

Really enjoyed the game. Played one time and had a blast. Not too difficult, but still very challenging. I would like to see more plays. It seems to me that the British player has a hard time holding on to the Northern nobles. If the Scottish player can sweep through the North, that will give him the count needed to win. If he can then hold on to the bottleneck (use Wallace and his infantry to take it) by piling your armies there and then dispersing them with the last card (to avoid wintering problems), then the British cannot break through. I would like to see it played more to test the theory out. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Faster to setup than Julius Caesar of the same series of games and either side does come out thematically true with the problems of suppressing a revolt and trying to run one against a superior force. The nobles turning sides too is very much in theme. Long term planning is rewarded too with its area control of areas that can winter bigger armies.

Downside is that luck can play a factor in a major battle with the dice.

Divertido, como todos los de bloques con esa niebla de guerra. Con esa sutileza táctica de los dados, donde las batallas son más importantes que las estrategias y donde la superioridad táctica y de opción es muy importante. Este tipo de sistema es muy bueno para usar en épocas preindustriales, en las que las guerras se decidían por batallas concretas y no existían frentes más o menos estables, si no bandas de hombres armados.
 Ideal para introducir en el mundo de los wargames a no iniciados.

RATING: 8.5
Simple and solid block-wargame with cards, but not card driven "à la GMT", and with a good medieval atmosphere.
Wallace is a very powerful A3 unit and could convert a lot of enemy nobles before the english player could stop him.
The core mechanic (cards, ABC blocks, area activation, retreat, regroup, supply values etc) has been used for a lot of sequent games (Crusader Rex, Liberty, Julius Caesar, Richard III, GMT's Hellenes...)

Un gran juego táctico y un ligero "toque" estratégico que sin duda pondrá a prueba vuestras mejores habilidades. Componentes de calidad muy similar al juego de la misma editorial "Julius Caesar", con el que comparte prácticamente la misma estructura en cuanto a la secuencia de juego, pero con suficientes novedades y detalles que harán de este juego un juego totalmente diferente, y todo un reto para los amantes de la táctica. Todas mis impresiones sobre el juego las tenéis en la vídeo reseña que he hecho sobre él:

Nicely asymmetric. I think I have enough light Columbia games. Having played Julius Caesar, Richard III, Athens vs Sparta, and Crusader Rex (2e), this felt a little samey. Though I do realise I have it backwards, I just happened to come to this one last. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A very interesting wargame that mimics the flow and swing of the era's battles and political uncertainties. 

The play of cards, the wintering, the coronations, the change in allegiance of nobles add to the flavour on a simple system that runs nothing more than the usual D6 to hits.

The dice raise the level of 'uncontrolled uncertainty' that is typical to lots of Wargames. Nevertheless the dice system makes this game flow faster and do not bog down on chart flipping.

A wargame that is above all averages.

Great block game and one where the blocks really make the game. This would be an entirely different game if the pieces were counters that both players could see. The hidden piece element layers a cat-n-mouse mechanism over the game which raises it up a notch. Solid game that works well as a conflict oriented euro or a wargame. Fairly easy to teach and play and doesn't have a lot of rules. Use the latest version of the rules - 3.0

A very good light-wargame with an excellent amount of uncertainty in each game: nothing is ever guaranteed! There are a few aspects which might generate in-game results which are historically questionable; but to have the degree of simulation any more complex would probably mean a sacrifice of the delicious uncertainty, which is what really makes this such a great game.


After Sekigahara, this really would be the perfect gateway game to get a eurogamer into wargaming!

My only complaint concerns the game's historical notes. They emphasize the glorious struggle of the oppressed Scots for freedom, when it was really in so many ways a civil war between different factions of Scottish nobles; so much so that rather than calling it the War of Scottish Independence, one could quite legitimately call it the War of the Scottish Succession! Then, there's the "Braveheart" scenario, about William Wallace's campaign. In actual fact, the Braveheart was Robert the Bruce, whose heart was posthumously taken by his companions with them on a Crusade.

I love this game. The game is very well balanced (even if it doesn't seem like it at first) and plays brilliantly into the theme.

The Scots were outnumbered against the might of the English army (and being Scottish I'm loathe to admit that!) and so the game seems in favour of the English player who starts each round with more blocks than the Scottish player. In this, the English player can "hammer the Scots" player seemingly quite easily. But the secret to the Scots players victory is carefully outmanoeuvring his opponent, choosing his or her battles carefully and taking advantage of the border limits.

A brilliantly designed game and the fog of war aspect just adds to the tension.

RATING: 5
First, the good points. Quite a lot of thematic flavour is packed into a pretty simple package.  The asymmetrical warfare is nicely represented, with the English juggernaut constantly seeking to engage the enemy and able to absorb casualties, while the Scots use guerrilla tactics and must pick their fights very carefully.  

The action point cards throw up some interesting decisions, though a bad hand can see you at best treading water for a turn.  I like the fog of war provided by the blocks.  It is not as opaque as I'd feared.  The heraldic labels for the blocks are nice, though some were a devil to get off their backing.

Having paid all those compliments, I have to say that I just don't enjoy the game very much.  As others have commented, it often seems to boil down to the Scots building up in the Highlands, while the English subjugate the south. The major battles are fought in Lennox, Mentieth and up the east coast. Hence, I feel that strategically HotS holds very little interest.  

The rules describe some quite novel concepts and could have been clearer, with more examples.  The omission of a shield from the second edition map was not clever. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Fun and very fast playing. Few blocks, lots of play options. A typical example of less is more. In short this game is a mini-revolution.

With the cards you'll have to make priorities. The outcome of cards played are often surprising. Blocks are personalized, which adds flavor to the game.

Maps & cards are in good shape; Cards are sleeved, which kept the wear to a minimum (there is a lot of shuffling in this game). Box shows some wear, but the outer sleeve is in great shape (as I usually store the Columbia box sleeves separate from the black inner box), to keep it looking good on the shelf.

RATING: 7
A really good block game by Columbia Games. No doubt about it.

But after having tested both Richard III and Julius Ceasar, I've come to the conclusion that Hammer is kinda outdated.

I say this because it is very easy for a match to end up with both English and Scottish armies piling up at the middle of the map. And that tends to happen quite often (at least on my many solo plays).

You don't see that kind of physical bottleneck driving the matches of RIII and JC, which have more "open" maps.

Hammer of the Scots is a solid design, but I feel that its publishing company has improved the gaming experience in subsequent games.

Plus, I have an issue with the possibility of combatants to leave battle at the first round. In subsequent games, it can't be done and, IMO, it makes for more interesting engagements.

In summary, Hammer will be in my collection for the time being for its "classic feel", but the other block games will hit the table more often.

A great CDG/block game mix, with specific goals for both sides that offer wonderfully horrible strategic choices. I've played many times and wants more.

This was my first block war game and I really liked it.  It's a great system that simulates fog of war and easily tracks damage.

Besides being a well-designed game, this is a good place to start because it's not as complex and lengthy as other games of the genre.

What I really liked is how different the two sides play and require very different strategies.  The Brits generate lots of troops but have trouble moving them and maintaining them over the winter.  The Scots have less -- except for a few power units -- and need to stay mobile and choose their battles carefully.

RATING: 7
My first foray into Block Gaming.  Wasn't too bad.  We played the first scenario, I believe.  Or at least we tried to.  Turn 1, my opponent had King Edward, he moved him adjacent to me by some boat event card while i attacked elsewhere.  Turn 2, he attacked me with everything.  I never had a chance to even win the scenario.

Regardless, I don't think the game itself is the problem, just luck of the draw.  The mechanics are nice, and makes keeping track of the strengths and abilities of your units easy.  Altogether not too bad, but I'll need more experience with this game to rate it any higher.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Perfect amount of unit chrome.  Spartan production, but worth the price.  Be sure to get some card sleeves, though.  Crusdader Rex has been known to strike me as a better game right after I play it, but I always want to play Hammer more in general.  The theme alone could be keeping the torch lit for me, but the game is great too.  I'm always wanting the opponent and the time for this one, but thinking about it is unusually pleasant too.

This little game is well deserving of its reputation as a top notch game.  The components overall are okay (the blocks are nice, the unmounted board is less so).  Where the game excels is in design.  A wonderfully assymetric feel leads the Scots player to employ different strategies from the British.  The taciturn nobles switching sides is very well executed.  Game balance is surprisingly tight.  The net result is an outstanding block game.

First play, mananged to win a battle killing Wallace, and 4 of his nobles, leaving my opponent with one noble.  Fun, but not a lot of units unlike say EastFront.  I really like block games, and enjoyed this one.  With the nobles switching sides, it plays very different than other block games.

Was initially won over by this game. Unique subject, solid Columbia block system, nicely produced etc.

However, as I've played it more, its strategic shallowness has become apparent. Play can often become mired in an attritional back and forth, making the game feel like WWI in circa 1300 AD Scotland. Crusader Rex, with balance issues sorted, is a more interesting game.

None the less, a good, fun introductory wargame.

Almost no game I can think of has the same ebb and flow that Hammer of the Scots has.  There always seems to be moments in the game where one player is poised to completely obliterate the opposition -- only to find the tables turned within moments.

Euro gamers shouldn't be afraid to give this block wargame a look.

The card reshuffle after every turn kills it for me. That and the fact that I am horrible at this game. But the card reshuffle is a joke. You already have the randomness of dice, why add more?  I challenge anyone to have fun when you draw a bunch of 1's two or three turns in a row, esp. as the English.  I have other problems with it, but no point in going on - I'm permanently done with it. Shame, too, b/c I really wanted to like this one.

RATING: 7
A skótok harca az angolok ellen, a "Rettenthetetlen" korából. A tábla eltér a szokott társasjáték tábláktól: kb. mintha egy atlaszból lenne kimásolva a domborzati térkép:) Plusz még néhány címer és határvonal van rajta. A kövek szépek, igényesek. A doboz egyedi, sajnos kicsit jobban kopik, mint a játékok többségénél megszokott fajtájú papír, de a külső borítás ezt orvosolja. Ami meglepett, hogy 2. kiadás létére is elég nagy bakit követtek el a táblán, az egyik címer lemaradt, és egy kártyán mellékelve van a dobozban, mondván ragasszuk a táblára:)

Ez az első klasszikus értelemben vett háborús játék, amivel játszottam, bár azok közül még az egyszerűbbek közé sorolják. Nekem azért ajánlották, hogy ne ugorjak egyből olyan mély vízbe, mint az Europe Engulfed, ami szintén blokkos háborús játék, hanem melegítsek be ezzel, mert ez ebben a műfajban bevezető játéknak számít. Állítólag. Ehhez képest a szerzők itt is megpróbálták egészen élethűen lemodellezni az adott kort (az Engulfedben ez állítólag sokkal aprólékosabban jelentkezik), a kövek jó részének külön története van, és ebből fakadóan speciális szabályok kötődnek hozzájuk. A sok apró szabály ellenére is elég egyszerű a játékmenet.

Stratégiai játékokhoz viszonyítva már egy ilyen alap háborús játéknál is nagyon kifinomult a csaták lefolyása, annak ellenére, hogy kockával döntjük el őket. És meglepően sok infó fér el egy-egy kis kövön.

A véleményem: a játék nagyon szerethető, mert a kor maga is érdekes, ha valaki csak a Rettenthetetlen c. filmet látta, már akkor is nagyon sok név visszaköszön számára. Szépek a kövek, nagyon kevés kellék van, áttekinthető a játék. A gondunk csak az volt, hogy valamit rosszul játszhattunk, mert a skótok elképesztően nagy hátrányban voltak végig. Ezért újra ki kell majd próbálnunk. De a felemás próbálkozás ellenére is megér a játék 8 pontot.
---
Újabb menet után: Nagyon jó játék! Továbbra is esélyesebbnek gondolom az angolokat, de volt a skótoknak is esélye. Néhány kör alatt letisztult a tábla, északon csak a skótok, délen csak az angolok maradtak. Kicsin múlt, az 5. kör tájékáig a skótok folyamatosan erősödtek, de néhány rossz döntés és némi balszerencse megfordította a tendenciát...
---
Végre nyertek a skótok:) A mai után az a konklúzió, hogy inkább az angolok az esélytelenebbek. Ki érti ezt...

Initial Impression: Solid entry using Columbia Games' "ABC" system. Enough tweaks that make this a very thematic game about the struggle it portrays. Cardplay is similar to other games using the system. Both sides play asymmetrically. My worry is that the game feels a bit too scripted and most battles will take place in the same few areas throughout the game.

RATING: 7
One of the better block wargames and I particularly like the fact that all the Scottish nobles can switch from the Scottish side to the English side (as apparently happened historically).

The two downsides of the game are that after repeated playing various broad stroke strategies tend to dominate (based around the appearance or otherwise of Ed I) and that the outcome of the game is often determined in a massive dice-fest battle in closing stages of the game (I have found a number of block-games have this problem). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A well researched and developed game. Fun and not too rules heavy; no two sessions will likely be the same. Harder than it looks for the English to win even though it seems they should crush the Scots. Enough extras, variations and "chrome" to keep you coming back for more games.

After many plays I have ended up appreciating this game, one that has a surprising amount of tactical play. The 3d edition with the redone map is my favorite. This was Columbia's original CDG and it simplest. I actually like subsequent games better, like Crusader Red, because the additional complexity of sieges for example add to the historical immersion.

RATING: 9
Great game, as far as games go, but largely too dependent on luck.  With good cards and die rolls, you can wipe the board.  If you fall behind early, you can rarely catch up.  Victory goes to player blessed by fortuna.  However, it is kinda fun to be on short end of stick.  I once played Scots with Brit having King all repeat all but last two turns.  I survived with 5 nobles.  And I rubbed it in. . . . =0)  So, if you're willing to play a game where luck determines whether you're playing to win or playing not to lose, then this isn't so bad after all.  It can be fun, I guess, from either perspective.  But don't kid yourself.  If you wipe the board, it's becasue you're lucky, not because you're good.

RATING: 5
First play. Suprised BGG profile of this game doesn't include 'dice' within the mechanics. Because dice are a big part of this game which make it more like Risk and less like Diplomacy. Production quality is disapointing, the board is very flimsy card stock and the cards have a home made feel to them. The wooden pieces are nice though. The secret element of the game is not so secret seeing how the set up is always the same and someone with an average memory shouldn't really struggle to remember what points are on the table.

Needs a second play to consolidate the rules and strategies but I am initially unimpressed by the luck quota dealt by the dice and the card draw and subsequently I'm surprised by the high ranking given on BGG. This game better be a diamond in the rough, otherwise I can see mine appearing on E-Bay pretty sharpish after play #2.

Sold on E-Bay, it's rubbish.

Just did not click for me (though I wanted it to). Seemed like kind of a dice-fest. I thought the hidden blocks would create lots of interesting situations, but these never materialized, or if they did, I was too disinterested to notice. Maybe it was the historical period, though I doubt it as this is interesting history. I did not think the game led to any immersion or illuminated any political or marshal dynamics of the period. Perhaps I am not a block war gamer. Whatever it was...it did not grab me :( 

Sold.

I certainly want to play a few more games of this though it will be hard to get on the table as its a two-player wargame. Two players compete to control Scotland, determined by controlling more of the fourteen fickle families that rule the country. These Noble families can be controlled by seizing their territory or by defeating them in battle.
The game resembles other block games, which are essentially just pretty versions of old hex and counter games. However, this one has some very unusual rules which take a little bit of time to get your head round - not least of which is the notion of defecting units.

4/08I'm excited to play this one, love the time period and topic.We had a fun time w/ this one, Longshanks pushed the Scots back to the north, but could not kill Wallace, who kept popping up at all of the battles with surprising resilience. But in the end, Wallace could not win enough noble support and the English subdued Scotland 10-3 with Moray deceased...

What a great game!  Small number of pieces yet a really deep and fun game.  Fog of war element with blocks makes it challenging to find Wallace or Edward and keeps the game fresh.  Card play element forces players to think in terms of grand strategy as well as the more operational movement of the various nobles.  Really elegant design.

Didn't do it for me.  Maybe I don't know enough about the topic, but the game felt very abstract to me.  I was very aware of the mechanics, never got sucked into the story.  Immersion is a quality I really want in a game, was happy to trade this one away.

Fun, interesting game.  Schiltroms MAY be unnecessary, and bad luck in dice or card draws can be frustrating.  Instituted a rule where certain hands allow you to redraw.  Poor quality components compared to a lot of modern games, though.

There seems to be a very strong incentive to hold a central province, which is kind of lame.

Sold it because I'd rather play Hannibal (and Hannibal has better components.)

Well the verdict is in on this game. After 10 plays I've decided not to purchase this one. This is mostly because I own alot of block games and my group has at least 4 copies floating around.

I like Richard the III better with only 4 plays and feel it is the better game for me.

Straightforward 2 player block game, with an element of luck involved with the card draws, but still sufficient skill is required to make a difference over the long term.

Some neat rules to determine which blocks are available and which are not at certain times, for both England and Scotland and a strong area control element make this a good battle of wits. 

This is definitely one that I want to play again soon, it's easy to learn but tougher to master. 

I would sugget playing a game (solo if necessary) to get to grips with the rules as it seemed much simpler to understand with the game being played out in front of me.

Great game!!

Classic block game that has some nice FAQs etc on the Columbia website that really ansrer all of the questions etc that come with playing the game.

14 Nobles of Scotland ask Edward I to come and resolve fuedal quarrels and you get the setting for a nifty blck wargame.  Now theyre aligned with the English and slowly they trickle to the Scots.

With two minor scenarios that clock in around a couple hours (once you know the rules) and a campaign--there is some options for changing it up.  Having seen the second and third edition I actually prefer the simple utility of the second.

Interesting ideas here, but my first attempt to play this game with another newbie just dragged.  Ran into lots of rules questions, and we eventually abandoned the game.  

Second play was much smoother, but I was able to dominate as the English, winning in the 2nd or 3rd turn.  I suspect that there may be more of a learning curve for the Scottish player, as it seemed too easy for me to win.  Or maybe we were playing some of the rules incorrectly.  

Preliminary rating of 6, based on the above plays (both on VASSAL).

(4 plays) Wow, what a great game! It's not as light as some of the comments may suggest, but you should have the rules down after one game. Our first game took us about 4 hrs, but we both are slow players. The game time will be less than 3 hrs after repeated plays.

Although I rated this game a seven after my first play, it may go up after more plays.

These games were actually engaging, with interesting decisions, both tactical and strategic. However, the dealing of the five cards at the beginning of each turn could be frustrating. A player could be very limited in actions by a bad deal. I have gotten only three cards allowing one move, with two special cards, which don't always provide much of an advantage. Nice bits and all, though the paper board was annoying sometimes. I just got frustrated at the card play, which could sometimes severely hamper any meaningful play for a whole season if the randomly selected action/movement cards were insufficient for meaningful choices in a turn. So traded this neat looking game away.

This is a solid 7, enjoyable game. It does take a little too long, especially the campaign, which sadly is the most enjoyable scenario. Also, as with games of its ilk, replayability is somewhat lacking as optimal strategies manifest themselves.

A very solid game, with depth of play and strategy. A very good re-enactment of the English vs. Scottish. One feels the tug of war on the nobles as the game conveys it well.

Update: 8 -> 6 revisited this game 4.5 years later, and it was disappointing. An onerous ordeal to be England's whipping boy for 5 hours. Plain o' not fun to play Scotland. Not sure I want to invest that length of time to discover how to play the Scots. While it is appreciable that it recreates the historical nature of the imbalance between England and Scotland, I'm not sure that it translates to a balanced game to play for both sides. And secondly, being the Scots and randomly receiving 5 crappy cards most of the time and rolling high doesn't exactly help the experience.

In my only play of this I got destroyed as the Scots. This is a very unforgiving game but is really a seminal title in many ways, so I grabbed it when it became available. Unsure how often I'll actually play it, when I have Athens/Sparta, Julius Caesar, and Liberty using the same system.

Update:  I really enjoyed this game, plenty of think about, the system forces you to look ahead and plan for the upcoming winters.  I like it.  Also, the rules are not overly complex, so the game can play quite quickly when players are focused on their actions, a very interesting game with a myriad of choices and options every turn.  You always want to be able to do more than you can, yet there is a balance between adding enough force, and adding too much, as the wintering limits are vital - a very tense and enjoyable challenge!

A tense, tactical game with a great fog of war effect.

Played my first couple of games recently with the wife. Rules were easy enough to understand and explain. Very fun game. She actually suggested that we leave it set up to play again, so clearly it went over well. It fulfills my meatier strategy game itch. 

Update - After playing a ton, HotS has turned into one of my all time favorite games. There is just sooo much tension as you try to figure out what your opponent will do each turn. Will they play a high card, should you play a low card so you can re-act, can you play risk the year ending in case you both play an event. Lot's of things to think about here and lots of fun!

When you step away from this game, it begins to grow on you a bit more.  The best sign of this game is that I wanted to give it another shot as the other side.  It has an interesting snapback effect, and even though I'm not a fan of the dice, I'm a fan of the gimmick this one adds to block games.

My first block wargame. The setup seems to favor England, but we'll see how it goes with more playings. I think the optional rules might help balance things, like bidding for the right to play England in numbers of years before Edward is added to the draw pool. Noble home defense bonuses and schiltroms also help a lot with the game balance. Whenever I play with my wife, we have one extra house rule that nobles returning home to find an enemy block do not immediately defect, but rather fight a battle before wintering.

[9/10/2006] HotS (v2 rules) provides a broadbrush picture of Scotland's 13th/14th century Wars of Independence, succeeds in confronting both sides' with the respective challenges they faced and making such asymetrical warfare tremendous fun. This was effectively a civil war and warfare revolves round this underlying political dimension (noble loyalties).

The action point budget and uncertainty provided by the cards strikes me as far more important than the fog of war element provided by the blocks (which is somewhat mitigated by the winter home leave factor). Nonetheless, it spices up the game and emphasizes guerrilla-style warfare.One criticism I have is that the game all-too-often sees the Bravehearts consolidating their power base in the north, while the Sassenachs do the same in the south. This tends to lead to both sides facing each other in mid-Scotland and leaves less scope for dramatic manoeuvre warfare. This all hinges on how viable/strong one considers a Scottish Lowland/Southern strategy. I just happen to be skeptical of the designer's confidence in the attractiveness of the Lowland strategy considering the risks involved. Perhaps I'll come up with some variant rules providing further incentives for both sides to play for areas further away from their respective power bases.

On another note, map quality does not meet professional standards. The underlying map is too pixelish. IMO, Columbia Games ought to tap the talent of their games' fans, who've already submitted some stylish work.   HotS is such a terrific game and clearly deserves a better map.

A pure fun wargame with simple rules. I love that each side is faced with a different set of challenges and puzzles.  My 1st game came down the wire.  "Braveheart" scenario seems incredibly balanced.  At first it looked easy for the English, then things changed and it looked the Scots would drop the hammer.  In the end it came to one battle to decide the whole thing. Fog of war is great.  Theres plenty of luck with cards and dice but things seem to even out and none of the hands seemed particularly crippling. May go up with more plays.

ADDED-Wow this game is so tight!  This is the second time I've played where it came down to the last card of the last year.  As the Scots, I was thinking I was lost all game and then I pulled it out in the last battle.  Such amazing play balance is an art!  Columbia fan for life!  Each side plays very differently as well.  Balance, asymmetry, with just enough period chrome to still feel wargamey.  The perfect simple wargame!

Great game.  Dice do play a role, and card luck definitely has it's day, but war itself has a significant amount of luck.  This wargame plays to conclusion in less than 3 hours, and allows for a player to make tremendously crushing tactical moves.  The mechanics of the game live and breathe the theme.  The rules are simple, but give tremendous depth to the play in terms of organization and terrain.  If you have read the history of this period of Scotland, you will see it represented well here.  Just a blast to play.  It helps to have your ancestors on both sides of your family represented in the Scottish blocks too:)

It's a good game, but for me, it was too long with too many rules and exceptions. Hated having to continually refer to the rulebook. And there sure is a hell of a lot of luck for a 4 hour game.

RATING: 6
Relatively simple block euro/wargame. The English are strong but have difficulty massing troops for battle each year unless they manage to winter with Edward I (in which case they'll have no reinforcements the next year). The Scots are weaker but occupy a lot of upland areas which are difficult for the English to attack in force. The '1-2-3' rule for the cards (maximum of one '3', two events and three '1's) is well-balanced. The blocks create a nice fog-of-war and the rules for defecting nobles work well and seem true to history. The blocks are nice (there's some great alternative artwork in the photos section) but the map is a bit bland (looks like it came from a school atlas). It's a good game but the dice can play a large part in determining the winner and the rule allowing units to retreat 'through' a battle can be very frustrating.

This is a very fun war game. There is a ton of  intense battles that keep you wanting more. The theme is awesome. Who doesn't like Braveheart? And if that isn't enough to get your blood moving there's Edward the 1st, the warrior King, the hammer of the scots. I love this game but 9 out of 10 times me and my dad play Richard the 3rd. You can't go wrong with either one tho, both great games

RATING: 6
The blocks and hidden information are not as important to this game as you might initially think.  The really interesting thing about this game is that the board resets (everyone goes home to their home territory, or wintering) after every game year and the whole game is played over 10 or so years.  Each side is fighting over control of the nobles of scotland and each winter they MUST return home.  You can win a noble to your side by either beating him in combat outright or controlling his home area when wintering happens.  If the Scots get control of a set number of nobles, then the french army comes to the aid of the scots and the scots can crown a king (which is bad for the English).  Meanwhile, the English common troops have to reset to England every year and make a push into Scotland from the south, unless they draw King Edward from the common units - which is bad for the Scots.  On top of all these neat mechanics - the battle is interesting and simple, and it makes Braveheart (Wallace) very hard to kill outright.  I would like to play again soon.

RATING: 7
Rating is after 2 plays, both times as Scots.  Game is very intriguing, with a lot of back and forth, almost too much.  You sometimes feel like the winner is determined by who plays best/rolls best/gets best cards in the last 2 years.  The prominent use of dice can be disconcerting as well.  But you know what?  It's fun.

HOTS is a relatively straightforward block wargame with each block representing step, strength, and speed. Units are either generic, nobles, or other special types. The nobles provide some of the most interest in the game in that they are not killed in battle, but, instead, are turned to the other side. The win condition (beyond leader elimination) is control of the majority of nobles. This turncoat aspect combined with the fact that the nobles go home to winter forms the core of the game problem. First, nobles that have turned can return home and end up behind enemy lines. Second, nobles that return home can turn if their home is occupied by an enemy unit. Third, the 'returning' aspect puts a premium on non-noble pieces, since they are the only ones that can take and hold a position at year end. Unfortunately, the wintering rules also generate some of the lock-up and congestion that seems to happen in the middle of the board. Terrain and positional considerations don't seem overwhelmingly interesting. The red borders cause things to slow pretty considerably by only allowing passage by two units who must then stop. The black borders allow up to six and have no stopping requirement. This makes the red borders much more defensible, particularly if you can hold a line and not allow multiple approaches. It also makes them difficult to move through if a considerable quantity of troops have massed. Overall, I found it to be a very enjoyable game and give it a generous 8 to start, but I can only imagine it going down, alas, as I discover games with more manuvering and tactical options and more logistical and supply problems. But in the meantime: THEY CAN TAKE OUR LIVES, BUT THEY CANNOT TAKE OUR FREEDOM!

I don't see why this or any of Jerry Talyors designs are so well received. Everyone always praises the action cards, but I myself can't stand them. Unlike in Twilight Struggle, which lets you do up to 5 things with any action card, games in this series only give you one option, which means that all you are really deciding is how to play out the hand that you are dealt, which isn't that great of a decision tree for me.

Still an okay game, though.

I usually can pick up on strategy for games like this pretty quickly...but for some reason Hammer of the Scots have been a semi-painful process to learn. I clearly need to play it more.

After a handful of playings, it feels like the preliminary strategy for the English is pretty scripted: go for the southern nobles and try to do damage control in the north. I need to get past that part and see if the rest of the game is really as engaging as the reputation here indicates. 

In terms of medium weight block games: at the same point in my introduction to Rommel in the Desert I was already completely hooked. The tension level seemed to be cranked up much higher. 

I enjoy the concept of the blocks. I think the recurrent wintering mechanism may actually take away from some of that enjoyment, since a lot of blocks are identified each turn-end when they go back 'home'. I really like that bluffing aspect of requiring an engagement to reveal the make-up of the forces.

The card-play aspect of Hammer introduces some neat mechanisms, but also a huge heaping of luck. With dice rolls, too, this game may be a lot more chaotic than many people are comfortable with. 

To sum up: I think this game is probably slightly over-rated...or maybe just doesn't appeal to me as much as some other similar games. I find the wintering rules to be unintuitive and create a lot of 'gamey' situations that don't feel so much like interesting strategic thinking as much as intrusive chrome.  I definitely need more playings, since I admittedly only have a few. Maybe with the rules mastered, the game will open like a flower and I'll discover what the raving is about. Until then, there are a vast number of other 2p wargames I prefer.

I enjoy the blocks and the history of the game. It has enough tactics and strategy to keep me coming back, but the dice can be brutal in this game. I like the asymmetry as well, both sides feel very different which is probably my favorite thing about wargames. Overall good fun, and lighter(for me) than Hannibal which means it should fill a niche of its own.

One of the best wargames ever designed.  Full of theme, flavor, and a near-perfect mix of realism and abstraction, HotS rewards resourceful play (as opposed to Euro games, which limit options) and is packed to the brim with difficult and risky choices.  Complexity is low but detailed which will likely cause "spielfrieks" some consternation.

I think it's barely okay.  The cards are pretty, and the history lesson in the rulebook is great.  Just not too into block games so far.  My rating is really more of a reflection of my desire to play HotS than it is a measure of its general merit as a game.  Just not a fun one for me.

Hammer of the Scots is the first and only block game I've played, and while I'm still not sold on the block game concept, I did enjoy playing it.

Rules in the 1st edition are tedious to try and figure out, but there is an excellent wargame here. Still a lot of luck involved in this game with the dice, etc. but I don't think it detracts from how good this game is. It has a lot of subtleties that really add to the game, and make it very strategic. There is a kind of an ebb and flow feeling you have to work with concerning the nobles, and you sometimes have to take losses to get bigger gains. I have a lot of respect for this game and see why it is so highly rated. I hope to discover more of the strategy with more plays. My rating may rise as a result.

Et bien, j'ai baissé la note du jeu de 7 à 4...Une nouvelle partie montrant que le jeu se stabilise en milieu de plateau et se transforme en une lutte de lancers de dé...l'intuition de départ était la bonne, quand le système est maitrisé, deux joueurs équivalents termineront toujours sur une situation identique.

Great wargame in which each side has very different challenges that blend together into an always engaging game. The English levy and cards create a different game situation every year, and are different every game. Nice ebb and flow as each side gets more or less moves each year. Fog of war gives some nice bluff opportunities. This game really makes you feel like you are William Wallace, using guerrilla tactics, or King Edward, squashing the Rebels with brute force when the supply timing is right. Gameplay around 3hrs is perfect, not an all day affair.

Very intense and easy to teach.

This is a fantasticly enjoyable and thought-provoking game which is relatively simple for a war game, yet contains enough strategy options to keep even the most hard-core players interested.  The game is wel-balanced, in my experience the Scots and English have equally good chances of winning.  The outcome of the game thankfully doesn't rest on the opening few moves, and outlandish comebacks are possible.  There is the usual element of luck, but one should see such cases of jamminess even out over the course of a game or two though

A very difficult game, IMO, to grasp.  What seems is a simple, short rulebook is, in fact, a very difficult set of rules exceptions.  The nobles wintering provides a lot of depth, but also a lot of familiarity with in order to do well, it seems.  It is great to see it balanced, despite being an asymmetric 2-player wargame.  I don't see myself ever choosing this over War of the Ring or Twilight Struggle.  Rolling poorly in this game (which I seem to do lately) can really be frustrating at times.  Otherwise an okay game.

Some are a bit turned off by how badly a well planned strategy can be ruined by the randomness of the dice but it works ok for me.  The theme is a favorite of mine so that lends to the rating a bit I'm sure.  The paper map is a bit of a dissapointment but that has nothing to do with the play.  Love the back and forth tempo of the game.  Playing the Scots is the most fun for me.

I have no idea how the Scots are suppose to win.  Played the Braveheart scenario and lost by year 3.  If the English player had been aggressive, I would have lost a year earlier, but known the game was over after the first year.  No idea how or why this is ranked so high.  All it takes is for the English player to have a semi-strong hand on the first and second turns, coupled with 2-3 bad rolls for the Scottish, and the Scots are doomed.  Probably removing 'Crusader Rex' and 'Richard III' from my wish-list because of this horrible experience.  That's what I get for trying a non-GMT wargame I suppose.

The fact that this game can be won after 5 hours of gameplay by 1 single roll of 1 dice and the advantage being with the opponent having to roll a 1-4 is an absolute disgrace! The gameplay was just going back and forth all game no-one realy dominating just seemed like you were back to square 1 after every round. I controlled 1 extra noble than my opponent so all he had to do last round was gain a noble and he would have won which was fair enough i thought!!! until i protected the nobles i thought he would attack only to find that on the very last turn of the last year to end the game he played a card (i think it was the herald card) where all he had to do was choose a noble roll a dice and take control of that noble ... luckily he failed and i won the game but the fact i could of lost after all the gameplay time to 1 roll of a dice infuriated me. I will never play this game again and probably.. hang,draw & quarter anyone i see in possession of this (u want to be william wallace i`ll show you william wallace)

RATING: 7
Simple and fun block game with decent replayability. Much more chaotic than you may realize in the first couple of plays. Good theme, but definitely just a game, not a simulation.

The game will have a hard stop somewhere around a dozen plays, because by then you've pretty much seen it all, though for a dozen plays I think you've gotten your money's worth with just about any wargame.

Heavy play, including a round robin tournament of this game where we tracked ops, has resulted in what has become dubbed [i]The Mentieth Line[/i] strategy, and made us realize that the first two turns are absolutely critical for the English.

Simple, elegant, assymetric, historically sound, brilliant fog of war, quick play time, tough decisions, and flippin' William Wallace make for an excellent introduction to the hobby of wargaming.

If 'is nawt Sco'ish, it's crap!

RATING: 9
A good introductory wargame with lots of tension, thrills and spills. (The latter via the dice-heavy combat system.) I'm a fan of the topic too. :-) The end of turn mechanics reduce the effectiveness of the blind mechanics since you'll know the identity of most blocks at the start of each turn. And the limited number of areas ultimately reduce the strategic choices. Despite these drawbacks, I still rate it highly since I think its the ideal introductory wargame.

After repeated plays, common bottleneck with English to north, Scots to south. eg. not enough variance. Also long. The shortest is the Braveheart scenario, and it's four hours or three if you're experienced. But, Braveheart.. plus wood counters

RATING: 8
I played this for the first time this past Saturday and really enjoyed it.  I found it fairly easy to learn and play—to the point where I could consider playing it with non-wargamers.

The mechanics fit the period perfectly, with Wallace running amok, and the English trying to catch him; the nobles constantly defecting between the two sides, and returning back to their lands in winter.  Suffice it to say, this is one I'm already excited to play again as soon as I can.

Don't let my rating misguide you: this is actually a very good game, just not to my taste. I don't like card driven games, especially those with complex rules and long playtime. However, as far as serious wargames that I've encountered go, this is probably one of the best - but it just isn't my cup of tea, I'm afraid. If I want a taste of a wargame, I'll play Memoir '44, which is simple and short enough to be able to play it in half an hour with anybody, and that is including the explanation of the rules.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pros:
+ "Braveheart" theme is very strong. You can dive into this medieval conflict (or our idea of it...)
+ The game is highly asymetrical but well balanced (perhaps a little towards the English). Cool rules
+ Very tense battles that keeps you nail biting
+ Outstandingly beautiful game

Cons: 
- It is too long: it took us almost five hours to complete 
- Compared to Julius Caesar it lacks some operational variety (for such a long game)

All in all a very good game, although it will not hit the table to often due to it's length.

8/10 points

RATING: 7
I had previously sworn off all block games after playing the horrible Wizard Kings.  I'm glad I was convinced to try another because I found I actually liked Hammer of the Scots.  It implements an excellent mechanism that prevents turtling.   At the end of each turn, all nobles are returned to their home regions.  It comes with 2 scenarios and at least one of them works well and should provide decent replayability. I'm still not crazy about the "fog of war" though, and how you can't verify what is being "stepped up"/upgraded/disbanded/etc.  But I think you just have to accept that mistakes will be made.  Further, the hidden blocks are going to make it awhile before some simple errors are discovered (if at all).  It would be real easy to forget which regions have already been "stepped" or maybe to forget to remove English non-infantry at the end of the turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting take on the block wargame system.  The English and Scottish players are in a conflict for control of the Scottish nobles, which switch allegiance (colour!) with alarming regularity.  Cards are played to bid for turn order and activate groups.  Both sides feel different - Scottish troops spring up everywhere and harry the English, while the English player has to muster forces in England and move them up.  Excellent 2-3 hour game (4-6 hours for full campaign).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
[Taylor] An elegant asymetrical game of guerilla war, which sees both sides engaging in back-and-forth campaigns across Scotland. Great fresh ideas with control of nobles and wonderful initiative system: the player who moves more units attacks first and gets to determine the main battles, but the other player can counterattack after the first player has committed himself. Also has great use of fog-of-war, wintering, mustering, and historical flavor. The ultimate expression of the block system to date in a highly-replayable package. I give this one my highest recommendation.

Great game, that IMHO captures this historical period.  The movement mechanics and wintering rules make you consider your options carefully.  My favorite Columbia Game.

Version 2.3 does a great job of clearing up some rules questions while adding a few subtle twists that have a substantial impact on the game.  Forcing reserves to fight for a round if your main attack/defense is wipped out, not allowing an overwintering Edward or his knights get replacement steps and allowing nobles to always get their defensive bonsus (when defending) are welcome changes that have a positive impact on the game.

The definitive block game in my opinion, Hammer of the Scots offers two distinctive scenarios (though almost everyone I know prefers the William Wallace to Robert the Bruce one) and the fascinating perspective where nobles frequently change sides. It was also fascinating to use the simple and limited (but well-balanced) card-driven mechanic in conjunction with a block game. It really works.

The standard setter for Columbia block games. I've played three other titles; Richard III, Wizard Kings and Rommel in the Desert by the time i got to this, so perhaps it hasn't blown my mind as much as it could have.

It is a really good game, and possibly the place to start with Columbia titles. It is almost an area control game, due to the victory conditions and changing allegiances of nobles, which makes it distinct from the other games in the series.

If you're wondering how the English can ever manage to make headway into Scotland due to the "go home" Wintering rules, just keep playing.  They take a huge hit in the opening of the game, but limitations in Scot recruitment mean that Edward and friends can break out if they are patient.

Fun Game.  Block counters are well designed and the game uses a Stratego-like attack system that adds a "fog of war" atmosphere to the game.  Down-sides include the board which is graphically uninteresting and made of flimsy cardboard.  Also, the english spend allot of the game chasing the Scots into Northern Scotland only to have to retreat to England when winter comes.  After 10 turns of chasing, monotney sets in.

This is what a wargame should be about - putting a player into the shoes of the respective commanders. Strong sense of theme.

Components, i.e., the map, is a bit sucky, after seeing the magnificient homemade effort on BGG.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A game about the battles of Scottish independence over the English rule. The goal is to control all the Scottish nobles by force or, more rarily, cunning.
The concept is interesting; the units are represented as wooden blocks facing towards the player, so that the opponent never sees them. This adds a surprise element to the game, at least to some point. Unfortunately the number of counters is so few (especially for the Scots) that this element is usually lost as the opponent can easily guess what the other player possesses.
The map is also designed so that there are only a few options for players to move their troops, and so the games usually start to follow the same pattern.
A game turn is played by random cards. The cards have the largest effect to the game, as they can turn the course of the game totally upside down.

Something about the (relative) simplicity and mystery of the Columbia block games appeals to me.

I appreciate the strength of the theme and the asymmetric play styles of the English and Scottish forces. The goal of capturing nobles adds an additional angle and promotes cautious play.

The only real downside is, as with many games of this type, the length to complete a full campaign. Fortunately there are several shorter scenarios that improve accessibility.

Third edition.  Regarded as one of the best introductory block games.  The newer [gameid=25277] seems to be a faster playing and easier alternative place to start with block games (HotS weight 3.0, WotRoses weight 2.7).  [gameid=1645] (weight 2.3) or [gameid=85] (weight 2.2) are perhaps the easiest of the Columbia block games, and most suitable for newbies.

RATING: 6
Braveheart (well, a historically-accurate Braveheart) 2P wargame using the Columbia block system. Plays well, nice and quick for a wargame, but my impression is that if/when the Scots can get a jump on the English early and get to eight or nine nobles, they have the advantage. Playing defensively by using the red-bordered area up north, they can run from the English knights until the end of the Braveheart scenario. The card-driven initiative/movement system and the dice-driven combat system put a degree of chaos into the game, but no more than you'd expect. *** UPDATE: Not as interesting in the longer term as Hannibal RvC, and since 2P wargames don't come up too often, table time suffers.

Reasonably quick play. This one pushes the upper limit of my attention span (~3 hrs) but the time passes quickly as the game is very engaging. The rules are good and don't get in the way.

I'm so disappointed by how flat this one felt. I've liked some hidden block games, but this one just came off being very dry and too lucked-based.  I love the history and it is clear the designers did their homework to make something feel like an accurate representation of the Wars.  The combat system was enjoyable, but got somewhat stale after a time.  There just wasn't any fun in our two games and in the moments there should have been tension just felt boring.  The need to understand the implications of the Wintering Phase were profound and unless you could quickly analyze board positions and see the end result of movement, then there was a good chance you were going to suffer from bad plays.  There is a good game here for people who want to put the time into it- that's clear.  I can't say it's a bad game because I believe the hundreds of people who love it are not personally wrong.  But this isn't a game for me.  There are some games that come off screwy the first couple of times, but you want to delve in more to see if you can grok it.  Hammer of the Scots - at least for me - ain't one of them.

I have only played this title once so my rating is based on initial impression.  This being my first block war game, the rules book (although a modest 7 or 8 pages) made for some focused homework.   Without experience in such genres, all the nuances and subtleties in the game play and strategy present  a grandiose escalator of possibility to the heavens.  My first, and so far, only playing of Hammer was clunky yet fueled with promise of times to come.  

UPDATE:  With further understanding of the mechanics, more time was spent on developing strategies.  this formula began to make the game shine.  I am lookng forward to investing more into this.

An very fun unusual wargame. It lives up to its hype. Fickle Nobles is the name of the game. The action is continuous once both players get the hang of the rules.  I'd play this game anytime.

10/6/07 - Still very fun, but I'm starting to think the balance leans too much towards the Scots for both scenarios.

The general production quality comes as a bit of a culture shock to someone used to more lavish eurogames. But this is a great introduction to wargaming - although all the little extra rules take some remembering.
Sadly, takes just too long to play to be of interest to those I play games with.

I initially thought this game to be an "8," but after several more plays, it grew on me even more. Now it has risen to the level of being in my top 5 with Hannibal, Washington's War, Napoleon at Waterloo, and Age of Napoleon. It is a GREAT game that is fast-moving, plays differently each time (and with twists each time due to the card-driven mechanic and variable block-draws). Highly recommended.

War games aren't necessarily my thing. This game has some solid mechanics. The combat system is easy enough, and movement isn't too complex in its intricacies. However, for some reason the back and forth loyalties of the nobles infuriated me more than it interested me. And between the cards and the dice, luck can rule the day despite good strategy.

A wonderful 2-player strategy-game from Columbia Games' block-series that can be played in 2-3 hours. Set in Scotland during the Braveheart-incident the players compete for the control of the 14 nobles of Scotland. Clever mechanics combine cards and blocks into a challenging puzzle that seems to provide lots of different strategies and new surprises every time it's played. The luck-factor is there, but it doesn't run the game. Highly recommended for anyone interested in quality strategy-games.

I enjoyed this a lot more than Wizard Kings.  There's more theme and more interesting decisions to be made, especially since you limited by your cards.  They did a nice job of making each side different from each other.  My only fear is the replay value.  Also, it should be noted that there are dice, they are used, and in my case, the Scots must've been hittin' the whisky, considering how bad my rolls were.  The only other thing for me with this game is that I appreciate that there is some theme, but I am not too into the theme itself.  I blame Braveheart.

Feb 2008 - First "play".  To be honest the rules are simple but the execution of said rules was tricksy.  It was like playing chess for the first time.  I still really enjoyed it and I look forward to another game, now that we have some idea of what's going on. April 2008 - Very simple game to 'learn' but the execution is terribly difficult!  Both games so far have been Scottish blow-outs as England has been having a hard time getting her forces to stay in Scotland.  I'll need a few more plays I think... Third play and it's beginning to make more sense with a more sensible opponant.  Scots crowned a Frenchie king and lost because of it. Silly French!

More than most wargames, Hammer of the Scots is a dynamic game where bold strategies can lead to sudden victory - or to dramatic defeat.  The game's central conceit is the way that nobles can flip loyalties in the blink of an eye based on who is occupying their home territories.  That loyalty system drives the game forward, and gives it a different feeling than any other wargame I've played.

The two sides play very differently, which is another excellent feature.  The English are militarily strong, but have movement and supply problems.  The harsh Scottish winters are hard on them, and they must work quickly to penetrate the Scottish lands during the warmer months.  The Scots aren't strong enough to win very many pitched battles, but they excel at guerilla tactics.

I still haven't decided whether the two sides are balanced.  I've mostly played the English, and seen them win.  But I think the Scots require a different approach than we've given them so far.

I'm not crazy about the game's simplistic card activation system. I would have preferred to see something that was a little more sophisticated, or maybe a little more balanced.

A remarkable amount of flavor for such a simple wargame. I had fun fleeing around the Highlands even as my opponent's English infantry ground my rebellion into dust. It will likely take a game or two to figure out how to play the Scots, but it promises to be a fun process. Repeat playing which revealed wonderful subtleties not obvious in my first game. Possibly Columbia's best game (only EastFront really competes with Hammer), which is saying a lot because Columbia offers an excellent library of games. After ten or so games I think I'm ready to put this one on the shelf for awhile but it has been a fun ride.

2/12/2010 - Played for the first time on my new 3rd edition board. Man is this thing beautiful.  This game is fantastic i love the wintering aspect it definitely brings the game to life.  The defecting nobles is amazing as well and really makes sense when you think about it.  If you were a noble who returned home after being away for close to a year and your territory was occupied with the enemy, you might defect also.

Played 3+ The practice of rotating blocks to change unit values works nicely. Expensive at £40 and what gives with the board? The card stock is no thicker than that used for cereal boxes. I find it easy to muddle myself over the retreating / supporting rules and its a case of "Oops I got that wrong again didn't I" and sitting around fuming at my stupidity for an hour or more while I see out the game *UPDATE* 4th time I have played, 3rd time was over 6 months ago. Again I didn't enjoy the experience. This time the English killed Wallace in the first year and the Scottish (me) initiated no successful attacks, eventually losing every territory. I am a fan of German strategy games. Hammer of the Scots will not change me into a wargamer. Sept 03

An absolute gem of a game here, a truly unique masterpiece of game design with just the right amount of luck. Usually I dislike Dice rolling combat systems but HotS implements a great use of initiative to make each battle very interesting. The gut wrenching decisions of where to attack and reinforce along with very short windows to execute said manouvers creates one hell of an intense game. Any game where you are thinking of strategies and blown opportunities 3+ days later after a session equals one great game in my book.

I might like this even more than Julius Caesar.  Hammer makes much better use of the fog of war that the blocks provide, because individual blocks are much more important than in Caesar.  On the other hand, the mid-board choke point might limit replayability.  More plays are needed.

My favorite of the Columbia block wargames. The leaders switching sides mechanic is historical and makes gameplay more interesting: a win-win. Can run long, but every turn is immersive. I prefer to play the English, who can use wintering to execute a powerful thrust deep into Scotland on back-to-back turns. This has to be carefully planned though, and could end badly on a double event play.

Good: Strategic - Medieval - Easy

Plus:
-Innovative
-Theme
-Accessible
-Time
-Replay value
-Components: nice big blocks and clear beautiful map (Jerry/ Columbia, use this map as much as you can!)

Minus:
-Maybe a tad too long but when 2 events are played at the same time the years ends. This speed things up but it maight not happen...  
-I really can't think of grave minuses. Only thing would be the limited strategies. 

First of all I must state that the map is gorgeous and should be used more often if possible. With all respect to the 3rd edition, I am glad I have the 2nd edition.

Historic setting, the wintering, not knowing when the year ends, the nobles, the special rules for the kings and Wallace, all come together so well in Htos. Simply briljant. 

Very playable, well themed, nice gateway game or evening filler. Nice big blocks and just perfect if you want a lighter wargame.
However its's limitation would be the fairly limited strategies. Moreover, plays quickly but can be a bit long (3 hours+).

This game has an interesting dynamic, there is an ebb and flow as England campaigns in spring, then both sides disperse for winter. There is a volatile frontline as changing clan loyalties open conflict in unexpected quarters, often requiring flexible play from both sides (particularly the Scots). The board is tight so it plays a little 'gamey' but in a good way, so I consider it a light wargame but not a consim. The wooden blocks and 'Fog of war' add much to the experience.

That aside I feel I have finally got to know this game. Have played a lot of this recently; first two occassions were F2F and a few rules were slightly scrambled but, have completed a number of telephone based game of this and it worked really well. Used ACTS to generate the cards etc and then played out a campaign year every other night or so. 

There are some lovely aspects to this game and it does play really well. I think it is simpler than Crusader Rex and the theme and the mechanics work very well indeed.

Similar to Wizard Kings, but with vastly different mechanisms for movement and recruitment.  Played as one of two scenarios, you must try to control a majority of the nobility before the game ends or crush your opponent's King(s) for a "sudden death".

RATING: 6
My first experience of block wargames and overall a positive experience. However, this particular incarnation leaves the players very much at the mercy of the luck of the draw for cards and reinforcements. A bad hand means that there's little you can do, and if you don't have an event card you can't end the year early. A late draw of Edward for the English is similarly limiting as English reinforcements vary hugely in value. In all, a much bigger random factor than I generally like to see in a wargame, but a reasonably historical theme.

The first real wargame I think I've played! It's a light one.  I enjoy that a lot of the important decisions have to do with whether or not to run away. I also like the rhythm of the game--winter is a neat idea.  Anyway, it's fairly random but I enjoyed it a lot. (1 play)

Bought because I like the idea of block wargames and this was the most popular. Once I played it, I can see why. Very dynamic in nature, with a lot of shifting around the board thanks to everyone going home in the winter and the back-and-forth loyalties of the nobles. It also has a deep ruleset with appropriate nuances for the time period. However, it's a bit slow-paced and takes a good amount of time to play, so not something I can see myself pulling out very often. For the right situation, though, a great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Very interesting, lightly card-driven "war game for the Euro crowd."  The historical chrome is a bit of a pain to teach but mostly stays in the background during the actual game, and the asymmetric gameplay looks to keep things interesting for a while.  The focus on getting and keeping nobles on your side is a really unique idea which, combined with the relative ease of replenishing your forces during Wintering, prevents things from getting too "wipe out your enemy" wargamey, while still maintaining a strong area-control element (since you can steal nobles from your opponent by occupying their home territory during Wintering).  I'm not usually a huge dice-chucking wargame fan but Hammer of the Scots shows promise.

RATING: 8
This was the first block game I've played and I was pleased with the mechanics.  As for the game itself, I think the cards and block pool draw make for too chaotic play.  The winter resets are frustrating for the English and brutal on the Scots.  This makes for a make or break hand of cards to replenish and go on an offensive during a year.  I'm sure a lot of people can employ over-arching strategies that work out in the long run but I found the constant 'pray for good cards to do something effective on a round' annoying.  While there are plenty of themed mechanisms and chaos to add to replayability, I think a lot of the options are too demanding to excercise.

Update:  After allowing myself to further fall into the block gaming genre, I've become more enamoured with HotS' design.  Everything I initially despised, I'm now eager to retry.

I would rate Hammer of the Scotts higher, but the fog of war does not work well for me in this game.  Because of the fact that the nobles all return home every year, I find I usually know which blocks are where.  I prefer other related block games like Liberty (use optional French entry), Crusader Rex (use most recent rules), and Athens vs Sparta.

9 plays of the Braveheart scenario. The game components could be better; the wooden blocks are great, but the map is uninspiring (both the cardboard and the graphics) and the card graphics are particularly poor. The rules are a little fiddly, though version 2.0 of the rulebook is an improvement. However, the game itself makes up for the above. There is plenty of substance, with a fair amount of historical flavour and interesting tactical possibilities. The element of chance, due to both the card-driven movement and die-driven battles, seems too high at times (the English player, in particular, relies on good card hands and can also be severely restricted if Edward rarely puts in an appearance). But the chance factor does help to keep the game play dynamic and together with the assymmetry of the sides (particularly with the different rules for wintering) has helped maintain my interest in HoTS through many plays.

I played this a number of times when it came out. It was OK at first. The rules are clean and the game does play rather fast. They did a very nice job on the map and the box art, and I like how the units look on the blocks, but overall the game left me cold after so many plays. There seems to be limited strategies and it did not give me the flavor of the era. Although admittedly, I am not that familiar with this part of English/Scottish history. Having said that, they are a very good company and I can see this being a good intro game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Excellent block wargame with asymmetrical forces.  I can't wait to play it again.  The historical period covered is interesting, and the game plays very well.  On the component side of things, the blocks are wonderful, the board is acceptable, but the cards are of lower quality.  However, simply sleeving them fixes this issue. The nobles switching sides is wonderful and adds a lot to the game. All in all this is a game that I could see climbing to a 9 or 10 after more playings.

Update bumped up to a "9" after a couple more playings.

Truly fantastic game. Elegantly simple mechanic, in terms of movement and keeping track of changes. Square blocks for the playing pieces which rotate to determine strength left. 
Scots seem to have a hard time winning for many reviewers, but this really comes down to tactics - the Scots do have a fair chance! Although the game seems radically unbalanced, the Scots have access to just a few more 'good' pieces than do the English, and can turn the tide. If you are the sort of aggressive, dogmatic player who hates running away, you will ALWAYS lose this game, no matter which side you play - the need for subtle tactics on when to stand and when to run are what make this so good. The Schiltrom extra rule is better used than ignored IMHO.

RATING: 7
Initial rating one partial play only

Unbelievable theme, really love it here and its thick while the mechanics also work themactically not just themeatic touches or anything.  Might be hard to catch up once behind, dice can pose a problem, and its on the long side but a pretty short rule set for a war game. 

Lots of strategy, your able to plan a whole year (5 turns) but it appears like some things might seem scripted after a few games as certain plays become more obvious and each year can seem repetitive which might hurt replay. I see there are two scenarios but maybe there should be two more to help with this...  

A little like Stratego on steroids for sure with the Fog of War. Cards, King appearance and initial recruits are all random, Nobles switching sides will really keep you on your toes, decisions seem tough which is good. Luck in all may be a little higher than I would like, I'll need to play more War games to compare (it seems many have this same issue)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I love how the English and the Scottish have such asymmetrical starting positions.  When you first look at the board you think the Scottish are going to take a beating, but then by year two you might think the English have no chance.

The biggest downside I see here is that it needs two players of equal talent to shine.  A beginner has basically no chance of upsetting a vet.  The strategy is just too opaque the first couple times through.  Also, an unlucky hand of cards can hamstring you at times.

Ultimately though, this is the kind of game that makes you want to play again even if you just took a beating.  The differing styles of play required by each side ensure a high replay value.

A good game, with the blocks working well.  Requires careful play from the Scots to start - fanning the flames of rebellion.  Won with the English in two turns, having the King from the beginning really helped.

Ah, too bad. I really wanted to love this one. Great theme, sharp blocks, nicely layed-out (if cheap) map. Double luck-dependence (cards AND dice) along with limited strategies (campaigning through a bottleneck) bring down the game for me. Does Wallace fight well early? Does the King arrive early and often to wreak havoc and establish continuity? Do you issue an early Herald?  It's all out of your control.

Only played once, but had the system down by the third or fourth turn.

Very smart system.  I enjoyed the assymetrical challenges each side faced.  Reminded me of A Victory Lost in that way.  

Too long for my tastes.  The game was three and a half hours, even after the rules explanation.  I could see that coming down with repeated plays, but not to the 120 minutes as advertised.  

This might be an "8", but I can't tell yet.  The one game I played was effectively over after the third turn, after an apocalyptic battle at Falkirk (8 English units against 9 Scottish units) where the English got absolutely rolled.  I'll re-visit this ranking after my next play.

This game is beautiful and so's the gameplay. The only two gripes are:
<br />1. At first, the situation *appears* hopeless for the Scots (all those red blocks look so daunting).
<br />2. The rule book is a little too scattered. It'll list a rule and then, two pages later, it'll tell you the exception (and then, in another section, it'll tell you the second exception). Thank Eris that the rules are relatively simple and short. I suspect I'll have them memorized after a second play.

My favorite block wargame.  At its heart, its a simple game and its very streamlined.  However, there is alot of replay value and subtle strategy.  The brillant move of making the VPs combat units works well.  The assymetric balance between the powerful but distant English and the local and mobile Scots is near perfect.  At first, the English had a big advantage but that has been reduced with repeated play to close to 50/50.

Hammer of the Scotts--and most of the Columbia Games block games--is fantastic. a classic.

Excellent, intensely thematic game in which each side plays totally different strategically.  Game is not about resolving combat per se but area control, surprise moves and hidden information.  Feels and plays very historically accurate.  Would be a 10 except for the component quality which is unfortunately pretty bad.  The wooden army blocks are fine, but the cards and the game board are kind of a joke.

Only played solo so far, but looks to maintain Columbia's high standard. Good historical colour - especially for a Scot living in England! Update 11 Feb 2003: I've played 6 or 7 face-to-face games now, and the game keeps getting better. Each playing throws up different situations for both sides, which keeps it fresh and gives good replay value. Can take a long time to play if both players play cautiously - short games are only likely when one side takes a risk and either sweeps all before him.....or ends up leaving himself wide open and consequently being hammered!

Wow!  This is way better than Risk & Stratego.  With that said, I guess HotS is our first 'real' wargame.  The straight forward combat valuation of each block is very slick.  The year-end Winter phase and the switching of sides by noble elimination or castle occupation adds just enough tension to a game that is both original and engaging.  Currently our games tend to be more tactical than strategic as we become increasingly familiar with the map regions, characters, and game mechanics.

Brilliant game. It's not terribly complex, yet it presents strategic challenges--particularly with regard to the nobles' tendency to flip-flop between sides and how you can box them out of their home territories as you approach the winter of each year.

The battle system in particular impresses me. Terrain effects are nicely accounted for by the use of borders and their varying limits. I'm very interested in the theme, having studied abroad in Scotland during college. 

It's a good introduction to wargames, but also quite playable even with people who aren't really predisposed to like them.

Played 20  games by this point.  More complicated than most wargamers would like to admit, but an entertaining enough game with plenty for both players to do.  Avoids the war of attrition and "one large stack"  effects common to the company's other designs. Columbia's best effort to date.  

Beginning players should take the English as they are more robust - the Scots have to play a careful and precise game (at least early on).  I feel the design is well-balanced, but you have to be willing to take your lumps as you learn how to properly play each side.

Rating is highly volatile at this point - only one play so far, which I consider to be a learning game.  I'm new to wargames, and this seemed like a good entry point.

I like the game system and feel that this has the potential to be very fun when played between two experienced players.

The basics of the game are quite straightforward, but I would've liked more symbols on the blocks for those pesky rule exceptions. The game is quite interesting and tense, but requires much rulebook-referencing because of the "thematic" rules.

A nice job of grafting history onto a light game.  Doesn't have the lengthy roll-to-hit sessions I find bothersome in other block games.  However, it can come across as something of a scrambling Stratego (that sounds harsher than intended).  Wintering/levy rules make the game. The difficulty in maintaining anything much resembling a "front" makes play challenging and variable = replayable.

I've played both sides now, and the underlying strategies of each are starting to come into focus.  There's a lot of game here that you just don't realize the first time you open the box and set it up.  Sure there is the random element of dice rolling that can turn the tide at an inopportune time, but a smart player can reduce the impact of poor dice rolling by proper distribution of troops.  The wintering step gets a bit "busy", but everything else plays smoothly.  Really starting to enjoy this game, I look forward to the next play.

Average two-player block wargame with some interesting ideas, but longish and the gameplay becomes rather tedious due to the repetitive sequences of dicerolls. The event cards are wacky (truce is too powerful). The important battles are concentrated in a few central coastal Scottish areas and the overal replayability is low. There are better wargames with similar mechanisms that play a lot faster and offer more variability (like Commands & Colors Ancients).

Great strategy game.  Excellent theme.  The game mechanism forcing nobles to return home each winter, possibly causing them to switch sides is an outstanding rule that heavily impacts game play.  Highly recommended.

There are some games where the abstraction gets in the way, for me this is one of those games.  I prefer games where the quality of forces is easier to determine and movement is a little less byzantine.  Playing this game is like working a puzzle.  No thanks.

RATING: 8
A really well done game.  Minor differences in the wintering rules for the two sides make a huge difference in their strategies, and the idea of a wargame with combat units which are victory points & which switch sides is really clever.  I don't play this nearly as much as I'd like to.

Update: Dude!  The burrito boy, age 6, likes this!

RATING: 7.5
Very random but still very much fun, as the randomness is evenly enough  distributed, though a couple bad hands of cards in a row or crappy die rolls in a decisive battle can ruin your game, but in those cases it comes down to a sudden death victory quickly.
Perfect introductory block wargame, Euro players too will feel right at home. Play time came quickly down to circa 2-3 hours (even when going all the way to the endgame scoring).

The Braveheart scenario is tough on the Scots unless they get a couple lucky rounds in right from the start, "the schiltroms" optional rule works here. The Bruce scenario is better balanced.

Homemade version with one of the real cool redesign maps found right here

One of the better from Columbia games.  It can however feel somewhat repetitive at times.  The game does not really "grow" over the course of the scenario.  By that I mean that the 1st or 2nd year plays very similarly to the 5th or 6th year.  Most games - particularly wargames - have a certain flow to them.  This one is more back and forth, back and forth.  Sometimes it can feel like a basketball game in which only the last 2 minutes were really worth watching.

Hammer of the Scots was quite a fun when I played it first time. But after 3-5 games I was ready to move on: every game feels the same, there are too much luck involved (cards, dice rolling), and definitely there should be more troops: now there are so few of them, that your hidden units (which is a good idea) are not so hidden as they should be. Those wooden blocks are great, but cards and gameboard are extremely miserable. If I want to play a wargame I prefer Age of Napoleon.

The first block wargame I ever played.  HotS is such a deep game with minimalistic game components.  Momentum swings can be drastic from one game round to another and I'm usually not "secure" in any position until the final round(s) - when it's too late, just roll 'em or run.

I enjoyed my one play thus far although there was a bit of a learning curve (still, this game is fairly easy for a block war game).  Also, we did play one rule incorrectly early one as the British were incorrectly limited to stopping after crossing the dotted black boundary - oops.  The combat system was intriguing with its priority based rolling on A,B,C system and number of dice/value.

Although I've only played a few times, I feel this is a game that I will enjoy for a long time.  The relatively elegant rules (for a war game), the different stratgies needed to play each side, and the relatively quick play time (again for a war game) have convinced me that this is a quality game.

RATING: 5
Looks like Columbia found the right balance between playability and realism and the right mix between simple system and a fun game at last.  The block counters of different noble shields add a lot of the colors to the game as oppossed to the dull NATO symbols of WW2.  Cards have given player the freedom to play special event or tactic giving advantages to the player.  Historicity appears not to be compromised a lot.  However, after several play, you can fairly figure out the general strategies taken by the British or by the Rebels.  And the campaign thus tended to concentrate a lot in certain heavily contested area, e.g. the central Scotland.  The tactics are not varied enough given by the limited number of special tactical cards.  It turns out eventually the truce cards are more important than others when played at a right time.  Otherwise, the action cards provide the general tempo of the game flow.  One interesting game mechanic is the change of sides of the nobles from initial British to the rebel cause.  However, that alone could not add much flavour to the overall game mechanics The British's only strategy is to be "keep- sending'em- hell- lot-of troops" from the border in the south.  The Rebels, on the other hand, circle the nobles in mid-Scotland and turn them into pro-rebel cause.  Talking about politics here.  After all, this is a simple strategy game aiming at attracting new blood to the hobby.  If you are not expecting high, you will not loose anything.

Played the heck out of it during the summer of 2009. I like the limited intelligence in the block system. The rules are simple, and there are a good deal of viable tactics leading. At present I think control of 3 or 4 key areas is the way to win for both sides, but that could be the product of playing the same opponents repeatedly.

My biggest gripe is that the surface on the stickers get abraided quickly, unless you keep the blocks on felt when they are facedown.

Any ideas on how to fix this?? - Aah, you can actually buy new sheets of stickers from the publisher

Block wargames are an interesting beast, and this makes good use of the mechanic.  The combat is very dicey, and the terrain rules are complicated and not always intuitive, but beyond that Hammer of the Scots proves to be a very solid game.  It's difficult to say what the endgame actually achieves, however; something feels off about it.

I was really jacked to play this, as I wanted a good wargame and love all things Scottish.  Boy, was I disappointed.

I don't even know how to rate this game.  I didn't like having to move the nobles back to their home territory each winter.  It feels counterintuitive and I just couldn't get over it.  In the end, it just pissed me off.  TRADED 1/08

A block war game where you play cards to move armies and attack other players.  It has a "fog of war" but at the end of five turns in a year all nobles return to a home center.  There are also winter limits on the number of units that can occupy a space.  

It has moderately complex rules, but in my one play, I found it to be very fun.  

There is depth to the game and the game rewards multiple plays.

Simple rules and mechanics that offer a wide range of possibilities. Asymmetrical (there are many opional rules to help the side you think is disadvantaged).
Being for 2 players, it hasn't two of the worst flaws of all wargames: player elimination and coalition against someone (the leader, the weakest, the unlucky...).
Luck isn't negligible (cards and dice) and can occasionally be crucial.
Nice historical flavor.

The English are trying to quell the Scottish rebellion from 1297 to 1314 in this two-player, block-style wargame. William Wallace leads the underdogged rebellion, while King Edward Longshanks leads the potent English forces trying to stop the revolt. Fickle Scottish nobles change sides frequently swaying the balance of power. HOTS is the best block-style wargame I've played.

Quite old now already but nice, very elegant game. Very simple rules but deep strategic planning possible during each game.
However, I believe there are not many winning strategies possible. With experienced players subsequent games tend to be quite similar, so I am not sure if re-playability is very high.
I prefer similar game - Hellenes as there are more possible roads to victory.

Only played once, and I feel I ought to play again before rating it (this hasn't stopped me with other games, but this one deserves a second look I feel -- sadly I have so many games that it's on the back burner right now).

UPDATE: This is a very good game. I see why it has its good rep now. Very streamlined, and plays fast once you've internalized the modest ruleset. This is my first Columbia block game, and based on how good it is I'll probably be picking up Julius Caesar ASAP.

This is an excellent game. Fog-of-war by using blocks works very well as you can hold ground with poor units by making surprising moves etc and invite the enemy to attack where your finest troops are!

I don't like card-driven games but this war game is not ruined by dictating or too powerful cards. You must create unigue strategy for each war year after seeing your cards for the year.

Rule book could be better as there are some minor issues which are not so clear. However, teaching rules for new gamers is easy and doesn't take too much time.

Great game! Alot more detail then first meets the eye. I think in order for balance though, you MUST use the Schiltroms optional rule! Can't wait to play again! the reason for not giving it a higher rating is because of the cheat factor. Super easy to cheat! Play with honest people.
After several more plays as the Scot's, I dropped my score. Seems unbalanced, maybe doing something wrong...(getting my ars kicked!)

I've played this game about a half dozen times (two of these shouldn't count, because I got my Scottish ass whooped in the first couple of turns). I beginning to wonder if this game has some serious balance issues. I've only played the English once (and won). The rest of the times, I've played the Scots with varying degrees of failure. The unrelenting waves of fresh English troops seems overwhelming. The fact that the English have a huge edge on the initiative. The dependence on luck (dice and cards). All of these things are starting to blunt my enthusiasm for this game. I'm not giving up yet...but as medieval wargames go, I'd probably rather play Battlelore.

Good game. I enjoy the block system and this one is better than some of the more simple games like 1812, yet still easy to learn.

Great game, first one to introduce me to hidden deployment and block figures with variable strength. Love the wintering "flying-noble" mechanics, allows for interesting strategies often to block nobles from returning home so they switch sides. The once-every-other winter in scotland rule with Edward I really makes the game interesting and, I believe, quite a lot more difficult for the English than for the Scots, at least decision wise. For the Scots I seem to recall the general strategy being to secure most of the weak, northern nobles then grab Wallace and decimate everything in the 4 strength A3s path!

RATING: 9
This is a brilliant game, and I can see why it's a classic. I've played some wargames, but "introductory" is a good level for me, and HotS does a bang-up job in that space. It's my first block game.

My first game went three hours and was called due to time at the end of the second year of the Bruce scenario. But after another learning game or two, particularly with the same opponent, I think we'd move much more briskly. (We encountered almost every mechanical element of the game.)

But for all that, it didn't feel long. I got trounced, which I expected, but had a blast along the way. Lots of mistakes all around, and a missed rule or two, but that's the nature of a learning game.

I love the asymmetry. Both sides play completely differently, and learning their respective rhythms looks like it'll be a lot of fun. Planning five turns with one hand leads to plenty of interesting, tense decisions, and the dice add a swingy element that works beautifully in context.

I love the components, too. The stickers are clear, and the blocks are lovely to handle. The map is gorgeous.

The rulebook felt like it was fighting us throughout the first game, though. Many times we had questions which could only be resolved by flipping to multiple sections, hunting for a single (sometimes oddly-worded) sentence. But after one game, I think we'd need it much less going forward.

I do wish that the non-noble blocks didn't have names on them, as it would make them even easier to discern in play. But all of those are quibbles -- this is a splendid game.

4 / 5 - Great.

The triumph of this game is its balanced blend of history, playability and strategic depth - much like Axis & Allies. However it succeeds at finding that balance much better than A&A - it's simpler, more historical and more interesting to play without sacrificing any drama or excitement. It's major downside is that it can be quite hideously random at times, thanks largely to the small number of dice thrown.

RATING: 9
12/04/03 Bought. I have what is now considered the first edition. This was my first fog-of-war block game (unless I count Stratego). I feel its earned every award and honor its received. The down side is its so good that judging all other block games by its high standard leaves the vast majority of them wanting. So the only other one I've bought since is Richard III, which is by the same designer and is, I feel, basically 85% HotS component and rules-wise set in 1460. That last 15% are changes to align it with the later period. One thing that turns me off most block games are the maps. I think HotS did it right with areas. I feel hex maps and road network maps don't work with blocks. They *very* often don't have enough room for more than 4 blocks in one city/hex. The most ludicrous example I've encountered is in Napoleon when the French may cram 20 blocks into one town.     

As of 12/03/16 I've played 19 times; the Braveheart scenario 14 times, and The Bruce scenario 5 times. Its difficult to get anyone to play The Bruce scenario for as soon as I tell them Wallace is dead by then, his block won't be used, they often lose interest. To me both scenarios are great.

Cautious, probably a bit worse than a 6 for me but too early to tell. My one play was fine, but lacked a bit of substance - though I'll be willing to put it down to lack of food and exhaustion.

Play cards, move about, roll dice and repeat. The game is fast and engaging but I'll need to see more of a strategy to it all instead of "roll better" than I did on my first play. I'm not saying it isn't there, just that I couldn't find it. Also, I think I want something else from my "duel" games than this gives. More the fraught tension of TS or the deeper move-countermove of abstracts.

Hey, my 2nd or third wargame though (depending on whether Twilight Struggle counts heh)!

I played this for the first time at BGG.CON 2008 and ended up winning as the Scots, though it was more or less by luck/accident. I didn't feel like I played that well. I did have a few unlucky dice rolls early, but I got too aggressive and made a couple foolish errors that were even more damaging.

The block system works very well in this game, as you try to "flip" various nobles to your side in the struggle between England and Scotland. The game can swing wildly in just one turn, if you make a good move or get lucky.

The wintering rules are very tough on the English player and can lead to some interesting swings. There are some "gamey" moves you can make to take advantage of these rules, but this is a fairly minor quibble.

I feel I was wise to withhold an 8 until I was able to play it a few more times and see how it held up.

I've found the English to be much more challenging. That is to say, I sucked hard at playing that side for a long time. For whatever reason, I found it harder to intuitively grasp the proper English strategy and I flailed around a bit while getting slowly and methodically beaten down.

After about 6-8 plays, I feel like I'm almost ready to stop playing this game. It feels a bit played out right now. Maybe in a year or two I'll come back to it, but almost all of the games seemed quite samey, and so I need a break.

This is a very good game, and my only block game to date.  Pretty tense, good battles with dice rolling and fog-of-war.  Played pretty quickly, and a lot more strategy than I initially expected.  Lots of ebb and flow: just when you think you've got the Scots, they manage to bounce back.  I can reccommend this game highly.

Just bought this game, and after my first session I was blown away. The two sides seems very well ballanced (rules 3.0) which is quite amazing considering the asymetrical aspects of the two sides.

I am not very fond of dice in games, but in this one I have a feeling that clever play is much more important than luck-of-the-dice.

This game was in my head quite a few days after the session, which is normally a pretty good sign.
Can´t wait to play some more.

An elegant design, an interesting scenario and some tough decisions.  I had a difficult time wrapping my head around the wintering strategies.

I look foward to playing this again soon and trying out the designers other game Crusader Rex.

A high potential game hampered by typos and cheap map board.  This game has nice streamlined game rules that tame ordinary wargame concepts.  The card system and dice add randomness without making it too luck driven.  Limited replayability and the occasional strategy ruining streak of bad die rolls make one wanting more depth.  This game is still on the Risk side of the fence when it comes to wargames.

One side is playing the offensiv english army trying to recontrol the power in the revolting areas. The other side represents the scottish rebellionists entrenching themselfes in the mountains watching for a good moment to take control over more areas and to get the unstable nobles. My first block game and still one of my top favourits.

Intital play (solo): The components, as expected, are great (although they didn't seem to include a turn marker). My initial solo play seemed to heavily favor the English, but otherwise the game was enjoyable and very easy to learn.

Update: I've now played three games of HotS (all solo). After realizing I wasn't playing the English correctly during the overwintering stage, I find the game much more balanced--at least in theory. The luckless English did manage to have almost all 1 and 2 cards and no events, whilst the Scots got mostly 2s and 3s and many more events. That's the way it goes.

My first and favorite block game.  By far, one of the best asymetrical conflict games I have ever played - and the theme is capture beautifully.  If you are English, You WILL hate Wallace. . and if you are Wallace, you will RUN from the King. Meanwhile, you beat Nobles into submission. . .card driven captures the randomness of resources in this period, and the game is just plain FUN.  Lost a .5 due to some rule ambiguities that sucked the fun out of WBC last year, but new revision should solve that . ..

While this is commonly cited as being a great example of a sort of beginner's war game, it nevertheless has a degree of complexity which might seem slightly daunting for the typical Euro game fan (myself included).  Still, in the couple opportunities I have had to play this (plus a couple soloing excursions) I found it to be a very well done, aesthetically pleasing, thematically/mechanically rich game.

A nice light wargame to introduce people to wargaming.
And Block Wargame are my favourite. Plus, the rules are adapted to the historical context making it fascinating for history geek like me. Battle are quit a mess to figure and British are a bit OP to me. 
Nevertheless, it is a classic that deserve to be on every wargamer shelf.

Holy cow is this is a brutal game. Played the Braveheart scenario as the Scots for the first time.

It seems, after a couple of playings, that a good portion of the game is decided based upon what the English player draws in the first couple of levies.  If the King and a couple of good units come out, then the English can do well.  Otherwise, the Scots can dominate.  Or perhaps I just don't appreciate the strategies involved.

Despite the luck of the dice and the cards, I seem to enjoy the first few years of this game and then get bored with the back-and-forth. The game length here clearly caters to the war/historical game crowd, and to them it might even seem short. But for someone who's mostly a Eurogamer at heart, I think I'd rather play a couple games of [boardgame=3201][/boardgame] and [boardgame=36522][/boardgame], which give you the same kind of assymetrical cat-and-mouse game this does without all the luck or time.

RATING: 7.2

I was playing the English in my first game and, again, suffered from some lousy luck; rolling zero hits from eleven chances is a bit of a disappointment. Plenty of low value cards (I saw a three card on two occasions for the entire game) which made it a tribulation to get English forces across the border. Also, Edward I only deigned to come north twice, leaving the affair in the hands of his less-capable subordinates. Add to that, an experienced opponent who had a pretty good plan and the game was over about halfway through the timer track.

That said, the game itself worked fine and was pretty easy to pick up. There were a number of features I liked but it seemed just too much effort to get guys across the border and linked up with local loyal nobles let along even consider leaving the lowlands (especially with the supply limits as a factor). I just didn't feel like I was getting anywhere near being able to develop any sort of strategy. I guess I have a fair bit to learn with this one but, despite a less-than-stellar first outing (due to my own poor decision making as much as some lousy luck) I would definitely give this game another try.

I'm not a big war gamer, but I've long been searching for a lighter war game with difficult decisions, a small rule book, and a relatively short playing time.  I had hoped that Memoir '44 would be that game, but I found it too random.  Hammer of the Scots did what I wanted.

I love the differences between the Scots and the English- both are powerful, both are frustrating.  The rules are longer than most Euros, but not excessively so.  The game is just plain fun.  I'm giving this one an 8 after one play, it could go higher than that.  I'm very glad that I tried this and may eventually buy more Columbia block games.

This is a first class wargame from Columbia.  It plays quickly, and the rules can be grasped in a few minutes.  After a dozen or more playings, I am still not clear as to what are the best strategies for the two sides, so there seems to be lots of replay value.  The play balance is also good.  All in all, both an exciting game in its own right and a good introduction to the Columbia range.  And a good choice for trying with a non-wargamer.

Very easy to teach, moderately easy to learn. The luck factor is high due to the cards and dice. The production quality is average at best.

A fairly light wargame with high replayability. The victory conditions are pretty unique, since you need to control a majority of Scottish nobles - fighting units that switch sides if they are defeated in battle. My only gripe is that a bad card hand at a critical point in the game can kill you.

I am very impressed that a game could combine such strategy, historical accuracy, and simple, streamlined rules into a fantastic experience.  Everything you want in a wargame is present here, and the game is still intuitive, innovative, and fun to play.  I really like games with some asymmetry to them, and this is a perfect example of that.

I was a little disappointed that there were only two scenarios (3 if you count the campaign), but this really isn't an issue.  The game is really fun to play in either scenario, and there are a lot ways to play those two scenarios.  A great two player game that does a great job of scratching the wargame itch without a long playtime or overly complicated rules.

I'm beginning to think that I am a sucker for games with blocks.  O.k., this is the second Columbia block game I've played.  The first, Crusader Rex, I only played once, and wasn't impressed with.  Hammer of the Scots, though, I thoroughly enjoyed, more so after each of three plays.  It's thoughtful fun but w/o brain burning.  The mechanics are relatively simple, and the basic strategies are easy to grasp, but implementing these strategies is the difficult part.  Wintering punishes the English, and the Scottish ability to recruit during the Wintering phase makes for a nice guerilla war feeling.  Of course, the Scots suffer when it comes to congregating these units due to movement penalties.  So far I've only played the English, and in each game the mid-section of the map saw the most conflict.  

Highlights: in one game the Bruce was a total bad a$$, while Wallace (due to repeated bad rolls) did nothin'.  Oh, and I highly recommend speaking your smack talk with a fake scottish accent while playing.

Edit: After more plays, upped from a 7 to a 9.  SUCH an elegant game with relatively simple rules, but incredibly rich game play.  The two sides play out very differently, but in ways that resonate with the historical contingencies.  Wintering is brutal for the English, making for a big reset at the start of each turn...unless Edward is around.  Wallace is so quick and so strong, that the hit-and-run tactics of the Scots are evident, while simultaneously forced by the movement constraints forced by the terrain.  Speaking of which,the movement constraints are frustratingly brilliant.

RATING: 5
This is the first block game that I have tried.  I really like the damage mechanic to record hits that blocks take, as well as the more obvious "hidden" or "fog of war" aspect that block games bring.  However, this particular game has huge swings in combat.  As much as I like ameritrash games, the dice are just too much of an issue in this game.  In classic ameritrash games, if you roll poorly, yes, you lose.  But, you usually have enough pieces on the board, or they are easy enough to replace to make up for those funky dice rolls.  This is not the case in Hammer of the Scots, where a massacre in a battle is pretty detrimental.  It is extremely hard for the Scots to come back, but fairly easy for the English.  Also, with the wintering of the English forces, they follow the same tactic most of the game.  Run up north as fast as they can, and knock the crap out of Scottish forces.  Not much trickery in it.  Seems pretty straight forward and not a lot of strategy.  It is not without strategy, but there isn't a ton.  Cards can also dictate just how good of a year it is going to be as well.  I like the cards though, as the higher card must play first, allowing the lower card a chance to react.  This can backfire, but for the most part it works.  Will I play it again?  I don't know, there are so many great games out there, and so little time.  Is it worth playing an okay or even above average game when there are great games to play?  That's the question, isn't it?

Exciting medieval war game with different strategies for English and Scottish sides. You can use many tricks to sabotage opponents plans and sometimes the dice turn tables in battles. I have played many times on both sides and lost only once but then it was total wipeout by the English player in just over hour; it has been impossible fo win by Scottish at that time in my matches. Game is well balanced but probably not everyone appreciate so different sides.

RATING: 8
I like block games, as they are essentially games of maneuver where the key decisions are when and where to accept battle with how much forces for how long. This fits perfectly with the hidden information inherent in the block mechanic and the only detriment for my personally is, that I am not a big fan of hidden information games generally. Plus the block mechanic can begin to feel generic as it gets applied to more and more battles and campaigns. But it all works fine in this game hence the rating.

After hearing all of the great things about this game I had to give it a shot. After the first play I just didn't get it, thinking that I was missing some deep underlying subtleties and strategies. It turns out that after several plays I "get it" and there were none of those things that I thought were there. For me it's just "wash, rinse, repeat" and then rely upon the luck of the cards and dice. I can see how a lot of people would really like this game but it just doesn't do it for me. I have yet to play a block game that I'm really crazy about, but I have to caveat that statement with the fact that I've only played a handful of them. Give me hex and counters any day.

The game is much harder than one might think on the first glance. The rules are rather simple. Yet it is one of those games that REALLY require you to think a few moves ahead, as it all seems to come down to the wintering phase. Conquering is of importance for sure, especially of those territories that grant many reinfocement points. But then again, you have to remember the victory conditions, tactical positioning for future activities and the stacking limit. Lots and lots of things to consider.

I can't really say I totally fell in love with it yet. Still, it's one of the games that I'd like to explore further.

Very solid design. I happen to like block games, and this one has the particularly interesting twist that a defeated noble switches sides and battles on. I can see many ways this could play out. Fun. It's also a model of minimalist war game design. I know it's very highly thought of, and perhaps in time, with  more plays, I'll see more in it. Purchased new, April 2009.

This is not a wargame ... this is an adaption of Columbia Games A1 B2 C3 block units mechanism slapped onto a map of England with some movement limits and random cards. I have honestly given this one many tries ... and I still hate it. But ... as you can see by the overall rating ... I pretty much stand alone in this opinion.

I have a regular opponent willing to play so this gets played a lot, mainly because the game is relatively quick playing and fairly simple. The combat is somewhat of a dicefest and the avenues of attack appear limited but the more I play this game the more I can appreciate the potential for various feints and misdirections that the block system gives you.

I enjoyed climbing the tactical learning curve for this one. I liked the concept of limited troops (downtime reduction) and fog of war discovery. I liked the luck of the cards each turn and the planning they required, including the management required to master the year-end reset. I liked the assymetry of the positions, and particularly enjoyed getting better with the Scots after initial thoughts were that the English were overwhelming. Preserve Wallace at all costs and use and re-use the terrain advantages you have. The theme is unusual. All up, enjoyable, but doesn't come out often due to lack of opportunity.

Finally played a complete game and it just keeps getting better. The strategy changes a lot based on which side you play since the English get reinforcements only from England, while the Scots can get them within Scotland. Great mechanics and lots of planning involved. Battles occur based on current strength but both sides can have reinforcements. Also, the wintering helps the Scots regroup, while at the same time bringing fresh troops from England. Very original mechanics and a lot of back and forth.

Game takes about 2.5-3 hours to complete and in comparison to Wizard Kings, I think that this game is much better in terms of game play even though the rules and mechanism is somewhat almost the same. I guess with most type of multiplayer wargames, players tend to be a bit more cautious in attacking another player for fear of a sneak attack from another. I love the 'wintering' part of the game for it makes you plan you moves a few turns in advance.

Hammer of the Scots is a 2-player block wargame that reenacts the Wars of Scottish Independence.  The combat rules for both sides are identical, but the starting positions and unit acquisition work very differently depending on who you are.  Of particular interest is that nobles can switch sides based on their performance in battle and their positioning at the end of the year.  The asymmetries in the game make it pretty interesting, and thus far I've been impressed with the balance between the two sides.

unsure about this one. Seemed ok from the one play I have of it. Need to play more to get a better feel for the game.

Lost horribly as the English. I didn't really understand what needed to be done in order to succeed as them until near the end of the game. It felt like a bit of a slog two thirds of the way through. The game should have been conceded at that point as it was obvious what the out come was going to eventually be.

Seems like a game I would have to be in the mood for. Understanding the history better also helps.

Concerned that the game would become repetitive after 6 plays or so as there seems to be limited strategies to employ. Only further plays will tell.

One thing this game did make me want to do is re-install my Medieval Total War 2 to replay the Scottish rebellion.

HotS is a block wargame, wherein the two players control the British or the Scottish during the time of William Wallace. Players move their units via card play and battles are resolved via dice rolls. There were definitely some intriguing ideas in the game, and I look forward to trying it again. I’m not even really sure how to analyze my experience yet, as my only basis of comparison is the one other block game I’ve played, Commands & Colors Ancients, which is quite a different and lighter beast.

I played the Scots, and as is my wont when learning a new conflict-driven game, I played aggressively and lost quickly. Rather than drawing the Brits to the north and forcing them to face winter, I mustered in the south and was quickly overrun. My buddy has this on his 10x10 challenge list, so we’ll surely get back to it soon.

There are a lot of weird little rules that add to the historical feel.  But boy, howdy, that historical feel makes this a sweeet game!

(1 play)  I'm not sure about this one yet.  It seems like the kind of wargame that I would like, but the first play was pretty bad.  There were enough dice rolls to even out the randomness there, but the cards were WAY out of whack.  Jay drew 6 3-move cards and I drew none, and only 5 2-move cards the whole game, so Jay had about twice as many moves as me.  Couple that with my poor playing and the fact that I have no idea what to do with England when they lose most of their troops every turn (unless you have Edward, which I often didn't) and it was just a killing.  It was effectively over by 1301, but we played a few more turns so I could experiment with Edward.  I'll try again, but a 6 for now.  I didn't have much fun.

Cojonudo, William Wallace repartiendo estopa y los cabrones de los nobles escoceses cambiandose la chaqueta a diestro y siniestro. Mientras tanto Guillermo el Zancudo dirigiendo a sus tropas a la conquista de territorio rebelde. Buen sistema y muy divertido. Los componentes un poco cutres (te sacan 50 Euros por el juego y resulta que el tablero es de cartón de caja de cereales, mierdasecas.......). De todas formas merece bastante la pena.

This is a classic block war game from Columbia games. The topic is itself quite interesting -- I mean, it's basically Braveheart: The Move: The Board game. The game play is tense and interesting decisions are to be found here. It not too hard to learn. A lot of dice rolling, though.

An ok game.  Very different than a conventional wargame, as there usually isn't any sort of stable "front" and your forces disperse every so often to go home.  The rules weren't very laid out and while not overly complicated were more complex than needed I think.  I think the more basic, older block games provide more fun- War of 1812, Napoleon.  Sold my copy of this game away.

After one play, I don't feel compelled to rate this.  Unfortunately, I don't feel compelled to play it again.

Dry, tedious, overly luck-driven game.  It's way too long for what it is.  I will say, the best part was when I almost ended the game before the first year was over.  A failed die roll caused the game to drag on for three more hours....and we only finished 4 years.  Zzzzzz.

Time to give HoTS an 8, and is likely to increase over time.

It's a superb game, my '8' rating reflects my desire to play again.  As I understand, for a wargame, the pieces are top-notch.  In comparison to my euros, they are simply 'OK'.  Flimsy, incomplete board for a 2nd edition.

Nothing a bit of plexi can't handle.  I'm really looking forward to playing this again, and it's opened my eyes to the offerings of Columbia Games.

On order from GameSurplus - June 4 06

Arrived - June 14th.  Great service from these guys. www.gamesurplus.com

Anticipating this game immensely.  I just wish I could have the map that was created by a BGG user.  Still, this will be my first 'block wargame' and, having both Scottish and English roots, I can't wait.

UPDATE:  Applied the stickers, no problem.  For a second edition, why do we have to affix a sticker to an (otherwise) crappy board?  I did it, of course, but some of the ink of the shield wore off on my thumb as I applied it.  That sucks.  I'm glad I didn't pay retail price for it, but I'm still very glad to have it in my collection.  I'm willing to overlook it.

Update:  Played a second game.. Now I'm really getting the rules and can find it pretty easy to teach.  The game isn't as complicated as it sounds/reads.  There is an excellent 'play-by-play' narrative on Columbia Games' website that will help new players grasp the setup and reasoning for play.

Scotland must strike fast to hold off the red wave assult coming from the south.  "Herald" cards are very good things for Scotland to get.  Overlying simplicity with a few 'huh?' rules and points.  Will rate soon.

Quite the game, captures the feel of the Scottish revolution with simpler-than-most wargame rules.  Understandable and enjoyable.  The tug of war for nobles is a great way to make a good game but keep the feel of the Scottish revolution alive.  Battles are resolved simply and the blocks give great fog of war.  This is what Stratego grew up into.  Great game.

RATING: 8
Very interesting asymmetric wargame, that's not too difficult (8 pages of rules - it has a fair bit of stuff thrown in to emulate history more than for gameplay reasons), but is rather abstract. Managing logistics plays a big part, so it's more positioning than sweeping moves - but maybe that's just how we play.

What I like about it is that the victory conditions are clear: you have to make nobles switch allegiance to you, which you primarily do by capturing their home territories and holding them until winter. So there are a lot of objectives to go for, almost all regions are home to a noble, with strategically important locations as main targets.

However, it can be quite static, or feel scripted, and there's plenty of luck. I have the feeling that differences between games are mostly dictated by when someone gets a series of bad die rolls, or receives a great hand, rather than strategic decisions people make.

There's a lot of planning and management. Perhaps you ended last turn in a strong position, but have only four '1' and one '2' move cards for this turn, so what are your objections, how will you take them and also leave your armies in a good position when winter comes at the end of the round, when will you play your '2', how will you respond to what your opponent does, and what's your backup plan if you're unlucky with the dice?

If you like tactical positioning, managing your army, capturing nobles, rolling dice and asymmetric warfare, give Hammer of the Scots a try.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Elements of the game reminded me of We the People, especially the switching back and forth of allegiances, and the attrition effects of winter on army units. Hammer does things alittle smoother and less fiddly than WtP, yet still suffers from some rule vagaries (for simulation effect) to take into consideration, which overwhelmed me. My first game took 3 hours after rule explanation and only made it through 3/4 of the way into Braveheart scenario. During that time, executed some interesting military manoeuvres as well as William Wallace. I found each year resolution of noble re-setting and unit re-charging less of a book keeping chore though a tad repetitive, with no sense of game development; I left feeling 2 rounds would have been just as effective, but obviously you should play all the years to rewrite history. Historically rich experience game, with alot of factors to consider as part of the strategy, though too long for my gaming circles taste.

I like how the block system provides limited fog of war. The cards capture the difficulties of mounting a campaign. It also shows the shifting alliances of the Scottish nobles. Both sides play differently and have different strengths so it is a well done asymmetrical conflict.

This is a fairly straight forward block game for an intro to that genre. There are a number of one-offs in the rules and they are not the most well organized, but work well enough as they are only 8 pages. I find that the game has a lot of back and forth between the sides from year-to-year. This would be ok, except the previous years don't seem to have a huge impact on the current year. Thus it almost feels like the first years are just warm up until you get to the final year and try to push to claim enough nobles for the win.

Easy rules and interesting setting. The bluff factor due to the blocks seems limited to me, at least in my games. Everything seems to revolve around the control of the bottleneck in the middle so it seems that each game develops quite similar... (but that might just be our group think)

RATING: 7
Notable for easy rules, fast card play and low counter (block) density. Downside is chess-like abstract feel,  low historical flavour and my least favourite combat system - roll one dice for each strength point. Means lots of dice to resolve combat. I just like getting it over and done with quickly. Would continue to play, but not a prefered wargaming system.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
One of my early favorites and still a top choice overall. Both sides play a card, then each moves units, then the attacks are resolved. Pinning units is a key to keeping reinforcements in check. The mechanic for nobles switching sides really sets this one apart and gives it excellent re-playability. Like most of the Columbia Games, HotS is low in complexity and high in strategy. Would play anytime.

RATING: 8
The first real wargame that I've tried to play.  Took about two plays before we got all of the rules down.  The rules probably could have been organized better.  We missed the fact that nobles defend at 3 instead of 2 because it was in a side note about nobles instead of in the main part of the rules.  Worth the effort though.  I had to email Columbia for some replacement blocks because about six of mine were too rough not to be picked out amongst the others.  They promptly sent me the blocks no questions asked.

This one didn't disappoint, great 2-player strategy with a strong historical theme of the era. A bit of luck included, but it keeps the game fresh. I suggest getting the latest manual and FAQ from columbiagames.com and playing the game with the Schiltroms optional rule (it's in the manual) to even it a bit for the Scots. Wooden units are nice, but the map's quality is weak so I use a plexiglass on top if it.

RATING: 4.5
Maybe it would have helped if I had gotten into the historical wargammer mindset, but I'm not really a wargammer.  So, as a game, this was fairly disappointing.  Play a card, move some armies, roll some dice, rotate some tiles, roll more dice, move a few more tiles around, and then reset most tiles (wintering).  Repeat.  It didn't really appeal to me.  It felt like an Ameritrash/Wargame hybrid.  Kind of the worst of both worlds.  Oh, and it's a bit too long for what it is.

RATING: 7
It depicts the Scottish military struggle for independence against the Englishmen in a two-player only affair. A great design idea that is the reference regarding the genre of block wargames. The use of blocks for concealment of unit information from the opponent is possibily the best boardgame mechanic of fog-of-war and it is certainly one of my favorite mechanics in any boardgame genre, together with card-driven actions. In spite of some constraints of strategic options derived from the geography of the playing map, it still packs good tactical depth. The scenarios also add to its replayability, besides giving options of faster gaming sessions.

A really good game.  I wish the quality of the board and cards where higher, but the play is spectacular.  I also have one of the older prints (first?) of it and havent seen the new productions, but hear they look great.  The newer maps look much better.  The play is fantastic and I wish I could play it more, with experienced players.   Could be rated a ten for the balance of game play.  Components is really what brought my rating down; although, I'll be keeping my edition and not getting a newer one.

Apart from my own Europe Engulfed, this is my favorite block game.  Very accessable, fun to play, and a fantastic gateway game to get non-wargamers into the hobby. My only slight problem with the game is the ability of units to 'retreat' forward through enemy held territory. Once you accept that this is the way it is and both players are aware of it though, then there is no unfair advantage gained and play is simply built around this 'movement rate acceleration' anomoly.

Great game Jerry - Bring on Crusader Rex!

Woohaa! I can only wish all my next wargames will be as fun to learn and play like this one! Low unit count, real fog of war, few and simple mechanics yet so much depth and theme. The playing is totally assimetrical for each side and yet balanced. It's just fun, fun, fun. The time just flies away! The more I play it, the more I love it.

I have enjoyed all of the Columbia block games that I have played so far but this one is my favorite.  Just remember to keep the Welsh home, they are unreliable as all get out.  Popular with my 9YO son - we've been playing each other for about a year - he is better at remembering the rules than I am.  If you are looking for one block game for your collection give HOTS a serious look.

This is a simple wargme. In a lot of ways it feels more like an abstract game, especially something like Stratego or LotR: Confrontation. Victory is determined by controlling more of the Scottish Nobles than your opponent.These switch sides if you gain control of their home territory or if you defeat them in battle. The game does a very clever job of simulating the way that Medieval warfare did not have static lines in the way modern warfare does. Actions can proceed across the whole of Scotland, often with isolated outposts for or against one side or the other.

I would rate it even higher (8+?) if not for the poor quality of the game components (e.g. uncoated playing cards with clip-art icons and unrounded corners). Much of this game's draw is the history involved. I don't think sales would have suffered if they raised the price another $5-10 and gave you a mounted mapboard, at least as nicely designed as the fan made maps available here on the BGG.

RATING: 4
Given the high ratings and even higher praise heaped on this one I was very keen to try it but wow, is this thing over-rated. The people who rate this exercise in turgidity a ten really really really should get out a little more. It fails on all counts bearing more resemblance to the Battle of The Somme (or perhaps Korea after the mobile phase had played out given the need to guard against armoured break throughs and amphibious end-runs) than medieval warfare in general, let alone Wallace's rebellion in particular. Apparently Medieval generals who wanted to expedite their army's movement looked around for somebody to attack as the elan of it all would carry them further than if they just prosaically marched in that direction. What an elegant insight into the medieval mind.

As a game it is unbelievably repetitive and even in terms of the invariably dopey output of Columbia Games relies on one of the most deterministic, confining, straight-jacketed systems known to gamedom to get it function at a level where the players think that they are actually doing something and that what they are doing involves a close contest of skill. In fact, like so much of Columbia's output, the game is in control of them rather than vice-versa. To play the English in this thing is to know what twenty-years-to-life would feel like. Same set of basic level tasks, again and again and again with the knowledge that if you act out these pointless stations of your own personal cross the authorities (game) might just let you win. Of course much of what I dislike about the game actually describes the more popular (but sadly dumber) Euros (especially the mechanism whereby enforced universal mediocrity is passed off as close, intelligent play) and I suspect that it is from this sector that most of the 10-raters come. "Mummy mummy, I just did play a real live wargame! Ise a big boy now!" Sorry dopey, but not even close.

Both sides are very different so require different playing styles to do well.  I like that in a game.  In addition, the winter rules require that one carefully plan ahead to maximize gains (minimize losses) at year's end.  A nice balancing act between offense and defense.

I hate to be a naysayer, but this game just didn't do it for me.  It was much, much too fiddly for such a light wargame.  It's very repetitive (each season you fight a few battles and then set up camp for winter, then start all over again the next spring).  I didn't think the strategy was all that deep, and the dice played too strong a role in the outcome of battles.  Also, too much retreating for my taste.

2018-02-06: [i]Finally[/i] played this after years of playing many other Columbia block games and somehow missing out on Hammer of the Scots. :)

I see why it is so popular. Good fun, the rules seem pretty clear, interestingly asymmetrical situation, nice that it has 2 separate scenarios which can also be combined into a longer campaign. The way nobles go home each winter and switch allegiance if the enemy controls their home is an interesting twist from other Columbia games.

Randomness can be decisive (e.g. in my first game we're tied 7-7 in the final turn, and I play the Herald card which gives me a 2/3 probability of converting an enemy noble to my side -- that would have let me win 8 to 6 ... and I fail the roll, [i]again[/i], after trying and failing with that card 4 or 5 times in our game! But I don't mind in a historical wargame like this. :)

I have played this game 3 times and the strategy was already known after the 1st gameplay. This made the game not enjoyable for further playing. It is nice to create a game that you can play fast and within 2 hours, however if the gameplay is not matched and the strategic dept is known after 1 round there is no further challenge in playing the game. The penalty for the British in the winter is too harsh so the Scottish can easily walk through any resistance.

Really great game that I've had a hell of a time getting accustom to. Being the first block game that I played, the intricate mechanics and fine-tuned scenarios were immediately apparent, but strategy seemed to escape me. I love the battle mechanics of unit priority, retreat and dice throwing. There also seems to be great strategic depth in knowing what card to play at the beginning of each round.

The first edition components are perfectly serviceable, but the 3rd edition map has really caught my eye. It's too bad the map isn't mounted, such a classic certainly deserves better treatment. I look forward to refining my strategy as to avoid being trounced each game.

First impression (two games):
Both players first-timers for a block-game; my "english" opponent with A&A-experience, and myself with preferance for Chess when it's about two-player games.
We did the Braveheart-scenario, and it was great fun - with both parts on the offence several times during the game (The Scots won an important battle in the last year, and a noble-controlling-victory).
It took a long time, with many rules-questions as we went, but both players enjoyed this first game - and there will be more!

RATING: 6.3
--May2005-- I think the (relatively) low rating is more a reflection of me than the game.  The game is good - really good, even.  But I haven't enjoyed it the last couple plays.  I might blame too many consecutive useless rolls of the dice; but I guess I really prefer games where the luck/skill balance is a bit more on the deterministic side.
--May2006-- That paragraph doesn't read correctly to me.  Perhaps it made sense when I originally wrote it, but far more likely I just lack my wife's skill with prose.

As far as I can tell, I don't really have a problem with luckfests, or prefer "games where the luck/skill balance is a bit more on the deterministic side."  I think the fundamental difficulty with HotS (and its sibling Crusader Rex) begins with ineptitude in the genre.  My perception that I get "too many useless rolls of the dice" may simply be the result of attempting things that any sensible Grognard would not try - and, naturally, I fail.  As a result, my complaint is more about my lack of traction:  I don't know what I'm doing wrong, and all I perceive is that the things I try fail.  And what I prefer is a game in which I can perceive the vector along which improved play is possible.

I've always loved game with cool miniatures so I never thought I'd enjoy a block game. I found this one online for a great price and decided to give it a try after reading all the great reviews.

Fun, tense, balanced, covering an interesting period and playable in an evening.  I'm dropping my rating slightly after some more plays.  While I enjoy the block mechanics and the ability to flip nobles without fighting them, it seems like the unit density is too low, and the map too constrained, so it's not that difficult to keep track of what is where.  Still a great game, but there are others in the genre that make better use of hidden information.

Birthday present, wanted it for the theme.
I like blockgames, or rather blocks, no fiddling about with stacks of counters.

My eldest likes blockgames too but it took some time for us to play this.
We didn't like Richard III that much, because in that game things seem to resest themselves which make previous turns pointless.

But this one is much more fun and we really enjoyed it.

I like everything about this game. Except for the inevitable crushing despair I feel when rolling dice over and over.

Before the game started I did a little experiment. I rolled a single die ten times to see how many hits on a 1-3 I could get. I think I got a single hit on my tenth roll. Dice hate me.

I own a couple other block games that I want to try, but this one might be a front runner for the one I would keep.

Light and accessible, and more a Euro than a wargame (colourful bits, and your units are captured or recycled rather than being eliminated).

I liked not having to roll as many dice as in other block games, but without the irritation of a CRT.

RATING: 7
I'm comparing this to Rommel, the only other blockgame (and wargame for that matter) I have played (but I consider LotR: Confrontation a kind of blockgame too :)). What I prefer in Hammer is the ABC combat mechanism (instead of everything in the defender's force firing first in Rommel), and the slightly higher production values (blocks are bigger and the symbols on them are prettier). Apart from that I prefer everything in Rommel. Rommel demands combined arms in your forces to get the DF bonus against particular enemy forces. Also I find the combined arms makes better use of the hidden element of the blocks. You need to guess what composition the enemy forces are to bring the right counter units. Like in LotR: Confrontation, one of the most fun parts is guessing where the orcs are to hit them with Gimli (and the other match-ups). You don't get this at all in Hammer, as the units are either just good or bad. Its like playing LotR: Confrontation if none of the pieces had special abilities. One of the main differences in units (apart from ability to hit the enemy), is the ABC part, allowing the enemy to run away before taking too many hits. I always play the English in Hammer, and I just sit there praying for the hardest hitting block though. If you don't draw the good units for the levy and get dealt a hand of crap you lose the game, and there is nothing you can do about it. In Rommel if you don't get enough supply to pull off a decent attack you can use one move to set yourself up for a lot of withdrawals, then can save up your supply cards for later and save your BPs so you can buy more. Reinforcements might turn up 1 turn early, but at least you can count on them coming to help. The two places where Rommel really shines over Hammer for me though is a) the depth of strategy, and b) the fluidity of the game. I've played Hammer 4 times now and I kind of think I've seen every strategy. I've played Rommel the same number of times and just love the diversities of strategy. Armoured pushes straight down the highway or recon dashes along the desert trails. Pinning enemy forces in place with a small force, while a larger mobile group dashes around the side to cut the supply lines. Putting recon/mobile force up front as bait, then withdrawing (hopefully speed 3-4 won't take much pursuit fire) to force the enemy to burn supply. That leaves tactics in Hammer of the Scots, but I don't like the stop-start nature of thought that goes on in Hammer. In Rommel you have your strategy in mind, quickly look at the new hand of supply you get, then pretty much know what you're doing for that game month so the game runs smoothly. In Hammer I draw a new hand and sit there for 5-10 minutes working out a complete new strategy from the last game year, because my hand and levy draw is totally different from the year before. Then you *really* have to react to your opponent's moves, basically making me rewrite my strategy after every move taken. It makes the game too much stop-start for me. I'm not saying tactical thought and reacting to your opponent's moves is a bad thing, but in other games where you do this (e.g. Rommel and LotR: Confrontation) its much more 'fluid'. I guess I prefer games where you go in thinking "I'm going to try out this strategy in this game", and you put your strategy against your opponent's, tactics playing a part but not over-riding your strategy all the time. The games I get annoyed with are those where short-term tactical necessities keep stopping you from employing your strategy (e.g. War of the Ring, Hammer of the Scots).

Another impulse buy...Columbia Games is having a 25% off sale, and this one gets such rave reviews, as well as being talked about as a great first wargame.  Replayable, too.  

[Update] So after buying this one on impulse, I'm glad I did.  I give this one an 8 based on the given criteria, although this is after only 2.5 plays, one of which was solo. (The half game ended when my roommate was dragged away to Europe mid-game, but it ended satisfyingly enough: a battle royale with Edward II and Wallace.  In the third round, Edward II was the only unit of six left, and he had only one point left on him when he retreated, bruised and battered.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A really fine game with lots of clever mechanisms in the play. The cards being a combination of movement flexibility and turn order works very well. I think the three block battle designations with different strengths is a big improvement over earlier efforts like The War of 1812. Light rules help make it fun to play too. Fantastic.

After my first couple of games I thought the Scots couldn't win. I didn't see how it could be done. Now, after a few more plays I think the game is balanced, but sure, it's still hard for the Scots to win. The trick is surviving the year following Edward wintering in Scotland. He's got this enormous force and you have to change the way you've been fighting up to that point. Avoid battles. Play any event cards early and try and end the year. Survive! If you can get through the year battered but not beaten then you're back in the fight. The English have failed in their big push and the Scots (if they've managed to build up by retaining some of their good winter positions), can be on the offensive again. This is the bit I love most about the game - the ebb and flow. A newbie mistake is for the Scot player to try and go on the offensive against Edward. There's no point unless you can kill him off. Otherwise you're just taking hits against an opponent who's not sticking around anyway. The Scots are only interested in the Nobles - retaining them and converting them. Avoid the Archers, Knights and Infantry. They're just there to beat you up and they love a fight. Sure, you will have to fight them, but when you do make sure you do so from a position of strength. Use the mountains. Use the north. Watch out for the English sailing up behind you - that's always a pain.

There's more, but off the top of my head they're the main things I learned the hard way. The Scots require a little more finesse than the English, but they're definitely in the running.

RATING: 7
First experience with block tactical wargames.  This one feels like a game of timing and back and forward.  Knowing when to attack and when to retreat in order to put your forces in a stronger position for later turns seems to be crucial.  The real battle is fought around Mentieth and Atholl.  The one that ends the game with those territories normally will win. Looks like it is harder to learn to play right with the Scottish, as the English are more straight forward to use.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A medium weight 2-player war game re-creating Braveheart, or the Bruce battle.  Always feels like you are outnumbered, since you cannot see the strength of your opponents.  A wonderful "wintering" mechanism, where after so many turns, troops must return to the homeland to recover for winter.  As England is a long ways away, English troops must conquer lands that can handle them, so they can stay clsoe by for spring.  Rules for king-making and -killing add a level of complexity and priorities that make the hide-and-seek a little more important than simply "go for an area" style of war-games.  Requires the traditional war-gamers plexiglass sheet for board support.

Some games don't live up to the hype or the BGG ratings, but this one does.  Just a great game. I'm sold on the Columbia Block System mechanic. 

The map depicted as areas works perfectly, and the blocks provide the perfect strategic setting for limited intel of your opponent.  The action phase through cards nicely does away with the standard U-go-I-go system that can hinder some games and allows players to seize the first move throughout the turn as opposed to either one a turn or not at all.

A lot of interesting and well-themed mechanics in here. I can see why so many of my GeekBuddies enjoy this game. There are quite a number of rules and exceptions packed into a thin (for a wargame) rulebook, but they're well-connected and mostly believable. There is some luck in the battles (dice) and yearly actions (cards) that can shape some critical moments, but more often than not the they seem to balance out. Good, immersive game.

Excellent introductory wargame! The map and pieces are visually very appealing and the gameplay is tense, interesting and varied. The mechanics of the blocks (fog of war) and the cards as well as the initiative-based battle system make for a real winner in my books. The wintering rules are fascinating and forces some great gameplay decisions.

I've been wanting to enjoy a good block wargame for a while, and finally found an accessible one in Hammer of the Scots. It's not just the simple ruleset: the graphic design of the map and blocks is very clear, making it much easier to focus on the game, unlike a lot of other block wargames (especially Columbia Games' own shit-pile of graphic design: Rommel in the Desert).

The objective (basically capture-the-flag, but the flags run all over the place) and premise are both very unique. The asymmetry of the sides really conveys the different tactics employed by the brutish English and the raiding Scots. The winter rules and block mobility give this game a lot of motion and daring attacks, and introduce fluidity in the board situation. Axis & Allies-style combat is also very easy to grasp. I groaned when trying to internalize all the thematic 'flavor rules', but was pleasantly surprised to find that the Bruce scenario is devoid of them, and is a great entry point for two newbies. The Braveheart scenario is where the fun is at though, because of William Wallace and Edward's decision on whether to winter.

Currently a little worried about the rich-get-richer syndrome, due to the leader obtaining more build points, and the Scots getting more powerful units if they're winning. Only hope is the cards favor you, which brings me to the worry that between experienced players, it's all about what cards you draw. Some deck management would have been cool. Otherwise, still having a lot of fun exploring the game.

[11 plays] (Only twice with "The Bruce" scenario - also a very solid scenario, while perhaps not as fully dynamic.)

A wonderful member of the Columbia block games. This and Liberty are the best in my opinion. Which one you like better may just be a matter of which period of history you think is more interesting. HotS has very interesting mechanics with the seasonal return of nobles to their homelands, English feudal levy, and castle wintering limits. This is a very nifty game.

Maybe I'm not getting this game: it feel extremely repetitive. The dicefest aspect I can handle but the limited options with the cards just makes it feel lacking. I like the historical aspect of it though.

A neat game, that the kids and I like.  I enjoy the difference in strategy in playing both sides and the excitement of a pitched battle is great for the kids.  I am, however, disappointed in the quality of the components, especially for the price.  Board resembles cerealbox cardboard and the cards began  completely falling apart after about 5-6 plays.  It would have been nice to have an &quot;Edward I&quot; and an &quot;Edward II&quot; block, after all, the game costs 50 bucks!

Kicsit hamar véget ért az első játék ezzel a játékkal, de valószínűleg nem minden szabályt tudtunk pontosan. Ettől függetlenül jó játéknak tűnik. A skótok az angolokkal harcolva a skót nemeseket többségét próbálják saját maguk mellé állítani. Természetesen főleg kockadobásból áll a játék, ennek ellenére bőven érdekesebb egy Risknél.
Második játékra már sokkal kiegyensúlyozottabb volt, de még mindig az angolokkal érezhetően könnyebb. Ami még a játék hátránya lehet, hogy úgy érzem így két játék után, hogy nagyon egyértelmű stratégiák vannak mindkét fél számára.

A couple things of note: I am not a war gamer, nor am I a huge fan of dice heavy games.  So for this to get an 8 is quite impressive.  

Well, first I'm a sucker for theme and this really conveys the story nicely.  Where this game really gets me is with the card manangement.  I find that it really levels the luck with the dice.  I'm sure that the more I play this (and I most definately will play this more) the deeper the  strategies will be revealed.  

I can't say that I would buy this but would be glad to play if a friend brought it over.  One of the best 2 player games.

Update: I downgraded this to a 7 only because, while I recognise its brilliance, after playing Bobby Lee I've never had any desire to play it again.

Man this game is addictive! So incredibly intense, and a whole lot to think and strategize about when not playing.

HotS is almost too much.

I think after a few more plays this game will be going up to 10. It is that good! *2011-07-31

There's more here than meets the eye; the fickle nobles and the wintering rules pose some nice strategic puzzles. The system is polished and efficient except for a few fiddly rules (e.g. Celtic solidarity, French knights) that add some historical flavor but not much play value. The version 1.2 rules clarify some important points. All in all, I'm happy to have purchased this as a re-entry into block games.

I can't say anything too intelligent about this game as it since I've only played once and it's the only real wargame I've played in years. However, I really liked the game and how each side played differently, how you have uncertainty as far as reinforcements, how there is some but not a lot of memory in the game, and how there are some blocks that are completely different in how they operate. Very cool game.

This is my favourite of the Columbia block games although I have yet to play the classic Eastfront which I recently purchased cheaply on eBay.  (I aim to play it soon though).

The artwork on the blocks and the chunkiness of the 25mm blocks themselves make this game very aesthetically pleasing.  The map is heavy cardboard stock like all the offerings from Columbia Games.  For eurogamers who are accustomed to deluxe mounted maps in linen paper finish this can be a bit of a disappointment.  

The game itself is absolutely gripping.  It is a tight struggle between the resolute Scots and the larger English army with the wintering rules making logistics tight too.

RATING: 7.5
2005: 1 play, English.
A war game without all those damn chits, and a very elegant way to deal with troop strengths (and fog of war, although I'm not enough of a wargamer to care about that). Want to try it again, as the Scottish! Unfortunately, I don't think Mary would every play it, and I have enough 2er games sitting on the shelf already!

2014: 1 play, Scottish
It only took 9.4 years to try the other side! It was still quite good. Of course, I don't remember enough about that first play to compare sides, but playing as the Scots and having Wallace running around swinging at stuff sure was fun!

2014: 3 more plays (both sides)
Definitely a good game, at least a 7.5. I'd love to play this more regularly with someone of similar skill, so we could both improve at the same pace.

This is just about the right weight of war game for me. I really like the card-driven style of the game, the simple movement rules, and even the Wintering -- feels so thematic while also being a cool game mechanism! Both sides have to play very differently. I even like the combat system: a pretty simple way to reflect the relative skills of various troop types ... nice!

[b]--- Rules Summary ---[/b]
Play one of 2 shorter scenarios, or both together as a long one. Each has a defined setup where players place blocks for nobles in their starting regions, as well as some troops (possibly). 

Each year, shuffle the entire deck (5 event cards with various effects, and 20 movement cards numbered 1-3) and deal 5 per player. In each of 5 rounds, players simultaneously choose and play a card. If both play an event card, the year ends immediately. With one event card, it resolves then the other player goes. With 2 movement cards, the player with the higher card goes first (ties go to English). Each movement point allows you to activate one group (all units in a region), which can split up and go separate -- red borders only allow 2 to cross, green allow 6. Must stop moving immediately if cross red border, or if enter space with enemy -- battle occurs.

In battle, players reveal their blocks. Troops are A/B/C rank, have skill 1-4, and have 1-4 hit points. As attack first, then Bs, then Cs; within each group, defender goes first. When a block's turn is up, it may either retreat, attack, or pass. When attacking, it rolls as many d6 as its hit points, and hits when it rolls any number no higher than its skill. Defender allocates hits to their blocks, evenly (those with more HP get hit first). If no winner after 3 complete battle rounds, attacker must retreat. If you defeat a noble, it changes sides (English/Scottish) and comes in at 1 HP next battle round.

After 5 rounds, must Winter: all nobles return home (English first); if occupied by enemy, they change sides! Then, check every region's max capacity; excess troops lost. All troop losses (here or in battle) go to your reserve pool, randomized face down. Finally, spend muster points in every region to heal nobles and/or recruit troops from the rest pool (up to region's capacity).

Continue playing through years, advancing through to scenario end. Then, the player controlling more nobles wins. You can also win during the game by sudden death (killing Scottish King, or Edward II).

04/05/08 - after 3 plays:

There's something strange about this game. It has everything I don't like: Randomness, hidden information, direct interaction (attack) and the theme is not that great. I don't even know why I bought it, but I'm glad I did because it's very fun to play and the "all package" is very atractive and streamlined. 

Usually I don't like dice and I still get very, very angry when they don't help me at all but among all the games I've played so far, I guess the average is fair enough to think that winning Hammer of the Scots could be done without being the most lucky guy.

I also like the surprise ending of an year. That's very cool because it adds caos in a very controled way. I mean we all know that  it could happen at any time if you play an event card!

My first game was simply not fun. While the rules seem well ordered and complete, I found many basic details to be elusive. We misinterpreted and guessed our way through a painful and overly long game. Thankfully another friend eagerly dug into the rules and online discussion.

Great two-player.

English levy variations and lucky/unlucky card hands can sometimes tilt game a bit too much (to either side). But a great game anyway.

After some experience it seems the scottish are at the advantage. However the english player should never give up even if the situation looks hopeless.

In the Bruce-scenario the english situation seems hopeless (if the scotts are played right).

I don't own a lot of good two player games that take over an hour to play, so this fit very nicely into that niche.  Have only played the Braveheart scenario and the campaign, but I feel the game is nicely balanced with plenty of choices.  I would play this anytime.  Also, the rules are much simpler and better written than for many other wargames.  Highly recommended especially if you have trouble getting multi-player games together.

One minor complaint is that I might have preferred to have a few more blocks to contribute to variety.

Very accessible block wargame. The rules are concise (8 pages), well laid out and easy to follow. The game is themed around the Anglo/Scots wars of the late 13th/early 14 centuries and the main aim is to have control of the most Scottish nobles by the end of the game. The way the two sides play is very different - the English have strength in numbers and generally greater combat power. The Scots are better equipped to deal with the effects of winter when certain numbers of units have to leave the board before the next turn/year begins. It's a greater challenge to play as the Scots as it requires more imagination when devising tactics, but overall the two sides have a reasonably even opportunity to be victorious. One of the best lighter wargames I've played.

I took it easy on him mid-game. Big Mistake! He crowned King Balliol and with Wallace just about wiped me off the board :( Terffic game.

Very neat, VERY different block game.  Not a killing spree like a lot of wargames; more of a sometimes-subtle power struggle.  At this point, I'd say it's easy to play, but difficult to master.

RATING: 8
A nice 2-player strategy game. The one-sided blocks are a nice way to simulate "fog of war" and unit strength.
Beginners might find it hard to remember all the special rules, like crowning a king etc.
There is quite a portion of luck involved because of the action card draws for unit movement and dice rolls for combat. But you still have the feeling that you could count bad luck in as well, and position your blocks accordingly.
That nobles returning home for winter might switch sides is a neat mechanic and allows players to try to get back what they lost.

RATING: 6
Its certainly a good game but strategies elude me at this time and because of the way the nobles keep swapping sides it can seem like its just back and forth with no progress.  Im sure that's just inexperience tho.

Seems like quite a few little rules to remember.

Really like the blocks and look of the game.

RATING: 7.5
I loved this game when I first played it, and while I still enjoy it, I've soured on it somewhat as I've played it more. I've seen far two many Scottish sudden death victories, even in the Braveheart scenario!  Perhaps the learning curve is higher for the English, or perhaps I and the people I play against just don't 'get' the strategy for playing Longshanks, but in my experience, Hammer of the Scots rarely produces games that are close and tense, or indeed, even run, right to the end.

RATING: 9
Rating after two plays.  The only thing preventing this game from being one I would play anytime is the duration.  Although I have read that some people can crank out a game in two hours, both of mine (with the same opponent), have been close to four.  In fact, the second game ended at 3.5, in 1301 (it was probably going to end in the next year, and he didn't want me to get the Scottish king, so he just conceded).  Otherwise, this is a great game, lots of stuff to think about.

I've played twice as the Scots. The game seems like it might be too long for what it is. The mid-board choke point limits play. I need to try again. I currently much prefer the more recent Julius Caesar from the same line of block games.

*Rating based on only one play*

Having heard a lot about HotS, I had to pick it up.  I worked through the game with a friend and liked it pretty well.  The hidden unit mechanic worked well for both of us.  Also, keeping track of unit strengths was a clever system as well.  Only having played it once, I haven't had the chance to really delve into the strategy much.  I think the rating will increase with further play.

I was expecting a light wargame with a "Frreeedommm!!" theme but what I got was a light war-cum-realpolitick-game that manages to capture the historical situation really very well. Simply taking ground is not enough as you're not just trying to conquer/defend Scotland, but rather trying to secure the allegiance of the vacillating Scottish nobles. The problem is that it's a bit too well balanced, which may cause the game to feel a bit repetitive.

I've played this two or three times now (forgot to record a few plays), and it's an ok game, but I don't think it's as good as it's made out to be.

Maybe I'm just so used to controlled randomness that the dice rolls really bother me now.  Most of the games that I play have limited randomness, or randomness that can be somewhat controlled, which I really like.  The dice rolling in this game just seems so arbitrary.  No matter how good your strategy, you can still get F'ed by the dice.

The wily Scots slip in and out of battles and castles while the stout English march ahead slowly and inexorably at the side of their King.

I am only interested in the 3rd edition.  This is a really nice game with some interesting twists on the Columbia game mechanics.  Attackers going first in combat makes for some interesting aggressive tactics.  The cards force you to make strategic decisions on how you will attempt to play out the year with some randomness that keeps things up in the air until the end.  The best laid plans only last until the enemy is met in this game.

Culled - First wave; Charity auction

Why we culled it: Braveheart remains, to this day, my sentimental pick for "favorite movie of all time". I leapt at a chance to own a game based on these historic events. I picked up a copy of the 2nd Edition and it sat unopened for a long time. Once I cracked it open, I found exactly what was advertised - a block wargame - which was a thing I had no concept of at the time I ordered it. Block wargames involve placing actual blocks on a map, and the blocks are stickered on the back side with unit descriptions, so that your opponent knows where you may have a presence, but has no idea of what that presence might actually be. A neat system in general, and HotS is a fine implementation of it. Sadly, it also doesn't really connect with my group, and my one proper wargaming friend already owns a copy (and has since moved far away). So I passed this copy on to a better home, but continue to love Braveheart. Good times.

RATING: 8
This is the first Columbia block war game, and second ever block game. I purchased Strike of the Eagle first, mostly due to theme, the hotness around Strike's recent reviews, and cost (Strike was about $15-$20 cheaper... !!).

First impression was a huge let down. Components... paper map? Oh. OK, I stand corrected: card stock. Right, so if you're comparison is a chit and counter game where paper maps (sometimes without color) are common and where the entire production is a spartan affair with grognards seemingly to almost take pride in the crumby components because "it's all about gameplay", then yeah Columbia Games uses "high quality components". Compared to my own standards of what constitutes "high quality", however, (Napoleon's Triumph, Polis, Friedrich, etc), not so much. The box (sleeve), the rulebook, the map (can't call it a "board"), and even the pieces felt... cheap and amateurish. Like a DIY production. Did I make a mistake? I paid over $60 USD for this game, not counting shipping. Worse, I had only JUST gotten Strike of the Eagle, one of the highest quality component games I've seen, especially if considering overall value, and that game was not only the same genre and mechanics family, but is a wonderful integration of so many block game concepts along with concepts new to block games (I didn't know that at the time, I just thought Hammer seemed underwhelming in comparison). So it was a perfect storm for a let down.

I almost returned it. But I turned to BGG and read some reviews. I felt reassured. I wasn't the only one who was coming to the hobby from this angle and who was disappointed, rather than impressed, by the Columbia Games component quality. But person after person said the gameplay was worth it. And... well... IT IS! Trying to just work through the rules for a 20 minutes before bed turned into a 2 hour solo game (cut short) that sucked me in and left me transfixed (is cognitive flow the academic term to apply here?).

This is the grand daddy of games like Julius Caesar, Crusader Rex, and, more recently, Richard III and playing this game shows why Hammer commands so much respect. The cool thing about Columbia Games is how they have a consistently simple rule set, with consistent core ideas and mechanics, but always with twists, tweaks, and additions that fit and best represent the subject matter and setting. It's more than "historical flavor" it's real evocation of that history, of the problems and processes involved. That, for me, is enough to say this is as much as simulation as the biggest, most-hardcore, beast of a wargame imaginable. 

The game has a characteristic that I tend to look for in games, my wargames and strategy games in particular: it is sublime. It's also cerebral, but here the cerebral seems to stem from the subliminal and then vice versa in a kind of synergy. The result is something majestic, yet subdued. I will refrain from using the word "elegant" since that's not en-vogue these days and since I would withhold that title for games that just cannot be said to be anything less, games like Napoleon's Triumph or Friedrich--but the word does come to mind here, just due to the nice to and fro of the strategic situation produced by this game. There's a sort of dance across a changing landscape. Things are never quite stable, but always seeming to fall short of a real tipping... a balance of imbalance. Until the end. Something equally true of the other best Columbia block games I mentioned, but this was the predecessor, so credit should go where it is truly due. 

That this game takes as long as it does is a bit of a let down. For me, I couldn't imagine finishing it in LESS than 2-3 hours, and 3-4 is more likely. I'm a slow move-maker and a ponderous fellow that likes to slowly chew my food, sip my wine (although I sip often!) and savor my gameplay decisions as I make them. I'm sure quicker players who are very fluent in the rules can breeze through in the box-stated time frame no problem, but to me why play a game to rush through it? It's sold as a "quick playing" game, which is an understatement when compared to Empire of the Sun, but not really true at all if you're comparing it to Commands & Colors Ancients. It's not very long compared to very long games, but it's not short enough to be called quick in my opinion. The whole "can be finished in a single day" as a selling point thing is laughable to me--I have an 18 month old, if I can find an hour or 2 to myself, I'm lucky.

Julius Caesar and Crusader Rex are both shorter (maybe 20-30% shorted, depending) and a tad simpler in the rules nuances. Hammer's rules aren't bad at all,  but there are more specific rules dingle-berries than you will find in those others. I've heard the same about Richard III, but can't attest to that. Those games are also said to be more fluid, less of a war of attrition, but no game about this subject that didn't capture the guerrilla war feel of the conflict would be true to history, so this is not really a flaw, just something to be aware.

So not only didn't I return this game, I placed a

Un jeu intéressant, mais je n'arrive absolument pas à discerner la stratégie et les tactiques à utiliser. Elles ne sont pas intuitives, et devoir tenir compte de tous les facteurs (en particulier les regroupements et l'hivernage en général) est plutôt casse-tête.

En plus, le Norse block me rend fou (plein d'exceptions pour une unité qui n'a pas de justification historique). Un-historical chrome in a wargame is something surprising.

Suggestions pour la prochaine partie : jouer sans le Norse block (compenser peu-être avec la règle optionnelle schiltrons)

Only played it once, so take the rating with a grain of salt. Also, it had a lot of hype to live up to. In the end, the hidden movement feature of the game was compromised by the fact that nobles start in their home areas (and tend to remain close), meaning your opponent has a good idea who he/she's up against.

A well-balanced block game where the stakes usually seem palpable.  Having to gain control of the Scottish nobility and been limited to the movement restrictions of different areas mean that it is necessary to act with a certain degree of care.  Luck is always a factor in war games, but even with a weak hand, it is possible for a good player to avoid a catastrophe and await a more favorable set of cards.

Not a huge disppointment but a disappointement nonetheless.
The game is very repetitive & strategic options are too limited.
To gain some ground (=nobles), England must bring a maximum of troops at the center of the board & winter when Edward is available.
The next year, the Scots must try to get back what they lost when Edward was in Scotland.
Multiply this sequence by the number of turns and you know basically what will happen during the game.

Hammer of the Scots brings the rebellion of the Braveheart, William Wallace, to life. As the English player, you seek to pacify Scotland by controlling all the important noble lords.

Theme and game fit together really well --- as a matter of fact, I have not seen a better match before it. There is a lot of strategy in this one, and it is incredibly important to not only focus your attention to turning the most suitable noble, but also to set up your pieces for winter. Still, there is quite a bit of randomness in the game. The best units can be decimated by a few bad rolls and your hand of cards can limit the possibilities you have each year. This aspect of the game makes me wonder why you have to play so many rounds (years): More likely than not, the outcome is decided in the final round anyway (especially since the combat system favors the defenders in a battle). Finally, a word of warning: Be sure to download the latest ruleset from Columbia Games, as they will definitely be needed to clarify some issues.

It's all about the Wintering, baby.  A mediocre two-player light wargame.  There's never enough cards to do everything you want, and you have to judge your opponent well.  Bluffing is clever.  However, after a handful of plays, I'm not sure that there's enough meaningful strategy to keep me, as most of the decisions seem to be tactical in nature.  Not only that, but there's a lot of luck in the number of times the English draw Edward.  Too many and they crush the Scots.  Too few, and they can't mount a successful defense.  The rules are surprisingly incomplete.  Did I miss the part that explained that the English levy each year is random?  And the fact that nobody can winter in England also seems to have been omitted.  In both cases I had to check the Geek before I could find any resolution.  Other rules were unclear or not where I expected them to be.  Not the biggest problem in the world, but one that could and should have been rectified by the time the second edition came around.

You can play it in a relatively short amount of time and it plays different each time. 12 plays so far and I still have only played the Braveheart setup.

@ Good re-playability
@ Allows you to play Wallace, A3

Generally CG games is so suitable to play with the casual gaming buddies. I know few people that would sit through and hour-long rules briefing let alone pick up a heavier rulebook and learn by themselves. But many of the CG titles like this one, can be taught and set up in 10-15 minutes.

Easy to learn hard to master block wargame. Great stuff. Also, this is a wonderful "gateway" wargame to introduce new players to this side of the hobby.

Intial rating only:  I like this game quite a bit, but I think I prefer Wizard Kings due to the replayability factor.

Updated rating - Leaving this at a 7 for now.  I find the game is VERY luck dependent.  I have played twice, and both times was plagued by terrible dice rolling and bad card draws.  I do enjoy playing the game, but wish there was a way to make the game a little less focused on the roll of the dice.

HoS has become my favorite war game.  It has simple rules, deep strategy and can be completed in a short period of time.  My 11 year old and I play it a lot.  We were looking for a 2 player game and this is it.  It really lives up to the hype.  Excellent game.

When we play HotS we really get transported to Scotland hundreds of years ago. The game got me interested in Scottish history, which tells me thematically the game is doing it right. The fog of war effect of the blocks is very exciting as well, and apart from a few fiddly rules around reinforcements the game is easy to teach.

RATING: 8
I like historically based games, so this definitely works for me. Lots of fun, but if you play as the Scots, it seems much more difficult to win -- I'd recommend having the person less familiar with strategy or games in general take the side of the English.

020803_after my first game, i'll give it an initial 7.5...i believe it probably deserves a higher rating & ive got another game of it booked today(0408), but i'll stand by this for now. 0408 second play and i played braveheart scenario as the scots again. got hammered again. wallace got cornered round 1 and brutally murdered and was all over in the 4th year! by eng controlling all the nobles! argh! i'll admit i also had appalling dice rolls!
several more games on (up to number 7 now)
24/04/04 taught hammer to yet another player, i think it does have to drop down a notch as gameplay is limited as the scenarios are set up and that dictates often what you should be trying to achieve early on.

Ok, I'm sold.  This is a great game, and not even all that complicated.  My interest in block games is solidly increasing at this point.

The following are what make Hammer of the Scots unique, as well as a cherished milestone in wargaming:

The first use of card-based group activations, and the continued implementation and refinement of the A/B/C combat initiative system (first pioneered in Wizard Kings).

Asymmetric sides (Scots, English) that play very differently and have their own side-specific mechanics.

Nobles that switch sides when they are defeated in battle, rather than being eliminated (noble-capturing strategy #1).

A board that resets in the winter phase of every game year, during which time nobles switch sides if their home areas are enemy occupied (noble-capturing strategy #2).

The inclusion of Wallace and Norse blocks, both of which continually threaten to overthrow the medieval English way of life.

Finally, like many other block games (Richard III and Napoleon, for instance), HoTS bases its win conditions on what wargamers do best: killing or capturing your opponent's dudes.  This is in contrast to other games (e.g., Crusader Rex, Texas Glory, Julius Caesar) that focus on conquering and holding VP cities, which are fun in their own right but don't have the same gut-pounding, free-flowing dynamics as Hammer.

I often find strategic wargames that lack a political component a bit thin, but my first game of 'Hammer' was very fun.  Look forward to many more.  As a plus, my wife kicked my ass in our first game.

Good, clear, rules, and nice components. Needs markers of some sort to clarify how many units have crossed borders - I used little 5mm dice!

Short rules, but it requires several plays to start getting proficient in it. I like it but I am waiting to play more to see if this moves up to an 8 or 9.

I've only played a practice solitaire game so far and I really like it.  I need to make sure I understand the wintering rules.  Fabulous game and I already have my brother sold that we'll play it sometime.  We also have a friend who would likely be interested as well due to the theme.  After a couple of face to face plays we might start playing it online against each other after that.

This is a game into which it is fairly easy to get. The rules are clear and quickly read, and then the first few game turns help to put things in motion. The system is easy enough to be played with non-hardcore players.
I like how one must reset his strategy at every game turn, and depending on the results of the previous turn, the whole balance of power can be changed.
I now need to play a lot more and see how balanced the whole thing is.

Great use of the block system. Lots of compelling decisions and quick pace to the game. Luck can be a big factor, but good planning should still win out. Plus the game plays quickly enough and keeps you engaged that even a game lost due to bad luck can be enjoyable, and keep you wanting to play again.

Tentative rating after 1 play. This is my first block game, and it's great fun! The teeter tottering nature of the nobles' loyalties add to the 'whazgunahapen' factor.

After 1 Play: I'm finding it a bit hard to remember this one, as I played it quite a while ago.  What I do remember is generally positive, but not good enough to get over what I'd call the wargame wall - that is, good enough to justify the number of plays it would take to really internalize the rules and start delving into strategy.

RATING: 7.5
I do prefer CruRex slightly over this due to a more exciting situation. Every turn tends to be the same. Brits mass hoard, walk north, scamper about and return without much being done. Wheras the lonely hero runs around the countryside "persuading" nobles to do the right thing.

Definitely the game that the cookie cutter Columbia block cycle was made for (it's no coincidence that it's the first in this series). Much better than the others I've played: Crusader Rex, Julius Caesar, and Richard III. There are still a few rules clarifications that I can't find answers to, but overall a very nice, snappy design.

RATING: 4
04/20/06:  Rating 4 (after 4 or so plays):  I originally got Hammer of the Scots when it first game out.  I played it a couple of times and thought it was increadibly boring, so I sold it.  Years past, and I continued to hear nothing but good things about it.  Then Crusader Rex came out, which is a very solid and enjoyable game, so once the HotS 2nd ed came out, I bought another one.  Well, I thought it was just as boring the second time.  I think the two main things I don't like about HotS are the wintering rules for the English and the combat units=victory conditions thing.  In my experience, the wintering rules cause the game to stagnate all of a sudden and more or less reset, and this creates a bottleneck area right around the middle of the board.  That fact, combined with the mobile victory points both draw out a game which seems to want to be a lot quicker, and therefore feel arbitrary (and frustrating).  I'm by no means a HotS expert, but after 4 tries of a game, I think I'm 100% ready to give up on it.  Crusader Rex does everything right that HotS doesn't, by the way, so if you're wondering which to get, I must recommend it over HotS (along with any number of other games).

A bad attempt to imitate german games using block system. I played only three games but it still seems very unbalanced.

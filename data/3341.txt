I enjoyed playing it, but it is not a game I will ever suggest and I will have to be seriously coerced to play it. Kind of slow and not a lot of strategy.

RATING: 7
I think it's a fun game. A semi-quick card game with multiple rounds and some "Take That" factor. Also, my career is in computers, so I can't help but appreciate the theme.

Of course I love this game because I know too well the pains of working in Silicon Valley. The mechanics work well once you get the hang of what's good & what's bad. This usually comes faster if you've lived here.

i loved the idea.  the rules weren't hot, though, and there doesn't seem to be an actual game to play here.  i would play it again if somebody else that liked it and knew it well was teaching, just to confirm.

(Oh boy, can I ever relate to the theme of this game.) My gaming group feels it is an advanced Mille Bornes but I think Burn Rate is much more satisfying. In the way that some actions unfold, it mimics what happens in a real company. Neat game!

Well the people in the office dig it.  The game can be played over lunch too.  Though there seems to be a lot of times when you just have to discard and start a new.  Be careful though, no brain employees and contractors will cost you the game.

A fun little game.  Works well with two (with a bit of a runaway leader issue) and makes us smile.  I like the way the game play is a race to the bottom.

The card stock is fine.  The artwork is a bit spartan, but the symbols and card layout are clear.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An amusing, "take-that" style game.  Played 2-er with the "discarding = playing" variant.  Deck distribution seems imbalanced (too many level 2&3 release cards, not enough poach cards).  THINGS TO KNOW: most attack cards will be yellow or blue (so focus on skilled managers in those colors), the worst ideas are usually level 0 (so try to avoid having an unstaffed or easily poached Sales Dept)

A fun game, similar to Chez Geek in that there's not much strategy but the humor in the cards makes up for it.  It takes all of five minutes to understand the mechanics and general strategy of the game.

RATING: 7
People who have read my comments &amp; gotten a sense for my taste in games will probably be shocked to see me rate this game comparatively highly. Heck, first time out of the box I&#039;d even give it an 8. The theme is really well done, and on top of that you have real strategic decisions to make that affect the game. Not huge ones, admittedly, but decisions nontheless. Are people who haven&#039;t lived through the whole dot-com thing going to enjoy it? That&#039;s an open question for me, and I expect not. But for anyone who survived the Silicon Valley boom and bust, this is one you should pick up for fun.

We thought the idea might be a little odd, but after a few plays we really enjoyed the game. The only problem is identifying whose skill number is needed to match the game, yours or the other players. Two players game are wicked and nasty.

This is a very light party game that is very nasty towards your opponents. Luck do play quite major here, as you expect on party games. Overall a nice "take that" game.

RATING: 4
The cards are funny; the game play is OK.  It's all about targetting opponents while avoiding being targetted.  Once you get past the jokes on the card, it's all about the frustration of constantly losing money and getting trashed by your opponents.

Most games that are funny and timely aren&#039;t that fun to play; Burn Rate is an exception. There is a solid game hiding under the Dot.Com jokes, and one that is fun to play even when the jokes wear thin.  On the other hand, the jokes are so darn funny it will take awhile for them to wear thin :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice little game about "back in the days". We used to play it a lot, until one of my friends had a real-life "Bad Idea" of his own and poured in a ton of money.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Captures the dot.com theme pretty well. Hire too many employees, particularly Vice Presidents, and your salary payout or "burn rate" is so high that your company plummets to its death. If you have too many bad ideas, then you must hire Engineers. If you don't hire enough Engineers, then you must hire loads of Contractors for more money. If you have too many Contractors, then you have to start firing your regular employees jsut to reduce your burn rate. Very clever.

There are some graphic design and rules issues that make the first game a bit confusing, particularly since the strategy is somewhat non-standard, but it is definitely worth the trouble.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is the rare humor-based game that rewards some thought. You'll be furrowing your brow as you read through and try to implement the instructions, but stick with it. Any game with a rulebook that includes the statement, "Put your engineers in an unruly mob below your managers," can't be all bad.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The theme of this game is amusing, but the game play lacks.  It is overly complicated for the depth that it delivers.  My rating of three is just for the game play.  If you are a big fan of the humor, you might enjoy the game more.

(2-4) Four startup companies compete to go bankrupt last by keeping salaries down and foisting bad projects on your opponents.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
An amusing game, good for a few laughs if you're acquainted with the dot-com environment.  If not, probably would rate half a point lower, for a 5.5 rating.  Simply and accurately simulates many of the challenges of the dot-com startup business:  difficulty hiring competent employees, difficulty firing incompetent employees; expensive contractors; doomed business concepts such as online pet store or hand-held URL scanners.  $25 million a month is not an inconceivable Burn Rate in this funny little card game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
If you like being a 'business man' and make the life of your co-players more difficult, then you will enjoy this!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is primarily a sarcastic commentary on the dot-com bubble.  Ideas are played on opponents to make them waste money.  You release projects not to make money, but so you can stop wasting money on them---your only cash inflow comes from venture capital infusions.  You win by being the last player standing when everyone else has gone bankrupt.  I enjoy the humor and find the game of some interest, though some people don't care for it.

I've only played this once so far.  It's certainly not my type of game, featuring lots of random cards and arbitrary attacking (and teaming up), but the game actually mitigated the double-teaming, at least with the players in my game.  It also has some slightly cumbersome scorekeeping, but my experience wasn't nearly as bad as I might have expected out of what seems to be a highly luck-driven game.

卡牌互搞遊戲
內容頗貼切
不過機制略少
應該很快就無聊了
運氣也略高
規則;
遊戲目的：
燒光對手的錢，強迫他們雇用多餘的員工或是糟糕的計畫
撐到最後還沒倒閉的玩家獲勝！
遊戲起始設定：
★外包人員放在一旁
★把員工依照部門分類，洗勻後面朝下放在桌子中央並將最上面一張翻開，這是人力銀行
★將功能卡洗牌後放在桌子中央，由發牌者左邊的玩家開始輪流從人力銀行雇用員工
◆輪四回，每人雇用了4名員工，員工不一定要每個部門都有，也可以有一兩個部門缺工，但一定要顧滿4人
★準備紙筆做為銀行記錄每個人的公司經營狀況，初始金額為100元
★一人發6張功能牌讓公司開張吧！
卡片介紹：
★人力卡
◆一般人力：有技能等級，可被網羅走，每回合領薪水
◆副總：
▼如果你的某個部門有副總，即使有其他員工技能等級比他高，他也是部門主管！
▼你的每個部門最多只能有一個副總，你不能在聘多餘一個副總，對手也不能強迫你聘僱
▼副總對公司忠誠度較高，要開除或網羅必須出兩張功能牌！
◆部門主管：每個部門最高技能等級的人成為部門主管，可以把其他人壓在他的下面只露出薪水（其他就是來吃閒飯的人！）
◆工程師：執行爛點子的必要人力，ｘ２的爛點子必須有兩個工程師，以此類推
◆外包人員：
▼如果你的爛點子太多工程師又不夠，你必須要聘用較貴的外包人員
▼當你的工程師足夠時可以把外包人員移除
▼你不能用解僱卡解僱他們，你只能解放爛點子或是加入新的工程師
▼如果外包人員不夠了也可以自製一些代替品，就像現實總有用不完的外包人員一樣
★功能卡
◆攻擊性：紅色數字，數字大小要跟對方該卡牌顏色的員工一樣才能出
◇範例：你有０、１的爛點子牌，但是你的對手有技能等級２的業務部部門主管，所以不能對他攻擊
◇範例：你有０、１、２、３的爛點子牌，所以即使你的對手缺工（０）也可以攻擊對方
◆防禦性：黑色數字，數字大小要跟自己該卡牌顏色的部門員工一樣才能出
◇範例：你有１、２、３的解放牌，但是你自己的研發部缺工（０），所以不能用
◇範例：你有３的聘僱卡，當你剛好有技能等級三的人力資源部副總時就可以用
玩法介紹：
★每回合玩家必須按照以下四個步驟進行回合：
1.出牌或棄牌（最多四張）
2.增加或移除外包人員
3.支付薪水
4.補牌到六張
★出牌或棄牌
◆你最多可以使用或丟棄四張手牌
◆出牌規則參照上面牌卡介紹，不管是攻擊或防禦都要參照部門主管的技能等級
◆好的部門主管可以讓你能使用的防禦卡增加，並增加對手攻擊你的難度
◇提示：不要怕棄牌，你應該讓你的手牌快速更新，使用大量的牌以保持領先！  
★增加或移除外包人員
◆當你的工程師數量沒辦法應付爛點子時，你就要增加缺少數量的外包人員
◇例如：你有爛點子ｘ３、爛點子ｘ１，但是你只有兩個工程師，你就要僱用兩個外包人員
◆當你的工程師數量增加，或解放掉一個爛點子，你就可以移除掉外包人員
◇例如：你有爛點子ｘ２、爛點子ｘ１、一個工程師、兩個外包人員，你把爛點子ｘ２解放掉就能移除兩個外包人員
★支付薪水
◆不論你選擇出牌或棄牌，當以上兩個步驟做完時你就必須支付薪水
◆將你所有員工和外包人員的薪水加總，將這個金額從你的銀行扣除
◆如果你的銀行餘額低於零，你的公司就宣告倒閉
◆公司倒閉時你退出遊戲，並把所有功能卡和員工卡分別放到棄牌堆和各部門牌庫底
★補牌到六張
◆將你的手牌補回六張
◆牌庫不足時將棄牌堆重新洗牌
◆換你左手邊的玩家開始他的回合

Funny take that card game that has enough strategic decisions to make you feel like you aren't wasting your time.  I can't see playing this all the time, but it works as a decent enough closer.  The thought that this is a hand management game is absurd.  You more or less want to use the cards you can and maybe keep something as back up, but really it comes down to the fact that some cards are better than others, and if you draw those, you are fine, if you don't you lose.  The decisions you make control just how badly you lose, and that is the fun of the game.

One of those rare games for me where the humor works well enough that it at least partially compnsates for just decent gameplay at best.  The game itself is hugely luck-based, largely dependent on the luck of the draw.  However, there is some hand management as far as strategy goes.  A good one to play once in a while.

Single play. You don't appreciate the handicaps posed by deficient staff until you're stuck with them, and its so hard to replace them that it can really wreck your game. While this might make for a great simulation, its not a fun idea to have a big learning curve in a filler card game.

I'd play it again, but a few basic strategy issues need pointing out to newbies before the game.

It was sort of fun when I played it beacause of the theme and the interaction.  There is just not much strategy to this game or control.

I worked for a startup (that never made it) during the dot-com boom, and my co-workers and I played this game regularly.  We even made custom cards mocking some of the other employees in the company.  Sadly, those days are over, so I don't get to play this game any more, but it really was a lot of fun.

Not a game that it takes skill to win or keep from losing first. Most of the time I didn't have the card I needed so I discarded some cards to try to get it. Either I never got it or I ended up discarding something I could have used to get it.

Played once with four players.  Much too easy to get completely shut down by attack cards while you hope to draw the right cards to actually be able to do something.

The game is reasonably good but the theme is just too personal.  Having been through plenty of dot-bombs myself, I don't want to rehash this in my spare time.

This game may be a bit of a headscratcher for anyone who didn't witness the dot com bust, but for those who did, Burn Rate is a light and humorous dose of fun with plenty of references to those failed products of yesteryear. Play this one with a group who doesn't mind smacking each other with nasty cards, as that's the way to victory here.

Fun little game.  The theme of running a struggling dot.com venture is pretty solid and shines through in the gameplay.

I just don't care much for this kind of card game. Dull and lifeless, seems to have been invented just on jokiness to theme only.

I love this one. Has some unique play mechanisms. There are a few viable paths to victory here, giving it good replay value. Plays fast, which I like.

Not a terrible game, but not one I am dying to play either.  The killer is the time it takes to play.  Its just too long for what it is.

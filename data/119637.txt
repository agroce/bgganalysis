TtR Deutschland is almost the same version as Märklin. The primary difference is the lack of the passenger mechanic, which makes this version easier to understand and play. Some of the tickets have also been changed, but basically the maps are identical. It’s a nice map, but to be honest I would rather play Märklin or many of the other TtR maps. It’s not a bad map, not at all, but it doesn’t add anything new – and if an expansion is going to stay in my collection, it has to… I would play it again, no doubt about it, but it’s not an awesome expansion.

The map is almost divided into two; there are the color-coordinated, long routes in the East and the grey, short routes in the western part of the map. This works nicely in Märklin because of the passengers, but I don’t think it’s extremely well balanced in this map. I know the ticket distribution is also skewed in order to balance it, so I’m not saying it’s imbalanced. 

The best thing about this edition is that you can draw tickets from two different stacks; one of the stack features shorter routes and the other some longer routes, so it’s easier to control what kind of tickets you get. At least in theory… Because it doesn’t really work when most of the tickets are between 8-13 points anyway…

Ticket to Ride: Marklin without all the awful passenger stuff :)


Back to basics for this nice addition to the ticket to ride family. No stations, no ferries, no tunnels, no complications. :)

This was the BEST TTR experience I've had in a long time.
The passengers TOTALLY changes the game WAY MORE than you would think.
Almost ALL other TTR versions gives an incentive to hoard cards before playing them. But this. . If you play quick and dirty small routes you get a lot of passengers which can be HUGE. I, in this first game, went for that with just a little passion and i ended up netting 80 POINTS on passengers alone!
Now, this is my first time playing and of course this will also go stale in a while. . but boy did this blew the hole TTR-group-think I knew apart wide open!

Initial rating = 8 (for what it is in all its TTR-lightness)

Great addition to Ticket to Ride.
I love the art in the train cards.
The map is good, the long single routes are quite intimidating. 
I want to try with the 1902 expansion to add more flavour to the map.
I would like to play it if have the opportunity.

Like all TtRs, this is nice to play.  There is, however, a strategical issue, which will soon make me claim the game is broken/solved...

Rating with the expansion 1902. The brilliant thing with the expansion is, that it really gives a reason for build early, instead of hording cards. Pennsylvania map has similar thing, but here it is more pronounced. It is really a easy streamlined change that totally gives the game a whole new dimension. Thumbs up!

RATING: 8
My rating is based on playing it with the 1902 expansion. Collecting the passengers enables you to score a lot of extra points at the end of the game and make you complete routes that you would overlook if they were not there.

RATING: 8.5
Great version of the classic TTR. Plays with the same general ruleset as the original(no tunnels, ferries, or "strange" mechanics). It uses the german map(same map as Marklin), but has two separate ticket piles to draw from. One set is long tickets, one is short. You can draw from either/both when you draw. 

In short, this plays cleanly like the USA map, but with more variety/balance. Also, the German map is great.

This is a really excellent version of Ticket to Ride. It's simple; there are no tunnels, stations, ferries, etc. The only complication this adds over the USA map is that there are two decks of tickets; short tickets (2-12 points) and long tickets (13+ points). This requires no additional understanding to play, while adding a good amount of extra strategy.

The board layout is identical to that in Marklin, however, the artwork has been completely redone to reflect the style of the other editions. This artwork extends to the train cards, which have as-yet-unseen artwork. There are a couple of extra tickets to balance the game given that this version does not include the complex passengers that were in the Marklin edition.

rating after 2 plays, great map, with lots of grey tracks and interesting twist with tickets being divided to long and short track piles.

RATING: 9.5
On its own bit unnecessary addition to TTR family. Improves board graphics but removes the unique aspect of Märklin (passengers). Only country connections remain to differentiate from US TTR. With expansion, however, it gains new life and becomes worthy addition to the family. The passenger mechanic is so much better than Märklin one! Without expansion I only recommend this if you really want German map instead of US one.

Nice map - rules are quite similar to regular TTR, apart from the countries (like in TTR Switzerland) and the difference between taking long and short tracks. The western part of Germany contains a lot of short grey tracks, the eastern contains a lot of long colored tracked including some 7 wagon tracks which give you 18 points each if you are able to fullfill. With 5 the map becomes quite crowded. City names can be difficult to read with the medieval font. I'm also not sure if the bonus for the amount of fulfilled tickets is as good as the longest track bonus in other versions.

Base game is nothing special and no different than TTR just a different map.  The 1902 expansion makes this game.  Adding the meeple collecting adds a mechanism twist that we haven't seen in a TTR map.  Base game is a 6, but add in the expansion and this is an easy 8.

Very easy streamlined introduction level game, although an experienced player will nearly always win against a newbie. Quite abstract and since you're just building for points and not to improve some feat for a future turn for some it might feel a bit passionless.

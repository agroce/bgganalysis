I won, coming from the back!
The game has a mechanism against run-away leaders, for some actions you need to share your gain with someone (where you typically chose the player with the lowest score). They all settled on the idea that I'm in last, even after I wasn't anymore, so I managed to sneak by and win.

I really like the theme. Thats probably why I ended up picking this game. Great artwork on the map and cards and solid empire building, exploring traits. Of course this game might have needed some more development to even increase the fun, but you are still able to house-rule. The game sometimes suffers from a strong king-making effect towards the end which isnt necessarily a bad thing in this case.

A base of Shogun (Wallenstein), a slice of Puerto Rico,an aroma of Struggle of Empires. 
Need to be played in good company. The end of game is fantastic. Enjoy!

Great design, great ideas, outstanding board. The game gets even better at the second time, when you can really use different strategy and finding the real depth of this game, when you understand that there's not just a scientist and an explorer in your deck and war can be a used as a winning option (and a sweet revenge) It's not necessary to play at 6 players, less is quicker but still very enjoyable.

I found this game dribbled along slowly and rather laboriously. The theme is good, but unfortunately the game play not so good. Slow and limiting with far too many wasted actions based on bad dice rolls (which could screw your turn up totally) or the cards not being appropriate and having no gain. Not the worst of games but not one I would choose to play again.

Έπαιξα το [thing=99392][/thing].
Δεν το τελειώσαμε αλλά πήραμε μια γεύση.
Εν συντομία το παιχνίδι προσπαθεί να κάνει πολλά πράγματα ταυτόχρονα και δεν τα καταφέρνει τόσο καλά. Το πρόβλημα του είναι ότι έχει πολύ καλες ιδέες μέσα, αλλά δεν είναι σωστά συνδυασμένοι οι κανόνες. Γενικά παρατήρησα ότι υπάρχει αρκετή τυχαιότητα ιδίως στην αρχή σε παιχνίδι που ο πλούσιος γίνεται πλουσιότερος. Υπάρχει περίπτωση να πέσει παίκτης σε αρνητικό feedback loop παίρνωντας δάνειο και αποτυγχάνοντας κανα δυό explore  (ακόμα και με explore +2 το είδαμε και αυτό... ) και δεν θα φταίει σε τίποτα. Αυτό κατά την άποψη μου είναι κακό. 

Καλά για τους κανόνες και το χάος με τις εκδόσεις δεν θα το σχολιάσω γιατί το έχουν αναφέρει και άλλοι παλιότερα.

Επιπλέον δεν μου άρεσε ότι το άνοιγμα είναι σχεδόν το ίδιο για ολους και από τις 6 κάρτες χρησιμοποιούνται οι 5 που οδηγεί σε παρόμοιο παίξιμο.

Δεν μου άρεσε επίσης το πως γίνεται το revolt. Έτυχε στην παρτίδα να φάμε την πόλη κάποιου επειδή δύο παίκτες παίξαμε σερί rebel. Καλύτερα θα ήταν να είναι μια phase και όχι να γίνεται trigger κάθε φορά που παίζει ένας παίκτης το rebel. Αν μή τι άλλο οδηγεί σε kingmaking. 

Το παιχνίδι έχει και καλά στοιχεία. Μου άρεσε πχ ο σχεδιασμός του board και η ιδέα ότι τα tokens του treasury μπορεί να γίνουν οτιδήποτε (άποικοι, εμπορικά πλοία, πολεμικά πλοία, εμπορικά αγαθά κτλ).
Μου άρεσε επίσης ότι συμπεριλαμβάνει και τα αρνητικά στοιχεία της αποκιοκρατίας όπως το όπιο στην Κίνα και οι σκλάβοι στην Αφρική.

Επίσης μου άρεσε και η συμπερίληψη οικονομικών και πολεμικών στοιχείων και της πειρατείας με έξυπνο τρόπο.

Γενικά θα το ξανάπαιζα αλλά δεν είναι κάποια WOW εμπειρία. 
Θα του βάλω ένα 6άρι δλδ ΟΚ game some fun or challenge at least, will play sporadically if in the right mood. Μπορεί να ανέβει στο 7 αλλά δύσκολα παραπάνω.

While I knew this wasn't the kind of lighter, fun game I like when I bought it, the rules didn't seem too complex and the gameplay looked fairly streamlined, so I took a chance. In actual practice, however, the game dragged and took much too long to play. The buildup to a decent economic engine seemed tedious and difficult-- let alone paying off a loan. Wars seemed too frequent, and losing one was often devastating. 

If this had been designed as a simpler game, it could have been great, IMHO. Still, it's quite an accomplishment, and creating something this complex is something I don't have the ability to do, so kudos to the designer. I especially like the programmed action cards with two possible actions, so you can change your mind if other players' actions dictate it. (I ordinarily despise games with programmed actions.) With the right audience, it will earn high marks, and deservedly so.

Colonial is a game dripping with theme. The map is a wonderful piece of artwork and the first source of theme, but the rules also provide for an excellent mix of historical experience (especially if playing with the nations variant) and functional resource management game.
I especially like the use of a single form of currency (player tokens), whose meaning change with their position on players' mats (money, merchants fleets, navy) or central board.

The central mechanic is a simultaneous role selection (à la Race for the Galaxy, mixed with Roborally): each player selects 5 cards and simultaneously reveal the first (then each player performs one of the two actions printed on the card), then the second, and so on. That's a great choice from the designer: downtime is minimum, and there's room for diplomacy, bluff and double-thinking.

The game has also some flaws: some infrastructure development routes (logistics, exploration) seem more useful than others (economics, and especially navy), some parts could've easily been cut (privateers, while fluffy, seem not overtly interesting), and there's some dice rolls (exploration more than wars) that seem quite swingy.

Anyway, Colonial is a rather interesting game, quite unique and very enjoyable.

Tentative rating is 7.5.

RATING: 7
More thematic than Struggle of Empires but also much more expensive. After two plays Struggle is the better game, but I have yet to try the revised rules for the game.

Update: It seems to me that the game has too many easy ways of scoring prestige and not enough competition. Increasing the winning score to 12 might do it. I'm going to try the Nation's variant. I've played the regular game with 5 and 6 players only and usually at game end several players are close to winning at the same time. Instead of seeing this as a tight game I see it one where it is difficult to be really behind. Exploration and colony building score so many points that fighting other players is usually inefficient.

Further Update: After several more plays with the Nations variant I've determined that the game is good but with experienced players seem to end in a late game military race and wars to stop/win the last prestige point. I actually think the base game is probably the better experience because it removes restrictions that slow the game down with the Nation's variant.

I have mixed feelings about this game. The ever changing "living rules" along with the first edition war rules just led to obfuscation. Just look at the amount of rules questions on the geek! It seemed like homework trying to figure out which rules were the most recent ones. 

Despite this, once you learn the game, it is a pleasure to play. The board is gorgeous and the theme impeccable. It is a gamer's game that offers negotiation, conflict, interesting decisions on where to colonize, mixed with the dilemma of which of the two characters to pick from the one card to pursue your plans. All this and fun too!

I have not played with the second edition rules yet, but having read and printed them, they seem to balance out any imperfections of the first edition and seem to streamline the game. Upping your Economy and Navy seem to be more significant with the second edition rules. I'm looking forward to getting this one on the table again!

On the whole, a great game.  However, when the dice defy probability, I feel like I am playing Risk.  I've only played three times, and I rated this a nine up until today when it dropped to an eight.  I think the asymmetric nation powers are a must for a 2-player game.  We tried it once without, and was not nearly as exciting.

RATING: 6
Rather dry and process-driven world domination game. Probably more fun for Eurogamers than AT-type gamers. My biggest beef with the game is the board. The various continents should have been color-coded or made to stand out in some way. The various progress tracks have labels that are ridiculously small—in addition to being hidden in the baroque artwork.

The "character" actions are actually quite ingenious. Typically, you'll want to do both of the actions that are listed on one card—but one of them is all you will get that turn. Programming 4 cards and saving one of the two remaining for a final action is also very nice. I like that you have to commit to doing "something", rather than just waiting to screw someone with every action you have.

The colony markers and tokens are uninspired, but I imagine devotees will pimp them out. Overall, a good game. Probably best with 5 or 6.

2011. 2-6p. 120 min. A victory point race game involving area control and economics.  It relies heavily on players keeping one another in check, and it tends to devolve into coordinated leader-bashing (which can repeat multiple times as new leaders emerge).  I really don't care for these types of games.

Juego de selección de roles ambientado en la época colonial. Admite de dos a seis jugadores. Y bueno, está bastante entretenido, aunque es un poco incómodo de explicar, porque cada jugador tiene nada menos que doce roles para escoger, de los cuales, en cada ronda, jugará cinco. El objetivo es ser el primero en conseguir 10 puntos de prestigio.
Una vez que sabes jugar, creo que es bastante estratégico y tiene bastante interacción. Es recomendable, pero solo para jugones. Manténgase fuera del alcance de no aficionados. Por cierto, es un KS y por lo visto, cuando salió las reglas fueron objeto de muchas polémicas y revisiones, pero actualmente es perfectamente jugable e incluso interesante.

A great 5 or 6 player game and enjoyable at 4 players.  in some ways it feels more thematic than Glenn Drover's Empires and certainly more than Endeavor.  the mechanics and gameplay feel smooth once you learn the exceptions.  Unfortunately the luck aspect will irritate some gamers and the game really needs at least 5 players to bring out the fierce competition and potential for warfare.  The beginning is a bit scripted, but as the game plays out interaction develops with great potential for conflict and deal-making.  The nations variant adds greater theme and historical realism if players wish to add complexity.

Well here was a game I was not looking forward to and thought I would be nice enough to play... LOOK AT THE BOARD, it's GORGEOUS!!! And then you play the game... and it is brilliant. I could have had this game go another 30-40 minutes and I would have still have been loving it. With more players there would have been more fighting for sure. Plenty of decisions, and with the right players not too much AP. Choose the order of your roles, but if someone messes with you you could use the alternate role on a given turn... NICE! Suhweetness. Someone came up and flipped out we were playing this game, as he was waiting for his Kickstarter copy to arrive. We had borrowed a special copy from a friend. I felt suitably superior until I remembered I was being forced to play this game, and that I should be ashamed of my great luck.

Kickstarted (2012) -- great quality but I will never, ever, KS with CoffeeHaus again.  They were terrible.

Another play in, and still like it, but seems like there are paths you have to follow to succeed (exploration).  One minor quibble. If you roll badly, you will do badly in the end. I wish they had some mechanism to reduce the sting of just rolling terribly (even with the powers that help with rolling).
One play, with an asterix (played colonies so very wrong).  So far, it seems to be a good game (a bit harsh in places with player conflict), and the economy is brutal.

Very interesting first play though.

Nice map, interesting action selection mechanics. More clever than most eurogames by far. Reminded me a bit of [i]Struggle of Empires[/i], actually. Unfortunately, it has a distinctly underdeveloped feeling and there appear to have been several rules changes already since its release. Note that I haven't played the 2nd edition, so it may have fixed some of these issues.

The fixed VP as a victory condition combined with the combat rules potentially leads to a nasty bash the leader problem. And, for the most part, the privateer and rebellion actions are completely ignored until someone is hovering around 9 VP. You can compete for areas, but it mostly feels like multi-player solitaire.

Still, I give the designer credit for coming up with something more interesting than the usual eurogarbage that's coming out these days.

So close. Great action selection mechanism.

Suffers from a broken ending where players cannot break through to victory point target because table works against their doing so. Also, rules changed so many times that I lost track and do not know what is current.

Colonial intoxicated me from the moment I first read its rulebook, providing the promise a game of colonization and exploration that more effectively included all of the essential elements than any of the other options currently on the market. It meets that promise fairly effectively too, with plenty of potential for alternative strategies based on exploration, conquest, colonization and development. The early experience of playing Colonial was such that I suspected that it might end up being my top game of 2011. That did not end up being the case for two reasons: 1) 2011 had not yet finished showing me all of the great games it had to offer and 2) the continuing fluctuation of the rules. I still like it and am glad I got it, but 2011 was a great year for games, and a few others have eclipsed Colonial.

RATING: 8
Players represent one of the six traditional colonial powers, exploring and exploiting the globe during the age of exploration.  

Players program their turns in advance, by laying out action cards, each depicting two possible actions.  Cards are flipped and one of the actions chosen.  There are twelve actions available, but only five will take place on any turn.  The actions juggle various resources, such as money, merchants, the navy, as well as colonial assets in areas that have been successfully explored.  As the game develops, resources will begin being produced and shipped back to Europe for profit, accelerating the game and opening the world up further.
The winner of the game is the first to ten victory points.   Fun game, looks glorious, plays very cleanly - almost too elegant, and possibly too dry for some.  Still, this is a very nice game design, and a classy work of art compared to Archipelago.  Nice stuff.

An interesting game of colonial expansion. It has many aspects of a good euro: deciding which action and in which order whilst working out your opponents likely move.  But then it adds something different in Risk-like dice-fest warring interaction.  Overall it doesn't have the elegance and intuitive game-play of a top euro; and the luck of the dice, particularly when exploring a territory, can be frustrating.  I would play again though, and my rating could move up with more plays.  But for now it is good but not great.

This is a euro game, but its totally king of the hill and thus ends up being rather similar in some ways to A Game of Thrones. In both games the best strategy is to get within striking distance of victory then sit and build to a position from where you can claim 3 or 4 vps in quick succession and sneak a win. I like the game, but don't really like the king of the hill sneak a win. I makes the game ending and winning rather unsatisfying.

A játék gyönyörű. A tábla, a kártyát, minden.
A játék maga?
Nos ez érdekes kérdés: sok összetevős.
A szabály magyarázat 1 óra volt, és nehezen állt össze a kép. Másodjára már jobban menne: így játék után világos minden :-).
A játék -szerintem legalábbis- jól modellezi a felfedezések korát. Jól van kitalálva, jó ötletek benne. Pl. h 1 féle jelző van, ami mindent jelöl: árut, kincset, helyfoglalást, hajót, haditengerészetet: annak függvényében h épp hol van. Nyilván ebben is az egymásba átalakulás -árból érték, kincsből hajók, felfedező hajók letelepednek, stb...jól kitalált körforgás.
A felfedezések ugyan kockával, érték megdobása: de a megfelelő pluszok beszerzésével, itt kevés szerepe a szerencsének a kockadobálás ellenére is. Ugyanakkor a harcokban, meg lázadásnál, felkelésnél jobban kijön a szerencse szerepe, hisz úgy általában egy kockával 1:3-hoz a jó dobás esélye, és hát a játék folyamán volt aki úgy kb 14-15 kocka dobásból 1 v 2 sikert dobott :-), 
/A 14-15 kocka dobás az nem ennyi alkalom egy alkalommal 1-5 kockával dob az ember, azt hiszem ez nála olyan 7 alkalom volt/. Tehát itt belelehet futni a szerencse szerepbe.
Ugyanakkor szerintem nem annyira zavaró ez, és belefér.
A játék 8-asa még bőven változhat: mindkét irányba.
Ugyanakkor ár-érték aránya: hát tudja a fene, milan: 59 euro, kicsit sokallom érte.
A játék idő: hát jól elhúztuk: de ennek egyik oka, h azu első 2-3 forduló után állt össze a kép teljesen, h mit-hogy merre. Így azért ez jelentősen csökkenthető. És még plusz lehet, h a gyarmatosításnál mi az egyszerű szabályokat használtuk -ritkán szoktuk a nem fullos játékkal kezdeni, de itt úgy éreztük elég megérteni anélkül is.
Szóval mindenképp lesz még játék vele, és alapvetően tetszik. Jól tervezhető: 6 akció kártya, amin mindegyiken 2 akció lehetőség, vagy-vagy megoldással, ebből 4 letéve, sorrendben, és miután mindenki egyesével és felváltva kijátszotta a 4 lapját, egyesével felfedve, a végén maradék két lapból még mint egy utolsó esélyként, lehet egyet választani, és ezzel az előtte esetlegesen elrontott, mások által "bekevert" részeket helyre lehet hozni.
Na meg jó, h többször is lehet a másik dolgait felhasználni, persze ha az ellenfél is engedélyezi, de mivel általában nagyon jól jár vele, érdemes neki, na persze érdemes a megfelelően "szegényt" kiválasztani, h akarja. :-).
Összességében több pozitívum, mint negatívum, a nyelvfüggő kártyákat meg amúgy is lemagyarítom, szóval rendben van a játék.

I found this to be a quite enjoyable strategy game that mixes economics and war and affords players a lot of options. In the first game I played the emphasis seemed to be on economics, and I found myself trailing most of the other players (5 player game). I was instead focused on accruing prestige points and was poised to win due to being ahead in colonies. I got to go first on the 5th turn and attempted to win by exploring new territory. All I needed was two good rolls out of ten (33% chance on each d6). I rolled ten blanks! The other players then began a concerted methodical attack to reduce my empire. Fortunately, our allotted session time expired so we had to call the game early with me still in the lead!

First off, I have to say that for some reason, I've moved away from empire building games on the table. I prefer them on the PC. I'm not interested in sitting around for hours and hours playing a game of building up my stuff and then tearing down someone else's. Or conversely, having a game distilled down to an uninteresting level (looking at you, Endeavor).

The one of this genre I find the most interesting is Colonial: Europe's Empires Overseas, though I do think the endgame has a bit of a problem. But let's put that to the side for now; the reason I like this game is that it encompasses many facets of geopolitical competition.

Economic = the economy is quite interesting here in that you can ship as many goods as you have merchant ships. So if I have 3 merchant ships I can ship 3 goods, right, except say I only have 1 good from one colony on the board at this time, well I can ship 2 goods from 2 other players. I'll ask that you return the favor later on. And then in the late game, I might refuse to ship any of your goods b/c I'm afraid you're winning and I don't want to help you.

Territory Control =  control of territories changes throughout the game through peaceful means. You can "viceroy" your control discs into a territory in order to take over control of the goods spaces in the region. Once you control that good you can ship it (or let someone else as per above) for money. If you control all the goods spaces in one region, then you can colonize it which offers some super nice bonuses to you.

Monopolies = if you're the only one control a color of good, then it's considered to be your own monopoly which is an economic boon to you. Part of the game is about getting control of goods that break other people's monopolies.

Unrest = you can take actions to foment unrest and then spark a rebellion in other people's territories. It's especially helpful to mess with colonies as once someone colonizes a territory, you can no longer viceroy your discs in there, so you can only mess with it via unrest. The owner can take a missionary action to try and calm things down.

Battle = of course you can still outright attack one another both on land and at sea. Naval battle can get really costly as once you wipe out someone's navy, you can then attack their merchant fleet which they need to ship goods to make money.

Exploration = you can explore and attempt to find new territories; the person who does so gets a VP bonus (it's a race to 10 VP style game). You're always racing to explore things before others, but once you explore something, someone after you in turn order will most likely be able to jump in there and take control before you, so there's that consideration.

Booming City = there's a special bonus called the "booming city" that you can basically purchase for one of your cities that confers a benefit when goods are shipped. Thing is, there's only one on the board so you take it away from one another which adds another element of competition.

There are 4 tech tracks that help you achieve your goals: 1) economy (determines how big your loans are and what size booming city you can purchase), 2) exploration (makes exploration die rolls more effective), 3) navy (to attack and defend), 4) viceroy (to populate explored territories more efficiently with your control discs).

So, it's not just build up and attack with "biggest army wins", in fact, battle in this game is very costly even for the attacker. I like how you use all the other aspects besides warfare to grow your position and attack other people. Games that are just about removing pieces aren't as interesting to me at this point; I want to find other ways to mess with people, and this game does it best. The problem with the endgame is that like any race to X VP games, it can come down to a couple players being close to victory such that "do I attack B and let A win or do I attack A and let B win?"

Note: this comment is based on the v2 rules that improve the game quite a bit; highly recommend if you were one of the early adopters like me.

Three games now.  Important that you play the revised rules.  Another game that can develop into a long climb and yet be decided by success/fail on dice rolls at the end of 4+ hours.  Lots of clever bits on the way but all three games have now ended with 50-75% of the players being able to win in the final turn, and it coming down to who could roll the dice and succeed.  Very satisfying journey during the game but a disappointing end.  Suspect game has hidden depths that need to explored through more plays.

Quite likely the most beautiful world map-board that I've seen (and in my collection, for certain). Although heavily abstracted and pretty dry, everything works well enough, and it all makes sense once you give the system a chance. The tokens convert to treasury, naval forces, and more. I really like how the character cards drive the system. The focus of the game primarily concerns controlling resources around the board, with a small amount of abstracted war between countries. I would have preferred a bit more (and less absracted) warfare thrown in.

I was really interested in finally playing this one but it was a substantial let down. Too euroy, too much disincentive to bother with direct war, not enough negotiation or ability to coop, too much indirect play. Overall I think it is a mediocre game at best and certainly not worth anywhere near the current asking price of around $100.

Played just once. The rules are an atrocious mess and constantly changing. But there appears to be a good core here once all the details get sorted. I dislike the Age of Empires / Struggle of Empires mechanism of "roll one die to see if this exploration succeeds." I don't know why that horrible mechanism keeps getting re-used. It tends to overwhelm player decisions, although it's not as bad here as it is in those aforementioned games.

The exploitative theme also bothers me, to the point where I don't think I would be comfortable having this game on my shelves.

This game is right up my alley.  Area Majority with an economic system layered in.  Role Selection to boot.  

The only problem is that it's a 'race' to 10.  I'd much rather my games have a scoring track and an 'end condition' or set number of turns.  

Also, it seemed similar to other games.  I enjoyed it, just didn't love it.

Complex civilization game with a strange mix of Euro (resource management, role selection) and AT (combat resolved by dice, exploration success determined by dice) mechanics.  A lot going on in this game.  Hard to teach.  Requires more plays to enjoy (seems crucial to take certain actions early in the game).  Many possible strategies, but it seems like it might have issues with runaway leader (he who holds a lot of monopolies and establishes a lot of colonies early will most likely win, while other players struggle to get a resource/merchant engine going).

Played at WifeGonCon 2012.

Really like the components and game play.  Felt  really weird in that there was more than enough victory points on the map for everyone to win.  Felt like could have had another player and you could still play without conflict. 

Ranking based on 1 play, subject to change.  Think it could go up with more conflict/interaction, or could go down if it just a race to explore and colonize 10 points worth.

With too few players, it's a VP race and engaging in conflict takes too much time for its benefit.

With too many players, it doesn't matter what you do in the early game, the end game turns into a conflict-ridden grind between everybody for that last VP.

There are some really innovative ideas here, but I don't think the game was well-enough developed before its release. And while the ruleset continues to evolve, I'm not convinced it's on a trajectory that coincides with my values.

RATING: 5
Played on TOTALLY refurbished (by the designer himself!!) combat rules.  The original ones looked very very bad.  What the hell happened to the playtesting?!

--

It would've been a '6' (read: nothing new, but solid, working design) if not one serious flaw: leader bashing.  The game is extremely prone to this phenomenon.  In fact leader bashing and players-who-do-better-than-others bashing are so extensive that the  scores are very close near the end and who wins is a question of luck/accident.

Add to the above: exploring lands through dice-rolling (a series of bad rolls at the beginning and you are out of the game) and a lot of very _very_ arbitary decisions during the game on whom to help (very directly!) and whom to hit...
  Dice-rolling is employed in other areas too and considering very close scores at the end, it might decide a winner (one lucky roll here (+1VP) or one unlucky roll there (-1VP) is what separates you from being a winner or loser...).

Considering all the above I'm surprised I haven't given a lower rating, but the core of the game is fine, just this dice-rolling and the development of player interaction are serious letdowns...

  Somewhere there deep down lies a gem, but it will not be given us to discover it...

--

More balancing wouldn't hurt too.  Some options/tracks are used rarely/not used at all...

No feeling of being European superpower discovering and exploring the world.  The game is way too dry for its theme.  Almost yet another soulless agression game with economic aspect.

Five-player game.

Nice game system, elegant mechanics, game flows well once players are familiar with the roles. Lots of potential for aggression and negotiation. Quite a bit of luck inherent in the exploration die rolls.

Our first game was very close, but of course, players were self-balancing the game by targeting the perceived leader.

For instance, in the final turn, A and B attacked C to prevent him from winning outright, with the result that E won in his turn instead. The term "kingmaker" was used more than once. :-)

First impression was good: I certainly enjoyed myself. But, it's one of those "conditional" games, where I have to be in the right mood and play with the right opponents to be up for it.

Comments reflect first edition rules; I haven't had the chance to try the revised rules yet.

Colonial is an intriguing game.  I love many aspects of it, but the balance between not enough negotiation and too much negotiation is going to be difficult to thread.  This might render Colonial more enjoyable in theory than in practice.

The programmed actions are a nice touch, and more forgiving than other such systems in that the action cards are double-sided, to minimize the possibility of a wasted action.

I don't have a particular problem with the randomness as the game builds in ways to help the trailing player, so it isn't really much of a disadvantage to miss the first exploration roll.  Later in the game it's about taking calculated risks which I am also fine with.

There were obvious kingmaking opportunities in the game I played and I will have to play a couple more times before I am sure that's just an aberration.  My hope is that this game avoids the Munchkin/Sid Meier's Civ issue where the buildup is reasonably fun but the endgame devolves into a boring king-of-the-hill struggle.

There's enough I like in Colonial that I feel comfortable with an initial 8.

RATING: 7
One 6p game only

Nice mechanisms mesh together well, but it did run long (4 hours or thereabouts), albeit there was a lot of verbal analysis going on before and after turns, plus it was our first play.

Doesn't pay to make yourself the obvious leader as (especially with 6) leader bashing is fairly easy.

Seem to be several paths to victory - exploring, colonization, and military aggression were all seen.

I like the way certain mechanisms (the 2-stage trade process primarily, although I could include reining in the obvious leader here) encourage co-operation, but others (war, privateers, rebellions) conflict. You need to watch your friends as well as your enemies!

A game with a beautiful illustrated board, 'drool'. For a 3hr+ game, I disliked the possibility of [i]extreme[/i] leader-bashing. A player can loose his or her navy fleet in war, becoming defenseless and then be ganged up by the other players and loose 4/5! out of 10 points in a single round. Navy war is likely to happen due to finite exploring points and scarcity of points in a six player game. I also disliked that a few lucky or unlucky dice roll can decide a game after three hours of point climbing. Furthermore a few unlucky dice rolls when exploring at the start of the game can really give a player an impossible to catch up disadvantage. This game has a really nice card driven action selection mechanism, but that is overshadowed by a serious leader bashing problem and game deciding dice throws resulting in an anticlimax. I'd suggest to 'sail away' from this one and 'explore' something else instead.

When I first came across Colonial I dreamt of great discovery, the columbian exchange, and the race to colonize. 

Sadly the designer abstracted much of this out in favor of a smoother system. But what a system. The dual-use cards within the programming mechanism does a great job of distilling the narrative scope, the R&D and Diplomacy tracks are clean and integrate well, and the dice appropriately depict several random occurances. The art direction is top notch from a grand box cover to the beautiful board to amazing card art. 

I do wish that strength and resources were variable at least with the continents. The non-variable set-up does give the game a samey feel at least at the beginning of plays. However the system works well for what it is and does so in under 3hrs, though apart me still longs for the rich experience I dreamed of.

RATING: 7
Two plays in and this has a lot of potential.  I like how the economics works.  I like the diplomacy track.  The game REALLY needs some scaling for less than five players.  With fewer players it really is an exploration race - you can get to the ten points just by exploration and there is no more efficient way to get VPs.  The simplest solution is to play to more VPs to win with less players.  I have played with three players and with five and the five player game was far more interesting, where war became a genuine option.

Colonial was one of the Spiel 2011 hypes. It is ok but it didn't blow me out of the water - except for the absolutely outstanding board. As is recommended, we played with the advanced colony rules but we probably were too tame in our first game as nobody started a war. I suppose that things get more interesting with more experienced players but I have the nagging feeling that as with many small publishers this game could have needed a professional developer. Just to mention two issues: some of the actions will always be taken, some almost never and attaching 20% of the total needed prestige tokens to a single D6 roll (discovery of Australia) is at least unusual. I would play it again but after playing it I don't have to think any more about purchasing it. My guess is that next Spiel nobody will be talking about this one any more.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Beautiful game board/components.  Choose five of six cards to be activated in sequence with the programming mechanic.  However, each card has a choice of two different actions which can be chosen between when you activate the card giving options and some opportunity to potentially respond to actions of opponents.  

Wooden discs serve in many capacities but generally must be moved from the treasury to become something else.  A few exceptions exist which usually bring about other ramifications.  Avoid falling far behind in the battle for the seas or you can become a punching bag.  

This is a race to 10 prestige so if you don't enjoy the racing aspect to games, avoid.  There can also be a fair bit of kingmaking and some of the roles potentially aid opponents as well as you.  You can instigate rebellions, but probably need someone else to assist in order for them to be effective.

Marrying bright ideas to extremely uneven development seems to be a hallmark of self-published debuts, and Colonial fits the bill. A slick and interesting trading and colonization system weigh heavily on the plus side, but they have to drag clunky combat very random exploration along. Throw a healthy dose of bash-the-leader into the mix, and you have another game blissfully repeating the mistakes of the past. The best thing about playing Colonial might be that it makes you appreciate just how exceptional Eclipse really is.

06/16/12 Played a five-player game (1.7 hour explanation and 3 hours of play). 
I did like the theme, but its far from new. The only thing that made it different were the character cards; the game's saving grace. The five unique white dice are cute, but are an unnecessary expense. They are blank on four sides and have a laurel on the other two. Standard dice could have been easily used by saying a 5 or 6 equals success/laurel. There are not enough tokens. One player ran out of his several times during our game. I'm also not a fan of form over function. In an attempt to make the character cards look "period" they tinted them all tan, with all printing in brown. Brown ink on dark tan cards is low contract, and made the text hard to read. I found the dude used as a universal icon on all the card backs and many of the game components as creepy. I assume he was supposed to be conquistador. But he looked more like Skelator to all of us. The box art was dark, plain, Spartan, and somewhat pedestrian. There were great gobs of what each character did that wasn't on the cards. Plus some of the text was flat wrong (it had changed between this first edition and the second edition). None of this was terrible per se, but it gave an overall feel of rookies at the helm of development and design of this small publisher. In other words, I'm sure if a big company had produced this game it would have had a slicker look. Therefore I took a point off for the design/development poor choices. Yet I'd be happy to play it again.

pre-ordered import from UK after reading rules and BGG geek buddy buzz.

Preliminary rating.  Not sure if this is a 7 or an 8 for me.  Need more plays to assess.  Rules need to stabilize. 

I enjoy this interesting game, but have some concerns.  In the wrong group this game could suffer from kingmaker issues.  It could also degenerate into a tit-for-tat session.

The luck of the dice can hurt too, so that's some concern.  Are there enough rolls to even out the luck?

Beautiful map, one of the best I've ever seen.  Cards very nice as well. Gameplay left me a bit adrift: kind of not much game there.  You use the programmed card arrangement, which sometimes gives some suspense, but not really too much.  Exploration gets too easy late, and is perhaps too much of a game-changer as far as victory points.  No suspense in an around-the-world navegation.  War seems close to pointless, as does privateering, which eliminates many of the options during the game.  If I'd never seen a dozen games like it, I'd say it was good.  At this proce tag with this competition, I can't.

A great game that probably deserves a better ranking than it has. Gameplay is fantastic. Individual player aids detailing all character actions would be a nice addition. Beautifully designed. Deserves more attention than it has received.

such an amazing system.  i think it could have used a couple more months of development to refine the war rules, but i think the community will come up with some options on this front during the next few months. 

i highly recommend moving from the included rules and using the rewritten rules here that have the "FAQ" built into them regarding war and adjancency.  i also like the privateer suggestion where successes gain you a treasury.

A surprisingly euro-ish game that has seen many rules changes/updates, which makes it hard to know whether you're playing by the right rules. As such I have an issue with quite a few aspects of the game, but I have to play it again, reading the most up-to-date rules, to make sure that I am playing the right version. Then I can make a final verdict.

Beautiful game, but the depth doesn't align well with the tone of the art.  I found the rulebook tough to navigate.  The board errs on the side of aesthetics over playability in some areas.  On the initial play, half the "tech advances" were left unused because the others were much better.  Exploration, where success is controlled by a d6 roll, (the chances of which can be modified by tech advances), can lead to easy victory if the competition rolls poorly on the 10 or so opportunities they'll have to explore new regions.  The game is obviously a passion project for the designer, but I found the whole thing pretentious.

I really like this game. It could have been most certainly designed by Wallace himself. It has a couple issues. One, the war is a little fiddly. Two, the nations play odd, as there some that seem more useful than others. Three, there are a couple "rules" that need to be in a player aide, such as when to use colonies and booming cities. Other than that I really like the smooth game play. I recommend it with at least 5 players, as less than that and it becomes to friendly, and less political. I like to have more diplomacy, and more players tend to facilitate that. I really think Wars should be utilized to a greater degree than people think, but for that more streamlined rules for war may be in order. The war rules still work fine, just a little timely. Overall, Great Game!

The game is quite solid. It flows nice. A great option for playing a "civilization" game in under 3 hours.

The only issue I have with it (I only played twice) is king-making in the last rounds of the game. 

Basically, due to the fact that the game finishes as soon as anyone hits 10 points, when you get to 7/8 points, you basically have a target on your back. People will wage wars on you, spark rebellions on your territories and try to take away the monopolies you have.

This gave twice the victory to the 2nd strongest player.

To sum up... you get rapped because everyone will gang up on you. I played this game always with 5 players. Maybe with 3 is better it will not be 4 against 1 in the last rounds. With 2 against 1, maybe the better player of the 90% of the game has a chance of winning.

It is wasnt for this issue, I would give this game a 8.5 or a 9.

Still playing Colonial: Europe's Empires Overseas, although it was distressing that people at last night's gaming were more interested in trying out Small World Underground.

After numerous plays of this game, I am disappointed that I have not felt the need to venture outside the seafaring-logistics tech route. Seafaring is needed to improve the odds of successful exploration, and logistics is needed to maintain (or wrestle) control over resources and territories. Navy has been utterly useless so far. And while there are clear benefits to economy (enables control of 2 unique resources, making easy monopolies), it's expensive and takes too long to reap the benefits. And once a logistics-heavy player has a couple colonies, he doesn't really need economy to trade large numbers of goods.

The designer says games should take about 10 turns, but all of our games have gone much more quickly. We finish in about 6-7 turns, with the longest going 8. By turn 2 or 3, it's pretty common to score 2 prestige per turn, and if you make a booming city, you can easily get 3. Since you only play to 10 prestige, this can make for a quick game. I think it's intended that we do more rebel and sovereign actions, but they honestly don't seem appealing to any of the players so far.

Not sure about this: at the moment I'd still pick Struggle of Empires.
After a couple of plays, the standard game with no national variations is the better option - this might change with many plays but until then I want to play a game to win, not one where I have to spend the first few turns stopping others winning because my special rules mean that I can't start playing until turn 4.

Excellent game of large historical processes using elegant intersecting mechanics.  Card-driven programmed action system.  Gorgeous components.  Economic/trade system is counter-intuitive but rewards players for helping each other out.  Winning requires a thoughtful loading of money, resources, and actions.

Jó játék, bár szerintem a szerencsefaktor elég komoly. Úgy nyert valaki, hogy az utolsó kör előtt megtámadták, szinte minden dologban gyengébb volt mint a támadó, de mivel az hiába dobott legalább 7-8 alkalommal, csak egyszer sikerült neki babért dobnia, ezzel a harc végén át is kellett adnia egy pontot a győztesnek, aki így megszerezte a 9. pontját, innen már gyors volt a befejezés.

A játék kivitelezése fantasztikus, még talán nem is láttam ilyen szép játékot, szép a tábla és a kártyák is. Talán az hiányzik, hogy a kártyák magyar nyelvűek legyenek, akkor megadnám neki a +1 pontot :-). Így marad a 7 mivel az említett szerencsefaktor nagy és a játék hosszúsága is elég sok.

--Oct2011-- Enjoyable, if potentially a bit flawed in the precise details.  It could probably still use a bit more development (not to mention a player aid that made the state of the world's monopolies a bit clearer.)  But, still, it's very entertaining.  I think I'm glad to have bought a copy.
--Nov2011-- Rating decreased.  The last play was during a period of rules-flux:  we'd begun with one set of rules (current, per BGG, the previous evening) and discovered that Christophe had revised the rules - changing our interpretation of them - during our play.  It was a bit frustrating.  I've not tried again with the 2e rules, but I expect that, were I to get it back to the table, I'd find it again appealing and raise my rating.  Nonetheless, I'm currently grumpy.  Perhaps the expansion will include a 1e->2e update kit...

The world map is the most beautiful one I've ever seen in a boardgame. Absolutely wow!
The game itself is also a very good one in my opinion. Elegant mechanics, player interaction and a nice diplomacy track really make this colonization game a medi-weight experience. Had a five-player-game that took us four hours. We played the first edition with the revised rules ... so it developed to the second edition.

RATING: 8
Don't really have the tactics of this one figured, but I had fun with it. Indeed, the initial play-through suffered none of the things I've heard reported - we had one player go for a debt-funded War strategy, only to be foiled by getting stuck on 10 prestige with insufficient income. Another went for an out and out exploration boom - getting America and circumnavigation, whilst somone else went for a viceroy/colony strategy, getting loads of income and monopolies, but lagging on prestige.

By the end, we were all within 2 prestige of each other, with a one player 3 dollars off paying his debt, and the other two neck-and-neck to win that turn. Eventually, it came down to player turn order.

So yeah - interesting game. The only downside is the luck - early on a few bad exploration rolls might not take you out of the game - but it can make it unfun for you.

The game has the most weird mechanics I've ever seen in a game. Reading the rules excited me a lot.

Just like it says on the can, you are looking to colonize areas for your homeland in Europe.

This is one of the best looking games I have ever played! The map is absolutelly gorgeous!!! The game could have been one of the top games I played this year too but it has too many issues in my opinion. Players control colonial powers but the gameplay is somehow too much abstract and an opportunity to construct a dense but not too long thematic 'civ' game was lost. 

Dice and by consequence, luck, is too powerfull in the game. The decisions are important and they work as they are but then again, because the endgame is also abvious Colinial has a bash the leader problem. We tend to play against the player who's running first and that I don't appreciate very much. I also don't like the fact that players don't need any developing condition to conquer distant lands. It does make a certain sense getting a plus one result in the exploring action if you control a neighbour land of the destiny but it doesn't make any sense to me, given the logic of the game, to only depend on a die result in order to make the circumnavigation or discover America. 

Products should really matter something, the differences between them should be more relevant than just a colour. If I want to go further distant in the map it should be because I need this or that product in order to develop my economy and my status quo but that would have to cost me more than a die making it a goal not only a opportunity!

The map is also somewhat under-appreciated because of the rest of the components. They simply don't make justice to the map and I would appreciate more a game with prettier components than just discs and that change would turn the game in a less abstract experience.

Overall a good game but only because of the basics because the game as a whole doesn't work!

Demo/Review copy (I own the UK shop that first sold Colonial)

Unboxing Colonial is a joy - top class components, map is both a thing of beauty and functional i.e all information clearly laid out and visible. Photos on the Geek don't do justice to the board, it has the look of a 16th century map but the blended shades of colour don't impair ability to see game information on the board (and this was the experience playing the game)

Counters are decent thickness.

First play a 2 player 'get to know the rules' and we made the mistake of playing on the African continent (to easy for one player to shut other out of monopolies)

initial impressions were very favourable, despite 2 player not being optimal (for this to shine there needs to no Zero sum in merchant and trader actions) Options, strategies and tactics just seem to unfold as you start playing the game. We called the game after an hour, but talked about the possibilities for another hour - a sign of, potentially, a great game.

Second game with four players caused even more post game analysis and thought. It followed the lines of Out for Blood's session report, was enjoyable, intriguing and part puzzling. It was a four player game with 2 of us 'gamers' and with the benefit of a 2 player exploratory game under our belt. The other two, gamely roped in at London on Board, not inexperienced gamers, but used to slightly lighter fare. When explaining the rules it became obvious, as if i dis not know it already, that this is a gamers game, its very difficult to see the strategies from a rules explanation. Half way through the rules explanation I decided to drop my plans to play with the full colonisation rules because I felt the rules where overwhelming the two new players and I did not want to add to pressure of information they were having to take in. In restrospect i think this was a mistake - or at least i wish we had played with a hybrid with the 'company' and 'Protectorate' being available. From my two games I have come to the conclusion that the full colony rules are essential to play with from the get go. More on this later. 

The rules explanation was quite lengthy - however David and Paul got them and being a friendly we allowed a reordering of endeavour phase when it was clear a key point had not been understood - but this was only in the first two turns. Three of us adoped an early exploration strategy, Conrad went for what i call the 'cuckoo' strategy - logistics, Viceroy, 'Thank you for the goods'. I was aware this could happen so was able to viceroy the East Indies for one and then colonise. On the back of my monopoly, then 3 monopolies i was able to merchant/trade my way to victory. The two new guys tried the same but got hopelessly bogged down - they were getting points for exploration and colonys but had little hope of paying back loans quickly as they did not have the monopolies to replenish their merchant fleets - and thats why i wish we had played with the full Conqueror/ Colony rules as 'Company' is a handy way of replenishing merchant Fleets and getting some much needed Treasuries - merchant is so inefficient with a fleet of two or even, god forbid, one.

My victory was a little anticlimactic - the other players were focusing on their own empires (understandable in a first game) to notice that I was about to win. It's vital to be able to spot an Empire about to repay its loans as theyt are on the way to win and you need to have pegged them back a little before the loan payoff then two or three VP grab for victory.

I really enjoyed planning the four actions in the Endeavor phase, with the 'cuckoo' to my right timing was very important. It will be even more interesting and enjoyable with more experience as when I sensed other players were not playing aggressively I could be a little more speculative and less defensive in my action programming

The other noticeable thing in the game (ala Tim Seitz's report) is we only really played with 50 - 60% of the game; no one increased the economy or navy tech (though iwth benefit of hindsight they should), no one went to war (I had a clear situation where I should have but felt it was harsh in a learning game), rebel was hardly used (playing too nice) and lastly, and I think most importantly, because we were feeling our way in  to the rich game system the opportunities for negotiation were not explored as fully as they should have been. Negotiation rules are covered in a very small paragraph in the rules but might be the most important ingredient. I suspect for the full game to blossom the game needs aggression, bullying, threats and temporary alliances to blossom. Someone who builds up a strong fleet (and even better a navy/privateer force) can hold merchants to ransom, the rebel action needs to be used as a bargaining chip as well as a way of pegging back other players. I wonder if a no loan 'extortion' strategy might work? 

There was negotiation in the game about the merchant and trading action, however because the two new players had got into a bind with too few monopolies/merchant ships they were picking up scraps from the larger fleets.

We all struggled to see the point of developing economy. However, in a game where there had been more agression the game would have lasted longer and those goods in China and India that require level six would have become vital. I suspect that the sweet spot for players is five, and the competition for monopolies. goods and easy territory to explore would make the economy/governor strategy more viable, if not essential

No one touched Navy either - and I will be surprised if many people go there in there first game. However, a large navy could be absolutely devastating. Wars are resolved on land, market, Treasuries then navy. If the navy man is careful to make sure he has no presence in the first three (or at least no potential for conflict with his victim) then he could score a VP every round just by the threat of destroying other players merchant fleets after he has creamed their navy. 

After only two plays though there feels like an urgency to get exploring and merchanting asap - this might be a beginners mistake. It will take me a few more plays to see whether you can sit behind the early VP/goods leaders and then overtake them with this approach, or even if it leaves another part of your game to weak.

Next time I play the game with new players I will point out the 'Cuckoo' strategy, and emphasise the fact that negotiation is essential. It also worth playing with gamers who don't mind, or better still, enjoy aggression in games. And there will be a next time, I absolutely love the game system and the theme, i now want to explore the timing and use of the parts underutilised in my first two games.

The third game was with five, three players new to the game but had all invested time in learning the rules. We played with the 'advanced' colony rules - and as i thought its the only way to play, and i would advise any new players to start with the full colony rules - they make the game more liquid, help players with few monopolies get merchant ships and can help paying off loans. Five feels like the right number, there was a little more specialisation with the economy and naval tracks being used. There was also a lot more negotiation, aggression. threats, alliances - just general interaction. I managed a close win by lagging behind on the Victory points (no target painted on my forehead), building up a new income stream then a sprint for the line. That sprint included a war, and to win it I took a loan as the fifth action in the penultimate turn battered my victim with my first Endeavor action of the last turn, then discovered Australia and paid off my loan. 

War in Colonial is brutal - you need to be aware at all times for opportunities to attack other players; to either go to war or to use it as a tool of extortion. In the post match analysis other players thought they should have used it more. Its especially dangerous if you contest the multi good regions, and one player fell behind because he made himself a target in West Africa. The merchant action was used by most players too early in the game for small returns (i think you should not be too frightened of taking 2 loans, to be pegged back by the rebel action other players have to forgo Viceroy and you start to earn large in the middle to late game). 

Choice of which track to go up on was partly determined by other players choices. I wanted to try the economy route but the other players sprinted up the logistics  track so I felt i had to keep pace. The VP/Good(s) from the booming city is very important, so an early move to 4 is important. In my next game I am going to go six early to get those goods in China and India. Two players chose to go up the naval track and it 1) Made them immune to Wars 2) meant I was not going to contest goods with them.

The choices on each of the cards is a difficult one and at first some players had the impression that 'Rebel' and 'Ambassador' were redundant because they would  forego 'Viceroy' and 'Explore' - not so. For a lot of the rounds I chose these actions last to see what other players did, the rebel was very good at pegging back other players. Exploring every round opens the boards to the players to your left, so moving up the diplomacy track early is a good way of setting up a Viceroy 'cuckoo' action (saves you from a War) and strategically useful for the middle late game. 

Timing of Merchant and Trader is pretty crucial; possible even more so is the many little and incremental negotiations of  who gets to use your spare capacity. But even more important is getting other players to let you use their spare capacity; these small and incremental treasury gains can make or break your game.

Privateers were used as an extortion tool against me, but a little to late in the game. I think going hard into privateers early is a good idea - but will probably need a second early loan.

The game was tough and made so by the negotiations. On an impressionistic and non analytical level the game fired up some of the same responses I have had from playing Cosmic Encounter, Greed and Diplomacy, wheras i was expecting to feel similarities with 'Age of Empires 3' and'Struggle of empires'.  My third game was with the 'right' group - we all know each other well enough not to take the negotiations to heart and everyone engaged with the meta game. I have explained the game to a lot of friends (any excuse to put the board on the table - its so evocative and beautiful) and many have said 'not for me' - if don't like negotiation then don't play this game, and I would the experience would be quite painful if one player just did their own thing on the board.

My feelings about the game are still evolving - i like it and I would love to  play this with experienced players more often, and this may be the games flaw for me The curse/blessing of being a London gamer is that my games group is about 300 strong - so most plays of new games are with people who need to be taught the game - and its a game that you only begin to savour after a few plays.

I found the luck factor to determining for the length of the game. I also had the feeling that some aspects of the game didn't get enough attention and seemed more like an afterthought. This might be due to the play style of the group, but I also feel that if we played differently, that would have dragged the game even longer.
I won, by the way.

That's right, I put this as a 10 after 1 play.  I have never felt this confident about my love for a game as I do now.  Economy?  War?  Rebellion?  Exploration?  Hells yeah, it's all there.  The ONLY complaint I have is maybe dice, but you have ways to improve your odds a bit with Seafaring or having more units than your enemy - but dice can still be dice(try rolling zero successes on 10 attempts...it happened a few times for sure).

This has the potential to be very good. Role based cards are arranged in order, somewhat like Roborally. Then you use them to go an explore and exploit the rest of the world. One of the players had to leave part way through, so we didn't play it to completion, but it definitely looks promising.

2nd ed. rules with 1st ed. copy. Not sure why but had a miserable time trying to grasp what everything does.

Competition seems encouraged in a couple of ways. There can only be one "booming city" at a time, and having it means you get a cut every time people work goods through the trading system. This creates incentive for others to build the next booming city, and it has to be larger than the present one.

Also the primary way to get more merchant fleets (needed to get goods to market) is to buy them at turn end, but the purchase rate is capped by how many products you have a monopoly on. If you have none, and worse, if you converted your fleets into settlements (which you can do for free following an exploration), you may find it difficult to make money.

I like how you can ship others' goods if they let you, with both of you benefiting. They can generally refuse, but does it make sense to?

War is a little odd in that the land war is fought within regions by the settlements that are there. And it's very dice-dependent. There isn't even a technology relevant to being militarily stronger "in general," except for the Navy track (which just lets you buy more at a time). So in any region where you expect to win a war, you're probably already dominant, and you'd only start a war into order to steal VP.

...I think that what is "wrong" with the game is that it's a race game where it's not clear that you're better off meddling with other players. Like Power Struggle. First to 10 points wins, and the most direct ways to get those points are exploring the world (where you can interfere with other players only by beating them to the punch) and building colonies (which you [i]could[/i] interfere with... Or you could worry about making your own).

great looking game; few pieces but many strategies involved; diplomacy plays a big deal in deciding who to have confrontation with and when to have it; played first as a 3 player, but 4 player became much harder and much more involved;  played the first games with basic rules -- with the advanced rules and more players along with a more comfortable feel of the rules, I can see this game being rated higher; good stuff and a very unique feel to the game

The standout feature of this game is how the mechanics, while streamlined, really bring out the narrative and flavor of the historical period in such an impressive and satisfying way. The game board also helps in this regard, as it is easily the most beautiful I have ever seen, and along with the other high quality components goes a long way to justify the hefty price tag. Colonial uses a simultaneous action selection system that along with the other clever Euro trappings leads to smooth and exciting game play with little downtime. While luck is present, it is nicely balanced by the many ways that players can help and hurt each other. The game can suffer a bit from leader-bashing, but with careful planning there are ways to mitigate it as you reach for those final VP. 

Definitely use the updated "Rules 502". UPDATE: apparently there are even newer rules. Guess I need to try those sometime.

Don't ever play it with less than five people.
Revised rules play a little better, but still the game doesn't feel finished/balanced.

Takes some time to build the economic engine, but once you have that controlled, the rest is pure interaction between players and becomes a race for being the first to pay the loans. It works quite well for 2 players with the nations variant but it's clearly a game for groups.

A very nice idea with broken rules (first edition) which needed repeated FAQs and official rulings by the designer to remedy. It's really a shame that this needed a second edition to iron out the quirks.

Solid gamer's game from the Essen 11 crop.  Good negotiating potential that doesn't drag on.  Tough decisions to be made on which character choice to use as well as where to expand and how much to invest in naval defense posture.  Game mechanics flow fairly quick without a lot of down time but a full game with six experience players is likely to run about 3 hours.  Beautiful components throughout despite some comments that the map graphics blend it with some informational data.  I don't find it obtrusive.  I can see some comparisons to Navegador based on the theme but this one is much more involved.  I welcome the new rule(s) changes in v1.1.  Though minor, it's nice that they eliminated two conflicts on land and beefed up the options for the naval fleets and merchants. Glad I snagged a copy.

I think most of the negative comments I've read about this one are right on.

*  Not well developed
*  Disincentive to attack as a real strategy
*  Many actions seem relatively irrelevant (privateers?)
*  Leader bashing

Very happy with this game.  Manages to neither dodge nor gloss-over the parts of Imperialism and Colonialism necessary (ie, slavery) to represent a Game of Empires set in the period.  Fun, light multiplayer AT game with just enough direct player interaction to keep the brain humming.

I can deal with games where politics and kingmaking play huge roles, but not when a single game takes more than 3 hours. Also, the game has a lot of little rules that could have used some reminders.

2nd edition.  Has some issues with kingmaking which can be solved through variants.  Also I think the variant where you get an unrest if you fall off the diplomacy track or cause yourself to go down.  This wil stop people  spamming the unrest supression glitch. 

Also I think restricting merchant/trade to the following order: booming city (first), then player, then other players is best way to solve lots of money being passed about.

This game doesn't work with 4; the game is too open -- 5 or 6 is best.

In 4 players I strictly think using my other variant of instigator whilst rebel would work too where you can choose to put 1 or 2 unrest but putting 2 down causes you to drop down diplomacy track.

Other than that its a very good, albeit quite stressful game at times.

-----

After playing it 12+ times, I'm really tired of this game. The game takes way way too long. I also get flustured at explaining rules and controlling the game flow.

The game is also showing its age against better games and I think there is too much money and no hard decisions in a game where money becomes plentiful.  I do not think I'll be playing Colonial gain; unless its got eurofied scoring and has a better decision process than simply agreeing to no-brainer trade deals.

Pretty much retiring the game and putting it on ice.

First play confirmed my expectations. Graspable rules (can be explained in 20-25 minutes, little need to refer to rule book during game), open-ended play, high player interaction, good thematic fit. EDIT: After more plays, making this a 10.

It's faults are:
1. The zombie pirate figure used in the game logo and elsewhere is in stark contrast to the tasteful design everywhere else.
2. A few of the silhouette native figures on the board are a little hard to see.
3. Circumnavigation seems to give a VP too easily, especially with fewer players. I don't play with it any more.
4. The Diplomacy track is a bit underpowered. I play with variant rules that add unrest in one of your colonies if you do punishable things while at the bottom of this track.

Best cartographic map for a boardgame ever. Gameplay wise I like the different role cards and the workflow of the game. The trading and merchanting are done well. 
The game really fascinates me. 

There are however some issues though. 

The warfare card and resulting naval battle doesn't really protect your monopolies which is very important. 
There is no connection between your navy and your land forces. 

Starting a war is not very beneficial since others will prey on you if you weaken yourself by starting a war resulting in defensive playstyles. 

There are too many prestige points to be earned for exploration. 

The economy track and especially the naval track don't feel as usefull or critical compaired to the logistic or exploration track. 

The diplomacy track can be gamed, the left spot can be camped without negative things happening.

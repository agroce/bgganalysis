Fun with action points!  When the system isn't cumbersome with dozens of action options, you have the opportunity for a fairly smooth-playing game, like this one.  The theme could be better integrated, but overall it was a fun game to play.  I love the idea of using the cubes as customers and money and points.  The scoring was almost a little too simplified, and perhaps the game didn't have enough paths to victory.  Overall, very nice execution in a reasonably-sized box!

After watching the UndeadViking video review I was keenly waiting for this to arrive. I bought coloured meeples to replace the cubes that come with the game and had rated the game an 8 in mid Jun 2013 after the video and rules read. 

I've since downgraded the rating to 6 after a first play in late Jun 2013. I/We just didn't get a "Sims-Theme Hospital" feel from this at all. It's a rather pedestrian meeple draw fest, some potentially interesting ideas but it just wasn't fun. We all agreed this was one of the more disappointing games we'd played recently given the anticipation. It will get another play just to be sure.

Very simple to play. Trying to handle all of the patients that accumulate can make things feel pretty hectic. Wasn't too sure about the initial player interaction with being able to send a patient to another player but it actually works quite nicely. Only thing that feels a little lacking is the final scoring in the game; just feels like there's a little something missing. Decent game overall but just wasn't enough to make us want to play it. Traded away.

There is simply a lot of elements of the game (engine building, auctions, spatial elements) that don't work together and/or lack meaningful decisions. The game feels haphazardly put-together and incomplete. It's like the designer knew the mechanical elements that gamers love without any understanding of how they work to produce interesting and tense decisions. 

The component quality, artwork, and price-point are all very attractive. Unfortunately, the game simply isn't there.

RATING: 4.5
This wasn't quite as good as I thought it was going to be. I love tile placement games generally, and I liked the idea of trying to make an efficiency engine that has to cope with the constant influx of new patients. 

Unfortunately, the gameplay had a lot to be desired. The first player gets to take a full turn while putting grey cubes on his opponents' hospitals right away, thus giving them a huge disadvantage on their first turn. Also, the game doesn't seem to be punishing enough if you don't treat patients in line. Since I had the Lab, I could just cure greysles and use them to buy more tiles, while ignoring my ever-increasing line of patients. The lame bonus at the end for having treated everyone in line is not incentive enough to attempt it, and in my first play I actually thought my score was far too high for having played poorly in comparison to my husband.

Its the crazy hospital game where the rooms are made up and the points don't matter!  Everyone seems to come out with the scores of +/-1 of each other and experienced players don't seem to fair any better.  The tiebreaker rules are a bit silly.  Having the fewest nurse units breaks a tie?  I thought I was trying to get those!  I suppose its more efficient, but thats not really fun.

Keeping the patient cubes in sequence can be a problem for some players.  Some new players are annoyed that even though multiple beds are pictured on the tiles, you may only place one patient on the tile.

There is no engine building here.  Patient cubes are distributed in meager amounts, so its not possible to really scale up things.

Horrible rule book. Layout is good (minus the special room appendix which stinks), but how the rules are explained is so difficult to work through it makes for a large learning curve. Clearly the rules were written by the designer and didn't go to a technical editor.

Additionally, the optimal way to score points actually conflicts with the theme. Felt wrong to work on winning.

I had the great pleasure of playing a prototype with the designer at BIGCON in 2011.  This is a solid Euro with action point allowance and tile laying.  This is a definite purchase for me as it plays smoothly with many paths to victory (and plays in an hour or under).  Cannot wait to see the published version with its updated rules!

RATING: 6
Decent designer, truly terrible publisher.

As for the game itself. Mechanically interesting in the use of cured patients to purchase additional rooms, but a little unbalanced and very simple in its scoring. Could have greatly benefited from the use of, say, poker hand-style bonuses (e.g. three of one colour followed by two of another - a full house - for 6 bonus points).

Overall: nice idea, poor execution. Rather disappointing all round and only deserving of a 7 due to a fan-created scoring variant that is vastly superior to the one presented in the rules.

RATING: 7.3
My better half picked this up on his own, to my surprise.  I thought perhaps it would be too much like Pandemic, but rest assured this is a completely different game, and rather interesting.

On your turn you have two sets of mandatory things to do - queue up 4 patients to your hospital's entrance, and take 4 actions which usually involve expanding your hospital or treating patients.  You can mix those up as you please, and the patients can be sent to your hospital, or another player's.  Mixed in with those patient cubes are gray disease cubes, which you use to put rooms in other players' hospitals under quarantine.  So naturally another possible action is to decontaminate rooms which were previously quarantined.

This is a pretty good game with more strategy involved than you'd expect.  It felt a bit too long to me, however - and I'm not sure it works as well 2-player as it should.  You do have to be prepared to be ruthless, because much of the game involves "attacking" other players - whether it's those nasty gray cubes, or stealing a new room that was put up for bids with a building contract.  On the plus side, this game is ripe for expansion, because new rooms could be added to the mix.  I'll certainly play this more in the future, but I don't know if I'd suggest it myself.

This game seems broken.  The gray cubes that are placed on opponent's hospital to spread disease are just annoying.  It seems that there are so many of them that much time is spent just taking them back off on your turn.  Plus the game suffers from the syndrome where the player who is winning is picked on by other players until the game is even again.

Played with my family (4 players) for the first time. It took 20 min just to explain all the rules so that everyone understood them. The game play was fun, but we pulled so many graysles out of the bag that we seemed to spend all of our actions on decontaminating tiles -- so we bought very few additional rooms. At the end of the game, we all had wait lines that had a minimum of 8 patients each.
For now, the game is a 6 or 7. We'll see if it improves with more plays.

Something about this one just didn't work.  The drafting mechanic is very interesting, but it's layered on top of a game that's almost too small for it's own good.  Add on a really ruthless mode of player interaction which loads the game with dead turns (potentially) which you can't afford (again too small) and there's a lot of potential lost I think.  I will watch the designer's next efforts with interest, but this one's out the door.

What the game boils down to is the random cube draw, shuffling patient cubes and rooms around, and fiddling with less than exciting special room abilities. This game looked like it may have some kind of engine building capabilities, but because of the random cube draw you don’t really end up doing anything with any purpose. The special ability tiles COULD be neat, but they just kind of move stuff around, give you an action here and there, or let you cure a couple extra people. You definitely do improve the efficiency of your hospital, but just slightly. Once everyone advances their hospital to a certain point, less than half way through the game once you’ve played, you are basically just pulling cubes, shuffling them around, sticking your opponent with annoyances... and that’s it! I can’t emphasize enough how dry and methodical the whole pulling of cubes part of the game is. It gets old real fast.

And, the “Graysles” are especially wonky. More than once, a player pulled mostly grey cubes on their turn, which they of course placed on opponents’ hospital tiles. The grey cubes just take an action to clear (unless you have a special ability to clear more than one at a time). The game just boils down to an action count. Clear some grey cubes. Clear some colored cubes. Buy a building or two. Clear more cubes. See who has the most scored patient cubes. Target them. Repeat. It’s repetitive cube juggling!

RATING: 3
Excellent component quality: sturdy box, heavy tiles, nice cubes (gray and green almost indistinguishable for me) and hefty wooden action markers.  Unfortunately, the game is Just Another Soulless Euro (JASE).  It's a cube-pusher with a pasted-on theme and no interesting decision making.  It's dry, dull and computational.  Tile laying aspect virtually unimportant.  "Special Rooms" add variety without adding interest.  Abandoned before completing the first play.

RATING: 4
This game is either to flat for its length or too long for its arc, however you want to look at it. There’s a mildly interesting logistical aspect of filling your hospital with patients (colored cubes need to go their respective rooms and only 1 cube per room), but the game lack another element to hold interest, namely, a way to create synergies among tiles the way you do in Suburbia. And due to the logistical considerations, player turns can take a couple minutes each such that it’s close to 10 minutes till it’s your turn again. So, the game comes down to using a few bonus powers to aid your logistical exercise; played in an hour that might be interesting enough as an appetizer but it’s too mild to justify the 90+ minute length and feels repetitive right quick. 

The coup de gras is that there’s a random cube draw such that you may pull patients which score you points or you may pull gray cubes which hurt other players. It’s no fun to be the table police while others are scoring points simply due to a random draw. In short: Suburbia does this kind of experience in a much more interesting way.

RATING: 6
Not so much theme hospital the board game however it is quite a nice little resource management game. 

The cafeteria giving a free action token at the start of turn is ridiculously overpowered and so is removed from our games.

A single point for clearing your line also feels a little disappointing.

Scores are generally quite close and we are all enjoying this atm, however the majority of us have said we are not sure how much re playability is actually here.

Game felt entirely too random and monotonous, as well as lopsided for the winning player, due to randomness of cube draw coupled with cube impact, despite the innovative auction mechanic for tiles.

Four colour cubes representing different diseases need to be cured in their respective hospital rooms — but watch out for grey infection cubes because they need to be cleared first. Cubes, however, are delivered by each player on their turn, and with the number of moves you may find yourself spending cubes to buy expansions to speed things up as well. A simple but complex game that has lots of options. However, player order makes a huge impact.

PLUS: competitive, fairly easy to grasp, different tiles available per game

In a fair world, I shouldn’t even be talking about this game. We played wrong in like 12 different ways, so we weren’t experiencing it as intended. I’m not one of these clowns who believes you can’t form an opinion on a game until you’ve played it at least a dozen times, but in all fairness, we didn’t play this game, we played some effed-up version of it. Sadly, ours is a fallen, flawed world. There are some nifty things here. The wait line, and the strategy of sending folks to others’ hospitals, is a nice idea. The fact that the way you design your hospital might score you more points, but also makes you vulnerable is another interesting idea…in theory. In practice it engenders a “take that” element that results in most of your actions being wasted on removing contamination instead of doing what the game is supposedly about. The game is called “Quarantine”, however, so it means to put its most un-fun and annoying idea front and center. There’s interaction and conflict, and then there’s petty slap-fights, and this is the latter. Still, I’d give it another shot.

Based on a single play, the theme is nice, the game is quick enough, but I found that some special room tiles are so over-powering that it may be as simple as to always do the same action 4 times every turn to secure a win. I'll revise after more plays. Also the end of game condition can cause a player to have one less turn than others, this seems like a very bad idea.

RATING: N/A
This is a game design that I have been steadily developing since late 2009, and which will see publication in 2013. It's not my first game design, but it's the one I'm enjoying the most right now.

The game uses the concept of "price drafting", whereby players set the price on tiles they would like to acquire, but all the other players have a chance to buy first. This makes setting the correct price key to success.

The quarantining mechanic also enables a really neat dynamic: you have control over which tiles make up your hospital and their positions relative to eachother, but your opponents have some level of control over which of them are available to you at a given time. Adding the right special tiles to your hospital is key, but even more key could be the spatial element of positioning them well such that the quarantined area does not spread as quickly or in such a harmful way.

Another thing that I worked hard to inject into the game is the concept of creative play. There are many interesting and powerful ways that the tiles can combine with eachother. The game system is rather open - providing a framework for the players to experiment in and come up with creative and even surprising moves.

I hope you all enjoy playing the game as much as I do.

Oooh, a hospital theme!  And I fell hook, line and sinker for this stinker.  If you want to play a game where it actually feels like all you're doing is pushing cubes, this is the title for you.  In fact, not only are you essentially pushing cubes but you're lining up the cubes as well!  What could be more exciting that progressively and slowly lining up and pushing cubes?

Game mechanics looked very intriguing but in practice they fall flat. There is no playing hard or well- everyone still seems to come out with around the same score. I'm currently experimenting with some rules variants to liven it up.

Good ideas, but it leaves a taste of something missing: maybe the tiles cost, the placement rules (which lead to forced hospital settings to avoid disease spread), or something else. It's fun and light, maybe not so elegant. Missed occasion.

I keep seeing people complain about the random cube draw. If you are playing the theme it makes sense. Do hospitals know what patients are coming in? Are the always ready to deal with them? I know I line up at my hospital for hours on end.

I rather enjoyed this game. I could not give it a ten though due to no consequence for not serving the line up. Keeping an eye on the graysles helps otherwise your hospital begins to be ineffective. I personally believe there should have been a little more as I felt it was easy to keep under control. That would make for more chaos. Maybe an introduction of a second infection, like black cubes as the plague.

the central theme of managing a hospital to maximized efficiency is demeaning and depressing.  You would think that the theme of helping people and managing the hospitals resources  would be a positive.  To really effectively play though hospital administrators are rewarded for patient dumping onto competing hospital  and overwhelm their resources, even creating viral outbreaks..

Played my first game of Quarantine tonight (6/6/2013) with the aid of designer Mark Klassen at my FLGS, Craving For A Game, in Surrey, B.C., Canada.
 
Quarantine was easy to learn and get into right away. (Our first game was particularly cutthroat and *cough* I came in last as is usual *cough*!)The components are heavy, nicely coloured with appropriate icons in place of text, and won't take up a lot of table space. I love the velvety bag the patients are drawn from! 

Each game will be different due to the game's set up procedures so this game will see a lot of re-plays in my group. 

I'm not particularly fond of bidding wars or auctions in my games but Quarantine's "Price-Drafting" mechanic really appealed to me.

Thanks to Buck, our host at Craving.
Thanks to Mark for Quarantine and his time. Looking forward to Mark's next project.

P.S. Did I mention the velvety bag?

All looks pretty groovy and there are some interesting decisions to explore, but ends up feeling like a  computational procession. The harsh realities of action points (including the save an action for later action), the arbitrary take-that of spreading infections and the fact that you can't plan your turn in advance makes for a game I'd rather avoid.

Giochino strategico che non mi ha per nulla colpito, anche se provato solo una volta. Il gioco è un piazzamento tessere abbastanza casuale e ripetitivo. Casuale dovuto alla estrazione dei pazienti e ripetitivo perché non offre troppe dinamiche anche se le azioni possibili nel proprio turno sono sette. Il giochino si presta anche a forte kingmaking dovuto a distribuzione di virus (cubetti grigi).

Picking gray cubes out of the bag on your opponents turn and then they tell you to put those disease cubes in your hospital makes you start hating your hand for picking those cubes.  Especially when you get 3/4 gray cubes multiple rounds.  It's a fun game, but I need to play it more.

Quarantine introduces a innovative theme to the boardgame world.  I like how Mark incorporated many elements of the medical field into his design, but still ensured that the game worked for his target audience.  The component quality is superb and enhances the playing experience tremendously. However, I had a few gripes with the rules.  Some rules needed diagrams to explain the game process (set-up including the market, a visual explanation of the open tile contract action) and other rules were needlessly complicated (final scoring with half points per coloured block and quarter points per grey block if lab is present). Overall, I enjoyed the game and look forward to playing it more.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The theme influences the rating a bit for me. I love the idea of players each building their own competing hospital. The different color cubes do an adequate job of representing people with the different illnesses and the different tile powers are interesting enough. Overall, the game is not with it's merits, but the whole experience feels a bit stiff. The rule where you have to yell "NEXT PATIENT" is humorous at first, but quickly realized as a pointless attempt to inject flavor into the game.

RATING: 6.5
Interesting game but I'm concerned that certain rooms kinda screw up the core game. Worse, I feel like the core 'I bid on this room but you can snatch it from me if you are lucky/have better cube type manipulation' is flawed and the extra action point does not adequately offset to screwage that ensues.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fun puzzle game that has a bit of a take that aspect.  The contracts are the real heart of this game.  When to bid and especially what to bid on first and discovering the synergy of the special tiles is key to this game.  You aretrying tobe efficient and sometimes having areas quaratined isn't too bad.  One bad thing is it needs more special tiles to up to replayability.  I'm just knit picking it is a good solid game.

First play tonight, 2 players. The game seems slow at first as it's hard to buy new rooms because you are constantly curing the graysles disease.  About 3/4 through the game it starts getting really good and you don't want it to end just yet.  

The hospital theme is cool, something new for a change. The artwork is fantastic and the components are excellent.

Rating may change as more games are played, but as it stands for the first game, we liked it a lot. Recommended - and it's not too hard as a family game.

I have had access to the development of Quarantine since the beginning of 2011.  At its heart, it is a combo engine building game where players' hospitals become more than the sum of their parts.  The decision tree is broad and there is no obvious path to victory.  The presence of a "take-that" element successfully keeps each player within reach of victory.  I am interested to see how far Mark can take Quarantine.  Good luck man!

Nice tile/cube pusher. Theme works well within the game. Also like they way that you use the patients cured as currency to buy/bid for new room tiles.

Have tried 2 and 4 player games, and feel that with more players, you don't quite seem to have enough turns to fully develop your hospital.

Also feel that you should be penalised for finishing with patients queuing to be admitted.

Despite this, still an enjoyable game and theme.

Finally got the opportunity to play this one. I have had it since March. 

My first game was two players. My fiance and myself found the game fun and rather light. The contract idea is neat and probably different with more players, but in two it is an exercise in trying to put up colors that your opponent won't have access to or won't be willing to pay. Otherwise it is a fairly simple tile laying game with an auction type mechanism. I look forward to playing this a little more, but I don't see it climbing much higher than it is now. I am sure we will play this more in the coming months and have fun with it, but I don't see this becoming a favorite. But you never know!

I remember reading press about this game back before it was released and being very interested in it.  I finally got a chance to play it and sadly the game is more interesting on paper than it is in action.

The game just feels so woefully incomplete and lazy.  Like the designer set out to make a game and got this big chunk finished and just decided to wrap a bow around it and call it a day.

The basic premise of the game is a tile-laying experience where each player is trying to build a successful hospital while also sabotaging their opponents hospitals by quarantining their rooms.  Each round 4 cubes are drawn from a bag, either patients or quarantine markers, and you can choose to put them in either your or another players hospital then take four actions that include many options from admitting and curing patients, buying new rooms for your hospital, and eradicating disease to unquarantine rooms.

I will say that the cube assignment mechanic is kind of new and refreshing.  I don't see any reason why you would ever quarantine your own hospital rooms but choosing where to place patients is interesting.  Curing them turns them into a kind of currency for this game so you want to put them in your line but at the same time they come in 4 different colors and you have a limited number of rooms that can admit them.  So cluttering up your opponents lines with multiple patients of the same color can slow them down.

That's about all that is good I can say about the game though.  Like I said, everything else feels incomplete and lazy.  The rulebook is poorly written and had us scratching our head over some weird rule interactions.  The tiles themselves were unbalanced and uninteresting.  The way new rooms are bought was unnecessarily convoluted like the designer wanted to try something new or clever but instead just made it weirdly complex.  I also hate games with so few points to spread around, it gives the feeling that you aren't really going anywhere or that you can't really make gains on your opponents and this game has very few to hand out.

All in all, this is something that sounded interesting and had potential but seemed to be rushed or simply just not designed well.  Avoid.

Don't mistake my relatively low rating here. It's actually a solid game. It was simply sold to me on the premise that it was 'Theme Hospital' as a board game, which it is not. It is a decent game. Amazingly entertaining for a game about standing in line.

Really.

RATING: 5
Very good theme play.  Easy to learn and play.  Game is centered on the luck of the patient draw - do you get patients (VPs) or disease cubes?  Players spend actions mostly removing disease cubes from their hospital.  The components are very good - thick chits, wood playing pieces & velvet bag.  Artwork is average.  The rulebook is very good.  Our first play was a little over 1.5 hours, which seemed to drag.

I'm not quite sure how to rate this. It feels like there are some good ideas here - I especially like some of the bonus rooms which seem to work exactly how they should based on their names. 

I like the idea of bidding for tiles and receiving bonus actions if you're outbid. I love how nurses stations spread infection but you score for them at the same time.

Unfortunately, it just feels a little underdeveloped. There's no scope for being able to mitigate bad patient draws; I went an entire game drawing no green patients and so completely unable to bid for 2 useful tiles that sat in the middle taunting me. I think this felt worse because in the previous game I'd had a Lab and so had been able to use 2 grey cubes as any colour and so being doubly restricted felt frustrating.

Additionally, with 4 players all playing pretty competently, the scores were 9-9-10-10. That felt a little too balanced. Is there scope for being rewarded for exceptional play? I'm not yet convinced.

Could not understand building stealing mechanism.  Why anyone would want to waste a turn to build a room if everyone could steal it away. Could see you easily being able to ice someone out in a 4 player game.  We played with two and it just did not feel like it worked.  Spend more time trying to understand why mechanisms were added to the game rather then actually trying to enjoy the game.

First Impression:
Another great theme completely wasted. 

So what is good about this game? I'm trying hard but I really can't really find anything I really liked about it.

The mechanics manage to both not make sense in a thematic way and fail to create any significant strategy or tactics. The patients' randomness is too much, and the take that element (in a game that was supposed to be a family one) is absurb. The game even has downtime! - you have nothing to think of while you wait for your turn. Even the rooms are completely indifferent..

Seriously, the game made such an awfull impression to me that I'm having second thoughts if we really played it correctly - it can't possibly be that bad.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
[thing=109764][/thing] is a game that does offers decisions: the positioning of rooms (not all that relevant, however, but is important for some special rooms and the break room for the nurses), which rooms to get and how much to price them, which patients to take in and which to give to others. They aren't hard choices to make, but are there.

Another positive of the game is the replay value: not only the patients will come at a random order, changing the possibilities and costs of special rooms, but also the available rooms for the play will also be randomized. The game is also surprisingly thematic, from the way the special rooms work to the coming of patients, specially here in Brazil, where lines to be admitted in hospitals is, sadly, way too common.

On the not so  good side, [thing=109764][/thing] has a good amount of "take that" in the game, in the form of the disease cubes (gray cubes) that are put on other players hospitals in order to block rooms and cost one action to clean each of them. This isn't a terrible thing, specially if the hospital doesn't have complete nurse rooms (which spread disease faster), but can hinder someone a lot if the others gang up to "bash the leader" - though there are rooms that can use the disease cubes to gain points or to fight them better, however they might not be in all games, due to the random nature of the rooms available.

Overall, [thing=109764][/thing] to me is simple a tolerable game - it doesn't offend, nor is truly bad, it just fail to make me want to play it again. I wish the placement of rooms was more relevant - I don't even see the theme in this, as hospitals don't constantly change what is where. As it is, [thing=109764][/thing] has a strong potential, but in its current form, is badly explored, making what could be a great game into a merely OK one.

What a pleasant surprise this was.  Build your hospital a la Alhambra style, with tiles, and treat patients in order to earn income and expand your hospital.  This game is a lot more in-your-face than I expected - you can really mess with your opponents by quarantining off sections of their hospital.  Random "bonus" rooms at the start make for lots of variation game-to-game.  Good stuff all around.

(After 2 4p games) - First play was with more "serious" gamers and met with "meh", but the 2nd play was with more "like most games" gamers and they enjoyed it.  They wanted to play again, but we were out of time at the FLGS.

Action points, tile placement - curing patients, building a hospital to cure patients and rooms todo "special" things.   It is pretty thematic and I wish it played just a touch faster.  There is some randomness with the cube draws.   Our games have been a bit low scoring (8 to 16 points range).

Game one - forgot the rule about whoever set a contract out gets an extra action marker each time a room is bought by an opponent.

Game two - forgot the rule about being able to play patients in other people's lines.  Although that was on the player aid here on BGG.

Not "euro heavy", not "gateway light". I really like the balance between fun and challenge in this game.

The theme in this game is probably my favorite part, I haven't seen good and thematic hospital management games out there and this one fits the theme very well. The mechanics make sense and most of them are very original and clever.

The lack of strategies are probably my least favorite part. This game has a really strong meta, so it doesn't estimulate you to try something different than the obvious. A lot of combos are restricted in the rules and even if they were allowed, the fact that you can't have more than four patients per turn makes it impossible to scale up during late game. This doesn't make Quarantine a bad game, but it could probably be so much better if there were less restrictions and more wombo-combos!

I haven't tried this with more than 2 players though. My opinion can still change. But my wife loves to play it with just the two of us.

My first 2 player game had me thinking this might be a bit light for gamers, yet still a bit heavy for family play... but a four player game at my local FLGS convinced me this is a good time with gamers after all!  You need about a full player count for the contract mechanic to really work and that added with the subtleties of timing your actions/patient draws makes for a slightly deeper game than you see at first glance.

Just boring.  Never want to see this one again.

Fun tile layer where you can kind of attack each other by infecting the other people's hospital but that also means you earn less money because you are losing potential customers.  Doesn't last too long and has some cool special ability tiles.  Has some building and action management but nothing brain burning or automatic either.

My wife really likes this, not overly complicated but not over simplified.   Good game. Could be easily expanded upon.  Good components. Great value.

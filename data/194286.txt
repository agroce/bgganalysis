I do not like it. I think it is more complex than it needs to be. Set-up takes too much time. I like the general idea of the game but not its implementation.

I feel like having something shorter and less involved than full Catacombs would be good.  Flick em Up just doesn't seem right to me while Catacombs and Castles seems to be the perfect solution. Integration with Catacombs is a bonus.

This is an excellent game! If you love base Catacombs combat but dont want to have to spend hours setting up, explaining and playing through a series of dungeons, this is an excellent quicker alternative! Its head to head, sets up much quicker and is easier to teach. Just select your heros, look at the shots guide and you're good to go. It also scales extremely well at 2 to 8 players. You could even have drop in/drop out play.

First time I've felt the need to write a rating on BGG- this has become me and my wife's favourite boardgame!  Very easy to pick up and play, its extremely fun with quick set-ups and swift matches.  There is a low-medium level of strategy involved, but the focus is on fast paced dexterous gameplay. Definitely not too time consuming and overbearing to feel like you have to exert your mental strength.  Definitely a relaxing game to unwind after a long day!

Great game! Elzra managed to take the fun of Catacombs and condense it into a smaller battlefield, with less components, and faster/easier setup. You can still play in 1vsMany mode but the coolest part is being able to pay a mostly symmetric team vs team mode. The abilities are interesting and strategic. So far, all of the characters seem useful. And I love the health management approach in team vs team. A team has a health pool, which means no player/character elimination.

This is a fun partygame! We had a really good time with it including mean trash talk and embarassing misses. Our second game ended in a strange stalemate with many discs neighbouring each other in one corner of the board though - this led to a very anticlimatic ending of the game and I really hope that this was an exception!

Excellent little dexterity skirmish game in a similar vein to Flick 'Em Up. The board here defines play and there's some great terrain bits that can be moved around. The heroes abilities charging via successful shots also ties wonderfully to the escalation of play as the tempo rises and falls with large abilities springing.

I prefer Catacombs proper, but this is a nice short diversion that's worth getting out.

Based on 1 play with 5 players:

Not totally sure how to feel about this one yet. It's certainly streamlined. It seems like a fun quick tactical combat flicking game, but the experience is much shallower compared to its elder sibling. I miss the campaign feel & progression more than I would have expected.

Nachdem Bernhard sich durch die anscheinend schlechte Regel durchgekämpft hatte, konnte es nach ca 30 Minuten dann auch mal mit dem Schnippen losgehen. An sich ist die Idee allen Chips/Charakteren verschiedene Fähigkeiten beim Schnippen zu geben nett. Aber an der Stelle iwie überladen. Das hat dann auch Regelfragen aufgeworfen. Ich bevorzuge hier ein schnelles Ice Cool.

I need to get some more plays of this in, but so far I'm liking the quicker gameplay, and better balance (vs plain Catacombs), and for some reason I love the chunky obstacles. As in basic Catacombs 3rd edition, I still love the art and the dexterity based combat just feels so right. The special powers which charge up seem kind of like they just end the game after just a couple fire. That might be the point, but it feels a little weird, and I could easily see games where it's just whoever gets the super power first wins. Of course you could play with more health, but I'm talking standard rules. My one other concern is how closely the teams seem to mirror each other, and perhaps slightly too few options in the base game... But I'm sure some of that will be alleviated by the expansions, which I have, but I'm concerned for people who might not have the expansions.

Love this game. I bought it because I like the fact it's different. And you need to build your skill. And what fun it is! I think I like this one more than Catacombs 3rd edition. I bought that game also, and still have to try it, but the competitive mode of Catacombs & Castles is really fun. 

Another thing is that it's easy to learn and all the information is on the cards. And the obstacles makes it even more challenging. A whole new experience walking around the table to get the best shot. Sometimes it goes so fast, you can't even see what happend. Very good and fun game.

45 minutes of rules, one false start, and 10 minutes of actual gameplay later, most of us were lukewarm about the experience. This Catacombs system fixes issues with the original version of Catacombs, but not substantially enough for most of us to want to play again. It's a tabletop wargame with flicking, and an extremely fiddly card-power based character system overlay that pads the gameplay time. 90% of the game is spent watching people look at the game. Even for flicking game/dexterity mavens there are probably better options.

The [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameartist/28024/kwanchai-moriya]Fantastically whimsical illustrations by Kwanchai Moriya[/url] tie the mechanisms of this ridiculous finger flicking fest together with the theme perfectly.

:thumbsup: shorter playtime than Catacombs

I'm biased towards liking dexterity games due to being adept at them. They are generally focused around uncontestable-skills, making them fun for those that excel, and not for those that don't. No matter how good your strategy and/or tactics, you will not win if you can't aim and flick a disc well.

Same excellent mechanics, and a shorter playtime make this version a better fit for me.

First dexterity game and only played it once.  Clips for the barrier walls were a pain to insert and the rule book could've been better.  I didn't find the game to be complex at all and I don't think teaching it would be difficult.  Other than the clips, the components are all top notch.  

I'm not sure how I feel about the dexterity genre (I assume this is a good game to measure the genre by).  Maybe more plays will help me iron those feelings out.

-See Catacombs
-Quick to set-up and play

[b]Dislike:[/b]
-Ability cards

Lots of shared positives with regular Catacombs. Castles in addition sets-up really fast. However I'd recommend Catacombs over Castles anytime, as it miraculously has some problem.

Let's start with the minor problem: it's not as straightforward to explain. This is due to the fact that every hero has a unique shot not found on the others, so you'll have to do more than just explaining the simple rush, melee and ranged shots. If you're playing with the ability cards, it only gets worse.

Which brings me to the main problem with this game: yes, the ability cards. They all feel very strong, and I'd preffered it if they just gave minor one time buffs like a rush shot before your standard sequence. Instead, when you use one, you go from your normal 1 damage to a whoopin' 3-6 damage. "But you just have to play so they aren't able to do that!" Sure, you could say that, but I think it would be better if the game didn't revolve around these ability cards.

In boss mode these just get insane, since they are one time free of use. If you picked the right combination, you can easily kill him in one go, or if you're really bad at flicking, inflict half damage.

The only time I would play Castle before Catacombs is if I don't have a lot of time.

I would rather play Catacombs 3rd Edition - but this is also interesting, takes less space, and plays faster. Characters have more complex shot sequences, and winning/losing as a team instead of individual characters is a nice change.

Falls just short of a top rating from me. It's fun, and there is a huge amount of replay value, but I miss the story woven during a session of Catacombs 3rd Edition.

(Note: We haven't played the boss battles at all yet, so can't comment on that mode.)

Mostly, I found it too long for what it is.  It's fun to flick disks at each other with special powers, but I don't think games finish in 30 minutes (at least not with the expansions, which tend to slow things down).  It's neat at first, but it quickly gets repetitive.

As a kind-of-expansion for Catabombs, this is not well balanced -- the designer admits that the heroes are overpowered, and fans seem to agree.  Too bad, since that would have made it worthwhile.

Catacombs & Castles is an excellent trimming-down of the best dexterity game out there. I prefer the chunkier version, but fans of flicking will find plenty of good reasons to sprain their interphalangeal joints in this box.

This is a superb fast-paced and exciting dexterity game. It's a bit more complicated than Flick-em-up but makes up for that in depth and replayability. There are lots of choices of heroes and ways to play. The components and art are top quality, there's even a set of barriers to prevent the endless hunting for counters that happens when you get a bit carried away. It's an amazing system that every fan of disc flicking dexterity games should take a look at.

Wow, I have never played Catacombs, but I never imagined that I could like a flicking game this much. Most other games of this type either offer little else besides flicking, suffer from too many rules or outstay their welcome in terms of playing time. Not this game: the rules are easy to remember after a few turns, there certainly is room for strategic decisions (in combining the different character skills), and the length of the (team) game is just perfect with 8 hitpoints. Looking forward to my next play!

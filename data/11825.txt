This is an incredible game!  Although [thing=38996][/thing] is my favorite game, this is probably [person=152]Mark Herman's[/person] masterpiece.

It is elegant, thought-provoking, and deep.  It's unlike any other card driven game out there.  About all that it has in common others are the cards having events and OPS (Gee, isn't that what makes it a CDG?).  What I mean is that you see similarities in them: spend OPS point to activate a general, lay down attack/movement markers and such, but this one has absolutely nothing in common with those in terms of game play, and that is a great thing.  Mark Herman went out and re-invented the CDG all over again.

It uses the core system you see in many Pacific strategy games, namely the move/react/battle/redeploy feature along with coordinating air units/infantry/naval units/marines, along with Japanese capturing resources in Burma, Philippines, and the Dutch East Indies along with rules for taking out India, China, and Australia, while feeling the effects of Europe. 

But let me put it this way, while I dearly love [thing=20609][/thing], AE is Bruce Banner.  When Bruce gets angry, he turns into Empire of the Sun: a super sized behemoth of awesomeness that will make you soil your drawers the moment you stand face to face with it and realize just how big and awesome it truly is.

In addition to the core game that is in in so many different packages, in this one you suffer from your bickering polticially-driven commanders through a unique inter-service rivalry aspect, this one differs by abstracting the internal revolution in India and the Sino-Japanese war, because Mark Herman explains that Japan was biting off more than it could chew through a land grab, but instead, tried to destabilize the governments of those two countries.
 
The game uses layers of operational realism and historical detail, and the end result is the PTO game that all others are measured against.  Every operation/move takes so much planning that you feel like Nimitz and Yamamoto.

This is not a game for the feint of heart.  This is not one that you and your buddy are going to read through the instructions once and sit down and "figure it out together."  If you try, you WILL screw up stuff that, in turn, screws up the game.  If you insist on trying this, go to the Files section and download the two player aids that I created to help new players run an operation and correct common newbie errors.  

But if you can't find an experienced player, send me a Geekmail with your e-mail address in it.  I have created a series of 25 Vassal modules that teach you the game, some basic strategies, and provide some small examples of play.  Combined with my player aids, if you are diligent, you can play error-free, and discover perhaps the greatest CDG ever made.

Sistema en solitario para cartas mio.
Buena adaptación de Mark Herman de un CDG a hexágonos.
Bastante complicado para controlar todas las mecánicas y excepciones del juego.
El sistema en solitario que se ofrece en la 2ª edición es casi imposible de utilizar por complejo y muy incompleto (a ver la reforma de los bots que promete el autor...)
Refleja bien la dinámica de la Guerra en el Pacífico.
Quizá exceso de cálculo para sumar en los combates.

A great game that really gives you a feel for the situations of the Japanese and the Allies at the onset of the Pacific War, and then as it progressed. Maybe not entirely historically accurate in terms of spreading forces around, but a great game with a lot of hard choices. Especially as the Japanese, you can never do as much as you want. It takes a while to learn the basic rules, and all the fiddly little subsystems (like National Surrender, Special Reactions, China/Burma, etc.) can still catch you even after several plays. Also, like many CDGs, favors experienced players who know the cards. But a very good game, becoming one of my favorites.

RATING: 9
An excellent, strategic level treatment of the Pacific Theater during WWII.  It factors in so many aspects of that part of the conflict:  China, Burma, India, Commonwealth forces, strategic bombing of Japan, importance of air power and the growing strength of US airpower during the conflict, US political pressure to make progress in the war, and on and on.

I have the 2nd edition, from GMT games, and the components are beautiful.  A beautifully detailed, mounted mapboard by Mark Simonitch, solid, thick counters, high quality cards and 2 10-sided dice, color coded for US and Japan.  Additionally, it comes with heavy cardstock player aids and bot directions for playing solo.  I just love the quality of everything in the box, including the box itself, which is sturdy, holds everything and whose cover art inspires me to play the game each time I look at it.

This game uses Mark Herman's famous CDG mechanic and I think it works very well here.  The rulebook is clear and well laid out.  I have sometimes struggled with rulebooks from other of Mark's games, but this one is not a problem.

It is a long game, particularly if you want to play the full campaign game.  It is an ideal Vassal/email game as a campaign game.  But it also comes with very enjoyable scenarios that can be played in a single sitting (5 or so hours, in my experience).  The length of play, of course, will depend much on the player's experience with the game.  I imagine my own playtime will reduce as I gain further experience with it.

For me, this is THE game to have if you are looking for a comprehensive Pacific War wargame.

Un juego espectacular.

Eso sí, no es para todos los públicos. Las reglas no son fáciles ni intuitivas y tienen sutilezas estratégicas que han de ser despejadas a base de partidas. La comprensión del mapa lleva su tiempo. Qué sitios son importantes y hay que proteger, longitudes de activación, ZOI, donde golpear, cuando y con cuantas tropas. El combate siempre es una incertidumbre y es imposible tenerlo todo bajo control. Incluso el final de la partida no es obvio pq las posibilidades de victoria son múltiples (¿recursos?, ¿Japón?, ¿aislamiento?).

Mantiene la tensión desde la primera carta a la última. Es muy típico llegar al último turno sin un ganador claro y con todo por decidir. He ganado y perdido con una de las últimas cartas de la partida después de un montón de horas de juego. Increíble.

El jugador americano debe ser muy meticuloso en sus ofensivas hasta lograr la supremacía aeronaval. Por su parte el japonés debe jugar bien sus oportunidades iniciales pq a largo plazo se impondrá la superioridad material de los aliados. Ambos bandos tienen su fase ofensiva y defensiva a lo largo de la partida y hay que saber muy bien como ir progresando de una a otra a lo largo de ella.

Novatos, huir. Es un juego para verdaderos grognards.

This is a very difficult game for me to rate. On the plus side the system is brilliant, it limits the ability to conduct unreal operations and gives results that resemble real operations. On the down side is the difficulty I have had learning the rules and sometimes remembering what are the places some units can move and sites that need to  be captured to conquest a territory. The map could have been more helpfull here. Also the game is in need of a very detailed turn sequence chart like the one that came out in boardgamegeek for fire in the sky.
after repeated plays the system grows on me. I increased its rating

Initial Impression: The 2nd edition definitely has a deluxe treatment feel to me, with the inclusion of a mounted board and thick cardboard counters. This game has an interesting take on the Pacific theater, opting to focus on political as well instead of just military. The game melds a number of concepts seen in other games but the resulting flavor tastes extraordinarily unique. HQ activations, supply lines, air ZOCs (ZOIs), mixed with card driven historical events. Although objectives are straightforward, how to accomplish them are anything but. My one complaint, at least for now, is the amount of chrome and exceptions included with the game, particularly when referring to the Burma/China/India quarter of the map. I suppose that given more plays these rules will become second nature but for now they boggle the mind. There's certainly alot of meat in this game and I feel it'll take many fun-filled sessions in order to even just become proficient, much less master it.

This is probably the ultimate strategic Pacific War game treatment. Each card choice is tense, the number of options for both players is staggering.

One day I believe that the US is favored, the next I think it is the Japanese. Each time I play I learn a new twist. This is a very deep, complex in terms of strategies, a bit daunting at first but not that much once you have figured out the mechanics. It is well worth the investment in effort to learn.

The campaign can be done is a long day between experienced players.

This is a gem in my collection. I revised the rating up.

Nice componenets, and a great idea that, for me, simply does not work well. Too many abstractions that make you go "Huh?". Like the ability of surface anval units to destroy armies in Burma. Or the way that the Allies are encouraged to engage in "throw-away" attacks due to the replacements system. I could go on, but over all, my conclusion s that if you don't know anything about the war in the pacific during WW2, this *might* interest you. Otherwise...

RATING: 8
The best war game I have played since getting back into the hobby three years ago. Talk about "managing risk in an uncertain environment"!

1/1/13 UPDATE: Originally rated a 9.5, but now I have cooled a bit on CDG's that segment play (many times it seems inorganically to the conflict being simulated) by using a poker-style "hand" management type mechanic. Also, the '43 Scenario can be very susceptible to luck of the draw with the cards. Probably shines best if the full campaign is played, but that is a big time commitment.

RATING: 9
Probably the best all around war game I have played since getting back into the hobby around 2007. A bit of a steep learning curve and also, I think the full campaign is the way to go as the one year scenarios are too susceptible to luck-of-the-draw. The way that the conflict's historial dynamics are highlighted, the deep game play and the replayability are just too impressive to rate this any lower.

After 1.4 ruleset- Herman creates a good system based around the operation concept. Cards are no more ops, but the major offensives that we see at strategic level. The game is quite steep to learn, as the hq placement is vital to carry on the attacks, and as is very important the air umbrella to realize everything. Players need to study very well the map and have a strategic plan in mind. This is the game less suited for a casual player, but a devoted one will have hours of great fun.
My main concern is about the dramatic impact dieroll can have. Japanese must think very well before to engage the irreplaceble carrier fleet, but is it true that often carriers are necessary to carry on invasions.

Very nice counters and map, and has the innovation of using the CDG module on a hex-based map.  However, the Rulebook has gone over several revisions since the update, and the game has a steep learning curve.  The Political Will device (which works well in For The People) seems a little forced here.  And the fact that Germany can win the game for the Axis in a Pacific Theater game is a little odd.

RATING: 7.1
Oct 2017 update -- more reading the history and more play bring into higher relief the seeming inaccuracy of several game facets; sea task force ninja penetration vs. LBA umbrellas, the phenomena of two Jap WIE cardplays in 1942 having a decent chance to slow Allied reinforcements (harmful), but more so, freeze Allied Amphibious Shipping Pt buildup (absolutely crippling), and, hence, leave 0 margin for error on the the "take X hexes back" National Will requirement from T4 on; and really sinking in this time around, the irritation of single Mega decks vs. what would be a natural Early War 41-42 vs. Later War 43+ split deck decision.  

And, on the visuals note, some lost opportunity on US air counters; USMC gets what appears to be a Wildcat or two; that's okay, yet Corsairs would have been more appropriate.  But in what I consider a major blunder, given we see plenty of Jap zeroes (or Oscars?), we see not one P-38 Lightning icon, which was considered the hallmark US aircraft of the Pacific theater war.  Lots of Lt and Med bombers, but not one fork tail fighter.  A shame.   Dropped rating a pt on all these late-realized facets. 
 
Involved, but solid, and the complexity is understandable given the subject matter.  I enjoyed the simulation, and historicity.  Gamewise, it's a fun 3 turns for the Japanese, then a long descent into a pacific root canal.  On the last 2-3 turns, it doesn't seem to pay for the Japs to even move anyone.

This is a strategic game where positioning and long term views reign.  The initial play of the campaign scenario is always a bit tricky as a few bad rolls by either side can make the game much more challenging, and some of the abstractions, such as War in Europe or Progress of War can make things almost impossible to deal with if the cards don't come out right, but it works and is very, very exciting.

I found that watching the CSW challenge match was extremely useful in helping me understand the intricacies of the rules, the general strategy and improving the overall enjoyment of the game.

As you read through the replay you get a full sense of the nail-biting aspect as it brings the best and the worst out in the players.  Kudos to Mark Herman for putting together this gem and supporting it in such a professional manner.

The rules look tricky and long, but once the game begins, they actually are fairly straight forward.  I missed several points in my play, but I understand them all now.  Most of the misses was because I chose to overlook some items until I could get into the flow of it.

Clearly not for those who want to play WitP or a Pacific scenario of WiF or AWAW...  This one removes the leader in the field viewpoint.  Very enjoyable - now I need to have someone to play with face to face....

Own, but have not played yet. 2/2009.  I FINALLY leanred this game and, I must say, I enjoy the design immensely.  This has finally filled the void of a good strategic game of the Pacific War.  Yes, the victory conditions are difficult for the US player, but that adjustment is necessary, IMO and does not detract from game play.  The activating of units and HQ units makes for a good tense game.  Another winner from Mark Herman! :thumbsup:

RATING: 3
UPDATE for 2.0: The 2.0 rules set are a big improvement. A lot of gamey stuff (like the notorious gaming of the US PW track) has been stricken, and things have been cleaned up. 2.0 plays better, and for a while I had almost made my peace with EotS and was almost willing to upgrade my rating.

Unfortunately, the War in Europe track still doesn't work - the fall of those cards can decide the game, in fact has decided the game in virtually every game I've played. Under the old rules, it could take critical forces away permanently. Thankfully this is no longer the case, but the Japanese still have a huge edge in terms of pumping up that track, and if they manage to max it out, forget it. There is nothing the US can do but draw the right cards. Also, I'm not enamored of how easy it is for the US and Commonwealth to supply unrealistically high force levels in remote locations, and I also dislike the ease with which air perimeters can be breached - large task forces can sail right through curtains of LBA without hinderance. I also dislike the huge draw decks, which create significant sequencing problems, and I'm not sure what it represents when, say, Japan draws all their Kamikaze cards in 1942. Ground units seem unrealistically vulnerable to random air and naval attacks. And there are bizarre pinning tactics using US LRBs that make for what seems like very unrealistic play.

Anyway, like For the People, you have to buy in to, or at least make peace with, Empire of the Sun's oddities before you can like it. I almost made it. But I didn't. It's all a shame because I love all the event cards. I want to play this game just to get at the cool decks of cards (although why it wasn't broken down into "early" and "late" halves as in PoG, I don't know) - the events and the operations are all great. But the surrounding game seems suspect on many levels.

Last thing - even in version 2.0, the rulebook for this thing is a flaming car wreck, making the game vastly more complicated than it needs to be. And why oh why is there no index? If you have a rule question, you need to guess as to where it might be, and your guess is most likely wrong.

The reverence this game is held in by a hard core of fans is to me a mystery. There are undeniably clever bits here. But taken as a whole, it's still a strange game.
---
Promising. But to be fair, there are a lot of problems here too (http://homepage.mac.com/c_farrell/iblog/C1070818615/E1669858403/index.html). As shipped, it feels about half done. There is some seriously odd stuff going on here: deep penetration raids going through massive air umbrellas with no real hinderance, a very odd combat resolution system which has poor-quality brigades holding up armies for months and months (shades of the bizzare CRT in For the People), and large sections of the rules being almost incoherent. The victory condition are very odd - the Allies have to either invade Japan, or meet three conditions (strat bombing, taking resource hexes, and having a B-29 in range of Tokyo), but two of these are dictated virtually 100% by pure luck! What's the deal with that? The huge card decks - you are virtually guarenteed to not see every card - don't work as well as one might hope, it seems too lucky.

Despite all this, though, the game still has the potenetial to be cool and I still would like to play some more. The core offensives system is pretty good, I like the intelligence condition stuff, and the cards themselves are rather interesting. We'll see if the stuff that seems awkward really is, or if it's just something you've got to power through (like that CRT in For the People). The rules and player aids are awful, though, and that's a major problem.

Very interesting.  Lot's of options to consider.  Looks good also, especially the map.  Takes a while to absorb the rules.  Actually the rules are unnecessarily complex and could be better written, but hey.  I tried hard to like this game, but ultimately didn't.  I'd have to mod it too heavily to make it the game I'd like it to be.  Axis and Allies: Pacific actually seems more historical to me. Maybe the new version is better; I don't know.

I have twice tried playing this and helped play it a third time.  The game's rules are poorly writen making a complex game all that more difficult.  The designer uses headquarters & supplies from them with a michanic which I would argue is overly burdonsome.

Brillant design, poor execution. Mr. Herman give some very good food for thought for the CDG enthusists. It's a pity that this game has so many little upsetting producing and proofreading and playtesting nuances. It detracts from gaming enjoyment. The rules are a nightmare, convoluted, contradicting themselves, no decent player aids were included. The game is a positional one (you need to take the important locations) with some very bloody and luck oriented dice feast battles. The victory conditions are horrible with the Allies losing their games to political will in the first turns and to the weird victory conditions to the end. Very skillfull play can reduce the amount of luck in this game but the learning curve is really too steep in order for the allied player to catch up. The War in Europe effect is nice but completely luck oriented and can ruin completely a game for the Allies. 
The game is not short either which make me wonder if many people will devoid to this game the huge amount of time needed in order to get skillfull enough to _reduce_ the role of lady luck. 
I played 6 games but I found no urge to play more short of a major rework of the rules and victory conditions.
19th june 2005 version 1.3 of the rules comes out. 
I found a major annojance shelling 75 bucks for an half done game. 
One year after my first games I pick up rule version 1.4, find a completely rewritten political will section, a very different victory points system and some other changes. After two more games I subscribe what I wrote in 2005, this game is too complex for the dice feast it really is. Perfect openings and "must" moves are the norm and you don't really have control over the event. The players must obey to the script written by designer, otherwise something bad is going to happen ... a pity since I really wanted to like this one.

GMT Games.  Really solid WWII Pacific Theater war game.  Empire of the Sun is well designed and is an involved war game.  A full game can take a very long day to play.  Beautiful game pieces and map.  Combat system works very well.  Two player game where it can be a good, tense battle if players have reasonably equal skill at game play and familiarity with the game.

If you want to experience what it would be like to be "top brass" commanding the Pacific in WWII, this is THE game for you. I'd have rated a 10 if not for the 12-plus hour play time needed (shorter variants are available if you don't want to fight the whole war). This game is brilliantly done, takes the highest level of skill imaginable for a war game, and has exceptionally high replay value due to the many events, tracks, and ever-risky battles.

I had a hard time with this one. The rules were tough sledding for me and there was a high "what do I do now?" factor. Much of this, I'm sure, to do with the novel mechanics. Still, this designer always provides great depth of play, as well as a lot of thought and research, in every game, so I plan to return to it one day.

Struggled through a couple of solo games.  Tons of rules checks and re-checks led me to assume I just wasn't "getting it".

I'm sure it will make some happy, but I'll go on hugging Pacific Victory for now.

This was a really great game when it came out ... but I lost a lot as I played again and again. Combat System was too unforgiving (that 1 and 9 roll could wipe out an overwhelming force). Reaction to minor attacks could be overwhelming, etc. It also became scripted in 42-43 as far as strategy.

22/08/15 re-acquired, now second ed. Despite my reservations over the card driven system and some of the compromises necessary to get a complex war down to one days play, this is a phenomenal game. I haven't played enough (4 games) to comment on balance but this feels like the deep competitive game many people ask for. It is complex but the pay off is there. The game gives you lots of strategic and tactical problems to solve that are easy to relate to the history (for the most part).


13/10/14 = still learning this. The issue is that in one card you may have to conduct combined arms and reaction movement, the whole lot, so its not an easy entry.

However, it is an interesting geographical problem. This is a game about airfield control and spending resources wisely. The japanese are going to romp around the map early, but later the tide will swing the other way. It is a clever design. It is no mean feat to deliver the Pacific War in an afternoon in a workably short ruleset.



-------------------

some what provisional rating. Played one learning game. I can see the potential. Its not the hardest rule set i've read, but possibly the hardest i've played. Im getting my head around it but it will take a few games before i really have a solid grasp. Sent lots of carriers unsupported to their doom.

A great game that I enjoyed a lot. Haven't seen any games yet that handle the PTO better. I even might give this a higher ranking but I do feel that they should have included a early war and a late war deck. I'm no expert in this game but I do have the feeling that if you draw miserable in the early phase of the war... you can be screwed. Japan needs to expand fast and if you only get some low OPS value cards (like kamikaze) Well... those cards are pretty worthless at that moment. I didn't happen in my game but I do feel the risk is there.

PTO games are tough to design since it's tough to make a game in which the Japanese player has a chance of winning. I think Mark Herman tried too hard here. A game in which the Japanese can win a "political victory" in 1943 is ignoring the historical fundamentals of US political and public will.

After just one play.
I agree that the rules are terrible, but the games is not complex if you have someone explain the rules to you.
Its very deep in strategy from what ive seen and the two parts have to play in a very different way to achieve victory.
The Japanese have to be very careful on what they do, a single big battle lost means going to the defense.
Its better to have a big fleet inactive than not having one at all. (that seems obvious but it isnt)
The focus is slow down the US player and even only the menace of the enemy fleet can slow him down.
The US player has always alot of replacements so loosing a single battle has no effect on him.
Maybe to really hurt the USA, Japan has to dedicate a full turn to grind the enemy fleets.
It seems a very good game.

-your hand can be full of unplayable 1945 events.

There are so many innovative ideas and strategic options in this one that it can be a bit overwhelming at first. 

The hex map and ship counters are kind of deceiving as you tend to think this is an operational game when in fact it 100% strategic and most military operations are completely abstracted into the design. Once you understand the huge spatial and time scale of the game everything clicks in.

The only (big) caveat has to do with the rulebook. Way too verbose and disorganised as it usually happens with Herman's games.

In any case, I'm truly looking forward to playing many games of this one.

I had ALOT of reluctance to diving into EotS; I'm too old to muck about with hexes  And, it just looked too "fiddly" with zones of influence (as it turns out, rather simple) and reaction rules (as it turns out, elegant). BUT, having just been thru the process of learning this one, it won't take you more than a complete campaign game to get the hang of it. 

It's not the rules that are complex; it's the choices presented to the gamer and what to do about them (that's called good game design). The reaction system makes you think about offense and defense in depth - much different to the most wargames. Think picket line and the winner being who can concentrate the most the quickest on the key spot (sounds like war to me - think Stonewall Jackson).

The way politics (Inter Service Rivalry, Progress of War), the secondary fronts (China, Burma, India, etc)  and stuff beyond your control (War in Europe) is modeled is innovative and elegant. I'd place this game in group of games out the last few years that really offer strategy gamers an integrated political and military game.

Having played almost all the Pac war games and concluded, well, they suck (they don't play like the history I read, completely ignore politics, etc) - this one is a gem. Given that it has been out 5 years and has 25,000 (yes thousand) messages on Consim, a "staff" game going on the consim board that you can follow along with, the three podcasts on how to play the game, I can't think of a better supported game.

Anyways, you're really missing one of the top wargames of the last decade, and I think the best Pac War game I've played (been wargaming 30+ years), if you don't pick this one up. It would be like playing WWI games and somehow not giving Paths of Glory a try - or the American Civil War and not giving For the People a go.

This is one fun and frickin smart game.

Played three times, of which a couple were "false starts". The mechanics of Empire of the Sun are really original and the game is flavourful. However the rules are a little too complex and the game too long for what it offers. But the real problem is in playing the Japanese - they have a short time in which to put themselves in a position to win. If they fail through oversight or bad luck, then they spend the rest of the game waiting to see whether the US wins or not.

This is one of the best strategic-level treatments of WWII in the Pacific, I've played.  What most impresses me after a couple of play-throughs is how players must take into account the same things that the historic leaders had to take into account.  Beautiful map, colorful counters, and gorgeous cards make this one one of THE BEST!

RATING: 7.5
Another great CDG from GMT and one of Herman's best designs.  On the heavier side CDGs.  Typical in that you have the choice between events and OPs, but the different types of cards (Resources, Political, Reaction, Offensive) add a lot of flavor.  The action and reaction aspect of the game is very well designed.  The Political Will track will keep the game interesting in the later turns when the Allies are at a huge material advantage.

RATING: 5
 These games are about buying into an illusion, and unfortunately for me,  I find that the EoS illusion doesn't work for me ... Why? some of it is due to the problems the whole PW manipulation thing...some of it is related to the game's abstractions (for example...the ease in which the Jp can sneak in an Army Corps past the American Armadas)...and some  because that I find that I am making decisions for gamey purposes and not for real world strategic reasons. ....Caveat, looks like they have been steadly improving this game, latest version has removed some of the cheesier tactics and made the PW drought easier to overcome.

Have been playing pretty much non-stop since I dusted it off 18 months ago.  The more I play, the more I appreciate it - pretty much my all-time favorite.  Not a light game.  The rules are non-standard, even for a CDG.  And once you learn them, it takes a little practice to have some idea what to do.  Best way to learn is spend some time with the videos and Vassal tutorials available, and then look for a friendly opponent willing to do a teaching game.  You can find those here or at the CSW forum.

Once you understand the rules and how to use them, the game actually plays fairly quickly.  The low counter density means you can put some serious thought into each card as an operational puzzle.  And the cards contribute to amazing replay value.

If you enjoy WW2 in the Pacific, and are willing to invest some time, the return is well worth it. If you are looking for a Pacific game you can get into quickly, or just don't like dealing with unusual game systems, EotS is not it.  Also, if you like the cards in your CDGs to generally re-create the historical script, you won't find that here.  The cards do provide lots of historical flavor, just not a script.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I really really wanted to like EotS. I love Mark Herman's work, and For the Poeple is my favorite wargame, and I am fascinated by the Pacific War. And I really tried. The rules are innovative, and required a lot of work to be assimilated, but I did it. I played the game numerous times, but in the end, I am not convinced. Maybe complexity is the issue, but it is usually not a problem for me. Strange...

Rules Ver 1.3.  The game has some very clever game mechanics, and others that are too odd to be ignored (in addition to those some have mentioned, the fixed-schedule air replacement points for the Allies mean that they're encouraged to use painless kamikaze (!) tactics if they haven't lost their allotment for the year through other combat).  The game was clearly released prematurely, with all the levers in place but not adjusted.  I have trust that the game will eventually work its way to becoming better, as the designer pursues it doggedly and will sometimes improve on any perceived weaknesses.  Hopefully, the rules will continue to improve (and the consistent gross error in the example of play will be corrected), the scenarios will be balanced (were the '42 and '43 scenarios even playtested?), and the misleading map errata in the WiE box will be corrected with a downloadable image file. 2009 Update: it's all in the hands of the few devoted followers now, who swallowed many of the game's enormous problems without complaint.

A masterpiece. This game is probably one of the top 5 CDGs ever released. The rules are complex and one really needs to play this several times to get a basic grasp of strategy.

Awesome board. Normally such games provide thin paper maps that always fold horribly and you need some heavy glass plate to flaten them. Not here: A heavy mounted board! Interesting game mode, card driven, still complex and highly solitary suited. The only problem: It is really a very long game and I doubt it will come up more than once every five years on the game table if I think about my gaming friends. The game system has many fiddly rules... even though I adore this complex system and the historical correctness I prefer faster systems like Triumph & Tragedy (also GMT, also a game that covers the whole war, European Theater).

RATING: 10
This game is surely the one to watch in 2005. It is going to be a great game from Mark Herman.  With Card-driven game mechanics, one gorgeous map and competitive tournament-type scenarios, this one is definitely the best strategic-operational level game on the Pacific theatre. Achievement of perfection requires judgement as well as enthusiasm.  This game has both. 

Lots of decisions to make and everytime you are making an important one.  The uncertain aspects of political events are seamlessly and subtely integrated in the core game mechanics (via political will track, not political control marker this time).  

The game emphasis on the use of Operation Cards and Event Cards to conduct offensives. The game system is very interactive and fluid in that reaction player has every chance to react a number of units, within the range of a Headquarter, quickly to a battle location. So you'll see units triggering to move at any time and developing small into a large bloody battle. Very realistic as to what was fought over. 

Air units' Zone of Influence (ZOI) is another interesting concept not so often seen before. The ZOI could prohibit amphibious assault, strategic movement and tracing line of communication. The air force is given its credit where it's due. 

Movement allowance is dependent on the use of cards as its value is a multiplier to the basic movement rate by unit types. Weather is a card in your hand of fate.... Intelligence war is simulated elegantly. Every battle is a surprise attack unless modified by a reaction card or a die roll. If successful, the war is turned into an intercept or ambush. The determination of intelligence state has a direct proportion to the amount of inflict of losses. Combat losses calculation requires a several add-ups.  So you need you calculator handy.  Part of the fun in this game is to apply hits to your opponent.  An interesting aspect therefore is to plan your offensive with combined arms and screening forces, so that you won't have to incur a big loss in one battle alone.    

The rules are well written, sometimes too lengthy or duplicate, but the game concepts are clearly explained as a result.  The offensive action and reaction movements are sometimes criss-crossing each other in the context of amphibious assaults.  So you have to read carefully about the movement and combat things. Once you passed the action and reaction moves, amphibious assault and command range rules, everything would start making more sense. The game system is really designed with an objective to capture the unique features of island-jumping land and sea campaigns. The one map is gorgeous to cover the entire Pacific War, divided into several theatres of operations except China. CBI, Philippines, Southeast Asia, Dutch Indies, Australia, Marshall and other small Pacific islands, Japan homeland…no arbitrary army restriction lines but just that the game flows naturally along the historical line of the Japanese naval and land invasions. The geography of the Pacific dictates the strategies and tactics. 

Victory is ultimately hanging on the Japan's ability to bring the Allies into a peace talk.  Great gaming system and replay value.  This game is designed to be playable one mapper game and completed in one session than Mark's longer, if not unplayable, game on the same theatre - Pacific War (VG).  

Everything you look for in a wargame, and especially card-driven ones (it is the first time to integrate CDG to a traditional hex based map), are here in this one package.  Excellent physical components, the cards art, the counters' choice of colors, the map's richness and strategic overall commander feel, all that are just some of the goodies in a highly integrated gaming system.  If you just want only one game in 2005, grab this!

I had been really looking forward to this.  For one, it's nice to see an CDG that avoids the awkward and ugly sticks-and-boxes maps that most of them have.  Unfortunately it turned out to be a very mixed bag.  Some aspects (e.g., the air interaction) are a thing of beauty, some others (selection of battle hexes and their effects) are both extremely intricate and have led to much misinterpretation but also lead to gamey strategies.  Card play largely avoids the strange supply vs politics dichotomy of other CDGs, but when it shows up (War in Europe cards) it does so with a vengeance.  As it is, most cards instead have a supply vs supply dichotomy instead (lots of specialised activity vs less but more flexible activity), but this feels a bit alt-hist as it's not tied into the background flow that made the different choices possible.  Suspect an early/late war split would have felt more like the historical war.  Overall, fun game if you can stomach the gameyness; I couldn't.  The game forces you to spend time on planning out inaccurate details.  The rule that allows a single step of bombers to reliably pin an entire fleet in place leads to historically absurd unit placement at the highest level.  ABDA HQ will almost never be formed and it better not be, otherwise the Netherlands East Indies will be unconquerable by the historical timeline.  And so on...

After thinking about it for some time, it's clear that this won't go back on the table.  Dropped by one rank.

why 8,5 and not 9 for this masterpiece?

Beacuse despite and great system and excellent components game history in the early part is poor. To create anything like the the historical japanese advance especiale in the NEI you have to pull the right  cards in the right sequence. The game rest on the japanese creating their defence perimeter quickly, if they don't do that... to be quite honest the centrifugal offensive is a really tricky topic. Some designers even suggest to start in 1942 with the japanese already in place (Pacific Fleet for example) or like here they use a 1942 start for a reduced campaign game, but in this case the 1942 is only skippng the rather scripted 1st turn and not starting with the Japanese perimeter in place. Japanese card draw in GT2 and GT3 can spoil the game.

Personally I have also a problem with the games scale and the need to think in strategic rather than operation terms for naval operations, but this is just me.

Interesting take on the conflict from a genuinely thought through and intelligent strategic perspective.  I have started quite a few games on VASSAL, but never managed to get through one.

Pre-ordered the third printing (which is the second printing of the second edition) for three reasons:  different colours for Navy and Army units for both sides (to make Inter-service Rivalry easier to remember and apply); mounted map; and a solo bot (Erasmus) which will be into its second edition in this third printing.  That alone should mean this amazing game gets played more.

With the Allied player playing Inter-Service Rivalry at the start of the 1942-43 mini-campaign, and the Japanese player not drawing a counter, it was a decisive Allied win by the end of 1942 with the Japanese going backwards. ISR is mega-powerful, and makes the game almost broken.

Looks like a little more work than I want to put in to play a game,  but I'm a sucker for the subject, and also for Herman's designs. Don't buy it thinking it's an operational carrier game, it's definitely on the high strategic level. Update: just received this, but no play time yet. The map,counters,and cards are really beautiful. The rulebook doesn't seem as bad to me as it does to Chris F., but it's definitely from the same school as For the People's rulebook. The game is complex,and even more than it seems, since there's so much to do every turn. Hope to solitaire this weekend.

Edit: I really want to like this, I have raised my rating after a few recent tries at it. It really has some brilliant ideas, and it may even be brilliant, but it's a game in which I'd really like to have the designer show me how to play :) Still some very confusing concepts, partly because the design is pretty original. Strategy is wide open and mind bogglingly complex...

Summary: a genius design that, like many other CDGs, will work for some and not work for others. It makes my head hurt, and I can only imagine how difficult it was to design. I will have the new reprint soon, and I am determined to dive into it and really learn the system, rather than clumsily stumbling through it as I have done to this point. 

Edit: have received 2nd edition, have it set up on my table now. It's a real beauty, of a kind of GMT's recent reissue of For the People. I really appreciate the new color schemes for Navy/ Army units for both sides - it makes it easier to see at a glance what is what, and the game is even more colorful than it was before.

Finally, the Magnum Opus of Mark Harman's designs. The rules were quite intimidating, to be sure, but JeroenD had played a bit solo so he could clear it up for me. We played the 1942 scenario, and I was the US, which did not leave me much to do except lose badly. Worst die rolling I may ever have done: only one real success. JeroenD nailed about every roll, and his cards gave me bad weather, sunk my ships, and knocked down my planes. Total destruction. Despite all this, the game seems pretty good. I would prefer to play a longer scenario starting early or the 1943 scenario because I would have more to do than desperately try to hold something, anything. In the end, stopped during the second turn: yes, the game went pretty slow. I know very little about the theater and my goals not always too clear to me. Still, very much want to try again.

Dedication is required as the rulebook is not an easy read and the situation that confronts you at the beginning of the game is complex. It's not a particularly difficult set of rules, just quite a lot to get your head around and you do need to know everything at the beginning of the game.

It's a crunchy game with a lot of tough calls to make. The scope is strategic but there is good detail a bit lower down at the 'demi-operational' level. You have got to get your planning right. 

I'm not entirely convinced about the winning conditions for the Allies. Finish the invasion of Japan a year ahead of schedule (a plan obviated by the bomb) or knock out all of those resource locations by August 45(which did not occur either). Not sure exactly what is being said with these conditions.

Mark Herman fiendishly twist of his own CDG format, EotS is a long ride in the hell of Pacific with a steep lerning curve (before) and a stomach-crunch decision-making game (after), the very apex of the tension - what am I going to risk? how much can I hold on as a Japanese player?

Production is stellar (one of the finest hex maps ever), the gameplay - [i]once digested, not going to happen very soon[/i] - is very fluid and tense, the gaming hours run (almost!) without noticing. Counting hexes radius is a bit tedious: Vassal helps a lot here.

A WW2 Pacific classic.

I'll advice to try the short scenarios before playing the campaign, if you don't want to see your offensives ending in full disaster.

一个近乎伟大的游戏。本作对于战略的模拟很到位，但是细节方面玩家就不要纠结了，比如算子数据，我觉得设计师更多的是从游戏角度来给数据的。这个游戏的年份剧本比完整剧本好玩多了，完整剧本总是会有赌牌的成分，比如万事俱备只欠东条。整体上是一个很值得尝试的游戏。

Excellent game. Deep simulation. You have to spend a lot of time planning, while also being pressed to react to your opponent moves.
Clever CRT: you have to set your priorities, and gathering some random units to beef up your attack will usually be useless.

Excellent game, though it can appear more complicated than it is and seem intimidating.  I recommend starting with the game Plan Orange as an introduction to the system, the combat and movement system is the same without having to worry about extraneous theaters like the CBI and how it relates to China, etc.  In Plan Orange, there's the enemy, kill them.

If you're a fan of the designer I think this game is worth a look. For myself, although I really wanted to like it, I found it a frustrating experience to play. IMHO the rules are not easy to understand and the victory conditions/scenarios need some more development. I kept ending up in games where one side (eg Japanese in 1942) were screwed due to picking up an unusual combination of cards. No doubt an expert would tell me that that was due to my bad play, but I'd had enough after six games. I need some cooling-off time before I try this one again!!

RATING: 6
A wargamer's game.  The Pacific War is probably one of the most difficult to simulate topic of all time.  The system is innovative and captures the strategic feel of the war. The yearly scenarios are probably the best place to begin.  Starting with the full campaign in 1941, has created a lot of churning at CSW.  

Some difficulties with the Political Will (PW) scheme in the campaign game will make it more frustrating. If the Japanese player gets the Allied PW to zero, game over.  PW is subject to extremes in card drawing luck (+2 or -3 of effectively 5 points depending on the order of 4 card draws in a deck of 163 cards).  If the Japanese player draws the right two cards before the Allies, he needs only two other actions (invasion of Midway or Alaska or US war progress failure or excessive losses) to win.  

As a historical model the game suffers.  Mark Herman was trying to put commanders into their vision of the war and avoid having the war being a race to drop the bomb.  Unfortunately, the pace of the war in the game is wrong.  The war was fought in the Solomons and southern island chains from Summer of 42 to  Spring of 44.  The Philippines were invaded in Fall and Winter of 44.  Maintain this pace as the Allies and you will lose the game.

Specific rules are also historically annoying.  Marine Air Wings are able to fly two hexes, fight, and return two hexes but cannot stage four hexes.  The replaceable Army of Korea is rated significantly better on defense than any other unit in the game based on its "armor contingent" but the fact that its replaceable ignores the small capability of the Japanese armor industry.  All bases and islands are the same size and can hold a-historical sized ground units and fleets.  The ability of a land unit to react and relocate to the invasion target of an operation at the same speed as a fleet creates some strange approaches to invasions and ignores the heavy recon that preceded island invasions.

Horrible rules and quirky game play, dominated by a card system that makes for a bizarre game experience that does not match the nice production values.  If any game screamed out for point to point movement it's this one - hexes sound nice but all you end up with is terrible congestion in CBI and vast wasted areas in the Pacific.  The ship counters are ugly - great big ship counters have a War At Sea silouhette (c.1975) and generic name ala' SPI.  C'mon: Kongo1 and Kongo2?  These ships HAVE names, you know.  The counter mix is too small for the Japanese to cover their historical advances (our last game saw the allied invasion of the Phillipines - in 1st quarter of 1943!).  The persistant British fleet is completely unhistorical.  Some of the operation names felt made-up.  This game could work, but the cards need heavy editing not only by number (you could get rid of 1/3 of each deck and never notice) but into war period as well.  I'm almost sorry Paths of Glory was so good - it set a bar too high for any other game to match.  UPDATE - After three full campaign games, the Japanese won all three.  Both players felt like they were fighting the system and not their opponent.

I played a test version of the game before it came out.  It may have become a great game, but I'm so off the CDG mechanic in general I'm afraid I was not the ideal audience.  I also felt the game I played over emphasized the importance (and power) of battleships.

A hex and CDG of the Pacific War with the main action being between the US and Japanese fleets. As the Japanese had no historical chance of winning the Allies need to win by August 1945 and the Japanese win if they can delay their fate. Strangely the Japanese win quite often as you can concentrate their carrier fleets and knock out the British and American fleets in turn in 1942 before their increasingly large reinforcements arrive. This can be risky as a bad card and die roll can severely damage the main Japanese fleet, but wiping the Allied carriers will effectively win the game and beats a long losing fight across the map.

The theme is definitely an interesting one, one of my favorites. The looks are fine in this game: well-drawn map, clear counters and good-looking overview all in all.

Rules (2.0) aren't that complex, no serious problems occurred in game after two consecutive read-throughs. I haven't tried 1.0 rules and it doesn't even matter whether I have or haven't, 2.0 works just fine and that's all I need. In rulebook, imho some of the repetition could have been cut down and reorganized, since some of the vital small additions to the rules tend to get lost in rulebook.

The only con is that basically you need to buy the deluxe map pack also, since it comes with 2.0 rules and a lot better-produced map.

The gameplay itself is fast-paced and includes a lot of options. I really don't like the pre-war and 1942 stuff in terms of gameplay, since it's basically a solo play for Japanese player. The drawback of the CDG is always the sometimes over-random draw. But whatever, this game is awesome despite the cons.

Edit: I also have the Deluxe Map for the game.

Interesting game on the Pacific War. Does a good job with naval and air combat at a strategic level.

The game is complex and requires a heavy investment of time to understand the rules and intended strategies. After several plays not sure I have all the rules down. Was difficult - especially airplane interdiction zone - to grasp the rules but playing a few rounds certainly made things clearer. The system has a lot of special cases to remember and track. The reaction of being "all or nothing" works, but doesn't seem to blend well with the other components of the system.
 
My complaint is the card decks definitely need to be split into early and late war. Yes the offensives can be thought as being generic. However, some of the special attributes are critical during certain phases of the war. With a large card deck a mistimed card will probably not recycle. One possibility would be to make sure that you "stack" the deck with some important early war cards in the first 18 cards or so.

I found the 1943 scenario to be the most playable with an authentic feel. The system seems to break down in the early and late war.

Another masterpiece by Mark Herman which actually allows you to re fight the Pacific War on a manageable time/real estate (the game comes with a single map). Just don't mistake it for a "lite" wargame.

The card system which drives the game is an evolution of Herman's own "We, the People", but also players of "Twilight Struggle" will feel a familiar vibe (TS is not strictly a wargame, but I mention it due to the fact that more people are familiar with it and it's key gameplay engine).

EotS spawned a brother, "Plan Orange", published  in C3I Magazine #29, about an hypothetical war in the '30. It is as good as the original, and suggested to those who love when aircraft carriers were still playing second fiddle to the big guns.

RATING: N/A
I've never fallen asleep during a game before, but I came real close with this one. I think it was the constant hex counting of my Japanese opponent. Not enough to do early on for the US, and then comes the flood of reinforcements... Just too high on the high scale of complexity for me. 
Looked great, but I can't see myself pushing for another game. Besides, I have little desire to play the Japanese myself. After having a grandfather almost killed in PNG and two great uncles severely traumatised as POWs, I don't have any great pleasure in taking out Burma or Singapore on behalf of the Shinto Emperor.

Played a couple of times. I had no trouble with the rules, but I did start with version 1.4.

However, I felt the entire game could be very easily lost by some early Axis "War in Europe" cards. If the Axis delays/removes enough Allied reinforcements (which doesn't seem that hard to do with two or three WiE cards,) the political will rule that states the Allies have to recapture 5 hexes starting in turn 4 will devastate the Allies. One game I played wasn't even close due to that.

It is much faster than most Pacific War games -- so having one wasted session is somewhat more acceptable, but I was still disappointed. Hopefully things will even out with more plays...

Incredible game. Takes CDGs to the next level, IMO. The focus on "offensives" that require coordination of Air, Naval and Land units makes the game fascinating to play. I also applaud the use of Hexes instead of Point-to-Point. It gives a very unique feel to the CDG. I don't know if the unique facets of the war in the pacific lends itself better to hexes than other periods/theaters do, but I would like to see more CDGs use hexes. 

My only quibble, and it is a minor one, is the use of weather as reaction events. I've read Herman's rebuttable to this, and I think that he puts it to much better use than most CDGs, but it still feels odd to me that the Japanese player can invoke the weather at will to cancel an offensive. I think it works well from a narrative standpoint and a game standpoint, but it troubles me from a simulation standpoint.

I like this game and may rate it higher after I have an opportunity to play it more.  Three downsides to this game are the long play time for the campaign game (the only game worth playing), the high variability with the first hand of cards for both sides, and the use of Political Will to force the US to sue for peace.  I would have liked to see a different mechanism to balance the assymetic nature of the two sides, perhaps a VP system or simply having a historically superior final position at the end.  Still, it is easier to criticize a game than design one.  The important thing is  it is fun to play and I want to play it again.

I feel the only drawback of this game is its complexity, one has to make an effort to understand the rules and learn how to play it. I believe this is Mark Herman's magnum opus in game design but it wouldn't surprise me if he would out do himself with a new game design. It has new innovations in wargaming like the way a defender can react to an attack. I never had many games on the war in the Pacific, I wasn't as interested in the subject but I am happy I got a copy. IMHO the best strategic game on the subject if one is looking for a deeper game. For in introductory one about the war in the Pacific AH's Victory in the Pacific would be my suggestion.

A CDG that does not play as a traditional CDG but more like a regular wargame. The focus is more on movement and maneuver and less on events, which takes away some of the agonizing decisions you have to do in other CDG. Having said that, EoTS has very interesting mechanics that handles the operative maneuveringing of the war. I think that some of the negative reviews this game has got is largely based on expectations of a different type of game. Recommended!

This game is a notch too hard rules-wise for my tastes. Paths of Glory is about as heavy a wargame  as I would want to take on (and POG is my favorite).

Trying to play the first turn of the game for the Japanese without referring to the provided play example is perhaps the most daunting thing I've seen in a game. It gets easier by the third turn though.

The combination of units -- ground, air and naval -- plays out very well on the grand strategic level.

An excellent game and simulation of the Pacific War. I really like how the game simulates the very crucial air/naval aspect of every operation.
The only thing that bothers me a bit about this game is that in the first half of the game the US player has very little to do and in the second half of the game it's the Japanese player who mostly can only watch without any action on his own. I understand that is how things went historically, but as a game it's a bit frustrating.

I actually bought this years ago but rebought recently thinking I must have missed something. No, this is poor.
Truly bizarre considering 'pacific war' is a masterpiece. 

This thing doesn't have any of the major hallmarks of the pacific - task forces move straight through land based air umbrellas, ignoring them entirely with the ability to then hammer their intended targets. Amphibious assaults take place ~2000 miles from base. Add both together and the Americans can assault Japan from almost the start of the game and it becomes largely pointless to create a forward air detection area - something which defined this war.

The above two break any immersion of the pacific.
Add to that a hex based game that doesn't really need hexes, the US having 'throw away' replacement steps which encourage US soaking attacks, a battle system where you can work out in advance your potential casualties. etc.
Just awful.

Great game.  Has one initial draw problem in my opinion; If the US gets an unanswered WiE or Inter-Service card the IJN is screwed.

Card Driven Game [CDG]
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Probably one of the best games in my collection and a true masterpiece. It's a bit daunting to try it out at first but once you understand the interlocking mechanisms of the game and understand how the design is purely driven by historical motivations (of which the infamous 'pinning' rule is the best example), you understand what a true gem this game is. It is engaging from start to finish and provides untold freedom of action without restricting the players too much, while still producing results that approximate history.

One of my few 10s and more than worthy of it.

Due to the complexity of the rules, I doubt I will ever get this monster on the table.  Due to my very positive experience with CDG's such as Hannibal, Successors and Barbarossa to Berlin, I expected the same from this, but obviously, one CDG can differ greatly from another.

Thinking about this, because it is both a hex-and-counter game and an CDG. And has a bot to run the opponent and so provide for a deep solo experience. But it is a behemoth and it's complexety probably quite a bit outside my comfort zone. Actually going for the 3rd printing due to its better bot.

An excellent game, rules are rather complex for a card-driven game. This game is hard to master, be prepared for a longer learning curve than games such as Paths of Glory or Wilderness War.

Quite a complex set of rules but the game plays fairly simply when underway. Things can get a bit wild and wooly with this game as combat and cards hands can be a bit/very unpredictable, with nothing assured.Great replay value

A game I've warmed up to after a few playings.  Though I've only played the yearly scenarios.  I'm not a big strategic level wargamer, but EOTS seems to do a good job of presenting the difficulties of the Pacific theater.  And splitting the Naval/Air battles from the Ground is great, while not being overly complicated.  In fact it really isn't that complex a game at all.  Ex. GBOH is much more complex. 

Expectations for a Pacific game seem to run the gamut, and people pan the game for different reasons.  Not enough detailed, too complex. Too easy on Japs.... Each hand represents 3 months time, so you're playing that in 7 to 8 card plays. Things are a little abstracted.  EOTS is not a full bore simulation, its aim is to be a playable Pac War game that can be finished in one very long sitting, (referring to full campaign game).  Some CDG fans won't like it b/c its not much like other CDGs, and you have to think much differently than POG or Hannibal.  It also got some bad press when it first came out, for a various and sometimes valid reasons.  I picked it up after some rules changes had been made.  

I find the rulebook to have two sections that are duplicates.  Nothing  contradictory though, and its otherwise well written.  The game isn't Hannibal easy, but neither is it that hard.  Mostly it just different, different from other Pac War games, and different from other CDGs.  Its sort of like Algebra, odd and confusing at first, easy once you know the rules.

Empire of the Sun is unbelievable; quirky & brilliant, unique in it's increased complexity in card usage & rule exceptions that weirdly make sense & aren't stapled onto the chassis but inherent to the strategic complications of inter-service rivalries, politics, the stealth of fleet activity, the asymmetry of the belligerents. The intricacy of the Burma theater and the time scale making stealth lightening strikes & rebasing of naval fleets are awesome. 

I'm learning so much about the Pacitic War with this.

I was disappointed that the game didn't really match the description as grand strategic that I had heard from the developer.  I found too much fiddly, fake operational detail that encouraged dubious or unhistorical player behaviours (massaging conquest timetable to sleaze PW penalties, scattering fleet deployments to avoid easy pinning attacks).  I expect the game with continue to evolve and will improve with time.

This rating seems low but 2 might even more correctly reflect my willingness to play again.  Still I might encounter a persuasive gamer some day.

Not for me.  The design choices are out of whack -- the map forcing you to deal with hex by hex tactical unit placement, only for the design notes to tell you not to take combat literally.  The combat results are unnecessarily coarsely grained.  And since a unit is a unit is unit for activation purposes, you activate your best units for your operations, unlike in history where the Japanese in particular often left the battleships at home.

A valiant effort, but hard to fathom the enthusiasm for this one.

Tried this 3 times via vassal and it's just never stuck with me. Rules are not well organized and the sequencing of events is not very clear to me. Given limited gaming time, I don't see value in spending more time on this one when considering games on the upper end of complexity.

Themapboard had an issue they will replace no questions asked.  They must have had a lot of issues about this they didn't even hesitate to give me a new one.  I really, really like GMT games, but the quality control hasn't been to great.  This is the third game I have had to contact them about. I really, I mean this, I really hate to see them have to replace components when if they got it right the first time everything would be ok.

Hard rules (version 2.0), because they are written under the law to use the minimum possible words. That creates holes and doubts,  by not to want to add some words more.
It is not a too complicated game, but as the rules are written  is more complicated.
On the other hand,  in the game there is several situations gamey, little intuitive and that I doubt that really they place you in the rol of the chief of staff. 

In these type of game is very important rules completed and well written because they are not intuitive. The FAQ is uncomplete, and must be more long, with more questions and examples.

More, as simulation naval is not very good (but is ok).  I think that an early/late war split in the deck is necessary to fix the simulation.

[COLOR=#FFFFFF][BGCOLOR=#009900]2P[/BGCOLOR][/COLOR] Grand strategy level wargame by Mark Herman covering the entire Pacific theatre in WW2. It offers exceptional strategic depth, operational realism and great historical detail. Probably the best game ever made on the Pacific War.

The rules have gone through a ton of rewrites, and are still awkward to parse.  I appreciate all the notes, but the redundancy and weird phrasing isn't helpful.

Core game ideas are interesting, but not quite as "revolutionary" as some remarks here might lead one to believe.  The reaction movement is really nice, and gives the game a very dynamic feel.  Lots of little details don't add much in terms of decisions, but definitely detract from ease of play.

A fairly easy game marred by overly complex rules.  For a card driven wargame there are too many details and exceptions.  If I ever solo it enough to feel more comfortable with the system my rating might go up.  Fantastic GMT components (map and cards).

This is the definitive "playable" Pacific War game. The learning curve can be a bit daunting, but definitely worth it.

This is fast becoming one of my favourite games and one of the few that I rate as a "masterpiece" in design.

Without a doubt, this has become my favorite wargame.  The depth of play is just amazing.  The lack of serious constraints on what you can do means the possibilities are endless, which equates to high replayability.  I have also learned so much about the unique nature of the conflict through this game.  What an incredible design!  And beautiful, too (I REALLY like Mark Simonitch's work)

This is probably the most complex CDG that we've played. It was a steep learning curve, not helped by a very badly written rulebook (or the way in which it was formatted), but we got there in the end and it was well worth it. The fact that it's hex-based rather than point to point movement, as in most CDGs, increases the complexity, but makes it a very different gaming experience. I loved the idea of using HQs to activate units. I also loved the tension of the game and the difficult decisions that each player is constantly forced to make.
The one downside of the game is the really boring combat system. I've been thinking of ways to change it, but so far have come up empty-handed.

Update (21/03/12): Started a new campaign game last week. It's been a few years since I played last, but it's still a very, very good game. However, I had forgotten about just how dull the battle resolution system is. During the first session Laurel and I complained a bit about it and how it might be changed. Then Laurel said something and I had a light bulb over the head moment! I jotted down a few notes that evening and the following morning, and then typed it all up. We've started testing it and it seems to work great.

The battle resolution system changes work within the framework of the original system, are very simple, but have had a massive impact on the dynamic of this part of the game. No changes to counters or cards were needed and nothing in the rules has had to be changed, except for the format of the battle resolution chart, how dice are rolled and how the existing battle modifiers affect die rolls.

Had this game for years and just realized I never rated it, doh! At first cracking of this box I was completely overwhelmed by the rules and had no clue what I was doing. It wasn't until I started playing several wonderful opponents online and participated in a Consim World staff game that everything started to click. A big problem I think for most new players is after understanding the rules is setting up the game and going, what the heck do I do now? The game will take several plays to start to get the hang of the strategy, and after a bit I was helping others learn the trade so to speak. Brilliant design, and if I could compare it to anything I would call it a modern day chess, because every move you make is just like that. Great thinking game. 

I really excited about the makeover and the updated rules. Pre ordered and hope it comes out first quarter of 2015 as promised.

Me encanta la geografía y recorrer los mapas con los dedos. 

Si a esto sumas el mando de los mayores buques de guerra de la historia luchando por cada isla, unos tratando de llegar a Japón para forzar su rendición y otros con todo el mundo en contra, sin nadie en quien apoyarse. Vigilando en todo momento tierra, cielo y mar. 

No se forman frentes claros como en tierra firme. Sólo los golpes que se le dan al rival lo son.

In early playing, this seems like a real winner, certainly the best combination of playability and comprehensive overview I've yet seen in a strategic PacWar game. The rules are not perfect, but I've had little trouble playing this so far. Figuring out strategy is another matter entirely...

Now that it has 'bots this could well be the game for me on all of the Pacific Theater. I had hoped DVG Nimitz would have been the one but ended up selling it right away.
And yet, having seen Churchill's 'bots I am a bit afraid Erasmus won't live up to my soloist expectations...

Please Note: obviously I would prefer this year's second edition...

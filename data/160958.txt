GAME: DC Comics Deck-Building Game: Rivals – Batman vs The Joker
RANK: 1967
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
1st play: I liked what they were going for here. The street fighter deck building system was fun, but I liked this one more because of the one vs one feel of the rivals. The conflict mechanic was interesting, but it was really hard to get an attack past my opponents defense. I'm ok with this and I think after a couple plays we would be able to actually knock each other out. 

2nd play: I still liked the theme, and this time, we didn't go until the deck ran out, but the game kindof stagnated instead. There aren't enough cards that remove old, crappy cards from the deck, so we ended up never having anything to buy and just drawing cards and hoping for a lucky sequence to knock out the other player. Neat idea, needs some work.

A good game and introduction to the DC Deckbuilding game world. I actually widh they had made a DC Deckbuilding game in this format first with expansions vs. the mega boxes. Now... I want to see Superman vs. Lex Luther?

RATING: 7.6
A very good introduction to the DC Deckbuilding universe if you just want to throw down with 2-player, and it does keep the theme a little more coherent since the selection is so limited. That said, I much prefer the base game with a bunch of the expansion stuff mixed in, and I don't know if I'd mix these...still, works as intended.

Initial Impression: I have to say that this game surprised me. I went into it not expecting much but the artwork and simple gameplay has won me over. The artwork in particular reminds me of the darker works found in "The Killing Joke" or "The Dark Knight Returns". The game felt light but with some meaningful decisions. The mechanisms are familiar to those who've played other common deckbuilders. Although this game is all about attacking and defending against your opponent, I didn't find the direct interaction to be too "in your face". For me, the fun was in creating the card combos, of which there is the potential for many. I would definitely play this game again, given the option.

RATING: 7
Fun game but after two plays we are wondering if to actual win by confrontations you need a hell of a lot of luck in getting your hand just right, the last game I only had one hand over 9 power (10) and I didn't bother wasting a turn on teh assumption my opponent would have a block card so I bought a high power card instead - that was the only time I had a hand able to make one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Nice change up form the original game that can be played as a stand alone or with the other sets.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
cool that this has some new cards, and while I can appreciate the thoughts of the multi-costed heroes, this is NOT my favorite way to approach this universe. So it has been folded into the main game never to be removed again as a solo play. The hero cards are mostly in their boxes forever, but I can see playing them on some special occasions, picking out one of them for some other scenarios.

The back and forth of not being able to really damage one another for so long drug this one out for us both, and made it an unenjoyable experience.

Rating wouldn't be kind and is slightly out of context since I like the main game so I am going to abstain.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
I didn't have high expectations going in, since the DC Deck builder is a disaster, however this one better than I thought it would be.  Thematically it doesn't really work that well, but the card design / artwork is very good.  This one fixes a few of the issues I had with the normal game, and its playing time was around an hour.  One I can see playing from time to time as a light 2p game.

Would have been a 9.5, but the set needed more cards with destroying abilities. Deck Builders with lots of destroying abilities are super fun!

I was really expecting this to be a little more about the fighting.  It takes too long to build up your deck into something that makes a fight worthwhile.  Then, there are really only a couple fights in the whole game.  Not a lot of tension or feeling of a battle between Batman and the Joker.

RATING: 7
This is missing some stuff, there are a few too many nothing turns and not enough deck thinning. But the attack mechanic works for me and I am a massive Batman fan.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I like this, for a fun little 2 player version of DC Deck-Building.  It feels a lot like the usual game of DC Deck-Building but I like that you feel you are your character more and the act of directly attacking the other person is ever present.  And just because you are attacking the other player that doesn't mean that that is what will decide the game.  You get points the normal way, through building your deck, you just don't have any big bads you are going against.  That will just be the player you are playing against.  I am looking forward to seeing more of these Rival Packs and I will obviously buy them all.

I like the one on one play of this "expansion," especially with the confrontation mechanism (seen in a form in NHL Power Play).  I can see this being combined with a future Rivals set (Superman vs. Lex Luthor, Wonder Woman vs. Cheetah) for two on two team play, or possibly even every player for themselves.

Owned and got rid. Not a bad deckbuilder but not the best. There is no real theme, and unfortunately I have not taken to the Cryptozoic formula- The recent attack on titan deckbuilder does interest me. But if I had to choose a superhero deckbuilder, I would go for upper deck's marvel legendary.

Or call it: DC Deck builder the Two Player Game. Comes with it's own mini deck with all you need - punches, kicks, vulnerability, weaknesses and a new main deck. Each player has three character cards which act as super villain or super hero to the other that you must defeat to win. The confrontation mechanic is what you use to attack the other player but can be blocked meaning you won't always knock out your opponent when you think you have enough power. Our first game scored 51 to 50. Will require more plays to see if it always stays close.

Bought because its an offshoot of DC Deckbuilder. I keep this separate from other expansions. 3 jokers vs 3 batmans. You can add the deck to any other expansion, but like I said I will not. Not bad, its an aggressive two player take that game.

2017-05-08 - This is a decent deckbuilder, but takes a little longer to play than I would like. It works very well as a gateway game for a teenager, though.

2017-07-17 - I bought this to play with my little, and I gave it to him to play with his brothers when he moved away.

RATING: 6.5
An interesting two player version of the DC deck building game. I have won both by Knockout and by stalling and starving the draw deck, which I feel eliminates a runaway leader problem. My only complaints are that trashing cards is not common enough and the game forces you to focus only on half the cards to maximize your ability
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This was a throw in game to get some free shipping. Bought it because of the theme Batman V Joker. As a deck builder its pretty simplistic. It was easy to teach the wife and we both had a good time playing it.

I will say that the idea of the Joker and Batman being able to purchase either villains or heroes is a bit strange, but if you can get past that it's a really fun game to play duo.

Ha önmagában a játékot nézzük, akkor teljesen rendben van, egy jó kis deck-building. Ha viszont már volt szerencsénk néhány Cryptozoic kiadású deck-buildinghez, akkor azért fájdalmasan kevésben térnek ezek el egymástól. Persze, mindegyikben van valami apró kis eltérés, de ezek szerintem nem jelentenek gyökeresen más játékélményt. Kis túlzással, ha egyet ismerünk, akkor már a többit is, a rendszer alapvetően ugyanaz.

After a video review, seems like the other DC game, but the 2 player only aspect seems to solve many issues with the original game. Like card analysis: too much card movement force reading all the time, lack of confrontation between players.

But most of the other issues remain there: Simplistic game, 1 resource, Non-thematic (put villains in your deck), no ability to thin your deck, etc.

This game was somehow both boring and confusing.  I like Batman and LOVE the Joker, in terms of Batman's rivals, so, I'm glad I have the game.  However, it really is not a good game :/

Got it as an incentive to get the rest of the DC Deckbuilders, but when Lord of the Rings Deckbuilders crashed and burned, I lost interest in the whole light deckbuilding shebang from this company.

It is pretty and quick to play, but it is not a clever deckbuilding game, and there are so many in that genre now.

I've played this game with a friend a ton of times so after a while you start to memorize cards and prioritize cards and it starts getting dull. We now prefer to shuffle any expansion into the main deck (all the main deck cards + super villians) just for added difference. (If playing this way if u get more than 2 super villians add a 6th card to the line up until it goes back under 2)

I went into this one thinking it was going to suck, because Tom Vasel was not happy with DC Deck-building. However, it's not terrible. Honestly, I only like light deck-builders like Star Realms a decent bit. I don't need two of them. While I can appreciate this game. I have no desire to get this one instead of Star Realms. And Marvel Legendary fulfills the other end of this spectrum.

Brought down my rating from 7 to 6 after a 2nd play.  Getting the right combination of cards to take down your rival is quite hard, and so play drags on with just buying up the deck.  Not as much fun as the regular game, and special rules mean we can't cycle these cards into the regular deck either, which is a disappointment.

Kind of MEH with this game.  It's not bad but depending on luck, you could have a hard time ever taking on the opposing player and it ends up being a points game with your deck...  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A spicy 2-player adaptation of the Cryptozoic deck-building system.  If nothing else, it does a better job than the original of preventing a runaway leader.

The rub is that the new mechanic that livens things up (Confrontations) may be too painful for its own good. There's nothing worse than wasting 9-15 power on a blocked Confrontation, since those same points could have been used to purchase 3-5 points (at least) of VP cards.  Tip: High-value Block cards are really valuable.

Still, the variety and minor novelties are appreciated, and as a head-to-head attacking game I definitely prefer this to Star Realms.

[i]Update:[/i]

My wife and kids love deck-builders, so at the moment this is the only 2-player game getting tabletime in our house.  In fact, I think it's the only 2-player game that we've busted out in years.

I've also used Rivals to introduce nongamers to deck-building.  So far, folks really like it.

Nagyon jól eltalálták, megint csavartak egyet a dolgon. Izgalmas és nagyon konfrontatív, közben meg a szokásos DC deck-building. Egy baj lehet, az pedig az újrajátszhatóság, de más DC-be keverve ez is megoldódik, ott meg feldobja az alappaklit. Ez bizony must have, ha bejön a mechanika és a téma!

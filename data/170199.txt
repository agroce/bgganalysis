GAME: Solarius Mission
RANK: 1995

RATING: 5
1 play / 2 players

LIKE: Space euro! Love the theme and dice drafting. Lots of options to think about and very interesting upgrades. I liked the map and choosing whether to colonize a planet or use it for resources.

DISLIKE: No tension. Very fiddly. It would get a rating bump from me if game actions were streamlined a bit more, but as it stands, there are too many small rules to remember. Managing the player boards (4 different cargo bays?) was boring and uninspiring. The rulebook was fine, but production tokens were too tiny. I had spare parts so this wasn't an issue for me, but for others it could be.

OVERALL: *SIGH* I wanted to love this game. I thought this was the one for me, but it was disappointing. No tension. Too fiddly. Not streamlined. I wanted to see more interaction with planet colonies instead of fiddling with the player dice. Signorie, another dice drafting game I found lacking, had more tension in the dice drafting than this game. I may try Solarius again, but I just don't find it compelling.

First Play: This is a game that will never full-fill it's potential in the gaming ratings owing to its near impenetrable rule book (at least in it's English version) and lack of a comprehensive player aid.

I read the rules three times and could not fathom how anything joined up. The BGG concise rules were much clearer but the mechanisms of the game are so conjoined it makes explaining the game a real chore. My audience kept asking 'but where does 'x' fit in?' and all I kept replying was 'Well get to that later'.

None but the most hardened euro-phile will stick this one out. One of our four lasted an hour and had to apologise and bail. All he could say was 'none of this makes sense'. 

The remaining three did stick it out and really enjoyed it but the mesh on that filter is bloody fine. This is a game that needs the same group to run through repeated plays. Explaining to new players will be an hour added to the start of the game and a real chore for all but the most patient. Please please please Speilworxx, you produce great games, why don't you dedicate more time to getting the rules logical and clear? Instructions saying to 'sort out' one tile is not the same as 'remove one tile'. The minuscule round counters for the money, fuel, and colonies are just a joke. It's like you are almost deliberately trying to make people dislike your games. Stop it.

A neat sandbox game. You want to do everything, but you'll never have the time, since you only get 16 turns. The randomness of the dice does make this one more tactical than strategic, but there's definitely a good game in there.

RATING: 9
Woow what a great game. This game is on the medium heavy side. Understanding the rules from the rulebook took its share bit of time but the deep gameplay made upp for that investment... This game refines the mechanics in la granja and improves them.  There are so much you can do each turn so you have many possible strategies you can explore, the game remindes me of terra mystica in that regard. The game dont feel solitare on 4 player game since the board is crowded and getting outpost bonuses out has to balanced with building your engine. So a good tension with immidiate vp vs engine building. Want to play this game more. Didnt expect such a good game. Negatives are: component, gui that is not always clear. Many if statements for knowing when to do what... but the game is in turn balanced. Highly recommend this game.

Definitely seems deeper than its predecessor "La Granja"... but seems different enough that I really didn't see enough similarities to compare the two.  The game definitely doesn't give you enough actions to do what you want, but leaves just the perfect amount of hope that it keeps things tense and interesting.  There are a couple things that seem a bit too fiddly, and make no thematic sense, but overall this is a fun game, and one I am looking forward to playing more of.  Yes there are component issues... and the rulebook isn't very good, but I still think this is worth picking up if you like "Heavier games".  Oh... The sticker dice are awful... and sticking them all was a pain in the butt.

Euro de los pesados. Gestión de recursos y obtención de puntos en exploración espacial. La base del juego son el uso de los dados, con un rondel tipo Ora et Labora. Los dados pueden avanzar por un track o subir de nivel.
Se pueden obtener puntos de muchas maneras. Se pueden colonizar planetas, cumplir misiones,  almacenar recursos.. obtener bonus). Ofrece muchas opciones.. 
Ahora bien, las explicaciones son largas y duras. Es un juego entretenido, pero solo apto para jugones.

11/7/16 - designer Andreas Odendahl from La Granja so this was a must buy/try. Not sure why the rating on this game is so low - this is a very tight design and every move is key. This is one of those games where you are left wanting more. Very thinky but rewarding. Would've been nice if the spaceships were on a stand so they would've been easier to pick up and move.

Very nice, strategic game with a "sandbox" feel. I love games where it seems like you can do anything: explore, settle, research, etc. and this game delivers. Unlike lots of other sandbox style games, however, Solarius Mission gives players lots of ways to set their own long- and short-term scoring goals, which I love. It gives this game a focus that a lot of other games of this type don't have.

There may be a higher luck element here than I would like, not so much in the dice but in the discovery aspect of the game, which can give a fortunate player a distinct edge over others because of a lucky draw. But still I find the game fun to play and find the resource mechanisms (balancing quality vs. quantity of goods) to be very clever and challenging.

Enjoyably thinky space exploration-themed Euro with similar resource management, card drafting and area control elements as La Granja, but without the significant randomness -- or with random elements better ameliorated? -- and with an enjoyable theme. Gameplay challenge comes more from action efficiency/planning than pure bean counting. Ripper of a game. Rated an 8 after a first, incomplete play, increased to a 9 after a full play the following day. (November 2016)

It is too difficult to sum up this game in a short paragraph. It is from the designers of La Granja and that pedigree is evident with the clever use of dice. Here there is less randomness than in La Granja as the dice you select comes from a system straight out of the resource wheel from Ora Et Labora: you have to choose a die and the cost of that die reduces each round which it isn’t taken.

The die you choose determines the action you can take and importantly, the number of those actions you take. The actions you take vary but ultimately you are trying to build stuff in space by moving your space-ship around. And this is where the map comes in. You need to plan the route you take very carefully in order to optimise the places you drop space stations and explore planets. At the end the player with the best connections in space gains more points.

What lets this game down, and this is a problem with many Spielworxx games, is the poor rule book. But don’t let that put you off. 

If you like La Granja but are happy to be taken deeper into more complex mechanisms of the depth of Madeira, and you like some added route planning to be added into the mix, then this is your game.

RATING: 8
2017-10-01 : First play. Space empire engine builder through action selection. Multiple avenues to victory, feels like a sandbox game - one in which you know you'll have exactly 16 plays. A very well-done combination of long term strategy with short term tactical play.and where you better have a plan B ready when your turn comes up.
2017-11-27 : Played 3 times so far and I've seen various strategies score a good number of points : zip around to gobble up all the same kind of planets - especially feasible with green and brown, go for planet sets, go for space stations, go mission heavy, do a bit of everything, ...so it seems the ideal strategy is the classic : do what the other players aren't doing and tactically maximize it.
2018-01-18 : 6 weeks between plays and I didn't even have to open the rulebook again before or during the rules teach. For me that's the sign of a solid game

RATING: 7
This is a game where, whilst I might have a few different options on how to achieve it, I might use the same strategy every time.  At that point the challenge will be on the luck of execution (vs. having to think through various options).  In other words, one clear path to victory.  It's a fun game, but this tempered my rating slightly.

RATING: 8
This is a complicated game to write a comment for due to the sub-par production issues (unacceptable), the rules (not the best), and the gameplay (quite enjoyable). So let’s separate them. 

The production was a bit of a fiasco. You have to sticker 36 dice (that’s 216 stickers, folks!), then you have to glue together the dice board, and then you have to email the publisher for replacements for discs that require tweezers to handle (“Spinal Tap style” as someone aptly calls them). I had friends help with the stickers so it wasn’t that big a deal. I glued the dice board together easily enough (though why not a post-and-pin mechanism again?), but I still had to come up with markers for fuel and space bucks (as they weren’t included in the replacement discs). All in all, annoying friction for $60.

The rules were not as bad as I had expected. I learned the game well enough from the book, though there are translation ambiguities (not translated by a native English speaker). But for all the griping I heard about the rules (“unusable!”), I was surprised to find that I learned the game from them fairly well with just a few grey areas. In particular, the distinctions between resource cubes and resource points are not clear. I did, however, create my own player aid (posted to BGG) to help get my head around the different types of wood pieces that you want to build (the thrust of the game) and I highly recommend you use that when learning the game. 

Now at last to the gameplay. You play 4 rounds of 4 turns each. In those 16 turns, you do a Die Action (with your tech dice) and then a Secondary Action. The goals of your actions are to upgrade your tech dice as well as fly around the ‘verse and put your wood pieces on the board (claimed planets, constructed space stations, completed missions). Without going into great detail, these each have in-game benefits and endgame VPs. Whether you pursue a specialized strategy of just chasing planets vs a hybrid of a little bit of everything is up to you. The sexiest part of the game is choosing to play cards for either bonus power upgrades or as need-to-be-completed mission cards. You can make some nice bonus power combos or just go hell bent for mission VPs.

And this here is the fun of the game. This is a sandbox game where it’s up to you to decide how to play it. It’s not obvious what you should do, and you’ll have to decide what type of strategy you wish to pursue – and then go make it happen. I like the openness and creativity afforded to/required of the players. You can spend time building up your powers or just chase missions or planets. 

In our first game, a player rode a bunch of planets to victory. In our second, I won using a hybrid strategy with (IIRC) three of everything and strategically placed markers on the board. Point is, it seems after a couple plays there is no dominant strategy. 

On the downside, the interaction of the game is mild at best. I’ve come to detest games with personal player boards but fortunately these are not of that ilk. You compete with each other by drafting dice (you can hate draft effectively to deny a player the action die they need) and sniping opportunities on the board. That’s it, so it’s more of a race game with some mild bumping into each other. I wish the game had more player interaction in some way. Not attacking, that’s so boring, but maybe forcing contamination (a negative VP thing) onto each other. 

Overall, I like the game for the creativity it allows you in building your own powers and finding your own VP path.

Die Spielworxx-Regel ist mal wieder von hinten durch die Brust ins Auge. Ich konnte mir zunächst überhaupt kein Spiel dazu vorstellen, das den Begriff auch verdient. Aber dann beim Spielen merkt man: SOLARIUS MISSION hat was! Vor allem wieder Würfel. Die Macher von LA GRANJA lieben Würfel. Und Zitate. Auch in SM, wenn auch nicht ganz so offensiv geehrt wie damals auf Malle. Und SM ist auch weniger zugänglich: zwar nicht viele Regeln, trotzdem irgendwie frickelig. Dazu passt auch das kleinteilige China-Material und die Icons überall. Der Minimensch bearbeitet das All. Teilweise werden die kleinen Regeln symbolisch abgebildet, teilweise aber auch nicht. SM ist ein komplexes, anspruchsvolles Spiel, das sich wenig intuitiv spielt und den Spieler in einem permanenten, schönen Ich-will-mehr-machen-als-ich-kann-Gefühl hält. SM ist ein Spiel, das  seinen Reiz im Laufe der Partien mehr und mehr entfaltet, wenn man die Miniregeln intus hat. Dann erwartet einen ein intelligentes, sperriges Eurogame im All, das einen berechtigten Charakter-Platz im Sternenhimmel über LA GRANJA einnehmen darf. Tendenz der Plastik Shuttle Rakete steigend.

Impression after the first game: Quintessentially Euro-game
which need more plays to get in the game and the strategic possibilities. It is very complex and a brain teaser (It will be easier if you play it more times I think). The game mechanisms are simple and it has a simple game flow if you get the rules (there are a lot of specific rules). 
Finally, I would play it again, whether it feels dry and unemotional!

RATING: 8.5
Components: good ones, but round pieces are unnecessary small
Complex: hard to teach and learn
Weight: heavy
Players: 3 or 4
Length: around 2 hours
Mechanics: select dice, move through space, improve technology
Decisions: a lot
Opinion: amazing game, you will have lot of things to do and many ways to go for victory, this could make the game hard to understand at the beginning (probably you would like to do them all).
Pick a die from the bridge and do its action, then you do your turn action. So far so easy.
But dice have different colors associated to one action, and, depending on the level of that action the die could be more powerful. Then you do your action... should I go for missions, or play technology cards and go for planets, oh wait, I prefer to go for building things in space!!!!
I love the dice system (not much luck involved if you play well), and all those open options you have to do during the game. Different players can go for different things and have options for winning. There is quite interaction on the board, but not a lot.
A small comparison (I have played Solarius and Great Western on the same session)... Great Western has a unique goal, and you can do lot of things in between, but the goal is the same for everybody (cow delivery), in Solarius you do not have an unique goal, you can go for so many things that you cannot do all of them, something I love in games.
Going back to Solarius, the technology dice are also lovely, as you have to decide if you need them with a higher value or moved to a different column (allowing more and better resources).
Lets say it one more time... lot of options and decisions to take in this game, but all of them amazing!!

Very unique dice mechanic. The designers of La Granja again did a great job by blending known and popular mechanics in other games into one amazing package. 

Unfortunately the components are to be desired. For a $70 game, you have to stick the dice by yourself. You had to be really careful about sticking the dice (I did mess up 2 of it and still waiting for the replacement stickers to arrive). And those player discs, those microscopic player discs are just ridiculous. 

Had it not been for the components issue, I would've rated this a 9. However I had to peg it down to a 7.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

First play felt like there was way too many things to do and way too little time to accomplish said things. Future plays will determine how true this is versus how inefficient we were in learning the game, but it appears one will have to pursue one or two specific ways of gaining points. Production levels are ridiculous - by this time I expect far more of Spielworxx - the tiny discs are almost unforgiveable and unplayable and it is good they are providing replacements. The sticker dice doesn't bother me. No conflict in this game - just racing to beat others to build or complete missions in some cases. I'm not convinced I see the comparisons to La Granja.

RATING: 9
This is among my favorite games.

Heavy Euro with unusual usage of dice. Some randomness due to the dice mechanism requires to plan for the alternatives. You always have several options what to do, so in this case, the randomness makes the game more interesting.

The rulebook is in my opinion not well structured and wording is often ambigous. It is difficult to learn the game from the rule book and to clarify questions during the game. This is true for the German and the English version of the rules. 

Great help directly from the authors if you post questions in BGG.

I find the components ok except for the supertiny disks which I replaced with larger ones. And yes, you have to put the stickers on the dice, but so what.

Best Spielworxx title in a long time. I didn't even care for La Granja that much. This has a Signorie feel, with the colored dice drafting and custom engine building.

Planets are random but at least you can prep for what you might encounter. Bring tweezers.

Read that again and ponder the exhilarating incompetence of this publishing company, Spielworxx. They can't even spell 'works' because nothing does. 4) If you haven't been laughing hard enough at this point, you need to sticker the dice. 5) Considering this mess actually got approved by curious George, a simian who was working the assembly line, you would expect a price point of $10. No, it costs $100. And why not? It's 2016, the age of "Let's see what we can get away with." 

Thankfully, the game also comes with lube and instructions on how to bend over. Here's a better game: Your "mission",  should you choose to accept it, is to remember the name of these designers, the publisher, and never support them again.

Solarius Mission is a dice action-selection game in which players explore and colonize the galaxy.  The game features a number of different ways to excel, including colonizing planets, building space stations, completing pick-up-and-deliver missions (actually more like produce-and-deliver), or just building up your player board.  The first part of a player's turn involves taking a die and doing the action of that color with a strength equal to the number of pips.  Dice that have been sitting around for a while provide a bonus, and some dice have special star pips whose value is determined by your tech board.  This die action usually lets you produce resources or enhance your player board.  The second part of a player's action involves moving around the galaxy to build space stations, colonies, and missions.  The game doesn't provide much direction for the players, so it's up to them how they want to develop their empire.  While the game is pretty hard to explain--lots of little fiddly rules, and the rulebook is a mess--once you get the hang of it, things start to make sense.  The game really provides a wide-open engine-building feel, and will appeal to those looking for that sort of experience.

This is point salad in space. The thing that's really compelling about it aside from the unusual theme is that just like most point salad games, high value scoring comes from focusing in on one or two things, but here the game gives you intense efficiency incentives to spread out and wind up scoring less for everything. Despite the shared central board, with competition for spaces, and the die drafting mechanism, the game does feel a little multiplayer solitaire, which can be a good or bad thing depending on what you prefer.  The action options are all really interesting although remembering it all can be difficult. The player board has some reminder information, but not enough to cover all you need to retain, so a better player aid would be a very welcome addition to the game. Once learned, it does all make sense, but don't expect to understand what a good action looks like until towards the end of your first game.

One thing I have to mention is that the disk components in the game are ludicrously small. The spots they go seem like standard size... the disks that came in the box are so small they HAVE to be a manufacturing mistake.

Unfortunately that rulebook has some troubles at first and all the work you have to do to assembly the game by your own doesn't help, but once you go over such things, the game is very nice and deserves it's 8+. Hope for a better rulebook some day or at east a fanboy detailed FAQs ☺

solid, but too sandboxey for our tastes. plus, i think this game has convinced me that i'm simply not interested in space empire building as a theme, because mechanically it's rock solid!

:) Game sure has character due to the orginal action selection mechanism

:) The game certainly grows; there are different engine building opportunities

:) The game is a challenging optimization puzzle

:soblue: There is a rather high amount of luck and chaos involved in the action selection mechanic. When certain die-colors do not come out for selection, this might lead to some frustratingly inefficient deviations in your bigger plan. This is a serious problem in this challenging strategy game: you only have 16 actions, can you really afford to spend 3 on an alternative path (and maybe in the next round, the die color you require does come out?). There is also some chaos and luck involved in colonizing planets.

:soblue: This game is plain ugly and the components are awful: a game run by dice shouldn't make use of stickers to mark the die sides. Iconography is pretty much a disaster. I don't know what happened with the graphical design of this title, but I sure happen it doesn't every happen again in a future boardgame release.

:soblue: The game engine is not very elegant: there are tons of tiny and slightly confusing rules, which makes explaining this game to new players a bit of pain.

Ugh. The rules are a mess and overly complex. The space exploration game with 1 ship all game and engine management. Zzzz. 

Played with 3 of us, 2 euro gamers and a hybrid euro/trash player. None of us truly enjoyed it and wouldn't play again. I mean really not our cup of tea

Really neat mechanisms that lead to some interesting decisions. The problem is the other things that are tacked on for thematic reasons and to balance it. There are some really clunky rules (like how the hubs come out and how you get an additional bonus building next to them and bonus VP) that just hurt the game a lot in my eyes. The random elements can really turn an otherwise heavy game on its head by just getting screwed by luck. Also, the game feels a bit too short duration wise. Like maybe if players had a bigger head start at the beginning it would get the ball rolling more. Just feels slightly off at some parts.

It is definitely not a bad game at all and figuring out what to do on your turn is neat. But ultimately it just feels like mechanisms slapped together with some other mechanisms acting as glue to keep them from completely falling apart. Doesn't feel like a true cohesive whole.

tl;dr: good, but how good?

So when the designers of [thing=146886][/thing] (one of the best games of 2014 I think) put out a new game from the publisher of La Granja, I'm paying attention. When said game also sports a conflict free space exploration theme (seems like a mini [thing=198190]trend[/thing] this year), it shoots to the top of my 'want to play' list. And I finally got hold of a copy!
I was a bit surprised by how heavy this game was. I expected a medium weight game, but it is a bit heavier than that. It's also not very intuitive. Not that the rules are that complex, but how you effectively achieve your goals, that's not a clear straight path.
I did really badly at the game (I came dead last) but I really enjoyed playing it. I was a bit disappointed that one player who mainly colonized planets, won by a huge margin. That gave us the impression that is the only strategy that is worth pursuing. I hope that is not the case. La Granja clearly gives players multiple paths to victory.
So I really liked it, and want to play it again. I just hope there's more to it than grabbing as many planets as you can early on.
In any case, the rules take their time to explain you everything, but while explaining the rules, some questions came up that I had to look up. I think I'd best reread them to clarify any issues we might have had.

Initial rating: 7.5/10

The stickered dice and production problems of Dilluvia Project have me a bit worried, but I am hoping this game will be at least as good as La Granja.

The rules are dense, I am not good with glue (it sticks to me!), and the ludicrously small discs have to be replaced.

There is a lot going on in this game and not many actions to do it all. This game is heavier than La Granja and will take some time to grok. Specialization seems to be the way to go, but it takes fuel/SpaceBucks/resources to power points gathering, and being limited by the dice that are available makes it even harder.

Requested replacement pieces 12/05/16.

Clunky, non-intuitive. Little to no interaction. Horrendous rule book. I quickly stopped caring what I was doing due to how samey and bland the actions are.

Practically unplayable with the provided components. Requires glue and replacement pieces. The start player token is not as depicted in the rulebook. Stickering wooden dice is basically the worst. The rulebook translation is iffy at best. My first attempt to teach the game ended in failure. I hope this turns around upon finally playing for the first time but I have had nothing but bad impressions and road blocks so far.

There are some nice mechanisms here but ultimately it's very clunky, and the rulebook is pretty bad too. There is a rich get richer element, because when you place something on the board, you get resources, but that also is going to get you points. And then because you got more resources you can place more stuff...
Discovering new planets are annoyingly random, and the dice can get random sometimes too.
There isn't really much escalation in the game either. Not much combos. Half the time you get some cubes, then spend them.

Expect this rating to go up with more plays (2 plays so far).  A bit opaque on first play due to iconography and multitude of scoring options at end of game.  Helps to explicitly explain those scoring categories when teaching new players.  2nd play revealed more layers, expect more to be revealed in future plays.  Multiple paths to victory with the need to balance multiple categories, i.e., victory unlikely by pursuing only one path.  Abstract, yet thematic, a juxtaposition that has me searching for the right words to explain.  I feel like I'm doing stuff in space, but I also feel like I'm running an abstract and mechanical efficiency engine.  The mechanics here are rock solid, so if you are a fan of abstracts or dry Euros with great mechanics, you owe yourself an opportunity to try this one.

Main comparison with La Granja for me comes from chaining and sequencing of free actions during your turn to enhance your main action.  That puzzle element is present in both games and is fun, satisfying and challenging.  It also is something that you feel like you get better at with each play.  That sense of progression is usually a sign of a good to great game and provides a compelling reason to repeatedly bring the game back to the table.

I appear to be in the minority among english speakers, but I did not have much difficulty with the rulebook as written.  Perhaps I was helped by having another friend who simultaneously and idependently learned the game.  Between the two of us, I feel we got all rules correct on our first play together (although it was his 4th play and I did end up flagging a couple of rules that he had been playing incorrectly).  But nothing unexpected happened for me after reading the rules, so I feel like I had a good grasp on them going into my first play.

There is the disk component issue, but seriously, this is not a reason to rate the game down significantly in my opinion.  It is completely playable and works fine out of the box.  

The gluing required is minor and the glued dial works perfectly fine after a quite simple assembly process.  I recommend using a glue that is more pasty, like a glue stick, to avoid a mess or over application.  Just scrape a chunk of glue stick off with a toothpick, apply it and you are good to go.  The plastic rings between the base and the dial spinner relieve any stress that might otherwise be applied to the glue joint when operating the spinner, so once it is together, it shouldn't ever come apart.  Would a clip or screw solution have been simpler and cleaner?  Yes.  But the solution as is is fine.  I think the apparent outrage over it is quite overstated.

Pulp Sci-fi space 3X without the extermination.  Point salad, dice driven, medium weight euro. Unique and intriguing player boards track tech tree advances both by level and frequency using pip values and colored dice in conjunction with the dice draft rondel--for me this is the challenging nut to crack.  This game is all about optimization of a fixed number of moves while managing contamination.  I like that upgrade cards double as an optional scoring objective. Stickering the dice is a bummer.

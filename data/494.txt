Fun, fun game. Lots of luck (although not without a degree of decision making) but that doesn't matter 'cos it plays quickly and it's just fun. Our favourite filler by far

RATING: 7.5
Simple game easily taught. Quick fun to wreak havoc on opposing players. Use all 6 chariots for the most bang. 
Not as much fun as Winners Circle but a nice card mechanic to power the race.

RATING: 7
A fun and light race game. Since you typically end up using most of your cards, I think that most of the luck revolves around having the right card at the right time (such that you can block chokepoints etc).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.75
This is just a beer-n-pretzels game where the breaking of balls makes for a world of fun, if you enjoy that kind of thing. It's not meant to be anything more or anything deeper than that.

Works best with the full complement or as close to that as possible. 

Smiles and raucous laughter are a dominant feature with this one.

ave ceasar: love it, especially with the ramming rule where things can get quite nasty and the carnage a bit more with a high possibility of not being able to cross the line... 

q-jet: nice little spaceships, pleasant to move, but meh, give me chariot racing any day... 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A quick and light racing game.  Nothing too amazing here, but works well for what it is.  A good family game really.  Try and play with the rules of ramming that you can find here on the geek, makes it much more cutthroat.

Ave Caesar is a nice game to wait for something bigger: there is a bit of strategy (a little bit) and some luck involved... The game is fairly repetitive but easy to learn and fun to play if not drawn to frequently. I don't feel the need to own it but could definitely play a game on occasion.

Horse races are fun. I thoroughly enjoyed the 30minutes it took. Might be even playable with children.

However, I reckon the game would benefit from some special events, variable track conditions or a modular board to add longevity to it. Even some bidding might enhance it.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Simple and a good racing game. There are some tactics involved also, since you can block another carriage.

RATING: 6
Hmm...there's not much to this - even less than its close cousin The Really Nasty Horse Racing Game.  But this is a more glossy product and I prefer the chariot racing theme.

Essentially there's precious little in the way of Strategy, and some very obvious tactics, but even so, I found myself enjoying this - but I wouldn't want to play it too often.  As a race game, for instance, Mississippi Queen is much more interesting.

I think children from about 6 up would enjoy it though, and I can see teenagers loving it...and so maybe that's the best place for it - a teenagers and family game.  Just the sort of thing that your kids could take into school on the last day of term.

Really made for 5-6 players.  Not sure I would rate highly for less than 5 players.  I would agree that there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of strategy.  If I get time I'd like to add some event cards to use during the race.

RATING: 5
Light racing game that you would think would offer you more control over your chariot than it does. Plenty of blocking and screwage. I was hoping that this one would be more fun that a typical dice driven race game since you get to control how far you move on your turn with a deck of cards that have movement points on them. But in practice it really didn't make all that much difference. If you go first it is usually fairly easy to get to the choke points first. In the times I played this it seemed that the players finished in the same order they started. That's awesome! It means I can play this game in less than a minute and I don't need to own the game! Note that this is for the newer version of the game.

RATING: 6
Production value is great in this simple race game. Play cards, manage them well enough to makei through the race, stay close to the wall, watch chokepoints and remember to pit stop with Caesar.  Pretty simple. Like it but not well enough to own it. 

Needs combat or somtheing else going on to make this a winner.

Very quick chariot racing game.  I'm not sure how much strategy there is here, other than draw the right cards at the right time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A very interesting racing game that uses cards numbered one through six instead of dice. The key is that everyone has the same set number of cards, so everyone is going to be able to move the exact number of spaces, that is unless other players block them from using their full move. It's fast paced, easy to learn, handles a large amount of players, and has short play times making it one of my favorite fillers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting race game that I would play again. With everyone having the same cards availible and deciding how/when they use them, it allows for some nasty play and some great "on no!" moments.

I've been disappointed with other chariot race games, but this one has got the right combination of racing, blocking and screwage; unlike, say, Arena Maximus, the game never feels like it is dragging. A great game I'm really looking forward to playing more.

Great with 5-6 players.  You need to play all 4 rounds to even things out or at least 2.  I have the earlier Ravensburger edition, and my friends prefer that edition.

Lots of good natured screwage. Block the lane and then slow down.  Need to try with kids.  With the simple concepts I think that this would be a hit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Hand management, simpler than Snow Tails (which I'd played first) so this came off a little worse in the comparison. As long as people play their cards quickly this is fine, but it doesn't do so well with a lot of thought before each card play.

6/17/07 - As a six player game this game truly shines.  You can learn it in a minute and it plays in about thirty.  Not a lot of choices in this game, but it relies more on a fun/screw factor rather than a game of strategy.  That doesn't mean the game is devoid of strategy, rather the way you play your limited cards can have a great impact on your and others game plans.   A lot of fun!

Have a few game under my belt, but most ended before they finished, usually after the third race.  4 races on two maps is just too long for such a simple game.  I mean, it is very accessible and fun with right crowd and not-so-heavy gamers, but I would rather play many other games before this one.

RATING: 7.5
I think I would like this game more if I were able play it with a larger group more often. But when we are able to put a larger group together, there are other games that we'd rather play.

However, this is one game that my almost 4 year old loves playing with me. When I introduced him to it, I think we played it 5 times in a row. I had the rating lower, but I bumped it up when me and my boys started having fun with it together.

When I explain the rules to people, they look at me like I have just asked them to play the war card game because it seems so simple.  Then, as they play, they begin to realize that there are tactics and the ultra simple game is a lot of fun.  I think it's really only good with 5 or 6.

After 3 years of no plays, I played this with my wife and kids and we really enjoyed it.  It's a nice family game that works well with different ages.  I have dropped my 7 rating I've given it, but I'll check that out again after a few to a 5.5.

A simple but tense race game in which you have just barely enough movement points to finish the race so efficiency and timing are key.  I'm not very fond of racing games but this one is short enough and light enough to be tolerable, and it doesn't overstay it's welcome like Formula De.  That said, I think that I prefer the related car race game Ausgebremst.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
fast moving racing game with a serious blocking element that gives it a competitive edge. Clever mechanic of making you "pull in to the pits" to pay tribute to Caesar and being able to be prevented from doing so means that this game is not as simple as it looks. Everyone has a range of cards numbered 1-6, which shows the spaces you can move in your turn. Pick the right card from your hand of 3, you can be completely blocked by other players, which can waste moves - the cards are just enough to get you round the 3 laps, so you cannot afford to be blocked too much or too long.

Neat.

Light chariot racing game - heart of the game is hand management, and playing cards to 'block' your opponents or better forcing them to take the long route and hopefully not finish the race. Best to play the cut-throat version where you can't wait in a line for your 'pit-stop'.

Quick, and surprisingly fun, great filler that everyone seems to enjoy.

I own the old Ravensburger edition. After reading several reviews on both the old and new version, I decided to spend my $ 45 on the old edition and got one from Germany.This is a great game for both kids and adults. The biggest fun is that you can play this with your kids and everybody has a chance of winning, yet it's not because of dumb luck that you win this. It takes about 15 minutes to do a 3 lap race which is great because that's about the attention span my youngest (5 years) has.The other day I played it with adults only and it's still a lot of fun and all players enjoyed this game. It's fun to see all adults screaming to the guy in the lead "YOU CAN'T PLAY A SIX WHEN YOUR ARE IN THE LEAD!!!

Very light but fun racing game. 
Draws its attraction from the fact, that player order is clockwise, not following the position in the race.
This and the design of the tracks offers a lot of blocking opportunities.

Lots of fun, cruel, light-hearted filler type game - good fun!

Absolutely best with 5 or 6 players.  I would rate it 7 with 4 players and 6 with fewer.

This is not a bad game, I was expecting it to be very good, and when I got it I was slightly disappointed.  I wonder whether this has something to do with the track I have, I have read that the new track isn't as fun/harsh as the old track... nonetheless, a simple game system and with 5 or 6 players can be a real blast to play.

Thenew edition artwork and production value is just stunning.  Very nice pieces and the board is gorgeous.

Light game with almost no strategy involved.  Sort of like watching TV.  Nice game to play after something heavy.

Its major problem is that turn order is ridiculously important.  In a 6 player game, the end result is largely pre-ordained by start order.  It would be nice if there was a way to tweak the game to give players starting last a chance to catch the leaders.

I prefer the original Ravensburger version where players can actually run out of cards and not finish the race.

RATING: 6.5
Fun, mindless racing game. Strategy is minimal, choices are limited, and the winner is usually the one who just happened to have the right cards at the right time. But the game is still lots of fun: you really do feel like you're neck-and-neck with the other players, and the ending is always close. Throwing your coin is a blast, and the game is short enough that we usually want to play again right away.

I'm not sure why I like this game so much.  The theme, awesome bits, and gameplay all mesh for me into a very enjoyable experience.  It's a fun, light game with some good player interaction.  One drawback is that the two tracks become old after repeated plays (needed a few expansions!). The "screw your opponents" style of play doesn't appeal to some.

Simply wonderful. The trick to enjoying this to the max is to be gratuitously nasty to your opponents at all times - great fun.  And it plays so quickly there's always time for revenge in a second game, and perhaps a third.  Essen is usually about new games but this remains a highlight of 06 for me.  Many thanks to Mik Svellov for his masterclass which introduced us to the game.

I've played this a few times and I must admit that the big collector's premium for this game has me stumped. Where is the game here? Is there one at all? Or do you just play cards and move around the track? Honestly, I could not identify where the skill was. I don't demand that my games always be dominated by skill, but I do prefer it when there is some. Also, Ave Caesar is very repetitive. You're doing more or less the same thing over and over, with a fairly narrow range of tactical problems. There just isn't enough variety to make the game at all engaging.

However, I will admit that it's a good game for a mixed group of adults and younger kids.

RATING: 8
This is the best short racing game in my opinion!

It's fast, has dead simple rules, plays 3-6 (4+ is definitely better, the more the merrier) and always makes you curse your friends when they block you!

It's a very easy game to explain and play, but there is actually some strategy involved, and even though it's not a whole lot, an experienced player will win more than 50 % of the times (but not like 90 % which is probably the case with most eurogames). 

I like how you can position your horse in a way that blocks your opponents, making them take a detour or maybe even skip a whole turn.

The rule about you cannot play a 6 when in front is a must as it's part of what makes the game interesting! You don't want to be in front too early, and definitely not in the end if you still have a 6 in your hand - then you're guaranteed to lose as you cannot move if you're in the lead and only have 6's in your hand! Oh I cannot count how many times I've seen a player lose because of this. Or if you run out of cards the space before the finishing line because you have been forced to take a lot of detours - great fun!

I also like the sillyness of having to shout out AVE CAESAR and deliver your coin - otherwise you cannot win! It also happens almost all the time that one or two players are blocked and have to wait a turn to deliver the coin; but maybe they will get blocked again and cannot win. 

I've played this game close to 50 times, which is a lot for me! However, it's just plain and simply a geat filler - it takes about 15 minutes to play for us, so when I'm together with a certain group of friends and we order pizza, we always manage to get in a game of this before picking them up - hence, Ave Caesar is known as "the pizza game" in this group.

In Denmark (yes, it's probably played that way in most of Denmark), we play with slightly altered rules which make the game even better, more strategic and meaner! 

Ave Caesar is a game I highly recommend as it's a great filler (which my rating also indicates; while it's a good rating, it's obviously not because I want to play Ave Caesar just as much as I want to play other "real" games that I've rated the same, but as a filler it's great). 
However, you need to pick up the old Ravensburger edition as the new edition has a shorter map. This new map makes it almost impossible not to reach the finishing line which in turn means that the game becomes much less interesting as blocking and hence detours are devaluated. Also, the graphics in the new edition is confusing as there are many disputes about whether a certain space is a space or not etc.

Go get it (the old version), it's worth it.

I quite liked this game. It is almost roll a D6 and move that number of spaces but the track is well designed and it does have some tension. The critisism of one player was that you don't really have to think or make descions on your turn, which is true. Relaxing, quick and a great alternative to the likes of Snakes and Ladders or Candyland for children I'd guess.

Plays quickly, almost like a filler, with light but often meaningful decisions. Dependable light fun, not a rock star but a keeper that will see a lot of plays.

This is a light, cut-throat racing game. Works best with 6 players, for maximum jostling and blocking. 

Sure, there is a bit of luck...but the game plays quickly and has plenty of opportunity to screw over an opponent. The brevity is what allows this game to be a winner. It provides a good laugh and some excitement, and comes to an end before you start to get into any monotony. 

I'd gladly play this one any time its suggested, and would consider picking up a copy.

Q-Jet Version (Original Ave Board)

This is a rather light racing game, where you decisions from turn to turn are largely straight forward. You have a hand of 3 cards, at all times drawn randomly from the deck, and the idea is to win the race of 3 laps, while still taking the time to pit (hail Caesar) somewhere in there. The board in the original version of the game (Ravensburger Ave / Q Jet) is rather challenging, and being forced to the outside just a couple of times is enough to make it very difficult to actually finish the race. 

The challenge aside, I don't think I am actually playing the game so much as I am simply reacting to what is in my hand. The choices are all rather straight-forward: you want to get inside if you can, if not, you want to block off intersections and choke the other players down whenever the opportunity is there. It is clearly not intended to be anything more than a light diversion, but just be aware of these factors if you're thinking about buying the game.

As of 2008, this game is obsolete for me. Snow Tails does everything this game is trying to, but adds decision points and a variable course. I could not imagine playing this game in the post-Snow Tails world.

So simple, you'll think "this is really stupid".  But play it and you'll be cursing, cheering, and laughing.  It's very, very light and really doesn't have anything to do with chariot racing (witness the rethemes) but it's also extremely accessible and kinda mean with a full field.  It's nowhere near the game that Circus Maximus (or even Arena Maximus) is, but it's not bad at all.

Nice game, and I like the extra maps out there.  After playing Daytona 500, this feels lighter and slightly less interesting.  If D500 had alternate tracks I would probably prefer it slightly.  update: During my last game with four people the NPC chariot won.  It doesn't feel like there are more than a few obvious choices to be made.  We played with the ramming and whipping rules.  Great components and pretty board.

Simple, fun race game.  Great game for the family, easy for the kids to pick up.  The leader will generally stay ahead if she has the cards to block the path or to consistently force her opponents to take the outside track, but the card draw can even things out a bit if a run of low numbers is drawn.  We've only played with 3 so far (without "dummy chariots" to make things more interesting) - would like to see how it plays with more.  You definitely need to play at least 2 if not more racing cycles in order to even out the leader advantage and scoring.
I've heard that the track from a previous version makes the game more interesting - I believe there is a file here to download that track.  Will have to try.
Edit:  Now that I've played the superior Snow Tails, I'll have to downgrade the rating on this one.  This is still a good race game for kids and family, but Snow Tails outshines it in almost every way.  Still haven't tried the alternate tracks, though.

Update: finally bought this used for $20. After playing again, I think I paid too much. Or maybe I need to look into uploaded boards, which I think I heard exist...

Only played with 4 so far. Certainly more enjoyable for than Formula De (too much dice, too much counting ahead for the perfect move = boring). Bonus points for being simple, but it's almost too simple for a board game. With only 3 cards to choose from every turn, turns seem usually pretty obvious.

A silly racing game in the spirit of Formula Dé and Top Race. Play a card, move your chariot the appropriate amount of spaces, move through one annoying obstacle to get rid of a coin, and be the first to cross the finish line. Although Ave Caesar plays very quickly, it isn't much of a challenge. Now the fact that everyone owns a draw stack means that the luck of the draw evens out to a nice extent, but what card to play doesn't require much thought. It's probably more fun if you play with children.

Lo que comentaba en la nueva edición que debes jugarla con una carta de valor 6 menos, es erróneo por mi parte, y eso que hice testeo. Lo que hice yo al final fué añadir una casilla más a ambos tableros por la que se pase siempre en las 3 vueltas y jugar con todos los seises, personalmente cogí una casilla y la partí en dos.

A very light game with very little strategy. The limit of three cards in your hand makes it very much a case of making the best of opportunities as they arise. It is, however, a lot of fun. Very much a frivilous, fun exciting game meant to be enjoyed.

All but two playes have been of Q-Jet 21xx.  Good racing game with lots of screwage groans.  Without a doubt, I like the Q-Jet version better.  While it's production values are poorer, it's board is less confusing as far as what is a space and what isn't.  The design of the track with the overpass and the multi-folds in the Ave Caesar board lead to unnecessary confusion in what really is a simple game.

I love games that encourage players to shout.  The requirement to salute Caesar essentially demands a shout of "Ave Caesar" from each player during the game.  This game also works great with six players, another reason to love it.

Light, fast and fun... you can't go wrong!  At first it seems like the game is fairly random and lucky, but once you start to play you discover there are at least a few core strategies to focus on.  It is very possible to play this game well or poorly.  You have to be planning three moves ahead or you can really get yourself in trouble!

Very light chariot racing game. Choose one of three visible movement cards, each turn, from a hand of 24. Simply attempt to block opponents by getting the inside line and blocking at bottlenecks. Fun and simple, but luck can be a major factor. Multiple tracks, forward and reverse, and sectioned make for a bit of variety. Good, fast filler, although you have to play mutliple races to be fair.

A bit too light, but a strangely addictive chariot racing game.

I actually own both version of the game (Ravensburger/Pro Ludo) but not much differs between them. If I had to chose I'd go for the Ravensburger version.

Update: Sold off my Pro Ludo version. Prefer the old one.

RATING: 7
Surprisingly engaging for such a simple game, the magic is in the timing of blocking and the short play length.  Gleefully screwing your neighbor is at its best in a short game and this one delivers.  Huge thumbs up for the Roman theme from my camp.  Rating is limited by the fact that it lacks short-term replayability and can't be an evening's entertainment.

RATING: 5
This is a fun little 6-player race game, but there are absolutely no decisions to be made.  Your three card hand and the placement of the other racers dictate exactly what the one move you can make is.  Since everything is so dictated by the card draw, this game is essentially War, with a cool theme.

Much like Detroit/Clevland Grand Prix.  I liked it quite a bit, but wow is turn order important.  Maybe we got a rule wrong about turn order...but assuming we didn't, I don't think I can rate it higher than a 6.  It's a perfect game to fill in the "6 player" category though.

RATING: 7
Simplistic race game with stunning components.  Players run a deck of 24 race cards, and play from a mini-hand of three cards.  Cards advance your chariot around the track and you must try to take the shortest route possible as you have just enough points to reach the finish line.  Dirty tactics abound, howls of laughter and anguish.  Not a lot of strategy but great fun.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not quite as many opportunities for clever plays as I had hoped, and it is fairly luck based compared to Snow Tails which is my favourite racing game. However this game plays quicker and is much easier to teach, which means it is more accessible for non-gamers.

RATING: 7
A family fun game with a very simple game mechanic: cards instead of dice. Nice artwork. Can be a very simple but highly competitive game, even for adults who just want something easy to learn (in seconds in fact) but you can extend play using the tournament mode, which is recommended but not necessary. A true gem which I got for my little kids, that all ages enjoy to play. No set up required to speak of. You'll start play 5 minutes after you open the box.

I would want to play this game to compare it too Winner's Circle.

Finally played Ave Caesar. I did enjoyed playing Ave Caesar. There is a difference between Winner's Circle and Ave Caesar. Although, I don't think Ave Caesar is worth the price tag it is selling. It should be cheaper. There is not that much in the game.

You play cards with numbers around the track. You got 3 cards in your hand and have to play one per turn, than draw a another card to keep you hand at three. In some situation, you can use your low cards to block
your opponent to slow him down. Fun when you do it to your opponent, frustrating when it's done to you.

Good, fun game for non-gamers. Repetitive, low down time and plays fast.

wow. very much a mediocre game. if you have the right cards at the exact moment you will 
do well, otherwise it's entirely luck dependent and predetermined positional outcomes based on
seating. (due to narrow track-very hard to pass and make up for starting in the rear)
All of which would be ok in a short game, but playing 4 races is WAY too long for what there is.
very much inferior to the Kramer race series.

(Original Ravensburger edition) This is a fun game if you don't take it too seriously.  Players can get totally screwed by bad card draws and other circumstances that are totally beyond their control.  Thankfully, the game moves along quickly, so even if you're constantly getting hosed, you won't have to suffer long.  IMHO the advanced Ausgebremst deck-arranging rules seem to work best with the actual Ausgebremst game - it's best to forego them here, and just enjoy Ave Caesar as a quick and easy filler.

Ave Caesar is a very light game. It is also fun and plays quickly. If you are taken aback by the simplicity and lack of strong decisions then this may not be the game for you. You choose how many spaces you will move by playing one of three cards from your hand. There are a few options for how to move, with lanes and bottlenecks, but not many.

If those things do not concern you then you are likely to enjoy this light racing game. They certainly didn't bother me. The one thing I missed = no ramming other chariots. It is a very respectable chariot race and I wanted (a little) carnage.

The mechanic of not being able to play a 6 if in the lead is nice and having to honor Caesar gives this game a different feel to formula die, but its still a racing game and I have to be convinced to play.

On the plus side the board is beautiful.

I've played the new Pro Ludo edition and it is very nice. The cards are excellent, the chariots and coins are just like the originals and the tracks are drawn very well. However, the track design seems weaker than the original. Maybe they wanted something simpler to comprehend, but it does seem to lack the sharp edge of the original design. Still, it's well worth getting and still great fun. A must buy game.

Absolute classic chariot race, spend big money to obtain this game. Cut-throat very fast card based race, simple choices, but the chance to be utterly ruthless to win. Hilarious.

This is a crazy chariot race.  Another simple, almost obvious game play -- we each have a deck of cards with numbers (1 to 6).  Play a card, move than many spaces.  The track expands and contracts, and bottleneck points can cause congestion.  Knowing when to hang back and then burst forward is key.  VERY fun.  Playing with all six players is just amazing.  The bits are wonderful.  I wish the smallest spaces on the track were big enough to fit the chariots; some are not.  I know the ones in front of Caesar are there to pay tribute, so we turn the chariot sideways and wave to him, but some on the track are too small to fit the bits.  BESIDES THAT (and that is a TINY little criticism) the game has basically no flaws.  Quick to learn, quick to play, satisfyig bits, often painful, lots of screwage.  Perfect.

An alright calculational, tactical race game.  The strategy seems apparent, play the highest card you have if you can and stick to the inside.  I am convinced luck has more to do than any real decision making.  Blocking seems to be an issue of chance more than design, and it is the only aspect of the game that elevates it beyond draw a card and play.  Maybe the Asmodee/Pro Ludo reprint doesn't do the original Ravensburger game much justice with it's new courses, or maybe this game truly needs the full compliment of players to truly work, but Ave Caesar doesn't live up to a lot of the love it gets.

(Acquired December 2006) - (Update March 2008) I enjoy this game. Although the rules are simple and it plays quickly, it can be very challenging with a large group (we play with 7 players). Having just a little more movement points than are required to finish the race makes it very challenging.

May 2009 -- I always enjoy this game, although we play it only occasionally.

Ocotber 2011 -- This is still a fun game for us. We take turns selecting games for our game days, and I often pick this one. It is simple to learn and play, and the game time is short, so it fits our group well.

2013-November: We played this again recently and enjoyed it as much as ever.

I am not the biggest racing game fan, but this is a fun one.  It's fun, light, and quick.  Also, it feels good to mess with people.  Who knew that the Romans were so wacky with the chariot race tracks!  This isn't a game I would want to play a lot, but it makes for a great intro game or filler.  Some really nice production values on the Asmodee version.  The board artwork is great, and the chariots look and feel excellent.  My minor quibble is that there is plenty of air in the box, so here's hoping they did that on purpose for storage of future expansion tracks in there.  :)

Okay, it's pretty fluffy - quick, straightforward, with a generous amount of luck. However, there is at least a small amount of tactical interest, and the game is absolutely gorgeous. It rates well, so long as it's judged for what it is - a quick, non-taxing filler that non-gamers can be talked into playing.  I like Ave Caesar slightly better than the longer and more tactically interesting but less visually appealing formula racing version, Ausgebremst.

But I must deduct a point for its poor handling of a large table of players. This game *should* be best with 5 or 6 players. Unfortunately, the players in the back of the pack have a rather hopeless race ahead of them.

A very simple racing game. I believe there is a turn order benefit to going first that isn't mitigated... but it is fun with new players (as long as *they* go first). "Keep in mind that the game designers advice is to play more than one race and let players start in the reverse order of the previous race. By doing this, the starting order advantage evens out."

When I play racing game I want them to move quickly, have some screwage and just be fun. This game has that going for it, while still having some strategy (blocking and the rule that deny the first player to play their best card). Like the game Formula D, more tracks are probably needed for it since I think they can get old after a few plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Light-weight to be sure but satisfying in a breezy sort of way. Strategy appears to be limited to managing your three-card hand, and looking for opportunities to jam up the track for the guys behind you. I suppose you could count cards in your deck to better anticipate what moves might come up but why bother, really? Just lay 'em and play 'em. A decent game to play with kids, but its popularity with adults is somewhat hard to fathom. Eventually traded after even my kids failed to warm to it.

Tried with 6 players, and the screwage factor increased immensely...but the frustration of not being able to move for 3 or 4 turns in a row, and not being able to do a thing about it, doesn't rate as a positive. Feeling reinforced by another 6 player game, rating drops 1/2 point.

Game is nicely made, with attractive art, neat chariots.  Gameplay is fun, fast, but not terribly deep.  Probably best with families and when you just want something light and thematic.

There is a little bit of hand management, in that a variety of move cards is good to try and maintain.  There are also places to cut people off, mostly in the bottle necks, or to block the faster routes. That gives you a little bit of decision making.  I.E. do I block everyone, or take the lead?

It looks like a racing game. It feels like a racing game. But there is this one mechanic that, while beeing necessary to balance the game, makes this game just a boring cardgame: The leader must not play a 6. Because one cannot finish without playing them, a start-goal victory is impossible. To win, one has to slow down, and let others pass by. This just does not feel right.

Ave Caesar is a quick-playing and very basic race game. It forgoes many of the conventions of typical race games such as taking turns based on position, managing the condition of your race vehicle, etc. and mainly focuses on blocking. 

Each player gets a deck of cards with numbers 1-6 on them. Play a card from your hand of three, move the number of spaces shown on the card, draw a replacement. That is your whole turn. Tactics generally involve blocking the single-space-wide spots so that others are forced to pass their turns and you can go again. Unfortunately, blocking when you are not in first place often just exacerbates the runaway leader problem. This is mitigated somewhat by not allowing the first place player to use 6 value cards, but it's still by far the best place to be. 

The general consensus seems to be that the tracks are more interesting on the Ravensburger edition, but that one is very hard to find. The graphics on the new edition are pretty though, and the plastic chariots and coins are hefty and detailed. 

I'm happy to play this, but it really is of very light weight. What TransAmerica is for train games, Ave Caesar is for race games. Good for mixed groups of gamers and non-gamers, or with kids. Most serious gamers will want to play a different race game though.

I suppose a lot of the criticisms of this game are justified. But I find Ave Caesar to be exactly what it's designed to be. Yes, it's fairly luck-driven. But it's supposed to be a light, quick game. So my rating is not based on Ave Caesar's merits compared to other games, but in achieving its purpose in my collection. Playing a 6 in the last turn, blowing by the guy in front of you to cross the finish line first...satisfying.

A blocking game where one can be forced to skip multiple turns as player after player blocks you in (oh joy!), where the designer felt the need to implement a mechanic which forces the leader to change (leader may not play any 6 value cards), so leading throughout the race is not possible.

In my last game, the leader had to wait a few turns while the 2nd player caught up, as he could not play any of his THREE "6"s... It's sad when the play of a single card would secure the win, but because you can't play a 6, you have to wait two turns for a player to pass you, then he/she plays again to win, and you finish 2nd or 3rd...  Way too artificial for my tastes.

One needs to manage his cards (hand of three) as you have just about enough to go around the track three times.  If you always take the outside/long route, then forget it as you won't have enough cards to make it.  Feels too much like a Knizia game....

An interesting mechanic, but for me it does not work in a race setting as it is way too artificial.  And the price was outrageous for what you get.

This game is baaad.  Strategy is simple, with the most important things to do being blocking and not getting blocked.  Of course it sucks to get blocked, and I don't even have fun blocking other people.  So there's nothing here that is fun for me.  And the strategies are pretty straightforward, so it really comes down to luck.  Finally, the board is designed in such a way that the chariots don't always fit in the squares, which is just freaking stupid.

First played July 5th, 2007.  This is a quick teach (<5min) and quick play (~30min for 4).  Some may get into the "Hail Ceasar" requirement and others may mumble.  This is more of a race compared to Arena Maximus which is more of a take-that game.  You can do some blocking.  The goal is to use your cards to race around the course 3 times without running out of cards and beating your opponents.  Don't forget to stop and say hi to Ceasar or you're out of the race.  It's a fun game that I'd recommend giving a game play.  There isn't as much strategy in it as I felt like there could be however.  The blocking gives me the impression that it's more about luck having the right cards at the right time.  Oh yeah, if you're in the lead, there is a rule that you can't play a "6" is most cases which is good since it won't let someone run away with it.  Movements are 1-6.

Ave Caesar is a quick and dirty, simple racing game.  At first glance I was skeptical since the initial race I participated in ended up in starting order minus one change.  However, later races proved to be more cutthroat with ten times the thrills and spills as players would throw themselves to the mercy of the movement deck.  Blocking is generally pretty easy to do, so the game is more about gauging when to move in for the Ave Caesar or hold off until a more opportune time as well as deciding when to hold up the masses behind you or cut loose away on the outside portions of the tracks.  All in all, it's a nice, fast game for almost everybody.

Racing all the way!  Quick to explain and quick to play.  Sure it's got luck, but it's also got chrome.

I'm glad I own it, but it does feel somewhat like candyland.  There's not *that* many decisions to be made in this game.

After a few playings though, it just didn't seem like anything you did mattered.  The leader hardly ever got passed and nothing interesting happened.

RATING: 7
Ancient Roman circus-racing game.  Players get the choice of 3 cards showing movement distances, which gives nice flexibility but your path can be blocked by the other players meaning you don't move at all!  This mechanic is perhaps slightly family unfriendly but I don't think it detracts from an otherwise fast-paced, exciting and nerve-wracking racing game.

Upon seeing that the game is for 2-6 players, I really wouldn't recommend this for a 2 player game.  The blocking of your opponents is the main attraction, and outside of that the game is just turning cards over so I don't think the 2 player game would involve much strategy (or excitement).

Definitely recommend for a light and quick game, suitable for children also.

I loved this game back in the day, then I bought the Cafe Press edition and I found that the game as falling kinda flat whenever I brought it out.

RATING: 4
Sadly not as good as I expeccted.  I really thought it would be as good as Detroit/Cleveland but the opprotunity for vindictive blockage is beyond rampant here.  At least in all the deviations on this theme you can tend to get people out of the way in a 5 turn period.  I had a race happen where I was stuck behind somebody for 6 turns and went from 12 spaces ahead of last place to 25 spaces behind the final winner due to the way the turns played out.That shows poor balance in the design.  I'll probably stick to the better variants or play with a house rule forbidding someone from blocking more than 2 turns in a row (ie you have to pull off to the side to let traffic pass)Original Ave Ceasar Version

RATING: 5
I clump this together with Royal Turf and Daytona 500 as all three are roughly the same weight and all are similar type race games (the others have a little more but not that much really). Where the other two disappointed me this game did not and that was solely on expectations, here I knew what to expect where as I was hoping for a little more out of the other two due to the creators. 

This is a good light little race game with a nice dose of screwage, there are enough choke points that cutting people off will certainly happen, especially with more players. Decisions are very obvious, you choose to play one of your three cards to move your chariot and the choice is usually a no-brainer but the game is fun for what it is.  While everyone has the same cards the time they come to you is very luck based and it will largely determine your fate as will turn order, it can also be quite hard to catch the leader.

2 races of 3 laps is enough for this or it will wear out its welcome and occasional play best as well, best played as a filler.

RATING: 4.1
Very easy to learn, very simple and fast to play...almost too simple. In our 3-player game, no one ever ran out of cards, it wasn't even close! It basically came down to who had the high cards in their hand at the end of the third lap.  I was a little disappointed about the game after all the hype this game has received over the years.

RATING: 2
A nonstop screw-fest, with loss of turns.  Not only does the style of game piss me off, but there are very few interesting decisions in it - usually the best move is obvious, and whether you make that move is determined by which cards you're holding.  Compare to Citadels, which is also a screw-fest with loss of turns, but actually gives the players interesting choices like which role to pick and which building to build.

Under no circumstances will I play this game again.

RATING: 5
Fun racer with lots of blocking opportunities. The enforced pit stop makes it feel like a car racer more than a chariot game.

Two six-player plays only, docked a point for the inlfuence that start position has on the result with that number of players. To win you need to start in the first three, if you start last you can consider a fifth place finish an achievement.

Because of this it's suggested that you play a few games in a session to balance this out. I'm just not convinced that there's enough here to make me want to play it three or four times in a row, so for me at least probably better with a smaller group.

Kind of difficult to get to the table because several people in my group don't care for it.

Enjoyable and very light race game. I found it managed to introduce some welcome "tension" and remain very light at the same time. I particularily like the requirement to hail Caesar before the race is out to avoid summary execution.

I think this is better than Formula De in a couple of ways. Most importantly, each player in Ave Caesar has an identical deck to draw movement cards. This prevents large discrepancies in the number of spaces different players move in the game. While one can get and hold a lead in Ave Caesar, there is never a breakaway winner.

Secondly, Ave Caesar is simpler than Formula De. The simplicity makes for a faster game; and "fast" is what everybody wants in a race game, right?

I haven't played the newer version, so I can't comment on the track differences.  This is a great light game and must be played quickly and in the right spirit.  The race is first and foremost about blocking your opponents - the biggest joy is seeing someone miss multiple turns in a row.  I'd be interested in trying some of the numerous variants, but the base game is more than adequate - extremely easy to learn, high component quality and a lot of guaranteed laughs.  It should be noted that any downtime caused by AP would completely kill the game.

This is a bad racing game. The only good thing I can say about it is that its very simple and fast. Unfortunately, this is because nearly all your decisions are made for you, and your choice of card each turn is very obvious. Also the starting player advantage is excessive.

It's okay but gets a bit boring after a while. I don't want to play multiple games after eachother so usually the player who starts will win the game unless he's very unlucky with the cars he draws.

This is a great family game or with friends over who may not play a lot of games. There are only about 6 rules to the game and yet, it has a bit more skill in it than one would casually observe. The switching directions on the tracks is a great idea and makes for 4 different races. The more people the better. Really, the minimum should be 4. The lanes get clogged quickly with 6 and really makes the game more enjoyable. Happy racing!

Based on one play; six-player game.  We only played one race (supposed to run three races) because everyone had enough after one.  It was interesting but I could see where running three races would get old pretty fast.  I think six players probably made it a lot more fun.  This was a potential buy for me but now that I've played it I don't think I'll buy it.

I think it's pretty clever and fun... but it's very very simple, almost to the point that I'm afraid of offending my friends like do I think they're stupid or something?

It has to be played fast.  One player who sits and slowly figures out his move will really spoil the mood and ruin the experience.

It seems like it's rare that anyone ever wants to actually play the whole four rounds. :(  I guess it's not really a hit.

Great theme and playing pieces  make this game.  However, this game is biased towards whoever moves earlier in the sequence.  "Serious" racers may get frustrated.  Some folks like Ausgebremst because of the added complexity (four stacks of cards representing gears).  I didn't find Ausgebrmest as charming, and didn't care for the fiddely set up it required.  I encourage you to try Ave Caesar - its fun!

People with the most movement points there never won a race.

A quick-ish filler, favors the starting player unless he/she draws a really crappy initial hand. Not much game here, you might have 1-2 turns in a game where the choice isn't obvious. Maybe, just maybe, this could be better with a few beers and some spare change for bets, if the balance issues can somehow be dealt with.

UPDATE: Top Race took this in exactly the right direction, rendering Ave Caesar obsolete. The first-second players' edge is so huge the game is borderline broken.

Easier than Monopoly yet you race Roman Chariots!  Plus, you're not stuck with playing 'the shoe'.  Fun, super easy game that is great for killing small bits of time.  I hope this gets reprinted, as it costs a fortune now.

Racing game. The funniest part is when you stand up and shout Ave Caesar after passing Caesar. Get the old game! The new reprint isen't as good. The old board is better and you have fewer cards, so you have to plan more carefully than in the new.
Edit: 
I only play this game at conventions, so I sold the game, so it can be played more often. It has found a very good home (sold to Natasha).

I really like the theme, the mechanics and the fact you have the choice of 2 tracks which is not that bad. The only problem, that I am not sure because I have not played enough, is that the game seems broken. It seems that if one of the first player start with an high card like an 5 or a 6, he is going to win at the end of the game.

[I own and prefer the Q-Jet 21xx edition with 2-sided board.]

A short racing game that is very enjoyable, especially with 5 or 6.  You have just only so much value in each deck of cards, that it's just enough to get around the track but not enough to take the long routes too often (or you'll run out of cards).  The new Asmodee edition has nice production quality and the Q-Jet 21xx edition adds a bit more variety with the different track setups options and double-sided board.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fast, fun, racing game that is all about blocking your opponents and preferably forcing them to take the longer corners or cutting them off from pit row.  While there is definitely strategy in the game in choosing what speed card you use, the luck of the draw does come into the picture at times.  I also think its really difficult to catch a leader if you get off to a slow start unless the leaders block each other into using the outside lanes too often and falling short.

On its surface Ave Caesar is one of the simplist racing games you could ever hope to find. Play a card, move that many spaces. Repeat until you have been around the track x number of times. But really what lies beneath these simples rules is, I hate to say it, elegant. It plays incredibly fast with the lack of rules making it a great simulation of chariot racing, and the main drama in the game comes from positioning yourself in the most favorable spot, and setting yourself up for victory down the finish line. The added rule of having to stop and pay homage to Caesar is an interesting twist to the game, and sometime catches new players unaware until the last minute, which usually throws a wrench into their well laid plans. 

I highly recommend this as a great "gateway" game for your non-gaming friends, or partner. This one definitely shines when you are playing with all 6 players.

Great racing game (Especially with 5 or 6 players).  Set in the roman ampitheatre there is lots of bumping and blocking.  A very fun game as long as you can take the rough with the smooth.  I have 2 extra home printed boards giving more choice of tracks.

Chariot racing game during the Roman Empire.  Always as entertaining to the players as to the Emperor.  Pity that it is only available in German edition, though English rule is downloadable from internet. Too simple a game mechanic for my taste and it looks like the random nature of your card deck to move your chariot determines whether you win or not.  Little strategy I can see.

A lite racing game. My first play with gamers didn't go so well. Not enough to keep them entertained. My first play with non-gamers who like "take that" games was much more fun. Audience appears to be everything with this game.

Tried to trade it away, but got trader's remorse so ended up keeping it. It was a good decision in the short term, but I am thinking of trading again.

RATING: 9
(Ravensburger Version Rating 9) Puts the riot into chariot racing.  Boisterous, subservient to Caesar, vindictive, live fast die young.  A game where you need eyes in your back of your head.  This is a riot of a game that I think captures the spirit of the colisseum (If not the historical accuracy - a pit stop?!!).  A race game that I will look to play at every opportunity.

(Pro Ludo Version Rating 7) Suffers from the modern sins of gaming design; political correctness - everyone can get round with cards to spare, visual over practical - a river, unclear boundaries to some of the squares which only serve to confuse rather than increase enjoyment and finally not enough carnage.  But that might say more about me than the game.  Get the pro ludo version and print off the old boards from bgg.

When the instructions tell you there are just a few points extra in the cards, you would think there would be enough that you could finish a race right? Well there are enough points, but use them wisely, or your first game will end up like ours....with none of us finishing!

That being said, this game makes for a tight, strategic race, that's one part fun, one part screw your buddy.

For what it is, this is a clever, straight forward, and fun game.  I like the double sided map and how you use it forward and backward to make 4 different racetracks.  I also like the cumulative scoring based on finishing place.  I REALLY like the choke points so that you can cause your opponents to think and often utter hideous verbal phrases at you.  This game is GREAT if you have 5-6 really competitive players going at it who enjoy razzing and jabbing one another.  This game is terrible if you have 4 or fewer playes, or couples where they are courteous to each other, or if you have the focused-only-on-themselves player who does not attempt to hurt their opponents.  Horse racing is not for nice people.  It's for little people.  Small people.  People who are emotional jockeys (size-wise) when it comes to kindness and letting others go first.  This game was fun when I played with cutthroat players.  The last 5 or so times I played it, I played with nice players, couples, or unattentive and dim-witted individuals who have cause my ranking of this game to plummet.

Fun race game. Blocking the opponents is essential to winning this one. This confrontational nature and the limitation of cards on the leader make for a fun race almost every time.

Light simple, euro race game. It like a very light version of the the Daytona 500 race games, where you move your guy by playing a card with a number on it. All about bunching people in the choke points on the track and pulling ahead. Really very little skill involved in playing this one.

The whole thing was a little lifeless for me. It gets a 4. There are plenty of better racing games out there.

This one didn't do much for me.  All players have the same deck, but it is completely luck driven as to which 3 cards you will have to use at any given time.  During my one play, I amassed a large lead and felt like I was playing a solo game.  The rules allowed for me to be caught towards the end, but I found myself not really caring too much as I couldn't really do anything about it.  Needs more options/variety to make it interesting - it's too vanilla for me.  Igel Argern is a much more fun race game in my opinion.

RATING: 8
Ave Caesar is a very light (think featherweight) racing game.  In it players will race their chariots three times around a course, which is laid out on the board.

Up to six chariots can participate in a race.  Each player has their own identical deck of cards.  Chariots move according to numerical values on cards played.  So, on a player's turn they play a card and move their chariot as many spaces as the card indicates.  That's it.

However, within that simple framework there is strategy to be had.  There are natural choke-points on the track.  Occupying the space of one of these choke-points will jam everyone up behind.  So, when possible you want to limit your opponents' options.  Also, there's only enough points in each deck to just make it through the course.  If players stick to the outside of the track all the time they will run out of movement points before they cross the finish line.

Before contestants cross that line for the last time they must stop before the Emperor, throw their special coin, and holler, "AVE CAESAR!"  Otherwise, they cannot win the event, even if they finish first.

Ave Caesar is a fun romp of a game.  The more people you get together to play, the better the game becomes.  This is due to the increasing challenge as more chariots jockey for position along the way.

Ave Caesar is--and there's no kind way to say it--a bad game. Move to a blocking position if you can. Otherwise, move along the inside track (or larger squares that allow you to move further). Lather, rinse, repeat.

It's boring and trivial. At least it's mercifully short. Not short enough, though. The optimal playing time for this game would be zero minutes. I take that back. Optimal playing time is minus 20 minutes. It's so bad it should add time to your life as reparations for being such a massive suck.

I played this with four zany, smart guys--not smart enough to avoid this game, but still smart--and even so the experience was exactly like being turned inside out and used as a wash rag in Paris Hilton's bathroom.

For such a classic race game I was suprised that there wasn't more interaction and chances to block out the other racers.

Still, it's a short, light racing game and I'd give it another try soon to see if I'm missing something.

This is a light game wherein players race chariots around a course by playing cards from their hands.  All players start out with identical decks of cards, which makes the game extremely well balanced, and the board is filled with multiple points where players can block (or otherwise screw) other players, adding tactics to the game.  

This is far, far removed from your boring American-style roll-and-move racing game.  This game is great for playing with non-gamers, but also should be nice when a group of gamers wants a break from brain-burning games.  The game is very short (

RATING: 8
I really liked this game; the rules are very simple, but the gameplay is pretty darn fierce.  This is one of those games that you can play on one level with kids, and an entirely different level with adults.  

The only thing that's missing is being able to take out your opponent, but that's what Circus Maximus is for.

(EDIT:  Feb 6, 2007):  After having played this game quite a few more times, my wife and I have found that we really like the game a lot.  A friend (who wins most of the time) has taken to saluting me by saying "Ave Caesar!" when we talk.

(EDIT:  April 3, 2007):  Like Mystery of the Abbey, this is one of those games where adding things like thematic music (Ben Hur or Gladiator Soundtracks, for example) really adds to the game.
There is no foolproof strategy to the game, since the cards equalize things so much.  This can also be a good game to try to count cards with, so you know what cards your opponent has left.

Great racing game.  Pretty quick and easy, a bit of luck (as almost all racing games are) and plenty of chances to screw your neighbor.  Would be a nine if I could figure out a way to attach spikes to the wheels of my little plastic chariot and force other drivers off the track.

I cannot actually believe that the discard pile is not allowed to be reshuffled once the draw deck runs out?! And your chariot is not allowed to finish the race if you do not have enough cards?! This must be one of the worst game mechanics I have ever come across. It reduces replayability to exactly 0.

Pretty nice racing game. The rule that the leader can't paly a six is just pure brilliance. Without that rule this would be unbearable since the player just starts at first place would finish first four times out of five. It is very hard to win if you get caught in a log jam early on in the race, but at the same you can lead the race all the way into the last corner and still finish outside of the podium.

An interesting twist on the racing game genre.  You have just a few extra movement points to complete the 3 laps needed to win the race.  It would be better to have more tracks.  I was a bit disappointed with the amount of stuff for the price.  The chariots are of excellent quality (as well as the cards and board) but it just doesn't seem to match the price.  I have the most recent reprint by Asmodee.  I'm sure more tracks can (and have been devised) that can be easily printed and played.  A more modular board (ala` Settlers) would have been a nice addition for this game.

Having owned "Circus Maximus" and "Arena Maximus," I really appreciate the simplicity of this design. At the same time it was obviously well thought out. The individual card deck idea was smart, in that it allows the game to move along quickly--which it should, being a race game--yet not make the moves too random, as would be the case if players were rolling one six-sided die, for example. I might have liked one rule about being able to bump or take out another chariot, but that obviously wasn't part of this design, and there's something to be said for having all players finish. At the same time, the competitive part of the race focuses on being able to get inside tracks, or cut out rivals at certain bottlenecks, denying them the ability to take a turn. There are only enough total moves for 3 laps on the cards, so one has to use them judiciously so as not to come up short at the finish line. This could be very fun with the right group and a few ales. Also, the graphics throughout are beautiful, as one would expect from Asmodee. The one question I have is whether there's a built-in advantage for who goes first, but also the rules dictate that the from one race to another the starting order for the next one is in inverse order. Definitely room for social interaction combined with trash talk and laughs. Playing an entire race sequence--maybe a total number of races equal to the number of participants--is the way to play this game in order to fully appreciate the design. Got my (non-gamer) family to play it, but they seemed indifferent after playing it, which suggests that maybe this game is going to work only with the right group--like, a bunch of guys with a 12-pack or so. Gotten in trade, October 2008.

50+ plays. A fun 20 minute romp that we've played a lot of over the years as a closer. We play a number of variants, including re-shuffle your deck if your bottom card is a 6, the whipping rule (play a 1 to swap positions with someone directly in front of you, with or without escalation), die if you play a 3 over water (for those who aren't concentrating, no takebacks), no diagonal moves unless there's clear space, and if you run out of movement points, you can move 1 space a turn until you finish - or until you get run down like a dog. Anyway, we've always had a ball of fun with it. Turns are quick, there's nearly always the option to pus someone in a lighthearted way, and be pus'd in return providing good laughs. Top-class closer for up to 6 people.

A full game of 4 races can get long, therefore a full game might be too long for what it is, unless all players play fast.

Acquired in trade 1/16/09. Played with a rowdy group this can be fun. Played with min-maxer Euro gamers, I tend to think "what's the point?" This game should be about beating on one another and trash talking. Without that element, you may want to try a race game with some more depth (Formula D?).

Played one game of three laps.  Light, quick racing game.  It had decent blocking and positioning with others.  Game came with two tracks, both interesting in their own way.

The game can be affected by cards drawn at specific times with others' positioning.  Game was meant to be played as multiple races, however I think over one race of three laps would be too long.  Game could use more tracks.

RATING: 5
Pleasant but not very interesting.  Just not enough factors to give it any depth or charcter.  Everyone I introduce it to says, "That was okay, what other games do you have?"  The premise is good - moving chariots around a racetrack and trying to cut each other off.  But that's the extent of the game.  It's a little too simplistic and uninteresting.  Maybe if chariot's were allowed to damage each other (a la "Ben Hur"), or there would be more terrain issues, or I don't know what, but it just lacks something.  If you're thinking about spending $30 plus shipping on this game, you're actually getting a game worth about $10 but with nice components.  It does not look like the photos below -- the game comes just as a flat board.

RATING: 6
(10+ plays)

A very nicely produced racing game that is designed for a nail biting finish.

On the minus side, everybody has the same deck that they will nearly exhaust, so if a player has all high cards in their last few, it can be brutal.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, as those players likely had the opportunity to stymie other chariots earlier in the game if they played their cards right... which means you really need to play with 5 or 6 players for this game to shine.  You can play with 2... but it just means the last few cards that were "undrawn" are likely to decide the game.

Meh.  Sorry Tom and Bruno, this game is not that great.  Granted I am the wrong audience as I am not a race fan, however, this was just dull.
I previously owned the Asmodee 2006 edition and although the production values were good the game play was boring.  1st player jumps to lead and stays there throughout race.  We never saw anyone ever run out of cards - even when using the "1" card bumping rules.  
Traded away and haven't missed it since.

*Almost* everything you want in a racing board game. Most importantly, it plays fast with very little downtime between turns.

Unfortunately, there is a huge last player disadvantage, which requires four different races to balance out this disadvantage. I think that's three races too long since you can't change the nature of subsequent races by what you have done in previous ones -- you are playing the same game four times, and I don't particularly like repetition.

Still looking for the great chariot racing game... play a card (numbered 1-6) from your hand of three then move your chariot accordingly... the track has some choke points, and chariots are forced to move the full amount or not at all... lacks an attack mechanic like Circus Maximus... so-so filler that plays fast, but the options are limited...

This is the game that I wanted Formula D to be. A fast circuit race for a big group of players that is all done inside half an hour. The blocking element is really fun and the traffic jams in the pit-lane add to the laughs. Sadly my set is missing a card (a bad trade...) but thankfully the game is still playable.

Filler that emulates the feeling of being in a race very well. Players must negotiate tight turning lanes, crowded curves, and a pitstop ("hail to Caesar") while moving along one of two tracks via (semi-) strategic card plays. Best with 6 players. Good change of pace.

I hate this game. The outcome is determined after the second round. The rest of the game is a true waste of time. The last two times I played this game, I wrote down my guess of the winner's name on a peice of paper, folded it and placed it under the game board. This ritual was performed on the second turn of the game. I was right both times. First and second player are the only ones with any chance to win the game unless they do something completely by accident (or stupidity) at some point during play.

There is no strategic thinking to this game at all. MB's "The Game of Life" has more to offer in terms of excitment.

Booooo.

I haven't actually played this one yet as the right occasion hasn't presented itself. I mainly have it to play with non-board gamers as it is very simple to grasp and there is a bit of blocking take-that. Which most people enjoy. Also for inebriated or very relaxed occasions.

RATING: 6
The total of the cards is just a bit more than the spaces needed to travel (on the shortest course).  Therefore, the player jumping to the lead early most likely plays small cards later on and the pack forms up.  Lots of jostling for position, a bit of card management, and quick play make for a fun racing game.

01-01-2013. Rated after at least 5 plays. Simple but nice racing game. You're constantly back-stabbing your opponents by putting your cart right in front of them, making them lose turns. If you do it correctly, they limp behind you for a couple of minutes.

Glorious.

RATING: 6
This game is full of youth sentiment. There was a copy at the North Sea apartment were I used to spend two weeks during the summer holidays as a 10-11-12-... year old. But I think I would've been better off cherishing the memories of playing this game, rather than tracking down a copy to play it again. It just doesn't hold up against the many high quality games I've discovered during the past decennium.

:thumbsup: Clever card play and forcing your opponent to waste cards (i.e. making them take the outer bend) form much of the tactical play in this game. As a kid, you felt really clever when you made your dad run out of cards before he made it to the finish line.
:thumbsup: There's good variety of different tracks.

----

:thumbsdown: The tracks in the 2005 reprint have been redesigned. The clever card play mentioned above seems to have been completely eliminated. Try to look for a 1989 printing instead of the new one. It's more fun.

A great little filler.  I personally can't take running three races back to back and neither can the rest of the group.  So, we generally get this one to the table at the end of an evening and run a single race.  We play with the variant that the lead player's horse dies if he only has 6's in hand.

Comments are for QJet.

The closest thing to Wipeout as a board game. An elegant but opaque  combination of hand management and board play, and the double sided board with two tracks per side should give it good replay value. It is either very subtle or totally random, tho'.

If you can find them, I think Kramer's car racing games (Daytona 500, etc) are better in this niche.

One of the simpliest race games.  It seems to work very well, nevertheless it feels that almost everything is decided in the first lap, so going until three is probably too much.  It looks like originally it was a Formula 1 game and they had to come with something to justify the [i]pit stop[/i], although the payment to Caesar is not convincing enough.  I miss some naughty interaction between players, expectable in a game about races in the [i]Circus Romanus[/i].

Not much in the way of meaningful decisions, but that's the way I like it :)

Very very very simple, very light, plays 6 and get through it in about 30mins.  There _is_ more to it than what it sounds when you read the rules - hardly a deep strategy game, is a largely about hand management (with 4 fingers tied behind your back) and trying to stuff up your opponents where you can and trying to time your runs.  The luck doesn't stop this being very a enjoyable upsized filler and having some great laughs when the traffic jams up.  Good fun.

This is an interesting, if fairly light tactical race game.  While you do have some options due to holding a hand of cards, you really are at the mercy of what comes up.  We often found ourselves with very little choice in our movement, which could be quite frustrating.  In fact, the winner the first time we played was determined not by how well they positioned themselves in the final lap, but by drawing multiple high cards in a row while the others did not.  (Perhaps I am just displaying that I have not grasped some of the subtleties of the game by stating this.)  Still, there are some tactical decisions to be made and the game was a lot of fun to play.  All in all, it was a fun experience.  [07/13/2007]

This is a light little racing game where most of the tough decisions are in the back of the pack.

One of the easiest racing games to explain but it doesn't quite play itself. I can't imagine playing by the official rules of playing four races and adding up points.

I can't imagine why they made changes from the Ravensburger board.

Fun and light chariot racing game.  The rules aren't complicated, but there are some fun wronkage components to it that make for an entertaining time.

Oh, it's OK.  It's a good filler for up to 6 people and ends quickly.  It seems pretty dependent upon chaos - do you happen to be in a bad spot?  The main strategy seems to come in if you are in the lead and how to block effectively.

BestWith:6,5 [Racing] Ramming Variant: If you're blocked on your turn and can't move at all you can play a "1" and switch places with the chariot in front of you. It makes for a nasty race. Note to self: Not so interested in Q-Jet 21xx anymore.
Variant: If you are blocked, draw a card. If you play a card, don't draw if your hand is more than 3.

Perfect short race game with some card management. We played it always with 4 and seldom with 3 and 1 time with 6. It was always a very close finish.

Addition to the german Pro Ludo version: This version has different maps then the original Ravensburger version. Also the rules vary slightly and not to the advantage from the game. We decided to take from each player a 1 or 2 card out of the card pile to make the game more challeging. Further the maps are not made for 3 players.

This holds up extremely well for its age. It's a pity they ruined the art in the new version though. The tracks look both boring and confusing in the new version, and they changed it so each side only has one track instead of two. So I'm really happy to have my old Ravensburger copy.

Well, "my copy"… my sister claimed that she personally got the game as a present once, and I have no reason to doubt her, so I guess it's really hers. I intend to keep it until she explicitly requests it though… :)

A decent racing game with loevely bits. I remember playing it with great gusto in the 90's, but it has faded somewhat since. Mostly bcause of better alternatives, I guess. This game defenitely has a runaway leader problem: once ahead, you can hardly be overtaken anymore.

If you want historical accuracy, more than the most basic of strategic decisions, and a game where starting in last position doesn't mean that finishing first is nearly impossible, this isn't the game for you.  If you want a very simple, quick-playing, low mental energy game with very nice bits, this is perhaps the game for you.  If you want a really fun yet still very simple racing game, try "Formula De Mini" or "Um Reifenbreite", or even "PitchCar", instead.  Game design: 3/5  Personal enjoyment: 1.5/5  Total: 4.5/5

RATING: 6
[Pro Ludo 06 edition] {Rome, racing, gateway; hand-management, card-driven; optimal 5-6p} Ave Caesar is an interactive and thematic racing game. It's nice that it's reprinted. It's interactive and mildly confrontational. It's fun to see that a player intentionally blocks a path. AC targets families; gamers may not like its randomness and sitting-order playing sequence.  For our play group, playing a full game (4 races) is way too long and boring; playing 2 races is already enough for me.

The components are nicely made. The chariots and coins are nicely sculptured and sturdy. The board is thick. The cards are not of common size; it's hard to find suitable card sleeves. The box is awfully large than necessary. I can pack 10 other card games inside the box.

I am still considering whether it is a good gateway game or not.  It has several good elements of gateway games but it is too long and repetitive for some players.

[Old edition] I haven't got a chance to try the old edition yet. There are some comments that the old boards are better. I have yet to check. The new rule has no "Ausgebremst Adaptation" variant. I think this variant is quite tactical; I don't know if this variant can fit the new boards.

RATING: 6.5
Took a lot longer than I expected, but this is definitely a fun light game. And by light, I mean feather-weight.

Not to be taken too seriously considering the main goal is to make life difficult for your fellow racers and they will be doing the same to you.

I just got my copy of Q-Jet and boy does it look superb. Not that I wouldn't get a copy of Ave Caesar if it ever gets reprinted. You must play the advanced rules with multiple draw decks and an optional card in the pits.

After a few trails, I advocate using the 3 deck split option where you draw from a 1/2, 3/4 and 5/6 decks. 

Also fun to play the 1 switches place with the player directly in front option.

An OK game of positioning, blocking, and keeping your options open. Its a shame the ProLudo reprint couldn't have included a few laurel tokens for multi-race games, rather than making me go looking for pencil & paper. Seems lightweight & one-dimensional compared to Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix.

One Play first opinion.

A fun game.  It is not in the vein of games I would normally play so I won't make a point of obtaining it, however I enjoyed playing it.  It has some "screw your neighbor" in it which (depending on who you are playing with) can either make it a lot more fun, or put you on the couch for a week.  With the game I played it was a lot of fun cutting each other off and I can just imagine how it would feel with a full six players (we played with four)

A friend found a shrink-wrapped Ave Caesar on the bottom shelf in a toy store i Denmark, and he kindly purchased it for me .

Since I enjoy this games so much I had to get Q-Jet as well. The graphics in Ave Caesar is better, but Q-Jet comes i a Carcassonne-size box and is much easier to carry around. 

Update 09.26.2006: OK, I had to get the ProLudo edition as well, so now I own three editions of the game. Must get Ausgebremst as well, I guess. 

This is a great racing game!

Ave Caesar can be short, silly fun.  There is so much luck here that I have trouble accepting this as anything other than random filler.  Turn order and card draw sequence play an overwhelming role.

Fun, light and quick racing game in which you play cards from your limited deck with values from 1 to 6 to move that many spaces.  The fun comes from the fact that it's as much about screwing over the other racers by burning your low cards in a way that boxes them in at the bottlecks as it is about crossing the finish line.  I imagine the game isn't nearly as much fun with less than 5 players.

Yet another racing game that can join the ranks of TurfMaster, Formula De, Powerboats, Snow Tails, and Mississippi Queen as games that others apparently enjoy, but for some reason don't click for me. I think I'll stop trying racing and deduction games, or at least stop writing about them, so you can stop reading about them (which I'm sure you'll appreciate), because those seem to be the two genres that I simply don't "get" for whatever reason. Like other racing games, Ave Caesar consisted of playing numbered cards to move around in a circle to see who can move around the fastest. It had some narrow passages that provided for some amusing nastiness, but in the end was just another boring racing game. If I absolutely have to play a racing game then I'll opt for Jamaica or Um Reifenbreite because at least the former has combat and the latter has a team system that differs from the standard first-past-the-post method, but generally I'll take any other type of game instead, except probably a deduction game.

Unless we were playing wrong (and I had plenty of time to read the rules), the blocking feature is horribly broken.

My horrible experience: Five horses, on the simple side.  I made it around to the upper left corner.  I had 6,6,5 in my hand and was lapped twice blocked in a corner before I could move as other players were alternately moving and were occasionally blocked themselves in front of me, so I couldn't move again until the lead horses were already on the third (and last) lap.

Granted, it started as a dick-move by the guy on my right, but the eight or ten turns I was blocked afterwards were inevitable - even if others didn't want to block me, it was all they could do.

Being a fan of real races I find this a superb racing game. Simple, beautiful, fun and really expandable (there are lots of variants possible).

My preferred variant is with 3 players, each one controlling 2 chariots as a team. Points go for each chariot bu sum as a team.

Unfortunately, the recent reissue of the game shortened the course so that the wonderful tension of moving extra spaces vs possibly not being able to finish the race has been ruined.  Find the older Ravensburger edition if you can.

Great if you are looking for a game that plays really well with six players (how may games do?), that can be explained in three minutes and that still requires some thought during your turn.

The only gripe I have with it, is that the last player to start seems to be at a disadvantage (especially with six players).

An interesting chariot racing game. At first blush, the game looked too easy to be fun. But if played at a quick pace, the game actually simulates the race pretty well. The runaway leader issue is resolved by preventing the leader from using the "6" card. While thematically it really doesn't make sense, the game does balance itself out if you clog your hand with sixes and cannot progress forward fast enough that others can catch up. However, it doesn't make sense that I am near the finish line, with sixes at hand, but can't use it to finish the game.

Still, with 6 players, this game shines due to its simplicity. I wonder if we add a couple more rules for chariot fighting, whether this game would be better. Overall a well-balanced and decent oarty-esque game.

This game is OK.  It's a basic racing game that is highly luck dependent.  In fact, basically all you do is draw cards at random and move your chariot along.  The basic strategy is that there are a finite number of moves (on all the cards) so that you can run out of steam and not cross the finish line if you take the wrong paths or not the inside line.

As such, the basic strategy seems to be always taking the inner-most routes as possible and blocking others from doing so.  That's about it.  Meh, it's OK.

Pretty basic race/hand management game.  There are much better iterations out there (Automobiles, Winner's Circle, Great Western Trail, etc.).  Sold it to make room.

Traded. A solid racing game that is easy to learn. It's almost too easy. I want to try to incorporate some of the variants I've read about on BGG for the next time I play.

Racing game that gives tension because of the narrow passages. The kids thought it was great.

RATING: 8
8 rating with the original "nasty" rules.
3 rating with the new "nice" rules.
The new "nice" rules makes this a dumbed down, almost roll-and-move game. The old "nasty" rules are much better with much more important hand management and positioning and blocking/screwage.

TO TRY: play "1" card to swap place with chariot directly in front of you.

A short racing game that provides some fun. The theme is however obviously remodeled from an original one of Formula 1 racing, and maybe is it because of this that I can't find it this game that much appealing.

A game worth its positive reviews! A fun racing game with a good dose of player interaction.  You wouldn't believe how mean my sweet niece can be..

¡Un juego digno de la crítica positiva que ha recibido!  Una divertida carrera con una buena dosis de competencia entre los jugadores.  Ustedes no se pueden imaginar lo malvada que puede ser mi linda sobrinita..

Excellent easy to learn game for a group with a half hour of free time. After trying both the Asmodee and original boards, the original boards are far less forgiving and, as a result, do make you think more.

Chariot racing game, surprisingly fun.

RATING: N/A
Set in a Roman Coliseum, players use cards to move their chariots around a quasi-variable track. The track itself has bottlenecks and lane-changing restrictions, which make the race interesting for the racers (very similar to Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix or Daytona 500). Players are required to race three laps, and they must stop to 'Hail Caesar' before they can finish (a pit stop). The game is light, but if you waste too many moves taking the longer, outside-routes on corners, you may not have enough movement to finish the race. Later, the game was revamped into Ausgebremst, with the most notable changes being modular boards and options to reduce the luck.

A decent race game full of "take that" play, that still plays quickly enough to get done in a reasonable amount of time.

Card driven play makes it less luck-reliant than Formula De and its ilk, but it's by no means a strategic race game.

I love this game! One of my fondest gaming experiences is screwing over two players in one move: blocking one, and tieing the other so that he couldn't play a six and win. Since he had to move, though, I was able to play a six and bring victory to my family name.

Admittedly I've introduced the game to a few people who aren't fans because they were heavily screwed, but them's the breaks. The game moves quickly, and although you have only a few choices each turn (with some choices being obvious), I always enjoy playing and seeing how well I can stymie others.

This is not a bad game, I do not mean to rate it so low.  I played Snow Tails and heard that it compared to Ave Caesar.  I found Ave Caesar on clearance at my FLGS and decided to pick it up while waiting for Snow Tails to be released in the US.

They do compare to each other well.  Snow Tails to me is the more enjoyable game, though, as it has more interesting decisions with more card play.  Again, that isn't to say that Ave Caesar is a bad game.  I played against my wife, and she had some very clever card play that caused her to win the game.  Maybe if I won ;)

Wow. It's amazing how much depth and fun there is to be found in a game with such simple rules.
But you need to play with several people for the game to get really exciting. Otherwise the "take that" factor is simply not there (enough). I would recommend a minimum of 4 players.

I hate this game. If you're stuck in the back, you're pretty much guaranteed of never being able to move up to the front, because someone's fat horse ass is always in your way. Apparently, you're supposed to play multiple games of this in a row, and then rank the winners based on that, but who in hell wants to play this that many times?

There is not much to this game. Draw 3 cards, pick one and move your character.  Rinse and repeat. 

There is a lot of talk about strategy, but it seems you can get the same strategy elsewhere with more game.

I'm sorry, I don't see where the fun is in this.  I went back and read the reviews again, then played again, and I still think I'm missing something.  Play a card, move, play a card, move, blocked can't move.  I can't get through one round without sawing some logs.  Everyone here prefers Winner's Circle or Arena Maximus.

Quick to play, easy to teach, and the cards introduce a bit of short term strategy and hand management that I quite like.  Definitely a fun game for the family and gateway types.  It leaves me wanting a bit more though.  Like the ability to run my opponent off the track... or to equip my chariot with spikes and such.  (Sigh) Oh well.

Disappointed by this one based on 1 play.  Not as much game as I expected.  Pretty repetitive racing 4 races like the rules say, maybe scaled back a bit would help.  Glad I hadn't picked it up myself yet.  Will be content to play it occasionally, but happy it's not my own copy.

Best thing about Ave Caesar is the lack of dice.  I definitely much prefer card driven racing games.  However, while I certainly appreciate the minimalistic gameplay and the high screwage factor.  The whole experience felt rather straightforward and predictable.  Without variants, those who start first (especially in the pole position) seemed to have a tremendous advantage, so much so that they were never in any danger of falling behind.  Fairly mediocre.

I can see that a lot of people like moving pieces in a circle while using those same pieces to prevent other players from doing the same.  But I guess I am missing the part of the human brain that allows me to enjoy it myself.  No, I did not have fun while playing this, in fact it's possibly the least fun I've ever had playing a board game.  Would rather play candy land.

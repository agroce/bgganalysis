BTBW felt very different from regular Bohnanza even though the premise and many of the core mechanics of the 2 games are the same.  The wild cards give you more to think about when trading because you might have a special power that will go away and/or (since you cannot discuss whether cards are regular or wild) you might receive a "dead" bean (with a skull instead of a bean-o-meter) that will make your field worthless unless you get another bean of that type.  With 4 players, you only go through the deck one time which adds another wrinkle to think about since you'll only have X chances to obtain a bean of a given type.

UPDATE 2015: for me, the uncertainty of trade quality (akin to disasters in A.H. Civilization) makes this a slightly better game than plain/vanilla Bohnanza.

I like Bohnanza just fine. I loved it early in my boardgaming "career", but still enjoy the occasional play now and then. However, the ideal number in my opinion is 4 and I would probably never play with more than 5 due to the downtime, so the fact that Bohn to be Wild allows 7 players to play isn't of any interest to me. 
However, Bohn to be Wild has a lot of other things going for it: there are many new cards with pretty good artwork, but the main thing in this game are the special abilities of some of the cards. Some allow you to draw extra cards, some require you to take at least one of the three (yes, not two in this game) revealed cards, some counts as an extra card, some allow you to plant two kinds of cards etc. Pretty cool!

That being said, I think I still prefer the simplicity of Bohanza, but with gamers this game is probably slightly better.

Don't like the artwork, the illustrations, too much. Horse and cow beans are hard to tell apart. Super fun with mid- to large-size groups. Nice solo variant too.

Contains different kinds of beans than the basic bohnanza set, which to me is a disappointment because I liked the original beans much better. It does have a bit more variation to it and it's great to play with more players. Prefer the original game to this one at all times.

All the Bohnanza games I've played I've enjoyed.  They are each fun in their own right though the base and LadyBohn are my favorite.  Only deterrent in this version is what I consider to be an overpowered card (the play from anywhere in your hand card) coupled with the automatic 3 fields.  If the race to acquire a third field was still in play for this game I think the card would be fine, but as it is, I got this card and put it into play the first round and with three fields I never had to harvest anything until exactly when I wanted.  I love the "not allowed to tell if you're trading wild or not" rule though, and I enjoy the "you can't score this field until another card is placed on top" like the babies in LadyBohn.

aka Boohnanza 2.0 I still play it as regular boohnanza, the family really seems to like this. I think the cartoonish, slightly racist drawings help.

I needed the English rules, but the game gives freshness to original game  and cards do not have in game test to worry about. Stand alone game but we have used pieces of it to some degree or another in play with  Bohnanza plus.  Fnally broke down and ordered my own copy here and cannot wait for it to arrive so I am not dependent upon other area gamers wanting to bring out their copies.

This game is highly similar to Bohnanza, however had some different beans, some with variable powers, some with wilds, and some with penalties.  I liked some of the wilds, the turn-up three and may discard one after trades, and everyone draws one at the end of a turn rules.  I thought those were decent improvements from Bohnanza.

The game unfortunately had way too much clutter for the powers/penalties on some cards.  It slowed down the game by referring to their meaning and involving trading.  It can be a good way to get someone in trades, however generally people will ask about it, slowing down the game.  It tried to do too much from a more elegant game in Bohnanza.

To put it simple: this is Boonanza+. The only extra is the Wild Beans (and some minor rules changes). Imho not worth buying if you already own Boonanza, but buy this if you don't own it yet and like Boonanza.

Bohnanza with some extra effects on the cards. Clearly increases complexity, which might or might not be what you want.

My opinion of this Bohnanza game has been dropping with subsequent plays.  Since everyone has 3 bean fields and can discard one of the 3 flipped cards on their turn, it seems like everyone finishes with big stacks of cards and too much depends on luck of the draw.

Bohnanza generally: Part of the high rating is because although it is not necessarily a great game mechanically, it is good at creating a social gaming atmosphere and it very rarely fails to draw more casual players in and often gets them hooked. I also have a strong sentimental affection for this as one my partner and close, non-gaming friends enjoy a lot.


Great two player variant and generally great package but I don't know why they had to make the beans such racist characatures makes me embarrassed to show this game to anyone. Otherwise this is the definitive bohnanza.

The new mechanics add an interesting spin to the standard Bohnanasi gameplay.  I personally prefer the cleaner gameplay of the original but if you've played a lot of the original and enjoyed it then this may be a good way to add spice back into the game.  I would have rated this game higher but it loses points for the use of racial caricatures on the cards.

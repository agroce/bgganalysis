I think this was the first electronic game my parents bought for my brother and me. I own the french version from France called "Anti-Gang". I still have it after all these years and my kids play it. As an adult, I have a hard time enjoying it now: it's too easy to solve the thief's location, and the luck of the dice movement is the only balancing factor: just not fun or challenging anymore.

Played this a lot when my neighbor received this game for Christmas back in the early 80s.   Box is wrinkled/warped, and shows shelf wear.  All cards (except one sleuth card) and cash are present. Missing cool detective pawns and dice.  The electronics on the crime scanner still work fine.  The sleuth cards are flat, but you can tell they've been lovingly played with.  Surprisingly, the reward money is in very good shape and is unwrinkled.  Probably more of a parts copy, but the boys and I have played with replacement pawns.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
The box is solid.  It shows minor shelf wear and has a small dent on a bottom edge, but there is no dishing to the lid.  Game inserts, both cardboard and styrofoam, are complete and in pretty good shape, despite the age of the game. 
Electronics all work, and the crime scanner looks like new (9v duracell battery included).  All cards, pieces, detective pawns, money, dice, etc. are all present and accounted for and in good condition with no folds, etc.  Rule set is complete.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Box shows some minor shelf wear, esp. on the corners, with a couple of small (1"x1") patches where tape has pulled away some text on the back of the box.  There are no split corners.  Both the cardboard and styrofoam box inserts are also present.  In addition, there is the remnants of the original price tag, which shows that even back in the day this game cost $35.99.  Contents are in good condition.  Cards and cash are all present, with only a couple that sport a small crease.  Board and ruleset are complete and in good condition too.  Unfortunately, the blue detective pawn is missing.  Not too much of a problem, as I usually only play it three-player with my boys.  The crime scanner looks like new and works fine.

An okay deduction game that is a bit simplistic, but it's good for kids and good for c.1979.  The cards add a lot of strategy (well, mostly tactics) to the game... and the luck of the cards can make or break the game for you.

I loved this game since it first hit the shelves and I've thrifted 2 copies for $1.00 each when my own kids were young. They've enjoyed playing it with friends and cousins many times over the years.

I remember the thrill of playing this game as a youngster.  The electronic gadget really gave the game a mystique. 

I've had the opportunity to replay as an adult. There is a lot of satisfaction from the nostalgia. I also like the juxtaposition of teamwork and trying to be the first to catch the thief. 

But, sadly, the game doesn't hold up well all on its own. And, surpisingly to me...it was because of the cards. They are just over-powered and chaotic. I'm sure there are house rules that could be used to ameliorate that issue, but as is....if you subtract the nostalgia factor its really not that good of a game.  

That said, I'll still play it if someone requests it. I still have fun playing, but its for more reasons than the game itself.

Garage sale game, likely paid $2.  "Electronic cops and robbers".  It comes with an electronic crime scanner, and a game board that reminds me of Clue.  Requires a 9-volt battery.  (I haven't checked if the scanner works with a new battery, but it looks in good shape.)  Looks good.  I'm guessing it has similarities with Scotland Yard.

RATING: N/A
The electronic device that you used to deduce the position of the thief was quite innovative, and I recall the board and card design to be very nice and quite clever. I have many fond memories of playing this board game as child. I remember one "snow day" that my mom drove me over to a friend's house, and we played it for the first time. I believe it was a recent Christmas gift. I kept this game in my bedroom closet all through my teen years, but, sadly, I think it was sold without my knowledge during my parents' estate sale.

This game is still a lot of fun. Had this game at age 9 or 10... and now in my early 40's I find it still just as fun and intriguing.    I would love to see an updated game map, advanced play (ie. Turn off the street indicator on the scanner) and a bit more variety.  
 The level of nostalgia and fun that can be had is immeasurable for a few games of light fun deductive logic...and a bit of "Take that" from the Detective cards.

I think after this play, I still give it the same rating, but I believe me and Stop Thief will part ways. It just has one too many old-school game mechanics (dice for movement, old-skool cards that can cause runaways).

This was a great game when I was a kid until I figured it out.  There are a unique number of footsteps on several paths.  This became a give away to location of the thief to such a degree I couldn't get through three turns without initiating the final chase.  Until I had memorized all those paths this game was great.  Now it's stale.  Found a mint copy for $2 recently.  Will keep it for my kids I suppose.

Played it at least 4 times with kids now.  They like it a lot.

The family and I played this one a few weeks ago and it went over pretty well.  It was fun that we all sort of cooperated in helping to hunt down the thief based solely on audible clues from the 'scanner'.  This is not a luck game by any means.  The thief moves in a very particular manner and rule sets so when the clues come up, you need to turn on some logic circuits of your own in order to determine his path.  I really like this game and it is another I am surprised is not being updated and reproduced.  The game board is decent for its age.  The electronic scanner is a fun, interactive device everyone wants to hold, but the preponderance of the game is standard 80s card stock and plastic.  The character descriptions are comically outdated.  I scored a really nice copy of this game from a thrift store.  The price was a bit more than dirt cheap, but a great price, considering its condition.  And, I am a big fan of these early games which introduced technology into the gameplay.  The box has a bit of wear around the edges, but the rest is in still holding up, including the cellophane window.

Once you understand it (which takes about one suspect's worth of arresting), you'll love it. Stop Thief is a satisfying game of deduction that moves quickly. It proves that games with a battery-operated element don't just have to beep and make noise because they're there - this was a worthy use of technology that more games should have tried to mimic.

Hey folks, this game was for kids!! Of course it's no fun to play against other adults. Guh.

Great game.  Early computer game, the console tracked the location of the 'thief' and spat out audio clues to his location.  It was basically a deduction game--you had to use the clues to narrow down the invisible thief's place on the board.  You could hear footsteps (he moved a certain no. spaces/clue, broken windows, open doors.  If you took to long to track him down, he'd escape in a subway, and you'd have to start tracking him again.

I rate the game highly because my brothers and I played it a bunch, it made us *think* at a young age, and it was also an early 'computer' game where the computer actually aided gameplay.

Kids-type deduction game. For its time, its quite a good game. Components are nice, and the crime scanner is clever. However, the game is pretty easy to solve (especially with the Tips that reveal the EXACT location). I think the game would be better without the Sleuth cards.

Classic 70's electronic boardgame!!  This one is still fun to play to this day... mainly for kids, but can be fun for the right adults as well.  

The electronic "Crime Scanner" is what makes the game so much fun...  listening for the sounds of footsteps, or perhaps some breaking glass!!  It's not too hard to track down the thief, but some younger aged kids might have a tough time trying to do so...

This is certainly one of Parker Brothers better games... and really should still be made today... maybe with some updates to make it a little more challenging!!  

I still remember the old t.v. commercial for this... when someone finally captured the thief, someone would yell... "YOU GOT 'EM"!!!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A fun family game which is simple and enjoyable.  Uses an electronic handset to give audio clues as to the location of the thief as he moves around the board.  Very quick to play and usually easy to solve leading to a race against the other players.  Light on strategy so not taxing.

Canadian (i.e., bi-lingual) version. Fun, somewhat interesting game. Some of the cards are WAY too powerful ("Free Tip" and "Move Anywhere"). Would be more interesting/challenging without those two cards--or at least without the "Move Anywhere" card. My wife loved this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Purely own for childhood memories.  I like to play a quick track down the thief with the kids.  Let them push the clue button and within 7 to 10 clues we attempt to make an arrest.  So we only take out the board, computer handheld, and character cards.

One of the very first games I can remember playing.  A nice exercise in logic and deduction.  It's pretty much the same as Scotland Yard, except that a little computer thing takes the place of a human player for Mr. X.  I think it's fun, and the computer is pretty nifty.

This is an electronic cops and robbers board game.  You listen to the sound of the burglar to determine where he is, then you move to where you think he is and attempt to arrest him.  
This game uses an electronic tracking device to hear the robber's footsteps and you enter his coordinates when you attempt to make an arrest.  It then tells you if you have captured your man or missed.

RATING: 5
A clever game that uses a electronic device that emits sound clues to the presence of the thief.  You play as a detective and roll a die to race to the section of the board that you think where the thief is present.  Once you are within one square of where you think the thief is located, you enter the squares' coordinates to determine if you are correct and capture the thief for a reward.  Really had lots of fun playing this when I was young, but after a while you got to know the board so well that it only took a few clues to determine the thief's location.

A game I fondly remember from childhood.  I loved this game in the early 80s.  They should remake it with better sounds.  I still think that it was a fun game, and challenging for young people!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It's not bad, trying to work out all the possible places the thief can be, getting there before everyone else (dice rolls) and taking your guess. Having the electronic device provide all the clues (via sound effects) and keeping track of where the thief is is pretty cool. But there's often a bunch of places it can be, so you'll need to guess, unless you're lucky enough to draw tip cards (which allow you to press the button which tells you exactly where the thief is). That's a lot of luck (dice, cards, plus the chance that he re-starts near you or not) so don't get invested in the result. In practice, the new genre of chase down deduction games provide a richer experience, despite the lack of electronics. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Cool!!  I thought of this as Scotland Yard with pizazz.  The sound effects and graphics weren't annoying, but rather wonderful instead.  The board was cool.  I went through soooo many 9-volt batteries with this game as a kid.

Nostalgia probably paints this game better than it is, but I thought it was super fun.

Just recently played this game for first time in 20 years, and it was just as fun as I remember. I really enjoyed the sometime cooperative spirit that naturally surfaces between players, along with the individual pursuits of monetary gain from having nabbed the culprits. Nicely detailed board, and the sound effects are way too cool!

RATING: 7
Finally got a chance to play this one,I have to say I liked it. Pretty easy to understand and using the phone is fun! I know most people frown at electronic devices in board games,but I say bring it on! The game is just what you think it is,a ghost player is moving around the numbered board stealing stuff and your trying to catch him and when you do you get paid a set amount of money for who ever the crook may be. "They all are the same as far as how they move,just different names and awards" That alone would be pretty dry,but what makes this fun is you collect cards that allow you to take money from other players,lose turns,send then back to the start location etc. to help yourself reach the goal of $2,500 first to win the game. The game played in a nice amount of time,fairly close in the end and was just fun. I wish the sounds were more realistic because you have to listen to what he's doing rather it be opening a door,braking window,running down the street etc. After a few rounds you will catch on to the sounds.

Electronic game, very exiting back than.
Of course, now a days, with everyting computerised it seems a bit old.

When I was young we played this with the family, until someone decided to be a sore loser and never wanted to play this ever again, after which it disappeared on the shelve.

Recently dug this up again and to my surprise found it still in working order. Fun little game.

This is one of those games that is supposed to be competitive, but seems to always end up cooperative!

The puzzle is just too fun to do individually.  everyone wants to participate together.  yeah, there is a reward for being the guy that actually catches the thief, but it is so satisfying to HELP catch the thieves that you're never THAT disappointed when someone else gets them!

This is also one of those games that people walk by, and can't help but stop and watch.  Then, when it is over, they want to join in.

A real winner!

RATING: 5
OK game, but for a territorial influence game there are others I'd rather play (capitol, san marco, el grande).  It didn't seem like enough reward for taking over areas since the loser would get immediate points and you don't get any until the end.  A minor complaint - this is one of the few games where I wish the board was a little plainer, the pieces we played with (knights symbols rather than solid disks) clashed with the background.

(Parker Brothers/Hasbro edition)

A fantastic game, with only the occasional obvious choice to be made; the rest of the time, it's a head-scratcher. Typically Knizia, although, IMO, it's more realistically themed than most other Knizias. And easily over and done with in under an hour! 
My first play of it was IMMEDIATELY followed by a second play, so impressed were we: and I've done that with very few other games.

Someone kindly explained the rules to me, and told me what not to do. I then did exactly that, and won. So how does that work ?
In fairness, despite my shenanegans on the board, the only reason I won was because the rest were so intent on stabbing each other in the back that they forced territory upon me, and try as I might, I simply failed to lose.

Acquired 2/4/07

An area control game that seems more intimidating/serious than it really is. Enjoyable, quick play with good strategy possibilities. Nice theme. Really nice box, board, and bits, though the cards are not as flexible or slick as they should be. (Face to Face edition)

RATING: 3
{1 play - 4 players} Wow, what a disappointment.  Maybe we got the rules wrong (but I don't think so) or were playing poorly (possible - the game does seem to come with a bit of group-think), but this one left me flat.  Seems like if you didn't keep building stuff up, you'd lose it, and if players got into a cold war (other players did in our game), than one player (me) can just nip off little pieces around the edges for the win.  The ability to use any card to place adjacent ended up being, like, 80% of our moves, kinda making the numbers on the cards worthless, but, again, group-think, maybe.  We could've missed something, but not only don't I think so, I'm really not that interested in playing again to see.  I'm surprised people feel this is underrated, though, as the bulk of the ratings here are average or above.  I'm actually surprised there aren't more lower ratings for this.

feels kludgy.  didn't like the retention of color, etc with mergers.  would like to see some VP benefit to not playing blocking castles.  i avoided conflict in a 5 player game for an easy victory.  i don't see how that should be possible when the game is playing with a full suite of players.  need to be simpler or deeper with a redesign of the board for me to like it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's time to up the rating on this game; it's really fun to slowly grow your duchies, attempting to finagle yourself into a position where you can join things up across a river. It gives that nice tense bottom-of-the-stomach feeling that good intellectual games do.

Finally traded for this game. Haven't had the energy to sort the bits and bag them properly, though.

RATING: 6
A 'typical' Knizia design.  On the surface it is a game about the Rhein and the lands along it.  At its heart it is a numerical influence game.  There are several rules governing add influence that make it worthy of note, but game play is pretty dry and about half way through a game, the theme is completely forgotten.  In Knizia's way it is well balanced and is likely to appeal to his fans.  [GTI Code: AGSD]

RATING: 7
I like this game but it doesn't get to the table very often. Play a card, place a knight then draw a card. There is some direct conflict in the game so women don't seem to like it. This is not a war game but the conflict with the knights and dukes scratches that itch for me. For a Knizia, there is very little math and economics.  Plays in 45 minutes or less. 

I liked it, but it never got played. Traded. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I must say that this game didn't grab me on my first play. I would like to play again to form a more solid oppinion of the game.

The game plays quickly, and has a lot of elements to it, but I found that a bad set of cards simply ruined your chances, but perhaps I made some tactical mistakes.

Interesting 'filler' - but deep enough I'd consider playing 2-3 games of it in a session.

More you play it the more strategies come to mind. A surprising hit, I expected it to be much lesser a game than this. Got it in a Maths Trade, and now it's a keeper! Feels a bit like Acquire, but with more control, much prefer it to that.

** Update, not played for a while, latest play and nowhere near as enthusiastic now ... probably better with less players. Rating dropped.

RATING: N/A
Three possibilities occur to me after the first play:  Either there's a lot of subtlety to this game that I didn't get, or it's heavily subject to luck-of-the-draw, or it's really simple and I was overthinking.  Winner focused on getting duchies in as many 4-pt cities as possible, while the rest of us fooled with the castles and cathedrals.  You can't focus on areas where you never get a single card.  Hidden but trackable scoring, with a huge part of it based on ending position.  One play, 4p.  Preliminary rating:  5.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
It plays like othello with added strategies and rules and a medieval twist to make it unique. It's a awesome game. First time through is a learning experience in some parts where converting and reinforcing are concerned on the river. The rules are actually quite simple. Second time through will be faster and easier to strategize. As the first time through you start to notice the deeper strategies you can pull off as you play, from the placement/reinforcing of knights to blocking with the bastions, converting knights with the archbishop. Following games will be deeply enjoyalble! 

After a few plays I highly recommend this to anyone who loves medieval themed games. This one has more strategy involved then you think even with simple rules and the drawing of cards.

RATING: 5
A pretty unique take on the area majority system, where the areas are actually formed by the players throughout the game, and then merged and morphed in a struggle to control them.

This is all done via placing knights via card play, with most knights in an area (called a duchie in the game) scoring that area at the end of the game.  So, there is some luck of the draw, but good hand management can likely overcome some unfortunate card drawing.

Trying to form your duchies while also protecting them from takeover by neighboring duchies made for a somewhat interesting game, but overall it just lacked that fun factor for me and seemed a little bland.

RATING: 5
Decent game. Some here have described it as a mix of Tigris & Euphrates and Acquire. I have not yet played T&E, but the camparison to Acquire certainly is valid. Neither Acquire or Rheinländer overwhelms me. Solid games to be sure. But the dependence on the card/tile draws bothers me, though Rheinländer makes it easier to get rid of unwanted cards, which has to be welcomed.

I also wish there'd be more of a theme in the game. It's a bit too generic for my tastes. More could have done with the Rhineland theme. It would have been also nice if the graphics where more akin to the beauty of the Rhine Valley and depict some of the many beautiful castles and towns on its banks, isles and surrounding hills. That would have enhanced the whole visual experience.

A fun game of trying to spread out over the board as much as possible with the best placements (as not all areas are created equally).  However, you must beware of attacks from others or the possibility to attack others, which creates the need to consolidate your forces. This is the primary tension of the game.

Ten plays... I like this game and should play it more often. I'm glad to see that it's not a game with obvious choices necessarily. Since other players generate points for you when they take over your duchies, large duchy turnovers can generate a lot more points then a strategy of merely maximizing your number of small duchies (about twice as much in a recent game). What's the best strategy? I don't know. One thing I like for sure, it's relatively easy to teach, quick to start playing, and flows enjoyably.

I enjoy the positional play in this game. There is more hand management to the cards than at first appears. There is some kinship with Tigris and Euphrates, but I haven't quite figured out how to maximize scores yet.

This is a game that should not be as obscure as it is.  It is simple and subtle and really fun to play.  I thought I was winning, and so did everyone else.  We were wrong.  If I ever get another chance to play this (and I hope I do), I'll know better.

The game seems to fall apart toward the end, but I sort of liked it. I generally like Acquire-derivative games and this is no exception.

Maybe I would rate with 7 or 6 but is my favourite game. Push your luck Game. Acquire on steroids. [b]My favourite game.[/b] very simple, very quick (30 min.), very fun, fights, very tense, several tactics (bastions are very strategic), great simple score (is very probably that the winner will be the person who has more duchies), you need some of memory, good replayability, all cards are different, two ways uses them. I never have enough with this game and [b] I want a PC game.[/b] Face2Face x2 and Hasbro Edition x1.


[COLOR=#990000]**[Español]** Siempre quiero jugarlo. Tal vez debería de darle un 7 o un 6 pero es mi juego favorito. En la versión primera, que es la de Hasbro, el tablero cambia un poco con respecto a la de Face2Face ya que las casillas 13-14 ahora están pegadas a la 30-29 al igual que las 3,4,5 cosa que le da más vida al juego.

Este juego solo lo recomendaría si os encantara el Acquire o el No thanks, tal vez sea a este último al que más se le parezca.

Se juega en 30 min., es muy agresivo, con luchas, muy simple pero puedes usar varias estrategias. Si os gustan los juegos con una temática un poco guerrera y agresiva, algo así como el San Marco, Carolus Magnus o Samurai seguramente os agrade este, eso sí, con la diferencia de que es el más agresivo y que la suerte también se necesita en muchos momentos pero con un poco de práctica la reducirás. El sistema de juego tiene cosas similares al Acquire y a El grande ya que básicamente también es un sistema de "mayorías lineal".

Es un juego que no me atrevería a recomendar a todo el mundo ya que por lo que he leído mucha gente en sus primeras partidas, lo tratan de juego raro o no entienden cómo se hace para ganar, tal vez si se explican las tácticas del mismo guste más.

La versión de Face2Face trae el reglamento en castellano pero he visto un fallo garrafal ya que viene a decir, que en vez de robar carta al final del turno (es lo que hay que hacer) dice SACAR una del mazo; ¡por Dios! algún hispano no entenderá nada.

El precio del juego es muy caro en su edición de Face2Face de USA en cambio su tirada Alemana ronda un precio de 27 euros.[/COLOR]

Shades of Acquire and Tigris & Euphrates as kingdoms merge, with the kingdom that gets gobbled in the merger scoring modestly. The kingdoms that remain at game's end score handsomely.
The game is not bad, but the components are too big, and the board is too busy. As a result, it can be difficult to determine the extent or value of a kingdom.

There's a political skill of convincing people not to do that that I lack.  Rheinlander has this issue, but it's compounded by the fact that without the right cards, there's only so much you can do.  At heart, I didn't enjoy it at all.

It's an early Knizia and it's showing promise of great ideas yet to come from the man.  But here, these ideas are still in their infancy and very rough at the edges.  It's not bad, but there are many better games around.

It's fast and simple, but I didn't find it all that fun.  The scoring is kind of funky.  I won but felt like I stumbled into it.  I guess I tried to keep my duke's on the board...and that was the difference.  They are worth 1 point if they are removed, 5 if they stay.  So I didn't compete much for the high value stuff and mostly had a bunch of small duchies.  I was the victim of a couple of takeovers but not too many.  This would have been interesting back in 99, but now there are so many better games.

RATING: 7
The forgotten Knizia tile laying game, along the banks of the Rhine.  Players play cards to build up duchies and try to hang onto them, defeating adjacent duchies.  Partial points are awarded if you're booted out of a duchy mid-game, but you earn full payout if you can hold  it to the end.  Quite similar to Acquire, and solves the "lock out" problem that game has by making the numeric cards more flexible in how they are used.  The Archbishop is fun too!  Ended up tossing out my Face 2 Face edition - fungal things growing inside!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Seems like there aren't enough knights (shields) to fill up enough space for there to be enough mergers before the end of the game.  I think the trick is just to have the most duchies at the end, unless you can score the same duchy multiple times by being able to take it over after being cashed out.  Needs more play to figure out the subtleties of the scoring.

Played 5 player - decent game. Any real power moves seemed to be rather luck of the draw in many cases. I had trouble "seeing the board" and I'm not sure how I could have done much better than I did. I'd play it again with fewer players perhaps, but it didn't really seem like my thing.

Improved scoring method (from cmessenger):

Whenever a city, church or fortress comes into your possession (by forming or extending a duchy, OR taking over an opponent's duchy), you take that score immediately. When you form a duchy, take one additional point (for the duke). At game end, you score 4 points for each duke you have on the board, plus 5 points if you own the archbishop.

[4 plays] I like this game quite a lot.  It has an interesting similarity to Acquire, which I detest.  Both share the aspect of mergers and it being good to have your units taken over.  I'm not sure exactly what the difference is, though I think it goes beyond the fact that the thought of the stock market makes my eyes glaze over with boredom.  Rheinlander is groovy and has nifty mechanics.  I am still trying to decide what I think is the sweet spot for number of players, and look forward to playing a lot more.

But, it tneds to an elimination game, and if you get forced off the board, it's hard to get back in late in the game. I won by 1 pt, but when we play this again, we'll try different tactics.

Explained in seconds; played in minutes; enjoyed for hours.  The minimalist design betrays the depth of choices accessible to the players each turn.  Much can be done and of course, most of the time you wish you could do all of them at the same time.  Keep an eye on your opponents' bishops as the Archbishop can be devastating with the right cards.  Inspired game by the Master.  Final note: it is better to have several dukes remaining at game's end but, to remove other dukes, it is better to have one monstrous concentrated duchy to gobble up opponents.  Finding the balance between these two propositions is the key to victory.

RATING: 9.5
I wasn't too sure about getting this one due to the lowish ratings. Once the reprint came out and it looked oh so nice, I decided to take a gamble on it. The first game I played I wasn't impressed. I didn't dislike it, but it didn't wow me either. The second time I played things started to click. By the third time I was hooked. This is a great game that has a ton of stuff to think about and plays like a bigger Knizia, but still finishes in 30-45 minutes. 

The Jester card is such a simple little idea, but it adds so much tension to the game. You never know when the draw deck and the discard pile are going to be shuffled together...do you play cautious or do you press your luck and hope the card that can hurt you is buried deep enough in the deck? 

I have the new Face2Face reprinted edition. It looks so much nicer than the original and the box art is great.

***I'm bumping this up to a 9.5. Rheinlander far exeeded my expectations and has become one of my favorite games. The tension is very high throughout the game and how to manage your hand of cards is crucial. Excellent game and hugely underrated. It took me a few plays to really get into it though.

RATING: N/A
? Apparently a Reiner middleweight in the mold of a TtD or Samurai. F2F version is pricey for a production downgrade. Still, it's Reiner so this merits a wait-and-see or an opp to acquire at a discount. *** UPDATE: I'll pay $60 for the Ravensberger Torres, and the alea/RGG Taj Mahal, but I won't for a Face2Face Rheinlander. Are you kidding me? It's almost double the price of a new big box HiG game. For a game that's just "nice to have" that's a no go. Off the wishlist.

This is a great game! It starts off slowly with construction of small duchies, but as the game progresses the duchies grow and come into conflict with each other. All too soon someone is on your borders and you don't know whether they have the card they need to invade. Then you notice that someone else is building something big across the river and they may be able to come across if only they have the right card... but you're holding that one so you know it's safe. I find this game to be very tense and surprisingly quick.

I expect that this game is most interesting with 4 or 5 players.

What a delightful collection of components!  After a couple of plays (a 3-player and a 2-player) the game certainly has proven itself to have some depth.  It reminds me of Acquire in that I must choose one card (tile) from my hand to place a knight (tile).  The card-driven choice-limiting aspect of the cards is reminiscent of China (Web of Power.)  A friend offered me a fair price for my copy and I sold it.  Now it takes up space in his house rather than mine, and I get to play it once in awhile.

Players play cards to add knights to the number indicated on the card or ignore the card number and reinforce existing knights. Two or more knights equals a duchy that may be worth more points depending on the cities, castles, and churches incorporated within. Opponents with fewer knights can suffer a hostile takeover. 

Very quick, light game that I'd happy to play occasionally but it really needs five players for the player interaction to shine, or a bare minimum of four to be enjoyable.

PROS
-Components, pieces, boards, and cards are fun and colorful.
-The takeovers make for a lot of fun backstabbing and tit-for-tat.
-The river and some sections of the board make for some interesting possibilities in terms of takeovers.

Four plays. As others have probably said, this would seem to be Knizia's take on Sid Sackson's [i]Acquire[/i], and it might well be an improvement on the classic. I must confess that I found it to be a bit opaque at first, but I think I've gotten the hang of it now. It's a bit deeper than I realized, as there are many approaches and possibilities to explore, though at the same time there is also a degree of luck involved. It's a bit reminiscent of Tigris & Euphrates in that way.

I think that maybe the reason that people find it hard to grasp is that the idea of scoring points because you've [i]lost[/i] control of a region doesn't make real-world sense. I don't think they considered these "mergers" back in the day.

Nice "light wargame" system. Has low luck in that 'combat' is deterministic, but ability to maneuver / attack is based on having the cards you need. A bit to the abstract side of the military theme.

Simple but interesting use of numeric cards to place player pieces on the board and form areas where the players compete for majorities. I first owned the Face 2 Face version, but I disliked the mishmash of components that included plastic miniatures, wooden discs, cardboard tokens and a huge pawn - all representing people! Even the artwork was inconsistent, as castles and churches were simple line drawings. I sold the game after playing twice. I eventually bought a German edition, played once more, realized that I didn't enjoy it that much and traded it. The game works well, it's light and fast, and I would certainly play it again, but not often enough to need to own it.

Everybody said it plays like Acquire, with certain exceptions. It reminds me more of Tigris & Euphrates, where you are trying to expand your duchy, but the card mechanic of laying out your knights and merging duchies is definitely like Acquire, except there are no stocks! Instead of a grid of where to place your tiles, it is more like a curvy line.

Update (4/11/09): Seven months had passed since playing this game. Since I had recommended it, it must have been memorable. And it was. Neat, quick playing game with the right amount of luck, with fascinating tactical play. Knizia does it again, giving one so many options, with so little time to do them all, but where one is forced to make a difficult choice, time and time again. Unique game. I'm upping this to a '9'.

First try with 3 players. I had some reservations about Rheinlander before starting play. The components do not match the usual design standards for modern German boardgames and the rule book is very verbose. This gave the impression of a game from the early 1990s. The board and the simple nature of a player's turn (play a card and place a counter) do nothing to dispel the retro feel. However there are also a number of Kniziesque mechanisms which make the game far more interesting than first appears. A second play will be needed to grasp the tactics/strategy.

Area control and as such best with more players as with less without removing some of the board there will be too much room and it will become much less competitive. 

Ugly ugly board but the other components were good. More strategy than first appears although the decision tree is limited. However the decision you do have to make (where to place) is a critical one just about every round. Several ways to score as you would expect and the game plays fast and has a short play time.

Starting to get a good feel for it. When to play cards for reinforcement, when to hold them to try and set up a killer move. I have seen where card draw can screw you later on in the game, but I guess then it's sort of up to you to keep your options open. Also, bastions are great weapons  to either block a duchy or protect your own. Very good game, and it seems to scale well.

RATING: 7.5
This is an enjoyable, fast playing area control game. Spaces numbered sequentially are along the banks of a river. The first time going to a space requires the exact number on the card. In the following rounds any card can be tossed for expansion. Once two tokens have been placed a knight can be put down which is worth more points. One also wants to control city tokens for bonuses. There are cities with points, cities with castles in which a 2nd token is added immediately, and monasteries for which having a majority gives a conversion ability. It is possible to merge into the other players regions in which the majority of tokens gets control. There are also three barricades that can be to protect from mergers.

Rheinländer is an example how gaming evolves. In the early 2000's it was sought after enough to get a reprint and was played regularly. Nowadays, players shrug it off as abstract and mediocre. The underlying area majority principle lost most of its lustre.

Replaying it after approx. 10 years, I was surprised that I really enjoyed it. It reminded me of a less complex but still worthwile Tigris & Euphrates. While placing knights wherever you draw cards appears lacklustre (sic!) and using any card, no matter what number, as reinforcements feels odd, the open nature of boardplay gradually reveals the potential for subtle strategies and the depth encompassed in the ruleset. As usual for majority games, victory will be decided by small advantages in high-stake battles. Invest and win or lose the game. Rheinländer's strength is offering an alternative strategy of focusing on multiple small scale majorities.

RATING: 5
The rules are unusually long for a game of this weight - it took a long time to get this to the table simply because I never made it all the way through the rules.  It is kind of a baffling game, a little bit like Acquire, a little bit like E&T, but not as good as either one of those.  I found that the physical design could be much better - there is no room for the dukes to be placed, and it is quite difficult to tell what is going on later on in the game because there is so much stuff on the board.  Something tells me that there is a better game in here waiting to be discovered with further play, but I don't think I will get to that point.

2016-10-15 - 6.5 - That's a pretty quick area control game which feels quite different from others. We played with 3 players and I guess it's better when there is more players on the board, which will leads to more takeovers. Of course, as usual in Knizia's deisgns, the theme is so pasted on it's even funny.

2016-11-12 - 6.5->6 - I don't see a bright future for this game in my groups. It would be probably hard to bring to the table and I don't know if I really want to try. I could play it again though.

I always wanted to try this game, the map is beautiful. It seems as though after trying this out myself, the best way to win is to create many small duchys, but the most interesting/fun aspect of the game is the conflict, which if a player wants to win will avoid. I wish there were more knights for each player before the game ends. I like how a river space can be used after the banks are filled to connect two different duchys across the river.
I can see this game being very cutthroat and fun if players know what they're doing.
hard to keep everything sorted in the box, and then they are only blocks and kind of bulky not so great quality plastic barons. Cards are excellent!

RATING: 7.7
The most fun and lightest game of those end-of-the-nineties Knizia games that have some mechanism connections to Acquire. of course it's also the most luck-dependent one, although the rule that allows you to place your knights next to already placed knights instead of the given number makes your strategies more flexible than it seems first (or than Acquire). I guess Rheinländer might be rated so (relatively) low only because it was released just after a bunch of heavier Knizia titles and gamers were expecting something meatier.

RATING: 7.5
[2007.Jul.18] An underrated Knizia game--and a surprisingly weighty one at that--which has some passing similarities to Tigris & Euphrates. Best of all, it plays rather quickly even with a full complement of 5-players. Thank you, Herr Doktor!

Played twice.  Five players.  Seems like there's a dominant strategy - get as many small duchies as you can on the board.  Stay small - don't go big.  Perhaps more games will allow players to foresee this strategy, and prevent it.  Otherwise, a pretty solid game.  I'm told it's better with fewer players.

RATING: 7
Do NOT let the two (slightly different) versions of this game confuse or deter you from getting this gem.  I've played both versions and I think either version is perfectly fine.  It has some slight similarities with Acquire but shorter.  Some complain about game play being "obvious" but that is probably true only in your first 3 turns or so b/c it's tension-mounting (either that or they don't see the nuances at first blush).  There are several hidden strategies and board tactics and placing knights in various ways can help improve the cards that you have in your hand (so hand mgt is important or can be made important thru playing your knights).  One nasty ploy is to place knights to force an allowable cardplay onto the river section (pushing out an oppenont's duchy).  The archbishop power shouldn't be underestimated.  Everything meshes well for a very enjoyable game with extremely high interaction and great tension in under an hour.  3 or 4 players is optimal and there can be imbalanced or kingmaking potential with 5 plyrs.  The board and rules of the newer (Face 2 Face) edition is slight.  You can play with either rules set, with either edition.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Too dry for my tastes, and I didn't really find it all that enjoyable.  I expect future plays would increase the rating slightly, but I have little desire to give it another go.  On your turn you play a knight on the board that either corresponds to the number on the card you play OR you can play a card and place a reinforcement knight next to one of your current knights as long as there are no opposing knights adjacent to that space.  Each time two or more knights are in adjacent spaces, a duchy is formed and whoever has the most knights in the duchy places a duke.  As well, cities, forts, churches each contribute to the game in adding scoring and special abilities (castles provide extra defense and 1 point, cities score between 2-4 points, churches score 1 point and if you have the majority of bishops, have the special ability of the archbishop).  Dukes are worth one point for in game scoring, 5 points if they survive the game.

There's alot to like in this game. It's card driven, and while there is luck inherent ot a system like that, every card is unique, and the deck gets reshuffled fairly often, so those cards get reused. I also like the "destruction tile-esque" bastions, that can screw with other people. The archbishop function is nice, and adds another element to broaden the spectrum of this game.

Definitely not a bad game but it covers an awkward middle-ground. Rules are too complex to be a good gateway game, and too light for a gamer's game.

This game was a total surprise. I grabbed it off the 1/2 price sale table at the bookstore, based solely on Knizia's name. We find ourselves really enjoying the game. The dynamic of merging duchies is a lot of fun - trying to simultaneously figure out how to take over other's while protecting your own. The bishops add a great dynamic, allowing devilish moves when they are least expected. Overall, another solid game by the master.

Really had a good time playing this for the first time.  Though the scoring and and rules seemed fiddly at first, it is has a logical simplicity that clicks soon enough.
The structure seemed to keep the game moving, and we finished in about 1 hour.  It reminds me in some ways of a Acquire combined with a simpler Euphrat&Tigris, but the pieces and gameplay tie in the theme a little more tightly.

3-5 Players Area control. Draw-play card game. First session with 5 players fell flat. Probable cause - confusing game explanation.

The game is simple - First play a card numbered 1 to 52 corresponding to the 52 regions on the board - place a knight. Subsequent cards can used to place a new knight on the corresponding space or adjacent to any of your knights on the table. If you have two or more adjacent knights you form a Duchy.

The rest of the game, the real meat, happens when Duchies collide. 

There are several population centers on the board. These are randomly populated with castles, churches or towns. Castle boost your Duchy. Controlling the most churches makes you archbishop (with the ability to replace an existing knight with your knight by playin the correspondin region's card) and towns provide points. 

Each player has three barricades that may be placed once per game. They are permanent and they provide defense against stronger duchies or they can be used offensively to cut another duchy short - ie. prevent is from growing in a particular direction.

The game play was a bit long. All right I said it. The game is long for what it is. 

Two caveats. This was the last game played in a long game session. The rules session took 20 minutes, which in my estimation was about 15 minutes too long. There are 3 pages of rules. Presented succinctly the game explanation should be in the 5-ish minute range. 

Verdict - I'll play it again.

It was the similarities between Rheinländer and Tigris & Euphrates that made me interested in this game. The element of building and expanding your territory is very present here. However, since the duchies along the Rhine have less dimensions (strength and value) compared to the rising and falling multi-colored kingdoms of the Fertile Crescent, the decision space feels more limited. It's still a good game but I can't see why I should play this instead of Tigris & Euphrates.

Update: Sold because Tigris & Euphrates does the game of expanding territories much better.

IMO one of Knizia's better games.  As duchies build up, you need to think about your tactics while keeping an eye on the other players.  Don't underestimate the power of the castle's and try and if you have a lot of your dukes down by the end of the game you'll do well.

RATING: 6
Create dutchies and score points depending where your knights are placed. It's fun, a bit light, since someone can get many cards adjacent to castles (allowing you to place two knights at once and ending the game quicker with them placing more knights). Okay to play, but try not to view it as a strategy game since dutchies could collide without much control from your part, and the person with the priest majority can remove other player's knights. Actions are very dependent on your card draws; if there are two territories you want to connect, you may never get that card. Fun the first few times, then was less fun when there were a few game ending mechanisms (two opponents keep exchanging control of dutchies, someone joins dutchies without benefit to them, someone has many castles ending the game early).

The play of this game for me has become rather straight forward and perhaps a bit boring. Get your dukes down (on castles next to nearby 4 cities preferably), protect them with bastions or grow them out to take on other dukedoms. Keep cards that separate you from other dukedoms to keep them out of other player's hands ... unless you'll win the dukedom, in which case play them. Alter tactics to suit cards. Repeat for 60 minutes. Not one I ask for.

Acquire meets Tigris & Euphrates, perhaps?  It has some lovely Knizia touches.  The reshuffling of the deck is suspenseful.  The differing tactics for the cities, chuches and castles requires some thought.  

Its biggest flaw is that the board can be hard to read late in the game when you have sprawling duchies.  The duchies don't delineate space clearly, in the way the kingdoms of Tigris & Euphrates do.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game feels a lot like Acquire, but without the stock layer.  That is, the players actually are the "hotels" in this game instead of owning stock in them.  You're generally trying to own the most duchies in this game, so trying to merge everything willy-nilly is not a good idea.  Trying to gobble up your opponent's duchies, on the other hand, can be a good idea, provided it doesn't give them enough power inside your duchy to be able to take the whole thing back.  This game plays fast and ends fast, so don't let it catch you by surprise.

RATING: 5
S'okay.  Reminds me a bit of China, in that you can keep trying to one up each other to get points until someone gives in, but with more distractions and options. I thought the Face 2 Face components were a bit cheesy. Of course I've only played once and had no idea what I was doing for the first 1/2 of the game, and it IS pretty quick (like China).  Need to try it again, but I'm not eager to.

RATING: 6.8
Not one of my favorites though many tell me for them it is a 'hidden gem' of a game.  The art is beautiful and the components and cards are top notch.  Just a little boring.  Certainly much better than 'Chicken Cha-Cha-Cha' that I noticed is ranked a few spots ahead of Rheinlander.

RATING: 7
Update: this design may be the best in the majorities family as holdings are marked by miniature dukes, awarded for only having the most (runner up dukes are removed but rewarded money).
No need for Acquire as mergers are present in Rheinlander and no transactions to memorise. The tension of uncertainty is via the number cards held so all the pinnacle of this family of design so far.

I'm alittle biased towards this game as it reminds me of my wife and I's trip down the Rhine. But now the Rose tinted glasses have slipped and the garishness of colours confuses play (hence I purchased the toned down/bland English version) and the summing up at game end is bothersome. Still despite having more complexity of gameplay than its inspiration (Acquire), it is more forgiving with card draws, the countdown of shields adds to the tension and decision making and resolving the mergers and the winner is easier. So there you have it, Acquire-like play in half the time. Alas, the game doesn't seem to float everyone else's boat.

I've not really agreed before with comparisons between Tigris & Euphrates and Acquire, but Rheinlander feels a bit like the missing link between the two. It has the numbered-grid of Acquire and some of the feel of the internal and external conflicts of T&E.

Rating could go up or down. First game didn't seem to have opportunities for enough conflict and the next game had 2 players go at it in a fatal (for me) duel. Most of the early game depends on the luck of the draw and the game is very unforgiving of mistakes. Players not involved in parts of the board still need to be very aware of what's happening there and be prepared to place a Bastion or even a sacrificial knight (given the right card in hand). This makes it a requirement that all players are very familiar with the rules and are of equivalent gaming skills (not easy to do in multi-player games). Even the (maybe too) powerful Archbishop is fairly limited until the cards begin to be recycled. Also, where there is conflict, the 'defender' is better described as a 'victim'. Either this game doesn't really work or it has a depth I haven't yet grasped.

RATING: 6
I played a 4 player game. Enjoyed several aspects - the way you can grow territories, removes some of the luck of the draw. In the later game keeping vital cards to force territories to merge becomes important.

RATING: 8.5
This is one of the more thematic offerings from Dr. Knizia. The theme is a bit odd perhaps, but divvying up the Rhein probably is the most sensible theme for this game. It lacks the depth and elegance of the other tile-laying games he released in the same time frame, but it is still a very good game and plays quickly. Overall, I like it.

An interesting area control game. It could do with a longer playing time as we just started to get going with all the mergers of Duchies and such but maybe they tried to keep the confrontational level down. Now that I played it once I want to try it again and improve my strategy which is the hallmark of a good game, makes me want to come back. The board is not the easiest to make out but then again, at least they did not make it too abstract. Like the 'theme', that is, the setting (I used to live next to the Rhine). Another solid Knizia.

This rating is based on an incomplete game, but I think there's something here that could end up making this a hidden gem.

It's strange to find an underrated big box Knizia game, but here we are. It plays very quickly with minimal fuss, and feels a bit like Acquire played on a long line rather than a grid. It's a fascinating take on territory conquest, but one that would require more experience on my part to really nail down my opinion.

Excellent implementation of a single mechanic that creates interesting interactions..  A bit too dependent upon luck of the card draw, but it's an excellent step on the way up to E&T since it abstracts the "external conflict/war" nicely.  It's all over quickly as well.

[1 play] This is a solid area control game with nice components, easy rules, and a good amount of interesting decision making. I have concerns that the power of the Archbishop is too great, either dominated by one player, or too powerful not to become the overarching concern of successful gameplay.

I'm happy to have finally played this one, but I'm not convinced it deserves a permanent home among my collection.

RATING: 5.5
A very average and bland Kniza game.

Using numbered cards, players seed knights onto the board (along the banks of the Rhine). 2 knights form a duchy and allows the player to play a duke.

VPs are given for control of territory (castle, church, VPs) and for Dukes on the board. Each player has 3 gray blocks to place on a spot to 'block' it.

Rather bland, little interaction and static.

Initial rating. Knizia area influence/tile laying game. It's got some bite to it, which I like, but doesn't offer the same freedom found in Tigris and Euphrates (or the same intensity of conflict for that matter).

Games like Reinlander remind me why I liked Reiner Knizia's work.  For some reason why the rules tend to answer every question that you may ask, it sometimes is difficult to distiinguish between the reinforcement rules and the knight placement rules when contending with the seperate duchy rules.  

Frankly, I find this game to be quick and tense.  It keeps me right at the edge of my seat.  That said it seems to be a game best served by having at least four players to keep things competative. When you are pressed up against each other the hand management aspect of the game really becomes a joy.  There are usually a couple different ways to take advantage of what your hand gives you. I enjoy how this comes down to timing when to press the advantage.

This is a sorely under appreciated game.

Quite a fun Reiner Knizia game.  As usual, quite simple to learn the gameplay, some interesting mechanics, and some underlying strategy called for.

Reminds me of E&T in the sense that I half understand what is going on and the tile-laying and merger aspect are confusing.  Having a board that's difficult to read, especially towards the end, doesn't help in that regard either.  You can also play tiles and the number doesn't matter-you can announce a different number and lay the tile there instead!  Lastly, it reminds me of Garden Competition when, almost immediately after beginning the game, I realized it's so uninspiring that I could care less what happens, which is rare for me.  Yuck!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A tricky area-control game where the area is decided by the players so each game is different.  I've only played 3 or 4 times but it seems to have more depth than you'd think.
UPDATE: I've played a couple of games with the 2-player variant posted here and am impressed with this game more and more.  The variant is very good.  I've changed one thing, adding the 29 and 30 spaces so to include the place where the river bends back and touches itself.  This also adds another token to the board so I chose another church so as to make it an odd number.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I found myself aggravated by this game's missed chance to follow through on its purported theme just a little--the big numbers on the game "map" are so much more impersonal than using the names of real places in those spots would have been. It wouldn't have changed the game at all, just made it have a little more life. Other than that, it's typical Knizia stuff, which means not bad at all.

An interesting Acquire variant with some vintage Knizia twists. This is another one of those medium length boardgames he excels at. With the multiple ways you can use your cards, you can always do something useful, but the options are never so many that AP ensues. At another publisher, say Hans im Glück, this could have been a bigger hit than with Hasbro.

A wonderful little land-grab game. It maybe ends just a little too soon so there is perhaps not enough conflict in it, but I enjoyed the one play so far.

Update: The game seems to sometimes fall a little flat; sometimes through a lack of conflict and sometimes through a lack of players understanding what is going on, which is odd because it's far from a complex game.

When it works, it's brilliant. When it fails, it's thankfully brief.

There's a decent middle part of the game where you build stuff, expand you area, block other players. But then near the end it seems to get to a point where you need to be lucky in your card draws to do more effective things. "That whole location is his.... unless I draw a 27 or 29." I think it really needs a way that even if your card draws suck, then you can do something you need on your last few plays.

There's certainly a game here but it's just too dry, abstract and slow-moving for my tastes. If you enjoy chess or go, this may be your game. For me, the choices are too restrictive and the moves usually are tactical and reactionary (though strategy is possible). The bottom line is the game is somewhat clever and challenging but just not a lot of fun.

The deck of cards makes Rheinländer one of the most perfect battle games ever.  There is just enough luck, and just enough hope, provided by the cards to loosen the conflict and allow families to enjoy each other.  Curious roles (duchies? archbishops?) make this even more interesting.  It deserves yet another printing, with yet another try at the map.

RATING: 6
You start the game with five cards, play a card, do it's thing and draw a replacement. The game ends when someone runs out of knights (cardboard chits). The game is about putting your chits onto a board where all the spaces run along a river. When you have multiple chits in a row, a duchy is formed. Whoever has the most chits in that duchy controls the duchy. You put a miniature figure out to show that you control that duchy. There are things along the river that give you points if your duchy touches them.

The things along the river are either straight up points, castles or churches. Points are worth the value they show, ranging from 2 to 4 points. You only score for your duchies when either you lose them... when they're worth their point value, 1 point for a castle or church, and a point for the miniature duke figure (which is returned to you). If you hold the duchy at game end the scoring is similar but the duke scores five points instead of one.

In addition to points the castle and churches have some special perks. If you place your chit (knight) in front of an uncontrolled castle, then you get a free chit placement in the castle... immediately creating a duchy. But whenever someone takes that duchy from you, your chit in the castle is replaced by theirs. When you control a church, you get a bishop tile... and if you have the most you get the Arch-Bishop card... which lets you replace other people's chits when you draw the exact right card.

So on your turn you play a card and do one of two things with it. Either a) put a chit on a space with the number shown or b) reinforce an existing chit. In the former option you have a bit of a choice initially as there are usually two spaces for any number... one on either side of the river. There's also a river space but it can't be played unless the two sides of the river are already full. When you reinforce a chit, you ignore the number on the card and put a chit next to one of your chits on the board... except it can't go anywhere where it would be next to someone else's chit and it can't go in the river.

The game definitely has some strategy and some luck. If you draw the right cards, you've got an advantage. Drawing good cards early in particular can be big. But there's a bit of strategy in determining what to go after, how to do it, whether you need to stop someone from controlling too many bishops, etc. The power of the Arch-Bishop is huge in the game as it can swing control of duchies much more easily than simply attacking them directly. Being able to join duchies across a river is also often huge if you can manage it. There's also thee bastion tiles that you can play (only one per turn) once in the game to block off a space... which can be potent if you use them correctly.

The game is enjoyable, but I think that given the amount of strategy in the game, the luck factor is a little high. This is a game that I wouldn't mind playing with casual gamers or family... but if I'm going to play with real gamers there's probably other games I'd rather play. One of the people I played with called it "advanced bingo"... which I think is a bit harsh.

This game is really fun. At first it is basic and easy but than gets really hard really fast. Little luck and mostly strategy oriented. It's also interesting how the joker makes the cards re-shuffle every once in awhile. The only downside is that you have to play the cards you get so you can't play where you want to. Otherwise an excellent game.

Medium light area control game with quite some luck of the draw, but still some tactical decisions in the same vein as Acquire. Two rounds into a 5-player game, everything made sense and downtime was almost non-existent. At that point, the mixture of tactical decisions and a lucky hand (not to mention it's modest playing time) made it feel like a good family game with conflict and turn angst. It is a pity that the rules make it hard to get into for non-gamers: There are quite a lot of rules for a game of its calibre, and they are not very intuitive. Finally, the Hasbro board, while nice to look at, makes it hard to see what's going on halfway through the game.

The game itself contains many Knizia elements: Low rules overhead, scoring and placement mechanisms, etc. Placing dukes across the board is important as they worth 5 points each at game end. With four players, we never had a lot of chances to merge or take over duchies. Plus, it is often hard to get the right card to take over duchies via merger across the river. Game also ended relatively quickly. Puzzling game.

I got a quick demo of this at Origins 05, and have now played one 4 player game.  Its a cool area control game with some extra areas of conflict.  You must play a specific number card to establish an area, but can play any number to extend an area.  Castles and churches help mix things up even more, and lucky draws might allow someone to cross a river and cause sudden reversals.

There little that connects them thematically or mechanicaly, but when I played, I was reminded of Through the Desert.  I don't know if I will feel the same way after future plays, and I played Oasis right before, so maybe I had camels on the brain, but it just felt similar.  I need to expand aggresively here, expand defensively here, and I had better establish a new dutchy there before someone else does.  Pick one.

I just played it again, and the TtD comarison still holds up.  It certainly has more randomness, but the decisions throughout the game still felt similar.  Once again I failed to use my bastions correctly, and this time it cost me the win.

Rules are appealingly simple, but the strategy is a little difficult to grasp, which can put newbies at an uncomfortable distance.  Once you finally get it, it's really surprisingly fast and easy.  The bits in the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/publisher/1705]Face 2 Face Games[/url] version are appealing to the eye and facilitate gameplay well.  Gameplay is mediocre.  You need the right cards for confrontation, and even then, there's a good chance that a bastion will get built, or other duchies will form such that taking over other duchies becomes unfeasible.  If this happens in too many places, it gets to be a contest of drawing the right card.

Looks like a game I will enjoy over and over.  Took a while to understand reinforcement and didn't block as much as I should.  I can see how you either like it or don't.  Helps that I'm from Germany!   More4 conflict than I am used to in the Euro style games, but I enjoy a little conflict in my gaming sometimes, so a good change of pace.

What an odd game.  It's not quite an area control game, but it is.  If you don't have the proper reinforcements in your area, it will be difficult to build in and overtake other areas, but at first glance, it doesn't look like that much of a confrontational game.  It appears that the game would have a lot of replayability, thanks to the card draw, but at the same time, near the end of the game, it's possible for the turns to drag out as everyone is trying to figure out what to do with a worthless hand.

Rheinlander is an interesting game, but it is a bit fiddly for my tastes.  It's a bit hard to score things, especially since by the end of the game, some of the duchies end up being huge and messy.

At least once per month at our late night sessions, someone suggests that we play Rheinlander to round out the evening.  Since I'm not sure that I'd choose to play even if it were the only game in the room, I mostly pretend that I don't hear.

Oh, it's an OK play-a-card & drop-a-guy area majority game.  But there are many, many other games that I'd play over this one.  Like the "it's getting late, probably time to go home" game.

Area majority game that is more confrontational than most. My rating is after just one real play so it is tentative. Seems interesting, I hope that I get to play it more.

This played pretty well with 3. With 4 it was very balanced and very few duchys were overrun. Hopefully 5 player is the magic number.

Relatively light and quick area control game with a feel similar to Big Boss or Acquire.  I like it.  The reinforcement move seems awefully easy at first but it is clearly balanced by other factors and is hard to use late in the game.  This strikes a good balance between depth and length and is quite enjoyable.

The design of the game board is awkward, as it leaves insufficient space for the dukes. The meandering of the river also makes it difficult at times to make out the duchies. A number of the components seem over-produced, e.g. Archbishop and Dukes.

Gameplay is quick, though somewhat dependent on the luck of the card draw. Theme is somewhat thin. There is player interaction, and can sometimes be a "take that" kind of interaction. Scalability is suspect, especially with lower player counts.

dirt simple "play one card on your turn" type game, the board is a little confusing but not too bad

RATING: 6
Feels very much like a variation of Tigris & Euphrates in terms of placement strategies, but a dash of Dragonland oddities for scoring. Enjoyed the game, but also felt that luck of the draw could play a significant factor, especially at the end of the game when more spaces are occupied and fewer cards present positive, valuable options.

RATING: 6
I like a lot of what Rheinlander has to offer.  Trying to play your hand of cards well to build defendable duchies worth solid points is quite interesting.  Unfortunately there is no luck mitigation when it comes to how you merge duchies (the "attack" of the game) and that kept me and my group from enjoying this one as much as we might have.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
In my mind what really makes Rheinlander stand out is the method of placing your knights as well as the ability to convert your opponents as the archbishop.  The only real downside is the totally random card draw, which could cause some unexpected results as one duchy is absorbed by another.  Plays relatively quick and often seems to end rather inconveniently (which I haven't decided whether it's a good thing or not).

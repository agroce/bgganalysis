My wife and I played this a couple of times. I know I need to give it more tries but my initial reaction was that some of the rules were fiddly and overly busy. I Kickstarted this so I have enough content to last me a life time. Just not inspired to get it back to the table soon.

RATING: 10
First playthrough took nearly 4 hours due to having to refer to the rules often but it only felt like 2 hours such was the immersion and speed of play.

A really good, atmospheric dungeon crawl with a 1930s pulp fiction theme covering all sorts of stories from raiding Egyptian pyramids trying to stop an immortal evil pharaoh taking over the world to defeating cultists bent on raising the Old Gods.

Great components, a diverse array of modular room tiles containing traps, secret passages, and artifacts.  A good selection of adventurers with their own unique skills and equipment with many more items to be found and a horde of enemies to fight, this game has a lot of replayability in the base box with a bunch of expansions that add much more choice including more rooms, quests and monsters as well as a campaign mode, personal quests and a traitor mechanic.

One of the best dungeon crawl experiences I've had so far, this will be taking over from Descent 2e for me.  A massive plus for it being fully co-operative up to 6 players and also including a special character and companions to allow you to play solo without having to track multiple adventurers.

One of the expansions also contains the rules for an epic campaign, linking all the expansions (or any combination of them) into a truly great experience with character progression and an interesting story arc.  This game really is amazing.

Un juego 100% recomendable. Recuerdas cada partida como si se tratase de una película. Es imposible que dos partidas sean iguales. Ya no solo por la cantidad de sucesos aleatorios que se producen, o por el mapa modular que vas explorando con tus personajes. A eso hay que sumarle que cada aventura es diferente de las anteriores por lo que nunca sabes lo que te vas a encontrar en un episodio hasta que lo juegas. Los personajes también son bastante diferentes unos de otros, cada uno tiene su propio estilo y personalidad por lo que, aun repitiendo la misma aventura, la forma de jugarla puede cambiar totalmente de un personaje a otro.

RATING: 10
After playing several scenarios I have to say that I really like this game. This game is Arkham Horror, Fortune & Glory and somewhat Mansions of madness 2nd edition mixed together into a dungeon crawler.

+ Cool Sense of exploration - one of the best in the genre
+ story Focus works very well and is very motivating
+ lootIng and killing for the Soul Monger motivates very much as well
+ showdowns between bosses are great
+ character development via attribute updates and items
+ tons of addons (more traps, elite missions)

- difficulty is very swingy
- no tactical depth - this game is about theme and exploration and less about tactical combat etc.
- some of the Artwork is very amateurish  (but I like this style)
- typos or unclear paragraphs

Secrets of the lost tomb is great. I love the exploration and the scenario driven nature of it. It captures the feeling of Arkham Horror in dungeon crawl format. If you like skill checks, encounter cards and story focused gameplay, you really should check this game out.

A modern classic.

I played a prototype of this at Metatopia 2013. Great fun. Reminds me of Fortune and Glory but on a modular board. Purely cooperative. Great theme and great execution; I can't wait to see it in full form. Hard to tell from one game how much replay ability there will be, but I predict a lot. My only real complaint is that the conflict resolution mechanism is, like all games of this sort, really simple and doesn't really involve choices-roll dice, hope you rolled well enough. Still, I predict this will be one of my favorite games.

Update: have owned this for a while (backed the kickstarter), finally got it to the table. The game is... really clunky, and does not sell the theme well. Everything feels disconnected, like it's all just unrelated things happening, not a cohesive single story. The mechanics aren't interesting, either, and are very fiddly.

Not the worst game I've played.  Another typical Amerithrash co-op where you have lots of bits, lots of fiddly rules, and lots of dice rolling.  Not really my style of game and getting sick of them honestly.

I would prefer to play this over other games like Arcadia Quest, SDE, etc... but I'd rather just play a Euro or abstract game.  Heck, I think I'd rather play a war game.

RATING: 6.5
A good game, a step up from Betrayal in terms of complexity while still not being too hard, although I think the inclusion of a healer on our team made the game MUCH easier.  It is very fiddly and the rules are good but not great so it's easy to see it's a kickstarter game.  However I do have to knock it down half a point for how punishing the status ailments can be.  There is one status effect, jinxed, that makes it so you can't use rerolls or improve your odds and you only succeed on 6's.  This made my character useless, and during the final boss fight no less, and so I just sat there an healed each round being unable to do anything successfully.

Wow. Really enjoyed this play through. Had a super busy week and work, and just wanted to play this when I got home. It fills a similar niche like [thing=15987]Arkham Horror[/thing]--random stories happen to your chracters and you have find a way to survive--except toss in an exploration dungeon crawl on three levels that is always changing. This will not be for everyone, but like Arkham Horror, this sure is for me. At least after 1 solid play. The combat is a little cumbersome--adding and subtracting different numbers for critical hits and defense, but it does work, and once I've played a few times, I don't think it will hinder gameplay much, merely slow it down a little (I very much appreciate the simple combat in Arkham Horror). Love the Health and Audacity dials (why don't more games use these dials!), and the courage track is a really neat invention with positive and negative affects--I do worry that the cardboard ARM Overlay won't last long with all the Courage Peg Action. Greatly disappointed with the miniatures--glad I didn't fork over additional money for additional minis. Rules and basic editing could have used several more revisions (as with many Kickstarter games).  Overall, greatly enjoy.

2nd edition. Very heavy box - lots of stuff in here.  Was not expecting all the small sized cards. Was forced to use non-matte Fantasy Flight sleeves for those. Slippery as hell, unlike my usual matte Dragon Shields.

Pros: great theme, replay ability,choices, and game play.

Cons: not enough dice, dice are hard to read, the box is a little thin, small card text is really hard to read, and rule book needs a slight polish.

I will be picking up the expansions on  the next kick starter.

Sigh....another crappy, fiddly bloated Dungeon Crawler. The combat is atrocious! Gather your dice roll. Count successes that is you defense, compare to the he monster card to see if you take Damage. Compare again to his defense to see if he takes damage, make sure you double the critical Damage! Add all the DRMs to see determine if you killed the monster or not. I want an adventure, instead I get boring counting and math. Designers need to simplify their games and give us more in our heads while we play then just counting and math!

What I want to do is explore an adventure have a great experience...what I end up doing is roll dice and check dice rolls with many other numbers. They should have called this DRM: The Board Game (Dice Roll Modifier) You spend your time rolling dice, comparing, then adding 2, minus 1, double and finally after a few calculations you determine if you killed the monster or not.

With so many elegant and streamlined games who has time for this? When will designer learn that we want to play a game not do homework! I'm throwing this garbage away and spend my time playing a game that puts a story inside my head instead of counting and performing too many tiny math calculations.

This is it! This is the last game I waste money on. I will not buy any game until I have played it first. I'm tired of buying expensive junk!

Aside from the disjointed feeling of the artwork between different adventures, maybe even partially in the same adventures, and the mocked up Photoshop feel of the Text (bevels, outer glows, etc) does feel a bit underrated graphically, I am really looking forward to this game and I can't wait to own it. I am a big fan of tile based exploration games similar to Betrayal at House on the Hill, etc. I'm not sure yet on the depth will be there (running the same adventures over and over, providing the fresh replay-ability). I know it will for a while, especially picking up all of the adventure expansions. I love the themes and I look forward to playing the completed game.

This felt like the designers refused to give up any of their ideas, regardless of if those ideas ended up adding to the game.  For example, there are way too many status types, and they are on double-sided cards (with different statuses on either side -- a cost savings measure?).  The result is that you have to search through the status deck each time, bringing the game to a halt.

Some components and mechanics are unnecessarily complex and fiddly.  For example, the character overlay, while "fancy" just creates something to constantly fiddle with and when placed as instructed, it covers needed information on the character card.  Simple Audacity, Health, and Courage tokens could've replaced this. 

The Courage system is a mess.  You have to track which monster (of a possible 10) that you have encountered before (with up to 4 other players also encountering monsters) because you only lose Courage the first time you encounter a given monster ("Wait, did I attack that last round or was that you?").  Then you might gain some Courage back when the monster is killed, but you might not if you're not still in that room.  This could've been so easily simplified with only some monsters possibly dealing Courage damage.  Then gain Courage when you see a monster die, and each character has a simple, short Courage Track on their sheet (tracked with a cube or token, not a peg that doesn't fit well in most of the holes!).  No tracking of monsters encountered before.  Simple.  Streamlined.  Still accomplishes the same thing.

The dice are numbered 1-6 but for some reason are on custom d12s that are difficult to read due to bad color choices and messing painting.  Only 8 dice are included, but you'll often have to roll many more than that (in our first game, one player needed to roll 18 dice at one point; rare perhaps but it does happen), meaning that you have to account for your rolls and then reroll the same dice again.  A larger quantity of generic d6s would've sufficed (probably at a lower cost) and wouldn't have taken anything from the experience.  Simple.  Streamlined.  Still accomplishes the same thing.

Searching is performed by rolling off a table in the rulebook and is also dependent on a token that you keep by your character and have to rotate periodically (how the token is currently rotated tells you which search table to roll against).  The token has no thematic meaning, just adds more steps to the round and additional components to track.  It seems like searching could've been more easily accomplished with an icon/number on the room tile and then a single roll against that information.  Some rooms are easier to search, some provide better items, lower levels have higher risk-reward.  Simple.  Streamlined.  Still accomplishes the same thing.

The graphic design is poor on many components, making them difficult to read.  Not to mention all the typos and rules issues.

And on and on.  The game could've been streamlined significantly and been something fresh and fun instead of tedious and frustrating.  I honestly have a hard time believing it was playtested with anyone outside the designers' inner circle.  This game is one of my biggest disappointments.

An ok game. Don't bother with the mini's, they're not very good. I don't think it would be very good for repeated game play. Once you play a scenario you've seen it all. You can always play on a harder level, but it is still the same. Had to drill out the holes on the ARM's so peg would fit. I would rather play Fortune and Glory.

I am a heavy board game player, usually Euro Games or games like Arkham Horror. I played this game over the weekend and met the designer Chris at one of my game groups in New Jersey. Played this game and loved it. It reminds me very much of Indiana Jones meets HP Lovecraft... lots of cool creepy story lines, awesome and rich characters and very very cool artwork... The Game play seems really smooth and fast turn around between turns (Unlike Arkham) and lots of the organization in the game works really well (such as the symbols and other colored stuff) im really excited for this game and cant wait for the kickstarter coming up!

The story of this game is ridiculous.  It's a mashing together of pretty much every pulp action genre going, and thats a good thing.  I love immersive games with well written stories and settings, but I also love how you can't help but treat this one like you're on the set of a low budget action movie, fighting undead zombie dinosaurs in a Pyramid in the Caribbean.  

It's also a very fun game to play, similar in it's gameplay to Betrayal at House on the Hill (without the betrayal part), but with some lesser seen gameplay mechanics.  I love the character cards, with the stat dials and courage counter, especially since I hate having too many tokens in a game to track everything.  

The only thing that let this game down for me was the build quality.  I have what I believe is the 2nd edition, with all card pieces instead of models.  This is fine, but the severe amount of spelling/grammar mistakes in the rule books, as well as the fact that the rule books covers were switched the wrong way round, gave me cause for concern when first setting up a game.  Additionally, two different character cards had the identical Bio printed on the reverse.  Fortunately, the enjoyment from the game itself outweighs its poor manufacturing or obsurd storylines.

Don't take this game seriously and you'll have a lot of fun playing it many times over.

This two biggest issues with this game are the art design which is hard to look at and how badly the instructions are written. The game play was similar to other dungeon crawlers and didn't really bring anything original to the genre. I'd rather just play Descent, Hero Quest or Arcadia Quest.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Stable "dungeon crawl" game with generally nice components. The ability upgrade tokens are too tiny, and the monster cards are fairly flimsy since they are meant to double as monster stand-ups. The concept of using the cards, however, does allow a large variety of adversaries and easy integration of new monsters. The combat system is somewhat convoluted. I picked up the 2nd edition because I heard about the poor quality of the 1st edition rulebooks. That said, my rulebook doesn't contain page numbers. The mechanics lead to tons of dice chucking, especially during the final duel. Another shortfall is the fact that the basic game lacks campaign capability. Furthermore as you move through the scenario book, the adventures become filled with excess rules, and it became cumbersome to learn pages of new rules to play one scenario. In the end, SotLT is an enjoyable, thematic game with good capability for variety in monsters, characters and scenarios. The aforementioned shortcomings create a mediocre game.

I wanted so badly to love this game. I love Indiana Jones, pulp adventure, mythology, the supernatural, legendary monsters, etc so the theme of this game was right in my wheelhouse. I backed the project at the Glory Seeker level so I was all in and waited with unbridled anticipation for it to arrive. Sadly, I was greatly disappointed once it did.

Maybe it's just because what the game turned out to be didn't mesh with my expectations. I don't know, but I didn't find this game fun to play at all. I found it overly long, overly fiddly and overly complicated. With 3-4 hour game play, placing tiles and rolling handfuls of dice got awfully repetitive. Add to that the hour-plus spent trolling FAQs and BGG forums looking for the answers to dozens of questions not covered in the rulebook. That certainly didn't help to elevate my feelings on the game. 

There are some neat thematic elements to the game and a ton of material to play through, but after four hours of playing, any semblance of theme got lost for me. After trudging through two plays of this game, I found myself feeling like I never wanted to play it again. It just felt too much like a chore to me.

This is an Indiana Jones version of the D&D adventure games, or Betrayal in House on Haunted Hill without the betrayal. What I'm saying is the game is a little derivative.

I wanted to like this game. But it suffers from rules inconsistencies, typos in the rules and on the components, components that are referenced but aren't included, overly fiddly mechanics, not nearly enough dice included, over-produced and unnecessary components while others are underproduced.  And I'm not convinced that it was playtested fully.  There's some good here with the story-telling elements and some of the mechanics, but in the end it was way too fiddly and I experienced more aggravation than fun.

Secrets of the Lost Tomb is a love letter to games like Eldritch Horror and Betrayal at House on the Hill. The rule book isn't that great, but because I'm familiar with those aforementioned games, I was able to get my feet wet very quickly. The theme is very strong, even if it's a little hokey that you might find Mt Olympus and El Dorado in the same tomb. The scenarios help focus the narrative really well, and I like that the game is more exploration-based than combat-driven. This was a bit of a surprise, but I walked away really satisfied. This won't hit the table that often, but it joins the ranks of games like Arkham Horror and Albion's Legacy for me; Games that really feel like RPGs in board game form.

This seems to be a well-designed, but very slow and cumbersome game.  To my thinking, it combines the worst elements of playing D&D for the first time with a bad "Choose Your Own Adventure" novel.

That said, I know that this is purely a preference, and there are others who would likely love this game.  In short, it is a slow game that does not seem to require much in the way of thought/planning/strategy, considering the amount of time involved.

Your mileage may vary, but I hated it.

Had fun, but only because the people I played with were fun. It felt like an early prototype of Betrayal, before someone had stripped out the dead wood. I think there's a good game here potentially, some nice ideas. I liked the courage mechanic.

Played solitaire in order to learn the game, not with the single solitaire character, but with multiple characters. Definitely needed the 2016 FAQ as a number of the cards are either printed with errors or need clarification. 

Enjoyed it a lot, good thematic feel.  I lost the first game with 4 characters, but won the next with 3 characters.  Playing with 3 is a good way to learn because they all start with a companion; this makes it easier as well as helping to get used to the companion rules.

I've since played once with two of my regular group.  Again we won the initial scenario, but not without one player having to regenerate a new character after an untimely demise.  I'm not sure the others were entirely convinced about the game, but I've since bought the Fate's Fortune expansion which may add more appeal to some with the element of competition.

Secrets of the Lost Tomb is a very thematic game in an action adventure kind of way.  It's a game that will always tell a good story.  It a good solitaire game for those that enjoy solo gaming.  

It's huge (I have the 1st Edition box) and the base game has a ton of content to keep you busy for a long time.  If that isn't enough for you pick up one or more of the several available expansions and enjoy.

It's compared to a cross between the horror theme and gameplay of Eldritch Horror and the random tile map of Betrayal at House on the Hill. Haven't played Betrayal but I love modular tiles. But SotL is more thematic and more fun than EH. EH is a more polished and professionally produced game, but at least solo, gameplay feels mechanical and I can't wait for a game to finish. The scripted story scenarios in SotL gives a much more immersive adventure. I'd much more rather play SotL than EH. But the SotL quality control on the production is horrible and feels rushed to release. Rulebooks have both printing and editing errors. Card texts are way too small. Creases on the cards. So many issues with the components quality...

It took me 2 hours to unbox this beast of a game.
As much as it is good its counters are very small, the same could be said about the cards font.

As for the game itself, if Fortune and Glory is Indiana Jones in a box, I think of this more as Tomb Raider at the House-Tomb on the Hill.

The game handles the theme very well and it's a pretty fun dungeon crawl. There are a ton of playable characters to choose from, which is really cool too. Success often revolves around dice rolls, which is not a mechanic that everyone enjoys, but we had quite a bit of fun with our first game and certainly plan on playing it more.

I have not played Secrets of the Lost Tomb, but had horrible customer service trying to get a refund on a pre-order I had made on the game.  I may have given this game a second look after it had hit retail, but at this point I am done with this game system or anything else released by Everything Epic Games.

My brother Kickstarted this and has a butt ton of stuff for it, so I feel like I owe it to him to play it again at least one more time.  But the game was such a mush mash of themes that it was ridiculous. We were trying to stop an ancient mummy in a pyramid that had risen out of the ocean, but we encountered everything from dinosaurs, to the stables of Hercules.

Misprinted rules and scenario books. I HATE THAT! I think everything is in the box, although the component list is also full of "misprints". One die has no color on half of its sides - making it almost useless. Quality is overall crappy. I purchased a boxed game but got something that is bad even by kickstarter standards. Let's hope it plays better than it looks, or it will be left rotting in the shelves.

Unfortunantely it does not play that well. It's almost "broken" in some respects.

This game is a little complex, there is a lot going on.  It is not too difficult, just complex.  The game takes a long time to play, but you don't get bored and if you die or run away, you get to just grab a new character and come back in.

The game is very fun and I like it a lot.  Campaign mode is very fun so far. I expect this will be fun solo too.

The strength of the game is the pulp nature and the adventure elements.  Do note that the adventure elements pull in events and monsters from every genre, with no good theme tying them together, especially when you mix in the expansions like I have done.  For some players, that might be a turn-off.

Play with 4 or less players.  With 5 or 6 players, there is too much downtime.  For some players like me, that's fine, since I'm enjoying the events play out.  But for many players, that's too much.

Also with more adventurers, the number of soul shards will be spread out so your ability to upgrade at the Soul Monger decreases. This is partially mitigated by the extra shards you get when in the same room as the adventurer who makes the killing blow.

Realize the game will take a long time.  So far they are averaging about twice the length of the time listed on the scenario.  That can be sped up by splitting up various game state tasks, but so far we haven't done that well enough.

Very fun co-op game. It's a little tough to get into, but once you understand the game its really fun and has a LOT of replayability. Sometimes the randomness of the cards doesn't mesh up well with the theme (like American revolutionary war ghosts showing up in a Japanese tomb), but the game is very strong thematically.

An outstanding entry in the dungeon crawl arena.  The theme is superior, and the mechanics help to draw you in without being over-bearing.  The are plenty of rules problems, but that's pretty much to be expected with a complex game such as this.  I've played three of the adventures so far, and they have all be quite different, as well as engaging.

First advice though... throw away the 12 siders that come with it, and pull out your favorite 6 siders.  Makes a huge difference in enjoyability.

Seems to scale well with differing numbers of players.

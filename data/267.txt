GAME: Tycoon
RANK: 2116
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Economic game with a decent theme and very limited actions.

Turns involve obtaining a loan, which must be paid back with interest, or flying to a  city around the world (providing you've purchased the appropriate ticket), and building a hotel (which earns income), building a factory (which earns income in a different fashion), or renovating a hotel (which is sometimes necessary to re-establish area majorities or for distribution scoring).  There are no points per se, it's all about spending money to make more money.  You get income from factories, from hotels, and from being widely distributed amongst the different cities.  

Payouts occur at the end of each round, with debts having to also be paid at that time (unless you choose to extend your loan(s)).  You'll never go bankrupt as you can always take more loans, but by the end of the game you might end up with little to money that way.  The game is fairly light, but there are some tough decisions, as you have to manage your money, which is tight early on, plan your flying routes, and decide which battles to fight, and which money strategies to pursue.  The fact that you can only do one thing per turn ensures that the turns will be quick and leaves you with the feeling of wanting to do more.

Played dozens of times, and never the same twice. Games are always hotly-contested and almost always close between the top two or three scores. After repeated playings more depth and potential tactics just seem to reveal themselves. You can play "on instinct" and still win. While it does seem hard to catch the leader after round two, it is nonetheless possible. Fast and playable. Don't understand why it's not more popular.

not too pretty, but suprisingly good. after i game i am a little bit sceptical though if there are winning strategies, but i simply do not see them, or if most everything is decided by which cities others happen to build the most... a bit longish (our first game took ~2hours), if this was an 1h game i'd play it often surely

This is probably the best game you can get for under 10 dollars.  I just don't get why the value is so low for such a quality game.  There is definately a little learning curve which, until reached, can produce some runaway leaders.  Once everyone "gets it", the game produces a good level of decisions and conflict.

Pretty good economic area majority game. The rules are easy to understand. But to use these simple rules to make the best and most efficient choices is a whole different matter. Game is challenging and (in the beginning) money can be really tight. But don't be affraid to spend it. To make money you have to spend money. The different ways to make money offer some varied strategies. The fact they all seem well ballanced is a compliment to the design. Another plus is that the game has very little downtime and plays relatively quick. And to my mind this implementation makes more sense themewise than the El Capitan version. Very happy to own it.

Played again after many years, with three.  Really dug the game!  It's tough and tight the first two rounds.  You have to take loans but the key is making sure you are able to pay those off and not carry them over.

3 plays online.  Not sure if the game is good, but it's interesting for now.  So much arithmetic, and once you get a handle on it, a flip-flop occurs...your profits crest (2nd round) and fall (3rd round).  The standard opening play seems to be staying at home-base to get a big loan at the start, then extend that loan (as crazy as it sounds).  You can easily re-coup the exhorbitant loan extension rate with the large profits of the mid-game, and there are crucial plays such as buying the tie-breaking first or second "never-need-to-renovate" hotels.  Not all cities are created equal in payouts so avoid the cheap cities until the mid- or late-game.  I have yet to figure out exactly how the scheduled flight tickets work... the online version of this game lets you stop & stay at your first "lay-over" city.

Solid mix of a business game with area control. It is one of those games where the possible actions on a turn are just too much for you to think about all at once so you have to muddle your way through as best you can. I didn't like the way that the start player was always the same. There are definite advantages and disadvantages to going first and last and to have the same players having these throughout the game seems unbalancing.

Reviewed here: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/22018/user-review

The first game that I sold, but then rebought, and that in and of itself is a strong compliment.

Typical of Kramer the different scoring strategies (factories, expensive properties, diversity) are all seemingly well-balanced and the choices are tight. I love the way the value of hotels rise and then start to fall coupled with the obsolescence of the earlier ones, which dramatically affects the scoring mechanism and makes the game memorable. Surprised this game is so 'under the radar' here, very fun area influence game  and cheap if you're patient.

I initially rated this an 8, but then dropped it to 7 and sold my original copy of it. The game is back in my collection again, and up to 8 again though. The initial drop in the rating came about because I was unfairly comparing it to some of the heavier AIG that I was playing at the time. The thing that makes Tycoon solid for me is the number of tough decisions it offers while still having relatively clean rules and a fast playing time. It's not as meaty as a Liberte or King & Intrigue Grande, but it doesn't have to be, and since it plays in half the time, it is much more likely to make it to my table anyway.

Very good with 4, much less tight with 3, forget about it with 2. With 3 spreading is probably on the dominant side as it is much harder to stop, with 4 the strategies seem roughly balanced.

I prefer playing with an accidental variant where the tickets bought are automatically refreshed. This decreases ticket stagnation and can occasionally encourage speculative charter flight purchases more.

Aside: this was later re-issued as El Capitan. I initially looked at that game, but have preferred to not even try it as it takes the base game here, clutters it up with extra rules that just aren't needed, and vastly increases the value of the "spread em out" strategy which was already plenty viable in this original game. I know people complain about the aesthetic of this one, but say what you will, it's clean, easy to see what is going on, and that goes double for the rules set which is straight-forward and doesn't add extra rules (only build 3 hotels in a row, mayn't take a loan on the first turn, &c.) that increase rules overhead for no good reason.

Very good game of business investment in Hotel and Factories in 9 cities around the world. Better than Aquire or Shark in my opinion. The decisions about hotels verses factories and which cities to invest in are well done. Played this again and it was even better this game is really awesome. The decisions and strategies are really excellent. You must try it. Bumping this to a nine.

If you don't know what you're doing the first round, the economy can be absolutely brutal. We had a couple players who were taking out loans to cover loans. It was amazing to see, however, how they were able to work with other players to make a dramatic turnaround. I really like these sort of competitive/cooperative games. Really glad I was able to pick this up.

Production: Overall a functional yet not attractive production.  Play: One of the funner budgeting games I've played, that feels challenging, rather than like work.  It is an interesting twist on the area control mechanism to make it so difficult to navigate around the different areas.  I enjoy the price increases and breaking points of the different cities, and that hotels decay.  This title seems a precursor to Kramer's action-point quartet, each of which features area control with difficult-to-reach areas.  (1+1+3) (1 play)

RATING: 5
The primary attraction in this area majority game is the way property values aren't static but rise and fall depending on how much people populate them. I'm not much of an area majority fan but I do like that concept. The other notable element is that you can't just go where you want; you have to purchase plane tickets to get there to drop one of your hotels or factories. Doing that requires a) the right cards available to you and b) money (which is victory points). Lastly, hotels decay and get booted so your position is not guaranteed to be permanent. Money is very tight, at least early on and requires you to "fly home" and basically spend a whole turn. 

I like all those elements, and overall it should be a great game but it comes out as just an OK one for me. I think the board needs some variability and the rules need some tweaking. Taking a loan on the first turn is a must (so it's not really a decision) and cards should be refreshed to give people more options. From what I've read, El Capitan addresses those areas and makes improvements. Still, I prefer this theme to that one, and I've heard a lot of complaints about the legibility of that one's board. 


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This turns out to be much simpler than it looks, and is an okay progression game. Looking back, I think I misread the game. I seemed to spend a lot of time off the board taking loans, only to spend half the money getting back on the board. But I should have spent more time building in a few cities earlier, then travelled more later. The production on Tycoon shows why German publishers are ahead, and maybe why they passed on this Kramer game. The theme has nowt to do with the game, it just doesn't feel anything like you're building hotel chains. With all the paper money floating back and forth, the mechanics could have done with some work. i might improve my rating with another play, and I'm not dismissing it, but Tycoon will take a while to hit my table again.

One of my favorite Kramer games. It's big and it's ugly, but it's a lot of fun. Money is extremely tight (plane tickets can cost as much as a hotel!) and you can never do everything you NEED to. Hopefully someone reprints this soon and gives it a facelift.

just received on 2-17-05. Finally got to the table this evening (12-15-06) for 2 games. First game was confusing with little idea of what to do. The second game was much better but still not perfect. I think that this game needs to grow on you. More plays probably will result in better play. Does the game get a chance to be played a few more times. Yes I think so. So the rating after 2 will be a 6. Room to both go up and go down.

An area majority game in which theme and gameplay are well matched, even if the toy shop artwork doesn't encourage you to take it seriously. The rules aren't complete or easy to reference, so check out the rules forums here for the inevitable questions.

Astonishingly this can be bought on Ebay for very little money.

Not a bad influence game but no Grande to which it is often compared due to when it came out, designer, genre & scoring is similiar. Tickets can limit your strategy and movement on the board somewhat, sometimes the ticket you really need won't come up so you just have to go somewhere else while you wait. Deeper than it first appears however which makes it challenging and worth playing but it wouldn't get picked over some others and it does feel a little repetitive

This feels somewhat like El Grande (not my favorite game) but I've played this twice live and numerous times online and so have a good feel for the game. The cards play a factor and add some luck to the game. That luck can swing the game a bit but a good player can overcome that. All in all, I decided to trade simply because I never have a hankering to play it and no one in my game group had even heard of it. It was tough for me to let go of it since it's OOP and a good game, but in the end I did it anyway.

While Tycoon is playable it is not well balanced. The first player has an enormous advantage and early factories combined with hotels in Monaco or New York are critical. If the payouts were changed and the two city tickets were less expensive and more plentiful the game would improve. A large number of the comments on this game are glowing and yet they say it is overlooked. I think there are far better economic games available. More playtesting was needed before publication which is a shame because it could have been very good.

A VERY solid Kramer game. Rating may rise from a 7 with further play, as there are alot of nice twists, yet the randomness of the tickets can force you into spending more than you planned, thereby weakening the game a tad.

Update: This rose to a 9, then back to an 8 as El Capitain trumps it in every way.

Funny.  I knew all along I would enjoy this one.  Kramer has a lot of great games and this one is no slouch.  It is simpler - using $$$ instead of VP, the board is a bit gaudy, and so forth, but the game itself is very, very clever.  I really liked playing it and wish I had it myself.  Some day...  Hey, I got it.

This game is a bit dry; there isn't a lot of flavour.  It reminds me of something that would have been sold by MB or Parker Brothers in the late 70's.  But the game is designed by Kramer and it is a good one to boot.  It is probably a good idea to take a loan right off the hop.

Excellent area-control game where you need to draft cards in order to fly to the various cities you want to build in.  There's a bit of an optimization puzzle mixed in with the hope that you'll get to build where you want to.  Regardless, you'll need to be clever and flexible.

A great game worthy of many more accolades than it receives. In my opinion one of the best economic games there is. Deserves to be considered along with Acquire as one of the best economic classics.

Has a very nice balancing mechanism that "ages" the value of properties... several paths to victory... competition for prime real estate properties... and just enough luck in terms of the card draw mechanisms that the game plays differently every game. 

In my opinion the game has great replayability and if you get a chance to play the game... play it once to learn the strategies and then again to appreciate the balance and efficiency of the gaming mechanisms.

This game does not seem to be well advertised, but it is a good game. Theme is based on owners flying around 9 different cities building hotels and factories. Points are awarded for first and second place majorities in hotels, factories give points equal to second place majorities, except the longest chain of hotel gives first place money for the factory. Think of it as an area control game, but less problems with it then others (eliminating tokens). Different strategies are possible (concentrate in a few cities or spread yourself in many cities). I wonder if the first player has an advantage, being able to pick cheap airline tickets. We need to play this game more.

Fantastic economic game that doesn't feel like a copy of the pivotal 3M finance simulations or Cartel: there is a certain amount of rules in here (especially bearing in mind the crisp rulesets for Acquire, Venture and Executive Decision) but the board is so well constructed that the player never feels lost. Furthermore, several factors need to be balanced (availability and price of flight tickets, hotels and factories, lengths of hotel chains) without an overwhelming amount of options for either; this gives Tycoon the typical multilayered feel of the best German games. Though, while the game does have a tactical component it's most notable that the players need to take even more care of their own planning than of the rival's, since the resources can get very, very tight (the rounds before payoff tend to be rather tense).

It's an absolute pity that this very robust game was overlooked for the more spectacular Tikal, since it's shorter, more compact and less luck dependant - therefore ultimately more rewarding.

RATING: 6.5
A very under-recognised game with a sound and simple economic engine. Perhaps a little bit one-directional: focussing on over-developing one city early on is the only way to feasibly win, but a clever little design for all that. Sadly let down by nasty cheap plastic components and corporate-Powerpoint-standard card art. Quite signicant down-time, too.

Money is very very tight for the first two turns, then you’re aflood for the third. I've tried a hotel only strategy to control the scoring rounds. I've also tried multiple loans from the start and went factories first (to score each round) and then visit all 9 cities, and this strategy also worked. What didn't work was a strategy to pay off my 1 loan after phase 1 and try and get by without more loans. You really need big cash to get to and develop the high cash earning cities as they emerge as a result of multi-player investment. It’s a nice majorities game with an age-removal twist where the normal problems of majorities games (king-making, ganging up, etc) are dissipated because of the high cost of moving between areas here.

In this game, you're trying to move your pawn around to nine different cities, building hotels to try to achieve majorities.  The catch is, moving is very expensive, and building in cities where other player's pawns are can be more expensive.  Everything pays out in income, and you have to take out loans and manage debt.  All-in-all, it's a decent game, but the loans can be very frustrating.  The bigger cities seem somewhat overpowered, too.

RATING: 6.5
Better game than is suggested by its cover. However, people who get a bad turn of luck get punished rather harshly, as having to take out another loan means:
1) Spending money on interest
2) Spending a turn on taking the loan
3) Spending money on a expensive ticket to get back on the board.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a neat money management/area control game with some tension. Involves some hard decision making, but as in other area control games, your careful plans could unravel due to chaos created by other players' unexpected actions. The area control mechanics is very good and different from most other games I've seen. Money is very tight and its proper management is the key to winning the game.

RATING: 2
There is something critical wrong with this game. The first player has an advantage. The second player less so. God help the fourth player especially if the cards are bad. I don't mind luck in a game (hell, I like Risk) but there is far too much that depends on the random draw of cards. (Note all of the house rules listed for compensating for this.) When the random card draw is coupled with playing third or fourth it becomes something beyond painful. Randomness in a beer and pretzels game is acceptable, even expected. Critical randomness in such a serious effort is unforgivable. Kramer has designed some great games; this is simply poor - possibly the worst he has ever done.

This is one that I'm on the fence about. I really didn't care for El Capitan, but I keep thinking that in a different theme it might be better.

Strangely abstract economic game.  Well done.  At first I thought that it was just a math equation that felt a bit deterministic.  But, after multiple plays this game has really grown on me.  I still am terrible at it, but I have learned to appreciate the design.  And what do you know...It's fun.  

UPDATE: After a number of games under my belt I've really grown fond of it.  I've gotten to the point where the decisions seem much clearer, and so that you don't have to take into account all the options as you know what to look for as good moves.  Still, nothing is writ in this game.

UPDATE: This has grown to be a real favorite of mine.  Lots of rewards for good planning.

This was a game I'd never heard of, but was a suggestion of Macieks, which usually are interesting. Tycoon is a game from 1998 and boy does it look it. The board itself looks like something I could whip up in photoshop in about five minutes. And the cards are very simplistic. I hear this has been reimplemented as El Capitan which looks better.

In the game, there are nine cities on the board and you must do one of three things. Build a hotel, build a factory or take a loan. In order to do so, you either stay where you are and build in that city or travel and build in the new city. There are two spots where you can build hotels in each city. Every city has a different cost to build in, with the first build spot being cheaper and the second slightly more expensive. If there's not an available spot, then you can't build there. There's also two spots for factories (which are more expensive). A city can only have two factories but there's spots for about 15 hotels or so.

You start off the board and must purchase plane tickets to travel between cities. There's two types of tickets. The first type are expensive ones which can bring you in from off the board to the listed city, or fly you directly to the listed city from anywhere on the board, or just move you x steps around the board (where x is up to three depending on the ticket). The second type are cheaper but only let you move between the two cities listed. You can buy tickets at the start of your turn and can buy as many as you want. You can also use as many as you want, but once you build something you can't move again.

Building hotels does a couple of things. First it changes the payouts for that city. Generally adding hotels makes the payouts for the 1st and 2nd player in the city better... up until a point. Once you start getting 2/3rds of the way around the track of a city, building more hotels starts decreasing the payouts.

Second, the number of hotels in a city changes who gets the payouts. Whoever has the most hotels get the 1st payout and 2nd most gets the second (lesser) payout. Ties are broken by who was first into the city. Some of the hotel spots you build on will trigger the oldest hotel getting demolished (which means it no longer counts towards majorities). Those demolished hotels go into the center of the city and can be rebuilt later for free (but at the end of the hotel chain, i.e. they count as a later hotel for breaking ties).

Each round, you get 6 hotels which get added to any you have leftover from previous rounds. The first person to place all their hotels triggers a scoring phase and then a new round. At the end of the third scoring round the game ends.

In the scoring phase each city pays the people with the first and second most number of hotels according to the amount shown on the next unbuilt hotel space. Any player with a factory gets the same amount as the player with the second most hotels... unless the city has the most (or is tied for the most) hotels, in which case the factory pays the same amount as the most hotels. There's also a bonus based on how many different cities you're in.

Loans are a bit wonky. You must fly how (for free) to take out a loan and you can only take 1 per turn. The loans cost either 10 or 16 and must be paid either after 1 round (for 12 or 20) or after 2 rounds (for 16 and 32). Then you have to buy a ticket to fly back out. So you'd ideally want to take all your loans at once so that you don't have to fly out again, but then you're sitting around doing nothing while others are building hotels and getting closer to ending the round. You can pay off loans at any time (but must pay them back after 2 rounds. Unpaid loans are negative points I think (nobody defaulted in our game).

The game is fairly simple but has emergent complexity. Fighting for majorities can be nasty as you end up triggering the spots that kick out early builds and/or the longer you fight the more you start devaluing the payouts. There's also a race to be the longest chain of hotels so that factories are more valuable... but that forces you to build more hotels (possibly causing a majority battle) and probably devaluing the payouts at that point.

There is some randomness in what plane tickets come out and you can sometimes get stuck wanting to go somewhere you can't easily reach. The more expensive tickets usually give you some flexibility, as they usually allow you to move 2 or 3 steps orthogonally, but even then moving from one corner to the opposite is 4 steps.

There's a lot to think about in the game. I enjoyed this play a lot.

Een puur economisch georiënteerd spel dat in eerste instantie nogal droog overkomt.

Spelers zijn ondernemers die in allerlei wereldsteden hotels en fabrieken bouwen. Fabrieken leveren constante inkomsten op, maar hotels zullen in verval raken als de stad te vol wordt gebouwd, bovendien worden nieuwe hotels ook minder waard, omdat de stad teveel hotels heeft.

Ook al komt dit spel erg droog over, het heeft lekker veel diepgang en is erg interessant. Vooral het feit dat je ook teveel kunt bouwen in een stad is een leuke vondst.

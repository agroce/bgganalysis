The best card art around. So many games for so many player counts, both themey and abstract, simple and complex. Unique suit systems bring new possibilities to classic card game mechanics. Some of the best games: Dueling Runes. Bharg. Chancellors.

Odds are it will go up...but since its still new I'll keep it at 8.  In general the games I've tried are all pretty light -- but surprisingly rich.  Jacynth, Quincux, Bharg, Emu Ranchers are all fine games.  And of course Magnate is the killer app.

And wait there's more! It seems to be a rich environment for designing games, I've got a couple in development and so we'll see where it goes.

I do NOT know of any good games for this thing.  I'd rather play Lost Cities with a Poker deck than Emu Ranchers.  I'm holding out for Dectana and Magnate though.  If neither of those games are any good, then I might dismiss this game system for good.

I kept reading about this curious thing called Decktet, but never had the time to investigate about it. Then, by chance, I put together a deck in one of the many Artscow sales. Downloaded a PDF with too many games and searched BGG for some suggestion about games to try... and I was amazed!
I tried Magnate, and it is a little clever gem! I suspect the Decktet is one of those clever, odd projects with such a great potentiality that I will toy myself with it for a while! Great job, mr. Magnus!!

It packs more information than a standard deck in a smaller number of cards. It has small symmetries all over it, but's ultimately asymmetrical, which makes it unique among systems. The artwork is lovely! And it's just cards, so it's easy to make. All those factors may have contributed to making it the most popular (intentional) system out there.

Despite having some very popular games, none of those really attracted me, and its arbitrary nature eventually turned me off.

The cards are gorgeous and very flavorful.  The illustrations are tarot like and each card has a name.  The idea of having cards with multiple suits seems rich with possibilities for invention.  So far I've played Varg Bid (which I rated a 9) and Quincunx (which I rated a 7).  I look forward to trying other games.   I would gladly pay $25 for this deck, but I don't have to since it's free.

Hard to rate a game *system*, but I've played multiple enjoyable games using the Decktet cards so have to call it a success.  In both concept and implementation, the Decktet offers far more value than many retail card games.  The biggest issue is filtering through the rules for available games to find the most appealing ones.

Highly recommended for people who enjoy card games.

Ambiguity

Ambiguity: The property wherein a thing has more than one interpretation.

Of all of Empson's seven types, and more. 

"What is that?" "What does it do?" "Where does it go?" "What is its value?" 

Those are the questions I want a game to ask.

But, I like ambiguity even at the meta-game level, where the game itself is in question.

Zendo might be a good example of this. Is there any sense in which you're "playing a game" of Zendo? I don't know. It's an activity, it has rules and a rigid structure, it has a "winner" [of each round]. 

But, the game isn't about winning [and it isn't even about the tired Knizia quote's "goal that is important, not the winning"]. The game is about not winning for as long as possible until something interesting happens.

The goal as a player of Zendo is to create an interesting game experience for all involved.

Do you make random assertions and see how they work out?

Do you make a rule as master that is devilishly clever yet easy to grasp once uncovered? 

Do you progress by making tiny modifications to things you already know, in hopes of deducing small elements of the big picture, or do you make koans that are as wildly different from all known information as possible?

Is the game about guessing rules or is it about how to guess rules? Is the game a game at all, or is it a simulation of scientific processes of induction? I don't know. I don't care. It's everything I want in a game.

But, there is one thing that is more ambiguous even than Zendo. If you've followed me the past year, you know what it is. 

The Decktet is the pinnacle of ambiguity in gaming, and perhaps my favorite gaming thing ever. 

Its creator describes it as "Perhaps, the kind of tarot deck they use in the alternate universe where Charlemagne was a badger."

That alone is sufficient to explain the ambiguity that is the Decktet, but allow me to digress. The Decktet doesn't exist in an alternate universe at all, of course; it exists in our own. Why would a deck from our universe declare itself to be from another?

The Decktet is ambiguous on all possible levels. Its identity is ambiguous [see above]. Its construction is ambiguous [is there an order, or isn't there?]. Its concept is inherently ambiguous [is this card's suit suns or moons?]. Its artwork is ambiguous. 

There is a card in the Decktet called "The Darkness". It is a completetly blank card. You see, you can't "see" the art in the dark. But, "no art" means a bright white card!

Nearly every card in the Decktet has two "orientations", both literally and figuratively. As you turn a card around, the right-side-up artwork changes from passive to active.

There is ambiguity of almost all other sorts in the art, as well. Is the lizard at the campfire by The Borderland's wall an outsider seeking entrance or an insider on a picnic of sorts?

Are the animals anthropomorphic, or are the people zoomorphic? Are the various "natural" animals [the tiger being fought in The Battle, the horse being ridden in The Journey] also "people"?

Is the Merchant buying goods from suppliers on The Market card, or is he selling goods to customers? There is not a single card in the Decktet with an airtight interpretation.

Then, there are the games. 

Ace Trump [among many others] allows you to break the cardinal rule of trick-taking: Follow suit, or trump? 

It answers "Well, do both."

My own game, Conundrum, breaks another rule, that of a hand or a trick "being in" a certain suit. In Conundrum, you don't know what suit a trick is or what suit is trump until the trick is over and someone wins it. 

In Bharg, you go out either by having everything "bound" in a set [which means basically that they share no characteristics: no suits in common within sets], or by having everything not bound [which means all the cards share a suit], or some combination.

And so it goes in all the Decktet games.

If you like the concept of "multi-choice cards" from Selwyth's board game taxonomy, the Decktet amplifies it exponentially.

It is one of few true gaming innovations.

Decktet is essentially a new type of card deck made up of 10 cards per 6 suits.  There are only 36 cards in the deck though, the 2-9 cards each belong to two suits.  You use this specialized card deck to play a variety of card games.

love this deck, love many of the games.  interesting, beautiful, quirky, fun.  I purchased the firmament decktet from gamecrafter-- very nice printed edition, looks great, feels great. There are so many games created for it by the online community.  Everything is free and supportive.  Many of the games are brilliant-- my favs are Adaman and Jacynth.  The deck is unique and complex in structure: the ranks are double suited, but the suit combos are also asymmetrically distributed.  This allows all sorts of interesting wrinkles in game mechanics--which is why so many intriguing games are possible.  Very highly recommended!

It seems very odd to rate a gaming system, which isn't a game in and of itself, but the Decktet is a lovely little collection of art (yes, I have bought decks of cards for nothing more than their looks), and also has  a number of interesting games built around it.

At this point, I have played Quincunx solitaire and Jacynth, and both were nice games, moved quickly and were interesting with a potential for added enjoyment as they are played more.

The multi-suited cards are fascinating, the deck is smaller in number, which keeps things focused and games shorter, and the art appeals to me.  So I will give the Decktet a 7 to begin with, with a strong potential to move up as I try new games, and learn these better.

Initial Rating: N/A

I acquired Decktet on 2012 and I realized I will never was going to play it so I sold it. The reason is that just this year (2017) I realized that I dislike game systems.

In general, I feel that Game Systems (like Mu and More, Spiel) have one good game and the other games are rather mediocre. When I see a game system I think immediately that the effort in creating all those games could be better spent in creating  ONE truly great game than in creating a myriad of bad games, due to this, I’m never going to play any other game system again. I also sold my copy of 504.

The Decktet is simply awesome.  A wonderful innovation for the card gaming community.  There's plethora of games to play with this thing and they're good!  Unlike the generic and boring Piecepack this thing has legs.  There are games here that are perfect for gamers and non gamers alike.  I essentially never need to buy another card game (though I did and probably will continue to do so.)

Currently want to try:
-Corundum Conundrum

I played Jacynth and Magnate so far. I have to play Jacynth with more players, but this one is a good game too.
In Magnate you build properties based on the resources you get after the suits you have on your cards. The game mechanic is reminiscent to Settlers a little bit in that you also roll the dice to get resources and you can exchange three resources for one. However, it seems that in Magnate the luck element can be better managed and mitigated than in Settlers. It is engaging how you try to work out which card to use for what: whether to trade resources or develop/complete properties.
The rules are simple to learn and teach.
I love the charming artwork and the whole concept that is behind the suits and what the suits represent, I find it fascinating and enchanting.
I hope to learn and explore more games from the Decktet system over the years.

Beautiful artwork, and a growing set of games and prototypes?  Sign me up!

This is the version I printed up myself recently, to test out my card-making skills.  I printed the cards on a color printer, cut the fronts and backs, and slipped them into penny sleeves with a 50 cent deck of playing cards from the dollar store.

So far, I have tried:
Magnate, Bharg, Quäsenbo, Window, Gongor Whist, Adaman, Head Solitaire, Turtle Soup.

I liked all except for Quäsenbo (too simple), and possibly Window (too "normal" solitaire for me).  Especially enjoy Adaman and Magnate.  Sister digs Turtle Soup, must try it again with 4+ players.

Update: Have also now tried Ivory Tower and Window (both not to my taste and afford little control when compared with Adaman), and the solo variants of Jacynth and Quincunx (both of which I enjoyed but would like better played with others).

I really love this system. The games being made for it are interesting and diverse. Many are reminiscent of traditional games but with a bit of added flair that can't be matched. Many of the games feel much more modern as well making this a good match for a gamer.

For the low cost of the deck there is really a lot of value here.

2 of PDMagnus's printed decks (one each of 'firmament' and 'badger' designs) -- I like the 'badger' design more because there's no 'right way up' but edge wear shows much more easily on it than on the 'firmament' design.

LIKES:

* Game system with lots of options for games you can play with this deck of cards.

DISLIKES:

* The type of card suit can be very hard to distinguish on the cards.  What's up with that?  Horrible mistake to make for a card game! (Character, Event, Location)
* Short version of the game we selected to try was not very exciting.  No doubt the full version would be better.

I love the Decktet.  There, I said it. I've been testing out the various games, and will probide some comments for each below.

- Magnate: See seperate game entry for rating + plays. Awesome game!

- [thing=39704]Emu Ranchers[/thing]: Great risk/reward game.  Similar to lost cities in that players build up sequences of cards and need to earn points.  
Players: 30+

- [thing=69638]Goblin Market[/thing]: Interesting and fast playing auctioning game.  I haven't really figured out the strategy yet. 
Plays: 3

- [thing=39290]Jacynth[/thing]: Played solo only so far.  Pretty cool tile laying and area control game.
Plays: 1

- [thing=88147]Adaman[/thing]: Solo game, somewhat solitaire in nature.  Fairly hard but quite interesting.
Plays: 3

- [thing=64520]Gongor Whist[/thing]: Another solot game.  Really interesting trick taking and bidding game against a dummy hand with a nice escalation in tension.

What's the big deal? A deck of cards with multiple suits? Meh, anyone could came up with that, it's obvious like the wheel.

I think you see where I'm heading with all that. Insanely simple, yet clever card-system with tremendous possibilities, which is already proven by the dozens of highly enjoyable games based on a simple deck of Decktet. Apart from the mechanics, the graphic design of the whole Decktet universe is astonishing. Sometimes I flip through the deck, just to admire the artwork.

[thread=1342228]Thursday [WIP][/thread]

[u]09/06/2013[/u]: The Decktet is not a game but a game system to use for many user-created games.  It is a deck of cards (36 in the standard deck plus 9 additional in the extended deck) where the 2 thru 9 ranked cards are actually double suited.  There are Aces and Crowns (the 10), and there are six suits altogether.

This is a fantastically versatile system for gaming.  The dual suited cards add so many interesting decisions and mechanisms to gameplay and allows for many styles of games - trick-taking, tableau-building, area control, etc.

Thus far, I've only touched the tip of the iceberg by playing three of the games (mostly solitaire): [thing=37097][/thing], [thing=88147][/thing] (1P only), and [thing=39290][/thing].  All three are excellent examples of what the Decktet can do.  I look forward to exploring more of the games available and digging deeper into this unique world.

RATING: 7
This is a "game system"; like a poker deck for it's ability to play many games, not just itself.  Interesting in that each card belongs to two suits.  Suits seem to have asymmetrical but balanced qualities.  Games I've played thus far are enjoyable.

Rating for the system, which is a masterwork.

Having to place your current workers upstream from your previous workers is [i]not[/i] an innovation.

Having to deal with a deck of cards that has simultaneously 150% of the suits and 75% of the cards of a standard deck [i]is[/i].

This is akin to the development of polyhedral dice from the d6, or of the hex-map from a standard square checkerboard.

Decktet is the most innovative and compelling thing to come along in gaming in the past decade.

My rating is for the entire system and less so for a specific game, since there are many games that can be played with the Decktet.

I'm especially fond of the graphic design and the interface of the cards.  There is so much variety and "possibility" in them that it's a wonderful tool for clever game designers.  Even though I've only played a handful of games so far, I've enjoyed each one immensely.

Supplementary, the Decktet book is a great addition of games to learn.  And so is a set of suited chips.  Or appropriately colored cubes, if one prefers.

I love the idea of the Decktet, I really do. The problem for me is that by reducing the number of cards, you reduce the game clock in almost all games you play with it. Consequently, you end up playing much faster hands where you don't make very many "which suit should this card be?" decisions, which I would think is the whole point of having multi-suited cards to begin with. Every game feels rushed as a result, and I don't think it's an accident that most (all?) of the well-received games either use extra components or else use two decks. The basic single deck simply doesn't have enough meat on it. 

I enjoyed the solo game Adaman the most.

More than a curiosity, this is an engine behind some fun, compelling gaming. & it sure sets the design gears moving. A pleasure to have sitting out on the table for the solitaire play & a thinking tool for game ideas.

This is an interesting version of a standard deck of playing cards. I like some of the games that can be played on it, but nothing really stands out as something I'd suggest at a game night.

It's been fun exploring the implications of this game system. I only really use the decktet to play Magnate these days, but for that game alone it deserves a 9.

♪ Don't go making mountains of dice for this; only a couple of games use even one of them ♫. I have the Game Crafter Firmament back (2010) and download version of the book (which, btw, has fewer games in it, than are now available for free & is B&W).

[i]Need a better solution for the suit chips.. wood cubes lack personality and the commercial set is too pricey. Maybe it's possible to buy, *just* the stickers?[/i] Perhaps *you* have a set of the stickers, or tokens even? [i]Hmm, (taps claws).[/i] Yep, gotta find a good Arch punch somewhere.

Decktet is a unique deck of cards, where there are six suits, and cards belong to two suits at the same time. This allows all kinds of new and fascinating card games that can be developed. The artwork is simply fantastic, the cards are a joy to look at and play with.

I've had my Decktet deck for quite some time, and had never played anything with it. Recently, I used it to try the game [thing=41090][/thing] and really enjoyed it. If you've been thinking of trying the decktet system, this is definitely one of the first games you should try.

I highly recommending ordering the [url=http://www.decktet.com/book.php]printed Decktet book[/url] which lists the history of the deck, as well as rules for a bunch of games you can play with it.

It is hard to rate a game system with the usual rating scheme. But the versatility of these cards is so great and there are so many interesting and good games around, I can only give this system the highest rating.

Hard to rate a whole card system, but I love the artwork and the general idea of the multiply suited cards. I've only played a few solitaire games so far, but the difference between Decktet and standard cards is a stimulating change.

Not something I'm going to go to all the time, but the games for the Decktet are innovative and enjoyable. The ability to design more games for the cards is great.

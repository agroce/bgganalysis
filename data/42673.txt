Unpunched - 22 Jan 2016 - Traded to Aaron Bedard(RawDealDemo) for Combat + a magazine game. A trade down, but I've never been into Napoleonics (beyond the Sharpe novels & TV movies), so the interest was higher for a more tactical WWII game.

It seems like a vintage Dan Versen game: solitaire and lots of chit cups, high production values, good rulebook and kind of "meh" in the end.

I would rather a play a Field Commander game than a Leader game because blowing up stuff and getting blown up is more thrilling than dealing with pilot fatigue.

If you like the [thing=28829][/thing] and [thing=35350][/thing], you will like this.  The same resource challenges are here: from battle plans to supply points.  The insights are a great touch.  The combat system is the best of the games, although the sweeping cavalry charges are just too overpowered.  This one also has a LOT of scenarios, if you just can't get enough Napoleon in your life.

Why not a higher rating?  I don't know.  I'm just slightly above "meh" for it.  Why is it my lowest rated leader game?  Because I don't care for Napoleonic games.

The best Field Commander Game I think. Very well done, with some great ideas. The tactical battles quickly become "gamey" feeling though. The absolute best candidate for my "perfect light-medium tactical Napoleonic wargame."

RATING: 9
Really an incredible design. The randomness of the dice certainly play a factor, but I feel this is mitigated enough by careful strategy to avoid the luck being too swingy.

Record of Victories:

1796: Superior
1798: Superior (10 Forces remaining, did not defeat Acre)
1800: Superior
1805: Historical
1806: Historical

It's not an mage knight, but then again, nothing is. It is simply set up, extremely strategic, and every second of it is compelling. One of the perfect solo games there is. The one comment i have is that the setup of each campaign is always the same. But there are 11 different campaigns and each of them are just so different.

Initial Impression: Very nice production quality, with mounted maps and thick unit counters. The map artwork feels periodic as well. The AI was a bit more procedural than I typically prefer in my solitaire games. Overall, the game felt like a puzzle and I suspect that once solved, each battle may not have much replay value.

Yes it's beautiful, yes it covers all of Napoleon's campaigns, but i just doesn't hold my interest. Big stacks of counters that look like they would work really well on a tactical miniatures battles format but...game play for me was only adequate and rules organization left a LOT to be desired. There is a lot of flicking back and forward in the rule book and critical rules are not highlighted. On the up side a lot of examples of play help.

Might give it another couple of plays and if it impresses more will lift rating

This might be my favorite of the Field Commander games so far, of those I have played. I enjoy the battle mechanic in this game. There is really a sense of the unknown as the Battle Plans for the enemy side can either not help them at all or completely assist in destroying you. I am currently playing through the campaign mode, finished the 1796 and 1798 campaigns. A must have for any solitaire gamer.

RATING: 7.5
Based on 6 scenario plays.  

After I got my expectations correctly aligned to the light wargame level presented in the strategic/battle systems, the game grew on me quickly.  A light, moderately abstract "Napoleonic chess" or almost Euro-like (in a good way) Napoleonic Lite wargame.  I find it has a similar light feel/ambience to the Napoleonics 20 battles series, which delivers good color/bang for the time/complexity buck.  Here, I particularly like the concepts of supply points/scout sub-systems, which are a clever catch-all abstraction of historical "living off the land" and "making war pay for war" / forced donations from conquered areas, and intelligence/reconnaissance activities.  House rules for some battle board aspects, and particular scenario years, will up the historicity/enjoyment at minimal cost.      

If played in limited doses at a time (2-3 campaign years here and there over 2 weeks), I think there is enough color and strategic variety to keep me engaged.  If I were to play more extended/concentrated doses, I think the sameness of too many one size fits all abstract battles one after the next would diminish the enjoyment.

This game is another winner in the Field Commander series.  The battle element is more detailed this time and the decision making is on a par with the earlier games.  I really like how the enemy can move around and even appear to do dumb things.  The lack of enemy movement I always felt was the biggest drawback to Alexander.   The many campaigns and quick learning curve make this an an enjoyable solitaire game.

Iterates on the systems first formed in Rommel and Alexander to produce, easily, the best of the series so far.

The components are quite nice. The AI seems quite random and it is strange that manoeuvre seems to have little direct impact on the resolution of battles. From my reading of Napoleonic history, much of Napoleon's success came from manoeuvre prior to the battle - this aspect seems totally absent from the game and the decision making for the Coalition player really is totally random.

Wow - What an excellent game.
It took me quite a while to walk through my first play though. The rulebook is not intuitive, although most of the rules are there somewhere, and a few rules queries and searches were required on BGG. But just playing that first scenario, albeit poorly (an ignominious defeat) - it was a wonderful rollercoaster ride! There're years of gaming for me in this box.

This is a massive production from DVG games which provides you with 11 scenarios. Each of the scenarios present you with a wide variety of different challenges you will have to face in order to succeed. While some scenarios suggest a main path you must take in order to have a chance to win, most seem to offer multiple options to consider. Some strategies you have to use to win can feel a bit "gamey," such as putting a single weak unit into an area as a lure to split the enemy's A.I. forces. Luck plays a heavy role (or "roll" if you like puns) in this game and seems necessary to win some of the tougher scenarios. I love the way combat is implemented -- you fight on a separate "battle board" instead of rolling on a CRT (Combat Results Table). Scenarios take about 2 hours to play, give or take. Replay value is high, because discovering the best path to take in a scenario won't guarantee victory due to the wide variance in A.I. movement/battle results.

Not a game that I plan to play continuously once I've finished my play of all 11 scenarios (I'm currently at 7), but I would like to put this back on the table after some time on the shelf.

RATING: 8.5
After playing through 3 campaigns I can say that the game has variety with each campaign having unique objectives and demanding different approaches to victory. I was initially worried that this game would be repetitious but I didn't get that feeling in the least. The rules are a little wordy and could have probably used a re-writing, but overall it's not complex. The game is not difficult to learn. It's great fun.

TIP: 
If you have a game of Risk, you can use the army pieces from Risk to represent your forces on the campaign map, rather than have large stacks of counters cluttering up the map. For example: I place one figure (let's say a blue cavalry figure) on the map to represent the forces in one territory, then take all those forces counters there and unstack them and lay them out in a "list" layout on my table top and place a matching blue cavalry piece beside it so that it is now represented on the map board. I can now quickly see all the combat values of the forces and quickly calculate totals for envelopment checks. It also makes the campaign map look much cooler with thematic minis.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
After five plays of the first campaign (and my first victory) I can easily say that this is my favourite solo war game (of the three I have tried). There is a fine balance of skill and luck and the tactical battles can be really epic sometimes. The component quality is top notch - if you are looking for a solo war game this is definitely one to consider (and this is coming from a guy with zero interest towards Napoleon).

I just don't get it.  Either I don't get how to play correctly, or, if I am playing correctly, then I don't get why this game is fun.

In my 3 or so games so far, the AI has been punishingly difficult and gameplay swingy.  Crappy die rolls (e.g. not activating your insight or battle plans, withdrawal table, etc.) are extremely painful.  Adding that to the misleadingly linear maps (i.e. maps that look interesting but turn out to have only one obviously solution) means you can lose a whole campaign in a few unlucky die rolls and there is little you can do to mitigate it.

Maybe it's me, but I expect a Napoleonic game to have more skill and strategy involved.

But I'm not ready to give up.

My first game of Field Commander:  Napoleon ended in a 'historic' victory.  I'm as good as Napoleon—hooray!!  (No, not really, of course—but it's fun to pretend.)

While I did not find the rulebook to be particularly well-written, the game itself isn't difficult to learn.  Most of the trip-ups I had were in figuring out how the shock and melee rules fit in to the overall combat rules, and their special sets of sub-rules (e.g., units in column auto-fail their shock tests).

FC:N is fun.  I love the grand strategic map.  If I'm being honest, the tactical battles felt a tad tedious much of the time.  Especially having to randomly draw orders for the enemy each turn only to find that in most instances they either just moved the unit forward, or actually worked against the AI by keeping its unit in place (e.g., drawing "Aimed" on a unit in the approach while the rest of the line advanced).  I found myself having the most success with sitting back and letting the enemy come to me, whilst I bombarded him with cannon-fire.  (Not exactly what Napoleon did in Italy, but hey—it saved me from taking unnecessary losses.)  I'll be curious to see if the tactical battles experience improves a bit in some of the later campaigns.

For the 1796 Italian misadventure, I found it best to simply divide my forces into two lots to try and draw the allies into two different directions.  It worked pretty well, often giving the AI two equidistant targets for its orders, allowing me to choose which stacks went where.  While I did have to do a tactical retreat out of Milan at one point, I took it back the following turn.

In the end, I must admit that I was helped a great deal by the randomness of the enemy AI.  Had the large pile of Austrians and Sardinian-Piedmontese simply stayed in Klagenfurt, I'd have had a helluva time trying to get them out.  In the end, they split their forces, allowing me to accomplish a very Napoleonic feat—isolating and destroying my foe.

All in all FC:N was good, clean fun.  Enough so that I'm already fixing to plan my next campaign.  What's that you say about not starting a land war in Asia?  Poppycock!

A big and heavy box  to accommodate mounted maps and lots of fine cut counters, all quality made with nice graphics and art. The rules book is fine although it could need a revision just to handle the back and forth of looking for that particular exception or result for a specific action. Otherwise it works fine as a solitaire wargame. The strategic and tactical aspect might look abstract or even that deviates from reality but results are surprisingly historical. You get tough decisions and dilemmas since you will never have enough troops, supplies or battle plans to cope with everything. Even though one knows how the enemy is going to act or can forsee things to come, there are always surprises and unpleasant situations to handle. The game has achieved its goal by putting you in the boots of this great commander. On top of these, it is probably the only boardgame that handles ALL of Napoleons’ campaigns in one bundle.

May well be the absolute best solitaire wargame I have played, ranging from a delightfully deep tactical/combat level (I love how it "zooms in" for battles, which involve significant tactical options and choices with multiple interacting factors to consider) up toward more operational/strategic levels outside of that.  And the campaign structure is wonderful, with each scenario offering different challenges.  On top of that, the AI system is quite elegant and excellent.

Truly a masterpiece in terms of this type of game.

Okay, I've played through the entire monstrous campaign.

The components are all top-notch - thick, easy-to-read, beautiful counters, attractive mounted mapboards with the set-up info and charts handily located right on the boards, a nice battle-mat display (unmounted if you didn't pre-order, which I did not, but printed on thick, glossy stock and plenty functional).  The rules are in full color with plenty of examples of play and illustrations.  Dan really went all out on the components, and they are excellent.

Now for the nitty-gritty... how does it play?  Veterans of previous FC titles will recognize the fundamental elements of the FC system, but there are a myriad of improvements and customizations to it for Napoleonics.  It is as different from the previous two FC games as they are from each other, but still distinctly part of the FC series.  There is a little more meat to combat now, as combat is played out on the battle-mat, and troops must move tactically during battle as well as fight.  All three arms are represented appropriately (inf, cav, arty).  The battles are the heart of the game, and work very well for the most part.  My one niggle here is that Nappy's enemies use random battle-order draws, and therefore their battle orders are often incompetent.  The game is balanced around the expectation that the enemy tactics in battle will be less than brilliant however, so in the grand scheme of things it doesn't present a problem.  Just feels a bit awkward sometimes when an enemy column goes into line formation when they are in their own reserve zone, far from the front line of the battle.

All of Nappy's major campaigns are included - 11 in total - played out over 7 mapboards (some boards host 2 campaigns).  EVERY campaign is unique and presents the player with different challenges.  Every campaign has it's own special rules that give the campaign flavor.  And every campaign is well-designed and well-balanced, such that none of them are easy to win but all are possible to win.  There are multiple approaches to victory in most of them.  IMO, this is an amazing achievement by Dan.  It's rare that you find a multi-scenario game where even half of the scenarios are well-balanced and unique.  In this game, all of them are.  EVERY.  SINGLE.  ONE.  This game was obviously a labor of love, and I believe the time and care put into it really show through, and paid off in the form of a great game.  

Alas, I would be remiss if I didn't point out that there are some typos and repeated words in the rules, mostly isolated to a couple of small rules sections that unfortunately didn't get proof-read well enough.  It is generally not to difficult to figure out these rules sections even with the typos, but it was a bit annoying and made it a little more difficult to learn the system.  Overall, I think this is a minor quibble, as once we got going we had no trouble with the rules.

In conclusion, this game looks absolutely stunning, but when you dig deeper you find it plays as good as it looks.  It is full of new ideas for the system, and almost all of them work very well.  Many publishers would have split this into 3 games, to milk the system for more profit.  I appreciate that Dan didn't do this, but rather offered it all in one comprehensive (and monstrous) package.  It is expensive, yes, but after playing it I consider it one of the best values on my gaming shelf, and possibly my most treasured single game.

Best solitaire game I have ever owned. Play is engaging and intense. AI is challenging and gameplay is seemless and well designed so that AI moves do not bog the player down or require tedious recordkeeping. Components are incredible and the package is complete and comprehensive of all of Napolean's major campaigns - 11 of them on 7 mounted boards - very impressive! No need for expansions! I highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys wargaming, and especially for anyone who has any level of interest in this time-period.

I was conflicted about getting Field Commander Napoleon because I feel in love with Napoleon the Waterloo Campaign and never really felt like I needed another Napoleon game when I have never played a Napoleon game as fun as the Waterloo Campaign. But I love the Field Commander series so I got this one as well. This game is the best solitaire game I have ever played. The combat is less abstract than say but it doesn't bog you down in tactics either. The AI is better than Alexander as well. Love this game it's a 10 in my book with plenty of replay value.

Bought back in August 2011. Has sat on the shelf virtually all that time. Recently finally punched the counters and such and thought it was time to give it some table time. My copy seems to have some issues with glue/mould stains on the inside box. Threw out the box insert as this seemed to be the infected part! Fortunately the game maps and counters appear fine. Still have yet to get the game played!

Update
13/10/2012
Have just started reading the rules... Over a year after first purchase....crazy! Rules book seems ok and I hope to get this played in the very near future.

Well it has taken a long time but, I have finally had a chance and the determination to get this game started. Re-read the rules last week and have started my first campaign today with the first play of Italy 1796. Bit clunky at the mo due to the rules department and familiarity oh and the not inconsequential problem of a cat also wanting to play! Going well so far and I can see the merits in the game system...and it certainly is appealing.

Just played the Waterloo Campaign. A seemingly very simple scenario that still has some nice nuances. Flubbed the reinforcement issue by putting the dead back into the cup as normal and therefore drawing 'odd' units and finding them in weird places on the map. Didn't really effect the game play. Didn't do too well as I only managed 14 Vps on my first attempt so failed to achieve what I needed to do even though I actually took out the Austrians and most of the allied powers too just didn't get them all in large enough battles therefore Vps were low! Will try again later this evening. Discovered that sweep is sweet if the rolls work well!

Waterloo Day and a good excuse to get another game of the 100 days scenario in. Excellent game, very close and tense. Played right down to the wire and even though the Prussian's and Anglo-allied were totally wiped out I still only managed and inferior victory result....hmmm not sure The Napster would have seen it the same way at all!

What a great game!  Out Napoleoned Napoleon in 1796 only to have my ass kicked by the Ottomans in 1798.  1813 is a real pleasure which really recreates a historic situation well whilst giving an exciting experience.

There is quite a clever solitaire system employed in this  game. While not very realistic in some ways, it does seem to accomplish the goal of getting Napoleon to rapidly engage, and hopefully envelope, enemy forces, to destroy them quickly and force march to gain control of objective areas.  The enemy bot seems to respond quite convincingly most of the time, although it may divide its forces unrealistically in front of Napoleon suddenly. Somehow though, the whole thing seems to work quite well. My one criticism would be that the rules could be clearer in several places.

RATING: 7
This is the best solo wargame I've played to date.  I enjoyed it more than Ambush, which I found extremely clunky (constantly having to recheck hexes, many new rules coming into play with every single action), Raid on St. Nazaire (requires a more lengthy setup and can end quickly if the initial approach goes poorly), and B-17 (extremely luck based and little to no strategy).  The battle system is clean and interesting.  The randomness of enemy movement can greatly influence the game with some rolls making the objectives quite easy to take.  Despite my positive feelings about it I just could never get into it, nor play more than two scenarios.  I am not a solo gamer and likely never will be.

RATING: 8
A few points I have to make after 6 plays:

1. Amazing component quality.
2. Great gameplay with really varied scenarios (I mean it, they are REALLY different from each other - defend Paris, take hold of objectives scattered throughout the whole map, run through Egypt, survive the attack on a small part of map etc), fun battles and just enough challenge to keep you coming back to already played scenarios. Some are maybe a bit too challenging, but that's ok for me.
3. This game is so much better than FC: Alexander, which was fun for 1-2 plays of each capaign, and then it wasn't.
4. This game is NOT only for dedicated wargamers, despite what some comments may indicate - don't get discouraged, it's still light wargame compared to those more "serious" ones like RAF or D-Day at Omaha Beach, not to mention Fields of Fire. Maybe rules have some mistakes, maybe they could be better written, but overall the game is easy to learn and easy to set up and play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
Early thoughts: Obviously a step up from Alexander in weight due to the more detailed battle system and units that can move around the board. This does however seem to open itself up to some fairly unrealistic choices on the part of the AI; single units choosing to march into a region filled to the brim with Frenchies. Cavalry units deciding to sit back in the reserve at the beginning of battles, or random Battle Plans issued to units that don't seem very clever choices on the part of the commander (the last of which does admittedly happen in Alexander, although to a lesser extent).

There are some unfortunate typos in the rulebook (First Edition) that had me re-reading a couple of sentences in order to grasp the meaning. 

But, as I said, these are definitely early thoughts. I still haven't finished the first campaign. I suspect once I get more in the groove of the game after a few more campaigns, my opinion of it will rise to that of Alexander.

RATING: 7
Fast and fun game. Tons of difficult decisions. The battles tend to be bloody and quick. 

The only aspect I don't like is having to count up an armies combat value to check for routs. In larger battles this really slows down the game.

The production quality is amazing on this game and that makes me feel even worse about the fact I've started to loose interest. The game has encouraged me to learn more about napoleons life (especially the Egyptian campaign) but in general the scope is so large it doesn't carry much emotion. I miss the sense of loss I get in Hornet leader when one of my pilots is shot down! Games of this scale should be more epic and exciting but I guess I just prefer stories/games told on a more intimate scale.

Update- lowered my score because I just don't play this as much any more. Too many great DVG games!

*March 2013* Took the plunge. Expensive game. Beautiful components. I think I'll sell every other solitaire game I own and switch between this and Thunderbolt: Apache Leader for my solitaire gaming..... until D-Day at Omaha Beach is released!

*April 2013* 1 play. Holy crap, it was amazing. I won the 1796 campaign with a superior victory! It felt like a 2 player game, or at least as good as a videogame AI. This is my go-to solitaire at the moment... TAL is awesome as well but this one plays quicker, is less fiddly, and has less bookkeeping. I also thoroughly enjoyed every second of it, it was fun! Next stop, Egypt 1798!

I love Field Commander: Napoleon and can’t say enough about it. It works for me on every level and does this old war gamer’s heart a lot of good. The strategic scope is there. You can play each campaign as a manageable chunk of the whole of Napoleon’s career. The production is absolutely top class, the mechanics and AI are superb. It is all great and interesting fun. How Dan Verssen will top it, is the next great question. If you have any interest in Napoleonic war games, you must buy it!

Probably the pinnacle of the Field Commander system so far (2015). It is random, so it will not be to everyone's liking. However, it generates a compelling narrative and each of the campaigns feel different but equally interesting.

So much to like about this game. Beautifully produced - it is a joy to play on the board and set up the pieces. Easy rules - I almost never have to check them. No need to dig up tables and charts. It's close to playing chess, where your attention is completely on the board. Every game is tense and victories often come down to a single roll of the dice after a hard fight. Favorite solitaire game at the moment.

Comment: Great solo game and easily the best one I own. I will be playing the maps multiple times to try to beat my scores and the maps really are replayable enough to warrant at least 2 plays through. Components are top notch. Only complaint about this game is that it's a bit fiddly and the rules are slightly ambiguous in a few spots. I don't mind the length of the game, but it can get a bit long near the end.

Acquired the game.  It must be me, due to not being much of a wargamer, but the rules seem more challenging to grasp than in the simplistic way they're laid out in the rulebook.  There's a lot to remember when doing a battle, and after looking at the BGG forums, I think there's a fair amount of ambiguity when rules questions are discussed.  Again, maybe it's me.

It's a wonderful product, though.  I'm in no position to give it a rating, but I'm looking forward to fully playing through a scenario.  

I truly wish my copy had a mounted battle board.  It's a shame that it's cardboard-thin.

The deeper I dive into the endless pool that is wargames, the more I realized that games like this one simply do not come along very often at all.


This was in the package of the first three games that I purchased online in 2012, after reopening my eyes to the hobby and finding this website, and the entire universe within.

Of those three, this was the first that I opened, punched, taught myself, and for weeks following, could not get off my mind. All of my days felt distracted, anxiously driven to getting back to hovering over my table and playing this

Sadly, it's production quality set a high-water mark that I am now realizing few other games will reach or even strive for.

The game itself provides plenty of fun and tension. The scenarios are tight and very manageable. Your faced with some strategies choices and then you fight it out with the enemy on a separate Battle-map

It all flows smoothly and the rule-book is laid out in a way where finding yr answers takes no time at all.

HUGE re-play value, with 11 scenarios to fight through and some of them very difficult to win. If you're feeling particularly ambitious there are rules for linking them all together in one, career-spanning, campaign.

As I dive deeper into this hobby, learning and playing a variety of different games, this one has been creeping lower and lower down my, must-play list. There are just many great and challenging titles in my life suddenly,

But it will forever hold a special place for me, as my very first.

Very playable solo system, excellent components. Still getting into it, and not yet sure whether the need to find the optimal strategy for each scenario in order to win (move which direction with what number of armies each turn, etc.) will ultimately prove to be a virtue or a bore.

Enjoyed my first few plays but then found the battles tedious and repetitive. A shame because the strategic map was interesting and I enjoyed the decision making that arose there.

Got this game in the mail today. Instead of doing graduate school reading I punched out the pieces and dove into it. I got about three plays of the 1796 Scenario in before I had to call it quits. I got my butt beat the first two games. I was kind of surprosed by that to be honest. Some of it was a loose understanding of the rules that got better the more I tinkered with, but the board beat me fair and square. 
 I thought the pieces to the game were very well done and you get a ton of content and game potential for this game. I logged in about five hours and I have yet to even scratch the surface of the depth of this game. I am really impressed with this as a solitaire game and recommend it to anyone looking for a good game to play solo. Awesome awesome game so far.

An interesting game. It adheres to none of the tried-and-true mechanics of the period, neither operationally nor tactically.  It still manages to capture some of the feel, especially because to win one must generally act bold and take chances with Napoleon's various advantages.  The AI is kinda dumb (they usually are) and it splits its forces too often, but it can also put together surprising moves.  I had to make emergency recruitment to reinforce the garrisons of Nice and Genoa and they nearly fell to rearguard forces roving the area.  If I had dawdled at the end, the Austrians were moving on Milan and may have taken it.

The battles are fun to play out.  The battlefield is abstracted primarily by range, and you get a limited number of special commands.  Most units can activate using basic plans (move or shoot) but they often have to make a roll to do it.  The use of formations primarily to make activations automatic for certain orders is an interesting twist.  Again, the AI isn't that smart, but it can put together a credible assault given enough forces.  I never had to face a tough army in this campaign, so I was never threatened on the battlefield except for the aforementioned sieges against my communications.

All in all, I would try it again.  The main AI stupidity is due to forcing groups to activate in small numbers, but this varies by campaign (among other factors) so I think there is more replayability to be had than at first glance.  It was fun, but didn't do much for the grognard in me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Early rating and is subject to change.  There doesn't seem to be a ton of game here, though.

UPDATE:

I played through a few of the campaigns and came away with a decidedly better feeling about the game.  Yes, the AI is quite random, but the scenario construction is tailored enough to make each campaign have a distinct feel.  The rulebook isn't set up to easily learn the game, but works well enough as a reference once you have a hang of things.  Playtime is very manageable, and it's nice to have such a small footprint.  Doesn't capture any real operational feel, but you can certainly make Napoleon's theory of the central position work for you, swatting one force after another.  

I don't love designed solitaire games, but this is one of the better ones I've played.

Uses the [b]Field Commander[/b] system, but with more elegance and significantly more importance placed on tactics chits than [b]Field Commander: Alexander[/b].

If there are multiple enemy units eligible for tactics (i.e. they have the same quality rating), you may choose which of those units receive which Tactics chits. I've tried playing with the enemy Tactics chits being allocated most advantageously for the enemy and, needless to say, Napoleon was defeated quite quickly.

Manoeuvring around the campaign map involves a considerable amount of gambling on whether enemy units will move or not. You can easily get superior victories by liberal use of force marching, but it can often be risky.

Lots of scenarios packed into this game. It's excellent. It only suffers a bit to be because I'm more of a fan of pre-gunpowder era wargaming.

First solo game I've ever played and I'm fairly impressed. A solid offering for those who love Napoleonic campaigns or solo games in general.

So far I have enjoyed the experience but it hasn't totally grabbed me.  This rating may go up or down depending how the next few games go.  [b]The components however are magnificent, even better than Lost Battles![/b]

Update:  Played a scenario last night and I finished at 3am. I really enjoyed it, maybe there is more to this than was initially apparent to me.  I think once you appreciate the type of experience this game offers and don't expect more outside its intended scope then it can be very enjoyable.  The rating climbs and I will update this when I pull it off the shelf again.

[b]Kudos to DVG for their fantastic customer service [/b]

Whilst not a traditional wargame as a solitaire experience its faultless. Pretty hefty price tag for a hefty amount of game and replayability. Components are outstanding too.

As at Nov 2015, I've not been able to invest the time required to get the rules down properly. I set up the initial campaign, ploughed through the rulebook, kind of bounced off it, left it set up a few days and then ended up boxing it back up. So, game 1, me 0. I'm probably too stupid (or time starved) to play. Not defeated yet, but need to be in right mood with plenty of time to fire this up again.

Better than FC: Alexander in terms of bot scripting and player options. Still quite basic. But enjoyable for a while.

Unlike the elegantly explained and terrific solitaire gem that is Thunderbolt Apache Leader, the rulebook of Field Commander: Napoleon is loaded with typos and lacking a LOT of important information, even though both are from the same talented (and prolific) designer, Dan Verssen.  After I did a number of online reconnaissance missions to fill in the clerical blanks, I determined that FC:N was indeed a pretty good game.

I very much like the two differently scaled maps (though I did not love that the combat map looked like a football field).  The way the campaigns have both a macro (geographic map) and micro (battle map) focus is really nice.  Although interesting conceptually, the Battle Plan assignment phase seems to complicate and slow down things more than I’d like, especially with all of the unclear abbreviations and forced non-assignments that may occur.

I played Field Commander: Napoleon in full three times, and I had an ‘Inferior Victory’ the third time, but the lack of fluidity with the combat sections (even after many hours of play) and the quantity of modifiers that are scattered throughout the rule book, but listed nowhere else made it too clunky and procedural to flow.

So it’s a pretty good game that underperforms when compared to complete DVG successes like Thunderbolt Apache Leader (which gets my highest recommendation as both a war game and a solitaire game) and Warfighter WWII, which I am currently playing for a fourth time and relishing.

Really enjoying this so far. The battles aren't super accurate, but they capture the feel and provide an interesting and varied challenge.

I'm playing through the campaigns while reading Chandler's [i]The Campaigns of Napoleon[/i]. I've played both the 1796 Italian Campaign and 1798 Egyptian Adventure so far. Initial rating of 7.

Owned this game and sold it on. First let me say it is beautifully produced. Quality components in every area. And after reading the rules I was very keen to get going too. The first board of the campaign was enjoyable enough, but by the time I got to the second board, the procedure was already wearing thin. For me, it was something a bit to repetitive and in the end I just grew bored, only making my way through about half the boards. Of course, it is great for dyed-in-the-wool solo gamers so inclined, but being just as ardent an ftf gamer, it simply didn't hold my attention with wash, rinse repeat feel of it all.

Like New.  Rules have some creases from folding in middle.  Counters are unpunched and the Battle Board is not mounted.  The inside box top right corner is split, it came that way when I received it.

Александр был местами хорош, но не всем. Например баталии отыгрываемые бросками кубика за кубиком мне не интересны. Боевые планы - великолепнейшая идея, но из-за общей абстрактности боя уже не так впечатляет.

-- Апдейт

Все еще в сомнениях. В теории игра стала заметно интересней Александра (ИИ стал активней, и баталии также импрувнулись), но по рулбуку не сложилось нормальное мнение.

[COLOR=#FFFFFF][BGCOLOR=#000000]1P[/BGCOLOR][/COLOR] Great game if you are looking for a light wargame that's not bogged down with rules. Covers all eleven of Napoleons campaigns. Smooth gameplay, decent rulebook, excellent components (7 Mounted boards and a ton of thick counters!).

You have to like Napoleonics.  You have to like solo play.  Lots of excellent maps and counters in the box to follow all the major historical battles of Napoleon.  Either solo them individually or link them into a campaign.  Good stuff.

Easily the best of the Field Commander series due to the number of scenarios and more decisions.  The special rules make the scenarios more interesting.  Combat is more like an actual battle than the other 2 games.  The difficulty of the scenarios has a bigger range.  That being said, this is still a pretty light game and much of the strategy is how much to push your luck than any big tactical/strategic decisions.

The idea is excellent.  But, the A.I. of the enemy is somewhat weak.

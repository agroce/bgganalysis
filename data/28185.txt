This is NOT a serious and complex game, so if you're looking for that go elsewhere!  However, it is a ton of fun and the theme works surprisingly well with an essentially card-driven and die rolling game.The cards are really attractive if a little thin.  The rules are best played with the simple version first and then by adding the extra rules bit by bit.  Works well with various numbers of players.  It's a great theme and I like the game.

Not many wargames let you play both sides all at the same time. TKP does it at its most simplistic manner.

The rules, I agree, was not very well represented. It took me plenty of reads before I got the gist of the game AFTER a few solo tries. Lots of the explanations were left on the cards and more so on the player aid sheet-booklet!

This is one of those games that needs more plays in order to get the hang of the card interactions.

Overall, a light and simple card game that is made complex by the rules.

Fun game that fails as a simulation of its subject.
The artwork on the cards perfectly evokes the 19th century, condemning this game as completely out-of-place/time.

RATING: 6
Fast & Fun. What keeps me from a higher rating is the eurogame feeling, which you get from playing German warships, British warships and the merchant vessels all at once. Makes it more abstract. The solitaire rules involving a phantom player are very well done and sometimes it really gets personal with that guy :-)

UPDATE: Downgraded from 7 to 6,  because of the heavy eurogame feeling which does not fit the theme. Still a lot of fun and i am always in for a game.

Eh, I only tried it solo, but I'm not sure how the game will get better trying with more players.  It's just seems like it'll be too slow.  Draw a card, do something.  Or spend turns doing nothing but drawing a single card a turn.  Weeee.

Of course, I'll try it again, want to give the game a fair shot.

RATING: 9
My group really enjoys this game.   The first learning hand or two are slow, but then it becomes fast and fun.  The  cards and actions  create a clear mental picture of what is meant to be happening on the seas -- the game tells a story of the War as you play.  The solo engine works well, but it emulates a 2-player game, and I prefer a 3-4 player game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.1
Rating based on 2 games so far. Not as interactive as say 'Atlantic Storm' or 'Pacific Typhoon'. Some down time evident and only drawing one card to replenish hand after turn is frustrating.

The overall package would benefit from a historical study or guide in the box to add colour. Cards remind me of the old Players cigarette card style of illustration ( that's a good thing and adds period flavour)

Have yet to try a team game and this may enhance the interaction.

At least you can hunt down and sink the Emden...

First play (with 2 players) left me feeling less than satisfied.  Haven't given up on it yet but it seemed a lil dull to me.  Very few card combos.  No real choice of strategies.  Fairly obvious decisions.  Lasted too long.

I'd be happy to give it another chance or two to see if I missed something tho.

I've played this twice now in 4-plr mode. Overall a good game, but it goes for too long. Takes forever to exhaust the pack to complete even a single round. We may try a variant of drawing 2 cards per turn or filling to a determined hand size, like Enemy in Sight.

RATING: 7
A simple card game that should only take a few minutes to learn before getting in to the play (referring to special card rules as required).

However, OMFG!! The Rulebook! How difficult can it make this game sound? It's awful. It was embarrasing trying to explain this when I taught it as the rules made no sense. 

The Rules Primer from the files section here would make a great difference to someone learning the game from scratch. Superb piece of work.

Good game though - simple enough and fun, I will have to try the solitaire version.

A fun game using cards to depict ships, both merchant and raider, for all players.  Can be played with 2-4 players quite easily, offering a decent multi-player experience.  This covers a part of WW-I that is rather obscure, not only in gaming but also in history.  I learned some pretty neat stuff while playing this game and it sparked my interest to do more research on the background history.

Played twice in Wichita and liked it so much I went to Nan's the day I got home.  Fun and fast playing.  The war theme and dice rolling make it closer to a real wargame than most card games.  The battles start making sense and the cards throw some interesting twists into the game.  Each hand can be a scoring fight fest, or can be won with only a few merchants.  I was 3rd with 40 some points on one hand and won with 21 on another.
Thanks to GS in KS for introducing me to this!!!

Okay an awkward game at first. If you’ve ever played Naval War it’s much similar. This is not a war game and I think people were looking for a war game.

I have only played once and thought it was merely ok. It is better than Brawling Battleships, but that is not saying much. I need to look over the rules myself, as I am not a 100% sure that we were doing everything right. It did take way too long for us to do one "hand". It was at least an hour and there were just two of us. I can not imagine wasting three hours in this exercise in boredom. 

It really is not wargame, but I have to disagree with the guy who said that it had "no historical value whatsoever but the illustrations" though. First "historical value" does not lie entirely with the physical qualities of something, but if it helps to expand peoples interest in the subject then it has value. Someone playing this may never even have known about the surface raiding going on during the Great War and now has an interest and decides to explore it more. So, I would say that the game does have some historical value.

If you are interested in the subject matter then I would recommend the book: "The Last Gentleman of of War: Raider Exploits of the Cruiser Emden" by R.K. Lochner. It tells how this German cruiser that sank and captured around 30 Allied ships during WWI. The captain of the ship treated his prisoners with both courtesy and a sense of chivalry that back then captured the attention of the world as he led the British and Australian navies on a merry 'ol chase throughout the Indian Ocean. It is a fascinating read that I highly recommend.

Filler game or late-night action that rounds out a day of gaming quite nicely. I've enjoyed it best with at least four hands at the table--that way you get to spread out the GOTCHA card trumps and interactions that abound in this game. I always end up laughing when I play, even when one player's score tends to take the lead and run away.

But dang, that rulebook makes a relatively straightforward game really difficult to learn. A couple ticks off for that, as it is a bit of a barrier to entry.

Nice to play. Plenty of things happening, highly interactive, plenty of options. It is certainly not a historical simulation but it is a nicely structured game.

I would consider giving it a higher rating if the cards were thicker and of a higher quality.

The GMT edition has superior components and rates higher as a consequence. The one problem, apart from the randomness of combat resolution, is that as the cards are mostly different first-time players take some time to get into the game as they have to read all the cards so see what their options are.

This game suffers for not having been published by the rigth publisher under the correct game label...
It was unfortunately published in a wargame boxed format by GMT...

This NOT A WARGAME at all, it is a plain and simple card game (like Magic or Race to the Galaxy) and it has no historical value whatsoever but the illustrations...

On top of that, as a card game, it is not a good one, not even an average one... Choices are very limited and it is just about playing the cards you draw and roll some dice...
Pointless game...

Have had this game since GMT P500. Remember playing it a couple of years ago with foggy rules explanation - set it aside.

Played it again today (November 5th, 2011) with three players after I had read the rules through thoroughly and we really enjoyed it!

The game has historical flavour - a clean system (despite the rules) - some tough card decisions - an absolute requirement to keep a clear idea of who's winning and act accordingly.

Recommended for anyone who is interested in the period and doesn't mind spending two hours for a three player game of fun and excitement.

Quite a disappointment unfortunately. The cards are hard to read and the game play is very random and repetitive. One round was more than enough for me, even though we tried to speed up the game by drawing two cards at the end of each turn instead of one

RATING: 5
In the end, this is just a dice-rolling combat game.   I have nothing against that, in fact I often love those kind of games, but this one has some problems.  First, it's way, way too long.   Second, the rules must be a disaster, because we struggled to get going.  Third, the graphic design is horrific.  You can barely see the dice icons and points values in front of you, let alone across the table.  But I liked the idea of smaller merchant ships that are replacable and the larger warships/raiders that are not replacable.  That part of the game was cool.   This one needs to be played quickly to be fun, but while learning the cards, that's just not possible.

RATING: 7
The setting of the game I love - WW1 Naval combat. As a card game it isn't bad though it is a bit more opaque than I like which is the element that keeps it on the shelf. I do think it would benefit from a better rule book and a little bit of modern development thrown at it.

Great fun,and easy to setup, explain and play on the first evening upon opening the box.  Although it is more of a war-themed game than a wargame, it demands a lot of care, discipline, and attention to avoid running all the action cards out of your hand (unless the opportunity really does justify suffering a few turns of inaction).

RATING: 3
I expected more here from the initial buzz surrounding this one, but it didn't pay off for me in terms of depth. I like the different dice that you roll, but found the decisions lacking (sometimes the cards pretty much told me what to do) and the card text is so damn small as to be annoying. Furthermore, it commits the crime of more rules than it should for a game of this depth. Pretty much a beer & pretzels game, and there's nothing wrong with that.  Just didn't draw me in enough to go looking for another play.

An improvement over Pacific Typhoon which left me with less than a luckwarm desire to play again.  The game doesn't move much further as the turns were down as the transfer of sunk ships from the play area to the victory piles feel very bland and mechanic.  The theme lends itself to far more drama than this game would have you experience.  Bit of a disappointment but would play again with fast players as there isn't much to do during your turn.

I love the theme and the production by GMT is outstanding.  Ultimately though, I found the game to just be too random and too long.  There is lots of dice rolling and you don't feel like you can control much as the action cards are so difficult to obtain (only one per turn) that you don't feel like you can string combos together to increase your attack odds.  Too bad, I really wanted to like this one.

I think this game represents the tipping point of me being a collector rather than a player - purchased at CANCON 2010 have pulled this out a few times, but the rules are so strangulated that it quickly returns to its box. However, must say that it is possibly the best board game box I have; very sturdy and very nice cover art.  Damn thing is, I sleeved the cards in expectation of playing this game, so I must still make it a priority play(29/11/12).

Just finish playing this solitaire, ended with victory by winning 2 consecutive rounds.  This one is more a card game than a wargame, its in the same league as Pacific Typhoon or Atlantic Storm in my opinion (which is fine company.)  This has more theme than conflict simulation, but it does make a pretty good solitaire game with good narrative.  It may be a little random in terms of throwing the dice for the Phantom Player, but it can get pretty tense at times and there were a couple of important die rolls during my game that got me pretty excited(!) so that is always a good sign.  

There are a few decisions to be made but nothing brain burning and sometimes your choices are a little obvious (I am talking playing solitaire here, this game feels different when you play multiplayer.), so the game takes you for a fun ride, rather than being a puzzle every turn.  Takes the 1.5-2 hours as advertised to play, but things got pretty smooth once I got used to all the card functions again.  

Overall a solid solitaire game.

(I've play this multiplayer before in the past and I think that its better solitaire because it gets pretty slow multiplayer and the game is too long for what you get out of it.  (Unless everyone likes the theme of course).

An interesting little card game that plays well.  The ultimate problem is the length of the game, which requires multiple rounds to balance out the luck factor (which can be huge), and each round takes approximately an hour or more.  It's very fun to use different tactics and weapons to attack the available vessels and since your both running as raiders, it can also be fun to try and grab a prize before your foe.  All in all, decent.

What a missed opportunity. A very cool idea, but playing both sides ruins the entire affair. For a light card/wargame, it's strength could have been building a real affiliation with either British or Germans, but this game leaves you stuck in the middle and shuffling cards. What is the point? I understand the mechanic in the multi-player, but the solitaire game needed a different mechanic. If only the solitaire cards had played the entire British force and you were free to hunt for trophies and avoid British ambushes. If only ....

RATING: 6
An OK naval battle card and dice game.  The graphics are attractive but the functional parts are very small.  It is difficult to read what is in the little circles or tell one dice symbol from another.  On top of that, the game is a little bit repetitive.  On the last turn of the game, you are basically making the exact same decision you made on the first turn of the game.  The scoring system, which rewards you for the order of finish instead of how many points you actually earned, is designed to keep things artificially close.  The game is also full of rules that don't seem to add a lot to the gameplay.  This sort of chrome is usually welcome in a game with a lot of historical flavor, but in this game, which is basically a fast playing card and dice fest, all that rules chrome seems over the top.  The dice mechanic is pretty good.  It is a good game, but just seems like it could have been a lot better in many ways.

A wargame packaged in the form of a simple card and dice game, explained by one of the most painfully convoluted rule books that I've ever had to suffer. You can only average one card play per turn as that's the number that you draw and there's really only one viable course of action: to win you need to sink one or more of the high value military targets, rather than lots of merchantmen. Whether you do or not is entirely down to luck. Some fun, but no real decision making or skill involved.

Initial Rating: 4.5 (September 2014)

I didn’t have much fun playing The Kaiser's Pirates, to be fair, the game explanation wasn’t very good so I will give it another chance. I wanted to check the rules, but they are awful so I desisted. However, at the end of the game, I feel I understood the game so I don’t think I will like it very much.

Most players attack the perceived leader every turn (I’m not fond of this “attack the leader” effect/mechanic), this practically ensures an even game, no matter what, so perhaps this is best as a two player game. If you damaged one boat but failed to sink it, the next player has a massive advantage (another minus for me). It has a lot of dice rolling, not sure yet if the luck is controlled somehow but I feel that’s not the case, however the luck of the draw IS uncontrollable and it bothers me a lot. Some of the cards are very powerful so I feel they are unbalanced. Pure luck if you get them or not.

Art is ok. Theme boring for me.

Bottom line, I feel The Kaiser's Pirates is way too random and way too long for what it offers. I will give it another chance but I don’t think I will ever like it or buy it.

The game is kind of interesting, but not my favorite.  The differing cards and built in fog of war are nice, but the game becomes very luck dependent.  And perhaps the biggest issue is the "I damaged a ship to make it easier for someone else to sink it" problem.  While all the players do that, it can make the game very frustrating.

RATING: 6
A nice wargame-type filler that might just overstay its welcome. Plays a bit easier than the rulebook might suggest at first blush. Not a huge amount of thinking, other than deciding what, if anything, to attack and whether to conserve your action card resources. GMT's production is nice though oddly put in a standard and therefore oversized but still lovely and sturdy box, which is a bit of a downer for me considering that part of the attraction was going to be portability. Have yet to try the solo game, a game with more than two, or a game with any optional rules, whereupon the initial "6" might go up (but probably not down).

Great game on a great untapped theme! I ordered it when I saw it first announced. Our game group has played it extensively over the past two weeks. We even set up our own mini-tournament (the Tournament Balance optional rule is a real positive add-on). I sharpened my skills by first playing the solitaire game before tackling the live players. I hope it is featured at WBC this summer.

Great looking ship card art; the newspaper theme on the actions cards is a nice touch. The various types of dice (d4, d6, d8 and d10) create the various odds without having to apply a list of modifiers for each roll -- well done.  

Out of the box, I had a real problem getting it in my head that the action cards are all double-use. Other card games I played did not have that feature. Once the light went on, I understood that feature just expands the play options. It plays very quickly once you understand the various card types and how to develop a strategy of card combinations at just the right time.

RATING: 3
Rating is based on a 2 player game. Being dependent on both luck of the draw and luck of the dice made this a pretty random affair with not that many interesting decisions to make. Cards which make you take an additional turn or make the next player basically skip their turn are also pretty unfun for the other player.

Might be better if you got 3 or 4 players but with 2 players there's better ways to kill some time.

But I'm a little biased regardless of the player number because of the thematic disconnect of playing both sides at the same time.

Great game, very fun moments like when you steal warship from someone else, intercept his submarine, etc... Reveal and sink raider with powerful British warship.

This game contains lot of luck, it is not real wargame. But if you take this into mind you will find fun game which plays fast.

Not a deeply strategic game but instead a light, fun card game with an interesting theme.  Kaiser's Pirates covers German commerce raiders during World War I.  Players play both the German ships trying to intercept and sink/capture merchantmen and also the British forces trying to find and sink the German raiders and warships.  Cards represent the historical ships that took part in the conflict.  The Action cards are the heart of the game and are duel purpose.  Each Action card can be used as an "Intercept" card (to attack other players ships) or played as the Action printed on the card.  This involves trade-offs.  Intercepts are needed to attack other players and score points, but each card used as an Intercept is an Action lost.  The choices might not be agonizing, but can sometimes be difficult.  Combat or any conflict resolution is resolved by opposed dice rolls with the high roll succeeding.  Different ships use different sets of dice to attack and defend and only the highest number rolled by each player is considered.  So one ship may attack with a ten-sided die while the defender uses a six-sided die.  The odds favor the attacker in this example, but the defender could roll higher and win the battle.  Action cards are the scarce resource of the game.  Each player starts with six cards and receives only one card each turn.  A round of play is over when the Action card deck is exhausted.  A game consists of three rounds of play.  Overall this is  a fun game on an interesting and little-known topic.

Really very simple but looks complex. Lots of reading and understanding to do but decided by lots of dice rolls.

Not sure who it will really work for. Maybe a war gamer looking for a quick filler (though it isn't actually that quick..)

Rule set is horrendous - we wrestled with the rules and where to find different things the whole game.  The differentiation between a British attack and a warship/raider attack could have been better explained in the rule book.  This game is very much a dicefest which can be enjoyable if played quickly.  Played slowly, which is normal for new people or first games, I find it torturous as there isn't enough to keep me interested.  The dice mechanic of each ship using different sided dice to fight or defend and using just the highest number rolled is interesting.

Components are high quality.  Rules are well presented and easy to learn. This game will be getting a fair amount of play at my gaming club.

Cracking good fun. Fast and furious with lots of twists and turns. The game does a surprisingly good job of giving you the feel of the tactics, tricks and dangers of the commerce raiders. There are a lot of subtle advantages and disadvantages to the ships in your force which make the game more sophisticated e.g. raiders vs. warships (more powerful but easy targets), aerial reconnaissance, fast ships, limited supply etc. I recommend you play with most of the optional rules. My one quibble, and the reason my rating isn't higher, is with the solitaire game. The cards just don't create enough actions by the artificial player and life is too easy for the real player, you really lose not only the complexity and suprise of the multi-player game but it becomes plain dull with too many no effect responses. I just play a normal two player game and frankly it loses less in game play than the solitaire game.

--Jul2009-- Based on a single play.  It seems a harmless, if delightfully themed, beer & pretzels weight diversion.  It's possible that the advanced rules (which we didn't use) make things more interesting, but the basic game is inoffensive at best.  I'm definitely willing to give the game another try - once I've a better appreciation of the complete ruleset.  But I'm not confident that I'll be asking for a play a year hence.

A card game with a WW1 naval 'theme', but to me the mechanics don't really reflect that theme.  Good production values (although the box is unnecessarily large), and great to have a real attempt at a solitaire mechanism.  But I still find it to be a somewhat random game of hand-management and die-rolling - die-rolling I understand in a war-game, but the hand-management aspect jars to me (as ships can't just 'appear' where they are needed).  I do like some card-based wartime games (eg the 'Battlecards' series), and generally love naval games, but can't be bothered with this one.  Sorry.

Despite the appearance of a quick action-packed card game, The Kaiser's Pirates is a game that actually takes quite a lot of time to play. 

I am afraid that with a compliment of 4 players this game may not be playable within a single session if one chooses to play with a regular deck of 40 cards. The deck will always need to be thinned down to reduce play time, but I have yet to see how that influences the game-play experience (less cards = less variety).

When I first got this game we struggled with the rules, and only played it a couple of times. A few of my friends said they never wanted to play it again. I think it was the British Attack/Intercept mechanic that wasn't very well explained that got us. We didn't like the rule book. At the time I rated the game 3/10.

Fast forward to this years WBC convention in 2012. I got to see a 3 player game played with the designer in attendance. After seeing the play I re-bought the game. Purchasing two copies in fact (one for a friend).

We have since played it again as a three player game and are anxious to have a go with four players. This has got to be a perfect case of a complete 'turn around' in my attitude towards a game. Now I think it is just great. I probably 'jumped the gun' on evaluating this one before.

However, the rules booklet is at fault. Once the game is 'explained' to you it isn't difficult at all. I think because there are some tricky concepts in there the rules could have been explained better. This is a keeper, and I think it is a great game.

I never had a problem with the components, which are absolutely beautiful.

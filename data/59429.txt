So sad that not all components are included in the box. I need to stop using Kickstarter and wait for it in the local stores so I can exchange it for a complete set.

And from the DDD team, "Dark, Darker, Darkest was a project that we over promised and under delivered."

Living rules are just a lazy excuse to not properly finish a game before sending it to the printers!!

AND GET THIS!!! The creators have created a PDF for you to print on a sticker sheet so you can make THE CHANGES THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE YEARS AGO!! Test your crap before you flush it! I can't even sell this for $10!!

I am usually not a big fan of pure coop games, but DDD manages to keep me interested. Its like a coop should be: Telling a story, interesting choices like a puzzle, lots of different events and monsters, unpredictable and brutually hard to win.

Kickstarter Premium Edition.  This is a good game unfortunately marred by a horrific Kickstarter campaign and Queen Games' utter contempt for their customers. If you don't mind the randomness of everything being decided by dice rolls then this is a worthy survival horror game. It really is Resident Evil: The Board Game - searching a house for the antidote to a virus whilst battling fire, zombies, mutant creatures and a big boss finale.

I am no kickstarter supporter, so I don't suffer from the failed campaign. Therefore, I'll rate the game, not the campaign.

This is one of the favourite games in our gaming group. Every playthrough feels tense and keeps the excitement running. Afterwards, we will stay and discuss the possibilities, especially when we lost.

I never played anything than the lowest difficulty and I don't think higher difficulty (darker or darkest mode) will make the game more enjoyable.

I do own the kickstarter specials and those are in parts pretty good expansions (I have rated those in detail).

I usually don't rate my games for obvious reasons, but if some seem to feel they can protest-rate the game and give it a "1" without playing it, I think I am more objective after having played the game more than 120 times.
I still love playing the game, as each session generates its own tense storyline. I am often amazed myself how many crucial tactical decissions the system generates. Sometimes changing the order of the action performed by a group of characters inside a doomed situation can be the difference between life and death. I just love those desperate situaions, with a wounded team fighting against overwhelming odds, just winning with one or two actions to spare in the finale. I truly had some of my most memorable gaming experiences playing Dark Darker Darkest.

:d6-1: This co-op is possible to play solo and has been described as a very good one to play solo too.

Looks really cool and thematic. It is described as "Resident evil in a box" so it isn't any of that "scared civilians running around trying to escape" but more of a monster-mashing madness with parts of exploring and adventure. I like the art and there seems to be a lot of rules and complexity too.

Not sure about this one. Really wanna like it. Great theme, great art, one of the greatest box arts out there...still, the gameplay doesn´t really capture me. The minis are too small and pretty boring, I don´t like that in this house, there are barely any walls...makes no sense.
Original rules are a mess. Very ambitious game, but it kinda needed more developement.
Maybe one day I´ll get more into it.

RATING: 3
Really disappointed. The game sounded well in theme and design, but the rules are rather ill-balanced and worse, the print is of astonishingly bad quality. There are printing errors on multiple pieces, spelling/grammar errors litter both the english and the german manual, and both sound as if they were heavily changed last minute without further editing or QA.

Considering how quickly this had to be printed for the Spiel 2013, I suspect QA was skipped *entirely*. Not unsurprising seeing how important the Spiel is, but disappointing. Also, silence in regards to replacement pieces so far.

Thing is, the base underlying idea sounds good!
But the mix of shoddy quality, too high price (for this quality), lack of clear rules and many non-intuitive elements to the rules make it annoying to play. You spend more time explaining or frustratingly flipping the rules than actually playing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Decent zombie game, not the best but pretty good. The inclusion of the door locks/color codes make this almost more of a mystery game with zombies than a zombie shooter, though there's plenty of that too. 

I love that you have a huge incentive to stick together: splitting the group not only doubles zombie and fire activations, but increases the likelihood of multiple cameras seeing you and makes you less able to fend off attacks. On the other hand, you often have to split up to accomplish things quickly, sending someone to go put out a fire or enter a code into the corner room. Weighing the pros and cons of this really makes for some interesting decisions.

The one thing I hate is that most of the events are determined by dice. You roll to hit zombies, they roll to hit you, you roll to defend yourself, you roll to determine zombie spawn location, you roll to see if the cameras see you, you roll to see where the fire spreads, you roll to see what terror will plague you next. This makes for a game that can shift from having nothing on the board to having 12 zombies and a creature inside your space all in a single turn. This can lead to really frustrating situations that you have no control over: two or three bad rolls could change the game from super easy to impossible in the blink of an eye. Other than that, pretty fun.

OK zombie killing game.  Nice artwork.  Good components.  The gameplay doesn't grab me.  Zombie movement rules are poor, resulting in packs of zombies standing around doing nothing because they are too far away from the players.  I like the combat system.  Fire was not a factor in our game, but I can see where it could liven things up if it sparks up on the other side of the house from you and has a chance to spread.  A big weakness for me is the search/terror die mechanism.  It has a lot of variability, so one game could be quite easy with few terror results while another is brutal with fire, creatures, etc.  I prefer Zombicide, but I can see where DDD could be fun if random events fall a certain way.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.75
Solid game with some great mechanisms.  Love the security cameras, fire, and multi-tracker.  One thing really holding this game back though is the lack of variety in scenarios.  Beyond all of the chrome you're really just going room to room searching for items while trying to minimize damage around you.  In that way it's derivative of many other coops.

If there was an expansion of additional scenarios featuring alternate goals (exploration/searching for an item/escaping/etc.) this would be a great game.  The core elements are very solid.

SOLO PLAY:

1 Player Minimum
5 Player Maximum
Steep learning curve. Make sure you have a generous amount of time to sit down and learn the game. Clever mechanics in the game regarding the locked tokens.

The revised rule book is much better but still not 100% clear. So far I have spent more time reading, rereading trying to figure out the game than I have actually played the game.

I tried it again after 2 years. Read rules for 3 hours, started playing. It is clunky, fiddly and tedious to play. I started thinking about all the other tactical co op games in my collection: Zombicide, Gears of War, and many many others. I asked myself, "why am I playing this." I could not answer the question.

Don't waste your time on this undeveloped bloated mess of a game. 
Out of my collection!

Rules Notes:
-May remove 1 Code Token at a terminal, but the darkness track advances to the right one space. (Pretty much forced to find the exact 3 code chips)

Our first game was terrible.
1h30 to go over the rules once more before playing.
2h30 of "playing" (reading the rules, really.)
Getting confused by contradicting and/or unclear sentences.
Realizing we've had no fun after 4h invested in it.
We all felt the game had potential, but the broken rulebook completely killed it.
Also, my character was a firefighter and I really wish I could have lead the group and fight oncoming hordes of zombies.
But instead, I was forced to stick with the group at all costs (quickly died of zombification the one time I stepped alone into an adjacent room) and do whatever little I could.
Last thing: Ending your turn with action points left because of a lack of possible good moves in a race against the clock kind of game is extremely unsatisfying.

Game designer is passionate/determined enough to personally contact me about the revised rules, which I appreciate.
Not sure when/if we'll ever give it another try, but I certainly appreciate the effort.

Great Game, wake me up for a session (or 2, ...)!

Superb atmosphere (not only due to the art-work), great mechanics.

Done multiple playtests from somewhere in the beginning till a much, much later stadium. The game evolved to a great gaming experience. Still have one of the original Tyrants laying as a souvenir. 

The mechanic of using color codes was a major improvement!

Keep up the great work.

One play so far (which appears to be one more than most of the other raters have done). A lot of things (dice, locks, random board config, lack of fire, no creature) came together to make it kind of easy. All the KS expansions make things tougher, though, so if it wasn't just a fluke, upping the difficulty will be simple.

Definitely print out a play aid with the sequence of play and action list before playing. We could have avoided a ton of flipping around the rulebook. It's really not complicated, but it takes a while to get into the flow.

That said, it was great fun and the rules were very tight. I am optimistic that my initial positive reaction will hold up.

Excellent mix of cooperative action and puzzles.  Very thematic and great combination of fighting and problem-solving.  Complex rules make things a little fiddly, but it's a deep game. High replayability makes it something you can keep going back to. Zombie theme and dark elements limit my overall play instances depending on group members.  Not really appropriate for those younger than middle teens.

I'm not a big fan of zombies (or horror movies) which might affect my view of the game. Despite some nice ideas when it comes to cooperation and enemy moves I found the game quite boring and uninspiring. Move there, do a search, have zombies spawn and swamp you, run away, search again, open door etc. 

I realize this is true for many games of this type, but where I'm at least having fun playing Descent and similar games I could not muster any excitement at all here despite putting several shotgun rounds into the boss winning the game.

Very good game mechanic - keeps tense through out the game. It forces you to stay together. If you split - and you have to split - game replies immediately (simply zombies hit you two times more often). Once the nemesis is on the board - the time is running 5x quicker. You should be afraid. There was no such thing on the market before.

Coop and Zombies aren't really my bag, but i had fun with this. There will be a lot of zombies as you roll to see if/how many will appear at least once per turn, sometimes many more. You and your fellow characters run around a randomly roomed house looking for items to both fend them off and unlock a series of keycodes to save the world/release the big boss. Its sort of like Resident Evil 1 combined with flashpoint fire rescue. Its pretty hard, and there are a variety of special zombie types and boss enemies that won't turn up every game to keep things different. The characters also have some basic rpg mechanics (xp, new skills etc) to them.

If you are looking for a zombie game this is probably the one to go for, its both shorter and more interesting than the competition.

(And now I know there will be a lot of plastic Zombies included... (I will rate this 10+)

2013 Now a Kickstarter backer premium level.

I played this game more then ten times since I received it.
At the beginning, the rules are a bit hard. But the designer of the game is active on BGG to answer questions. So the rulebook is not really a negative point for me. 
The game itself is just great. Every turn, the  group has to make important decisions. Creatures spawn right next to them just to ruin the perfect plan. Fires break out and the group has to stop the fire from destroying the house. Do we want to search in a big group, getting more stuff but risking to make too much noise? Stay together or split up?
Its a game everybody I played with was involved in diskussions and planning. An every reaction I got after playing was: "Can we play again?" or "Can you bring this next time?"
I had just one person who didn't like the game. But this girl was just writing messages on her mobile phone while i explained the rules to the group. This made clear to me: Everyone has to understand the reactions of the zombies and creature and how the house works. Otherwise they can't get involved in the game. 
Great Boardgame!

Rating based solely based upon a reading of the rules and some feedback by the designer - actual play probably will influence it. 

The desire to play this game (if ever published) is medium. I will certainly want to 'try before I buy'.

Edit 14/12/2010 - I was apporached by the desinger with the kind request to remove my rating.

I declined, and therefore am singlehandedly responsible for the collapse of the Belgian game-designer scene (or so it would seem). Never again will a Belgian author be published - never ...

There is a well thought out game here, but it suffers from having to print out a new set of rules right out of the gate(Queen should offer these in new editions already) as well having too many moving parts for simple actions. It's not bad, but trying to remember it all will take some time as well as getting through the revised rules. I do like that it is unique and doesn't come off as a Zombicide/dudes on a map clone, so that's a plus. My main beef is that I don't think I can get this to the table with people unless I can teach the rules at auctioneer speed, or send videos on how to play a week beforehand. 

I actually don't mind the rules to be honest. The game is a different style of zombie game which is definite breath of fresh air. My main beef has been that Queen games as of 2012 till now have been releasing some half-assed, incomplete games and they continue to do, as proven by the comments about those who have supported there recent kickstarters. Why, after 4 years have they not bothered to put revised rules into the game, which the designer has made. They refuse to support their games past release and I'm cooling my jets on most of their games from this day forward.

Great game. Lots of tension and challenging decisions at every turn. Really captures the feel of horror survival. Very flexible in difficulty level, and has amazing replay value. Introduces  a few new mechanics that are likely to become staples of coop games in the future.

Don't listen to the whiners and the haters. This is a game worth playing by anyone who likes this type of theme or just enjoys a really good coop game. As a bonus, it play really well solo.

My first impression of this is that it is a decent zombie game. I enjoyed it more than Last Night on Earth. It's a bit fiddly and has a lot of unclear rules (though the game is definitely playable with this latest rulebook), but it's thematic and fun to play. I definitely want to play it a few more times.

Update: I've played this game a few more times. It greatly improves as you get the rules questions ironed out. Even using the same house layout, each game can be vastly different. I really do enjoy this one quite a bit.

Kickstarted! *missing pieces and add-ons*

Zombie-style Pandemic, with decent premise and player involvement. HOWEVER, the manual in the box was written by someone different than the designer --- so ignore it and get the revised rules here from BGG. That lessens the flaws of the game play dramatically. The minis are also a bit indistinct... assuming you got them all. Queen Games should be banned from Kickstarter for running out of pieces mid-shipment, and waiting months to start working on replacing what's missing (not to mention delaying the add ons).

PLUS: intensity, level of challenge
BIG MINUS: indistinct figures, heavy luck factor, inability to keep looking for ammo
DOUBLY BIG MINUS: expansions in the Kickstarter campaign are delayed indefinitely
MEGA HUGE SUPER-SIZED MINUS: the manual - horribly written and requiring the revised one by the actual creator
SUPER MEGA HUGE SUPER-SIZED MINUS: bad behaviour in the Kickstarter campaign really turned players off on this

Solid 8 for solo play, I play with 4 survivors.  I'd give it a 9 for multi-player, hence the 8.5.

This game has two things going for it.

First, the co-op mechanics are different from other games. They squash the alpha-player and REALLY make you play as a group.  Never seen it done like this, but it is now the new high bar.

Second, the euro mechanics are very thematically implemented and really make the whole zombie theme in a mansion shine.

Very impressed.  Ausloo goes on my list of designers to watch.

A cooperative game where the players are attempting to find an antidote to stop the zombie apocalypse. The characters enter Dr. Mortimer's mansion where they battle zombies, mutants, and sudden fires. Security cameras and the spreading zombie plague make things even more difficult. This game has an innovative system that makes cooperation very interesting. It is replayable, especially with all of the kickstarter bonus items (extra board sections, villains, zombies, etc). The board is modular with random events throughout each game.

Way too many rules for what this game offers. The zombies pile up so quickly in such a confined area that they're impossible to avoid for any length of time. You quickly become entrapped or infected and are more or less doomed. I particularly don't like the cancel icons on the dice. You only have a 2 in 6 chance of rolling a hit to begin with and then when you do - bingo you also rolled a cancel. I also find it too difficult to get the key codes. This game was a big disappointment for me.

RATING: 8.5
In "Dark Darker Darkest", gamers are presented with a scenario that borrows liberally from "Resident Evil", but also adds some new twists.  You're not just worrying about what goes bump in the night.  The poor survivors traversing the Mortimer mansion have to contend with security cameras, locks and fires too.

Proves to be a rather engrossing mashup of American and Euro styles.  This has also quickly become one of my favorite games to play solo.

RATING: 6
A shambling behemoth of a game,  Dark, Darker, Darkest has a number of interesting ideas loosely packed into a shallow narrative.  On the one hand, the game is quite complicated (and made more so by some vague and/or poorly-worded rules), but on the other hand, the game feels too shallow.  Perhaps, shallow isn't quite the right word.  You have a lot of choices and flexibility in the actions you can take, their timing, etc.  But ultimately, the actual result of any action is random, so those choices affect the odds at best, and absolutely nothing at worst.

I would play if asked, but will likely not suggest it myself.  And I'll insist that at least one player has the FAQs memorized before we start.

First game was an interesting experience.  For once I played a zombie game in which I didn't want to run screaming from the table because of the game being boring.  The term "sandbox" is being thrown around a bit regarding this game in that you can construct quite a bit of the dynamics of this game and shape it the way you prefer to experience the game...even within the base game without including the expansions.  There is definitely some validity to this concept.  There is no story-line or line up of scenarios either - one game and done so to speak as each could play quite differently.  

The collaboration mechanism is interesting - dividing into multiple groups or going off solo is definitely putting the team at risk as both fire and zombie activations can/will become much more frequent...and zombie hordes are dangerous to 1-2 humans in many circumstances.  Be careful splitting up and stick together as much as possible.  

Game occurs in two parts - one as you search for the code to enter the lab and the second occurs if you found the key in time and you face the nemesis whom you must destroy before s/he burns down the corners of the house.  

Rule set is a bit of a mess and there are a couple misprints but nothing extremely offputting to me.  I'm a bit frustrated that the glow in the dark zombies really weren't an expansion as I believed.

Finally played this using the revies rules. Lots of backlash due to questionable decisions by Queen games during the Kickstarter and unclear rules. The revised rules are pretty good although still too long and not as clear as one would hope as players need to read the examples to understand, that being said, the game is actually pretty good and customizable. I really should have gotten this on the table sooner, but with 500+ games it's hard to win table space!

EDIT:

1. I am amazed and want to hold David Ausloos in high regards: When he learned about my harsh criticism of DDD, he and I (and another gamer from Germany) have shared our thoughts and exchanged opinions about the current status of the game. I really did not expect something like this to happen; but I really, really, really appreciate this - especially because this reflects the blood and tons of effort David Ausloos puts into this game; and I feel how much this game is kind of an heart-issue for him. I respect this and want to honor this.
That is why ...
2. My friends and I are actually looking forward to playing the game another time - probably sooner than later, especially now that the FAQ 2.0 are available.
3. That's why I have removed my rating for this game for now; and I also ask you to consider my thoughts after this editing as a game-play experience in which my friends and I simply tried to play the games with RAW (rules as written) and without the help of FAQs ... Depending on what we will have on our next game-session I may change the criticism ... !
/edit

Original criticism:

Today I played this game with four friends.
The theme was tempting, the idea behind the game was kind of trashy and funny and reminded me a bit of Betrayal at the House on the Hill with the excpetion that the story is much more focussed on a specific story. That's fine.

Then hell broke loose:

- The rules are not untuitive as well as very ambigous with the latter getting worse when you just compare the rules of the various translations of the game; what seems to be crystal clear in the English version of the rules becomes a riddlewhen you learn that the "same" rules in the German rulebook are vague at best - and vice versa;
- even worse: the German rulebook at least is not complete (!!!!), which was very frustrating;
- the rulebook tries to keep it as simple as possible, but lacks doing so by spreading rules for certain parts of the game on different pages or hiding important tidbits at unexpected locations within the book;
- over the complete time it took to play the game we were not able to establish a consistent game with as little mistakes as possible - really, even FFG does btter rules!;
- what killed us was the start of the Endgame-part of the game, 'cause it put several rules up-side down and established a nearly completely new gameplay - WHY?;
- annoying was the fact that the firefighter was literally bound by his task keeping fires under control, and that the Asian IT-specialist really does not add a lot to the game; these two gamers were nearly not involved in the game and had little opportunity to develop their characters, which is a shame considering the co-op nature of the game;
- the game-material is OK, neither especially good and high quality nor extraordinarily bad; considering the pricing of game it is kind of a bummer regardless, 'cause the cardboard parts of the game are not convincing; the artwork looks pretty much average quality and lacks "the spirit"; and the design decisions in many parts of the game (multitrack, character-sheets, item-cards) are really not worth mentioning - at least not in high tones.

This game was such a blast in a negative sense, that I have little trouble choosing a rating of "2", although a "3" might be arguable. But for anything better than that it is required to get someone to recreate and revise and re-edit the rules; also there needs to be a lot more gameplay-testing in order to make the game better, because the theme deserves it.

What is so utterly frustrating is the simple fact that you really see the idea and love put into the game, but the performance in creating a good or at least solid game is bad - and even worse than that ... 

I am sorry. In my opinion this game is a huge disappointment and fail ...

tl;dr

Excellent zombie horror game. Tough as hell to win because it really beats you down hard. You almost need to tweak the map layout every game in order to give yourself a fighting chance. I`d like to see the designer provide some pre-set maps with difficulty rankings.
The rule book sucks, but it`s not a game killer. There`s plenty of help on BGG.

edit: David came through and revised the rules for clarity as well as a few key rule changes. The rules are now more than acceptable and provide plenty of great examples of play and most importantly, map setup, which can make or break the game. Now all I need is to win a game.

Poorly written instructions, too many symbols to manage with the 3 different manuals included. Played three times, each time playing felt futile (even after tweaking board setting), could not move around the board very much. Mission of game to me was just staving off inevitably losing the game, while basically stuck in a corner, for as long as possible. Losing a game is definitely okay if you are having a good time while playing, but this type of losing was not.

Hard rules, had to study it throughfully to get it. And at the end of the game, the mechanics change to become almost a new game.

Appart from that, it really gives me the feel of "resident evil" being in a mansion, crowded of zombies. Having such a limmited amount of ammo.... and the best of it is that the game forces you to cooperate and go all together ... but going all together may end up consuming too much time.

This rating is based on my reading the rules. I haven't played the game yet. Rating might increase after playing.

After reading the rules I got even more interested in playing this game soon. A zombie-survival game with depth? Unheard off :)

It feels like a good game that already has an expansion included. Some "book keeping" but after 1 or 2 turns it will stick. Plenty of mechanics to keep you entertained with many decisions to make that will determine if you and your party are successful. This might be a zombie game that my wife even will love to play :)

The designer rewrote the rulebook a while ago, so be sure to get that one, as the rules out of the box are prone to errors and incompleteness. Even then, I consider it a miss. The game in itself is ok, but for current standards, I would have expected more. It's just not fun, more of a chore...

Great thematic game - horrible rulebook, even the revised version.

RATING: 2
An incoherent mess. The revised rules aren't enough to save the game, as it is still filled with little rules exceptions and circumstantial cases that are a chore to remember. Aside from that, Dark Darker Darkest feels like a game that is trying to capture the spirit of the original Resident Evil, but ends up feeling like a way more convoluted version of Zombicide. I ended up cannibalizing this game for the minis and cubes, because my copy from Amazon looked like someone elbow dropped it before shipping it out. Unfortunately, this means that Resident Evil: The Board Game is still something that needs to exist, as the scary mansion setting is way under-utilized when it comes to zombies, specifically.

Although I certainly didn't think it was as bad as many seem to (at least while playing with the revised rules), it really isn't all that great either.

Preliminary rating based on playing the prototype. 

Without giving too much away...there is so much going on in this game and the mechanics and artwork are integrated perfectly to create an intuitive yet deeply thematic gameplay experience. Players must efficiently work together, leveraging found items and unique level up character abilities to solve the game's "puzzle". The challenge is that much needs to be explored and discovered and success is only achieved through making smart decisions, as a team; leveraging the game's clever dice mechanics. Tension constantly builds throughout the game until the end phase is reached. Only if enough players have effectively leveled up, surviving the wave of zombies and other unearthly creatures will there be a chance to overcome what hides behind the final locked door...what will it be this time ?

I usually don't rate games in prototype form but figured a rating based on play is better than one based on reading a preliminary version of the rules. This game has tremendous potential. Might be a 10 for me. The artwork is a perfect 10. Will update my rating once I get my must have copy.

RATING: 4
For all the set-up and the not-so-great rulebook layout it has very little payout and a difficulty setting that has the chance to make the game un-winnable? It also seems like 5 players is always going to be easier than fewer. Going to try again, just to say I beat it. This is a good learning opportunity for how not to write a rule book.
The art was pretty though and it had some great concepts. I really liked the experience point system and how dynamic the combat was.

Played a couple of solo games and found them quite fun, hence my initial rating of 8. Then I played a four player game and it all came crashing down: fiddly, clunky, no real drama - just random swings and when the boss showed up we killed him in one move. Sorry, I wanted to like this game, but there are so many other games in the dungeon crawl genre that is so much better.

(1 play)  A fun addition to survival horror type of games.  You have to battle through the rules to make this game work.  Had the game been smooth and clear in understanding, it may have risen above many others.  As it stands, if you like how it works overall, I think you could chisel a good game out of it.  Myself, probably won't play again unless a gaming buddy really gets into it.

Big and hard as heck, this coop has a good vibe going for it. One has to figure out the whys of fighting these monsters in the mansion, but assuming there is a good reason, the rest just falls in place. There is a very tactical feel to the game, and getting ways to mitigate luck early appears to be key to be able to succeed. Game may be swingy, but it was entertaining. Got to play it more times.

Im rating this on one almost played through solo mission.
At first I thought it was pretty boring but as a few rounds passed it really picked up. I love the fire spreading,The code thing is pretty neat,Once you get the Multitracker down you will learn to love it. I cant say how many times you will want to play this,but it is fun.

The down side is,,set up is time consuming with little cubes,boards,cards,mini's etc. The Rules are not very good. The boards/rules had a few misprints. The mini's dont look very good. The box has very nice art work,,but the storage is Horrible! I mean it's just big open areas,ok I can deal with that but you cant even fit the Team Tracker down in there!!

Over all once you get a feel for how the game works,and look up rules "and they do squeeze a lot of little rules in" It gets pretty fun.

I Kickstarted Dark Darker Darkest.

Fortunately, the game is incredible. It has quickly become my favourite survival horror game. It offers compelling choices, a strong narrative, and a palpable sense of dread.

First impression after one play: Meh! I don't know why but the game left me cold. To me it seems that the mechanics and the theme do not mix as well as you would expect from a Zombie game. Plays quite dry. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I have missed the Kickstarter hype, and scandal, so I had no expectations when I got this. 

It's tense, and very thematic, beautifully produced,  the zombies are owerwhelming in numbers, the ammunition is scarce, fire can be devastating. 

My only problem is that there could be a greater variety of...everything...  especially for this high price.
It gets a bit boring after some plays.

Update: rated down again and again, as I have the feeling that this game was designed to frustrate and torture people instead of entertaining them.

DDD is a beast of a game and in my view the epitomy of Ameritrash: it is a zombie game and players have individual powers with the ability to level up, but you also have your mad scientist with mythological creatures in his house, in which fires and explosions can happen - and the resolution of many actions depends on die rolls.

The game is a really tough and long coop; on the easiest difficulty we could barely snatch a win and the guy running the game told us we were doing exceptionally well. There are quite a lot of decisions like if you want to take a risk of encountering these nasty beasts (a swing of bad luck can really hit you there) or do something saver instead; there are also some ways to avoid hoardes of zombies. The main mechanism of progression (unlocking doors with arbitrary combinations of colors which are assigned to your items) is rather unthematic and tagged on, but works rather well from a game mechanic perspective.

In our game we had a lot of controversial discussions, which is a very good sign for a coop. In comparison to the similar Zombicide, which is more action packed and straightforward, DDD is rather puzzly (and unforgiving). However, with all the different elements and player powers in this game, there are so many rules and special cases that I had quite some trouble to keep track of what's going on (and from what I have heard the rulebook is rather bad). In a coop that is not too bad, if you have one or two people confident in the rules (as it was the case in our group). I would rate the game a 5, if I would have to go through the rules and be the one in charge of running the game, but about a 7 if I can just enjoy the ride.

With the revised rulebook and completely ignorant of the drama surrounding it.

In a just world, we would have all been playing Dark Darker Darkest as our go-to bloated themey dice fest instead of Arkham Horror's tedious nonsense. Not a masterwork but a fun survival horror theme. More fun than RE1 and quicker to play with fewer tedious box pushing puzzles.

The fact that this is a game system that lets you behind the curtain is obvious when the game tells you to build the board but DDD is rewarding if you get past tht hurdle.

RATING: 8
DDD has a great theme and setting. The production values are high for the components and the artwork for the map tiles is interesting, which was further improved by the large variety of map tiles provided during the Kickstater.

The gameplay mechanics were initially hard to grasp, requiring me to ask/post a series of questions on BGG, but the games creator was very responsive and has even provided an up-to-date FAQ. I know some people have issues with the quality of the miniatures, but considering their scale (smaller than Zombicide miniatures) they were very well detailed, IMHO.

The game itself is fairly difficult, even after understanding the rules and for my group we've employed a series of house rules to help us out. The difficulty seems to be a mix of locating/opening locks (which requires finding the correct items/colours) while at the same time avoiding negative events while searching (rolling doubles), ever-growing zombie horde spawns, security cameras, fires, and the chance of being infected by the zombie virus. And most of all, the fact that we only have 15 rounds to get into the Lab or we lose the game regardless of our situation. Obviously we haven't tried a difficulty level above "Dark", nor have we used the KS add-ons like special zombies, helicopter escape, or radioactivity.

Even so, when everything does fall into place during a game it pretty damn amazing. A pity that doesn't happen as much as we would like (yet).

Good ideas on the mechanics and setting but killed by the ambigious hot mess of rules.  I am sure the community will eventually fix this game up and make it enjoyable, but for now it is not.  Not interested in spending hours to read up all the extra rules that should've been explained the first place.  Makes me thing that this was pushed out before being playtested extensively.

RATING: 7
Fiddly. However, the complexity of the rules are worth it. This is the best zombie movie simulation I've seen -- knockback, retreat, boss monsters, etc. Read the reviews before the rules, since the game has some odd concepts (eg. locks that you use to unlock the final boss'es door) that are odd. Also, get the reference sheets -- it's annoying that the cards do NOT fully explain how the cards and skills work. Would have been nice to have more creatures and nemesises. Miniatures are kind of plain. Once you know the rules, the game is a 9. But the components and rulebook (not an easy task to learn this game) knock it down a few points.

I refused to spend time with this game for over a year, due to the KS fulfillment. Delays upon delays, bad communication and lot of chase to manage to get what I should. And the miniatures? What a dissapointment...
I decided to give it a chance recently, so I report:
Learning time; Reasonable. One go at the revised rules+a youtube walkthrough and I was good to go. It seems to me that it's going to be easy to teach to others after you know what to do.
Gameplay; Seems solid and interesting. Some nice mechanics. I like the "puzzle" aspect. Remains to see how balanced it is.
Atmosphere; Great! You are at the middle of a zombie apocalypse and you are screwed. And you feel that. From the very first moment. Before you even got the chance to move you may have spawned 2-3 zombie packs. And they may already have a go at you. No you are not in a b-movie with a happy end. You will probably not make it. That alone can give you more than enough satisfaction if you make it.
Replayability; High. Different room placement+random spawns make every game different. And then there are extra rules, extra zombie types, adjusting difficulty...
Components; Hmmmm... The paper parts are nice. Dice are nice too. The miniatures...I consider them dissapointing. They are not miniatures. They are game parts. And DDD was sold as a miniature game. Have to admit that if they were larger there would be a problem when more than 20 zombies are stuck in a room.
All in all; This game suffered a terrible blow from an ill-fullfiled KS. In the end what it offered did not reflect the money it asked. Yes Glow in the Dark Dice and Zombies seem a cool idea but they have no practical use. 100+Euro is not a fair deal at all. My worst KS by far. Light years far. For 30$ that I see it here in the market? Awesome! I liked the game. May increase the rating after more plays, if it prove to be indeed so good and the fun and time spent with it justify the high price.

There are some things in this game that do not make sense thematically:
- Doors are unlocked with items, because they have the codes "engraved" (I would have preferred separate key cards)
- You can't simply run from even a single zombie (zombies are just too smart and fast it seems ...)
- Only survivors in the same group can combine items to open locks, being in the same room isn't enough

Also I would have preferred some kind of event cards to spice up the (basically non-existing) narrative, in this otherwise quite predictable and repetitive game.

My rating reflects the gameplay, mechanics and thematic experience. Would have been a ten if not for bad rule book... And mediocre miniatures...

After ten plays, I gotta say, this is a game I would have liked more if there weren't so many things to figure out and upkeep. Also play time is an hour too long for what it provides.  

Many concepts are not consistent... Like item management, why an antidote can't be passed, why a zombie wld stand in a room and burn without flinching but wouldn't move through a room to get at survivors... These sort of inconsistency causes a lot of rules referencing. There has gotta be ways to shorten this game. 

The last boss phase seems initially very exciting but in the end, it is all about the layout and planning for the house and what the last room provides. It is possible to kill the boss in a single turn, in fact that's the way it shld be done if not u will be getting killed...

Interesting game and surely better than something like zombicide for the price. best coop zombie game out there in my book.

 PS, I have not tried Carnival zombie yet, and that might be the messiah to save the zombie genre.

New Zombie type game, meant to be co-op, so can solo, although the designer thinks it wouldn't work so well and would lose some key aspects, but sounds good regardless. Bit darker than usual, long time in production. You play the AI, that controls the house you have to infiltrate, and then avoid cameras, monsters, traps etc.

It is out now, still expensive (£65 or so) reviews are mainly good, bad reviews coz of poor kickstarter campaign.

A fantastic game! Congrats to David Ausloos!!!
If you ever played Resident Evil, then you know what´s awaiting you...This game is RE as a board game, but only better and far more intense, like the grand finale of a zombie movie.
I own Zombicide and its expansion and sequel as well as Zpocalypse. I must say that all of those games have their qualities and cover different aspects of the zombie-theme.
DDD for my taste is the best of the three, because it creates the most immersive experience and is very atmospheric. I love the intelligent mechanics, the simplicity and the beautiful art. The storyline that unfolds is different every time you play. What I´m really looking forward to are the possible expansions that could be easily made either officially or by BGGeekers: Just think about all those miniguns, rocket launchers, new evil characters/creatures (just think about the  real "nemesis" of RE or a corporate special unit pursuing their own interests...), heroes,special abilities and TONS of stuff!!!!  Yessssss, baby!

One last word about the components: They are top notch, very beautifully drawn and contribute immensely to the atmosphere. Very very professional!

Two solo plays.

This one snuck up on me. Because of the combination of poorly executed Kickstarter and high expectations this one is often judged on things beyond the game itself. Because of that I stayed away despite following this one early in the design process.

I finally got it when it became cheap and was pleasantly surprised. This game really works well. It is very challenging, but can be tweaked enough to give one a better chance without changing the game. 

The components both high quality and serve the gameplay. It also creates the appropriate atmosphere. There are "gamey" aspects that don't completely follow the theme, but they do enhance gameplay and I think that is a worthy reason to break with the in-game "realism".

The game truly is a puzzle to be solved with no one part of the action diluting or overwhelming the game. 

I really look forward to more solo and team play.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 2


Overall - 1

This game is pretty boring.  You simply walk around killing zombies until you open some locks.  A lot of decisions are counter intuitive to how things actually work.  It makes sense to attack zombies so you can level up.  In fact you want the weakest people to attack (In real life you wouldn't you'd stay away).  The movement of zombies don't make sense.  you have to open very specific lock many of which don't go anywhere or make sense.

Definitely one of my favorite games. You'll need to download the updated rule book from boardgamegeek.com And then you'll need to spend some time going thru it. But it's time well spent.

I tried for many plays and many hours to try and like this game, but sadly, it's just not possible. Even when stacking the game in your favor, it still doesn't work. You can tweak it by setting up the manner the way you want instead of random, eliminating camera tiles or adding more search tiles or defense tiles, you can remove the higher number Spawn Tokens, remove 1 or 2 colors from the lock codes, make a deck of equal amounts of color coded items and it still doesn't work. It sounds fantastic when someone is explaining it to you, it looks fantastic with all of it's theme and pieces, but it just doesn't come together at any point in the game. You'll get halfway through, and then someone pulls the rug out from under you...every...single...time. High rating of 4 only because of it's potential.

The designer's rewritten rule book (in the file section) is excellent and I really appreciate the section at the end on possible tweaks to adjust the challenge; I can't bring myself to house rule games but I can use the designer's suggestions no problem!

This game is certainly tough to beat but then I'm only 2 games in and usually take an age to work out strategies so others' mileage may vary. I enjoy the ride however and DDD is a very thematic, tense ride indeed, helped along by some very nice components (as is usual from Queen Games). Not sure why they used such a huge box though!

It took me a long time to get this on the play list but now that I have I'm very much enjoying it.

I didn't have any of the problems that most people had with this game's KS campaign, mostly because I only pledged for the base game and no add-ons. I was impressed with the speedy delivery.

When I bumped into a fortuneteller at the local buffet, she channeled a spirit and whispered that the next boardgame I played would have serious pacing and difficulty issues.  She was spot on, so now I feel bad about snatching the last breakfast burrito off her plate when she stumbled into the fryer.

The bulk of DDD is just so logistical and dull.  You group up, search, group up, search, etc. It's like watching a rugby game where the players do nothing but scrum.

Many things can go wrong, sure, but not in an entertaining way.  More like a "hopefully this will end the game sooner" way.  Between room set-up, zombie and lock placement, hazard rolls, and discovered items, you're 80% certain to be totally screwed.  We happened to fall into the lucky 20% our first game, but I can't imagine that will ever happen again.

There are all sorts of cliches that apply to DDD: half-baked being the most obvious. But I'll take it one step further and argue that the designer popped the pan in the oven and then forgot to turn it on.

Looks great, features Zombies, and it's even Belgian made. I've generally been disappointed by Zombie games. This one is ok. It has some nice mechanics, but somehow doesn't grab me. The variety in enemies is somewhat a dissapointment, movement of zombies is quite odd. I did however like the action system and the end fight mechanics, even though the rules are very unclear about that.

So, you could do worse than play this, while waiting for an epic zombie game.

The theme is certainly there. The rules are very unclear and we spent more time than I'm used to scouring the rulebook and online FAQs in an attempt to decode the sloppy rules and iconography.

I somewhat enjoyed playing this and would consider playing again as long as someone knew the game back to front. We lost both our attempts.

Definitely want, but at a cheap price and with all expansions OR a second edition.

Nem volt rossz, de ha már ilyen stílus, akkor Zombicide vagy Dead of Winter, azok után sok újat nem nyújtott.

Rating based on following the development of the rulebook.

If it ever sees fruition I can see my rating increasing considerably.

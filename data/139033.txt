Enjoyed this game the first time I played it which led me to get my own. Tough to do. It was purchased as a Kickstarter Add-On for some more Among The Stars stuff.
Love the clockwork/marionette art. This game like more than most of its kind there is never enough resources, gold, or workers to do half of what you want.

The combination of card-play and worker placement is nice. Great idea to teach your standard workers new abilities. Simple rules with deep strategic decisions. Played best with full 4 players for sure. The game gets really tight in this constellation.

Had our first game and I truly enjoyed it. Somehow I feel that the buildings are more crucial and look forward to more buildings released that would give a different flavor to the game.

Apparently made the mistake where you can actually purchase buildings from the 2nd and 3rd era. Thought you are limited to those in the 1st era for the first 3 rounds.

First Play: The rules proved quite straightforward with a need to clarify only one or two points on the geek.

Four players and explaining was around 30-40 minutes. What I hadn't anticipated was the need to chain actions for a main strategy per round. All players were the same some some turns took a while. With hindsight its essential to ensure a back up plan in case another player steals your move. The use of Clerics seem essential.

The game progression is good, the allocation of professions to worker placement is new and very good, however the general play seemed a little dry. All players said they wanted to play again but no one was gushing about it.

While not revolutionary in any way, Archon is a gorgeous worker-placement game with a slight twist that allows you to upgrade & customize your workers. There is a light deck-building component, and has a collective defense mechanic similar to that of Kingsburg.

An enjoyable mid weight worker placement Eurogame that utilizes cards to play your workers on to the board. The new twist is that the cards can be upgraded to make the worker actions more effective. So while you are trying to get your engine going, not upgrading your cards will diminish your play on the board. 

The game is tight and tense with actions that you want to take at a dearth.

I had some difficulty trying to make out the color of some of the resources printed on the board, but after a few rounds it started to come together for me. Other than that, I found the art, components and gameplay satisfying. What initially felt overwhelming, quickly became standard Euro fare.

 Good for gamers, but played it with non gamers with everyone enjoying the game.

It has some nice ideas, but the game is very repetitive.

You do the same things all over again during 3 "years".
Yuou improve your deck to get better things out of actions, but the actions are still the same. Get money, get cubes and trade them for things, some of them you will lose at the end of the year and on the next year (3 rounds) you will get them again doing the same things.

WAAAAAAAYYYY too long for what it offers. A WP that is not dissimilar to hundreds of others out there. Wash rinse repeat.

As for variable worker power...Argent does it much better.

Esthetically, the board is way too big and busy. And the choice of black/grey/white/natural as both player colour and resource cubes is just plain awful. The graphics often confused the black and the grey. Inexcusable.

RATING: 7.5
A good, run-of-the-mill worker placement game that wouldn't deserve much notice if it weren't for the special powers the game introduces. Using cards to denote worker powers is a very clever, and works wonderfully because you have to make some crucial timing decisions while thinking two rounds at a time (and planning several rounds in advance).

We weren't crazy about the turn order mechanic, where whoever has the most actions left at the end of the round becomes the new first player. This forces the person in last place to make a sacrifice, with nothing to gain from it (unlike other games where turn order comes with a slight benefit, the minor improvement in Agricola, for example). This means the person in first place, who already has a significant advantage, is able to maximize his turn at the same time other players lose actions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pretty standard worker placement game where you have all sorts of things to do, but not enough guys to get it all done.

The twist here is that you can upgrade workers from just plain workers into workers that have special abilities.  So, some of your workers might be able to use a space that is already taken, or tax people that use a building after you, etc.

There's also a lot of fuss about the colors, but I didn't find it to be a big deal.  I guess it could be more clear, but no one in our game had any issues.  From all the griping about it, I went into the game thinking it was going to be a big deal or something.

Overall, a solid worker placement game, but nothing incredibly new or innovative that would cause me to play it over others.

After one play, I love it.  The blending of worker placement and deck building just hits my sweet spot and it really works.  I love how your deck remains at 10 cards so you keep cycling your deck and see how the cards play out (a weakness of MageKnight for me).  I like how the upgraded cards affect the game and I like how start player is determined.  I also like the different point scoring paths.  I hope after repeat plays the scoring paths remain balanced and a dominant strategy doesn't emerge, but I'm more than willing to play to find out.

Fun worker placement game. The use of cards (magisters) when placing a worker adds an extra dimension to this game over other worker placement games.

Behind the gorgeous artwork and the overly-designed board there lies an average worker placement game with a slow deckbuilding twist.  It's all very smooth and competent, but with so many similar games out there, there's not a lot to recommend this over any other.

With four players, the gameplay really drags.

Some very interesting twists on worker placement in this game but I'm unsure how they fully hang together. We did make two small/important rule mistakes (if you use a magistrate on a "2 card space", you need to play only one; and the building that allows a merchant to be a tax collector as well goes both ways) which would have changed the dynamics. 
Need to explore this more, but it stayed with me so that's always a good sign. Want to try it again soon.

2016-01-03 : post-game discussion : "I didn't like X" - "But you loved X in game Y" - repeat half a dozen times for various X and Y. You really don't build an engine that can do clever things, the colors are too garish, the board is too busy, the actions are too insignificant, the 45 actions you have in a game are too many, first player is too powerful and too punishing to acquire, ...
I just can't put my finger on the main culprit, there's too many of them. Sometimes a game is greater than the sum of its parts, here it's the opposite.

Worker placement game with three majority scoring components: Warriors, Scientists and Artists.

You can upgrade your standard grey Courtiers to colourful Magisters who give more power to your actions and additional points.

There's a mix of building tiles that support your strategies and yield even more points.

The artwork is amazing, but the production of the goods cards and cube printing on the board is awkward. Grey or Black? Or maybe white?

I find the game itself very enjoyable, a solid 8.

Érdekes, hogy a szabályt olvasva kicsit 12 egy tucat uncsi workerplacementnek gondoltam. Egyetlen csavar van csak benne, hogy a lerakott munkásokat 4 különböző szereppel ruházhatjuk fel a lerakás pillanatában, ami kihat a működésükre, sőt esetleg a többiek következő köreire is.
Az első játék alapján ez pont elegendő ahhoz, hogy ne legyen egy tucat játék. Nagyon élvezetes volt 2 fővel is, de persze még ki kell próbálni több játékossal is. A grafika lenyűgöző, bár praktikus szempontok miatt néhol hátrányos is kicsit.

8

Fúú, 4-en is nagyon jól működött, bár sajnos a többieknek annyira nem jött be, mint nekem. Ahogy az várható volt négyen már sokkal több az interakció, néhol már-már majdnem káoszba megy a dolog, de azért mindig van választható opció, ami előrébb visz. Néhol kicsit bizonyos épületek túl erősnek tűntek, de ezt leszámítva ez egy igen jól kiegyensúlyozott játék, ami pont csak annyira más, mint a többi worker placement, hogy egyedi legyen, de még megmaradjon az eredeti mechanizmus szépsége. Egy hátránya volt négyen, hogy a játékidő nagyon elhúzódott. Úgy tűnik,  hogy reálisa, 30 perc / fővel kell számolni.

RATING: 7.5
The central mechanism of building a deck of workers in a worker placement game is fantastic. It completely makes the game and renders all of its flaws to the sideline.

The rest of the game needs a little polish.

Two of the four highest level buildings simply give you points for having them. There are only four - feels like somebody ran out of ideas.

These buildings are also a good opportunity to inform players of a strategy (or a long term target) that I think has been missed in the design. Possibly could be a couple more of them. I think Tzolk'in is a good example of these types of buildings done a lot better.

It's hard to grab hold of a strategy in general; generally I feel like doing one of everything gets me a decent amount of points. Specializing gives diminishing returns (due to the fact that a lot of points are scored based on being first, second or third and don't relate to the magnitude of the items you collected).

Additionally, the visual design is poor. The board colour should have been changed, notwithstanding Kickstarter backers complaints. If you're the experts and you're the ones playtesting with colours that you know aren't good enough, you need to make the decision to change them.

The player colours shouldn't be the same as the resource colours and all should be more differentiable on the board, cards and tokens themselves. No point designing for colour blindness if your design is this broken as a result.

Others I have played with found the board busy and there was initially some grey/black and cream/white confusion, though I was pretty much immune to both.  Artwork is fantastic!  I really like the game-play.  Improving the workers in a worker placement game was a lot of fun to see how everyone tried different specialists.

Some games let you ignore the victory point scoring until the very end of the game, which I like because I can forget what was scored and what wasn't.   This game makes you keep track as you go so that you don't miss the events that let you score points, which you otherwise cannot track with the game components.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Card-driven worker-placement with some deck building. The only possibly unique thing is the automatic removal of one of your common cards when you acquire a magistrate, so that your deck size never changes. I'm just not sure the four types of magistrate are balanced, with merchants seeming much better than the others.

Otherwise, the game is fine, but it takes too long and never really shines. Even its less common features, like using cards to place workers or the mix of action selection with deck building, also appear in better games, such as "Asgard" and "Rococo". And the actions you take are pretty standard fare: gain resources, buy and sell them, spend them to buy cards or buildings with special powers cards.

The artwork is beautiful and the illustrator has a very personal style, but the board looks very busy, with everything blending together and making it hard to read, even with the good iconography. Another problem is the terrible choice of colors for resources and players' pieces (black, gray, white and natural wood for both), prone to cause confusion.

A medium weight worker placement that is pleasant to play.  Element of a deck builder (but your deck is always limited to 10 cards and new cards are one of four types).  Very tight victory point scramble although there are certain tiles which go a long way to ensuring victory.

The graphic design of this game is horrifyingly poor.  An extremely large busy board with a great deal of wasted space, resource & player colours which are close to identical, vicious colour contrast that makes it hard to read the board.  The production designer should be beaten, then sent off to design school to learn how it should be done properly.

Good game buried under absurdly lavish artwork.  The board should be cut to 1/3 of the current size, graphics simplified and standarized (e.g. all characters of one type should have the same art).

Then a gem would be exposed - the game with really solid mechanics, being a mix of fresh and proven ideas.  HIGH interaction meets creating your own engine (build buidlings, hire new people (to replace the starting ones)) and it works together surprisingly well.

Still, I won't be buying it.  I don't know what is to blame (art, feeling the game is a bit longish or the fear of repetitiveness in the long run), but never mind.  I recommend you to try it at least once.  It might be up your alley.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (March 2017)

I didn’t know what to expect from Archon: Glory & Machination but I wasn’t expecting much from it. On one hand it was funded through Kickstarter, and that always make new games a little bit uncertain in my book, on the other hand it was published by Artipia Games, a publisher that is very miss with me. After playing it, I can say it was better than expected, but still just an ok game for me.

Archon: Glory & Machination is a worker placement game that goes for nine round, perhaps it is a bit long for what it offers. 

The rules aren’t very complex, but there are a lot of things to explain. You can do it under 20 minutes. 

I really like the art of the game and I also think the graphic design of the board works well. Some friends think the board was too heavy with color, but that’s fine for me. Having said that, I think there were some unfortunate decisions when picking the color of certain things. For example, the game´s resources are the exact same color of the player´s pieces, some of the colors on the cards look different than the real item they depict, two of the colors are easily confused between them and for games with 2 or 3 players they also chose a color that appears in the cards, so at the beginning I thought only those cards could be used in those spots and that’s not the case. To summarize, I don’t know who approved the colors of the board and pieces, but they did a terrible, terrible job. 

The theme is cool, but you don’t feel it though the game.

Archon: Glory & Machination offers some interesting and non-obvious decisions with very low luck (a plus for me). There are lots of options to consider each turn, but as you play you realize that the game seemed more heavy and complex that it really is. The novelty here, is that you can upgrade your workers into 4 different more powerful workers.

At the beginning of each odd turn, you take all your ten cards and you distribute them in two five cards piles. You can put any card in any pile but you will us eon pile in this turn and one in the next after this one, that is, this mechanism allows you to plan for the next two turns, this is a feature I haven’t seen I any game before it and I like it.

Best with 3 players

I should love the game, but for some reason, I don’t. It has low tension, furthermore when you get the blue cards. Perhaps that’s my issue with the game. In most worker placement games when a player takes a spot you cannot take it, but here you can. I didn’t have much fun playing it but the game has potential.

Bottom line, Archon: Glory & Machination is much better than I initially expected, it has interesting and meaty decisions and offers a novel way of hand management, still, my desire to play the game is rather low. Perhaps it is too long for what it offers. The component’s colors are very bad and confuse players easily. I´m going to sell my copy of the game, but I would play again if requested. The art is very good.

This game pushed all the wrong buttons.
The components are an utter disaster regarding usability. The board is so busy that you're repeatedly searching the spots where to place your meeples to choose an action. The resources come in the colours white, beige, grey and black. The white and the beige cubes are almost indistinguishable. The representations of the resource colours on the board don't correspond to the cubes at all.
Mechanistically, the game is a hodgepodge of deckbuilding, majority scoring and worker placement. In itself, that's not necessarily a bad thing. Rokoko does exactly the same mix in an enjoyable fashion. While Rokoko doesn't introduce anything new, it mixes known elements in a way where the sum of the elements is more than its parts. Here's where Archon falls miles short. Each element has been done better somewhere else. The deckbuilding feels awkward, the majorities to fight for are bland and one-dimensional. The result is an annoying lacklustre affair that left me angry for wasting my time with this completely superfluous effort instead of a more rewarding game. Archon is another proof that Kickstarter opens up alleys for bad or mediocre games to reach the market that would have needed a competent developer. Artipia Games still is miles away from established publishers that have built up this competency over many years.

Nagyon tetszik a megjelenése, egyedi és szép a grafika, ugyanakkor kicsit zavaró is, a tábla elsőre nem túl átlátható. Mechanikailag minden rendben van, jó ötletek vannak benne, de az az igazság, hogy semmi extrát nem éreztem benne. Persze nem is feltétlenül kell valami igazán egyedi elem, mert egy igazán jó társas lett ez így, csak nem érzem, hogy miért ezt választanám 10-20 másik helyett. Ez valószínűleg inkább az én "kiégésem" csak, jó eséllyel nem játszom már ezzel újra.

Preliminary rating of 7 based on one 2p play with a difficult opponent. It's worker placement with a twist, which is all too common these days, but the twist is interesting. Cards allow you to modify your workers and spots allow you to modify your deck in a simplistic, slow deckbuilding sort of way. These trappings surround a game that is basically simple majority scoring with typical buildings-that-bend-the-rules that you can buy, plus GoT-style the-raiders-are-coming. It was enjoyable and I'd like to try it again with 3p or 4p.

There was an interesting deck building/worker placement mechanism in this game, but ultimately titles from this publisher always seem to be Frankenstein-esque.  Lots of mechanics all bolted onto a game do not a good design make.  And the artwork, while interesting, obfuscates gameplay.  Away it went!

Great quality components. People complains about the board; it is large and full of things, but I didn't find that to be a problem; I got used to it in a few minutes. What I found it more annoying is the cube colours; they are very similar.

It is a sound worker placement games with a few different paths to victory. The game is very well designed, except, maybe, a couple of buildings that could be overpowered. Still, there doesn't seem to be a dominant strategy.

The star feature is the worker improvement mechanism (it reminded me of Belfort, but I like this implementation more). Appart from that, the rest is pretty standard.

My main complains about this game are its excessive lenght for its depth and the lack of variable elements to provide different challenges. Players will tend to repeat their approach to the game, especially the worker selection.

Malgrado il tabellone molto ricco di informazioni, e apparentemente confuso, trovo la grafica del gioco fantastica e mi vien voglia di giocarlo e rigiocarlo. Il gioco si presente in maniera tutto sommato elegante con diversi spunti interessanti. Quasi nullo il caso è un gioco di programmazione attenta. Buona interazione e necessità di pianificare una strategia. Molte sono le strategie percorribili. Trovo comunque imprescindibili gli edifici da acquistare. Specie quelli che forniscono rendita all'inizio di ogni turno.

First play, a 2 player game, the game went smoothly and fast, not too much problem with the huge beautiful board and the immense colors and components.

2nd play, a 4 player game: well the game tends to be thicker and some visual confusion arose with the colors, the board tends to be obviously more busy.

I have mixed feelings about the chromatic choices. the board is beautiful, but there were some complaints about the colors of the players and the confusion with the resources, and sometimes the colors on the board lead to confusion, the neutral with with the white and the grey with black (more than once, on the space for the elite warriors, there was confusion between grey and black).

I think after the first couple of games one can get used to this visual information overload, because the game is quite easy to grasp and the initial mess clears away, and the card playing/deck building/hand management/worker placement is really cool.

RATING: 7.5
I think I must be an exception: I had heard some bad things about this game before playing (Fré totally demolished this game in his review and for Ellen it was also only OK) and after our 1 play I was the only player who had a good feeling about this game.

That there is nothing really new concerning game mechanics in this game, that I can agree with (mini-deckbuilding was clearly THE mechanic of Essen 2013, as after Rokoko and Concordia, this already the 3rd game that uses this). 
The critic that turn order is really important and it's stupid to sacrifice an action (= a card) for it, I completely don't agree with. I did it a few times when I felt I was too high in turn order and by becoming first I could grab the best spots first, so by renouncing 1 action in 1 round, my actions in the next ones were far more efficient, so it was well worth sacrificing that 1 card.

I like how everything works together and how you can personalize your deck by going for certain colours of Magisters. It's a game where you have to play in an opportunistic way (something I like doing), by whom I mean: If you have the resources for taking by example science, and the spot is available, then just buy science, as your certain it will give you points at the end of the season. 
If you have the plan in your head to take all the necessary resources for gatekeepers and converting those resources into gatekeepers all in the same round, then you'll probably end up frustrated, as especially with 4 there's bound to be someone getting into your way on at least 1 spot you need (but off course The Clerics (= blue Magister) can help you with that :)). 

So for me a game I'm glad having in my collection. Now have to find some players who also like this game :s

Worker Placement with different worker abilities. The board looks gorgeous and terrifyingly complex looking, but really isn't. Sadly the game suffers from a bad case of poor color choices. Nude, white, black, and gray blocks is a terrible idea for different resources. I feel because of this that it detracts from the quality of the game.

Solid worker placement game tarnished by bad graphic design/color choices.

Wow this game is beautiful. Well, the artwork on the cards anyway. The actual player pieces and resources are not ideal. I really actually hated the player colors. The board looks to be scary and uninviting but in reality there is not a lot of actions you can really do. The life of the game doesn't ramp up in anyway and it felt very linear. I would try it again, but, it lasted a bit longer than I would want and I felt only OKay during game play. I would play again just to take better photos, mostly.

This is a wonderful worker placement game plagued by some of the worst graphic design choices I have ever seen. In our first game, we played the first two rounds thinking the spot on the board that produced soldiers needed black cubes when in fact in round three we realized that it needed grey cubes. That's right, the cube colors in this game are black, grey, wooden, tan and white. The same colors are used for the players, although the resources are not tied to the players at all. The board is about two leafs too large for the amount of actual things on it. The action spots are also blended into the white streets of the board making actual gameplay related things hard to easily see when you are sitting on the opposite end of the table.

All that being said, the game is still a really fantastic and enjoyable worker placement game. When you place a worker you use a card along with that worker, and the card can give that worker a special ability in a really simple and pleasant deck-building way. You always have the same number of cards in a round, so rather than having a family growth system, this game just has you upgrade your workers so your array of cards slowly gets better. The game also requires you to plan a full turn ahead, as every other round you chose 5 cards to use the next round, and then the other 5 in the following round. Points come from defending the castle, constructing buildings which help your engine, upgrading your cards or buying science and art cards that do nothing other than score at the end of the round. You really never feel like you have enough actions.

If you have the chance to play this game, and you can get past all the terrible terrible graphic design choices, this is a game you should play. What we did for game 2 that helped a ton, was whenever on the board we saw a picture of the grey (silver) cube, we put an ore token on it from the stonemaiergames resource set, and we replaced just the grey cubes with matching tokens. It made everything so much smoother.

I backed this game on kickstarter, thinking it sounded like an interesting worker placement game due to its card-driven gameplay, determining what abilities yor workers add. However, on my first play - a 3p game back in January 2014 - I was really quite disappointed with the game. Not that there was anything wrong with it, and certainly there were plenty of non-obvious decisions, but nothing in the mechanics particularly grabbed me either. And the graphic design choices are probably the worst I've ever seen in a game - why are the four player colours the same as the four resource colours, and why are these colours the not-exactly-colourful black, silver, brown and beige? And that's before we even get into the fact that the white and beige cubes are very hard to distinguish, while the pictures of the black and silver cubes on the board - crucial to understanding what action spaces actually do and what resources are available - are nigh-on indistinguishable.

I played my second - and still last, so far - game in August 2014, 2p against my wife. I enjoyed this more than the first game, despite not generally enjoying this type of game with just 2, but it still didn't make it into a game which would ever be a first choice.

It's a good solid game, but one which doesn't really offer anything unique to differentiate it from hundreds of other worker placement game, and with the awful graphic issues on top, I have to say that backing this was ultimately a waste of money.

RATING: 4
Embodies all that is bad about contemporary game design. All kinds of mechanics that have no rhyme or reason. The board is an absolute graphic design mess. At least a dozen times in our game people played things in the wrong place because you get no help as a player from the cluttered and logic-free board. No reason why you are doing anything except to get points. No thematic or other sense of why things are powered the way they are. Just thinking about it gives me the shivers. Truly a wasted 3 and a half hours.

Decent worker placement game with basically no randomness. Another two interesting aspects are the hand management in which you always have exactly 10 workers, but can replace the basic types with more advanced ones over time; as well as the multiplayer prisoner dilemma concerning the guarding of the walls.

The graphics appear a bit convoluted at first, but actually are very clear once someone has explained them. If, oh if, there wasn't that horrible choice of primary resource colours, which are black, blackish, dark white and white. Especially black and blackish are basically indistinguishable on the board.

Still, I was determined to take home at least one "large" game from Essen, and this was one out of three on the final list of possible choices.

Pretty good worker placement game. The novel mechanic here is obtaining the magistrate cards, which affect the actions that you can take. There's a bit of tension in whether or not to go in the one-card vs. two-card slots, and certainly the competition is fierce to win the top rank in the art cards or getting warriors on the wall. The buildings provide some nice goals to obtain. Still, is a bit long for what it is, which draws its rating down a little bit. Also, while I do appreciate the attempt for ornate art, the board is very busy to the point of being almost distracting.

This is kind of a straightforward worker placement game with a very small role selection aspect to it.  Each placement area on the board requires a player to also play one or two cards form their hand.  There are courtiers and magisters and magisters can count as 2 cards for the purpose of those spaces that require 2 cards as well as confer a small bonus.  Past that the game is simply collecting resources and using them to score points in different ways.  The biggest variation the game provides is in the different buildings you can obtain to get various different bonuses.

It is a solid game but doesn't really break the mold compared to many other fantastic worker placement games in a very crowded market.  The role selection is kind of interesting and offers another layer of choices but not enough to make it feel like much more than standard worker placement fare.

My one play of this game was with just 2 players and I'm interested to see how the maximum of 4 plays.  I'm curious to see if it comes alive at that number as there will be more competition for certain spaces, buildings, player order, and just more competition in general.  With just two the game was a much more casual jaunt with very little getting in each other's way and turn order especially didn't change the whole game because taking more actions was always better than going first the following turn.

Also, yes, the board is extremely cluttered and hard to navigate at first but after just a couple rounds you know where everything is and the noise on the board kind of melts away.  The art on the magister and courtier cards themselves is very pretty and stylish in this clockwork world Artipia has created for this and their Shadows over the Empire game.  Even though all the courtiers and magisters of a given type do the same thing they have several different pieces of artwork on them which is a nice little touch.  The other player in my first game would even go through the deck to find his favorites when hiring new magisters.

I like Artipia's graphic style. It usually results in overly busy game boards and components, but I have found it rarely gets in the way when actually playing.
This is a very straightforward worker placement/resource gathering game with some nice twists. Using the upgraded action cards, you can occupy a space that is already occupied or force other people to pay you to do the same action.
You can also build buildings which will help you be more flexible or efficient or score more points.
It all goes along at a decent speed, the rules are not too complex and there are some good choices to be made. But it failed to provide me any fun. It's all very dry and mechanical. That's not something that bothers me in and of itself, but this game just didn't excite me.

RATING: 8
Like any heavy euro, there's definitely a learning curve and it takes a while to sort out what everything is and does, but once you've got it, I really like all the choices and how things play out. There seem to be many viable strategies to winning. The art is phenomenal. My only gripe is with the color on the cubes and representations on the cards. It's really difficult to differentiate between grey and black on the printed material and between natural and white on the actual cubes. I'll likely try and get replacement player pieces in regular differentiable colors and give the white cubes another coat of white.

Beautiful art and still on the good side of brain burning WP optimalization. 

Only thing to bring the rating down is the fact that the building strategy is too strong compared to the King strategy.

Worker placement distilled down to its essence. A tremendous amount of choices to makes and places to go. Very heavy. It also has gorgeous, and I mean GORGEOUS artwork. The board is way overboard, however, and it made everyone stop and look and say, "Whoa, what is all that? How can you even tell what is going on?". It has a really fantastic card mechanism as well. But the game is very stressful. Every move feels momentous. Need to play again; on the fence. We also didn't finish our game because of store closing. I was in the lead but that was sure to change.

The outstanding art is what made me want to buy this game, but mechanisms made it stay in my collection. (edit: until a few other games and a tight budget pushed it out)
The board might seem chaotic at first, but by the end of the first or second round, you won't mind it at all. Although it is definetly too big, but with a big enough table that doesn't matter.

Lovely artwork and a great game, woefully marred by dumbass choices of meeple colors.  Resource cubes that are the same as the player colors.  Everything is black and white with shades of gray.  WTF were they thinking?  So if I were to rate the game on combined art, gameplay, and components, the 5 is for the game play and art.  Components get some number below zero.  Combined with how long it took to get the game being a KS backer, and considering it was released at Essen, makes this the worst kickstarter I backed in 2013.  It's more sad than frustrating.  Artipia should make things right for this game and fix the components.

A very good worker placement game in an era of overabundant games in the genre.  It is good and possibly worth owning, but only if you can stomach the very loud artwork.

The artwork for this game is stunning, though it definitely has some flaws, such as the lack of sufficient distinction between the colors of the gray and black resource cubes. With all the different options for Magister cards, it gives the players a lot to think about every turn. It is ridiculously huge, though, with the piles of components leading to extensive time spent on setup. That's going to lead to reduced opportunity for play, since I can't easily carry it around to gaming meetups; even if I did, the tables wouldn't be big enough for the board.

I don't see enough to set it apart from all my other send workers to get stuff to build things to earn victory points games.

playtested twice

a lot of things have changed since then.
Its not the game that you are going to say wow 
but its a good euro game with a lot of depth and many strategies to use.
It stands good for 2 player also.(you have to adapt some rules first)

I want to play it again to see whats the final result and how much it has changed.

good to burn your brain

cons: too long game, doesnt work with 2, excellent with 4, maybe unbalanced with 3 if one player is left uncompete for his strategy.

A 9 for gameplay.  A 6 for production choices. 

Luckily the production choices are easily fixed and more weight is on excellent game play, rating 8 after two games.  Best with 3.

Összességében egy jó játék, de vmiért nem hiszem, h túl sokszor elő fog még kerülni. Van egy pár kifejezetten jó mechanika benne (kártyák cseréje-gyűjtése), de a jobbnál jobb workerplacement játékokból túltengés van, így nem fér be a listába. Amit még kiemelnék és nagy mínusz, hogy - főleg - a nyersanyagszínek nagyon zavaróak, és bár jó az ikonozás, ez sok helyen azért megzavarja a játékélményt.

GAME: Ascension: Deckbuilding Game
RANK: 497
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I'd like to trade the whole shebang - two base sets (Chronicle and Storm of Souls), two expansions (Return of the Fallen and Immortal Heroes), and numerous promos - as one unit. Cards are all sleeved in Fantasy Flight premium sleeves and stored in the two big base set boxes; the two expansion set boxes are missing (likely discarded). I can include the sleeves or not in the trade; the cards have not been played unsleeved, but sleeves add somewwhat to the monetary value of the collection as well as some weight for shipping.

Les strategic than Dominion and is simpler but flows much better than Thunderstone. Not sure how this one will be expanded because adding more cards will simply dilute a deck that is already rather hard to attain specific combinations

No, seriously, Dominion is a much better game but this is a nice one when you want something different that sets-up in 1 minute.

RATING: 9
Fun, light deckbuilding goodness. The more expansions you add the better the game gets. Tons of combos within each of the card factions give great replayability. Because of the changing card row the game is much more tactical than strategic, and because of this the game can change greatly from turn to turn. However this game gets bonus points from me because it can be played in a light and non-brain burning fashion.

Deck building game very similar to MTG without PvP combat.

Did not like as there is not much player interaction, and tends to be focused on numbers instead, and few ways to mess up your opponent.

Played only on iOS (MANY) times, and it's fine for a quick light deck builder but I would probably never play this in card format.  The theme is garbage, the art is terrible, and the game play is fine but not as good as other deck builders.

Now that Marvel Legendary is out, there is no reason to play Ascension.  It's an improvement in every way!

Incredibly like Dominion (I mean is 10 cards somehow the optimal cards to start with? And 5 cards in your hand?), but with a nifty vibe. The quick set up is a huge plus and the duel resources make for some interesting lanes of strategy. But for all that, it feels weak and lacks interesting card combination. It flares fast and dies. Not a lasting game experience here. Sold it.

*Rating based on playing the iOS app.

When I first saw a review of Ascension, I was unimpressed.  I didn't like the art at all, and the gameplay seemed simplistic and shallow.  Eventually I picked up the game for the iOS and found I really enjoyed it.  I've since played hundreds of times.  Ascension is a great app, but I'm less enthralled with it as a tabletop game (in which format I've only played it once).  It's not bad in cardboard form, but it's just so much quicker and easier in digital format, and doesn't lose anything in that transition that other tabletop games do.

The game system is solid and the Realms Unraveled expansion really takes it from being a good game to being a great game, but when it comes to game night, I just don't see this game hitting the table much.  I'll just stick to playing it on my phone when I have a few minutes to kill.

App version: App version is pretty fun as a solo (vs ai) deckbuilding experience. Physical version is terrible. Worse than dominion with the same problems: luck based on good draws which snowballs into someone buying a lot of draw cards then having to wait for them to draw half their deck every turn. App version has the AI take almost instant turns so its not a problem here.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Multiplayer: The obvious problems are that the game doesn't last long enough for the cards to have much meaning beyond their VP, and that the game fails if all the central cards are predominately of one type or the other, a situation which may well last for a significant number of player-turns. Our first game was a bit of a joke as the great majority of the monsters never entered play. Some expensive cards are likely to be near-useless, except for their high VP.

It appears to work well two-player, but not otherwise.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Massively underwhelmed by this. The idea has potential, and I think in general, the VP dynamics are alright, but the cards are massively unbalanced (find a culler? Yay!) and the gameplay makes any sort of strategy haphazard at best.

Another game that I consistently win against the Other Player. But somehow I think this time I earned it (sorry, mate!).

I love Ascension. Ascension seems like the perfect answer to everything I dislike about Magic: the Gathering. Which is mainly the price and the sheer endlessness of the game. Nothing wrong about the people playing it (cheers, mate!). 

However, whoever created this game was obviously insane. This whole Energy-thing is fun, but from a scientific perspective it is completely mad. Imagine the concept in real life - just because you have enough energy to power your computer, it means you can recycle the energy to also run the fridge and the heater and of course your toy helicopter (don't ask). That's just ... not how physics works. Who comes up with this madnesss? Even in your average fantasy novel people drain their mana/chi/mindpower/whatever sources. Stuff gets used up. Entropy increases. Does nobody proofread (proof...play?) games anymore?

Then again, it's so much fun to fire up you fifth construct and completely destroy everything on your enemies side of the table ... what do I care about thermodynamics?

+ Fast play-time; Good variety of cards and abilities.
- Has a better, quicker, easier, identical version of the game on the iOS; Why pull out the real version?


Why it's previously-owned:
There were always better 2 player games to go for instead of this one, especially since I can play this (without all of the shuffling) on my iPod.
I traded this away along with For Sale in order to get London.  Martin Wallace has put out a few games that I really enjoy, so I'm expecting that London will be a good fit as well.

RATING: 7
Deckbuilder with a center row of cards that are available for any player to purchase on their turn.  Due to that, it's a bit swingy, but I like it more than Dominion.  Strategy and tactics can change during the game, responding to the cards that come out, which I like.

Due to it needing expansions to stay fresh, I'm not willing to buy into a whole lot of them, so I don't need to own, but I would gladly play again.

Feels like a quick answer to Dominion, in terms of deck-building games to follow.  It's like the slew of CCG games that came out in answer to Magic, like Wyvern or something.  No depth, little strategy.

The aesthetics were a pleasant surprise; the art is unique, the crystals are a nice touch, and I've got a soft spot for the dark slant of early second millennium Christianity. Clearly this was a slick iOS production, but it was also a game that looked good on the table, with largish print and a consistent vibe. 

Mechanically, there isn't much to do. Essentially, you're trying to manage how much time you have to escalate your rune count against the need to be able to destroy monsters that clog the row. Unfortunately, the six-card centre row is too random to be able to plan accurately. 

The iOS application made this accessible and even addictive, and I wrote a few strategy articles after several hundred plays: [thread=687646][/thread] and [thread=683177][/thread]. Still, once you understand the set, decisions are mostly automatic, with early deck-thinning great (as usual) and most games between experienced players becoming a crapshoot. Fun for a while, but given how expandable the game has become, difficult to find opponents for the first set, which was lean and quick enough to make it worthwhile for a few months of play. 

Overall, I just don't enjoy the amount of variance in deckbuilding games -particularly this or something like [thing=147020][/thing]. The shuffle creates randomness, but it also feels pointless. Also, this is strictly a 2er game. 

I'D RATHER WE PLAYED: [thing=43022][/thing]. A bit of a lateral comparison, but the choices are meaningful and explicable as a quanitifiable risk. In games like Ascension, you learn the set and then you hope your cards come up.

Played this one out in a week with 10 plays on my honeymoon.  It was pretty interesting during those plays, but after that, the 2-3 viable strategies were revealed and the game became stale.  Definitely worth the money to rent or buy for those initial 10 plays, but I would recommend just playing someone else's copy a few times for the experience.

This is a more tactical version of Dominion, but the strategy is completely removed.  Only a couple ways to build up your deck, and from there on, you are just reacting to the cards that have arrived on the table at any given time.  (this leads to moderate luck element involved as well)

The artwork is singularly uninteresting, each turn feels exactly the same as the last and the choices aren't terribly interesting.  Also I fear that future games will be very much the same as the first.  I will probably play it again to confirm these initial feelings, but I doubt I'll be surprised.

:arrowE: [u]Synopsis[/u]:
A deck-building game with a central market row. Start with five cards, play some, get some, discard. Repeat. Yes, this form of deck-building has effectively become a board game trope, but Ascension grabbed it by the horns and just turned the dial to Spinal Tap levels of 11. Played with more than three players (but really, played with more than [i]two [/i]players) it becomes swingy and overly luck-based (so yes, I'll agree with you there, Dominion purists), but with two players it is a very tight, high-agency battle for supremacy, both tactical and strategic.

:arrowE: [u]What I like most[/u]:
So what does Ascension offer over other deck-building games? [b]WOMBO COMBO.[/b] This game more than any like it allows for the setup of absolutely absurd combo plays, with cards triggering cards triggering cards triggering cards for huge gains in economy, card draw, and scoring. My favorite aspect of this is the "multi-unite" feature of many cards, in which a card of one type has a bonus effect by itself, then you get to repeat the bonus effect if another card of a like type is played (even retroactively!). It is not unlike the gif below, if the first card played (which starts a multi-unite domino effect) is Samus, your opponent is the gray Starfox, and the other cards of your deck (which continue to trigger the multi-unite domino effect and add new multi-unite effects of their own) are the green Starfox:

[img]https://media.giphy.com/media/mRbXaJKWlb1SM/giphy.gif[/img]
In two player games, "honor" (aka POINTS) are capped at sixty, but this total can be exceeded if a single turn warrants pushing that envelope (depleting the stated honor pool triggers the end of the game at the close of that round). Here is a great example:

[imageid=3280877 medium] 
[imageid=3493274 medium]
What's that clot of barely-distinguishable rectangles in the bottom half of the top image? Those are all of the cards I played in that SINGLE turn. Remember how I said you start each turn by drawing only five cards? Right. Wombo Combo, indeed.

I like every other deck-building game less for each session of Ascension I play.

:arrowE: [u]What I like least[/u]:
Certain card interactions can be diluted if you blend lots of expansions or card sets together. This can also increase the swingyness of some games as one player may acquire the only few cards that combo together, while the other player is left with strong but uninteractive one-offs. 

As an added note, yes, the majority of my plays are digital, but I do play the physical game quite often. The accounting of aforementioned combo breaking gets a bit difficult in the analog version, so there's that.

[hr]
11/16/17 EDIT: I moved the rating down from 10 to 8 primarily because I basically only play this via app. While it is my favorite deck-builder, no question, it's unfair (in my opinion) to rank this "10" when I don't really play it as a board game any longer.

Rating after 1 game.  A Dominion style of clone but with loads less strategy apparent at the outset.  What I didn't like was the churn of the cards.  Made it feel like there weren't any meaningful decisions.  Would try again but first impression was not a good one.

One of the most overrated games in my collection in my opinion. While I appreciate the notion of a deckbuilder with virtually no setup time this game just does not have enough going on in it for me.

An interesting Dominion variant that has been negatively reviewed by many for what it is not.

Hardcore gamers who want a deep, totally balanced game might want to steer clear of this one.

That said, my partner and I love this game for what it is.

It is:
- a really quick deck building game that allows you to scratch the itch in a short amount of time
- a really simple game to teach to casual and non gamers
- a game with a moderate amount of randomness / luck, which allows less experienced gamers a chance to do well and even win against a more experienced player.

Some issues
- the art: some people hate it. I don't love it, but it has grown on me after awhile. At the least I think most people will find it tolerable.
- card variety: there is indeed a limited variety here. With several plays you would have seen them all. The randomness of the draw helps to make this better, but I definitely see the need for new cards to liven things up.

Do your research to see if it fits your bill, and if you head in with the right expectations you may well end up liking it too.

Interesting deck building game, that plays to my inner D&D nerd with its theme. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Yep. We've picked up yet another deck builder. It may be our favorite type of game (possibly tied with worker-placement). The theme is a little bit thin and the artwork is so abstract as to be ugly. It works like your standard deck builder but there is one mechanic we don't care for. To one side is a "cultist" card with only 2 defense that doesn't move from his position that you are allowed to attack should you have nothing else you can attack in the center display. Honestly you could simply hammer away at that guy throughout the game and possibly win just like that. Not to mention this has some of the WORST artwork in board gaming. It's kinda hard to look at really.

Initially fun with the concept of two different currencies (instead of 1 for Dominion).  Unfortunately after just a few plays it becomes fairly repetitive.  Another problem is that the deck is completely random, whereas with Dominion, the card choices are always available.

Ascension: Chronicle of the Godslayer, takes all the faults from its close relative (Dominion), and splurges over them with color and style (something dominion lacks).  While the deck building processes is more random, and more luck based, it tends to be more fun then Dominion, which sometimes runs on an autopilot binary process.  (Which are the type of games I loath)  And since human input is required, your part of the experience, the deck-building type game now feels much more complete.  Even though the artwork isn't universally likable, some may find it intriguing, and at the very least it is unique (unlike Dominion).  What is cooler is the four types of cards, and the themed gameplay mechanic involved with each one.  Also player interaction, although subtle, is present.

Mostly played solitaire as 2 player or against BGG AI.
Also available on Android, played it a few times but like the card version better, even if it takes some more time for setup and administration.
Bought most of the expansions.
I like the special graphic style but I know most peoples don`t like it.

[geekurl=/user/UndeadViking]UndeadViking[/geekurl] hatte mich durch sein gutes Video Review auf dieses Deckbuilding Spiel aufmerksam gemacht [geekurl=/video/4331/ascension-chronicle-of-the-godslayer/avraw-50-ascension-chronicle-of-the-godslayer-n]Ascension [/geekurl].
Ich spiele gerne Thunderstone (auch in der Solovariante).
Ascension ist von der Thematik ähnlich zu Thunderstone hat seine Stärken jedoch besonders durch seinen viel schnelleren Aufbau und dem schnelleren Spiel zu zweit mit begrenzter Spieldauer (bis alle Ehrenkristalle verteilt sind). Das relativ große Spielbrett ist nicht unbedingt notwendig unterstützt aber die Übersicht und die Atmosphäre und gibt dem Spiel ein bisschen Brettspielkarakter (obwohl es natürlich ein Kartenspiel ist).
Im Gegensatz zu Thunderstone hat man eigentlich fast jede Runde etwas zu tun und muss nicht lange aufrüsten bis man endlich mal ein Monster einnorden kann.
Das Spiel hat das Potential häufiger gespielt zu werden als Thunderstone.
Spiele es jedoch vorwiegend solo.
Auch auf Android.

The base game is lacking in a lot of ways.  Is it playable?  Yes.  Can you have fun playing it?  Yes.  Does it beat out Dominion as a deck building game?  Not in the least.  It does achieve Dominion status with some of the expansions added in.  Just wish the base game wasn't so boring.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Tough one to rate, which is probably a good characteristic in a game.  At least it denotes that it's interesting!  LOVED the setup compared to Dominion, but I thought 4P was an exercise in uninterested downtime and feel like it would be trivial for AI or a reasonably competent gamer to play the game extremely well, because of how few decisions one has on their turn.  I was told great things about its 2P playability, which makes sense to me.  I'd give it another go with 3P - not expecting to love it - but 4P is right out and I'd prefer all kinds of stuff to trying it 2P.  As bashed as base Dominion is for me, and as uninterested I am in its expansions or really playing it more, I think it's a far more thought and time-worthy game.  Still haven't played Thunderstone or Puzzle Strike, so I dunno about the clone series in general.

+ Great implementation on iOS. Simple & fast.
- Forget strategy. You might think "I'll go for mechana constructs since I got two" and never see other for the rest of the game. This is purely tactic, and even the tactics are a bit lame. The game can get stalled to a point where you have to buy a bad card only to make one really good available for the opponent. There's a lot of luck involved, here. And the cards look horrible.

Simpler than Dominion, and I don't think that it has as much staying power.  However I like it more than Thunderstone.  There are multiple areas that you can specialize in.  The more points you can spend buying things, the more efficiently you can add end-game points.

I think that this would be fun for playing with kids, and will probably pick it up at some point in time.

RATING: 1
Utterly crap. Terrible idea, atrocious artwork, a complete disaster when introduced to my eager game group. The box and components reek of a horrid stench, and the gameplay (like its art) is awash in blandness.

Only waste your time on this after being lobotomized.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A much more tactical game than Dominion or Thunderstone, with which it otherwise shares a lot of the mechanics. In fact, I feel it may be too much so: you try to get the most with the hand you have and what's available, but there's usually only two or three options to pick from. For a supposedly deck building game, there's so few choices and strategy, you're really just adding cards to your deck rather than building anything: on your turn, you look at your cards, if you have 5 points then you buy card A, otherwise you buy card B. 

Only played once, but for what it's worth the impression I was left with is this is much more luck driven than other similar games; in the end, the game's playing you more than the other way around. All that said, it plays very fast and it's still fun, if somewhat shallow. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I would need to add at least 200 plays to include the number of times that I've played this on my iPhone to really list the amount of play that this one gets. A game that is quick to set up, quick to teach, and quick to play. Works well as a game for my wife and I after a long day at work, or while waiting for another activity. Also, Eric Sabee's art is phenomenal and it just gets better with every set!

Fun fast paced deck builder. It does not have the complexity that Thunderstone has, but it takes about a single minute to set up. To be fair to Ascension, I only have the base game right now and I have everything for Thunderstone so comparing the two is a bit harsh.

Like the differences between the factions, and mixing and mashing them up for a specific end goal is pretty cool. The main deck can feel pretty unforgiving at times. The big take away is that this is a fast paced light deck builder with good clean and concise design. For me, very solid game.

General thoughts on Ascension: I generally like the game, having the right level for complexity for what it is. It's definitely better with a low player count, as with five or six players (which you can play with only by combining two sets) the downtime gets a bit too much and the center line changes too much after your turn to really care about what is there. Combining sets is also problematic, as it make the deck unshufflable. If I were to ever buy a copy of Ascension, I probably get only set and player as a two-player game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The strategic decisions in this game seem pretty limited, and it's mostly luck based. Did good cards come out on your turn or not? Still, something about this game is very appealing, and I've been playing an awful lot of it.

Better two player than with more. I think I prefer Heroes of Graxia over this but it's a fine deck drafting game - feels like there are plenty of architypes to be built from the current card pool but also feels like it's an expansion short of being complete.

Not super keen on the artwork - functional is the best I can offer.

I only played the iOS version of the game, and it is one of the best conversions of a boardgame to an app I ever experienced. Playing deckbuilding games without the annoyance of the reshuffling is indeed better!
Ascension is one of the first Dominion clones to appear on the market, and used a particular twist on the variable set up of the game: the card display is ever-changing!
I like it better than Dominion, but the complete randomness in setting the available cards up is a possible downside: strategy cannot be conceived and one must adapt to what fate offers.
I suspect the iOS version would deserve a 7.5 (the randomness is not a problem in a 5-10 minutes game), but the actual game is a 7 (with the shuffling it cannot last less than 30 min.)...

Update november 9, 2012: the real cardboard game is not so fiddly, so it deserves a 7.5.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
While I do like the card drafting mechanic, the art really put me off. I would play Tanto Cuore, Thunderstone over this any time.

Again, I am not adverse to playing this but when there are so many options, I just cannot see myself playing this other than there are others who want to play this game.

Okay - still a young game - needs an expansion or two to really get the Dominion crowd hooked on this one.
The one problem I keep experiencing is the wave-like tendencies of either beasties (okay, monsters, whatever) showing up on the board. 
In one game I felt quite prepared for that as I had built up power-based constructs and went heavy on the military based cards - I won handily with 83 points - I really didn't need to count the cards because I had such a dominating position with acquired honor points.

As a deckbuilder, Dominion Lite.  It's a fun game, but the randomized pool of available cards makes it hard to implement an actual strategy; your choice often boils down to the best card(s) that you can afford, which may or may not have anything to do with how they fit with the rest of your deck.  Still, building up a stable of heroes and artifacts and then going out and clobbering some monsters makes for a pretty decent hour's worth of gaming.

RATING: 8.2
Fantasy deckbuilding game that's just that bit different because of some cleverly designed aspects. The constant changing pool of cards you are able to purchase is a major attraction of the game. Managing this pool is very important. You should get the cards you need and banish cards from the pool that could potentially hurt you. The constructs are also a nice addition to the system and really make it stand apart. The gameplay is quick and involved. While Dominion is almost entirely strategical, this game is very tactical. You still have to manage your deck quality and quantity though. Good card quality and great illustrations make for a well rounded solid game.

Slow to get started, quick to end.  It is a tactical game.  It has hard to have any consistent strategy.  It usually feels like your cards are stalling.

I read 2 variants that might be helpful:
* 3 rows of 4 where cards in row 2 cost +1, and row 3 cost +2.  Replace from the row above and fill row 3 from the deck.
* Use two rounds of spending 4 rune to buy anything from the deck.  After select 10 cards from the starter deck and the bought cards as your true starter deck.

I played some 'solo' by using 2d6 to simulate another player.  After each of my turns I rolled and placedthe cards that appeared in the numbered slots to the 'opponent' pile.  I used 30 honor as a pool. When all the honor the pool was acquired, I total my honor and compared it to the opponent.  It works out ok.  May need some tweaks to balance it out so that the 'opponent' wins more.

Ascension is a deck building game, but unfortunately cards available at any point in time are randomly determined, so there is really no point or possibility to plan for a specific deck time.  Generally speaking, it comes down to "Buy the most V.P. efficient card; especially if it has card draw."  Once everybody figures out what the good cards are (game 2 or 3), and everyone is buying the best available cards, it just comes down to coin flipping.

A very good game with crappy card stock.

In the end, I traded this away because I found the game repetitive and I couldn't see how an expansion would refresh the game because adding cards to the mix would just make it less likely that cards showed up during game play. I still enjoyed it played it almost 30 times (between my set and friends' sets) before getting rid of it.

If it sounds like something you might like, give it a try.

This is like the bastard lovechild of Dominion and Magic the Gathering. The four 'factions' feel a lot like Magic colours - each has a theme that you can rely on in deckbuilding. Even though there's a LOT of luck (and there is a LOT), purchasing the right faction's cards at the right time can really change your game. More depth than it pretends to have, less than you'd want for prolonged play. That being said, me and my girlfriend play it 3 or 4 times in a row most nights we play games. A great filler game for Dominion fans.

EDIT: After 14 plays, mainly 2 player, I've realised that the game is so  much better 2 -player that it's not really worth playing 3 or 4 player. By the time you add the fourth player, all forward planning disappears and (as one of my playgroup said) "the game plays you". To retain any semblance of strategy or planing, keep it to two players.

I've also come to the conclusion that 200 cards just isn't enough. You can memorize the abilities and costs of a 200-card set pretty quickly, and the game becomes quickly repetitive once you have.

EDIT AGAIN: Played a good 4-player tonight - this game punishes noobs like very few games out there, but the more experience you have with it the more you'll get out of it. I retract the statement above about 4-player being rubbish, also I've added a half-point to its rating.

I'd listed it for trade, thinking I'd played it out, but tonight I realised it's still fun - I think I'll take it off the trade list.

EDIT3: Hasn't hit the table in a long time. Not really all that interested anymore - up for trade again.

EDIT4: Traded away jul '11 for extra deck of martell cards for aGoT LCG.

RATING: 5
Calling this game designed is somewhat of as stretch.  This is yet another deck-building game with the gimmick that the cards up for purchase are random.  So the mechanics are well worn with a bad idea thrown in to make it new and different.  The random card purchases along with the rather large deck sizes completely obscures any attempts at a coherent strategy.  

Which is fine because the cards themselves were developed without any synergy at all.  The Mechana cards are a half-hearted attempt, but I would really like to see someone succeed at a Mechana strategy.  Instead the "designers" just came up with a huge pile of generic cards and threw them in a deck.  As such the best play on any round is to purchase the best card without reference to whatever may be in your deck.

Why waste your time with this when you can play any number of other games in this burgeoning genre?

I loved Ascension when I first started playing it. I have played 1000's of games of Ascension between paper at game night, iPad pass and plays and iOS games at work. However the game has become bloated and over taken by deck builders doing it better so it has dropped from an 8 to a 6 in recent times. Never makes it to the table anymore and I just play the occasion game on my android now.

Карточная игра для 2-4 игроков с механикой составления колоды во время игры в основе (как Dominion). 

Авторы: Брайн Киблер, Джастин Гэри и Роберт Дойерти. Все - опытные "картёжники" и профессиональные (причём топовые) игроки Magic the Gathering. Брайн к тому же работал над World of Warcraft TCG.

Иллюстрации своеобразные, но мне нравятся. И все одного художника - Эрика Сэби!

На первый взгляд ещё динамичнее, чем Dominion.

Pretty good game, however the Mechana cards are too OP in my opinion, if one person gets too many of them the game is over, so it basically becomes a game of preventing that person from getting any more.

RATING: 7
I love ascension even more than Dominion. I think it plays faster and is just more fun. The variance on how the cards come out may be the only negative thing in the game and even that's not too bad. If you focus too much on one thing or another it can be feast or famine. Nice quality cards and other components, a fast, fun game, and plays quickly. All good things.
     After several plays now I've seen the fun wear off a tad with this game so have lowered my rating a bit. Saw one game where a player chose cards because the art was cool (what an idiot!) and won the game! That put a definite negative on the game. Don't get me wrong. The game's still fun but it just doesn't blow me away like it used to.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Just another lack-luster deck building game.  Players buy or capture/kill cards from a 5-card tableau in order to collect VP's or better cards for their personal decks.  When one card is taken (bought or banished), it is immediately replaced with a random card from the tableau draw deck.  The game is full of boom and bust... either you have what you need to acquire cards or you don't (and cannot do much on your turn).  It's an okay way to pass the time periodically, but I don't need to own it and probably won't suggest to play it.  The expansions (some of which stand alone) add a bit of variety so I'd prefer to play with them.

** 2014 update: The more I play it, the less I like the base set.  When the standard number of VPs are used, the game ends too quickly... usually just as you dilute the start cards enough that the deck-building become interesting because you begin to see the fruits of your labor.  At least part of the problem is that it's difficult to get rid of the crappy start cards since only 2-3 purchasable cards allow you to repeatedly banish cards from your hand or discard pile.  To me, almost all of the cards in the Ascension base set feel generic and boring... and the gameplay feels sluggish, only ramping up near the end of the game.  In contrast, Ascension: Storm of Souls felt refreshing as if there were more choices/options on your turn and more interesting card powers even though the framework/basic gameplay is the same.

If you took Dominion and proceeded to remove everything good and unique from it while jacking up the price tag and adding random trinkets to the box, you'd have Ascension.

The latest game to cannibalize the Dominion deck building mechanic.  Ascension plays VERY similarly to Thunderstone, but with more polish overall.  The art design is better, the components are better, and the game flows a little better.

Ascension does a good job of fixing some of the flaws inherent with Dominion.  The cards are designed in a way that makes it difficult to get a truly bad hand, there is always something useful you can do.  The communal purchasing pool adds interactivity and allows for variety, while also requiring less setup/storage time than Dominion.  Plus, (once you get rid of the completely unnecessary board) it's MUCH more portable than Dominion; easily fitting in a pair of Magic deck boxes.

Overall, it's probably the best utilization of the deck building mechanic I've yet seen.

Interesting take on  deck building. The third edition of the base game caught my eye and based on a nice port to iPad/PC, I've added it to my game collection. It looks to be a nicely paced filler for when sessions end early. I'll be interested to see how it goes with multiple players (since it appears to be designed primarily as a two player game).
Rating preliminary...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Another take on the deckbuilding genre. It's ok - I like the quick setup and it's easy to explain.

Not so keen on: Rather mechanical, each turn is the same, you can develop your deck but it's largely dependant on what comes up in the line if you can do that. Too tactical for my tastes, again the line drives what you can do, so each turn is a maximise now decision (mostly). Graphic design, too easy to confuse mecha hero, mecha construct etc unless you play it frequently. Little player interaction - having a mechanic like Through the ages for the line (with later cards costing more and cards cycling) would give more agony of choice.

Overall, it's ok, looking to trade for a copy :)

Dominion clone with Thunderstone's theme and Dominion's simplicity.  Easy to teach, easy to play.  Time will tell if it's unique enough to stand out on its own.

UPDATE: After 50+ plays on the iPhone, this game is purely tactical.  Draw cards, get the best card available to you, rinse, repeat.  It's not about what's in your deck, it's about what can you get that turn.  Tactical, not strategic.  I like it, but I see why other people don't.

A completely forgettable deckbuilder. If this were the only deckbuilder in existence, it would be pretty good (and if I'm not mistaken, it was the first deckbuilder with an "evolving buy-line"). But in this day and age, it has nothing to offer over many other deckbuilders aside from from being simple and easy to teach.

For a similar but better game, check out Dark Gothic. It's like Ascension but with more player interaction.

I regret this.

Just the base set, plus a bonus promo card. I really wanted the 2-player intro set, but I played a 4-player game at a convention and liked it, plus the full game wasn't much more than the intro after a coupon. Still and all, this doesn't see much use, especially now that Star Realms is hitting the table.

Ascension is a pretty fun deckbuilder with lots of variety and core mechanics that are simple enough that the game is very easy to teach to new players. However, the game is not without its problems.
There is a very high random element to this game, especially when compared to other deckbuilders like Dominion or Thunderstone. You may often find yourself needing one key component to your strategy that never comes up in the game, or it will make one appearance in the game but then disappear so suddenly that you never even had a chance to pick it up.
In addition, my play group finds that there is a clear dominating strategy in this version of the game, and the only way to prevent a player utilizing the cards involved from totally walking away with the game is to deliberately tailor your entire approach to hosing that one player, meaning that IF you win the game it is not because you played well or had a good strategy, but that you simply adapted to the other guy. This tends to be an unsatisfactory way to win the game, in my opinion.
Overall, a positive gaming experience due to the variety of the cards, but be aware that the random element is very strong.

RATING: 5
Compares unfavorably to Dominion. It lacks the 'story arc' imparted by the switch to VP's that makes Dominion interesting - all the cards in Ascension are good, and give VP commensurate with their cost & ability. You never have to fear getting too many VP cards too early and crippling your deck. This causes the game to lack strategic decisions, which is compounded by the fact that to the randomness of the card draw is added the randomness of the 6 face-up cards. You don't get the benefit of concentrating on a smaller pool from among the possible choices - having every card (possibly) available every game makes it much harder to set up combos. Overall, I'm not really a fan, but it's OK to play on iPad occasionally.

Also, Mechana is way too strong. The fact that the computer AI (and I) preferentially acquire any Mechana cards we can, especially constructs, no matter what else is going on in that particular game means they're overpowered. The subsequent sets don't address this; some make it worse.

I play this on the iPad quite a bit but I'd never buy it and would resist playing in real life.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's an okay game, but the dual currency (runes to purchase cards and power to fight monsters) together with random cards in the center row create a lot of frustration. Having a hand full of one kind of currency and seeing only the other kind of cards appear in the center row happens all too often. Buying both currencies means that you will often have mediocre hands with a little of both.

There is also no limit on how many actions you can play (like in Dominion) so there are almost no cards that you do not want to have in your deck. If a card draws a card or is better than the standard non-center-row cards it's good to have it in your deck. Also all cards give victory points. That reduces the amount of difficult decisions in the game, and a lot of turns are obvious (buy the only or best you can afford, or defeat the only or strongest monster). The main decision in many games seems to be whether to buy Heavy Infantry or not. 

It's not very deep and almost multiplayer solitaire, but somehow it's still an enjoyable activity if played with few players (we made the terrible mistake sometimes of playing with more than 4 players with the expansion - that really ruins the game IMO.)

I really like the art though.

RATING: 4
Take Thunderstone and make it even MORE random.  If you hate it when you get a powerful hand in Thunderstone and there are only wimpy monsters to kill in the dungeon, you will really hate this game because there are many turns when there are NO monsters to kill (other than the Cultist "booby prize").  Knowing that going in, you skew your deck to be mostly rune (money) generating instead of combat power, but it sucks when it happens - and it happens frequently.

I can't help but compare this game to Thunderstone, because they are so similar, and Ascension really pales in comparison.  There are much fewer cards, so there is less variety in gameplay.  There are few card combos, and even the ones in the game are "iffy" to bother trying for because the other card(s) you need could be at the bottom of the draw pile and will never come out.  So the game boils down to buying the best cards that you can each turn and hoping for the best.  I'm not saying Thunderstone has a lot of strategy, but at least it has SOME strategy (go for light or not, go for card combos, etc.).  Ascension has ZERO strategy.

There's also a runaway leader problem.  Thunderstone shares this problem, but it isn't as pronounced.  There are a few powerful cards in Ascension that when purchased early on really supercharge your deck - like the "draw 3 cards" hero or some of the void cards that lets you draw cards and also thin your deck.  The player lucky enough to have those cards available during their turn will buy them and their deck will then start generating better turns, which enables buying more and better cards, and this cycle continues until the game ends and they've far outpaced their opponents.  In Thunderstone players are limited to claiming one card per turn (generally) so a "super turn" doesn't create nearly the leap ahead that it does in Ascension.

Frankly, I see no reason to play Ascension.  Play Thunderstone instead.  Ascension is quicker, but it is so random that the gameplay feels superfluous and it's really disappointing to me to play a game that is often decided buy a lucky draw or two.

Just as a random comment, the iPad version of this is very well-done, a great port of the boardgame and a nice example of an iOS game. Not sure how well it would play on a phone, though - some of the text is already pretty small on the pad.
---
This is fun. It's not in the same space as Thunderstone or Dominion, which is cool. It moves well, it's towards the lighter end of the gaming scale but there is definitely game there, and it doesn't outstay its welcome. I like it with 2, and 3 actually has a surprisingly different feel. Good stuff, not likely to have anywhere close to the staying power of a Dominion or Thunderstone, but still good.
---
Only played a couple times, but I like it quite a bit. It's in a much lighter weight class than Dominion or Thunderstone (or euros like Jambo or Blue Moon), but plays quickly, gets good mileage out of the deck-building concept, is entertaining, and varies the deck-building theme substantially from both Thunderstone and Dominion. Also, we finally have even turns and a fair endgame! I doubt it will withstand repeated play the way Dominion and Thunderstone do ... but maybe that's no bad thing.

I've played only 2-player so far, and it works very well. It's not clear to me that adding a third or fourth would improve things, as there is little gameplay scaling to speak of (Dominion and Thunderstone clearly play better with more players, assuming they don't take forever to move).

A very cool twist on the deck-building genre, introducing a bit more tactical play if you're into that kind of thing.  Each turn, your available pool of cards is going to change, so even though you can go in with a strategy, you must adapt to both the other players as well as the card selection on your turn.

I also enjoyed the "constructs" which stay face-up in front of you when you buy one (unless someone else is able to get rid of it).  They really help you pull off some bigger turns, reducing total dependence on good draws.

Overall, this is a deck-builder I would always be happy to play!  It will draw the obvious comparisons to Dominion, but it's a different beast which does a nice take on the deck-building mechanic.

Not bad.  I will play from time to time.  i like that it is easy to play and doesn't require hard thought, but i don't feel like deckbuilding in this game is as strategical as Dominion.  You get a few choices but it's usually highly dependent on what cards are available during your turn.

1 play.
4 players.  

Ascension is an intriguing attempt to refine the now-ubiquitous Dominion deck-building formula by adding a more cohesive fantasy narrative.  The game is ultimately doomed, however, by a disappointing lack of control.  

Ascension's first noticeable departure from Dominion comes in the game's lack of restrictions: you may play and purchase as many cards as your hand allows each turn.  The cards in Ascension also adds to Dominion's basic formula by provide players with [i]two[/i] currencies to manage. (I know, right?)  The first, power, is essentially a player's military might on any given turn.  The second, runes, are the game's money.  Both runes and power are "expended" each turn through the purchase of new cards or the slaying of monsters, respectively. 

This brings me to Ascension's greatest design drawback: the cards available for purchase and monsters available for slaying comprise a randomly drawn pool of six cards (from a deck of 100+, it appears).  So you're using a randomly drawn hand to make the best of a small, randomly drawn set of options.  If all you have is runes, and the pool is nothing but monsters, sucks for you.  If all you have is power, and the pool is nothing but artifacts, sucks for you.  Although the game provides weak escape valves in these instances, the impact of these moments on the players' enjoyment of the game is likely much greater than the impact of these moments on the final scores.

Relatedly, and as damningly, the random pool makes deck-building aspect of this deck-building game feel rather trivial.  Because of the limited card selection available to players on each turn, it is impossible to have any meaningful future intentions at the time you make this turn's purchase.  Sure, you can try to pick the card that works best with what you've already accumulated, but of course you also need to be able to afford it with the hand you've drawn.  This is a particularly unfulfilling form of deck-building, particularly when the game's apparent innovation was narrative consistency.  

As a extremely novice strategy point, it seems that a runes-heavy approach is all but futile.  In contrast to purchasing, slaying monsters doesn't add cards to your deck while producing victory points.  A lean deck allows for your select few purchases to reappear more often, meaning that you can actually exploit card synergies, occasionally.  It seems that the meaningful strategic decision in this game comes in deciding between a 60/40 power advantage or an 80/20 one. 

With so few truly meaningful decisions, and thematic trappings that don't really speak to me (do I really care whether I have a Void Hero or a Mechancha Hero?), this is certainly not a game that I have any interest in exploring further.  That said, it's familiar enough and innocuous enough that I wouldn't begrudge a friend who insists on bringing it to the table every now and again.

I love Ascension.  It is best played 2-player because the game's setup allows the strongest interaction and board control when played 1-on-1.  

This game has created a great open-drafting battle environment for 2-players, which is why it is one of my favorites.

Fast, simple deck builder. Instead of having a set of picked cards to buy like in Dominion, 6 random cards from the whole deck are placed in a centre row.

Pros:
- Very easy to learn
- Fast to play
- Comes with a nice sturdy board
- Good theme
- I like the chance of any card in the game coming up in the centre row

Cons
- Dire artwork. I've had to rate the game down as the card art looks like it was drawn by a 12 year old.
- Possibly a bit too random for some players
- Hard to get hold of original set now

RATING: 7
This deck-building game works well with all player counts (as I generally think most deckbuilders do, although the downtime is of course always an issue with 4 players). But I think there is much more luck involved in this game as opposed to other deck-building games like Dominion. The reason is that you never know which cards come out each round, so the hand you draw needs to match some good cards available in the play area. If there are lots of monsters available, and you don’t have a lot of attack cards, it really sucks… 
On the other hand I do like the different types of cards and the fact that you can build a strategy around some specific type of cards. However, in the end I feel the same way about this than Thunderstone; if I were to play a deck-building game, I would rather play Dominion. They take about the same time to play, but I think Dominion is the deeper game and allows some much cooler combos. Still, A:C is a fine game, it’s just not something I’m crazy about (but that is partly due to the fact that I’m not a huge fan of deck-building games).

Dropping my rating after more plays because the lack of planning is starting to bug me. With 2 players it's better because there's an idea what you might be working towards, and with more it is getting quite random. Also, some cards seem overly powerful making the game a little repetitive. I wanna like this game more, and maybe I will someday after playing with the expansions, but right now it's kind of a let down, along with the artwork.

RATING: 6
Rated 7 after one play. Having played Dominion about 80 times, this was very easy to pick up. The games are surprisngly similar. The only difference with Ascension is that there's two currencies (mana and military), and slight additional complexity with the different card types.

Really, the rating could go higher or lower, depending on what I'd learn about card balances and strategies from multiple plays. But because I already play Dominion, which I find to be a finely tuned "engine," and I'm still not tired of it, I'm not motivated to pursue Ascension. Having said that, I'd certainly play it if others are interested.

For both Dominion and Ascension, there's not much theme in either... I wouldn't say that Ascension is "Dominion but with more theme." Not really.

I regularly have a couple of friends together and we play games such as this.

I have to admit, I'm really not one for card games and the last one that I played was Pokemon in elementary school so I was really not looking forward to this one.

I gave it a chance and I was really glad I did. I really did enjoy it and despite having 3 other games to choose from, we wound up playing this one the entire night. 

The 2nd round was enjoyable but we wanted to add a little bit of a challenge to the game for the last game so we changed it up a little:

+All bloods (5 victory point tokens) and diamonds (1 victory point tokens) were in play. This made the game somewhat longer
+Instead of 6 monster/constructs/hero cards out in the center at one time, we had 12, but we couldn't replenish once we bought, we had to chose from what was out at the beginning of our turn then replenish the center once our turn was over. This really lengthened the game because we had to read each card before planning on what to do. Often times we would have to re-read them during our turn since we may make a move with part of our hand then re-evaluate with the remainder of our hand.

In short, our modification added another factor to the game. That being the difficulty in keeping up with what was out and also the elimination of cards from the center was purely to impact another player, not to see what would come up in hopes of purchasing a better card.

Whether or not the change is for you should be determined by first playing a round of it normally then deciding if you are in a mood to haggle other player's turns by impacting through elimination of center cards AND if you have enough time.

Regardless of everything, I really ended up enjoying the game though I never won it.

Revisited this (via iOS) after finding Star Realms pleasantly tolerable.

Still don't get the appeal of this. At all.

My complaints:

1. Ascension is billed as a more thematic alternative to Dominion. It's not, except by the silly definition of "thematic" that equates that term with "stuff Ritalin-deprived teenaged boys like." You could paste the same mechanics on 100 themes.

2. Its advocates point to it being more tactically interesting because of the need to balance two currencies instead of Dominion's one. True enough for what that's worth; except Dominion does not, in point of fact, have one currency. It has money, actions, buys, and additional card draws, in the base game alone. Ascension has buy-cards points, kill-enemies points, and card draws. By eliminating the limitations on taking multiple actions or buying multiple things per turn, Ascension pointlessly hobbles not only the turn-by-turn tactical questions (is there EVER a sound strategic reason to not play every card in your hand?) but also limits the diversity of possible card designs.

3. Ascension is also talked up for removing the Dominion mechanic by which points, when bought, become ballast in your hand, thus making the game faster and easier, to which I say that chess would be made faster and easier if you replaced every pawn with a queen; the burden of proof is on those who claim this makes the game better. 

4. The larger point is that the turn-by-turn card play is the decidedly less interesting aspect of Dominion as a game; a large percentage of the strategic challenge of Dominion is in the moment after the kingdom cards hit the table and before the first cards are played, when you sit and puzzle out an overall strategy. In Ascension, you can have every intention in the world of building your strategy around a key combo but if the cards don't come up at the right time, tough noogies for you.

5. Devil's Adv.: "And yet, this same sort of unpredictability, this dynamic of taking what the draw deck gives you and trying to Make Lemonade -- doesn't that also happen in Race For The Galaxy and Pax Porfiriana, and don't you love those games?" A reasonable point, DA. The difference, as I see it, is that, when the bullet hits the bone, those games afford the player multiple reasonable through-lines to victory. In Ascension, your strategic scope is limited to thinning your deck out as much as possible and/or stringing together enough card-drawers to move through your deck as fast as possible, buying shit and killing shit. How you do it is petty details, and yet those petty details are the game.

6. While there's some marginal use of the various card factions providing synergistic bonuses (the main area in which base Star Realms surpasses base Ascension), in the base game at least this mechanic seems woefully underdeveloped. It's possible this is fleshed out in the expansions, but finding this out would necessitate buying the expansions, a proposition on which your faithful reviewer forcefully demurs.

7. My opinion of the artwork has, uh, not aged like a fine wine. Fifteen minutes of looking at cards that look like concept art for dodgy heavy metal albums has my poor bedraggled eyes crying for something, anything more pleasant. "Less grotesque than Tanto Cuore" is a totally reasonable checklist item for an art director, much like "Doesn't explode without warning" is a good checklist item for a car designer. But man's reach should exceed his etc., and reaching the baseline goals, while well and good, should not preclude taking a whack at something greater. Obviously, your mileage can and will vary on this point.

RATING: 6
Ascension is a very solid deck-building game. It shares some characteristics with Dominion, but it is far from a clone. It's a game about reacting to the current cards that are available instead of planning a long-term strategy. It plays quickly, sets up quickly, and the mechanics are easy to learn and understand. Ascension shines as a two-player game. With more players it is still enjoyable but the random element increases significantly.

A Dominion clone. It eliminates the randomness on setting the initial set of cards while adding randomness in the drawing of these cards. It takes away the "combo" nature of dominion to add a "metagame" dimension.

The gameplay was a bit random and "mindless" for me, but this may change with time.  I basically just bought whatever I felt was the best card out at the time, or what worked with my deck and that's about as much control as you have.  I really enjoy the constructs that stay in play and that there is some synergy between the different factions.  My playgroup also liked it so I can see it getting more play...

At first glance, Ascension is a deck building game much like Domninion.  Unlike Dominion, it has two different kinds of currency.  One kind may buy monsters or victory points.  The other may purchase heroes or constructs.  Heroes or constructs may provide either or both kinds of currency, and may have other advantages as well, e.g. banishing cards from your deck.  Buying (called conquering) a monster may grant victory points or other advantages.  Some affect a player's opponents.  

It is also unlike Dominion in that the cards available to by are chosen from a set of 6.  Once one is gone, it is replaced.  Dominion, by contrast, has a library of cards available that does not change during the game.

Like many card games, doing well in Ascension depends more on tactics than strategy.  The best strategic plan comes to naught if the cards necessary for it never become available.

With that said, this game may be too luck-dependent for my taste.  It may happen that cards combine poorly in your hand and thus there is never quite enough of either type.  It may also happen that the cards available are too expensive to acquire, or that powerful cards seem to come to the market on other player's turns.  

The game is about 30 minutes, so I will try it a few more times and grade it with a hopeful rating of 6.  I am not confident this rating will hold.

Ascension: Chronicle of the Godslayer is a very basic deck building game that is easy to learn and fast to play. The rules are surprisingly short but should be a little more elaborate. Quite a few basic gameplay questions came up during our first game that are not answered by the rules. For some reason I really like the artwork although pastel shades usually do not appeal to me at all. But they do in this case and the fantasy steampunk theme is pretty cool. Also I like to slay Gods. The quality of the cards worries me a little, from experience with this type of card stock I'm afraid they might wear out quite fast. Especially as I expect this game to hit the table quite frequently in the future. (This is for the English Gary Games (2010) edition.)

I did'nt like the double layer of luck in these kind of games. Not only you have to get/build a decent hand, all your efforts may be spoiled by the ever changing center row. On top you may add only indirect player interaction but awful lot (multi)player chaos. 

It's nice to get time by with my iPhone, but really don't want to play face to face ever!

An alright quick game.  Unfortunately with four people you have limited ability to plan your turn out as the available cards are likely to completely change by your turn.  Frequently you seem to get stuck with runes and monsters or battle and no monsters.  Also, there is limited ability to plan your deck.  You need to buy the best cards available at the time.

Good deck-building game with dual aspects of runes and power for buying cards or defeating monsters. Best with two players or even solo. Artwork is deplorable. Not quite enough player interaction and therefore a little too much down time, this gets worse as the game goes on.

iOS Version only.

Do not take Ascension too lightly. At first, it seems so simplicistic. Its strategies are very subtle. And boy, is this game fast.

I have played it 100+ times so far (including the expansions), and it's still not getting boring in the least. I am considering buying a physical copy, but then I would perhaps win against my wife all the time and she wouldn't enjoy it. So … I'll stick with the iOS.

As a fan of Dominion (and the deckbuilding genre), I had a lot of interest in picking up this game. Little did I know I would end up liking it more than Dominion! The additional randomness of not having set decks (a la Dominion) made the game that much more interesting to me. Plus, the honor gems are awesome!

I play this on my IPad and really love how quick it is the play. I've gotten a little burnt out on deck building games--especially with how long they take to set up usually. So this IPad version is a great way for me to get in my deck building fix and not have to pull out all the expansions for Dominion. I love the differences in mechanics too. I like having a rotating set of 6 cards you can buy. It is a nice mix.

Feels very unlike Dominion, and very streamlined - I played Thunderstone directly after it, once, and found that Thunderstone felt like a lumbering behemoth by contrast.

Even adding an "on deck" row so there's some foreknowledge of what's coming out, though, it's just too tactical and too random for my tastes. It was fun to play half a dozen times, but not something I'll seek out now.

RATING: 6
Muy buen juego de DB, pero para mi gusto, demasiado corto. Las fichas de PV siempre desaparecen antes de que te des cuenta. Además, tiene bastante factor azar, pues las cartas con las que mejoras el mazo salen aleatóriamente, en vez de estar fijas en un banco o reserva. Siempre se tiene la sensación de que las cartas buenas salen cuando les toca a los rivales...

In deck building games, this probably the less strategic of all. But also the best component and as fun as others. The idea to combine all card pool seems work. And it does make the game easier to setup and clean up.

A game based on deck-bulding mechanism. 
A little bit too random for me, and some cards seem overpowered. 
But I need to play more in order to get the game better.
Upd. Definatelly, the cheapest cards are overpowered - there is no action limit in Ascension, and thus you don't have to think about that problem.

For trade in UK Math Trade or BGG Trade.

Components checked.

This fantasy-themed deck building game is quick to learn and is a great game to buy if you're new to deck building games.  

The artwork is really divisive: some love it, some hate it!  Personally I like it.  The artwork gets better with subsequent expansions.

All of the sets in Ascension are not particularly deep or strategic.  There is randomness in the way Ascension plays.  But I love the Ascension sets because they're quick to set-up, the  turns are quick, the ease of play, trying new sets mixed together is fun and being able to play cool combo turns when you get some really good cards in your deck is so much fun.

Storm of Souls has more variety to it than the original Chronicles of the Godslayer (re-named as "Ascension: Deckbuilding Game"), so Storm of Souls might be a better starting choice if you're a more experienced deck building gamer.

RATING: 6.5
Easy to learn, quick to set up and quick to play deck-building "almost fantasy" theme game, which have tons of pros; unfortunately for every of those pros, there is some "but" attached. I believe that some of them can be solved by expansion sets (etc. lack of variety), but some of these "buts" are in core mechanisms of game itself. And that is why I do not think that Ascension is on same piedestal as the best games in deck-building genre (and it is not just Dominion which comes to mind). But still... All of this does not mean that Ascension is just avarage or a bad one, neither that it is not fun to play a game or two once a time. It is just very inconsistent in every way.

This is a decent deckbuilder, but it falls short of games such as Dominion and Thunderstone due to its higher element of randomness thanks to the much-maligned market row mechanic. In those two games, the bulk of the randomness occurs prior to the start of the game, then you can develop a winning strategy based on the cards on offer. 

In Ascension, with the available card pool constantly changing, developing and sticking to a cohesive strategy can be difficult, and not being offered the cards you need can be a frustrating experience. With Thunderstone and Dominion as options, I don't see this one hitting the table very much.

Fast playing, easy to explain, and fun, even if what card comes up next is a big part of how the game turns out. Definitely overproduced, this would have been much better in a Heroes of Graxia sized box without the board or the "gems", but I'm sure I'll be happier once they've started to put out expansions. Perhaps the most bizarre art I've ever seen in a game, but at least it's not the standard fantasy paintings in every other deck building game out there.

Android. Extremely luck-centric deckbuilder. It's fun when the center row works out your way, but just frustrating when the row spits out all sorts of cards that don't work for you. Therefore it's best suited for the digital realm, where a "bad game" still will take 15 minutes at the most.

I enjoyed this game immensely. The games finish fairly quickly and i always feel like playing again. Deckbuilding could be one of my favorite styles of gameplay, and this game gives it nice flavor and a good amount of variation when you take into account the various expansions and flavor packs. Having said that, that does make it slightly cost prohibitive if you want to keep it fresh.

Doesn't seem very deep. More of a time waster (like solitaire) than an actual game. The different card and base types don't seem to have much impact on the gameplay. You basically play everything in your hand and buy the best card you can afford and defeat the biggest monster you can. Repeat.

The Ascension logo looks very cool though. The card art is nothing special in my opinion.

One play in. Meh, I'm not impressed. I didn't find it anywhere near as interesting as [i]Thunderstone[/i] or [i]Dominion[/i]. On most turns my choices felt as obvious as they were limited, and victory depended entirely on where and when the cards fell, rather than on any particular choices I made.

Compare that with [i]Dominion[/i], where your success or failure rests on the card selections you make, rather than what the game makes for you. This is basically just filler.

See Ben's (chally) comments for a more thorough synopsis that I agree with completely.

Update: I've upgraded my rating a bit, since it has found a place on my iPad. Still, it's not something I want to play F2F.

RATING: 6.5

It was.... okay.... I suppose.

Not horrible, but nothing new/great.

One thing that I can say is that the rulebook is atrociously written... they leave out basic things that you'd have no idea what to do.

For instance:

You flip out a new card onto the main row immediately after purchasing/destroying/etc one. THIS WAS NOWHERE IN THE RULEBOOK!

Barry and I were like... "okay... wtf? When do you replace the card. After turn, before turn...??" We had no idea until he looked it up on BGG.

Also, as it compares to Dominion:

Dominion has the ABCD turn order.... Ascension doesn't have that fluid order... you can really play all your cards face up in front of you and basically do everything at once in any order... it doesn't freakin' matter... Not that it matters as much in Dominion, but the order in which you play your action cards matter.... Ascension (that I understand) simply doesn't care.

Have only played with two people.  The game is a lot of fun and there are a lot of different strategies you can try to use to win.  There are different factions for cards and sometimes trying to build up a certain faction is most beneficial, but other times just going for a powerful mix hand works in your favor.  Also, the game revolves around collecting honor by defeating certain foes, but you still need to build up mystic as well as attack to be effective.  

Fun, light deckbuilder.

The first time I played this, I hated it. I thought the game was much like Dominion, except very limited and too random to make any strategy. After playing a few more times, though, I've started realizing some strategy in the game, although it's still very situational and lacking in the level of strategy and control I desire. I still have fun playing with this, now that I've become more accustomed to it, though.

RATING: 7.5
This is a very good deck building game.  It is quite simple, and also has several layers of depth that are revealed with multiple plays.  I was dubious to begin with because I figured nothing would live up to the standard of Dominion, but this game is worth playing.  It is a little more random than Dominion because of how the available cards might not line up with your draw (in other words, there are two shifting variables instead of one, leading to more volatility in the luck of the draw), but it has a lot of skill none the less.  

If Ascension had come out before Dominion (or booster drafting), I probably would have rated it a full point higher.  Instead, I'm already familiar with most of the concepts, which means it was less novel and it took less time for me to figure out how to play well.

--- EDIT ---
I increased the rating from 7.5 to 8.  The game has more skill than I at first gave it credit for.  A lot of time was put into thinking the cards through and balancing them.  The value of each cards changes depending upon the cards in your deck and the length of time left in the game.  I should have expected more from my fellow Magic player game designers.  Kudos!

At first glance, the game has a lot in common with Dominion. But you get to play all your cards, kill as many monsters as you have the power to kill, and buy as many cards as you have the runes to buy with. No worrying about having sufficient +Action and +Buy cards, or coins going to waste. I like the way the game is driven to closure through the mechanism of honor points.

Only played it with some expansions thrown in but I liked it. You still have the luck of the draw but it's not as terrible as it is in Thunderstone so even it's not really the same type of game I'd pick this game over Thunderstone any day of the week.

The art is a bit weird but I guess you could become used to it.

RATING: 4
Dumbed down deck-builder.  Removing ideas such as "buy" limits and cards that clog your deck from the Dominion template rob the game of difficult decisions and make it feel like a mindless race.  Add in a healthy dose of luck as the random supply draw can dictate the winner.

Ascension is a deck-building game along the same lines of Dominion or Thunderstone, but rather than a variable set of 10 types of kingdom cards that you can build in any given game, it has a set of cards that are randomly drawn from a deck as old ones are purchased. Three cards are always available for purchase to add consistency. To add additional complexity to the game, there are two types of currency to manage: runes, which let you buy cards, and power, which lets you kill monsters for one time special effects and victory points. The game continues until a pile of victory point chips, which varies based on the number of players, is emptied, with the most points winning.

I was an early adopter of Dominion but, after about 70 plays, decided that it was ultimately too repetitive and not nearly tense enough for my tastes. I did not find the interactions to be interesting and greatly preferred card games like Race For the Galaxy or Glory to Rome. Ascension seemed different enough from Dominion that it looked like it was worth getting into, but the overall lack of ability to build any real strategy killed the game for me. I don’t have a problem with more tactical games, games that are mostly simple deck-building, and perhaps economic snowball games in general, are not for me.

This game has found a bit of a new life for me on iOS. It is a game I can play while doing other things, and probably epitomizes the pick up, play, and put down ease of use that makes iOS games great. My rating on iOS is probably a 5 or 6.

RATING: 8
Players build up there deck to accumulate victory points, via slaying monsters and acquiring prestigious cards.  Dominion clone where players play out their five card hand, purchasing more cards for their deck, or slaying monsters on the display for victory points.  At the lighter end of the Dominion/Thunderstone complexity scale, and it suffers slightly because of it - still no bad thing as the game works well and would be easy to introduce to non-gamers.  Various strategies seem viable.  Worked well, and quite quick.  Good stuff.  Superb on the iOS devices.

I appreciate the streamlined design, and the quick setup and quick play.  This is one of the few card games that I really like that can fit into my lunch break (I'm getting bored with San Juan so this is much appreciated). There is definitely a significant luck factor, but I feel like each game I discover new depth in the decision making, so it's too early for me to decide if the amount of luck is too much or just right. I know some people have complaints about the art, there are a few images I don't love, but overall I really like it, and appreciate the fact that the game has a unique style compared to most other games.

Update: I play this a lot more than my tracked plays indicate, because I don't track iOS games. Over time, I've grown to appreciate the game more, and I think that there is more skill required than some people initially thought, as I seem to have quite an edge over newer players. I'm not crazy about some of the stuff in the expansion sets though. I don't think more than 1 expansion was needed really, it's fine with just the original set.

RATING: 3
Initial impression very bad. It's another Dominion derivative, but the array of cards to choose from is always changing. Which could be good, but here it's not. Sure, you get to see more variety of stufff in a given game. But under almost the entire game your choices are randomly presented to by whatever is left by previous player and randomly flipped by the draw. Basically you take the best stuff you can afford every turn, there's no strategy to speak of.

This game is a good intro-level deckbuilder, but in a four player game luck has much more to do with who wins than anything else. Duels mitigate the luck much better, but there is also a problem with the lane getting monster-clogged if you get a bad draw.

RATING: 2
A tactically-focused deckbuilder. I played once in person and enjoyed it, but after ~20 more games, the flaws become more apparent. The game simply doesn't afford enough space for cards to be valued in meaningfully different ways.

Initially, you'll see and learn the tradeoff between the acquisition of powerful cards and the acquisition of cards useful only for honor. As time goes on, though, it becomes fairly clear that this tradeoff is clear for the vast majority of the game, only providing meaningful decisions in a slim minority of cases.

The rune/power split also seems to provide interest at first, but again the decisions become very simple as the game goes on. Building decks that can meaningfully provide both resources at the same time is a mug's game, and there's no major benefit for being able to do both at once other than the occasional clogged row. So the game's dual-currency, rather than being a force of strength, really just further constrains your turn-by-turn decision-making options. It's more than a bad design decision; it's one entirely opposed to the game's supposedly tactical focus. 

The game isn't entirely without merit; there's some interesting factional synergies, and the playthrough of a given hand is sometimes enjoyable. That said, the game's flaws outweigh its merits, and it's entirely a forgettable experience.

I'm approaching this game as a tactical game; some will point to the game's supposed thematic strengths. Really, though, the game's theme is practically nonexistent. Acquired-and-spent power, runes used to purchase cards, and the rotating center row are given no justification (they don't need one, as the game is entirely a tactical decision-making exercise, but I think it's worth addressing the claim that the game is thematic).

I actually enjoyed the artwork and design of the original, but it looks like the newest version has removed whatever visual distinction the game had in favor of a blander style with more popular appeal.

I like the idea of this but the execution left me cold.

I was constantly unable to do anything useful when my turn came around as the cards in the centre at that specific moment in time were basically useless to me.  Naturally whilst waiting for my turn I would also see cards that were useful to me (based on my hand) coming and going before I had a chance at them.  Frustrating.

I was a big fan of Magic the gathering, so I am already pumped to play card games. I was lucky enough to see someone playing Ascension and they let me join in. One hour later I was hooked, I bought the game the next day and me and my friends played for three hours. I love the theme, and the simplicity of the game. No one feels like they are being picked on since every player is playing against the board. I like how your deck is random and new every game. This game won't be for everyone, but it was right for my group.

This game misfires on many levels.  (1)  There is very little stragey compared to other deck-building games.   In fact, many of the cards that give you points don't even go into your deck, so the building element of deck building is lacking.   (2) It's over-produced.  The cards are too big, too thick, and too glossy.  The board is totally unnecessary.   The gems are massive.   The box is huge.   (3)  The artwork looks like it was done in colored pencils in a 5th grader's sketchbook.   I realize they are going for a consistent style here, but this is really hard to look at.   (4)  The rule book has the biggest fonts you've ever seen and fails to answer some of the most basic questions about the game.   (5) simplistic, very random, no planning, etc.   Okay, I'm done.   Not a good game at all.   Glad I had a chance to play it before buying it.  I'd much rather play Dominion or Thunderstone.

Very easy to learn. This was the first deck building game I have played. The theme is a plus and it plays quickly. Luck plays a huge role in this game, which is a drawback. I have read Heroes of Graxia and Thunderstone are heavier games with less luck involved so I might seek one of those out next.

Very fine deckbuilder. We love the art but I see why others do not find it appealing. It's actual *art*, not cartoony, and the quality of art will be in the eye of the beholder. It plays fast & has nice theme for 2p. I have seen the objection that it starts to break down as the number of players go up and I can see how that would happen; the middle row would turn over constantly and you would always have a fresh board & be unable to influence the selections of most other players. But at 2p it works very well for my 13 year old and me to play in about half an hour, which makes it perfect.

The dual resources combined with never knowing what will appear next in the center row makes this game more luck based than Dominion.

It's like someone played Dominion but hated how precisely you have to build your deck.  I really like the precision of Dominion- it's what makes the game challenging to learn and worth replaying over and over.  Ascension isn't a bad game, but it just kinda feels easy.  It's designed so that you can accumulate points without penalty and you always have something to do on your turn.  It's not bad, and the game is fun, but I rarely feel like I'm being challenged when I play it.  Also the luck of the market can be frustrating.

I really love bizarre mythological and fairy tale style folk art, and that pretty much sums up the art in this game.

I really love trying to figure out the best way to build decks around certain cards.  I really love that there are a few different ways to get points and you need to choose what is going to work best for your deck.  

I found drafting and controlling the center row to be much more interactive than other deck builders.  The game seemed easy and pretty solitary the first few times around because every card does something, there aren't any deck cloggers, and all non-basic cards are worth points. But it eventually clicked, and I realized it's as much about building decks as it is manipulating the center row (which is the essential function of your deck).  

Players don't have equal opportunity, and that's what makes this game so interesting - you need to make openings for yourself while trying to set up a center row that fustigates your opponent.  

I love it!

so my first pass through didn't change my deck...2nd pass was about the same. i was effectively eliminated from any meaningful decisions for 80 minutes... yuck.

Got this from my Secret Santa 2012.
Looking forward to try it. :)

EDIT: Played it - loved it!
It is a perfect crossing betwen Dominion

It gave me that good old MtG-feeling,
but a lot easier to teach to people.

EDIT2: Bumped it from 8 to 7 after 4 plays.
It might just be me, but the game seems a bit to
Random for what strategies you can make.
The constant flow of everchanging cards makes it very hard  to finetune your deck.
Some might see that as a strength in this game,
but for me it's a little annoying.
But still - I like the game.
I wonder how it would play if took out a faction....?

Feels like deckbuilding for dummies. I love me some deckbuilding, but this game hardly offers choices in what you add to your deck. This game isn't bad as in glaringly flawed; it just doesn't offer much in terms of choices or uniqueness. I see no reason to play this over the other deckbuilding games I own.

Oh and, I'm not usually one to comment on/care about the art, but this art is terrible. It looks like it was drawn by a high school kid, expressing his angst with a set of colored pencils.

Shortest time owning a game ever. Received 11/7, traded 11/10 for Kingsburg.

[b]Edit (11/7/13):[/b] Having played the iOS version countless times now, I have gone from hating this game to loving it. The art is still terrible, but the game is awesome.

A fantasy deckbuilder that plays quickly. Opponents choose cards to either add to their deck or banish cards from play, using two different currencies. The available cards change at any time, with some cards only appearing once in any game. I liked this game on the ipad, but grew tired of crappy AI, I suspect there's a bit more length to the game against a tough opponent.

30-45m, 2 players. 5+ plays.

This is a very tactical deck building game that is very easy to setup and begin playing.  The sacrifice is that the game is very tactical.  So when you combine the randomness of your card draws and randomness of what's in the tableau, I sometimes find it surprising the game has any legs to it at all.  That said, I like the combos and different syles of decks you can create.  I also think it's nice that there are various factions that are good at specific functions, which really gives the game a nice flare of personality.  I should note that I really like the strange artwork in this game, but please note that some people consider it to be unpleasant/hideous.  I definitely consider this the best deck building game I've played.

Not Dominion combined with Magic. It's "Dominion" (I guess) combined with Drafting! Or... Drafting combined with not having to be rich... Moving from a 10 to an 8, based on plays with more than 2 players.

This was enjoyable and i love a good deckbuilder, but the 'Ascension style' of deckbuilding seems to favour those in the know much more than the 'Dominion style'.

Yes yes, it is another Dominion clone that does some things better and some worse.

Pros: Much smoother gameplay (less "mathy" counting of buys and actions). More variety while playing the game (a whole deck of different cards instead of 10 stacks). Easier after game clean up.

Cons: Clunkier scoring (I dislike having EACH card worth victory points AND having a VP pile), Random purchases at any given time (the more players the less you can plan a deck build). Definite advantage to going first with more players (all cheap cards can be bought before the last player, leaving him with the disadvantage of having expensive cards and monsters he can not buy/attack on turn one).

In all, I wouldn't buy it, but would play someone else's copy on occasion.

Very fun Game, very similar to Dominion. Like Dominion, there are multiple strategies one could employ to ultimately win the game. However, the base game is less than half the number of cards as Dominion, so the number of possible strategies, and overall replay value is lowered. There were three things I personally found more enjoyable in Ascension than Dominion: Ascension has more player interaction, and one player's turn has a much bigger impact on the next player's turn; Ascension's theme is more entertaining, the background is much richer than Dominion, and you can tell that the designers took influence from Magic: The Gathering; finally Ascension is substantially faster to set up and play, which is always a plus in my book. This is a really good game for collectible card game player that bridges the gap between a game like Magic: The Gathering and a board game.

(Rating including expansion: [thing=157026]Realms Unraveled[/thing]; Rating also based on hundreds of plays on the app)

This is a great deckbuilder. Mainly for three reasons:

1) You can make some insane combos! I've got the app to crash on several occassions because I played 30+ cards in a single turn.

2) Setup is really fast! This is a big plus for me.

3) All the cards you acquire are worth points and there are also crystals you can acquire directly or by beating up monsters that are worth points. So you don't have victory point cards clogging up your deck.

The one downside: It is ugly. Not for lack of a better term. Really ugly. Also, there are much better sets than the original one, so this rating is explicitly for Ascension including expansions. The base game by itself would probably be a 7.

Awesome, awesome, awesome!  Only played as a 2 player game and is always an amazing time when it hits the table.  Despite what some others say, I think the art is spectacular and am glad it doesn't fit into the standard fantasy mold.
EDIT: I've now played it multiple times with 3 and 4 players.  Still a great game and I still think the art is awesome despite all the idiots out there that think it sucks.  This one is simple and easy to teach but I think is a more fun deck builder than Dominion.  And I like the random element of the middle deck row.

I'd give this game an 8 for a casual card group that likes deckbuilding games but doesn't want much strategy.  I'd give it a 2 for a competitive playgroup that wants your skill to strongly influence your chance of winning.  It also uses a card-stock that I do not like.  Its thick and hard to shuffle.  Seems beefier (but cheaper) than standard cards like MTG or Dominion.
Rules are very easy, and play time it sets up and plays quickly, which are all pluses.  Major negative is just that it seems VERY random.

Ascension is one of the finest deckbuilding game I've ever played.  Every turn presents you with unique choices, and the choices vary radically from turn to turn.  It's relatively simple to explain to new players and not quite as much of a hassle to clean up as other deckbuilding games.  I'm also a fan of the unique art, which brings to mind the eccentric style of early Magic: the Gathering cards.

RATING: 7
Definitely not Dominion though it is still nice.  There is luck in it but that and also that it plays fast is what make this a great game to play with your kids.  The rule book is short and to the point however it didn’t clarify when you should replenish the center with new cards.  You will be doing this as you gain cards and defeat monsters so you’ll always have many options as long as you have cards in your hand.

RATING: 5
I'm not a big fan of Dominion but this deck-builder grabs me with quick play and a big assortment of cards, and the cards are simple to read/play.

After playing hundreds of games against the app AI I think this game can be rather swingy and luck-based depending on what cards come out and when you can grab/deny them. Sometimes a player can just hit the groove of acquiring Mechana cards and there's nothing that can counter it.

Even so, it's still enjoyable to play.

I think out of the 3 similar games, at this time the other two being Dominion & Thunderstone, I will place this one in the middle.  This is the easiest to play and takes far less time to teach newbies, which is in its favor.  At this time I am rating it lower than Dominion because I feel the luck element is much stronger and some cards are overpowering, especially in combination with others. Although it does have far more luck than Thunderstone, because the play is far simpler and setup is faster as well as play, I rate it above Thunderstone.

I enjoy all 3, and glad I own all three. 

Have ordered box & sleeves from Board & bits

Of course expansions will be coming, and hopefully additional cards will balance out the game better.

Edit: I have raised the rating since this one has continued to hit the table more often than many other games.  I have enjoyed it more with repeated play.

EDIT:  I recently placed an order from the publisher's web site, and had a complaint which I registered by email.  Gary responded immediately with apologies and corrected the problem with a very surprising bonus.  This is a top notch company who cares about their product and customers, and they go the extra mile. Thank you, so much!

Mindenfélét hallottam róla ezért vegyes érzelmekkel ültem neki. Egyrészt nekem a képek alapján nem volt gondom a sokat szidott grafikával, másrészt régóta vágyom egy tematikus dominionra, viszont féltem kicsit tőle, hogy túl egyszerű, butácska lesz. Pl. a thunderstone nem különösebben jött be, mert nem nagyon láttam benne döntési helyzeteket.

Szerencsére e félelmem nem igazolódott. Első játékra semennyire se sikerült megfejteni. Nagyon sok a kártya, képesség, amit nem igazán láttunk még át. Elég sokféle cucc közül tudsz választani minden körben a piacról, nomeg agyalni kell rajta, hogy mit mi után érdemes csinálnod, hogy kihozd a maximumot a körödből.
Az viszont látszott, hogy nem kicsi a szerencse szerepe a piacra ellenfélnek ledobott kártyákkal, bár ezt biztos lehet csökkenteni, a piacról eldobós lapok kör végére meghagyásával.

Azt még nem tudom eldönteni, hogy ha kiismerjük (minden lapot kép alapján megismerünk), akkor mennyire lesz benne még újrajátszhatóság. De addig is még van benne legalább 10-20 party, amiket már nagyon várok. :)

Egyelőre 7, aztán majd meglátjuk. 

Jó ez a játék. Könnyed, gyors, bőven van benne mákfaktor, de a hossza és a hangulata miatt ez nem zavaró. Gyorsasn lehet tolni még egyet, ha valakinek fáj éppen a vereség. :)

-> 8
----
Iszonyatos a randomfaktora, ráadásul igen fájdalmas módon. Ez a lapfelcsapósdi középre nagyon az ember arcába vágja azt, hogy éppen nincs szerencséje, ami szerintem nem jó. Így teljesen el tud veszni a fun és feeling, és az egész egy nagy erőlködéssé válik. Jó lenne bele valami szerencsekorlátozó (vagy kevésbé arcbavágós) megoldás, mert amőgy jó játék lenne.

-> 7
-----------
A többsoros (3x3 vagy 4x3) variánssal sokkal jobb lett, aminek nagyon örülök, mert nagyon szeretném szeretni, csak randomitás eddig kiverte a biztosítékot. 
A többsoros teamplayt kéne még kipróbálni. Az már nagyon fejvakarós lehet. :)

RATING: 3
Ascension is another deck-building game trying to stand on the shoulder of Dominion. Supposedly, deck-building is about long-term strategy. After all, if you could simply restructure your entire deck from turn to turn that entire aspect would be kind of pointless.

Ascension looks promising at first because there are several factions which often provide nice benefits when used with other cards of the same faction so some sort of specialization looks to be the way to go. Makes sense so far? What doesn't make sense, however, is that the game then kills every attempt at exploiting those combos by providing a randomly drawn pool of cards to purchase from or fight for points each turn. Whether the cards you need for your strategy will ever come up is unknown. There goes your strategy.

Instead, the game degenerates into micro-optimizing each individual turn which offers neither interesting decisions nor any sort of control.

I really enjoy this game and think the art direction and mechanical faction design is very well done.  Highly appealing to me as a former M:tG player that grew tired of the arms race and expense.

First impressions - better than the reviews made it seem. It's easy to set up and get playing. It does not have the depth or replayability of Dominion, but I am encouraged from my initial game that it has a good place for a filler game that had value without feeling committed to a longer game. The luck value is much higher than in Dominion, but there are strategies that reveal themselves quickly with play.

This game was so easy to learn and so easy to teach to my 8 and 10 year old.  I found this to be strange considering the box says that this game is for ages 13+.  The quality of the cards are super nice.  

I find this to be a great gate-way into the "deck-building" genre.  We really enjoy it a lot and it's refreshing to play a game that plays so fast (once everyone got comfortable with the rules and mechanics of course).

This is a deck building game I can like.  Doesn't feel like endless action chains or have multiple forms of currency.  Simple and effective.  2 forms of currency (attack and money).

Pros: each game is unique since the center row to choose from is random and there's a large variety of cards. You could say this gives it replayability.

Cons: the game is highly dependent on luck. In some cases (I'd say a good third or more), you can tell who is going to win the game based on the first 2-4 turns. If there's a deck management card that you are able to get to first, you will have a tremendous advantage unless one happens to come up for your opponent(s) early. Likewise with certain constructs. This really detracts from enjoyability.

Fun game that is amazingly easy to explain and I like the unique artwork. The game is very streamlined, but that doesn't mean the game is too light. I appreciate the design and think it is quite clever. What appeals to me is that you really have to adapt in this game. You get ideas of strategies the more you play, but you still have to be on your toes.

It's a good sign when players wish to play this one again immediately after playing it the first time.

People are whining like crazy about card-size differences, but honestly, you'll want to sleeve your cards anyway and that fixes the problem. Even if you are not into sleeves, it isn't like it matters that much when you are drawing cards from the deck anyway. I understand ocd, but some people are O to the C to the D when it comes to this game's components.

UPDATE: I continue to play it, I continue to enjoy it. They've done a great job with the first two expansions, so I am upping my rating. Each expansion expands on the story and the added mechanics really integrate nicely. Also, the artwork has improved I think with each release.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
In the end this just wasn't very engrossing to play live. The theme and artwork are so terrible. The artwork looks like a bored high schooler drew the pictures. There's no hook to draw you in, to make you care about what's happening.

------------------------------------------------------

I've played this to death on the iPod, and I think it actually plays better there than on the table. There are a lot of different card effects to keep track of every turn, so much so that even after half-a-dozen games with my group, they are forgetting how things work. On the iPod, it keeps track of all your stuff for you. It's one of my most-played games on the iPod because it's light and generally mindless but with a little bit of fun strategy.

The actual game has not gone over as well with my group as I thought it would. I'm not sure why that is; maybe just not enough control or decisions to be made?

WoW. Much better than "thunderstone". That's for sure, but it's not the same game. Here you don't know the cards in play so you can't build a pre-constructed strategy. 
In Ascension you have to change that strategy and adapt. More options, more monsters and keepers. You can see the designer was a "magic pro-gamer" and that improve the combo options mixing the cards.

We have really been enjoying this lately.  Quick setup and it plays quick too. To me, it provides a somewhat similar feel to Thunderstone (old school), but is quicker and personally, more rewarding.  Also, and I'm probably in the minority here, I really like the artwork.  It's different and I like the simplistic style.  I feel like this is going to personally replace Nightfall and Thunderstone, although those games vary enough that one could keep all three.

I find this game to be really fun to play, but like many games in this deck building style; the more you have the more fun it is.

I do have to say the one thing I like best about this particular deck building game is how each card can be used during the game. No cards are useless while the game is being played.

I do wish to see more interaction between the players though. Maybe some hand manipulation rules or something along those lines.

While I didn't actively dislike Ascension, I don't see any reason to play it, because it's inferior to other games in its genre. The constantly churning card menu means there's no capacity for players to plan ahead or think strategically. The decisions all feel very easy, with each turn feeling the same as the previous turn. If I needed to take a bathroom break and asked any random halfway decent gamer to take over my position for a few turns, I wouldn't worry at all. They would probably do exactly the same moves I would have done - the game is that obvious.

[b]UPDATE[/b] Raised rating from 4 to 5. Adding the Storm of Souls expansion and playing strictly with two players does make for a better game. For me, this is an iPad-only game. It's actually [i]outstanding[/i] in that format, where the annoying bookkeeping, shallowness, extreme randomness, and mostly solitaire gameplay are not significant issues.

I bought this on a whim. 

The production quality brings this down a lot for me.  The artwork is weird.

Firstly, one card was nicked straight from the wrap.
Secondly,two cards ripped during shuffling.
Thirdly, there is a shameless advertisement for card sleeves on the back of the manual.  Didn't realize it was a requirement in order to play the game.

How many other games have thin cards that don't rip like these?  I outta know owning as many games as I do.  Board is slightly warped as well.

I've never bought a game with cards this shxxxy.  I bought high quality sleeves for the game, not from their shameless sleeve gouge, and now it's fine.

The game itself is a bit random but has a quick setup time, and takes considerably longer than 30 minutes.  Artwork isn't consistent either.

My group plays it a lot in substitute of Dominion so raising rating (and I haven't recorded my dozens of plays).  Not as good but quicker. +1

-1 for crappy quality.

We play it a lot so bumping rating.

RATING: 6
Neither a step forward nor backwards compared to Dominion. There are only slight differences, so it can be considered a step sidewards, more of the same. Dominion felt a bit more Euro, while this a bit more Ameri. However the artwork is underwhelming imho. As you use all of the cards in one game (in Dominion you preselect some sets) you got more variety within one play and the success of strategies is not guaranteed as cards may turn up or not or get even banished by opponents. So there is slightly more hazard bua also interaction in it. All in all Ascensions suffers still at the same edges of being rather multiplayer solitaire and creating endless card chains resulting in more downtime for your fellow players.

*Game Experience (1-10) - 5 (A little too simplistic for me.  Players who are new to deckbuilders might find this a good gateway game.  It plays the same solitaire as it does competitive.  There is little social aspect to the game nor is there much of a way to effect the other player(s) on or outside of your turn.)
*Elegance (1-10) - 10 (This game may suffer from too much playtesting.  It feels like a reskinning of other deckbuilders with no unique element to give it's own experience.)

Probably the worst implementation of a deck-building game I've seen. You have two units of currency: runes and combat. You use these to acquire more cards and/or score victory points.

I picked this up on the advice of a friend.  I like this game as a filler between heavier/longer games.  Think of it as a cross between Magic and Dominion.  There is really no direct confrontation as you are building a deck to collect "Honor" to win.  Honor is collected by killing monsters or buying powerful heroes and constructs.  I hated the artwork at first, but then it grew on me the more I played the game.  Bottom line, this is easy to teach, easy to play, and is a quick setup and breakdown.

I was happily surprise by this one.  Yes, it's another "deck building" type game, but this one is bare bones, and works remarkably well.

Only played one game, which ended in a Triple tie in first place (51 points), with the last player no more than 5 points behind.

The tie breaker is the reverse order of the turn order, but we decided to call it a tie nonetheless.

I did not like the graphics/images, but that just personal taste.  The game play itself is fairly straight forward, especially if you have played other "deck building" type games before.

I liked the row of 6 cards where you can purchase as many cards as you have money, and kill as many monsters as you have attack points.  And there were plenty of "banish" cards which allowed you to thin out your deck.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A trimmed down deckbuilding game, which seems like a good idea. Problem is, with a constantly shifting "bank" of cards to buy, you have little in the way of choice with regards to planning ahead. You won't be making a finely tuned deck, just grabbing the best thing you can each turn. There are permanents that help you every turn, but just as many cards that get rid of them. I didn't mind it, but I think that's just because I like the genre so much. Still, Dominion, Thunderstone, and Puzzle Strike are better, deeper games, so why bother with this?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Improved in many ways what Dominion started in my life. Now it just feels like a dumbed down Legendary or a less fluid Cryptozoic Deck Builder. Still fun to bring out once in awhile. I really like the expansions but I dislike how diluted the card base gets when you incorporate an expansion.

Wow is this boring. On your turn you look what your best option is & do it, rinse & repeat until the end & find out who had the most luck.

Usually it's the starting player because he had the first pick of cards.

This game is good fun. I've never played a deck building game that really has such influence on your opponent. Unfortunately it does get old rather quickly compared to other games, and needs healthy doses of expansions to stay alive. The game works poorly with over 2 players, since you can no longer affect your opponents as well.

1-2-11
In retrospect from my one play of this game, there are a number of things I don't like about this Dominion-esque game.  It's a difficult game to understand right away because of all the randomness and hidden information.  I think that's a great thing about Dominion - all of the possible cards are in the open from the start so there are no surprises and very little randomness.

Once you get used to the card functions, you realize how useless a couple of the mechanisms are.  Constructs end up getting destroyed by other cards by the time you even get one played in front of you.  The colors as far as different 'races' go seemed like a totally useless 'feature' and only served to be more confusing.  Again, comparing to Dominion, color-coding between rune cards and military cards would have been a lot easier and remove some useless fluff.

I thought the art style was pretty mediocre.  Mediocre and difficult to see from across the table since many cards look too similar.  Again beat by its superior, Dominion, in this regard.

The game itself just isn't that fun.  Since the board is entirely random, there is no planning.  Any plans you have for your turn will likely be shot completely by the time you can play again in a 4-player game.  That and the randomness of your deck, supplied by random card picks which are basically just picking the best opportunity.  There is no strategy at all - you simply react to what is out there.  You can lean a certain way perhaps, but leaning is nothing compared to the crunching you can try to do in Dominion.  I keep referring to that game - and it is far superior.  These guys should stick to MtG.

[i]Comments for the first edition "Godslayer" version, played exclusively 2p against the iPad AI:[/i]

Originally, I hated my surface pass on this one:  the art was ugly; the gameplay simplistic, derivative and limited.

Then, after like a billion plays on the iPad, I finally "got" the art, appreciating the iconic, atavistic religiosity of it*, as well as the game-wide unifying aspect of having a single artist's vision throughout; and the game that seemed so simple on the surface cracked open and exposed vistas of interaction, tactics and strategy.  Every time I think I've topped out with the killer approach I find new pathways that go deeper into weird labyrinths.

To top it off, the fantasy world presented in the game is like peeking into someone's private wank-bank of bizarre fetishes; it is wonderfully nonstandard and "wiggy".

The whole shebang is a triumph of undiluted vision.

UPDATE:  8 --> 7  Honestly, just wore this one out.  It was good for more digital plays than I can count (which really does put it into the "outstanding" category), a fantastic toy while it lasted but I find I'm done with it now.

UP-UPDATE:  7 --> 8  That wiggy world has pulled me back in and I find myself wanting to play constantly—[COLOR=#FF0000]it's a big badass comic book[/color] filled with interesting personalities and reality-shattering shenanigans.  God help me but I love it...  

The thing itself is a neat distillation of [thing=463]Magic[/thing]'s higher points (though without the attendant depth) of art/world/story, deck building, and the chaining of ridiculous combos.  As a deckbuilder it's the quick-fix version of touching those nubbins in all the ways [thing=36218]Dominion[/thing] doesn't.

As a screen-time noodler it's like someone used my skull as a Play-Doh® Fuzzy Pumper Barber Shop™ to squeeze a wad of Solitaire and this is what came curling out of my head holes.

This was one of the first games I got after getting into games a few years ago, and it remains a favourite. Not very deep, but for those nights when I want to enjoy a lighter game, I break out Ascension. The cards in our copy are very well worn, that's how often we've played it. Everyone I've introduced it to, both gamers and non-gamers, has enjoyed it, as well. I also like that it's easy to teach.

I passed on this at first, 'cos I felt like I got burned on Thunderstone, and was wary of another deck-building monster-fighter. I didn't like the way that TS said that you were engaging in combat, when really you were just buying monsters using a cludgy formula.

In Ascension, you're also buying monsters (with attack rating "currency"), but it doesn't bother me nearly as much. A lot of that has to do with the lack of cludge, but it might also be 'cos you're simply "defeating" monsters; the lack of combat pretense sits better with me. Then, the results of monster-fighting are just more interesting; their secondary powers make for some good tactical decision-making.

All in all, it's fast, it's fun, and I'm glad I gave it a chance.

A great game, for a TCG player like myself. A lot of people are comparing this game to Dominion. The game follow the same rules basically but they are completely different games. It is like comparing apples to oranges, some say that there is less strategy in this game that there is in Dominion. Dominion requires premeditation prior to the start of the game you should decided what combination you will want to play, and that part does not really change as the game goes along because noone can really stop you. In Ascension it is the opposite, you can really only play around what you get.

It becomes a matter of taste, I like Ascension more because you have to change and adapt the situation at hand, you can stop other players from buy/defeating the larger cards on the board as well, it feel more interactive.

Another note to have is that Dominion has several expansions ahead of Ascension, if you take the base set of Dominion and play with it, its really not the best... A strong strategy is to just buy gold and buy the larger and better items and just win, it felt like a solitaire game really, the future expansions then fixed that with cards like Pirate Ship (which i hate). Ascension will have expansions to follow and Im sure they will address their issues that people have with the game.

A bit more random than I'd like.  When I first played this, I thought that the lack of limits on how many cards you play and/or buy on your turn was a good thing.  After playing several more times, though, I've reached the conclusion that all it does is remove the need to make choices - you almost certainly play everything in your hand (things that might banish cards from your hand are an exception), and all that matters is what order you play them in, and sometimes even that doesn't matter.  In Dominion, you had to carefully manage how many actions you bought for your deck, and find a way to play more actions per turn if you were going to need them.  You also had to make a choice about when to buy your victory points.  Ascension doesn't require you to pay any attention to that sort of thing - you just buy the best things you can each turn because you'll always be able to play them all.  Cards you're buying only for their victory point values are almost always relics that you can try to keep out of your deck.  It just feels like a game with fewer meaningful choices than Dominion.

RATING: 4
It's supposedly a card drafting game, but your limited choices are quite random, your hand is random, and some cards are just far better value than others.  There is little synergy between cards, and what there is rarely matters because its too specific.  Can you collect card A and card B, and then get them in your hand before the game is over?  Not likely, especially since your deck just keeps growing in size.  You pretty much must buy cards whenever possible because they are all worth victory points.  A "lean and mean" deck, constructed with thought and careful focus, just doesn't happen.  Not much fun with 2 players and a whole lot worse with 4.

RATING: 6
While I enjoyed this more than other Dominion knock-offs (that means YOU, Thunderstone!), there isn't much to it. It's hard to plan card combos ahead of time, since the cards come out randomly over the course of the game. This is somewhat ameliorated by the fact that there aren't as many different cards, but that lowers the depth and the replay value.  The game was mildly entertaining, but felt somewhat mindless, and I'm not sure I'd want to play it very often. (1 play)

RATING: 10
"Ascension" is (one of) the best deck-builders ever created, and the one that coined the constantly evolving in game card market system, which makes every game extremely dynamic & tactical. The game universe is unique, twisted, and dark, but has a particular charm to it. The game is very simple to learn and it's incredibly addictive! Gameplay is very streamlined & balanced. Get the app to learn playing it, but do yourself a favour and buy a physical copy, for the full experience!

I was aware of this game for a long time, but refused to buy it because of the horrific artwork. Finally, a friend convinced me to play it once. I'm glad I did, because mechanically it's an excellent game. I just wish that artwork wasn't so ridiculously bad! You can literally see the lines from the college ruled notebook paper these things were sketched onto!

A fast paced domi game.

Sometimes the main deck is not shuffled well so all cards on the table are monsters/heroes. It definitely benefits some deck and harms others. It will be good if a mechanism which can solve this problem can be introduced.

I love the artwork - but some people hate it. I find it amusingly similar to how old Magic cards used to look.

As for the game itself - it's good, but gets way better if you expand the middle row of cards from 6 to 12. I was so surprised how much better the game becomes after you do that.

Aug10:

Need some more plays to really cement my feelings.  But the demo was enough to get me to buy it.

It's not *better* than Dominion, but it's plenty good enough and different.

I really like the reduced setup time.  And I like how they did very well with the iconography and the streamlined rules (And lack of exceptions)

You can really combo out on your turn, and I don't think I'd want to play with 4-players, but with 2 or 3 I think you could have some control.

The factions seemed balanced, and there was enough playtesting done I have some faith of this.

And really, it just looks cool!

You can't precisely plan ahead since the available pool fluctuates.  But like RftG, there are "types" of cards and you can be fairly certain that those "types" will appear at some point.

A deck building game somewhat in the fashion of Dominion, mostly notable for its award-winning, top-of-the-class iOS implementation. The title and fantasy theme are pretty silly, and the artwork is much maligned; but I think the artwork is actually rather pretty if unconventional for the fantasy genre.

I got a lot of play out of this, but in retrospect there’s not much to it; there’s some tactical play but the strategies are fairly obvious, and luck is a huge factor. I’d probably have rated it 9 at first but 7 now, so let’s say 8.

It's hard to craft a strategy when you don't know what cards will be available to purchase later in the game. Some things are definitely better than others, but you're mostly at the mercy of the tableau. It's fun as a 2-player filler when playing multiple games, but there's too much downtime in a 4-player game, and the game isn't strategic enough to make you think during it.

Singular function cards(Apprentice/Mystic & Militia/Heavy Infantry) combined with the randomly generated center row create too many turns where your strategy did not match up with probabilities, and can lead to a snowball problem.

Breezy deck building game.  The green cards seem obviously superior to everything else with a ton of "Draw X" effects coupled with other ridiculous abilities like free victory points.  This is a game I'll play when requested if only because a typical game with three to four people takes 20 minutes at most.

Same basic game as Apprentice Edition, which I really like.  Components are nice, including a nice board and clear plastic gems for honor counters.  The box has enough room to store the apprentice edition (redundant I know, but there's extra room in the box for some promos and such is my point).  Rules for solitaire are included.

Finally played this in 2014 (had very little interest), a few notes: 

- Reminded me the most of Thunderstone
- WAY too few cards, kept seeing the same ones even after 2 or 3 games, and all too similar
- Like other DBG's, decisions too few and obvious
- Having variable market adds big luck element
- Did not seem to be enough Monsters
- Did not seem to be enough cards to clear market cards, too many cards got 'stuck' in market

To me, pure DBG's are boring as they don't offer enough interesting decisions, this is no exception, after 3 games I was totally done here literally nothing left to explore without expansions. Games like Mageknight, Few Acres and others show that deck building is an excellent feature in a game and really puts just pure DB games to shame imho.  

--------
Another Dominion clone, this is the year of "them". 

Theme is supposed to be a little better only, is the gameplay any more engaging though?  Dominion really did not keep my interest at all, its a pure deck build with one main decision on timing and nothing else which I found not that interesting.

I love ascension because it is easy to set-up, easy to learn, plays quickly, and is lots of fun.

There is a bit of luck in the cards that are available to you or in the distribution of money/military each round. It sucks when your opponent gets his engine running and you are struggling with crap cards. Like I said, the game plays quick so chances are you will be the one running through your deck next game.

I would prefer to trade my 3 Ascension sets together, if possible.
I do not have the original boxes or rule books for these, but every card from all three sets is included as well as the Rat King promo. All the cards and the board from Rise of Vigil are in a 1600-count card storage box with plenty of room to spare. I'd be happy to send a pic of how I have the cards stored, if interested. I'm happy to include 300 Ultra-Pro Black Matte sleeves (the majority of which have never been used), which is far more than is needed for the game.

This game was considered "a break" from games like Dominion and Thunderstone, but lately has become the preferred game among our "deck building" genre games. The strategy seems lost on the randomness of cards available at first - but then becomes the very reason the game succeeds. After learning the cards, and figuring out successful strategies, it seemingly becomes more dynamic than Dominion, as it forces players to have to adapt strategy throughout the game rather than the static strategy of Dominion. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Ascension is a more tactical take on Dominion, but it always feels more like a guessing game where I attempt to figure out early on whether Runes or Power is the currency that is more likely to win me the game. The rest of the game mechanics, including trying to combine Faction powers, fade to the background.

I'll play it, but I'd rather play Dominion.

A deck-building game.  Since Dominion is one of my favorite games, I naturally evaluate this game through the lens of Dominion.  Ascension seems much more luck-based than Dominion, since you have a limited selection of cards to purchase or defeat, and the selection changes constantly.  It also has a two-tier resource system: some cards give you runes to purchase heroes and artifacts and some give you fight ability to defeat monsters.  Cards are worth points (except your starting cards), and you can also take actions to collect the equivalent of Dominion's VP tokens.  The supply of those is limited in a way very similar to the way the victory tokens in Race for the Galaxy is limited, including it being an end-game trigger.  All in all, it's kind of fun and I wouldn't mind playing it again, but mostly I'll play Dominion instead.

A non-collectable deck building game with a quicker set-up time, larger random factor, more than twice as many types of card and more chance for thwarting opponents than Dominion.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (February 2013)

Good light game. I know I’m in the minority here, but I LOVE the art. The theme is also nice although I don’t feel it when I’m playing. Ascension is a very easy game to learn and teach, you need to buy cards and/or kill cards, no more. Also it plays very quick.

Unfortunately, the game is not very deep, which can be an advantage if you are playing with your non-gaming friends or want to play something light. I will look into the expansions soon, but for now Dominion continues to be king for me. Also this game has a critical flaw (for me), the central tableau is changing and every turn each player has different opportunities to buy or attack something. I dislike this because it is NOT FAIR and adds a ton of luck. That fact alone leaves the rating at 6.0. Other deck building games “guilty” of this flaw are: Resident Evil, Thunderstone and Legendary. I prefer games like Dominion, in which every player has the same shot at buying a particular card. 

Ascension is best with 2 players, but I will play any number of players.

Bottom line, I wasn’t expecting a good game, and I was surprised. For the time being I enjoy playing Ascension, but I feel that I will know all that there is to know pretty soon, so I will have to add some expansion to the mix. Also (for now) I prefer to play Ascension over Thunderstone.

Current Rating: 6.0

RATING: 5
Ascension is to Dominion/Thunderstone what Magic Limited is to Constructed.

It isn't that simple a comparison for me though.  I loved Limited formats in Magic because the card base for each set was huge, and there was a wealth of great decisions to be made all the way down the draft.  If I'm going to criticize the CCG format for being too expensive to play regularly, I have to give it credit for providing the massive variety that doesn't exist in an out-of-the-box game like Ascension.

It's harsh to compare Ascension to one of the best games ever though.  This is a decent game in its own right, and holds its own among the growing set of deckbuilding games.  I'd like to play it another few times, but I can already see myself growing bored with it.  Probably not for purchase.

Edit:  I'm a little more skeptical of Ascension after a second play.  Many of the "decisions" seem obvious and it's troublesome that there's so much randomness in who gets early Void cards, for example.

Interesting approach to deckbuilding—one common pile of cards with a random set to purchase each round, making setup and teardown very quick but also making the game much more randomized. I wasn't a fan of the artwork and traded it away.

RATING: 6
Got it on the iPad. Was OK when it was still fresh. But it got stale very quickly. The fact that only 6 cards (besides the 3 constants) were available for "purchase" and that these 6 cards could vary wildly from one type to another made this game a little too random for my liking. Decisions are usually logical and do not allow for much "clever"/unpredictable play. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I feel like this is a better deckbuilder two player than Dominion, but with more players it gets a bit ridiculous and can take a while. There's a lot less strategy with 3 players as you're mostly hoping for random chance.

I also feel like the mech cards weren't properly implemented. Aside from being a lot of points at the end, they're incredibly situational and might not be relevant at all during the game. This is the case with a lot of cards. You can build attack up, but if there aren't any monsters later in the game then you're likely going to lose.

2014-02-15 - This is a pretty good deck builder. When I first played it, I really didn't like the randomness of it. And I still much prefer the set market of Dominion, but I have come around on this game. It's more tactical than Dominion, and it has some great mechanisms. The theme is definitely stronger than Dominion's, too.

2017-11-06 - I kind of got lost in the shuffle of expansions for this one. The endless, ridiculous combos that are possible now pretty much soured me on the game. I doubt I'll play it again.

RATING: 9
A tactical deck-building game of acquiring increasingly useful cards while ultimately accumulating honor tokens/points.  It quickly becomes obvious as to which cards are worthy of acquiring and not (draw cards).  I'm enjoying the calculated efficiency of the iPad version for now.  Card text familiarity is a must.

UPDATE:  Just purchased the hard copy as well and sleeved the cards with Mayday 2 1/2 x 3 1/2 (MDG-7041) 

Expansions owned:
Return of the Fallen
Storm of Souls

Promos:
Rat King
Leprechaun

Ascension has a lot of similarities to Dominion. I like that there is more to do in Ascension but I'm not too fond of the theme or setting for some reason. Still very fun to play though!

RATING: 5
Another deck-builder. Rather than having a "town" area, Ascension uses a draw pile with 5 or 6 face up cards to either purchase or defeat. This adds another layer of randomness and chaos, but for all that it's still a fun, lighter deck-builder with combat. I don't think it makes the cut for me, though, as a deck-builder I want to own.

RATING: 9
Yet another deckbuilding game, with poor presentation and such a simple rulebook, it is difficult to market/get into. First impression of this game was bad. At first, its only redeeming quality seems to be the fast setup time.

However, the depth of the game only comes after multiple plays, which is only possible in a short time when played on the iPad (5 mins or less per game). After the "next level" of comprehension is reached, this game becomes addictive as you try to compute the most optimal path based on the current situation.

Playing with 2p is a must, will not play it seriously any other way.

I only ever play on the app, and I prefer it that way.  With so many different card combinations and ways to accumulate (Gold and Red - whatever they're called) the numbers to acquire more cards and/or defeat enemies, I'm glad there is a machine that does the computing for me!

Ascension is the most consistently fun card/board game I've played in the last several years. It has a balance of chance and skill that rewards experienced players while remaining something that new and casual gamers can enjoy. I've played this literally hundreds of times thanks to the iOS version, and it always holds my attention. The advantage of the physical version is customizability: being able to tweak the card pool is very fun for anyone who fancies himself a game designer, as subtle choices can have a major impact on gameplay.

I am a little conflicted on what to rate this game. On one hand I absolutely love the ios implementation. On the other, I think I would be bored to tears by the physical game because it won't play as quickly. I no longer think it's a great game because I think i've played it too much and figured it out. So while I will still play the ios game frequently I no longer really like the game if that makes any sense. Proceed with caution.

Ascension's contribution to deckbuilding is the random central display of available cards, later to be implemented successfully in Star Realms or Legendary. With this, it was the first quick tactical deckbuilder. Nonetheless, its main success only came with the iOS version. It's among my favorite deckbuilders, avoiding Dominion's strategic trap of simply executing an initial strategy consisting in annoying deck-thinning or action-chaining as well as Thunderstone's potentially too long games.

Compared with its successor in spirit, Star Realms, the factions aren't that differentiated yet, the combo building is not as obvious and massive. The fantasy setting is a bit offbeat and charmingly independent although I'm in the minority with this view as it's mostly considered to be hideous.

Juego de deck-building con un pool de cartas aleatorio que se va renovando durante la partida. La otra novedad respecto Dominion son dos tipos de recursos: runas para "comprar" héroes y fuerza para derrotar monstruos. Es rápido y entretenido, pero muy dependiente de la suerte.

I used to be hugely into Magic: The Gathering, and Ascension tickles the same area of my brain that Magic did. It's easy to set up, easy to teach, and quick to play. It's one of my favorite games of all time. The only thing that prevents it being a solid 10 is that the iPad and iPhone version is so good you almost don't need the real card game.

Played with 4 players. Feel like a tactical Deck-Builder which you can't really plan ahead for anything. Your options are fairly limited each turn, so it is really not that hard to figure out what is best for you. There is also not much player interaction either, only occasionally certain cards appear which do rather minimal damage to other player.

This game is ok.  But there are so many better deck-builders out there.  Still, it's a nice quick distraction.  Will definately play again.  Art-work is not really my style.  This game is not as enjoyable as Thunderstone (though quicker!).  And doesn't even hold a candle to BarbaRossa.  Good filler, I guess.

This game is too short for all player counts. As a result, it becomes subject to what cards come out when. It becomes impossible to consistently establish your engine. I have played close to 1000 games on the app with 3 players at 120-135 honor, and I win over 95% of the time. With 3 players at the suggested 75 honor, it's closer to 33%

2) Legendary - unless you don't like the whole superhero theme, it should be easier to get people to the table and allows for a lot of depth through expansions. Also allows for either cooperative or competitive play which is a great. Just a slightly better game.

I know I'm probably alone on this, but the fantasy theme does nothing for me.  I'm not sure there's any way to evaluate this game without comparing it to Dominion, and Dominion prevails in every way except for setup time.  

In comparison to Thunderstone, I like that this is simpler, if I had to compare the two I probably prefer this one.

I don't like the changing card layout, which adds a pretty heavy luck element in to the game.  But the main problem I have with the game is the lack of story arc.  I don't know if it's because we were playing wrong, but there was no momentum as we approached the endgame.  It didn't get any faster, the tension did not increase, we just kind of kept doing the same thing over and over again until the endgame conditions were reached.  I'd be willing to try this again to see if it improves, but I'm pretty disappointed.

Update - December 2011
I could have done this a couple months back, but the iPad version of this game completely reversed my opinion.  Getting to know the cards and system better sold me on the game.  Plus the fact that you can play a game in 5 minutes convinced me that this really is a lot of fun.  Because of my change of heart I've had to re-evaluate my approach to deckbuilders in general.  I can't wait for the Thunderstone iOS app, because that was another that I probably didn't give a fair shake.

Up to a 9.

Very simple, light Dominion game. Unlike other copycats (e.g. Thunderstone) who complicate and destroy the elegance of Dominion, this game provides an alternative way to play it. And I really enjoy it.

Even easier to explain than Dominion and probably easier to expand upon due to the way the center row cards are filled up. This game fixes a problem I had with Dom, which is that every player can build the exact same deck as another player.

RATING: 7
A game by MtG players for MtG players, borrowing heavily from Dominion. Not so strategic, but a rather tactical game in comparison with Dominion, because of the card pool that functions in a very different way. This is also more thematic than Dominion and contains a lot better art that reminds me a bit of early MtG. I like Dominion better, but this one is definitely better than Thunderstone, which is even more thematic. Also, like Dominion again, this really benefits from adding the expansions. Best played as a 2-player game. The solo option is not super challenging, but requires a very different mindset from playing against a real person as you have to focus much more on controlling the center row than the card advantage.

Fast paced game, barely any set-up, best with 2. This is a superbly basic game, which anyone can play, but it still brought a few twists to deckbuilding: dual-resources, factions, cards that stay in play.

Nice deckbuilder, but where Dominion is all about straetgy, this is about tactical play. You don't know which cards will be in play until they are revealed and with usually only one of each available at a time you can't really count on getting them unless they are revealed in your turn and you happen to have the right cards to pay for them. Still fun, but I wouldn't go out of my way to play it again.

Meh. A mediocre deck builder. One of the largest drawbacks of this one to me is the art. Poor is an understatement. It looks as if they either decided to do it themselves or hire kids to do it to save money. I would be embarrassed to present this as a finished product. The mechanisms are just fine - I just can't get past the bad art card after card, after card...

サンダーストーンの英雄の方が、アセンションのヒーローよりも、らしさで優る。だから、サンダーストーンの方が好きだな。

Ascension on the other hand streamlines the rules to a point where anyone with a passing knowledge of board games or CCG's can learn the game rapidly but they brought over the complexities and changing challenges from the Magic Pro Tour scene and I think it works wonderfully.  You need to strategize but constantly re-evaluate your decisions as the cards available change constantly.  You also have to consider what your opponents can and cannot handle on the board - if there's something they want it may be worth purchasing something you don't want if it would help them - or leaving something you may want so you don't bring up anything new.

Un de mes jeux préférés! Règles simple (Ma copine qui est effrayé par les jeux genre Magic s'éclate à me mettre des branlées sur ce jeu, j'aime à penser que c'est le début de l'apprentissage de Magic... et Netrunner?...), dès qu'on a pris le plis, les parties sont rapides et il est toujours plaisant de voir l'autre rager par ce qu'on vient de se procurer une carte qu'il convoitait. 
Si je ne lui mets pas 10 étoiles c'est par ce que je trouve qu'on ne pourrit pas assez le jeu de l'adversaire (ce qui semble résolu dans l'extension: Gifts of Element) et que l'interaction entre les joueurs est un peu trop rare à mon goût.
Mais Ascension n'en est pas moins un excellent jeu à mes yeux.

Tries very hard to be thematic and fantastic without achieving either very well. Card artwork makes the effort but doesn't quite make the cut, though graphic design is not bad.

Not as polished or deep as Dominion, but probably more successful overall than Thunderstone - too derivative to win points for innovation.

The 7 rating might go  down as I feel there was a lot of luck in the game. More so than in other deckbuilders Ihave played.

after buying the ios app my rating goes up to an 8. we misplayed the monster that returns from the void. you can defeat it multiple times in a turn.

Another fantasy-themed Dominion clone. Not as slow and clunky as Thunderstone. The iOS app gets played occasionally, takes only a few minutes per game, but I wouldn't bother setting the actual game up. Feels too easy and random, decisions are usually trivial and some of the base set cards are wildly unbalanced. Still an ok quick casual game on the iOS.

RATING: 6.5
I can't help but compare this to Dominion.

First of all, the theme is better. Rather than building an empire that you can't see grow (only your deck gets bigger), you recruit heros and build artifacts that come to your aid.

Unlike Dominion, this game does not have "VP cards" that don't do anything else. Dominion's mechanic of "don't buy too many VPs or your ability cards will dilute" was clever, but it was always disappointing to draw VP cards.

Ascension has a go-to way to get points (Cultist). Additionally, the game's best feature is that you can combat monsters, which give you immediate rewards and are removed from play rather than going to your deck for some bonuses later.

Where Ascension falls short is its rulebook, which omits certain rules of play (when do Center Row cards get replaced? How can you divvy power? Can you really kill multiple Cultists?), and that the Cultist card is a bit too exploitable. Killing these multiple times in one turn is an efficient way to make many points.

Also there's something to be said about the card art, most of which seriously looks like it was drawn with colored pencils onto ruled notebook paper.

Played twice, 3 & 4 players.  Better than I expected.  Yes, this is another Dominion inspired deck building game, but there are far fewer card interactions, setup is much quicker, and a game plays much quicker.  Sleeves are necessary (of course).  After enough games, though, you will find that the game devolves into one of two general situations:  either the center row is clogged with cards that nobody can afford to buy, or monsters that nobody can destroy.  When this happens, the game loses quite a bit of its fun, and settles into a race to the end.

RATING: 6
The newest and simplest of the deck building games (Dominion, Thunderstone) with pretty unique and interesting art.  Plays decently with minimal preparation (less than the 2 others).  With less strategy and more tactics, it's an easy sell to most TCG players.  I'm not sure you need this if you have Dominion & Thunderstone.  More random, less balanced.

RATING: 3
After a video review

Very simple deck building game that does not match rune age for me. Same problem than legendary where the cards in the middle change all the time. Very annoying because you cannot plan strategy ahead and you constantly need to read new cards.

The objectives are also pretty dull. So it's more a game when you build a deck to build a deck.

After playing the app

Very boring game with no objective. The game play could be summarized as: buy cards, to buy cards, to buy more cards to ... oh! wait I can kill a monster and get resources to buy even more cards. Entirely boring, it's deck building for deck building.

As a comparative, in "Star Realms", you build a deck to destroy your opponent, so you have a clear goal to achieve, here you just build your deck until all the points are distributed. Sure you can kill monsters, but most of the time, there are no monsters to kill and you end up killing dozens of cultist instead.

Now compared to Star Realm, the card interaction is much more complex and you can build powerful combo, I managed for example to play 11 cards when normally you play only 5. But it does not feel rewarding to build such combos because there is no good reason to do so. In fact, I ended up killing 8 cultists because there was nothing else to kill

I imagine people who like complex card combo would like this, else I don't see much to this game.

This rating is purely based on the IPad version of the game to which I have become a bit addicted.  Haven't yet started playing opponents online as I wanted to get to know the cards better first, but I can understand where people have a hard time playing deckbuilders with a hard copy once they've started playing it via software!  

AI is fairly easy to beat with the base version thus far. The easiest level is no contest and I usually cream the AI by 30-40 points.  The next level up the AI is more challenging but I am still winning 85% of my games, just by 5-15 points now.  

I am not a fan of the 4-1 card draws that can and often do occur early in the game though.

**iPhone Version Only**
**Solo Play Only**

I purchased this for my iphone after hearing some many great things about it. I am a Thunderstone fan through and through, but if I had to have any other deck building game out there it would be this one. The world that is created is unique, and unlike in Thundestone you really get down to individual level with the characters and monsters. Whereas in Thunderstone you are bulding up this huge army where you don't know one soldier from the next, in Ascension you feel like you are building up a questing party, with a few tag-alongs. The iOS version is great and has a great tutorial that got me up and playing solo in minutes (and it is a great price too). The Rat King Promo is a must for anyone using playing this digitally.

Fun with nice artwork. However might be too random for me, especially since the offer turns over so quickly. Hard to develop and stick to a strategy, like you can in Dominion. Need more plays, with other expansions/stand-alone decks, and no more than 3p.

While the great deckbuilding game hasn’t been created yet (sorry Dominion fans), Ascension:Chronicle of the Godslayer is a good step in the right direction. It plays quite quickly (if a bit slower than Dominion) and it trades off some luck in exchange for fun, meaningful decisions throughout the game and a purpose beyond fiddling with cards (namely, defeating monsters).

The result is a fun, yet flawed game that I’ve played more than a dozen times face-to-face plus any number of games via the iOS app. It’s starting to wear a bit thin now (I haven’t gotten to check out the expansion yet), but I’m happy with it.

It avoids the two largest traps Dominion fell into: frontloading all of the interesting decisions and making the game about nothing more than fiddling with the cards. The former it cures with the randomly drawn tableau, and it comes at the price of a healthy dose of luck – if the right card is drawn right before your turn you can be off to the races and having a hand tilted toward runes when it’s all monsters available (or vice versa) is a bummer. Also, there is a mild-to-moderate rich-get-richer problem since lucky breaks make it easier to take advantage of subsequent lucky breaks. It’s not so bad with more players, since there is a higher chance that another player has the luck and tools to keep up, but being left behind is no fun.

Since it’s hard to win the game without defeating some significant monsters along the way, your focus is not just on acquiring card which help you acquire more cards. This secondary note gives the game more variability than Dominion and is welcome. While Ascension still suffers from long turns caused by deck-churning combos, they do not seem to reach the epic proportions of Dominion’s worst excesses.

I think Ascension would have been better with separate monster and “runes” decks and tableaus, so both paths are always viable. Also, the economies of scale for paying higher prices are a little out of whack, since the designers and developers did not seem to take into account the value of getting an effect using a single card in hand versus relying on multiple cards in hand. Nevertheless, there are enough viable strategies, and the factions have enough distinct flavour, to keep the game worth exploring for many plays.

This is definitely a game that does better in the lower player counts. With 4 the central row of cards to buy and fight change so much between one of your turns to the next that it is difficult to create a deck with cohesive synergies. I liked that almost every card gave you some VPs so that you didn't have to buy straight up VP cards. I would also like that there is always at the very least a cultist, mystic and heavy infantry to buy/beat up if it didn't seem like they were sometimes necessary for the game to work well. Finally the constructs I find pretty neat. 

However I am biased towards deck builders that have pre existing stacks for you to buy from rather than an ever changing one, and even in the dynamic card market I prefer Legendary since the heroes you can recruit changes each game there are also schemes.

EDIT after playing this over a hundred times against the  app AI: As always I find deckbuilders really addicting, but this one has so many flaws. I really think this game should havr considered having both money buy row and an attack buy row, as the difference between not having something to buy/attack in the center row and having a good option is pretty swingy. This is exacerbated by the fact there are very few center row scrappers in the game. 

Constructs are prototype-level in terms of execution and were much improved through Star Realms's bases. The inconsistency in when you have the ability to destroy your opponent's constructs can make them insanely powerful or near useless.

While there is non-static time-dependent value in terms of certain cards being worth more/less depending on how early/late the game is, that is also true for games with static setups, and here the lack of cards that combo with other cards make them have very static game-to-game value.

The mystics, heavy militia, and cultists are there more out of necessity to prevent the game from becoming degenerate than as an interesting option.

The main reason that I think this game is overrated is that I got spoiled with the app. I refuse to play this in person anymore but do like playing the AIs. My three biggest complaints about this game are:
-	Randomness can make or break people. I’ve seen people win and lose almost exclusively because of the cards that hit the table from the draw pile. It doesn’t happen very often (maybe 10% of the time), but any game that is that swingy is frustrating to me. And if you’re playing on the app, you can just start a new game.
-	It’s so freaking slow in person. I think the variety of cards and possible strategies just amplify AP potential.
-	The art is *almost* worse than Dominion.

I really wanted to like this, but after many plays, it's not to be. I like that games are very quick, but on the down side, your choices are hugely affected by randomness (whatever is available in the center row). In many games it doesn't matter what do you, you'll get great or horrible cards.

This one actually has quite a bit in common with Dominion and Thunderstone with some major differences:

- Multiple buys allowed in a round
- Multiple combats allowed in a round
- Randomized row of six cards available for purchase
- 3 Standard cards always available
- Row refills immediately following combat and purchases

It's much less predictable and strategic than Dominion but plays with the same light feel and fast pace. It also remains VERY COMBOLICIOUS.

I'll be excited to see where they take this system next.

There is very little good to say about Ascension.  Obviously, it has a tough act to follow with Dominion.  However, other perfectly good games managed to make a distinctive splash (Rune Age, Core Worlds, Trains).  Ascension lacks any cohesive deck construction strategy; combos that arise are accidental at best, and there is never any question of how to play your hand.  The shifting center row seems like a good idea if you're bored of the static ten stacks Dominion offers, but it is implemented poorly; Ticket to Ride had a better implemented center row.  In the end, I can't imagine choosing this game over any other deck builder or card game.

DECK BUILDING.  This has turned out to be a great addition to my collection.  It's nice that you can just play with a random collection of 100 or 200 cards and have some truly dynamic games.  I look forward to collecting expansions.

It's lighter than Dominion.  Well, the base set that I have is about the equivalent of the base set of Dominion.  I have no idea what the expansions are like yet.

Played a bunch of times.

Ken:
A fun alternative to Dominion which offers multiple currencies, a fantastical theme, and more immediate gameplay.  Questionable choice in art direction.  Highly tactical and reactive in nature, as opposed to the more general strategic "deck-building" style seen in other titles.  After a few plays, the easier setup and colorful (yet, like Dominion, poorly integrated) theme could not appeal more than Dominion's deeper play.

Would be willing to play again.  No chance of future re-acquisition.

Kathleen:
I liked this - it was Dominion with a purpose.  The random tactical nature of the game appealed.  I feel like I would be happy to play it again, but yet, we have Dominion, so I don't think Ascension is needed.  I prefer the aesthetic design of Dominion, and the high variety in available cards.  The more set nature of each turn in Dominion is also better than the loosey-goosey structure of turns in Ascension.

Rating an 8 after playing once.  I really liked it.  I like the randomness.  I like the simplicity.  So quick to set up, to teach, and to play.  People complain about the art but I like it.  The board isn't necessary but I like having it.  The box is perfect. Fits everything perfectly even with sleeves.  Hopefully it'll hold up after a few more plays but I have a strong feeling it will.  

UPDATE:  I enjoy this game more with each play.  I prefer it over Dominion simply b/c it is so quick to set up and play.  Setting up Dominion has become a chore in itself.  I like the fantasy theme and just the overall gameplay.  Great game.  

Up for trade because I never get to play it anymore.

Base set has been sleeved in Ascension sleeves and in Ascension box w/ dividers.  Original box is stored away.

3/2011 Very good first impressions.  Ascension is a simpler deckbuilding 'board game' where drafting is a central game element compared to Dominion, Thunderstone and its like.  Game play seems ideal for 2 players, maybe 3 but not with 4 players as in my first game; there were quite some downtime.

It's entertaining in a very casual way, and works overall fairly well.

However, it is quite random, and so much in fact, that it is hard to get one of the obvious strategies going - often you just resort to doing what's possible.
And the artwork is not consistently good, somewhat on the cards (but there is a choice of style in there too), but especially on the board, which is muddy and ugly. The only really good artwork is the box and title.
I hope they will add a better designed board in some expansion.

We play it when we don't care who wins anyway :-)

A badly crafted attempt to capitalize the "deckbuilding mania" that invested the gaming world after Dominion.

Added to my collection in October 2010. First played in October 2010.

I'm afraid that I'm not very keen on the art for the game. It feels like very early Magic art and I'm not a fan.

Game play wise, I have only played it once but initial observations are good. In fact, I sold another copy to my opponent.

Initial rating after one 2 player game: A steady 7.

Update: December 2010. I think that while I enjoy Ascension as a break from Dominion or Thunderstone, it can't compete with the overall quality of the other two games. However, it is far more portable and easier to play at events than any other deck building game that I have tried. Initial rating of 7 is about right.

RATING: 8
Judging solely from a couple of two-played games, Ascension appears to be a more successful variation of Dominion’s groundwork than Thunderstone, especially since it heeds to its ancestors lesson about the importance of clean design and good development. Although the ever-changing variety of cards available to purchase or kill suggests more chaos and less strategy, the correlation of the four factions with specific capabilities makes planning worthwhile. We’ll see how this holds up for three or four players.

The biggest difference to other deckbuilding games is probably less the cycling card pool, but the ability to kill or buy several cards at once in any order you want. This opens up a couple of tactical options and is done deftly enough to be relatively hassle-free.

Themewise, having a more exotic background than the routine fantasy world was a good decision, as was handing the illustration work to a single artist – even though only a few individual pieces of art really succeed for me, having a coherent vision for the whole game is a huge benefit.

Other games do this so much better.  Just play each hand the best you can and you will be okay.  I've only played 3 times and I always play against players with over a thousand plays.

The choices are painfully obvious - just buy the best available card and defeat the strongest enemy, if you can. In essence the game plays you, when it should be the other way round. No real challenge, no real interaction, just endless card-shuffling. It could very easily simulated - no real A.I. needed - for an iPad or an android tablet (I think that this is already be done?).

At least it plays fast, so it's not a total waste of time. Maybe, the expansions fix some of the problems, but I am not sure I want to try them. 

I realy like the artwork.

Of all of the recent deck building games, this one seems to be one of the better ones. I enjoy the intricacies of the different factions and how each game changes as new cards are put in the middle.

Only bad thing maybe is that there is no real interaction with the other players...it's a race to the most VPs... but it is fun.

Deckbuilding game with awful artwork that has a lot of mechanics from Dominion, but includes two currencies and monsters to defeat. Quite straightforward and streamlined, and you can set up some nice combos. Strategy is quite subtle, compared with Dominion (which I feel is cleaner and clearer what is going on and what you need to do). Includes Rat King promo.

RATING: 8.2
Interesting deck builder.  The mechanics are solid and simple.  The game is more tactical than strategic, thus giving you significant choices to make every turn.

So now for the Dominion comparison.  I came to this game after almost 700 plays of Dominion (through Hinterlands expansion), which is my standard for in-game deck builders (e.g., I'm not comparing this to SWCCG).  In Dominion, you check out the 10 kingdom cards and for the most part can plan out your deck right then and there, although sometimes your decisions will depend on what others buy.  In Ascension, all your decisions depend on those center cards and what the other players are buying/defeating. [i]Of course[/i], that being the case, it tends to be more luck-driven than Dominion, and it can be frustrating to feel like you can never make it to 6 runes for the good cards while your opponent picks them all up--but such is the nature of luck!  Anyway, it's a fun twist on the deck building concept, and I'm glad it's not just a total Dominion clone.  

As in Dominion, I love the simple rule set.  

I think the theme will probably turn off more people than Dominion's low-key medieval theme, but I like it.  I also like the artwork style.  Don't get me wrong:  Some of the cards are freakishly ugly, but thematically they all mesh together very well.  Here again, I'm happy for the game to be distinctly visually separate from Dominion.

However, I don't think I'll get anywhere close to 700 plays of this one, since the center deck is the same each time.  Still, maybe I'll get to 100? (I suppose if I buy the expansions I'll get more mileage out of it.)  

Overall, it's an enjoyable game and I'm glad I bought it.  I'd certainly recommend it to people who enjoy in-game deck building, as I do.

NOTE:  Have played many IOS games now.  I don't log them on BGG.

The artwork in this game is hideous. We like the game itself enough that we're keeping it, but wow, it's ugly.

We like it better than Dominion for one simple reason--there's a constantly changing row of cards to buy from. For us, that's more fun than when all the cards that will be in the game are out and available for sale from the start.

I really enjoy this game (at least as an iPad app) but it seems to have very little control. It almost strikes me as an experience game, as you are just trying to make do with what you have. And a bad string of draws in multiplayer games can leave you with very little to do. Still, it is fun and fast.

Owned the iPad version.  More tactical and less strategic than Dominion. Not as deep, but has some re-playability due to the variety of cards.  It's fairly quick and easy to get into. I prefer it with 2 or 3.  4 is ok and I would never consider 5 or 6 (only with expansion).  The components are nice but the artwork is not my favorite.  It's a nice concept, but just lacks a little something to make it great.

Our first play made us doubt this game. I ended up with so many 'draw 2' and 'draw 3' cards that I was almost drawing my whole deck each turn. The experience was not fun. We then removed the 'draw 3' card from the deck and are enjoying it, although in a more mellow manner than Rise of Vigil, whose theme we are more attracted to.

I read about this game a couple years ago, but dismissed it quickly as a Magic CCG clone, then forget about it. I saw it played at Essen last year, and it looked interesting. Briefly read about it again here at BGG and dismissed it again as that old Magic clone (and Dominion clone).

Also I didn't like the dark color and style of the boxes. I saw the new box Rise of Vigil advertised recently, and liked the blue ćolor. This time I read the rules and reviews carefully.

Solo play and the art is a 9 rating. After a two player game I would give it slightly lower rating. Big monsters clogged up the central row.

Deckbuilders still don't really do it for me. There's some nice synergies in this one, and I appreciate the fact that you don't have to re-digest the text of multiple possible cards on every set up. But strategy seems limited and interaction is low.

Although this one can seem intimidating, it's a lot more straightforward and easy to grasp than it seems. No heavy math involved (you rarely get more than 10 points in total to spend), usually the player turns aren't too complex either.

The artwork and the general theme are both awful and intriguing at the same time, reminiscent of the work of some underground artists from the 70's. Nothing makes much sence but the overal tone is still enjoyable in a weird way.

Unfortunately, as with most deckbuilding games, there's not much player interaction at all.

Initially learned the Dreamscape version, but got hooked anyway. We have been enjoying the base game (3rd ed.) plus Return of the Fallen regularly for a while now. I much prefer to teach this deck-building game to a new player rather than Dominion or Thunderstone. I appreciate that the turn structure is super minimal. And I also like that there is very little setup. Shuffle the big pile and go! I think that its minimal setup will help it outlast Thunderstone and even Dominion in my book.

Love the theme and art. The overall gameplay feels a little too much like a cold war arms race instead of the epic battle I was expecting. Im not a big fan of all the math required at the end of the game to decide who won... I prefer a more immediate and dramatic conclusion to a game.

I primarily play the game with my own solo variant where you start with a honor pool of 30 and your kills add to that pool and the opponents captures subtract from the pool. It creates a dramatic battle with a constant ebb and flow. 

Update: lost interest in this over time. I still like the theme but it's not connected with gameplay well enough to really feel cinematic.

Replaced by star realms. Ascension has a better sense of story and self but the faction mechanic is so much cleaner.

RATING: 5.5
I've played this quite a lot now, and it's pretty much fine but, for a game that's supposedly created by expert Magic players, it's not as clever as it thinks it is. 

The main problem is that it's all too easy to have no option but to load your deck with Heavy Infantry and Mystics because your hand is so limited and the random draw to fill the six slots on the tableau can leave you stuck if you've not drawn a balance of runes and strength into your 5-card hand. This can be a function of clever play by your opponents, but all too often it's just down to the card draw - you have a hand full of runes whilst the tableau is full of monsters requiring strength to defeat. A balance of runes and strength means you are limited to small increments unless you have cards in your and that allow stronger powers; therefore you need to buy weaker cards with powers in order to combo up to cards with stronger powers.

Now, this may not seem that different to Dominion et al, but in Dominion you have choice: buy any of the cards available that you can afford and adapt your strategy to suit. In Ascension, the optimal choice is almost always to buy/defeat the strongest card in the tableau, unless you have a particular combination you think you can use (such as taking a lifebound hero because you have a deck full of lifebound heroes and they tend to complement each other); however, the combos can be difficult to achieve if you don't dump weak cards - Militia and Novice for example.

Constructs are a neat idea, giving turn bonuses which can mitigate the hand randomness, and can be either powerful or frustrating in practice. Powers such as "You may put any Mechana construct into play immediately" (without first cycling through the discard pile) are useful only if there is a Mechana construct in the tableau (admittedly, there is a Construct that allows you to treat any Construct as a Mechana construct). 

Some other powers are much more useful, and there are some great cards in here, but the method of obtaining them affects the balance some. I just think there would be a better mix if there were more options on your turn or, if the options were to be limited, then less randomness.

Saying that, I've managed to win 32 of 35 games so far, so skill must play its part; but the random factor means that, whilst there are some nice ideas in here, it's ultimately a little unsatisfying.

Oh, and the artwork is just terrible.

[Edit:] Okay, so I've now played this over a hundred times and my question is: 'Why?'. This really is nothing more than an okay deck-builder with a huge injection of luck in the cards drawn into the central tableau. There are some really nice ideas, but they're hamstrung by the defeat/acquire/draw mechanism which means you can have a strong hand and achieve nothing - something a weak opponent can exploit by not churning cards in the centre, which is one of the game's better 'gamey' mechanisms. It's still true that you don't have to think much. Take or defeat the most powerful card you can afford. If you have anything left, take what you can. With some experience now, I think there may be just too many opportunities to dump stuff from your hand; plus it's one of those games that seems to finish just as you get a decent engine going.

Meh...

... yes, I know my play count would suggest otherwise. Not my idea.

Seriously improved once the Banish and Rally actions appeared.

Deckbuilding dumbed down to bare basics; nothing fancy, few synergies and fast free-for-all. Wait, no, I've meant this as a compliment. It's nowhere near to Thunderstone ([i]which we love btw[/i]) in terms of complexity or sophistication. That's exactly why it gets played way more often at us.

I've played thousands of times on iOS, entirely against the bot and without expansions, where my goal is to see how much I can win by. My biggest wins are:

214-64
213-39 (biggest point differential)
211-46
200-38

I now average about a 50 point margin of victory. No doubt my bot bashing strategy is suboptimal against humans, but I sure can beat that bot!

I've never played on the table, but it's clearly a fiddly game in that context, which is too bad, and one reason I don't rate it higher. Sometimes there are these huge turns near the end of the game where you play like 20 cards in a single turn.

Yawn... yet another take on the deck-building craze.  Nothing you haven't seen before, and other games do it better.  To Ascension's credit, it has a much faster set-up than the Dominions of the world, and it's arguably a quicker game experience.  Fantasy theme reeks heavily.

Light years better than Thunderstone. It suffers slightly from the same stall issue (don't take a card, for fear of revealing a better card for your opponent) but to a much smaller degree. Look, I'd still rather play Dominion, but Ascension is very well thought out. The constructs in particular are a nice way of mitigating the luck of the draw. My son enjoys it too.

The game is actually quite pleasant to play and I like the different strategies. I'm just rather worried about replay value, which to me seems to be low.

Update: Score upgraded to 8. This is actually quite fun and addictive. Playing this quite a bit as iOS version. Greatly enjoy Rise of Vigil in card form.
It seems that even the Chronicle of the Godslayer becomes quite varied once you add the first expansion.

My feeling is that getting any big box combined with the matching small box gives a got amount of cards and variety, without making shuffling a chore.

Light, quick and addictive. 

High degree of randomness but of course by controlling your deck size and composition, you can somehow mitigate that randomness.

Experienced MtG players (or possibly similar genre games) will know better the strategies (eg. Cards that draw is awesome).

Plays also somewhat like Dominion.

A game can be completed by 30 mins or less depending on number of players.

Highly versatile. Can be played with two players or solo (like Thunderstone).

For a long time I played Magic the Gathering. I have always loved drafting in MtG and this 100% scratches that itch without a major financial investment every time I want to play. 

That said, it's a pretty shallow card game. There are only so many strategies you can really accomplish and, at the end of the day, it's reliant on luck to save the day. Overall a solid game with nice art but overstays it's welcome.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Initially felt like an 8, quickly settled down into the mid-6 range for me (just like Thunderstone did.) Compared (inevitably) to Dominion: the gameplay is too chaotic, most of the cards feel too samey, I don't feel a lot of symmetry between the cards, and I don't like that you cycle through your deck less frequently.

This isn't to say Ascension is a bad game, it's not. It's just that with Dominion I feel like I'm captaining the ship, and with Ascension I feel like I'm along for the ride. I do not have the box.

After getting reacquainted via the iPad app, then acquiring Storm of Souls, I've reacquired the base game. It's light and the setup and teardown is easy. It's fun and I can enjoy it without having to think too hard, which is sometimes a nice change-up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I prefer the more strategic Dominion. In Ascension, too many turns are obvious with little to none decisions involved. The game's silly, yet at the same time fun, in a way.

I've only played the iPad version, though. That's a nice diversion, I don't think I'd be willing to use my rather limited board gaming time for "live" Ascension.

Indifferent.

Viele Leute lieben Dominion und feiern es, als den besten Deckbuilder unter der Sonne. Nun, für mich geht dieser Titel ohne Zweifel an Ascenion: Chroniken des Gottbezwingers. Man merkt, dass hier eine ganze Truppe kreativer Köpfe am Werk waren, denn bei Ascension stimmt einfach alles. Die Regeln sind schlank, strukturiert und zugänglich und die Fähgikeiten der einzelnen Karten selbsterklären. Durch die unterschiedlichen Fraktionen wie Mechana und Lebensbund, ergeben sich aber dutzende von unterschiedlichen Strategien. Die zufällig generierte Zentrale Auslage sorgt dafür, dass eine Runde Ascension nie gleich verläuft und ich mich immer wieder auf die neuen Gegebenheiten einstellen muss. Natürlich ist hier ein bisschen Glück im Spiel, aber das geht für mich völlig in Ordnung. Außerdem gibt es da noch fiese Monster, die die zentrale Auslage blockieren, aber auch Siegpunkte bringen, wenn man es schafft sie zu vernichten. Das Artwork von Ascension mag auf den ersten Blick befremdlich wirken, so ist es eben kein glatt poliertes Artwork, sondern künstlerisch wertvoll. Wer Deckbuilder mag, kommt um Ascension einfach nicht drum herum. Zum Schluss sei noch erwähnt, dass zusätzliche Erweiterungen dringend empfoheln sind, da sie weitere, spannende Mechaniken ins Spiel bringen.

My most played iOS game, including all the expansions. Interesting take on the deck-building genre with some (indirect) interaction and a randomly generated purchasing pool, in form of the 6 cards in the center. 1v1 is where it's at, as the randomness creeps in much more in 3 or 4 player free-for-all games.

RATING: 8
This is my pick of the deck building/cycling games that I played in 2011...and I've played around 10.

What sets it apart is that the central board always has 6 cards on offer which can be acquired or killed (monsters). As such the central board is always changing and the players need to adapt quickly and consider whagt cards they wish to add to their derck to develop a strategy to earn maximum Honour (VPs) or cycle quickly to those powerful cards.

Some consider the game too random and the decisions of which cards to get too obvious. I disagree about the obvious choice issue but do concede that the game can be a little random. Some strategies are hard to build from the base game alone but the 1st expansion fixes this issue.

The base game is best with 2-players.

The theme of this game will not appeal to everyone. It's a really cool game if you can find those who might enjoy a dark fantasy game. I can find people that would enjoy this; I just have to look harder. Consequently, the iPad version gets a lot more play from me than does the board game.

RATING: 7
The more I play it, the more I like it so I moved my score up a notch to an 8. Ascension is very accessible; it sets up and plays quickly, has virtually no down time, and scales well.  The gameplay is addictive and strategies are becoming more apparent as I play it more. That said, the game is more tactical since your are limited to what cards are available during your turn.  Another plus for the game is the artwork.  While a matter of personal taste, there is no doubt that it's unique to anything currently being produced.

This game is a competitive game, but not in a direct head-to-head way. Very rarely does what you do directly affect your opponent, outside of acquiring/banishing a card that they might have wanted.

Each game plays quite different, and rarely is the difference in score drastic. Many games we're not sure who exactly is winning until it comes time to count the points, and times when we think we know, we're wrong.

This deckbuilding game is very similar to Dominion and Thunderstone. Players draw a deck of 5 cards, and use them to purchase items (heroes, constructs) or combat monsters. The stuff for purchase/cpmbat are 6 revealed cards in the middle. When one card is dealt with, another card is immediately revealed from the deck, so you can keep cycling through. Of course this cycling through leads to a bit more luck on what shows up. 

It's a fast paced game. I enjoyed my playing of it, and it is not as complex as Dominion. There is enough meat for strategy on buiding your deck, but there still is the luck factor to deal with.

I like Dominion. But I got a bit cold with it.
Magic, is OK. I like the idea, just not actually playing it.

Yes, it's another deck-builder - more in the vein of DCDBG than Dominion.  The main difference with this one is that you actively remove the bad cards from play rather than taking them into your deck, and they give some sort of bonus for doing so.  The theme feels solid, and (from only a handful of plays) the expansions seem to blend nicely.

My first deckbuilding game!  I do prefer buying cards from a center row instead of buying from piles like in other deckbuilding games, as it makes hate drafting incidental rather than deliberate.  However, because of the limited player interaction, it may be best with fewer players.  Also, counting up honor points makes for a somewhat anticlimactic ending; I'd like to have seen some kind of final battle.

Pretty fun deckbuilder. I like the honor gems, they look great! There are four factions, each with a different focus on gameplay. Unfortunately, I don't think sticking with one faction is a great idea, since the better the card's effect, the more points the card is worth at the end of the game, so it's really just a game of getting a bunch of honor and getting the good cards.

But getting a good engine built with the Mechna construct is so satisfying that the game deserves a decent rating.

[b][COLOR=#FF0033]01/2018[/COLOR] -- 7 ---> 6:[/b] I played Dominion, and I just think that it was significantly better. I still think Ascension is enjoyable to play, but it didn't hold up very well to the only other competitive deck builder I've ever played, so I felt a little obligated to drop the rating.

A bit more intriguing of a game than Dominion is.  This is a deck building game where you are collecting two different types of resources every turn to claim cards in the center row.  I enjoy trying to make your deck work in this game because you have to wait and be a bit more tactical than in Dominion because all the cards are not available to you right at the start.

RATING: 6
A deck building game with a strong emphasis on tactics over strategy. I have a soft spot for the theme and some of the art, but without a strong narrative it’s a little bit superfluous. 

Caveat: I have only played this with 4 players and both expansions. I expect it to be more strategic with two or three players. I also wonder whether the large stacks make the game more prone to stagnating with a bigger chance of all monsters/buys in the centre row - which has crippled a couple of games.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I tend to not care too much for pure deckbuilders where cards you can buy are mostly showing up randomly and Ascension is pretty much the first one of those I played. There are now exceptions that I enjoy more, but there usually needs to be a bit "more" than just the deckbuilding or it needs to be really fast playing to have me interested in this style of deckbuilder.

Ascension is deck-building game that appears inspired by Dominion. Players start with an initial hand of cards which allows purchase of new cards. Some cards are more powerful "currency" for future purchases, other cards allow the player special actions. The goal is to have collected the greatest score in trophies at the end of the game. The main differences are:
(1) there are six face-up cards in the middle of the table, available for purchase. These are replaced from a common stock as soon as they are sold. So the set of cards is constantly changing, and there is less fiddly setup than at the start of Dominion.
(2) there are two types of "money"; coins (runes?) used to buy cards, and power points that are used to defeat monsters.
(3) no limit on actions or purchases each turn.
(4) points are scored for defeating monsters, and some cards are worth additional points at the end of the game. Players compete for a common pool of points ("Honour"), the game ends when the common pool is depleted.
I like Ascension: it is faster to set-up than Dominion, and easier to teach. It also comes in a smaller box. On the other hand, Dominion is a deeper game with much greater variability. 
(Ascension's expansions are really "options" - you probably do not want to use more than one at a time. Each adds its own flavour with little increase in complexity, but they add to setup/cleanup time).

RATING: 7.5
Pros: easy to learn and teach, fast set up, better than Star Realms, good game if you don't want to stretch your brain too much


Cons:  kind of dull, very light, random, if you add the expansions it gets a little tough to keep track of everything, not good with more than 2 players

the Legendary system is very similar, but with a better narrative than Ascension.  ie it tells a bit of a story.

A deck building game with no set up time, which is a huge plus.  Basically no rules makes it really easy to get going even with new players.  I was hoping for sort of a mix between dominion and race that would remind me of magic drafting, and that is sort of how it turned out.  The game is more lucky than dominion (not even in the conversation with race), but provides some interesting decisions.  As drafting does inherently have some luck as well, that is okay.  I was hoping to fall in love with it like race, which I have not, but I am more likely to pull this out than dominion for the set up speed.

Edit: The game introduced some new concepts for deck building games, but overall there just is not much depth to game play.  The game takes too long to play for what it is.

RATING: 8
A quick and clean deck building game. Like Thunderstone, you each start with a set deck and then have options to buy stuff or to kill stuff. The difference is that there are no decks to buy from. Instead there are only 6 cards displayed in the draft, a random mix of cards to buy and cards to kill, drawn from the the one central deck, so as your turn comes around, you get what you get and you don't get upset. Which makes for a more random deck build, but I actually enjoy (and may end up preferring) the unpredictability. Some turns you might get nothing, others there's some decent choices to be made. The stuff to kill are monsters and you get instant rewards (and opponents may be forced to discard stuff) and the stuff you buy could be heroes (which give any variety of purchase / kill power when you draw them back into your hand to play) and constructs (which once you draw and play stays out and generates good stuff each turn). Generally monsters and heroes get you VPs, constructs less so, so there's a choice there on which way to go. The game is easy to teach and it's quick to get up and going (an advantage over the others), but it's more random, sure. The overall variety from game to game may be lower (without the huge variety of card types that Dominion and Thunderstone provide) but it's perhaps made up for by having variety of deck thrust upon you intra-game.

When expansions and promos are added in, then Ascension becomes a 10.

This is a smartly designed card-drafting deck-builder. I like it better than Dominion. Like Dominion, the base game alone needs an expansion to be better. Games take less than an hour.

The artwork is distinct and unusual: it doesn't seem like much of today's recent unpolished digital fantasy stuff, but rather hand-drawn fantasy with a surreal dreamy quality which might turn off many people.

I prefer playing Thunderstone, Nightfall, and Star Realms, but I seem to not stop playing this.

"Very smooth 2-currency deckbuilder. Competitive, but has very few pvp attacks, and not much screwage. It is a high 7 for me, and is one of my favorite non-cooperative deckbuilders."

What I like:
- Two-currency deck-management game with unlimited buys
- Super simple and quick setup and teardown
- Plays quickly (45 minutes for 3p learning game)
- Very few pvp attacks

What I didn't like:
- Center row randomness is just a bit more than I like
- The card combos seem a bit less interesting than (for example) Legendary
- Graphic design is less functional than (for example) Legendary

This is a solid deck management game. Nothing amazing, but clean, simple, and quick. I would put the weight right around 2.0.

My rating is influenced by my customizations. The base game by itself, played by the book, would be an 8.
House rules - Customized player powers (think DC Deckbuilding). Separate monster deck (no cultist). Center row consists of 5 cards from the heroes/constructs deck, and 3 cards from the monster deck.

Pros:
Lots of room for customization, especially with expansion components.
Quick to setup and start playing, unlike Dominion or Legendary.
Each faction offers a different strategy for winning the game (as do my custom player powers).

Cons:
Can be a long wait between turns, especially with more than 4p.
Hard to plan your turn in advance, as the center row constantly changes.
My custom player powers could use more playtesting (Pro: an excuse to play more boardgames).

A really good cardgame at first try, but I start to think it's a bit broken. I'll get back to that when I have tested my theory some more. 

Havent decided on the brokenness, but I do realise that it's a lot about drawing the right cards, as the cards are very uneven.

After playing several times I see that there are more winning strategies than I first feared, but you really have to adjust your strategy to what kind of cards turn up.

And the more you play the more strategy you find in the game. After recently started to play two-player games on my iPhone I have developed my strategies a lot. I have also realized how important it is to buy the cards that allow you to draw more cards.

This is a deck-building game that features a card drafting instead of multiple piles of the same cards.  I really like the idea, but like many drafting games, the constant changing of the draft pool makes it completely impossible to plan things from turn to turn.  The card combination "branches" were a nice idea, and allowed you to build out your strategy differently than everything else.  This is a nice alternative to Dominion, if you're looking for something more chaotic and less strategic.

The more I play this game, the more I enjoy it. The base game is just ok by itself, but when mixed with the Return of the Fallen expansion and a few promos, the game feels complete. It's incredibly quick to set up, incredibly tactical and yet has enough strategy to keep the game deep enough to warrant repeat plays. The artwork is great, but incredibly dividing amongst gamers. Chronicle of the Godslayer has a few cards that are a bit "first draft", but the rest are very pretty. With the first expansion mixed in, this game opens itself to 4 players and doesn't feel quite as random.

Extras: Year One Promos and first expansion permanently mixed in. Sleeved in Opaque Green FFG sleeves. Insert tossed to fit sleeved cards.

plays quickly and is enjoyable enough. I think there are better games like this out there such as Dominion though. If you have people who struggle at Dominion but enjoy the idea of the game they might like this better. It's easier to play. 

I don't believe this game has the longevity that Dominion has but you will probably still get your money's worth of entertainment out of it.

I do believe that this game is a good fit for younger players getting into deck building or anyone for that matter getting into deck building.

edit: I have this on my phone now with all the expansions. No two games of this are alike but it's still pretty shallow it seems to me. I enjoy it enough to play on my device from time to time, but again I don't think it has the longevity as other similar titles have for me. I'll probably pick up any new expansion that comes out for it, but I doubt this game will ever make it to 100 plays.

I feel Star Realms is similar, but superior design to this one. ( how ever star realms can get dull if played to much as well)

This is a strong contender in the deck-building arena.  I think the rules are streamlined and accessible like Dominion, and the tableau offers interesting choices.  It's harder to develop your deck strategically (eg. hard to know if you will see much of a particular faction).  But it's easy to see how every game would be different and the choices would continue to be fun.  I like how there is always something to do (eg. beating up on the cultist) even with a weaker hand.

It is a solid Deck Building game, however, the drab colors did not get my attention. I liked the theme and play mechanics better in Thunderstone.

Note: I've only played the iPad version of this game,not the physical version.

IMO, this is the deck building game that sets the standard for deck building games.  I like the way you can play the total card value win (the mana game) or the monster destroying win (the attack game).  I haven't yet seen it implemented quite so cleanly in other deck building games.

My only complaint is that the theme is kind of arbitrary and doesn't matter to the gameplay.  Legendary does this much better, for example.

The good news is that it is easy to set up, the box holds everything perfectly, the VP gems are fun and a game doesn't take very long to play.  Unfortunately, there aren't as many decisions to be made when compared to other games I enjoy more.  There doesn't seem to be much interaction, either.  

There is some thought required as to whether it would be better to acquire cards that defeat monsters or cards that will gain hero cards at any given time.  However, you are somewhat at the mercy of the game, since the cards that come out might or might not coincide with what you are able to acquire/defeat.  Also, you could get a little unlucky if you need n to do something and you only have n-1.  

There may be too many constructs when playing with two, especially if they come out early.  

I've only played it a handful of times, so this evaluation might change.

Good but can be frustrating if you are stacking your deck with the opposite kind of "currency" from what is in the center row (ie all you have is mana when the center is monsters, all you have is attack when center is heroes/constructs).

Update: Now I understand that this is part of the game! You have to be prepared for anything!

Well, it's a deckbuilding game. An ok, maybe even fun diversion. Adds a twist to the genre in the cards you can gain come out randomly. I don't think that's a good twist. A large part of deckbuilding games is their varied setup, and coming up with a strategy that fits it. That's what makes cards vary in value; in one setup you might want card A, while in another setup B is superior. When cards come out randomly, there's no planning. And if card A is better than B, it will be so 90% of the time, the other 10% being the rare occasion when you've already acquired a card that goes really well with B.

There's already randomness and luck in deckbuilding games, in that you don't know in what order and combination your cards come out. You might really want that $8 card, but the cards in your hand only add up to $7. Bummer! When the cards for purchase come out randomly too, that's too much. Now you have that $7 and there isn't even a card that can be bought with $.

The experience is ok. Drawing cards, buying stuff, thrashing &c. is fine. Just know that you're at the mercy of the cards, and you have less influence over how you play than the person who shuffled the stack.

I liked this game a lot better with only two players.

--------------------

Every thing that makes Dominion good is lacking in this game.  The whole game is based off gaining cards that are randomly drawn into the pool so you can't build any sort of strategy into your deck like in dominion.  The game is simply but the best card(s) you can each turn and hope you get honor the turn the heros are out, and power the turn the monsters are.  Then on top of that theres a few cards that give 15+ point swings if you happen to be able to afford them.  And worse yet the rules are very unclear about a few of the core game mechanics such as when you replace empty slots.

Great game, lots of expansions to choose from, with a good number of ways to play. 
There are 4 main factions, each specializing in a different path to victory, but there's no need to be exclusive. 
Great size for travel, easy to teach, and accomodates up to 4 players.

Dominion style of game - but IMHO better than Dominion. Eliminates the cumbersome game preparation and always works with a full deck of cards which randomly become available. It would profit from better graphics, but the game itself is really good. Will happily await an expansion set with more cards!

At first it looks great, with a nice board and nice gems. But the artwork isn't as good as Dominion or Thunderstone, there's too much randomness in terms of what cards are available each term, and there's no enough variety of cards in the deck. A good deck-building game, but the strategy isn't as deep as I was hoping. I'd rather play Dominion, despite the longer setup time.

Thematisch ist dieses Spiel furchtbar schlecht, die Geschichte des Spiels kommt bei mir einfach nicht rüber. Warum trotzdem eine so gute Bewertung? Das Design der Karten gefällt mir richtig gut, auch wenn es bestimmt nicht jedermanns Sache sein wird. Es ist ein wirklich lockeres Deckbau-Spiel, das man locker vor sich her spielt und bei dem man trotz geringer Kombomöglichkeiten und wenig Entscheidungsfreiraum trotzdem das Gefühl hat, selber zu spielen. Dabei ist dieses Spiel keine Anstrengung (und Stimmung und Spannung kommt trotzdem auf). Und nicht zuletzt: die kostenlose App ist absolut grandios!

Not a very interesting deck building game for a few reasons. First you don't actually go through the entirety of your deck very many times (meaning that the composition and efficiency is less important). Second, your options for adding cards to your deck are limited and variable throughout the game. This is a significant problem because you can pretty much only add cards to your deck and almost never take them away. As a result, your hand largely plays itself. Not recommended.

The big draw for me is the low setup time.  I get all the fun of a deck-building game, without the pain of setup that the others have.

This game has its problems, mostly associated with some severe luck of the draw issues, that aren't really a problem in other games of this genre.  However, I'm usually willing to trade that for the quicker start.  I like Thunderstone a lot more, but if I just want a quick game, I'll probably pull this out instead.

A good deckbuilder, made by MtG experts. Then they kept making more expansions, and the cards started getting more expensive (in the in-game currency) and powerful. It's like they decided they had played enough MtG, so they made a new game, and then decided that they wanted to make it more like MtG. These people just don't understand that people don't play Magic for a reason.

A simple, fast and very light tactical deckbuilding game like Dominion or Thunderstone. It stays between both of them; it is not combo-oriented like Dominion, but more than Thunderstone and it has little more theme than Dominion but less than Thunderstone. However it's easier than them both, too much easy for my tastes and too random - very draw dependant. Furthermore last players in order of play seem to have some bad disadvantages.

Bits are good, but I find the box a bit too big, the board redundant and the plastic gems (despite their very pretty aspect) are not exactly what I imagine for 'honour'.

RATING: 8
This is the game that introduced me to the deck-building mechanic and also the game where that mechanic "clicked" for me.

The first set is great for someone new to Ascension and deck-building but veterans should look at the other sets or at least combine this set with Return of the Fallen.

The main problem with this one is that whoever manages to get the constructs is usually the winner, especially since the only ways to destroy an opponent's construct is by defeating one of the two monsters in the main deck.

Takes all of the crap out of the other deckbuilding games and focuses on getting play started as quickly as possible, with as little to track as possible.  Adds player interaction through a limited buy supply that can be manipulated in many ways to mess with the player following you.  Sets up in under a minute and has more varied gameplay with less total cards.  Purchased moments after a great demo at GenCon.

Most of my plays were iPadded, but there are some face-to-face plays in there as well. A completely tactical deckbuilder, in that there is zero point to planning ahead: you can't, not if you choose from among 6 cards each turn and build your deck piecemeal (as opposed to the Dominion-style complete market). Your turns are automatic: you perform whatever actions you can in the two forms of currency you can spend per turn (runes and strength), you buy the most expensive card you can, and things move along because the presence of the Cultist always gives you something to do; there are no "dead hands." 

Oddly addictive on the iPad but ultimately mindless. It also commits what I consider a major sin of modern gaming, which is to reward players for achieving strategic goals despite only giving them tactical tools to do so. In this case, being able to synergize your factions can create large action chains, but you can't plan to do that.

I like a lot of the parts of Ascension, but overall the game falls pretty flat to me. I dislike the center row purchasing mechanic surprisingly more than I thought I would. Mostly, the fact that someone can randomly rip exactly the card you need off the top and buy it out from under you is really frustrating. That, and if the center row is full of cards nobody wants/can buy, the game stagnates pretty hard.

I do enjoy playing every once in a while, but it definitely will start to grate on me after a couple of plays.

Frustrating game, I much prefer Thunderstone. Even if Thunderstone is random, Ascension is far far more so. Some games you're stuck taking bad cards only to give your opponent good cards. A turn like this in the beginning can allow one player to take a commanding lead and keep it for the rest of the game as his deck can now buy / kill anything while the opposing player can do very little since his deck can only take the left over bad cards. It's very frustrating to lose this way since there was no tactical decisions to make, luck simply favored one player.

The game really opened my eyes to board gaming and to deck builders.  Still a game I love to play even though I should be sick of it by now.  Playing this on iOS is a dream!  The art isn't for everyone but I personally enjoy it.  Expansions have added new features like event cards to make the game even more interesting.  I haven't even kept up with all of the expansions.  One of the very few games I can say I've played hundreds of times!  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I can sympathize with people who find this game a bit thin.  On the one hand, I do feel like statements saying the card purchasing is automatic and totally obvious to be a bit overstated; on the other hand, its not like there is a ton of depth to the system.  There are definitely a lot of rough edges to the game, too.  The victory point totals are just kind of off for some of the cards.  The randomness of the draw works against the synergistic powers of some of the cards.  I mean, come into play effects that depend on other cards to do anything at all are just stupid in a game as random as this one is.  

That said, I've enjoyed playing this for some reason. Despite the many flaws of the game, I actually don't mind playing it if someone else wanted to. What can I say? I guess I'm getting soft in my old age.  I would never buy a copy of this though, and would I recommend Dominion over it anytime.

Probably best as a two player game.  The card pool is a little more stable with 2 players. The more players you add, the more noticeable the game's flaws become.

[b]RO[/b]: [i]02/26/2016[/i]

Ascension is my favorite deckbuilding game. For my money, it beats Dominion and Thunderstone any day of the week. Yes, I know many other deckbuilders have come out since and I must confess I have played none of them but there is something about Ascension that pleases me on a fundamental level. In Dominion and [i]especially[/i] Thunderstone deck bloat is a serious and aggravating problem, what I mean by this is you will often find yourself with cards in your hand that are completely, and utterly useless or even that hurt you (And if deck thinning is your thing, the Void class of cards in Ascension will get your deck nice and svelte in no time).

You could utter the admonition "git gud newb" but lets be honest here... I can probably kick your ass, so you shouldn't do that. Kidding aside, the fact that basically every card is useful every time you draw it in Ascension makes me very happy. Even IF it simply allows you to draw another card or something that isn't extremely useful in and of itself, it does [i]something[/i] or helps you [i]somehow[/i].

Ascension isn't without it's flaws of course. It has been said that the game is very luck-y and can "play itself". But I don't buy that entirely, knowledge of the deck and crunching probabilities is a big part of the game (this of course only possible after multiple plays). Did a lot of monsters come out early? Well, there probably won't be many more coming out so better shift your acquisitions to purchasing power over military. Got a couple mechana constructs? Hmm, should you pick up those cards that let you banish and cycle to deck to get the crushing mechana combo going? Or switch gears? There [i]is[/i] strategy in this game, and long term planning even if it is mostly a tactical game.

A nice and quick three player game, but a really good two player game too.  I probably prefer Thunderstone for a three-player game with others that like a Fantasy or RPG theme, but I play Ascension a lot with my wife and we really like the streamlined play it offers.  The mentions of it as Thunderstone-light are probably not far off-base, though it does stand on its own.

RATING: 7
I enjoy this game quite a bit. I think it's a great beginner deckbuilder because it isn't very complicated, but there is a decent amount of depth with this game. The expansions that I've played add a lot of complexity to this game. It's a good game that seems to be overshadowed by other deckbuilders, but it's still worth playing.

I haven't played many deckbuilders, so this may apply to others, but my issue with this game is you might go for a military heavy deck, and then rarely see any monsters. Or all of the cards on the center become expensive and it gets difficult to purchase them for anyone, so they kinda remain until you get a good hand.

With that said, it's a great deckbuilder.

Currently this is my favorite deck-building game, BUT I vastly prefer the app version of it. The constantly changing center row (purchasing field) makes this game more tactical than the fixed offer in Dominion, but contrary to the general opinion I don't find this random just tactical. I usually strongly prefer strategy vs. tactics but in this time frame and in this context I like Ascension much more than Dominion.
Additionaly I somehow despise the absoluthly themeless nature in Dominion {off-topic: Once I read an article from a MtG designer about how the development of a cycle goes, and he described how the basics of Magic is just pure math, and that testing is all about cards with just numbers on them, whithout any illustration or actual theme: this is Dominion for me}, but here I find the theme very intriguing. Even if the art sucks! 
And the countless expansions make this game endlessly replayable.

(25) It's great that this game is faster to setup then Dominion, but I feel like that's really all it has going for it when making the comparison.

I find the randomness of the center row to often be very frustrating in this game, so if I look at it as a serious game then it falls short.  However, if I look at it as a fun filler (or maybe a slight step over a filler) then it fills that role nicely and I enjoy it.

While playing Ascension I'm reminded of a lot of other cards games. It's easy to see that this comes from the minds of Magic the Gathering players, but what this really resembles is Thunderstone. One thing Ascension holds over these other card games is that it plays much smoother. Even with expansions and up to six players, the game doesn't really get bogged down,except maybe towards the very end when people start to have really complicated decks. Keep in mind, the more players you have the more luck gets involved, seeing as the available cards will almost completely refresh before your turn comes around again. Either way, this is probably my current favorite deck-builder.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Not ready to rate this after one play. Word on the street is that it has depth and subtlety once you are familiar with the cards. But I felt (as others have complained) that I was at the mercy of the shuffles, much more so than with either Dominion or Thunderstone. I will be playing it again, and hope to understand it better.

Production values: I didn't like the cards, which felt like stamped cardboard and not like real cards. I'm afraid they'll chip and fray at the edges too easily, and may not withstand bending as well as real cards would.

Rating for the iOS digital adaptation, which is superb (lots and LOTS of live and async online plays)

Joint rating for the base set [Chronicle of the Godslayer] and Return of the Fallen [RotF], as this is my preferred way to play Ascension.

Ascension is a dark fantasy deck-builder, that has been ridiculed for its laughably shoddy art-work style. Once you get past the art-work, Ascension is a fast-paced, excellent deck-builder that has different routes to victory (moreso when playing with RotF with the base set), with a number of different considerations: which card(s) to purchase, board-state, on-board and off-board honour points, what strategy is your opponent following, the rate at which honour points are decreasing, and card assessment in the beginning, mid, and late game.

Detractors claim that Ascension is a luck-fest where winning is a simple matter of purchasing the highest cost card from the 6 center cards available. This is completely and wholly false, and ignores all of the above considerations, greatly underplaying the importance of understanding board-state and card assessment. 

The digital adaptation by Playdek, and online play is so good - and introduced me to async gaming - that I will never play the physical version.

deck building game that plays similar to Dominion although you play your cards in any order.  Game doesn't really feel like you doing anything with the theme so you really don't get the feeling you building anything important. The randomness of the card flip makes is hard to pick a strategy since you have no idea what is coming up next.   The game itself is decent and I'd play it from time to time if asked but it not the best choice for deck building.

This has become my go-to iPad game. Certainly more than 100 plays by now. I usually play vs two AIs or just against Cass. I usually beat the AIs but usually lose against Cass.

RATING: 8
This is the first BIG solely deck building game that I've played. Well, I like deck building and this was fun. It does all the things that a deck builder should. However, I don't think it really felt different, innovative, or new. It felt almost completely the same with just different art and symbols that seem to do all the same things. I'd happily play this as a fast playing deck builder game. However, I don't see anything that would even replace it from the super small Star Realms or Hero Realms. I guess the only thing is that it works with more than 2 players. I'm worried all games like this are going to just feel like a re-themed version of the exact same thing.

This game took one of the elements I liked least from Thunderstone (random cards available during your turn) and made a whole game around it. Some positive things this game has going for it: it's easy to set up and is a fairly light and relaxing game. It's not really an interesting or engaging one, though. 

This game is quite random as you are simply buying/ defeating the current best card(s) that is available. You could say it's tactical, but the best choice is often pretty obvious. This is a "deck building" game less about building a deck than cobbling one together based on limited, random options each turn.

The Deck Building Game witnessed a boom in 2010: we saw too many DBG in too short time, Resident Evil, Thunderstone, Ascension etc. Ascension is a quick DBG, eliminating all of the set-up problems that generally revail in DBG. It has short learning curve and exciting combos. But the replayability is severely lacking. It's a game of 10 plays at most, in my opinion.

I expected god-slaying.  There was no god-slaying in my copy.

This game would absolutely jump with a first-to-the-top endgame condition.  Get as tough as you can as quickly as you can, then claim the throne.  The player on the throne gets a defense bonus for anyone attacking him.  Each player goes for the throne when they choose; last man on the throne wins.  That should-I-stay-or-should-I-go aspect would add some heat to what is otherwise an accounting session.  

Honestly, this is half a game.  Given its theme and overall concept it needs something to pull the players together.

In my opinion, the best of the deckbuilding games. Supplanted Dominion for me, and Thunderstone didn't have a chance, although I like both.

This game beats both of those due to its quick set up time and its more poker-like skill requirements. Making the best of what's available rather than determining your "domingine" from the first turn usually creates more interesting choices, although there are still times when the game is on autopilot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
My introduction to the deckbuilding genre.  I like the quick and easy setup of Ascension, with the center row of cards.  

The monsters in the center row make for an interesting balance of purchasing and combat, though everything is worth points in the end.  I find the concept of making your deck as efficient as possible intriguing, though I'm still learning the nuances of it.  

Ascension has a few problems, though, which makes me think it will fade in favor of other deckbuilders (like Star Realms).  I like the idea of the factions but I don't feel they had enough of an identity, mechanically or thematically, to really stand out.  I also think the factions are imbalanced, as the player who gathers the most Mechana's is most likely to win because of their huge point values (and gaining Mechana's makes it easier to gather other Mechana's).  

Finally, I'll beat the dead horse:  this game's artwork is atrocious, some of the worst I've ever seen in a mainstream release.  I really feel this hurts the game, as I'm not drawn in by the art, it doesn't add much theme, and it's so ugly I feel no desire to acquire cards beyond their mechanical value.  Really missed opportunity there.  

Disclaimer:  I've only played the base game, no expansions.  I have heard the artwork and factions are both improved in some of them, but I can't attest to it personally.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Lightly enjoyable but kind of same-y: the cards feel like they are all doing the same sort of thing, the two games we played felt like they were the same game. I think making every card a VP card was kind of a mistake.

Since I already own & enjoy Dominion I feel no need to own this game as well. If a friend had it I'd play it with them. Kind of sad that this game is so obviously in response to Dominion but, to me, is essentially pre-obsoleted by it.

This is a compromise if you like Thunderstone but hate the setup. It plays fast ... almost too fast some games. It feels like once your really ready to go, you only get maybe 1 or 2 turns through your deck unless everyone is attempting to employ the same strategy and its going slowly. I think this is a great fill in the time gap deck building game.

I'm not a big fan of the ascension-style deckbuilders with a changing middle row.  These seem to have a lot less room for strategy and rely more on something existing that meshes with your hand on any given turn.  If you start out slow, you are likely going to get behind as other folks's engine start to roll.  Not a terrible game, but not terribly exciting either.

Ugh. I really wonder what it is I am missing here. This just isn't a game! These early games that 'solved' the problem of theme-lack in Dominion are a travesty. Maybe it gets better with expansions?

2015 Edit: I do quite enjoy the phone version from time-to-time, however. My earlier "isn't a game" verdict should be "isn't a game that has much appeal for me". And the Dominion 'solvers' aren't a travesty - but I still don't think any beat the original for genuine, solid game play. I wouldn't play Ascension on the phone if I had an equally well-implemented Dominion app. Star Realms gets what this does right, I reckon. BTW, played this online a bit and got fairly regularly beat, so I guess that there must be something more than luck of the draw/buy the best card involved! Rating upped to a 5

I'm sure there are some subtleties to this game, but they have escaped me thus far (maybe half-a-dozen games.)  It commits the opposite sin to Dominion in that the planning is largely negated in favour of opportunism and the double randomness of the cards (board and hand) lead to frustration.  Then again, the game is over pretty fast so it doesn't matter as much.
And at least there actually is thematic chrome which helps.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Plays track games against human opponents and do not count playing against the app AI.

Ascension is a fun deckbuilding game for 2 players with more strategy than many give it credit for. Additional players leads to too little control and planning due to turnover of the center row, and too much downtime. The game is more tactical than strategic, but there is an enormous amount of replayability. I've played the app against the AI thousands of times, which is pretty much the best way to play the game. Ascension also works as a 4 player partner game using a variant for 2 center rows, though it's a bit slow that way.

In the first block, mechana constructs are too strong, and many of the low cost cards aren't really worth taking.

In the second block, there is a focus on trophy monsters, and they added soul gems, which are an extremely random bonus. Mechana constructs are a little too weak, lifebound is a little too strong, and the card abilities are a little more diverse. Soul gems add an extra element of randomness that I'm not the biggest fan of, but it's functional. The low cost cards tend to be better, than in the first block.

In the third block, energy is a 3rd resource which is needed to trigger certain abilities. The way treasure works gives you an incentive to sometimes take cards you normally wouldn't, but if you never have energy when you need it, it can be frustrating. Many of the cards permanently transform if you have enough energy, making the low cost cards much more interesting. The factions seem relatively balanced.

In the fourth block, there are multi faction cards, a much bigger emphasis on playing faction cards, and Mystics and Heavy Infantry are even worse than in the other blocks as a a result. Low cost cards are much more interesting and valuable, and there is greater potential for chaining things together. Enlightened is the strongest faction, but the balance between the factions is better than in the first 2 blocks. You start with an affiliation with one of the factions, and the card you get as a bonus for the enlightened one is much weaker than the cards for the other affiliations, but getting to rally enlightened is better than rally any of the other factions, so I suspect those balance out.

Overall the later blocks are more random than the earlier blocks, and I suspect that the first 2 blocks are the best if you want a strategy game, though you're better off with Puzzle Strike or something if you want strategy.

Sencillo deckbuilding, perfecto para echar partidas de 20-30 minutos. Muy rápido de preparar y de aprender y fácil de jugar. Un juego sin muchas aspiraciones, con una buena dosis de azar y pocas decisiones que tomar.

En comparación directa con Thunderstone, me quedo con Ascension por la rapidez de setup y de la partida. Además, tiene una serie de conceptos para mí más desarrollados, como los constructos y que los monstruos no se quedan en tu mazo.

En su contra, puede quemarse rápidamente porque no se trata de un juego demasiado profundo y produce el efecto pique (es difícil echarse una sola partida).

El juego no está en castellano, pero el inglés que utiliza es muy simple. El arte del juego es controvertido, a mí sí que me gusta, pero menos que las excepcionales ilustraciones de Thunderstone.

A very fun game that's relatively easy to teach and new players can often win on their first time playing. 
Strategy is relatively simple, and luck is a very present factor, but players will feel good when they sense they made great combos on their card purchases, and will alternatively quickly learn how bad choices don't work out so well. 
Definitely arguable that this game (or at least the base cards) lend very heavily to optimum strategies and so remove a little agency from players given there are rather definite better choices.

Fast-playing deck builder with a MtG meets Dominion (there's mana and combat) gameplay.

Players use their rune cards (mana) to buy cards to enhance their abilities to building power to beat up monsters(for VPs). Stuff purchased (economic-engine route) also grants VPs.

Rinse and repeat and you have Ascension.

Looks overly simplicistic and boring at the first look, but it is in fact a very sensible attempt at a quick and dirty deck building game. After a few plays, some ideas for strategies do emerge and synergies between the cards become visible. Astoundingly good.

Also: The German translation is terrible.

RATING: 7
Card, Dominion-like. Good game. You can clearly see the influence of Dominion, but the game has a more tactical play style. I'm not sure yet if there is more opportunity for strategic play -- I like that you can't decide exactly what strategy you will pursue before play actually starts, compared to analyzing the tableau beforehand in Dominion. Faster setup, smaller footprint, and theme are plusses as well.

Looking forward to more plays. Rating is after 2 4p games -- I look forward to a 2p game as I think the direct interaction over the center row will be more significant and richer.

Update: got a few plays with 2p and 3p in now. Good game. Definitely feels a little different with different number of players; a little more chaos with more, but still good/fun. I like that in 2p you can directly affect your opponent's choices, rather than just 1 of your opponents. Look forward to seeing where they go with future cards. Must resist the urge to design my own cards.

It's okay. Not too much to think about - some cards are good and I always buy them, some are crap and I don't buy them, some are fine at certain times in the game so I only buy them then.

I've tried different strategies with little success, since you can't plan ahead due to random board cards.

Still, it's a useful filler for when I can't sleep.

I wanted to like it, but I found few decisions to be had. The big problem is that there is no limit to the number of buys that you have.  That means that you just buy what is available to you, and the player that has the best cards available to them when they have the right hand will be better for it.  Most of the buys were obvious, so you just bought the best things that you could get.  Ultimately, this means that the player that had the opportunity to buy the best cards early on will be rewarded by being able to have more flexibility to buy more cards later in the game.  There isn't much that you can do to further your game when the cards that come out don't match your hand currency.  So the majority of the game revolves around how lucky you are to have good cards available to you that you can buy.  The whole thing feels like it plays you more than you playing it. Disappointing.

I don't find this game very interesting, but my wife loves it. It wouldn't be in my collection anymore if it weren't for that fact. 

The game is too tactical for my tastes. There is not much you can look into strategically, other than the small display of cards. There are two major strategic arcs to explore (constructs vs. monster killing) with maybe a couple of sub-arcs (which faction to concentrate on, how much to invest into each major arc, etc) depending upon what shows up. That is my main beef: the game is entirely dependent upon what shows up. Other than the two main arcs, I don't see much room for strategic exploration. Sure, you may figure out which card combos work best, but that's about it. 

Maybe some expansions would correct this, but I don't want to put more money into a gaming system I don't generally love in the first place. There are many other deck builders that I get more enjoyment out of (Dominion, Trains, Valley of the Kings, Study in Emerald). This is not my go-to game for the genre.

I've always liked Dominion -- Ascension to me is perhaps not the better game, but  I find it to be more fun to play.  The art and theme are fabulous and the mechanics of the factions and the center row are very enjoyable to me.  Steadily on the rise as one of my favorites.  *Update* After 10 plays, I still enjoy Ascension, but I did have to lower my rating to an 8.  It doesn't have a lot of depth to it, so maybe there's an expansion that can help that.  *Update* From what I've seen from the expansion, I'm not pleased.

Not a fan of deckbuilders, hence the lowish rating. Still, nothing really spectacular here.

Components - 1/1 Deck building game, the cards are cards, and the board/gems provided are fine. The wife absolutely loves the gems (reminds her of bejeweled which she loves)

Fun - .7/1 A little harsh, as this is my wife's favorite and thus we've played back to back to back to... I'm a little burned on it but overall I've loved this better than Dominion (the only other deck builder I've played at the time of this writing). It ultimately has more interaction than Dominion as well.

Replayability - .7/1 Deck is big enough to allow for many replays

Strategic - .7/1 A lot of luck, what cards are turned up on your turn, what you get in your deck, but these are common for the genre. Smart deck building will mitigate some of the luck, in addition there is plays that you will do to block other players, or combos to give you loads of victory points. It's a balance between short term and long term goals.

Theme - .3/1 Honestly, I just don't feel much of it when playing. I feel like the power/runes/monsters/heroes are sort of plug and play. I think it's more me (particular for deckbuilding, Domainion is even worse to me in this regard) than anything else.


Personal Review - 4/5 Prior to the wife and I playing this to death, I really did enjoy this game a lot, now it's still fun, just a little worn. There is a ton of expansions and they seem to help keep even more options in the game, though I'm trying to keep this review to just the core game.

RATING: 6
It's a deck-building game like Dominion, but with several differences:
- no fixed tableau of (10 out of ... fiftinfinity) cards to purchase; instead, all cards are shuffled into a deck and become available randomly (about 8? available at any time)
- 3 things (2 cards, and a way to purchase VP tokens) are _always_ available
- 2 different currencies (silver and red)
- some cards stay out permanently and have ongoing effects

But also a few similarities:
- VP tokens (as added in ... Seaside?)
- Equally unthematic. Godslayer? Really? No, these were just cards in different colors and different costs.

Overall, I prefer Dominion, esp. Prosperity. You're building a deck here, but you can't really build a strategy: cards come up randomly so you have to play entirely tactically. Really, it felt like I simply bought whatever I could afford at the moment. I'm sure (I hope, anyway) that with repeated play and better knowledge of the cards in the game, there would be some basis for choosing which particular cards to buy (on those rare occasions when you can afford more than one of the cards on display). But I don't expect to seek this out again, although I would be willing to try it again if someone else wanted to try the game.

The deck building mechanic is one of my favorites.  I love Dominion and all its spinoffs and enjoy Thunderstone too.  I rank Ascension between the two, although closer to the higher ranked Dominion.  The game system is elegant, a trait I'm appreciating even more than ever in games.  It's not as varied or deep as Dominion and obviously its design owes a debt to Dominion to a certain extent, but those are minor issues.  I'm not even a fan of fantasy, fighting themes, yet I still like this one quite a bit.

I was a huge Magic: The Gathering fan for a long time before I couldn't keep up with the cost required to stay competitive.  I like this game with a very similar feel that has everyone starting from the same level and the same availability of cards.  Sure, there's a lot of random elements and once someone gets in a good position it is hard to unseat them but it is a lot of fun and it scratches that M:TG itch.

I guess this may not be kosher to add to my collection since I only own the iOS version.  Ah well.

I've played maybe a dozen games of ASCENSION over the past week, and while I like the idea of the center row and monsters to fight, I find I could take or leave the game for the most part.  Still seem to like this more than DOMINION, though.

7/20/11 -- definitely starting to get hooked on this game. 

7/22/11 -- actually starting to change my mind about this game; seems to be limited after a good number of plays 

2/22/12 -- Really got into Dominion, so thought I'd buy a copy and get my work friends to play.  Sad thing is that this game is a major hassle to play in real life, and I find myself just wishing I was playing Dominion.

Demo copy.

Rules look like it could be good. But why oh why put 200 cards and a few tokens in a box that size? 

The board is redundant (which takes up the space). Would have been much better to have put this in a small box with no board and shaved £7 - £10 off the cost.

Card stock poor as well

My one play was a pretty poor experience. Came down to the luck of the draw.

Comparisons of this to Dominion and Thunderstone are many and this traces its lineage back to Dominion and like Thunderstone this implementation involves killing monsters.  This plays much better than Thunderstone IMHO.  Having permanents in play as an option adds an interesting victory path...it also adds to the confusion.  Lots of variable power and "if/then" abilities make managing a turn difficult and sometimes time consuming, something that Dominion has no trouble with.  Better than Thunderstone but still a 7.

Quick deckbuilding game playable solo, with fast setup and takedown. Often compared to Thunderstone, yet I find the two very different, Ascension being a lot more random. The cards you buy in Thunderstone are a fixed pool determined at the beginning of the game, whereas in Ascension, there is only one pool of cards that includes both monsters and allies. It is a different mechanic that makes for quicker yet more random games, but I enjoy both. When there is little time for a game, Ascension is the better choice and still very entertaining with some nice combos.

It is a fun way to pass the time but it doesn't feel like there is any real long term planning. The tactical choices are just ok. It feels like there are optimal tactical moves every round, and it feels more luck based if you manage to get cards that work together really well.

This is a cool take on the new "deck building" craze.  "Dominion" was fun while it lasted, but it lost its lustre as time went on, and the effort to set up the game prevented it from being played as often as it could have been.  Fortunately, with "Ascension", setup is a breeze and players can dive right into the game.  I also enjoy the fact that it is a slightly more tactical game than "Dominion" (even if it is less strategic) since there is a smaller and ever-changing assortment of cards to choose from.  There are also some fun new elements, such as the Rune/Power points, the Construct cards, and the victory points on the cards.  One downfall of the game is that there seems to be even less player interaction than in "Dominion".  And the artwork is even more hideously ugly than that of "Dominion", if you can imagine that.  Not to mention the very strange "theme", which involves the most bizarre mix of mechanical and fantasy beings...  But to end on a positive note, I do enjoy those acrylic gems!  Sparkly!  Overall, a fast and fun game.  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 6.5/10

RATING: 7
Dismissed this one early on as yet another Dominion clone with dodgy art, but the art has grown on me -- and, returning to it, I find it fixes everything I hate most about other deckbuilders.

By way of context, I like Dominion a lot as a design. I have logged several hundred plays of the Android implementation and [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/538/review-battle-of-gundabad]iOS clone[/url] -- but I find it unbearable as a physical card game. Partly because it's dry as the Sahara, mostly because it takes as long to set up and put away as it does to play, which only makes sense if you play more than one game in a row. In that case, I'd rather play one game of something longer.

Ascension fixes the "setup problem" by replacing the multiple draw piles with a central tableau. There are three always-available cards but otherwise players share an ever-changing array of 6, drawn from a single stack. This increases the variety of cards available through the game, though it obviously also increases the randomness -- you may well feel victim to the whims of the deck.

But to reiterate, setup time is about 30 seconds.

Many of the usual deckbuilding issues apply, e.g. that downtime increases with the number of players and it largely feels like a "multiplayer solitaire" experience. Unlike other deckbuilders, the draw randomness can make it frustratingly difficult to exploit card synergies; you can't build an engine if the game is determined not to let you.

That all suits me because the niche it fills in my collection is that of two-player "super filler". (It does take more but two is the sweet spot for both strategy and speed.) It's strategic enough to maintain interest, and it's quick to set up, quick to explain and quick to put away.

I traded it because I don't have much call for two player fillers and 99% of my matches were on iOS.

Nice deckbuilding game, pretty basic so it's good for introducing the deckbuilding mechanic to beginners. Also I like the weird fantasy theme. I have the "Deckbuilding Game" edition which improves the artwork significantly.

I like the random card row much better than the fixed decks in Dominion, so there's a tactical element and you have to deal with what's available instead of trying to optimize a certain card collection.

I was instantly fascinated by the art. The is one of the most unique and interesting artwork that I've seen in a game.

The reviews and lack of strategy mad me a bit afraid so I did not buy it.

Then I beta-tested the IOS version and really liked it. It was fast and fun although not deep enough and got repetitive after some plays. That's why the rating for the game.

The expansions seem to help here and I'm pretty sure the rating for them will be higher. I intend to buy the first expansion but the main game only after the new cardstock-reprint is out.

First impression after two games:
Quite different from Dominion as you don't seem to pick a strategy at the beginning. Feels quite tactical and more luck-dependent.
The art is horrible.

Update (27.04.2012): Bought the IOS app to play solitaire. Yet I am still not seeing the point after two dozen games.

Update (29.05.2012); Learned that there are some really mean combo opportunities if you thin your deck and acquire the relevant parts.

Update (11.11.2013): The art is still horrible.

RATING: 8
Initial rating 8. Could go up. 

I am a disciple of the Church of Dominion, but this is really, really, really good. Granted, it is much lighter than the big 'D' and there is not much room for strategic play. But I am all about tactical and even more about fun, and this presses both of those buttons. If you think of Dominion as 'steak and baked potatoes' then maybe Ascension is 'burger and fries.' Both yummy. But one is more substantial and the other is great for quick, easy, on-the-go sustenance that might make you a little gassy, but what the hell.

Recommended, unless you really want/need to be able to formulate a strategy. I just don't think that's here. Read some of the 3-4 rating reviews and maybe play before you buy. I can't argue with the low ratings because alot of what they say is spot on. But they're looking for different things in the game than I am, and that's okay.

The artwork, however, is strictly amateur hour. Remember having that friend in high school who could kinda draw and his colored-pencil monsters would be sorta cool but you knew deep down that it wasn't that great? This is that.

To win: buy cards that give you power, particularly Heavy Infantry.  It only takes a few rounds before you can beat up anything in the game, and if there are no monsters you can still punch cultists for decent points.  For the moment I enjoy it, but if I keep playing it my rating will likely go down.

Fast moving Thunderstone/RftG hybrid (more in common with Thunderstone). There are limited, constantly changing choices. I like the ability to do several things on a turn, and the way every card you can get will score points, which really gives you incentive to keep building a deck instead of trying to keep it as small as possible.
Minimal set up and take down time is a BIG plus!
On the downside, the art is quite ugly.

Ascension is like many other deckbuilder; a simplified Thunderstone and a very obvious predecessor to Star Realms. Despite the silliness of the whole thing I find myself more interested in this than I have been in any previous deckbuilders primarily due to the art in the game. I'm not sure if I like the art or think it's well done (later sets look better) but it is interesting enough that I enjoy checking out each card. 
Only time will tell if I keep playing it.

RATING: 4.8
Just another deck building game. Lacks the theme or excitement of Nightfall and the central stack of cards is not really any different to Thunderstone's cave. Essentially; either pick all runes or all power and go all in, or hedge your bets and split between the both (probably the best strategy for winning percentages). 

Frankly, pretty dull and still too solitaire.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
This game is pretty fun, it's not quite as deep as the typical deck building games in that it limits your choices on your turn, in essence the game almost plays itself based on what is available to you on your turn.

It takes the one decision from Dominion that you had (what to buy) and takes even that away from you.  So it is very scripted feeling. 

That being said, it's quick to set up and play, and it does have some differences in the order in which things can get played changing things up.  So it keeps me entertained enough to play it.

Update: The more I play this game, the more bored I get of it.  It basically plays itself completely.  Just pick from what's available at the time of your play and see who won at the end.  Not a whole lot going on here.

Very small print, hard to read upside down. The mat enforces a particular arrangement that is inconvenient for half the players. The ability to string actions, buys, and combat in any order for as long as you have stuff means it can take some time to figure out the best order, slowing the game. The board can clog with too-expensive stuff, reducing the game to killing cultists.

My rating is based on the physical game. 

I have the game and all the expansions on iOS and its really quite fun - but the game keeps track of everything and moves the cards and whatnot 15x faster than you can play the game in RL. Even with only two players, this would be tedious in RL. That I can play a game on my iPad in like 5 makes it fun.

Originally, I liked the non-Dominion method of the layout for cards.  Though after about 20 plays, I feel that Dominion is a much better game, based on the card interactions, and variety of game play.

Even with the first expansion, the gameplay has not improved.

And the artwork is horrendous!  Some of the worst I have ever seen in any professionally published game.  Definitely reduces the overall appeal of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not a bad deck-building game. The constantly shifting tableau of cards to purchase/fight keeps things interesting. However, it also makes it tough to plan too far ahead. Like all deck-builders, the more you play, the more you learn about effective card combinations that can win you the game. Ascension will never be a favorite of mine, but I enjoy it for what it is every once in a while.

This is sort of a Dominion clone with a fantasy setting.  The unique thing about this one is that there are two kinds of "money," one that lets you battle monsters, and one that lets you buy things.  The constructs (permanents) always seem like they just get destroyed so you can't count on them, but I suppose if they get activated even once, then that's still a good deal.

"Ascension" es un juego de cartas de Construcción de Mazos donde los jugadores gastan Runas para adquirir cartas de mayor poder de un stock central de 6 cartas descubiertas disponibles. Cuando una de estas cartas es comprada o eliminada es remplazada por otra del mazo, en el que también hay cartas de monstruos que hay que derrotar. Es de la familia "Dominion" o "Thunderstone", pero con una mecánica distinta. Es menos estratégico que Dominion, es más rápido y también es divertido. El nuevo "DC Comics DBG" es muy parecido (están de moda los Deck Building Games). Hay muchas cartas promo que se pueden adquirir en la web oficial del juego.

This is the game I wanted Thunderstone to be.  It's essentially Dominion with two forms of currency: runes to buy things that improve your deck and fighting strength to kill monsters for both points and immediate one-shot beneficial effects.  The rules are actually simpler than Dominion and the card effects quite well balanced (in contrast to Thunderstone).  And despite lacking an analog to attack cards, the game is far more interactive.  One of the better games I've played in a while.

The game is touted as designed by serious Magic: The Gathering players, but Ascension is much more derivative of Dominion and Thunderstone than Magic. In fact, it's probably too derivative.

Small, thematic deck-building with a fantasy theme; everyone drafts cards into their deck from a small, constantly changing selection and tries to get the most points (either through collecting valuable cards or defeating monsters).

This rating assumes you're playing a variant in which a second row of cards is placed above the center row. These cards aren't available initially, but fall into the center row when the card below them is purchased. This makes it easier to plan between turns, and speeds up the game. With rules as written, it's a 6, probably.

*Update, have now played a ton of two-player without the variant on iPad, and at least in that two-player form, it still ranks as a low 8 or high 7.

This was my introduction to deck builders and still has a place in my collection and in my playing. I especially love it as a for-travel game, you just throw a bag with the crystals and a double-deckbox with the sleeved cards from the base game into your luggage and you are fine. Setup is super fast and play time is compact, so you can just run a game on the evening while sitting out on the terrace of your vacation home. I especially like that it is quite relaxing to play, due to the missing take-that elements. Gets less plays due to Paperback having taken over as travel deck builder of choice.

I think this is a well designed game with great visual appeal but I'm getting burnt out on card drafting games. Unfortunately the mechanism favors a thorough understanding of the entire collection of cards and advance planning on potential combinations. This, to me, is akin to reading trivia cards before playing in order to have an edge in the game. I enjoy the discovery process while playing and that is a significant disadvantage in this type of game.

RATING: 3.5
First Impression:

A simple deck building game that emphasises in strange theme and art.

So what's good about this game; Well the art might appeal to some (I detest it), and it plays fairly quickly. There some interesting combos but in order to pull them off you'll need a lot of luck.

Make that tons of luck actually. Offering different options in each players turn is not working here. They managed to take a skill-based mechanic and completely ruin it with merciseless luck of the draw. The end result is dissapointing. Players will do better or worse clearly depending on the whim of the deck, and thus the whole strategy part of the deck building falls apart and leaves only the shuffling and counting. If deck building was implemented like this when it first appeared, it wouldn't have even earned it's place among the other mechanics. I could continue describing other elements of this game that I don't like, like the art or the theme but these are all minor for a game that just doesn't play well.

I really dislike this game, pretty much all aspects of it.

Update: Having played Star Realms, I now know this particular variant of deck building Ascension created works. Just not for Ascension though!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Adds some twists to the Dominion deck building model, but ultimately this is less my style than its ancestor. While Dominion is a puzzle where you decide on a strategy when you see the pool of available cards and then play the game out to see the effects of that strategy, Ascension is an almost entirely tactical exercise of buying the best available card(s) from those that are randomly available on your turn. After a few plays these tactical decisions become automatic once you have grasped the relative strengths of the various cards. The game description promises something new, exciting and better than Dominion, but the description ends up as the most interesting part of the game, which is the very definition of ho hum. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Super quick to setup. Ascension is a great, lighter deck building game to pull out if you don't feel like taking a while to setup ala Dominion or Thunderstone and if you don't want to think about ultra combos and strategy ala Dominion. 

I would describe Ascension as the 'sprawled out on a deck chair while drinking a martini by the pool' kind of game. Quite relaxing.

[thing=69789][/thing] is a deck builder, but not my favorite kind of deck builder.

In your turn, you will use runes (money) to buy new cards, and attack to defeat monsters and gain honor (victory points). Everyone starts with 8 Apprentice (1 rune) and 2 Militia (1 attack). There are two basic cards that are always up for purchase: Heavy Infantry (2 attack) and Mystic (2 runes). Also, there will be always a Cultist card (needs attack 2 to be defeated) - the player can always use attack to beat the Cultist, gaining 1 honor each time.

All the other cards will come from the main deck. The cards up for purchase or to be fought will be in a central row. When a card is purchase or beaten, a new one will take its place. As usual the cards will have many effects, and I guess that all of the monsters, when defeated, will provide some sort of one time effect to be used in the same turn the player defeated the monster - things like: draw cards, banish a card from the row, gain runes, and, of course, all of them will give honor.

The game will proceed until all the honor (25 per player) ends (but players will still gain honor, there are more tokens, basically the same thing that happens in [thing=28143][/thing]). Then it will be the final round (everyone will have the same number of turns). The player with the highest amount of honor (from tokens and also from the cards - most of the cards are also worth honor) will be the winner.

The row for the cards to come in once one is fought or bought can create that sort of situation that I don't like: you got 7 to buy, but only cards of 3 or 4 value are there. So you take one of these, than a card, that you really would want, shows up, costing 6. Well, now you are screwed - specially because this great card will probably be taken by someone else.

I don't mind all that much, but this is far from optimal. Yes, the set up is made shorter this way (just shuffle everything together and you are good to go), and also the breakdown (just separate the basic cards out the decks). But this also makes strategies harder to be effective. I once bought two good cards to use on Mechanas, but none other where there when my turn was up.

Nonetheless, [thing=69789][/thing] is an easy game to get going, to teach and to play. For the art, I liked it quite a bit - it is thematic and sets a fine mood - I see some complains regarding it, but, for me, is really well done.

*****

After playing a lot - a lot - of games in the app, I can see much better the possibilities and fine tunning of the game. I enjoy it much more now, and even increased its rating from 6 to 7.

Super solid deckbuilder here. More combative than Dominion, and more reactionary. The art is a love-it-or-hate-it kind of affair but it IS well produced (as are the other non-card components). 

Just generally a great value for money box. Plays in about 30-40 and is usually quite tight.

A solid gateway game for those who like deck builders but like a little more flavor than dominion. With 2 or 3 the game feels very competitive, offering and rewarding both strategic and tactical decisions. Above that number, the game is still fun but super random. I may trade this eventually, but it's nice to be able to bring out a dominion alternative every once in a while, and ascension can be taught relatively quickly.

RATING: 6.5
Good:
-Clean design with easy rules
-Gateway game
-Cool card interactions
-Always something to do on your turn
-No significant player interaction
-More casual than most deck builders
-Unpredictability of the center row

Bad:
-Unpredictability of the center row
-Greatly improved by expansion
-Terminology can be confusing to new gamers
-Down time

Overall:
It is unfair to compare it to Dominion.  Dominion is more strategic.  The winner is the player who identified the best was to pair the cards, manage their deck, and draw well.  While Ascension is more tactical.  You buy the card that best fits into your deck from the limited choices that are constantly changing, maximize the points you can earn, and put yourself in a good position for future turns.  While Dominion is a tighter and better design with significantly less luck, it lacks the charm of Ascension.  It comes down to, do you want a game where the best strategy wins (Dominion) or one where the winner is the person who is playing well and lucky.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A better game than I expected. It certainly offers more randomness than Dominion, but the many different cards and the fact that you do not know which cards come up next make the game less dry and therefore more enjoyable than the game it took its inspiration from. And I simply love the small rulebook and the short setup time: Even with nongamers, you will be able to start their first play after maybe 10 minutes of explaining and setting up. And while I agree that the artwork could have been better, I love the fact that all the cards are by the same artist and show the same art style. Cannot wait to play again!
UPDATE: Played it quite a bit more, and still find myself surprised by the combos that come up during play. Raised my rating to an 8 - always want to play!

Played ipad version of the game and it is clear it borrows heavily from the basic structure of dominion and Magic the Gathering. I don't mind playing it online, but a physical game of Ascension will be boring and tedious. My tolerance for build your deck card games has diminished significantly after dominion.

Nothing really unique about this game mechanic-wise. A plain rethread.

Ascension is easily the best game in the deck building genre.  While it lacks massive player interaction (which seems to be more and more over the expansions) it has great mechanics, and replayability.  Well designed and exciting in solo, or up to 6 players (with expansions), no two games are the same.

A simplistic deck builder. Fast paced, and basically requires relatively little thought compared to the deck builders our group typically brings to the table. It's not particularly tiring to play, but the majority of the game is reactionary rather than strategical.

RATING: 6
App is much more superior to the physical card game due to the need for constant shuffling. The game itself has an issue with runaway leaders and more often than not the winner is quite obvious many rounds before the game ends. That being said, I still enjoy the occasional game of Ascension since it's more or less become the standard for deck builders for me.

Not the greatest rulebook. I had to go to various posts on BGG before I worked out how to play. Now I realise it is quite a simple game but not having played Dominion or Thunderstone before the mechanics were totally new to me and quite unlike any I’m used to.

Anyway having played 4 games so far we’re really enjoying it. Fast set-up, fast play and not too bad on the 'take that' meanness front. 

Love the artwork. Differs from the usual Fantasy Flight ilk  - i.e. half naked female characters with HUGE breasts and tiny everything else. You could actually play this one with your family and other adults and not cringe!

This was my first deck builder purchased after playing Legendary.  The game play is simple and easy to learn/teach to others.  This is a great travel game.  We'll take this along on a backpacking or camping trip, since the components are light and the board is not essential to game play.  On the downside, the game always feels somewhat repetitive and lacking in surprise factor without adding in expansions.

RATING: 7
A strong example of the deckbuilding genre of games.

Quicker to play than Dominion and Thunderstone.  It distinguishes itself in two ways.  

One, it moves the choices from the "strategic" to the "tactical."  With the other games in this genre, you often make most of your important decisions at the very start of the game when you choose your course of action for assembling your deck.  With Ascension, doing that is a route to failure and would probably make the game seem overly simplistic and boring.

Two, the board itself is more random, but the decks themselves are less random.  With other deckbuilding games, the composition of available cards doesn't change or only partially changes throughout the game.  With Ascension, the board changes virtually every turn, but in a random fashion.  On the flipside, Ascension's game mechanics focus much more heavily on filtering lower-quality cards out of your deck as compared to other games in the genre.

This game stands out for me because of the quickness, the ease of setting up and taking down, and the tactical depth and number of choices per minute offered to the player.  It's a different beast than Dominion - if you want the strategic "decide your buys before you start playing" nature of Dominion or Thunderstone, you probably won't like it.

Another Dominion clone that failed to evaluate what was good and bad about Dominion first, and thus was a step backwards, design wise.  less interaction, far less strategy, much more random (notably, the same errors Thunderstone made). All this in exchange for 30 seconds less set-up time.  Not a worthwhile trade off (Thunderstone traded those things for some theme instead).  Gets more and more painful every time I play it.

copied an already successful design (and un-designed most of the good things about the game), copied an already succesful marketing style (They targeted Magic players, because that's what they were familiar with, and at least didn't take backwards steps doing that, so did a decent job there).  No thanks.

RATING: 7
It's funny that this entire sub-genre of deckbuilding games with a replenishing, changing area of cards to buy (rather than Dominion's supply piles) seemed to have spawned from Ascension, when the mechanic itself was something that the designer of Dominion considered but scrapped!

It adds quite a bit of luck to the genre, but that might not be such a bad thing. Although with many players this aspect does seem to become a bit overwhelming, and it becomes impossible to plan as the communal card area changes completely by the time your turn comes around again.

In any case, Ascension is fun.

RATING: 7.5
Combat-heavy buys are superior to money-focused and the overall design and length don't end up allowing for much in the way of combos to actually happen.  In other words, I don't feel this is actually a very good game, but I've still enjoyed most of the games I've played.

Oct 2017: Rating -1 (to 8)
Lowering my rating of the base game only because I don't play this as often as the War of Shadows edition.  Valley of the Ancients is also a great game if you're playing 3-4P.  I think Mystic Vale still reigns as my favorite deckbuilder, but I would have to place Ascension above Dominion now.  The theme is fun, the monsters add a different element (even if power really is just a different currency), and your score at the end depends upon both your honor points (gems) and the honor on all the cards you've collected.  That means virtually every card you pick up matters - not just in how your game plays out but in your final score.  Sometimes it's worth picking up a high point card you don't *need* just to get those points.  The different factions and synergy between them also takes it a stop above Dominion, because they contribute to your overall strategy.  (Especially if you're using an expansion that has things like Unite powers.)

Original, Dec 2016:
One of my favorite games and probably falls right behind Dominion for my favorite deck builder.

Art is great, theme plays across very well.  I love that it incorporates two elements: buying (runes) and kill monsters (power).  Sometimes the cards that lay out on the board will have no monsters when you have a bunch of power, and sometimes there won't be anything useful you can buy.  There's some luck there, but otherwise it's largely strategy.  Do you want to focus on buying valuable cards that yield honor points every turn or at the end of the game?  Or maybe you'd rather focus heavily on military power and kill monsters for your honor points?  It seems like a balance between the two usually pans out best, but we've had games where one person does very well just buying tons of constructs and other games where one person does well building up a strong military.

My parents also love this game.  It was slightly confusing at first and they still have to ask "what does this card do?" sometimes, but it's one they've added to their own collection and enjoy playing alone.  I'd say this plays well with 2-4 players.  2 players is faster but still fun.  4 players can drag out a little if you have indecisive people, but gets better as everyone playing knows the game.

Would like to get Return of the Fallen and possibly War of Shadows.

The common simplification floating around about this is "[gameid=36218] with a dark fantasy theme," which is pretty accurate  There's an additional type of currency, and there aren't the restrictions to one buy, but the core mechanic of buy cards to put into your deck so you can buy better cards is unchanged.  I think this one is probably a bit more forgiving and luck-driven, and it's not so easy to find an easy strategy from the beginning of the game, which I actually prefer.  You're constantly assailed with new choices as new cards get flipped over, which means the game doesn't feel like a long resolution after the card set is revealed at the beginning like Dominion does.

The theme for this game also helps.  This feels like a real world, with the factions each having a cohesive feel.  Even the sometimes campy colored-pencil art that looks like it came straight out of a high-school notebook helps.  I'll always prefer a real setting, as opposed to the generic crap that Dominion does.  Duchy? Pfft.

Rating is for the entire Ascension series. It seems so simple but can be very complex and satisfying. Victory is dependent on point-accumulation, which can be attained through various strategies.

I belong to those people who almost hate this game art. After getting used with the MTG art standard is hard not to judge everything else from that perspective. Art is indeed getting better as they release new expansions, but still has a long way to go imho. If it wasn't for the game mechanics I wouldn't have played this at all. It is indeed a deck builder with heavy Dominion influence, and this is expectable since Dominion was the main inspiration for the designers. Even though the game is trying to balance the first turn advantage it feels that luck and getting the first turn many times is decisive. This might happen because once a player gets momentum I found hard to stop it, slow it down or catch up somehow with him. I enjoy playing this occasionally and the game is indeed very fun to play. If you enjoy deck builders add this to your list as well.

Passable as a deck-building game, but it suffers in a couple of ways:  first, drafting from a common pool that's in constant flux can make this game VERY luck dependent; second, there are a lot of serious card balance issues.  These two flaws combine to make some games of Ascension a foregone conclusion.  I rate it as highly as I do because the digital version is a fantastic time waster.

PERMANENT PLACE IN COLLECTION (WITH EXPANSIONS)

UPDATE: Dec 2012. Increased rating from 7 to 8. Back playing compulsively on the iPad. Not sure why I like this game so much.

Great tactical deck-building game with gorgeous artwork. Played about four million times on the iPad before I bought the physical game.

It's quick and fun. Love this game. Much easier to learn than Dominion, more thematic and tactical. But the replay value is limited. After playing the base game and first expansion numerous times, I knew every card and could win constantly.

I still haven't mastered the latest expansion, but have stopped playing for the moment due to burnout.

There are things I like about this game, and there are things that I don't like about this game.  The weird thing is that those things are both related to the main core mechanism of the game, which is the single row of cards that's available to players, instead of having a full tableau of different cards from which to choose.  On the one hand, I think it's a nice alternative to Dominion, where you wind up getting a few cards that aren't as useful as you want them to be; on the other hand, it's a little annoying to draw a hand full of attack cards, and have nothing but triangles in the row.  The use of the Mystics, Fighters, and Cultists allow for something to always be available, and there's a nice balance of getting points from killing monsters and getting points for buying cards, but sometimes you want something better.  It becomes more of a tactical game than a strategic one, and ultimately it comes down to developing a good strategy based on the luck of the draw.  As such, I think it probably plays better as a 2-player game than a multiplayer one.  Still, it's a fun game that owes a lot to Dominion without feeling like that's the case.  Or maybe I'm just accustomed to shuffling a whole bunch of cards in games by now.

Love this game.  It's my favorite deck builder.  No telling how many times I've played the app version.  As far as the tabletop version, the components are exceptional.  The cards are very high quality and, I know some don't like the art but I love it.  It is different than any other game and is very creative and interesting.  I like that the game comes with a board.  This is something they didn't have to do but it adds to the experience.  I also love the acrylic honor tokens. Again, they could have just used cardboard tokens but chose to use something more substantial.  Even the box is of very high quality.  In terms of gameplay, its simple mechanically but provides an impressive amount of options.  Finding just the right cards to purchase so you have that epic turn is so satisfying!  I'm sure I will be purchasing the various expansions as I just can't get enough of this one.

Ascension is a fast paced deckbuilding game designed by Magic™ Pro Tour champions Justin Gary, Rob Dougherty, and Brian Kibler, with artwork by Eric Sabee. Ascension is a deck-building game where players spend Runes to acquire more powerful cards for their deck. It offers a dynamic play experience where players have to react and adjust their strategy accordingly.
\13\\13\
Gameplay is similar to other deckbuilding games, with the player adding cards to their deck by purchasing them from a central deck, which has the top six cards revealed and available for purchase. When cards are removed, they are replaced with a new one from the top of the deck. Victory points are earned in three ways: firstly, each card purchased is worth one or more victory points; second, victory points can be gained by defeating monsters with a power resource featured on several of the cards; finally, some cards give victory points directly each time they are played.

Good tactical game. It's interesting that I like it even as much as I do, given that deck-building games are by nature strategic, and the amount of randomness in this one means that your strategy could easily fall to ruins. There's enough meaningful choice here that it's reasonably interesting, and this may not be a fair comparison, but I'd much rather play Dominion or Thunderstone than this. (I did like it more than Arctic Scavengers and Puzzle Strike.)

I've played over 800 games of Ascension on iOS, with various combinations of expansions, and all with friends I know in meatspace. The Playdek app is really fantastic--the best card game app I've played.

Ascension itself is an OK-to-pretty-good deckbuilder. It seems silly to be so lukewarm on a game I've played so much, but I really think it's the convenience of being able to make a move in any random moment (in 5-6 concurrent games) that got me here, rather than a particular strength of the game itself.

The changing board makes the game more dynamic than Dominion in the sense that you can't solve it ahead of time, then just execute your plan. On the other hand, the changing board rarely leads to hard decisions, so it adds more randomness than tactical depth.

All that said, I'm still enjoying the game after all these plays, when many other game apps have come and gone. It's light but pleasant, and so so easy to pick up, take a few turns, and put away.

RATING: 3
Overall a very weak game, where people play in isolation and have very few difficult decisions. Able to be won with out basic game knowledge. 

I won my first game without reading any of the cards before I purchased them - I just built my purchasing power and then bought the most expensive cards I could afford.

Very disappointing.

A very light and fun deck building game which sets up and plays a lot quicker than other deck building games currently available.  That said there are a few minor quality issues when it comes to the card production, but these can be "covered up" with the use of quality card protectors.

I have played this game a few times now.  Mostly on the iPad version where it works really well.  The computer keeps track of all the book keeping that really gets in the way of the game.

RATING: 6
As a pure deck-building game, it isn't bad. It distinguishes itself from Dominion by having two forms of currency. But when boiled down to the basics, it's still a very average and uninspired experience to play.

The iOS version is actually much preferable because it strips away all of the annoying elements of deck-builders (setup, shuffling, score-tallying) and leaves you with a very quick, distilled game of building card combos.

Again, I don't think Ascension is deficient in any particular respect except that it has been overshadowed for me by other games that offer more theme and more interesting game play (Legendary). As such, I consider it very "middle of the road".

[u]Update:[/u] I finally did it. I broke the game engine. I played a game where I cycled the entire deck and reached 2305 points before I had to shut it off due to the late hour. I probably could have gone considerably higher than that. I had easily 170 cards in my deck, 46 constructs on the table and had accumulated over 2700 combat thanks to a pair of Moon Staves. Yep. Broke the game. It was pretty cool to watch and I'm sad I didn't get to play the rest of it out.

Originally a blast. Was rated 10 in my collection. Then as new sets came out, the older sets became obsolete. Newer cards are much much more powerful than the older set.

Another bastard son of Dominion.
It's simple and plays quite fast, and this is very good.
I am almost sure it has no replayability, all the games will probably look much the same, and this is quite bad !

If you care about art, i find the illustrations on the cards quite bad, but this is just my personal taste.

As a deckbuilder, I find this game entertaining but slightly too reliant on luck to match some of the better games in the genre. Also, the art style isn't particularly to my taste. If it weren't for the solitaire variant, it probably would lose out completely to Dominion or Arctic Scavengers.

The randomness of the supply card flops makes strategy near impossible. Adding players just increases chaos and randomness as the supply can entirely change multiple times between turns.  A well-thought strategy on one turn can completely screw you 2 turns later when the supply has completely changed.  The only good strategy is to be mediocre at everything, and that's boring.  Player interaction is minimal.  The game honestly seems to consist solely of hoping you draw the right attack and rune (money) cards for whatever happens to be in the supply on your turn.

My face gets frowny when a player wins the game because an endgame bonus card earns her a staggering 25 points. Someone please explain why, under these circumstances, the first 95% of the game was even necessary.

If you can't a refund will do just fine.

At least Ascension's theme is better than Dominion's, though it would be impossible not to be.

Finally, I imagine the game would be more fun if each player didn't spend 2-3 squinty minutes poring over the text of every card. Let's play quickly, shall we?

I don't get this game.  Every time I have played it seems to be a deck builder with no strategy.  Of the items in the tableau, there is always a "best card" to take.  Trying to stick to a "faction" has never been successful for me.  

So I'm saying this game has no interesting decisions to make.

I really like Ascension. It's sloppy, and you can't play it with a bunch of people, and the art is weird, and the games take too long, but there's something about it that I love, but that I can't quite place a finger on besides "it's a deckbuilder."

Strategy is at a minimum due to it's sole mechanic being random, and yet you can hardly distinguish one play from the next.  Its so simple that you can play it while carrying on two intellectual conversations and watching TV, which makes it not deep enough to want to play in almost any other situation. This game is great on the iPhone, as it seems appropriately casual.

Pros : The production value is good.  The single mechanic the game possesses is very streamlined.  It plays through very quickly.

Cons : Not enough game.  randomness > thinkitude.

[microbadge=19675] Sent this game to [user=phinfan2003]
as part of the [geeklist=193365]Pay it Forward First[/geeklist] geeklist. I'm so happy that I finally found something to give this game to, as it's in great collection and doesn't get played. 

For awhile I was hard on this game, but after playing it on my iPad some, I found (perhaps unsurprisingly) it greatly benefits from expansions. Sadly, there are other deckbuilders I like more, so I would never have gotten enough of the hard copy expansions to make it a game I'd like to play regularly (I have many of the expansions on my iPad). Sara seems very excited to receive this, so I'm glad it's going to a good home! One of the first handful of games that started our epic collection, so I will always think of the game fondly, despite the lack of plays.

I've played a lot of the iOS version and really enjoyed it. Plays quickly and cleanup is very simple because you don't have to sort much. I like how the center row is ever-changing and it's a fast, tactical game. I'm hoping playing the physical copy will allow me to learn it a little better and form some deeper strategy.

Playing face-to-face, I'm having a hard time grasping a grand strategy. Right now it boils down to "buy the good cards" but I don't really know what's good. Monster pileups seem to slow most games down as well. 

I want to play a bit more and see if I can get the hang of it but I'm enjoying Star Realms at 2-players more, although they're very similar. I'd also like to check out 3-player.

maybe there's a little "growing used to" room in the rating.  but it really seems like just a very chaotic version of Dominion, but without the deep strategic game play.  You can basically play any cards in your hand, and there are many attack cards that put cards in play back in your discard.  The combos are very tactical due to the random nature of the availability.

Quickly becoming my favorite deck building game.  It certainly is the one I am playing the most these days.  Two things that I really love about it that sets it apart.  1: The fact that every game uses every card and 2: The Artwork is so unique!  I really love this illustrators style.  It actually gives the game its own distinct look that really sets it apart from all the generic fantasy themed games out there.

Take Dominion, remove restrictions(like buying only one card), remove any kind of interaction and add another resource. This game didn't do for me

Ascension is fine for what it is. It's your typical deckbuilder. You're likely best getting something that suits your thematic tastes.

An ok game, that is quick to set up and play, but had some serious downsides. I felt the art was a bit bland and the game had VERY little strategy at 4 players... never felt the better player one, only the luckiest. Perhaps 2 or 3 players lacks this problem, but it is very apparent in 4.

I have only played this a couple of times but I enjoyed it. It is pretty typical of a deck-building game.

I was expecting a cross between Thunderstone and Magic, but this was much closer to a fantasy themed Dominion.  Surprisingly no player interaction or conflict and very few combats against monsters.  Seemed funny to collect all these heroes and then use then not do much with them other than use them to buy more heroes and collect honor for buying them.

I was pleasantly surprised by my extreme fondness of this game after just one play!  Of course after playing it a few times since, my feelings have not changed and I am happy to report Ascension has what it takes to make it the most enjoyable deck building game next to Dominion!  

The game components are very attractive and visually appealing and I know many gamers stated their dislike of the artwork, but I thoroughly enjoy it.  I think it compliments the game nicely.

With expansions on the way, I am sure the replayability factor will only increase and make the game even more enjoyable with each subsequent play.

An attempt at a simple deckbuilder by a trio of Magic pros.  Eh, it's okay, but feels more luck-dependent than any of the other entries in the field, and some of the card types play counter-intuitively.  

I won't object to the occasional game but I won't seek it out.

Aha!  Finally!  A [thing=36218]Dominion[/thing] descendant that can maintain the [i]pace[/i] of [thing=36218]Dominion[/thing].  The central, revolving meat market prevents you from much planning before your turn, even though you can see your hand the whole round, but since there are only the six cards to inspect, it doesn't create too much downtime at the starts of players' turns.  The designers' [thing=463][/thing] experience shows in some of the card designs, providing some nice synergy, and it gets the players' gears turning.  Finally, the iconography and formatting of the cards is solid and consistent, facilitating fast play.

Great game and still a wonderful gateway into the deckbuilding genre. However, if you've played it a bunch of times, it's easy to get the gist of what works and what doesn't, limiting its replay value.

Probably my favorite deck-building game. Sets up very fast and offers very good gameplay. While some complain about the artwork I actually think its very cool.

For a Dominion rip-off, it's not too bad.  A good time once you get the rules and mechanics down (which aren't difficult).  Play three turns and then start the game over.  Also make sure the Cultist stays in that spot on the board all game.

Oh yeah... the rules aren't very well written.

The original (although I have the 3rd Edition) center-row / river-style deck-building game! While it may have lost some luster by not having shiny new mechanisms of later sets, something has to be said for how well the base mechanisms of Ascension work.

I liked this one more than dominion.  NOt sure I liked it enough to buy it.  seemed fairly luck dependent - a lot was riding on what cards came up and when.

Ascension gets old quickly. It's a Solitaire deckbuilder that has the worst kind of runaway winner problem that makes the end game simply torture to play through.

RATING: 8
This is a great deck builder with some refreshing mechanics thrown in. Games usually end up pretty close in honour tokens, leaving it to the card VPs to decide the game. Adds a lot of mystery to who will win, yet makes a point that you need to get as many VP cards as possible nearing the end of a game.

After 5+ Plays: I'm not the world's biggest dominion fan, but I can see the cleverness in the design.  This game removes that cleverness.  The one action/one buy restrictions are what made dominion interesting, and here they are removed without adding anything to take their place.  The biggest decision here is the balance to be struck between the two currency types, but the currency you'll need is hard to predict, so even this decision is pretty hollow.  Despite my dislike I'll probably continue to play this on occasion, as vetoing it and choosing another game is more hassle than just wasting a half-hour.

Ascension is a bastard child of Thunderstone. The mechanics are largely similar, but the game itself is much easier to teach and learn. You get some mana and some attack, then use it to buy/kill things in the centre row, which is 6 cards that are drawn from a single draw deck.

Unlike Thunderstone, the deck buffs and the monsters come from the same deck. This gives you less control over how you shape your deck, as at times there may only be 1 or 2 non-supply deck buff cards that you can buy. The single draw deck can sometimes stall a game even further by having an early stream of expensive cards or hard-to-kill monsters, leaving all the players unable to properly streamline their deck with improvements in order to proceed.

One advantage to Ascension is how easy it is to teach/learn. If you are teaching someone that has played nearly any deckbuilder before, the instructions last about 30 seconds.

I like Ascension best with 2 players, as I find with more than that your centre row control goes right out the window. With 2 players it is more like a tactical duel, as any time you buy/kill something, you're freeing up a centre row spot that might give your opponent something awesome. With more than 2 the centre row is much less stable, and sometimes with 4 players you won't even see many of the cards that cycle through.

Phew, this game was a HUGE hit with the wife and I! I was scared it was going to sit unplayed for two months, but after watching a video it only took me a day or so to bust it out.

A very simple deck building game that plays fast. The game has amazing and unique art and fills the same flavor as Magic the gathering without endlessly spending money. Definitely recommend

RATING: 6
This is a fun, quick game that is simple to set up, fairly easy to explain and manages to make the fun of playing cards primary to the mechanic of deck-building, which I think a lot of the other deck-building games miss. It's like they figure out all the ins and outs of how the deck will be built, then start worrying about making the game playable and "fun", as opposed to an exercise in effeciency. Still, if that's your thing, this might not have enough legs to support that experience. Try this if you like card games with action cards/special powers. Deck-building comes second.

RATING: 3
A rotating tableau of cards you can buy, instead of a fixed set you can plan a strategy around, is stupid and the worst trend in deck-building games. I'm so glad I learned Dominion first, or I might have never given the genre a second glance.

RATING: 9
Although I still have very limited play experience with both this and Dominion, I think I might eventually end up liking this one better.

At first, I thought the limited/random nature of the center row would be a disappointing aspect and make it a dumbed-down variant of Dominion, but I have since realized it should be considered like a draft, instead (which I like a lot in most other CCGs).

I will try to get more games in and give a more-detailed review...

EDIT:
Currently my favorite deckbuilding game.

Being a fan of limited formats in CCGs, this felt like a natural move for me.

The expansions add interesting mechanics and make different strategies viable (with the first set, it's mostly limited to card drawing and combat isn't really good).

Will definitely be acquiring the new standalone soon.

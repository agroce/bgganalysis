RATING: 8.5
I need to play this more, but it is a really fun game. The production value is great, and once you get going, it's a very intuitive and exciting racing game to find the most treasure. I just wish it got played more than Jamaica - as that is a similarly designed game (way different mechanics - just art style seems similar), with a similar win condition. But this one deserves a spot on the shelf too.

A lot of fun, we've played this with several groups of friends and everyone has enjoyed it. The variety of map layouts and treasure clues allow each game to play out differently, and the production quality is great (particularly the map and the idols). Although it's quite simple and easy to pick up, there's also more depth than might appear at first glance (e.g., the order in which clues are played against a given treasure determines the bidding order for the treasure cards, and the amulets scattered across the island can be used in a variety of ways). Highly recommended!

An interesting take on deduction and action management.  The various mechanics were interesting, and I love the wooden jeeples.  The game was pretty good, although I can see where luck of the draw for the clue cards could be a little swingy, and also being near an amulet when it appears is a nice advantage.

The reverse deduction part in this game is clever and really fun! On top of that, the quality of the game material is top notch, nice wooden and even stone(!) pieces. Plus I haven't seen a better insert in any game than this one. The way you put the components in and on top of each other, you lock them all securely in place.

All in all, this is a well done game!

Interesting logic puzzle that I would like to get the kids playing at some point soon. This Essen release is simply BEAUTIFULLY produced by Zoch, and I sincerely believe that it has SdJ written all over it for 2010. It certainly fits many of the categories they desire.

The game plays quickly, is beautiful -- as previously stated -- and is great for teaching logic to kids. What's not to like? Oh... and it's FUN! Total win, even if it's a bit light for my tastes.

On the complexity level, we're in the same realms as Takenoko. It's family-friendly, non-gamer friendly, girlfriend-friendly stuff. A beautiful board and components, a nice theme, and good simple mechanics. This isn't taxing but it is fun. There are decisions to be made so it isn't all luck. There are opportunities to interfere with your opponents' plans, but it's never an aggressive game. 

Traded after two plays - decisions were too simple for my taste. Received Thurn und Taxis (with two expansions) in return -  a fantastic deal!

RATING: 5.5
Surprisingly complex for such a fun theme, so I don't see this as an easy gateway style family game at all. The clues for locating treasure is original and fun, but is a bit of a brain burner at the start (especially so when you can't quite put marking cubes out). The ATV movement is also more complex than needed. Still, fun theme, richly produced with a creative variable board set up. In sum: it's alright, but I'm not sure how many plays it will have with my game group and it's likely too complex for family play. Probably going on the trade pile.

RATING: 6
Lives in the niche of heavy family games, especially with the expert rules. Basically there is only a choice between two possible actions on each turn. However, there is a zillion things you can do with the amulets. It is hard to memorize them all.

Tobago look good and plays rather well. At some points you might experience analysis paralysis to a certain degree but it's not because of the myriad of choices rather than because of trying to figure out whether you have any legal moves.

I have a feeling that the rating might rise once I get more plays under my belt so that I can fully concentrate on tactics.

This game needs more mini blocks. I don't understand why they did not just add in 5 or so more of each colour. It seems ridiculous not to include them. Even the rule book states that you should just remember where the blocks go until you have eliminated enough to not have to remember the handful of invisible ones. 

Apart from the design flaw it is a good game. 

Boring for 2 people, definitely needs more players to make getting the gold more exciting.

RATING: 7.33
A good family game, and one which I'll enjoy playing as my son gets a little older.

Also has an interesting reverse deduction element which is good for kids.  For adults, I find it a little on the lighter side than what I normally enjoy for the amount of time invested--but I still enjoy getting it out for the treasure-hunting theme and because it is fun to make that grinding noise while the statutes rotate.  

Much more enjoyable with three or four players.

This game is really, really refreshing. It's light enough for everyone to enjoy and just deep enough to have some fun strategy. The expanded amulet rules seem great and I plan on playing with them the next time I table this one.

RATING: 8
A clever and altogether unique game with excellent components and a elegant design. Tobago is a deductive game unlike anything I have seen before. You play a group of treasure hunters (who drive around in little SUV meeples!) who are (sort of) working together just enough to deduce where there is treasure on the island you are exploring. The more each member contributes to deducing a treasures location, the larger their share of treasure will be when it is ultimately discovered. Beware the cursed treasure though, as it can really ruin a treasure hunters day. The island is also littered with plenty of amulets (delivered by cool stone easter island looking staue components!) that you can use for different things to benefit you on your search. The game is not difficult to learn or teach. There are few rules and the mechanics are simple. Definitely a OOP game worth adding to your collection.

FAVOURITE GAME - Tobago is a treasuring hunting game where players use their and their opponents clues to find a treasures exact location. Some of treasures are cursed and only the help of the Amulets will protect them. But these amulets have other magical powers as well. The player with the most gold will win the game! The beautifully illustrated game board and top-quality game pieces enhance the allure and mystery of this inventive and exhilarating game. Each player contributes valuable clues which determine where the treasures are located. The excitement mounts as the adventurers strive to be the first to arrive at the treasure sites. The 3-piece game board with its innovative design can be set up with 32 different scenarios, each providing fun and a new challenge.

1st play: Great production, mid-weight logic/deduction game that plays quickly and encourages team-work through shared objectives.  Sometimes, the best plays might be to throw down a clue that doesn't really help solve the treasure hunt but gets you into the splitting of the loot.  Pulling the curses is brutal, and can make the game swingy, but it's short enough that I don't mind.  I do think the logic portion may push it out of family-game range, but a nice fast game that's not like other games I own.

2nd play: Plays in under an hour which makes it a nice quick game.  The main problem this game has is that the logic puzzles are slightly too complex for non-gamer types to enjoy, and not quite complex enough for gamer types.  The treasures are fairly random, which is ok given the length.  I still like the production and I can see pulling this out at the end of the night as a group pick.

Excellent game! Straightforward rules, but can be a brain burner as you try to outwit the other player in a 2 player game (not sure if it's as strategic with 3-4 players).

Very memorable and a keeper.

Very unique and fun family game. I especially like the 'searching' mechanism. It works very well especially since it is very hard to load up on a single treasure AND get there to pick it up. Makes for a balanced game. The components are really nice and the game play falls in that relatively quick family game range. Solid game.

A very, VERY strange game. There is just SOOOO much to take into consideration when making your move, but it really is just a deep version of a push-your-luck game. Weird. And (believe it or not) there IS the potential for analysis paralysis in it! The tension level is very high and constant (except for the first few turns, perhaps), and all kinds of games of psychological brinksmanship are going on between the players. It is highly interactive, and uniquely "enforced cooperative": it doesn't matter what action you choose to take, it will benefit somebody else in some way! I really like that. Tobago is one of the best themed games I have ever played....so well themed that it really needs a soundtrack. 
The best treasure hunting game I have ever played!
AND, on a relatively minor note, the plastic insert is actually quite useful! EVERYTHING fits in perfectly, and the board sections keep everything from jumping out of place.

I really enjoy this game. Yes, it has a deduction element to it but not in the "I know something you don't" sense; more of a "where are we going to bury the treasure" sense (i.e. deduction in reverse).

Scoring is a bit chaotic but I didn't care, the enjoyment of the game comes from figuring out where the treasure is.

Definitely some interesting aspects to this game.  I don't like how the lakes are just like any other land type (i.e. you can drive through them, palm trees can be in them, etc.).  It is also a little taxing to have to constantly deduce what spaces might have the treasures.  Nevertheless, this provides a satisfying, unique experience.  I also like the mechanic for hauling in your treasure (i.e. "raising treasures"), and think it's quite clever.

I cannot stand this game. I am almost sure I am missing something, but it seems to me that no one wants to square away where the treasure is because as soon as they do someone else will grab it. An exercise in frustration for me.

Most deduction games are all about who-dun-its or some such silliness.  This game takes the classic deduction concept and uses it as a mid-stream mechanism.  Reaching the answer is not the end of the story.  That fact makes this design quite interesting.  A familiar concept is leveraged in a new way.  Combine the ideas with very well made components, clear rules, and you have a title that really should be highly approachable to many families.  Easily should have made it into the SdJ finalists for 2009.  No clue why it didn't.

Nice concept, but lackluster execution. It just drags too long for such a seemingly simple game. The "deduction" part feels too complicated for what it is, and even I, who usually plays on instinct, can fall to AP here. That's definitely not a good sign.

Anyone who says this is a fun family games certainly didn't take on the tedious logistician/statistician role.  Anyone who played with me certainly didn't have fun if I was assigned in the logistician/statistician role.  I'm not a mathematician, but I think that equates to a lose/lose situation if I am in the game.

Top components and board game illustrations!! The board is modular, so it can create loads of different games, great. Play 'clue cards' to 1 of the 4 treasures available, to narrow the possible locations of the treasure, when the treasure is found you rush to it and dig it out. Whoever has more clue cards played has the largest share of the treasure, unless it is haunted! Good replayability.
The rules could have been better explained especially the part that concerns picking up treasures and/or using talisman tokens to get extra actions.

A light and simply family game with a nice mix of mechanics and an enticiing theme. Production values of this game are very high. A really good choice for encouraging slightly older children into gaming with simply be effective tactical decision making Taken for what it is it is an excellent game that will appeal to many people. Love the stone figure heads - what a nice touch.

I can see Tobago have success among non-gamers: it has awesome components and easy gameplay. I sometimes like a lighter game for after-dinner with non-gaming friends, but I don't see Tobago played over Ticket to Ride or Catan... It's an ok game, but it's not my cup of tea (I don't really like the way treasures are given)...

RATING: 5
very interesting mechanic, but in the end the game is full of pseudo-decisions.  the final winning score is ~30 points, yet you might easily loose 10+ points with 1 unlucky card draw, and just as easily see endgame where which treasure happens to be the last one means a swing of 10+ points for me or for my opponent. 20+ points difference in the last move or two when the end score is 30-35... all that means that while mechanically the game is interesting, I am not tempted to play again.

would be a 4, but the core mechanic is fun enough to bump this o notch.

Eerste keer gespeeld op de beurs en onmiddellijk gekocht.
Het spel heeft enkele originele invalshoeken: een beetje coöperatief, maar uiteindelijk spaart ieder toch zijn eigen geld.
We gaan allemaal samen op zoek naar schatten, en leggen kaarten waardoor de plaats van de schat alsmaar duidelijker wordt.
Wie meehielp om de schat te vinden, wordt beloond.  Eerst mag die even snuffelen aan de cadeau's, maar uiteindelijk worden deze toch weer random verdeeld.

Aandacht spelregels!

[COLOR=#959595][SIZE=7]Spiel des Jahres Recommendation 2010[/SIZE][/COLOR]

[i]Posted: 6/29/10, Rated: 8[/i]

In an age of [thing=36128]deck building[/thing], I was very curious to see how a game could implement a "build a treasure map" mechanic.  How would [i]Tobago[/i] provide multiple puzzles to solve if they were being determined as the game progressed?  I had to find out.  More importantly, I thought the idea was cool.

That's an important detail: I really liked the idea of this game before I ever opened it.  I started with a positive bias.

As a result, I was fascinated when I saw how the board can be assembled in theoretically 32 different ways.  The iconology for the clues, and the method of constructing the "treasure maps" are brilliantly simple.  The moai-esque statue figures are fantastic.  The ATV movement feels very similar to the token movement in [i][thing=855]Java[/thing][/i].  The treasure "auctions" are a novel way to distribute points, and players have to balance their contributions to each treasure.

The artwork is highly saturated, and pleasing.  I was immediately reminded of two other [company=87]Zoch Verlag[/company] games: [i][thing=15817]Manila[/thing][/i], and [i][thing=13308]Niagara[/thing][/i]; [person=12587]Victor Boden[/person] was the artist for all three titles.  I am a fan of his work.

With a few tweaks, [i]Tobago[/i] could be a "9:" first, treasure cards which are not revealed should be discarded without looking at them.  If this means a curse card gets into the discard deck, then so be it.  Second, unused amulets ought to have some point value, otherwise the whole amulet mechanism feels bolted-on.  As is, [i]Tobago[/i] is an enjoyable discovery with a novel concept.  It can easily be taught to new players, and that is a treasure indeed.

RATING: 8
I really liked this game.  I found it just plain FUN.

The only problem I did have with this game itself, wasn't that everything was 'lucky', it's just that it seemed to reward people who would do anything to put a clue somewhere down, a little much.

That is, sure, even if a card eliminates only one cube, that's still more of a slice of the pie to be in on.  So the key?  LOTS OF SLICES.

Although, I did only win by like 9% on my first and only game.

As for the experience...  a good game to have around, but I can't see the 15th play being any different for me than the 5th.  There's skill, to be sure, but the overall experience of the game I don't know if I see opening-up and basically just kind of going through the motions.

Gorgeous family game with a great theme to capture the imagination of kids and adults alike. The union of theme and mechanics is not that great but due to the great components you do get in the treasure hunting mindset. Searching for the treasure is great fun and the treasure distribution is also very well designed. Game can be played casually with kids or more cutthroat with adults. Either way it's a great way to spend an hour.

Probably one of the most unusual and unique games I've ever come across.  It seems that the bulk of the intrigue surrounding this game comes down to the induction process where players are trying to narrow down where the treasures might be.  The variable setup of the board is very cool as well, and the components are top notch.

I think the only real downside to the game is that the rules are somewhat counter-intuitive.  Non-gamers will not catch on right away, and in some cases it may take more than one full game for them to catch up.  The nice thing is that players can work together a little bit because the play of one player's cards doesn't necessarily affect the play of another player.  With some hand-holding I think this game could be a real gem, and I may at some point decide to pick up a copy.

My rating is based on a 2-player game.  I'm not sure I would want to play this with 3, and definitely not with 4 -- it would just be too random and filled with downtime.

Having said that, the 2-player game is a fantastic puzzley game for 2 players.  You mostly control what's going on, and can use amulets effectively.

The pieces and board are beautiful and make it fun to play. (This is assuming you've gotten all of your pieces and they don't have defects.  This seems hard to do with this game.  my copy had missing brown cubes and one sheet of chits so off-center that the symbols were off the edges of the chits by a good 1/4 inch)

This game and Lost Valley are my all-time favorite family games. Your choices in Tobago are really wide open and there are opportunities for cleaver play. It isn't super deep but it is fun and it looks great.  

Update:
I've played 10-12 games now. I thought I would lose interest in this one but I have grown to like it more. Raised it from an 8 to 8.5. I'm tempted to rate it a 9 but the game is just so darn simple and there is a good deal of luck.

The tactics are subtle but they are there. You do your best to nudge each treasure towards your side of the island. You set yourself up to grab amulets.  You try and get the most out of every turn. Each turn you have a hand full of decent options. The trick is figuring out which of those options is slightly better for you and if, perhaps, there is a super clever move hidden within your options (hey, look at that. I just totally stole that treasure from you). I’m curious to see how I will feel after another 10 plays.

More than anything this game feels unique and for me that's a big deal. 

Update: I've played at least 20 games now and I still really enjoy the game. It's not super deep but I always have fun playing it. We play with the variant that lets you place 2 compass roses when you dig up a treasure (we don't place a rose on initial clue cards to keep game length the same). This variant makes claiming treasures much more important.

I'm a bit embarrassed but I have to raise this one to a "9". It is really just a family game but it is so thematic and clever I just have to give it a top score. It is a game I like to pull out to show people that board games can actually be a really cool way to spend an evening. It is a fantastic gateway game!

Early days but Tobago might take over the role as primary gateway game.  However suspect that it doesn't have long term stratgic depth, and the impact of raising treasures might introduce too much randomness. Overall love the theme.  Great family game.  . 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Interesting, somewhat unique.

I like chaotic, random games, but this has a weird mix.  Everything comes down to the treasure cards that range from (if memory serves) 1 to 6 gold.  That's far too varied a result and has far more effect on who wins than practically any decisions the player makes.  I feel the game would be better of the range was more like 5 to 10 maybe, so the swings aren't as ridiculous.

This problem is exacerbated when played with only two players.  When it's easy for treasures to be finished completely by one player, the results are [u]far[/u] too varied -- when one player gets a curse, the other gets 6,6,5, what can you do?  I strongly discourage play with just two.

Again, I like family games, and I like luck-driven, chaotic games, but I don't like this one.  At least it's pretty.

I don't know if Tobago is worth the heaps of praise that have been thrown upon it lately, but it certainly is good. Like most of the best gateway/family euros, there are only a couple of options per turn (drive your atv, or play a treasure map card), but each option opens up a slew of possible actions (which card to play and which treasure to play it on?; where to drive?).
My only issue with Tobago is that it might be a bit too simple for serious gamers, and a bit too difficult for gateway gamers.  
Hit the table 3 times in 3 days so far, which says a lot in a collection that receives between 2 - 10 new games a week (Hey! That's my job!)

Very interesting mechanic where players are playing cards to narrow down and choose the location of the treasures. Thematically, you are reassembling pieces of maps. The other mechanics (moving your vehicle and drafting treasure cards) just aren't as interesting. The game pieces and boards are very cool. I wish there was more variety to the treasure cards than just different coin amounts and two curses. Maybe adding a set collection element to make it more variable and interesting. I will play it occasionally but it is very repetitive. It lasts a little longer than it should. It works best with three or four players.

Not really a deduction game, as I was originally led to believe.  It's an enjoyable and interactive abstract game that has some puzzle (process of elimination) and race elements.  Not exactly a meaty/gamer's game, but a decent family game none-the-less.

decent quick playing game with a couple of clever mechanics to allow you to collect cash. All you have to do is narrow down locations of where you could find treasure, ideally giving yourself the best chance to actually go collect it or have put in lots of "clues" as that gives you more picks of the cash pile. 

There's amulets to collect to give addtiional go's or avoid curses which sit in the treasure pile.

Not sure how much variety there is in it as it's pretty simple to work out the ways to use the amulets to their best but it was a fun game.

This is another brilliant "entry" level game with a neat-o set-reduction mechanic.  I like everything about this game except I wish it would play 5 players, and I wish the rules about amulet use were more nailed down, and I _HATE_ how devastating the curse cards are.  I am definitely going to house-rule something to tone down the curse cards.  I like the idea of the curses, but in the end they can really just ruin a player's chances in the game.  I'm not sure exactly how I want to change them yet.

Amulet powers can be a little confusing and difficult to teach without context, but otherwise a very fun game full of adventure and deduction. There's surprisingly more strategy than I thought which makes this an original and welcome addition to the collection. The 4-player cap means it may have trouble getting to the table, but it's a wonderful family game I hope to keep for years to come. 

The components are nice and really add to the feel of the theme. It's a complete game in many ways. I have only played it with the maximum 4 players, so I'll reserve a resore until I have the opportunity to see how well it scales to 3 or even 2 players.

I traded this away; when my kids don't even want to play it it's time to say goodbye.

It's a fun, light game.  The game does tend to end too abruptly, where the treasure deck runs out faster than you think it would.  Great components, I just wish it had more depth to it.
A couple of plays in I realized that each successive play seemed identical to the previous, despite supposedly having different play on how the map and objects are laid out.  Not only that, luck played a huge part into the game, so much so that it almost destroyed any level of strategy.
Variants may help save the game over time if someone can figure out how to turn it into a more strategically balanced game.

Bit pDull and played  too long, that might have been the map and the players! - It's too chaotic for my tastes and probably a bit too complicated to be a true family game. Fully understand why others like it (nice bits) just didn't do it for me.

Didn't feel the theme worked either. Willing to try it again just in case I've missed something.

Deductive reasoning, turned into a game. The movement system is a little counterintuitive, and dividing up the treasure is a little "game-y". But the underlying mechanic is genius, and the game is well implemented. And the bits are very nice, too.

RATING: 2
The deductive puzzle part of the game is clever but other than that this is an exercise in chaos and random screwage. It's one of those games where you can get blown out of the water by your oppoenents but aren't quite sure what you did wrong or what you could have done differently. No fun at all...

Gorgeous production values (especially the stone-like statues) and nice gameplay.
Takes the deduction mechanism from Old Town (reducing possible locations step-by-step) and tones it down a little for better family playability. The process of dividing up a found treasure has strong gambling aspects, although I think especially this part suffers a little when playing with two
Nevertheless, the game is very playable with any player count.

Delightful change of pace with this somewhat abstract, yet also thematic gameplay of treasure hunting. Nice bits for sure, and fun, working the treasure maps to get the scores for the treasure discoveries. Very original, and well done. The two curse cards appear randomly so players are unable to prepare for them. So they can spoil a large treasure find, which means its good to evenly spread your clue cards among the four treasure maps to avoid getting burned by the random appearance of a curse card.

Good explorer game, though the rules are a laugh (aka. not very well written at all - when it comes to "so, how exactly does these amulets work?"). But when you've played it once and surfed the geek for rule facts, it is actually not that uncomprehensive. Very good components

Found this game surprisingly poor -- usually I like brainless games like this... the pieces look fantastic, the board is pretty, but the gameplay seemed completely messed up.  Perhaps we played with a rule wrong, but the incentives for what to do on a turn were all very weak.  The putting-the-cubes-on-the-board thing was also incredibly irritating, taking way too long to do, and accomplishing very little.  No desire to play again.

Pretty cool little game of pin-pointing treasure locations and driving your truck around to "claim" them!  I really enjoyed the process of narrowing down the location of the treasures, and trying to get the final treasure position near my truck location in order to get to it first.  The other cool thing is that everyone that contributed information as to the whereabouts of the treasure gets a cut even if they didn't actually "claim" it with their truck; they just get less control over how good their cut of the treasure is.

At first blush, the game seems fairly chaotic, as anybody can lay map sections for any treasure, resulting in little control over where the treasures end up on the map.  However, the amulets are key to having control over the proceedings.  Since amulet locations are predictable, you can maneuver your truck in order to give yourself the best chance of claiming amulets.  Amulets basically allow you to take multiple turns at a time, which is key to both pinpointing and claiming a treasure.  So, to me, the key to the game really is having amulets on hand.

Overall, just a really cool game that I really look forward playing more.  Plus, it's light enough that I'll be able to play it with the family!  Good stuff!

The card playing aspect to narrow down the locations of the treasures is really cool. I like the treasure distribution mechanic, which encourages having the most clues, but also the later clues, which creates a point of tension.

However, the game feels repetitive (likely because the only time your style of play changes (just slightly) is when the two Curse cards are out of the game) and seems to simply encourage clue spamming.

Which gives the game an overstay your welcome feel to me. Since I'm just doing the same thing turn after turn after turn, it feels long.

I like it! Simple but also very engaging. Turns are short which keeps the game going at a nice pace. The theme, bits, and short ruleset may make this a good game for non-gamers (you may want to omit the amulets in this instance, however.)

The treasure finding system reminds me of Old Town, but I find these games scratch different itches. In Old Town, the satisfaction comes from having one overall puzzle to solve broken into small chunks which makes for a nice sense of progression, and, when done, conquering a large puzzle. In this game, the satisfaction comes from trying to solve as many small, bite-sized puzzles as you can giving it a simplified, lighter feel.

The game has a nice (but not overwhelming) amount of tension and strategy as you try to keep up with the clue cards other players are playing - making sure you're in on each treasure chest and timing your clues so you get as close to first dibs as possible is essential. The press-your-luck element that comes into play during treasure distribution is nice too - just be careful not to pass TOO much!

A unique "reverse deduction" kind of game (though there isn't really any deduction). The various mechanics are pretty cool. I like how you play cards to narrow the treasures down and I like the distribution of the treasure cards (and the curse cards). I like the amulets too and the various abilities they give you when you own them. I don't like, however, that you can be screwed a bit by unlucky card draws and I've seen this happen more than once. Still, it scales well and is very family friendly, so I enjoy it quite a lot for what it is - and what it is a unique, quick, light, "deduction", family game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Visually appealling bits and interesting treasure distribution mechanic. Unfortunately it isn't fun. It becomes repetetive very quickly and the decision to move the jeep or play a card doesn't make much difference to your score. Overall it is rather chaotic and the winner will be decided by the luck of the draw.

Fun game that just involves a little too much randomness for what it is. In other words, light gamers might not like the cogntive process of eliminating treasure locations and mdeium gamers will be offended when their hard work is spoiled on the last turn by too much variability in card draws. Not that I am bitter. If I had to try a fix it might be having 2 extra treasure draws with one discard getting added back to the draw pile.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Lots of fun.  Very "thinking" intensive kind of game, as you have to deduce where hidden things are in an effort to find them.

So, unlike "social experiment" games like Werewolf or Resistance that require deduction based on outside information (which I despise immensely), the kind of "deduction" required in this game is very different, as it is more fixed and finite.

RATING: 5
Intitial rating an 8. First off, this is probably the best looking game in my collection. The components and board are drop-dead gorgeous. I can see why some are calling this a contender for Spiel de Jahres.

After one play, it strikes me as a polite game. There's not a lot of conflict, everyone gets some treasure, everyone can walk away with some mini victories. The strategies are still a little obtuse to me, but I look forward to playing this more. Although the turn supposedly consists of "play a card or move your jeep," in fact the raising of treasures, the use of amulets actually adds some complexity... more than you would expect in a family game.

Update: a two-player game felt a little flat. Not sure if this is designed for two or not. More plays should reveal if the gameplay changes much with the number of players, or if I'm just a bit cold on the game as a whole.

Update: Traded away along with Acquire and Incan Gold for Goa. Man, I guess "mechanics mattter." This was hard to part with, as it was easily the most visually striking game I owned. The game is flat-out gorgeous. But, I could just never get past the fact that collecting treasures were largely inconsequential when everyone shares in the booty. It's too complex for a family game, and yet it lacks enough "meat" or penalizing systems to be a "gamer's game." I love that process-of-elimination mechanic... it's just the rest that bugged me.

Let's hope my friends like Goa instead...

Map making where you "create the truth", establishing where the treasure is. Really nice mechanic.

Simplicity with a layered approach; establish the location, move to location, dig it up and distribute the gold. Contributing to the location gets you a share in the treasure, regardless of who digs it up. Really helps with player interaction.

The mini-game of distributing the treasure also helps mix things up, keeps the pacing fresh.

The amulets seem a little tacked on for the sake of "a little something extra", but the game could do without them. Maybe I wont be saying that after a few more plays.

Nice components over all with a uniquely shaped and modular board.

Treasure hunting (or more accurately, treasure hunting by elimination) is a nice idea, although the scarcity of the cursed treasure makes getting hit by them all the more annoying. Given that someone who put two or three rose compasses in a treasure may find out that all their efforts were in vain if the first card revealed happens to be a curse, this part of the game is rather luck dependent. It'd also be nice if spending your turn to discard and draw a new hand without expending an amulet was an option. Other than that, a solid concept and an enjoyable game.

Beautiful board and components, and a great fun game. Not sure how to describe it - it's not really deduction as players determine the location of the treasure throughout the game, which is a great feature and gives you a little more control while able to steal a march on your opponents as well.

Finally played this. Had my own copy in shrink for 4 months, but never got around to opening it. Given all the talk I've heard about SdJ potential, I was surprised that this felt as thinky as it did. At first it was a little uncomfortably so, but then I realized I can relax a bit, and only worry about the treasures that are somewhat close to being discovered. I'm really not sure I like the curses. Or more accurately, I'm sure that I don't like them. But having only played once, I'm will to try again before deciding to simply ditch them.

I both understand and do not understand the praise this title is getting. I understand its appeal: digging for treasure on an island using partial clues is a widely-appealing subject. The author did a good job representing this aspect, and it's always kinda neat to see how the number of options shrinks to one, subsequently followed by digging up the treasures. 

But in terms of [i]game[/i], especially [i]interesting game[/i] for the spoilt gamer... No. Once you've dug up one treasure you've dug them all up. There is no progression in this game; just a long string of card additions to a number of cubes, ever shrinking the number of options. You don't get better at finding treasure; you don't get worse either. Tobago turns into quintessential family material where the activity of doing something together is as important as the activity itself, let alone that the activity is a battle of minds. I see Tobago more as [i]activity[/i] than as [i]game[/i], and that means my interest in this game is very fleeting. If the treasure hunt was more involved, and had players thinking about various consequences in dealing with the hunt, then the game might have been worthwhile for me. As it stands now, it isn't.

But still: if you are looking for a nice family game you can put in front of people who hardly ever play... Then Tobago is certainly not a bad choice to make.

I love Tobago. We love Tobago.

Excellent mindset to get the kids in: if not here, then here - can't be here because of this, take this one away ... that means it must be there! I found the treasure!!

Theme and production are top notch - great pieces, fun all around.

Me encanta este juego! Dinámico y original! Bonito, con buenos componentes y tablero variable! Completar mapas de tesoros con pistas que se van añadiendo, y luego, a repartirse el botín!
Pero a quién no le gusta buscar tesoros en bonitas islas??!!
Divertido aunque pueden darse finales de partidas un poco sosas.
Recomendable!

I play this mostly on boardgamearena and it's probably lower than I actually would rate it if I had a physical copy. The game does most of the deduction for you and I think that's the aspect of the game that drew me to it the most. I also mostly play it as a two player game and I think it would be a lot more fun with more.

Deduction and treasure hunt a perfect combo. This game
took us by surprise. Has some neat tense moments when revealing the treasure found. This deserves to be in any
serious gamers collection. Racing around Easter Island and trying to figure out where the treasure may
be found. Visually appealling game as well.

Explaining this game takes awhile, because it really is quite different than most games out there.  It's a deduction game, but the pieces of the puzzle are actually being selected by the players, not discovered.  The savvy player also needs to make the best use of the board and the special amulets to make additional movements.

I'm not in love yet, but definitely intrigued by the innovation of this game.  It's like nothing else on my game shelf, and that's a good thing.

Components: Gorgeous board. Great wooden components. Good iconography.

The game needs a cheatsheet to show what a player may do with an amulet. Also the rules are a bit fiddley re: not using an amulet to get another amulet, since usually a player can just use the regular part of their turn to get the amulet, then use the amulet to go to something else (having the effect that the player just removed the amulet from circulation).

Experience: With just two players, it seems too laborious to both provide clues and drive to pick up treasure. With three players, it plays much better; treasures are quickly located, and I find myself pressured to have at least a part in constructing each of the treasure maps.

I like the logic aspect of trying to apply layers of clues that will place treasure nearer to me, but it almost seems more important to be nearer hotspots of amulets after the treasure has been raised.

Tobago has a great set of mechanics, but its flavor is a little bit weak. I very much enjoy the logic puzzle of placing clues to search for treasure, and the amulets add quite a bit of interesting strategy as well. It is a little slow to start, and that is one of my few complaints, but really takes off after the first treasure has been found. The art and figures are also fantastic.

Downsides include the relation of flavor to mechanics. It always seems like we are speculating about the treasure, "I think the treasure is on a mountain" etc, and then it appears where it is 'rumored' to be. I also think the curses are either too much or too little, in that having only two of them can remove a lot of tension late game.

Pretty fun reversal of a deduction style game where you are actually piecing together a map to locate hidden treasures.

Tobago is an adventure game, in which the players possess different parts of treasure maps. During the game, more and more information about the locations of the treasures are revealed, and the possible locations are narrowed down. When a player identifies the location of one of the treasures, they try to reach it as fast as possible to secure the findings.

RATING: 7.5
Definitely a unique game, which is saying something if you have a large collection. Can strain your brain a little bit.

Update: prefer it much more with three than with four, if only to have a better chance at seeding a treasure. It feels like too much takes place and out of your control with four players. I'd love to try it with two if I get the chance.

This may not be a top game but is so good in so many ways.

First there is the "backward deduction" mechanism to find the treasures, that is really cool, then there is the hand menagement combined with the board movement to be at the right place at the right time, then there is the search for the right time to use the amulets and, at last, the press your luck/odds mechanism to share each treasure loot...
The artwork and the theme are great, the components are of good quality and the modular board ensures new play every time. The game suits families, boardgamers and even, sometimes, parties. What more can you ask from a game?

Virtually no strategy or urgency to do anything.  No real advantage to being the first to get to a treasure.  To win, just spread your compasses across all the treasure maps and grab an occasional medallion. I found it a bit boring.  . 

I played this with the kids.  They were more interested in the game pieces.  

I gave it a 6 because placing the tiles did get the kids thinking.  

Overall I liked the concept but it delivered very little.

Fun, family-oriented game that my niece, who does not like to play games, likes. Until both curses have been revealed, the game really doesn't reward planning; you  play pretty much any legal card and hope to get a little luckier than the other players during the draw for treasures. Once the curses are gone --- and if enough time remains --- the amulets' powers become more useful, and some planning may be worthwhile. Even so, the game remains a light romp.

Bon jeu au matériel splendide.
Plusieurs parties sont nécessaires pour bien intégrer les règles qui doivent absolument être complétées par la FAQ officielle Gigamic.
Ce que j'ai fait en créant un ficher PDF des règles intégrant directement la FAQ, tout en conservant la superbe mise en page d'origine ! 
Je tiens mes règles à disposition via message personnel. 

RQ : autant pour le Cluedo 2008 j'ai fait travail de réécriture, autant pour Tobago j'ai juste complété avec les infos officielles pour faire des règles béton ! 
J'espère que vous aurez ainsi autant de plaisir que moi à y jouer. 

NB : au début, il n'est pas évident de bien avoir en tête l'organigramme des actions possibles lors d'un tour de jeu et des combos (genre action supplémentaire puis action de base puis action supplémentaire puis récupérations de plusieurs trésors de suite !). Cela prend plusieurs parties pour bien maîtriser les règles et donc les parties sont plutôt longues au début, même avec une petite carte (plateau de jeu côté "lettres minuscules"). Patience !

Players are treasure hunters driving their 4WD ATV's all over the island of Tobago, searching for treasures.  Simple to play game, where players on their turn either move their vehicle over the hexmap modular board, or play a clue card against a treasure.  There are four treasures to find at any one time, and clues gradually refine the location of these treasures until only one hex remains - the location.  A player who moves their ATV to the location may raise that treasure, and all clue contributors are entitled to a portion.  Nice push your luck rules for sharing the treasure means you may get a low value card, or a curse!  Lovely looking game, plays well and is deceptively deep.  Millions of board setups (32 different boards, and the idol, tree and hut pieces can be set up anywhere) - no game will ever play the same way twice.  Great friends game, or one for families with older children.  Very good.

RATING: 6
Players compete to discover buried treasure using a novel process-of-elimination card system.  Each player who helps to narrow down the location of the treasure gets a share, although I am not enthusiastic about how it gets distributed.  Also, the curse cards, though thematic, somehow seem out of place.  The treasure-hunting mechanism itself is very novel, but it seems like the scoring system was an afterthought and isn't the greatest.  The game includes a couple of variants that I have yet to try.

My first impression so far is that the game is definitely interesting and beautiful, and the mechanics are quite neat and unique.  These are all factors that are important to me in a game, however the actual gameplay is not quite as fun as I would like. It seems to drag at times but this could just be due to slow play as we learn the game. It's still enjoyable though and is definitely unlike any other game in my collection. I'm curious about how it will play now that we are past the learning stage.
Edit: After another play the pace seemed improved, it plays faster when all the players know the game.  Raised my rating a bit.

Pretty good treasure hunting game that does a nice job capturing the feel of a treasure map.  The playing of clue cards to narrow down the treasure locations is a pretty neat concept.   Moving the ATVs around the island isn't quite as interesting, but necessary to get first shot at the treasures.   Raising the treasures has a ton of luck in it, not unlike the digs in Thebes.   This seems like a good family deduction game with a pretty light feel to it.  I agree with the many others who think this could be a good SdJ contender.  Great looking production too, but as a result, the game is pretty expensive for what it is.

There are some very clever ideas here.  The fact that the board can be assembled in so many combinations yet always with one "biggest" of each terrain type is particularly clever, as is the basic mechanic of laying  clue cards.  Gameplay is fun and rewards sound strategy.  If I have one complaint, it's that the game can wear out its welcome.  The treasure distribution phase in particular can drag on after you've done it for the tenth time. I'd rate the gameplay a 7.5, but I bumped it up to an 8 for the fantastic components and art direction. If it were a bit shorter, I might have rated it a 9.  Some house tweaks to victory conditions could improve this issue.

Adventure, family game where 4 ATVs are racing around the tropical island of Tobago to find as much buried treasure as they can. Every player contributes to the maps of 4 different treasure chests by reducing the possible location for it, until the location is reduced to one possible field. And then digging and distribution of treasure commences. There are also mysterious statues that leave magic amulets around and there are curses in the treasure chests. It's fun racing game of chances with smart mechanic of map making.

A game unlike most others, with nice components. Lots of replay value, due to the modular board. The rulebook could stand some improvement, however.

All the moving parts in this game start to drag it down, but man are they beautiful.  I feel the game would work better as a piece of art than a game, but compared to other art it would probably be kind of crappy.  What the heck am I talking about?

Beautiful board, components, cards, everything! While this is a pretty simple family game, there are plenty of choices to make and it's just plain fun! It's great to join in on a large treasure payout, even more fun to bail with your goods and watch the others dig up a skull and crossbones.

Love the theme with childish joy! You are contributing with new clues during the treasure hunt. The treasure location will soon be down to a single space. Every one who contributed will have a share of the treasure - not only the finder.

Of course there is luck involved! It is a treasure hunt! No luck - no excitement...

I love the game's treasure map premise and enjoy the process of homing in on treasure locations. With more players it becomes increasingly more difficult to control the treasure locations, but with too few the drafting of treasure cards loses its tension, leaving something to be desired with each configuration. The graphics could use a face lift, but its mediocrity suits the gameplay.

Pretty game with a really cool theme and deduction element.  But, after about 10 plays it felt samey because there aren't a whole lot of different things to do or to choose from. Also, after a while, placing the cubes all over the board feels fiddly. However it is an excellent entry level game.

The set collection and deduction aspect of this game is fresh and innovative.  Have lots of fun every time I play.  I want to try some of the variants.  Would be interested in one where the luck in drawing treasure cards isn't such a huge part of the end-game scoring.  Coming in 2nd place with 50% more treasure cards than the winner can be really frustrating.

(As of [b]5[/b] plays) A family game with gorgeous components. Manages to downplay direct player confrontation while still maintaining a competitive atmosphere. The mechanics of narrowing down possible treasure locations are very cute, while the amulets provide limited strategic options that help counteract the randomness. 

[b]2 year verdict:[/b] Not getting much play nowadays. I'm tempted to get rid of it, but as my relatives have finally started to take an interest in my games, I think I'll keep it around just in case. And it's still gorgeous.

I think Tobago's mismarketed. It isn't a deduction game as the box states, since any clues played are visible by all of the players. And if that isn't enough, there are cubes placed to ensure that everyone knows exactly where the treasure is eventually going to be. It's a crutch that I'm not sure is necessary, and it takes any deduction out of the game. All you have to figure out is a) which of your cards will narrow down the treasure's location and b) how quickly you can get your vehicle to pick it up. There is a fair amount of tactical play as the game continues, but there isn't much long-term planning. You spend much of your time reacting to other players instead. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it is much different than what you might expect.

Tobago is a good family game, but I don't think there's much replay value -- even with the different islands you can make. The way you assemble them is ingenious, but the gameplay just isn't there to support all of the great components.

I was initially interested in this game because of the name and could not find a copy for months so eventually I learned and played my first few games on Board Game Arena. I think more players make it more exciting. I eventually got a copy in trade and it has only been played by 2 which can certainly be more strategic but it not half as exciting. This game uses a mechanism that we do not have in any of our other games and for that reason alone it is a keeper. You are given a handful of clue cards and you use the clues to pinpoint (or in actuality determine) where the island treasures are located. Treasure hunting is kind of an instabuy for me but also I like the exploration/deduction aspect that accompanies it. Technically you can just sit in one spot or move to convenient spots and not do very much the entire game, but I avoid players who work the angle of a game or try to break the game. That sort of play style makes games boring for me. I believe games should be played in the spirit meant which is 'exploration and treasure hunting'. Does not hurt that I got married in Tobago and am planning to move to Tobago in a few years :) Will definitely have a place on my shelf there. The artwork and components are stunning, and this game has the BEST INSERT EVER!!!

This game definitely has some fantastic components - wooden palm trees, huts, SUVs and treasure cubes, and resin stone statues, which add much to the mood of your treasure hunt.

A nice, relaxing game that is mildly competitive due to the randomness in scoring. In my last game, I saw that two 6 treasures were coming up and I had the first two choices (score!) only to pull a hex card and be screwed out of any treasure at all. WTF? I really don’t care that this is not true deduction, it’s fun to play the clue cards and “direct” the treasure your way and away from your opponents. Oh, by the way, I won that game despite being screwed out of those two 6 treasures by using amulets to claim the last three treasures. Ha!

I like the mechanics and the theme of treasure hunt, but overally I feel that most of the strategy is really bruised up by the random treasure cards. Also often, and expecially at start, if you make a treasure visible, it will be taken by enemy player, favoring them more, and if you take it, they often get to take amulets. Probably this is a balancing factor, but I don't like how it feels. Overally the game is enjoiable anyway.

Really quick and a lot simpler than I expected. I may even be able to play this with my daughter (8).

Actually I am a little disappointed with how simple this is. I was expecting it to take 4-5 clues to narrow down a treasure sufficiently however usually a pair of clues is sufficient although I do believe set up has more of an influence upon this than first suspected.

The amulets are too easy to come by therefore you can effectively monopolise a treasure by ensuring you discover it all before on opponent gets to play any cards.

The two curse cards are really insignificant. Although they are devastating if and when they come up once the two are gone you can play risk free. 

I think the player claiming the final treasure card getting to place the next clue and get a compass rose upon it is very very powerful and I think we shall house rule that the top card of the deck is turned instead.

Traded in a math trade (2014) for Gem Dealer.

Played with only 2, for which I would already give 7 out of 10. But this game just has to be even better with more players. Therefor I'm giving it 8/10. You just have to love the modular board and the lovely bits and pieces. While the gameplay certainly is interesting as well, though perhaps sometimes a player might think too much through all his options from cards, car movement and/or amulets.

EDIT :
After first play with 4, its score has risen to a solid 9 for me. One of my favourite games, certainly from the ones played in 2011.

This is a game that I knew I had to have after reading the rules. The artwork is gorgeous, the gameplay is innovative, and it looked like a lot of fun. Overall, I think it succeeds. Tobago IS a lot of fun. My only problem with the game is that I feel like there are too many "not" cards in the mix. You know, the ones with things crossed out. It makes it too hard sometimes to make a meaningful play. I realize that without those it would be too easy to narrow things down too quickly, but I feel like the perfect balance was missed. Overall though, a great game.

It's been called a deduction game, but it's more about making the deduction puzzle than solving it, so it doesn't require nearly as much brain matter as I first thought it might.  This is an extremely well produced game that plays in under an hour and is great for families and adults that want something lighter.  Luck plays a significant role in what clue cards come up, and especially which treasure cards appear.  Treasure is distributed Saboteur-style, but with the added element of 2 possible curse cards, which add a bit of tension and opportunity for bluffing.

Only one play; enough to tell me I would willingly play but won't be buying this.  What makes me willing to play is the start-to-finish involvement of all players; something I can pretty much get from most continental games.

Some neat mechanisms here, marred by the chaos induced by treasure draws.  It won't matter how well you play; you could win or lose based solely on the card draw.  A little less reliance on the card draws would make this game great; perhaps more reward for actually being first to the treasure?

In short, it's a poor ending, but a fun journey.

Könnyedd, jópofa, jó kis gateway vagy családi.

Jópár online játék után sikerült letisztázni a helyes szabályokat is. Sajnos a szabálykönyv nagyon rosszul sikerült, mind az angol, mind a magyar. Maga a játék pofon egyszerű mechanizmusra épül, de van egy két körülményesnek tűnő dolog a szabályban, amit ráadásul nem is sikerült értelmesen leírni, így mindenképpen ajánlott egy játék a BGA-n, hogy letisztuljon a dolog.

Jól működik két fővel. A szerencsének azért van szerepe, de bőven van agyalni való benne. Jó kis időtöltés, és szemet gyönyörködtető látvány. Élőben kicsit nehézkes a kincspozíciók regisztrálása, szerintem mindig csúszik bele valami hiba. :)

Tobago may be very close to the quintessential family game. It's got an exciting theme (treasure hunt!), gorgeous components, light strategy and a good dose of plain old luck. So much so, in fact, that I doubt the best player will win this with anything approaching consistency.

The way players zero in on the treasure locations by playing clue cards is pretty clever and is both the heart and the soul of the game, but it also has a few elements that seem to be there purely for thematic reasons as they don't really add anything to the gameplay (especially the truck movement).

"Tobago" a été une vraie claque ludique. La première partie m'a bluffé, tant j'avais l'impression d'avoir joué à quelque chose d'unique. Et puis immédiatement, le plaisir ludique était très présent, durant toute la partie. J'avais l'impression de retourner en enfance au cours de l'une des chasses au trésor organisé par mes parents pour mes anniversaires (effet madeleine de Proust).

Ce qui fait tout le sel du jeu, c'est vraiment ce mécanisme original de recherche du trésor et de la restriction des possibilités. Chacun cherche à se placer un peu partout au mieux, tout en essayant, si possible, de prendre ce trésor si convoité pour avoir la possibilité de choisir en premier. Le mécanisme de recherche de trésor est presque coopératif, et particulièrement bien pensé, même si parfois un peu brise-neurones (est-ce que ça fait avancer les choses, comment je peux restreindre les recherches ?). A travers ce mécanisme se met en place toute la subtilité du jeu : se placer un peu partout, essayer d'avoir le plus de roses des vents, réussir à attraper le trésor et donc dévoiler le trésor au moment opportun, être placé le "plus bas" pour pouvoir choisir avant les autres et éviter les malédictions...

La répartition des trésors est également bien pensée, bien que moins originale et dont le risque est toutefois assez faible, le jeu ne comportant que deux malédictions qui, finalement, ne renversent tout de même pas le jeu (on craint beaucoup plus les "Epidémies" de "Pandémie", par exemple), même s'il est assez jouissif de réussir à éviter une malédiction tout en profitant de la répartition d'un trésor. Toutefois, la part de hasard (on ne connaît pas toutes les cartes, sauf exception) compensée par des probabilités et le mécanisme reposant sur l'équilibre risque/prudence fonctionne bien et met un peu de piquant lors de cette phase.

Les amulettes, elles, se révèlent également indispensables. Pour éviter les malédictions, certes, mais aussi pour pleinement saisir une opportunité à un moment donné, permettant une liberté d'action bien plus grande, ce qui s'avère nécessaire au fil du jeu, on ne peut plus se contenter des deux actions de départ.

Mais malgré toute cette richesse qui rend le jeu intéressant pour les joueurs réguliers, le jeu est tout à fait abordable pour des joueurs novices. Le thème est bien présent (sauf pour les voitures qui vont sur l'eau), immersif (on se sent à la recherche du trésor, nous promenant sur l'île, à travers les différents paysages... ça facilite l'entrée dans le jeu. De plus, les mécanismes, bien que non dénués de subtilité, sont simples et fluides, rapides à mettre en place (partie rapide), non sans écarter une certaine réflexion.

Ajoutez à cela un matériel de qualité, un visuel attractif, un mécanisme de répartition des amulettes par les statues très ludique (même si les prmeières parties sont un peu désorganisées : "Mais tu l'as déjà bougé elle, non, vu que y'a l'amulette ici..."). Bref, pour moi, "Tobago" est l'une des plus belles sorties ludiques de ces dernières années, qui brille tant par son originalité mécanique que par un thème immersif. Une très bonne porte d'entrée dans le monde ludique moderne, et néanmoins un plaisir intact et renouvelé pour des joueurs plus expérimentés. Une chasse au trésor que l'on n'oublie pas, ça non.

Clever and interesting game.  The art work is beautiful and components are outstanding.  You take turns "defining" the location of treasure through the playing of map cards.  You all race to the treasure once it is located.  There are special ability chits that arrive on the board when a treasure is found.  If anything, the game feels a bit too short.  The rules are light and it will likely see play time because of it.

Good light family game. Plays pretty quick, reasonably easy to learn. Of the two main mechanics, one (treasure location) is satisfying enough in a non taxing kind of way (a bit like filling in a very unchallenging crossword or logical puzzle), and the other adds the element of tension that would otherwise be lacking (treasure repartition). Great components. Overall I'm very glad to have it because I'll be able to get the family to play regularly and it'll be enjoyable. Would be picky to ask for more.

Bought the game due to it's awesome components, however I had certain gripes about the game where the components could not make up for it.

1) Confusion over certain actions such as:
Picking up amulets - at the start of your turn and you are on a space occupying an amulet/completing a movement leg.
For new players, they get the impression that you have to move your ATV to get an amulet where you can actually pick an amulet up if your ATV started the turn on top of an amulet and then u can play a clue card.

2) The requirement for extreme spatial visualization in some cases:
When you have a clue card which states within a terrain feature, it makes it much easier to narrow down treasures, however when you start playing clues such as not within a terrain, not next to a statue, not within sight of a hut, not next to a tree... trying to find out which hexes could contain the treasure takes quite awhile (at least for those I play with).

3) The judging of number of hexes away... I ended up just visualizing two circles from the landmark in order to estimate those clue cards containing "within sight of"

Personal gripes... so may or may not happen when you play it.

Tobago is a beautiful looking game and one that doesn't play like anything I know. The 'forced deduction' mechanic is unique and works for what it is. It runs a bit dry at times, but for the length and easy complexity it doesn't cause too much of an issue. That being said, I think I've played this enough times to realize its shortcomings.  Most of the time on a turn a player's move is either blindly apparent or somewhat arbitrary. As such, little decision making is present. The game comes off as a blunt, tactical procedure, and what little fun that comes out of it is robbed by the random nature of the cards and the Treasure system. It's a shame, as the 'forced deduction' is certainly interesting. I only wish there was a better game here.

I've played a couple games of this and really liked it. It's a game of deduction where players attempt to figure out where the treasures are located on the island. Then it's a race to grab them. The really neat part is the way the stone statues rotate and cause treasures to roll up on the beach. I also like the modular board design so you can have a lot of different island maps to play on.

Fun deduction game that's very thematic: treasure hunters compete to dig up buried treasure on a mysterious island.

I've printed helpful hints info on & what his options are, I even tried letting him win...alas he only is willing to play occasionally.

A beautiful application of logical argument in eliminating possible treasure locations...neat! A game that is truly about the process rather than the outcome. A lot of random elements makes this a game with a good deal of luck, but the play of the game is so entertaining that winning or losing hardly matters. 

The game has become after several plays more strategic and less tactical.  That means that becoming more selective about the treasure location manipulations has become a greater part of the decision process rather than merely finding the first treasure that a particular clue can serve the purpose of possibility reduction.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is beautiful. The components are very well made and look great. It is a sort of semi deduction game where all players are playing their hint cards to add clues to each treasure map. Then once narrowed down to one space. Everyone races their jeeps to try and be the first one to dig up the treasure. Digging it up gives you a bonus when the treasure is divided amongst the players. It has a good feel to it and is fun to play.

Although you have to be careful when playing clues. So as not to mess up or it can kind of ruin the game if played incorrectly.

The game has some really nice mechanics incorporated into it that give the game a good feel. This would be a good game for families and some children. It's not a heavy game, but is fun to play, so I would also recommend it to the average gamer as well.

It's something between deduction game (although it's not), pick-up-and-deliver, tile-laying and who-knows-what-more. One of the most original games (if not THE most original) I have ever played. It also has one of the best written rules in gaming history. You can play it with your aunt and you can play with your gamer friend - both ways are enjoyable. And thanks to modular board and random setup of statues it's very replayable.

I recommend Tobago a lot. Maybe you'll not like it but for sure you'll remember it.

RATING: 6.8
A game that can be played by non-gamers and gamers together. The slight downside is that the non-gamers might not spot the usefulness of the amulets for the first couple of games as ways of sneaking in to grab treasure from under other players' noses.

Because of the way that the location of treasure is narrowed down, any downtime between turns is effectively masked as the players collectively work out how the latest card affects the board. That makes for a good social game.

The quality of the components like resin Easter Island heads or wooden jeeps with painted headlights is stunning. The insert is marvelous and every pieces has a safe stashing place. Oh wait!

Adventure = Must Buy

I'm such a sucker for adventure and nice bits and this one delivers on both fronts. First of all, it's looks amazing.

Secondly, it's actually a very deep game, with hard decisions all the time. There's lots of strategy in this game, and the luck is mitigated very very well.

I have to commend the designer on this one; a very good, complex and deep euro with such simple and easy to grasp mechanics which offers something other games in this genre don't; awesome theme. The theme doesn't feel tacked on, which is rare for a euro. It feels as though that Tobago is a euro that was designed for ameritrash fans like myself, and to suck me into deeper thinking man's euro games. It's light, but has some really good think-ey parts to it to keep the heavy gamers occupied, and is easy enough for lighter gamers too. It hits a nice balance of everything, and is just lots and lots of fun.

Some games with lots of thinking, and deep gameplay don't really grab me that often, not to mention so very few euros that are able to do this over the ameritrash luck-fests I'm a huge fan of.

Tobago is an amazing game that I'd recommend for anyone. It might be a bit much for family gaming, but it's tough to say, since the theme and bits are so appealing. I feel it might be the number of options available that might confuse and confound the non-gamer's out there, but I could be wrong, and haven't tested the waters with non-gamers just yet.

Tobago is an excellent choice for those families that are ready to move on from Ticket to Ride, Carcasonne and Settlers, and are looking for something a bit deeper, and more complex. The look and feel of this game will grab nearly anyone's attention, and once they play it, they'll want to keep bringing it out.

The Lady and I played it three times the first time we opened the box, and Galaxy trucker is the only other game that has done this...ever.

One of the very few euros we enjoy, and of course, a lot of the folk on BGG deem this to be mediocre at best. If you want a euro that isn't dry, bland or boring, then get Tobago.

Despite a rulebook I would rank somewhere between "bad" and "awful," I thought the game was pretty fun.  Really like the treasure hunt and narrowing down locations and the bits are really nice.  There is a pretty high luck factor in this game, though, as some of the clue cards seemed just better than others and the curses can be pretty harsh.  Additionally, I learned fast that initial placement of your ATV is huge, as getting to any amulets for me proved tough due to my placement.  .

Long-term strategies are difficult to implement because of the randomness, but the tactics of those random opportunities are interesting. As random as the game is, I'm inclined to prefer that the game were a little shorter, but it's easy to tweak the game length.

The only real mechanical complaint is that putting the statues only one away from the coast tends to cause the amulets to clump together unfairly, but the requirement to keep them four apart almost requires them to be close to the coast.

RATING: 7
Tobago is a fun, friendly, attractive family-weight game that has the feel of a potential Spiel des Jahres winner - but it wasn't even nominated.  Players play cards that gradually winnow possible locations for a number of different buried treasures.  Every time a player plays one of these cards, they're contributing to the search for that treasure, and will be rewarded with one of the treasure cards that will be drawn when it is found.  The player who drives to the location and physically finds the treasure will also get a card - likely the best one.  The game generates a satisfying cooperative feeling.  Players are not on the same team, but whenever a card is played they will work together to deduce the possible locations of a treasure and mark them with cubes on the board.  This "thinking together" gives the game a friendly feeling that I think most players will enjoy, and creates a lot of pleasant social interaction.

Be warned: this is a very random game in ways that will frustrate players who are concerned with fairness and equitable game balance.  It's very possible to end up with a hand of cards that prevents you from doing anything useful.  Treasures might pop up within the reach of your truck, or they might all be found on the other end of the board.  There is heaps and heaps of randomness to the treasure card collection, especially surrounding the two curse cards - which can really screw you even if you have the protection of an amulet. Honestly, this is the sort of game that is most enjoyable if players don't put too much thought into optimizing every play they make.

Those who have played Old Town will recognize some very similar concepts in Tobago.  Although it's not as puzzly-thinky or difficult as Old Town, I think Tobago fits together better and is much more enjoyable.  Even for someone like me who tends to go for the puzzly-thinky choice in most cases.

The first that strikes is the beautiful artwork and production qualities, but underneath there is a quite nice game too. It is a family strategy type of game so the amount of strategy is limited. That doesn’t say that there isn’t any, just that there is usually either some obvious moves or there are quite an amount of luck involved and that it is quite tactical. I think that is fine as it is a lighthearted game. Played with both three and four players and it seemed fine at both numbers.

Tobago is an excellent game.  There is a lot of player interaction yet it never feels tense because of it.  EXCEPT when it comes to taking treasure cards, "I hope they take that four so I get my six."

It is fiddly though, and some rules are easy to over look.  I have played at least 10 games of this and I still forget to put out the amulets.  

I also feel that it would benefit from more curse cards or, even better, an unknown quantity of them.  These add a lot of (good) tension and the game gets a little stale when player's know there will be no more curses because we've seen two.

Excellent artwork and production values.  Treasure map making mechanic is almost like bidding and is quite clever and unique.  Advanced amulet powers make a good game better.  

Game has (to me) somewhat of a beginning, mid, and end game feel due to the presence of two curse cards in the treasure deck; you know that the first 12 treasure cards cannot have a curse in there.  After the 12th treasure is issued, we play treasure maps much more cautiously due to the possibility of getting a curse (mitigated by having an amulet); however, after the two curse cards are gone, we try to make the treasure maps as long as possible, which means more treasure for you when it's found.

My last session of Tobago seemed to draaag, and somewhat soured my view of this game.  I have a soft spot for this game but I traded it for LOTR: Confrontation, which was an excellent trade because my wife enjoys LOTR much more than Tobago.

A fun little deduction game where the players don't actually deduce anything themselves, it's all done by the use of cards which specify information about the location of the treasure. I'd like to play again. Fairly light - a good family game.

First play was very fun, though more plays with different numbers of players will help me really decide how good this game is.  Considering eliminating the Curse cards altogether.

I think the Curse cards are necessary to keep things interesting.  Still not sure what level of potency works best yet though.

Not my game.  At first the mechanics seem to be appealing but in the long run, it all boils down to which treasure cards you draw when a new treasure is unearthed.  So I feel there's a gap between the actions possible in the game and the way the winner is actually decided.

RATING: 6
It looks beautiful, with very nice pieces, especially the Moai-like statues. I enjoy the card play to pinpoint the location of treasures via clues, which constitutes the clever core of the game. Unfortunately, it is spoiled by the randomness in the distribution of the payout, particularly with the cursed treasures, not to mention the played clue cards that the players simply lose at the end of the game. I'm uncertain that it even works as a family game, as non-gamers often struggle with the clue cards.

I have no idea how one does well in this game--much seems to depend on whether you can snatch early amulets and draw good treasures. That said, it's a gorgeous production; and though playing cards to eliminate possible locations doesn't allow for much in the way of control, it is fun and somewhat innovative.

RATING: 6
It looks amazing, it sounds very cool and intriguing and it plays... well, fine.

The ideas are really great and the game works, but it didn't catch me. I would play it again, but I wouldn't buy it.

Putting cards into play seems to be the way to go, as this will net you points, while driving around does not, or atleast it's risky in the case you're planing ahead, since other players can ruin your plan easily.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I give it a 7 as a lighter, family, "gateway" game OR for gamers that thrill over the excellent and evocative buried treasure theme. For more experienced or hardcore gamers, I'd give it a 6 based on gameplay. 

Much of it is mitigated random, and the two curse cards in the treasure deck don't do enough to sway gameflow. Getting rid of them outright (which is suggested to tweak the game in the rulebook) might be a variant to employ before your first game.  Amulets have more than one power, so even getting rid of the curse cards, players would probably not alter their strategy too much.

My copy is opened, complete, and has been played twice.

This is a pretty fun change of pace game with some fun mechanics.  The game design is very nice and the interchangeable board gives it pretty good re-playability.  The only hassle with this one is constantly removing/adding blocks to identify where the treasure is.  Also the extra turn pieces can get a bit annoying. This is a good one for the family.

I've played this game once so far after only half-listening to the rules, but I got the gist of it.  It might be worth playing again, but it's not a great game overall.

I find it a bit chaotic, because you might have a great plan for a future use of a particular card, but someone else might play another card on a treasure map that makes that card useless.  There is a lot of luck-of-the-draw for cards, which isn't necessarily a deal breaker -- I'd have to play more to decide.

The amulets and curses are good fun, and throw some extra strategic considerations into the mix.

This is a game that would be much more fun with computer assistance, to help everybody answer the question "what would happen if I played this card on this treasure map".  There are 16 such calculations to be made by each player on each turn (4 cards x 4 treasures).  People can often make mistakes even when all players are watching the board, so I'd say that that's the clunkiest part of the game.

Interesting rules question that came up: if there happen to be 2 treasures (single cubes) in the same hex, can a single ATV pick it up with one action?  We played that you could only get one treasure per ATV move.

Fun game for families, with some strategy and a good portion of luck. It is basically a deduction game.

The quality of game material is fantastic, from the thick modular board to the game pieces. 

Given the type of game and the target group, strategic depth is limited, preventing me for giving a score higher than 7.5, but I can easily understand why families and casual gamers would rate it higher.

Interesting game with treasure/points collection based on a series of logical strictures, added by the players. There is some 'race to the treasure' aspect, as the 1st there gets 1st pick, but all who contributed to the rules get slices, except when there's a curse.

There is as much 'race to the amulet' pressure, as these both protect from curses, and allow extra actions.

It makes a nice light game, with a lot of social interaction as the treasure locations are constrained, but it's not terribly deep. The bits are boffo- some of the best components I've ever seen- but the game play isn't too challenging.

I'll throw out a 6.5 on a 1st solo 4-player game, nice, and nice to look at, but not going to be a special favorite of mine I expect.

As everyone has noticed the bits look great and the board folding is a nifty idea to increase replayability. But the actual gameplay underwhelmed.

Jó játék, én szeretem és többször játszottam játékmesterként rendezvényeken és azoknak akiknek megmutattam szintén tetszett.  Ha az ember megérti a kincskeresés és a nyomkártyák lerakásának mechanizmusát, egy könnyed szórakoztató játék. 


A játékban 2-4 játékos kincsekre vadászik egy szigeten. A sziget három lapból állítható össze. A lapok mindkét oldalán térképrészlet van (ABC és abc) jelölésekkel. Ha kiszámoljuk ez összesen 16 variációt tesz lehetővé és miután a táblák összeillesztésének kétfajta lehetősége van – attól függően, hogy feljebb vagy lejjebb toljuk őket – így a térkép összesen 32 módon rakható össze. Emellett az újrajátszhatóságot biztosítja az is, hogy a térképen lévő hatszögekre véletlenszerűen helyezzük fel a három pálmafát, a négy házikót és három kőszobrot (amik a  Húsvét-szigetekien lévő moai szobrokra emlékeztetnek). 
A játék egyik érdekes mechanizmusa ahogy a kincsekre vadászunk. Ugyanis a kincseknek nincsenek meghatározott helyei, hanem mi maguk határozzuk meg a négyfajta (szürke, fehér, fekete, barna) kincs helyét. A szigeten található tengerpartok, bozótosok, tavak, folyók, helyek és dzsungelek. Illetve ezeken található az általunk tetszőlegesen felrakott pálmafák, kőszobrok és házikók. Hatfajta nyomkártya segítségével határozzuk meg a kincsek helyét. Ezek  meghatározzák, 
-	hogy a kincs valamely területen található (pld. tengerparton, legnagyobb dzsungelben stb.) 
-	vagy éppen nem ott található (pld. nincs tavon, folyón stb.)
-	vagy a kincs valami közvetlen közelében van (pld. folyó mellett, szobor mellett)
-	vagy egy vagy két távolságra tőle (pld. tengerparttól egy vagy kettő távolságra, pálmafától egy vagy két távolságra)
-	vagy nem a terepfajta mellett van (pld. nincs közvetlenül dzsungel mellett)
-	vagy pedig látótávolságon kívül van (pld. a kunyhótól több mint két távolságra van)
Minden nyomkártya csökkenti a lehetséges helyek számát és nem lehet ellentétes a korábbi nyomokkal. Minden nyomkártyát az adott kincs alá rakjuk és rátesszük a jelölőnket, jelezve, hogy ezt az információt mi adtuk a kincshez. Így szép sorban csökkentjük a lehetséges helyek számát, sorba vesszük le a térképről a jelölőket, míg már csak egyetlen jelölő marad. Ezután a szigeten lévő autónkkal el lehet kocsikázni odáig és aki felteszi a kincset szintén egy jelölőt rakhat a kincs alá. 
A játék másik érdekes mechanizmusa a kincskártyák szétosztása. A kincskártyákon 2-től 6-ig aranyérmék (gyakorlatban győzelmi pontok) találhatók, illetve két átokkártya is van. Annyi kincset veszünk a pakliból, mint amennyi jelölő a kincs alatt van, ebből mindenki annyit kap a kezébe, amennyi jelölőt az adott kincshez letett. Mindenki megnézi majd ezeket összekeverjük (hozzákeverve egy plusz kártyát is). Majd sorba csapjuk fel a kincskártyákat és alulról felfelé haladva sorba eldöntik a játékosok, hogy kérik-e a kincset (tehát aki  megtalálta a kincset választ először) vagy pedig vár egy jobb kincskártyára. Aki elviszi a kártyát, elveszi a jelölőjét és jön a következő kártya. Ha átokkártyát húzunk fel, akkor megszakad a kincs osztás és akinek van még jelölője a kincs alatt annak vissza kell adni a legértékesebb kincsét, hacsak nem tud amulettet beadni helyette. 

A kincskeresés és a kincs szétosztása a játék lényege, bár a leírások szerint az igazi taktikát az amulettek jelentik a játékban. Ugyanis a kincsek kiosztása után a kőszobrok 60 fokot elfordulnak és ahová a tengerpartra néznek a víz egy amulettet sodor a partra. Ezeket pedig az autóval való mozgás közben veheti fel az ember. Az amuletteket többféle módon felhasználhatjuk:
-	védelem az átokkártya ellen
-	extra akcióként két nyomkártyát rakhatunk le, vagy még egyszer mozgathatjuk autónkat
-	vagy le lehet venni egy kincsjelölőt a térképről ezzel csökkentve a lehetséges kincslelőhelyek számát
-	kezünkben lévő nyomkártyákat kicserélhetjük és rögtön használhatjuk az új kártyákat.
A kártyacsere egyébként amulett nélkül is lehetséges csak akkor mást nem csinálhatunk. Ezt a szabályt érdekes módon csak az amuletteknél írják le, ez mindenképpen a szabálykönyv hibája. 

Mindent egybe véve egy remek családi játék, amely szerintem már két fővel is jól működik, bár 3-4 fővel még jobb. Gyönyörű kivitel és jól működő mechanizmusok jellemzik. Kezdőknek is bátran ajánlható. A Piatniknak köszönhetően sok helyen kapható, ráadásul nem megfizethetetlen áron

The board looks nothing like Tobago.  At first glance this looks like a deduction game but actually it is a game of majorities.  The number of shares of the treasure you get is determined by the number of clue cards you play.  A card can only be played if it restricts the number of possible locations, while leaving at least one valid location.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A family deduction game with bags of visual appeal. Some of the mechanisms seem quite counter-intuitive to what I'd expect given the treasure hunting theme. You play clue cards to localise a treasure that may be nowhere near your jeep, while finding the treasure itself offers no more privilege than first refusal on the spoils. Some deductive interest, but the curse cards and general push-your-luck element in the treasure distribution throw a lot of randomness into the scoring.

This is a great idea.  Unusual gameplay and a very pretty board with fantastic components.  There are definitely downtime issues while players attempt to determine first, what cards are legal to play, and then which ones are advantageous--and cards are much more important than moving around.  

This sort of thinking is something I don't do too easily, but it's a good idea to have a game about it. (2 plays)

The game promises a lot. Board and components are of high quality and the exploration theme seems intuitive. However, I have found the game to be too random. Sadly, the way the points are calculated is the worst parts of the game and decides the winner. Deductive element is nice though, but can be prone to analysis paralysis for some.

I have a feeling this game could have delivered much more but fails to do it due to some designer decisions.

Yes, this game is a one-trick pony, and more of a tactical game than a strategy game, but I still enjoy the heck out of it.  There is something to be said for games that focus on executing a single idea with flair, which this game does.  The clue-playing mechanic is just a lot of fun, and combined with the high quality board and components it's easy to imagine bouncing around the island in an SUV hunting for treasure.  Maybe too simple for some, but I'm always happy to bring this to the table for a light hour of gaming.

Tobago is a fun game, strong in theme, and first rate production value.  The game board is beautifully illustrated with vivid colors depicting a tropical island.  The game also includes small jeeps and palm trees and huts that are seldom, if ever, surpassed in quality.  Players play clue cards to rule out possible locations of four different buried treasures that they are competing to find.  The game board is made of 3 parts that are printed on both sides and can be interlocked in different ways, enabling the game board to be configured several different ways.  I am a huge fan of game boards that cane be reconfigured because each game feels like a different experience.  Overall, I enjoy this game.  It is not a deep game, so I wouldn't want to play it over and over again.

Feb10:

Part of the game is awesome. Then they decided "Let's take this logical family game, and put in the quirkiest, most awkward treasure distribution ever!"

The system overly rewards the person who contributed the most to a treasure. Instead of just getting a larger share of the treasure, they get a larger share of the BETTER treasure in most cases. Not only that, but the actual decisions during the treasure distribution aren't even that interesting.

If I play again? I'm just saying deal out 1 treasure per token; none of the rest of that crap. Leave the Curses out. It would cut the game time significantly and get down to the meat that was interesting.

It could win the Sdj, and it is pretty and entertaining, but it isn't a Keltis that's for sure.

The goal of the game is to explore a island to find out treasures by logical tracking methods. The idea of this game is not bad. Though, the idea is not really working in playing game.

A very strong game in which you are attempting to locate treasure on an island map by slowly whittling down the possible locations for it, before racing to collect it and secure the booty.

I absolutely love the mechanics in this game, each card you play must reduce the possible locations of a piece of treasure and every time you contribute you effectively get an extra share of that treasure once it's found.  You also have to manage the location of your piece on the map, and attempt to periodically collect other artifacts to help your expedition.  This creates a nice balance between the cards and the movement on the board throughout the game.  So-called "curse" cards ensure that only players who balance these aspects properly are likely to receive good treasure and ultimately win the game.

In my opinion, a great game for families and strategy gamers alike.

I love the theme of treasure hunting. This is just so gorgeous to look at with the board artwork plus the components with those wonderful Tiki heads. Played with 2, 3, and 4 players and everyone enjoys it. Interesting 'reverse deduction' to find the treasure makes it a bit different to other games.

Pretty good game, but I wonder if it's been overdone. Could the truck-movement and the amulets be eliminated without hurting much of what's fun in this game (the placement of clues, stock-holding of treasure troves, and the push-your-luck in treasure claims)?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a fun enough game while I'm playing, but I don't get the itch to play it very often. Setup time is slightly longer than I'd like, and after it's over I'm ready for something else, which isn't great for a medium-length game. That might just be a problem with medium-length games, though. Still, given a choice between playing Tobago and Carcassonne, I think I'd choose the latter more often.

Need a couple rule clarifications, but the game is light and harmless enough.  Funner than other deduction games like Clue.

Make sure during setup, at least for 1st game, to not have any of those 3 big idol statues in the same line (amulets will end up stacking on same hex).

It is a clever deduction game. Both the theme and the engine are appealing. Seems like it will never get old.

RATING: 6
Oooh, pretty. :) Quite fun too.

Update: I've tentatively played it with my 7-year old daughter. Despite theme and components, it wasn't a success. She simply became bored long before the game was over. The whole central "the location has to fulfill the criteria on ALL the cards" mechanism was conceptually difficult for her.

Another update: I have now also played with adults who struggled with the mechanism. I think that Tobago falls between two chairs, so to speak: It's too complex and detailed to really work as a family game and too light-weight and random to work as a gamers' game. That's an unfortunate niche to end up in. Too bad...

Playing cards to narrow down the locations of treasures is a fantastic idea, but there are so many other things getting in the way that I felt like the game was too convoluted for the reverse deduction mechanic to reach its full potential. It's too bad that mechanic hasn't been used elsewhere, that I know of.

Would definitely play again if asked, but I sold my copy on eBay. On the upside, it held its value pretty well.

These days my desire to play Tobago is almost zero. I recognize it has great components and it is a fun game for two or there plays, after that I feel it is very samey. Also the game is way too light for my current tastes. I’m rating it at a 5.0 but I suspect it will go lower with more plays.

The whole package earns a 4 because I don't ever see myself playing again, however, the mechanic used to determine where the treasure is located is really clever.  I borrowed the game and sat down with my kids to teach them the logic behind playing the treasure location cards and they got a big kick out of removing the cubes or moving their jeep closer to the treasure.  Unfortunately, I don't care for it enough to sit down and play the entire game multiple times.

I was expecting more. I like the freshness of all the mechanics. I like that children can play with adults. And of course the pieces are pretty.  But the game itself didn't offer me enough challenge. Also the mechanic doesn't work metaphorically for me: you're not "giving clues" to deduce where the treasure is, rather you're shaping where the treasure is by playing clues--the exact opposite. Very expensive too.

The rule book for this game is one of the best I have come across. So easy to follow and refer to. Also this game has some of the best game pieces I have come across. This is the only game I have played with my wife that she immediately asked to play it again. This is a fun fun game full of reverse deduction and we love the way the treasure is distributed even if it was a bit confusing at first. The game plays in under an hour and set up and take down is relatively quick. This is definitely one of the most well thought out and intelligent games I've played and we just love the way the board fits together. The game board is totally different every time. I should add the first time we learnt the game it only took an hour to learn and play through it. This is already a favourite and will see plenty of table time !!
Only played two player so far, can't wait to play four player in the next few days.

Really good treasure hunting game with a pretty neat mechanic. We've only played it once, so I'm hoping we'll get faster about it, but right now we're a little prone to AP. Beautiful components, and really great system of clues.

Update: I still quite like this game, but it has fallen a little flat every time we've played it. The mechanisms are really clever and interesting, but for some reason the fun factor seems lacking. I'm guessing that we have a good group to play this with, but we haven't found it yet.

RATING: 7
Players play cards that narrow the possible location of 1 of 4 treasures. The object is to narrow the location of treasures until there is only one possibility. Players who contributed to defining the location of a treasure take part in its bounty. When the treasure deck runs out, the game is over.

This is an attractive family game but with no real game arc and only a mild level of control. The treasure deck could be 40, 60 or 80 cards and the only thing that would change is game length - the game has no real beginning, middle or end. It seems best to spread your influence to all treasures and take good advantage of the amulets, which give strong advantages if you can get them. It's different and novel enough from other family games that it's a keeper for me.

RATING: 7
I've only played once and I really like Tobago, but both myself and the person I played with found it a bit frustrating because one has to learn all the symbols and what this could mean (in sight of X, next to X, largest X, Not in largest X). When you get a treasure map going, the various symbols can get a bit confusing, so we had to keep referring to the rules which slowed play down. Too, analysis paralysis set in a few times. Still, I think Tobago is a beautifully designed game, and I'd like to see how it plays with more players, so my rating might still go up.

A very elegantly designed game fit for the family. The quality of everything is outstanding. When playing, must remember to add the amulets after each treasure! 

IMPORTANT: There is a 'missing' option C) in addition to A) Playing a clue card and B) Moving your ATV. Namely, you may discard your entire hand and draw a new set of map cards. This rule is only mentioned in the Amulet section at the very end.

There are some deduction elements, but I felt the game was more about anticipation, planning and some good old fashioned cost-benefit analysis. This is more of an abstract bidding/auction game.

RATING: 7
Despite an irresistible theme and fresh mechanics, I have to raise an eyebrow at Tobago. Ostensibly you're hunting for treasure on island with rivers, plains mountains, beaches, forests, and ancient statue gods. The game throws up the illusion of deduction by having players narrow down the possible locations of each treasure, but the locations aren't fixed and you're not using any clues to actually deduce anything. Instead, the players just decide, step by step, where the treasures will materialize. On my turn I could say that it's in the mountains, near the beach, close to an idol, etc. It's up to me, so long as I don't contradict a previous player's decision. So, like Mr. Jack, Tobago turns out to be a hex game about reading and manipulating space, without any deduction at all. Fair enough.

Strangely, though, I'm not convinced the map matters. Each card you play will later give you the chance to collect some treasure, and you can play a card every single turn. All scoring, all the time. It doesn't matter which player spends a turn picking up a treasure instead of playing a card, because the rewards are all but identical. You can press your luck, position for slightly better opportunities, and claim bonus actions, but when it comes down to it, the deduction is fake and the map is largely irrelevant. It's a short, light game with an appealing theme, some remarkable components, and constant scoring for everyone. Perhaps the recipe for a family game?

RATING: 8
This is a very clever game!

The map (modular with 16 board configurations) has different terrain types and statues, palm trees and huts are placed pseudo-randomly on the board. There are 4 types of treasures depicted by different colour cubes.  

Players attempt to find the treasures by placing clue cards from their hands into the column of known clues for a given treasure. Clues must provide information to help find the treasure, for example a clue might say that the treasure is in the largest mountain region or that it's within one space of a hut. Players place one of their markers on the clue cards they play out.

On a turn a player either plays a clue card or moves their truck around the board. Often the truck is moved to pick up a treasure that has been narrowed down to a single space. The person then adds one of their player markers to the bottom of the clue column for that treasure, then the treasure is allocated. 

For each marker a player has in the clue column (either from playing clue cards or finding the treasure with their truck) they are dealt a treasure card. Treasure cards range from 2 to 6 in value. All treasures are then collected together and shuffled with one additional unseen treasure card. A random treasure is revealed and starting from the bottom of the clue column the player whose marker is present can decide to take the treasure or pass, if everyone passes the treasure is discarded. If someone takes the treasure their marker is removed from the column and the next treasure is flipped up and offered first to the person whose marker is lowest in the column.

Whoever takes the final treasure gets to place a new clue card into the now empty clue column for this treasure, and they place a player marker on the card.

The game ends when the treasure card deck is exhausted. 

This kind-of deduction mechanic and the treasure card allocation are brilliant, there are some fun things to think about especially when trying to decide which clue card to play into which column. The game is not exceptionally deep, there are a few interesting things to worry about but nothing that causes preoccupation. That being said I find the game very fun to play and the theme really comes through and helps make the experience enjoyable.

Still, the excitement of looking for treasure and having that twist where you can decide where the treasure actually is, a truly innovative game.

The components are just gorgeous. Gameplay itself is light enough to make it a good family game - if there's nobody logically impaired as they wouldn't have fun with playing cards to reduce the possible treasure locations. My play experience on first play was hampered as I got hosed every time by the curse cards while another player never got hit. I won the second game by a big lucky move which brought me more than a third of the total points and one point less than the last player got in the whole game. If you can live with that and just enjoy playing with the components this can be a real good one.

One of the best mechanics I've ever seen in a game. I love the reverse deduction. I wish it were in more games, but this is the only one I know about it.

Tobago is rich in theme, being supported by some of the most beautiful art work and pieces I've seen in a game.

It has a nice push-your-luck element to it, with some interesting tactical choices as well. It's complex to explain, but simple to play. I only wish it played more than 4 people.

It feels like a fun toy, but it wasn't obvious there was an actual game there. (Basically any action will probably give the same return on investment in the end).

I'm tempted to buy it for use as a game construction kit, I think there must be something better that can be done with the clue/constraint mechanism that transforms this into an actual game.

RATING: 5
I'm puzzled by all the positive buzz.  It's true that the game is somewhat unique (if you ignore Old Town), and the production quality is high.

But I found the fun lacking.  It was too much work (and too fiddly for such a light game) to see where all the different possibilities were, and when it would be good to actually place the cubes on the different possibilities.

I can definitely understand that many would like the game, but I just found it to be lacking excitement.  I wish there was more cursed treasure, since that's my favorite part of the game.

A simple treasure hunt game that has fantastic components and a cool mechanism for deduction and distributing treasure. 

But the game itself feels like its too easy to randomly make decisions. Since there's no real way to control treasures until the last 2 or 3 cards, at the start you simply randomly place cards and hope for the best.

Game has some swings of luck (one treasure can worth other three). The best part of the game is defining where the treasure is, all the other stuff is ok. Also, great components.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.2
Love the action-based play, the clue cards that actually determine the treasure locations, the sharing of the treasure and the suspense of the curse cards. Lots of good quality interactions take place between players: what one player does often affects the rest, but not frequently in a "gotcha" way. There's a satisfying sense of adventure and self-determination that keeps me coming back. Also, the reversible, rearrangeable board makes for good replay value.

RATING: 8
Very unique blend of deduction, push your luck and (sort of) exploration. Any group I have tried this with has really enjoyed the game, the components are great and have a nice treasure island feeling. I use this often as a stepping stone game (a little bit up in complexity from a gateway), plays well with all player counts in my opinion.

Played it with two and three players. Both combinations work well. With two players you have more time to catch-up, with three players there's more interaction on the treasure paths.

Besides the beauty materials, I really liked the mechanics and how you poker for treasure cards. You need some luck as well to close out early treasures, though. If other players keep you out of contention for the first non-cursed treasures, you might never catch-up.

Early Spiel des Jahres candidate from my point of view.

What I love best is that you are playing two games in one. The push your luck treasure split is a mini game within the game. Snatching a treasure that you didn't contribute much creates tension. Secret knowledge of the curse cards makes for memorable moments.

Worth the import (not to mention how much cheaper it was overseas)! I really love this game, it is just so much fun. My husband adores it too so this is an easy one to get on the table. The "deduction" mechanic is fantastic. Only complaint is that you really need a randomizer to setup.

Played on BGA - lots of fun so importing it from Amazon.de.

RATING: 7.8
Has clever "clue" mechanism to reduce the possible locations for the treasure. In my experience certain combinations of clue cards are much easier to visualise than others. Some people just do not "get" this game at all as they cannot mentally convert the cards into cube locations. You might want to try this out with the prospective players before purchasing it.

A bit luck-heavy sometimes, can be tweaked with minor house rules though if you want a more gamers' version. Easy to teach, non-gamers usually grasp this on the first play. The backwards-deduction mechanism is original and quite fun.

Another great deduction game with a twist - you play clue cards to narrow down where the treasure is going to be.  Players can collectively work with one another or screw each other from getting a stake in the treasure.  Revealing the treasure cards one by one always brings a good laugh.

Even with playing some of the rules wrong on the first few plays, the game was still a blast to play.  Seems like a game that will hit table often because of the playing time and the variable board.

Some nice and new idea here. If you've played Old Town, then you are familiar with the way, how you will find the treasures. But new idea here is the way, how you split the treasure.

Tobago is an adventure game, in which the players possess different parts of treasure maps. During the game, more and more information about the locations of the treasures are revealed, and the possible locations are narrowed down. When a player identifies the location of one of the treasures, they try to reach it as fast as possible to secure the findings.

Great easy game.  It is fun to play with new players and seasoned players.  It has unique mechanics for treasure finding.  You place clues, collectively, to narrow down where the possibility of a treasure is.  Once you narrow it to one specific place, each player who contributed clues gets to be in the dig.  The more clues, the more treasure you can come home with.

It is so different from other games, it really stands on its own.  I play it several times a year.  It is easy for friends to learn an enjoy.

Played once, 4 players.  Better than I expected, but it is pretty random.

Probably won't buy, but I would play again.

RATING: 5.5
A very light affair with lots left to chance / happenstance.  Slowly reducing the possible positions of the different treasures is an interesting exercise but not an especially fun one.  The number of significant choices is overall rather limited and there's not much there that deeply matters despite what the fans of the game may think.  On the upside it plays fast, is very easy to teach and is very accessible.  Not a bad game but certainly way overrated.  Fundamentally very much a family game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is one beautifully produced game!  I really enjoyed the whole aspect of clue giving in developing the treasure map for each of the four treasures in the game on the island and how each time you contribute a card ensures you a chance to pick up some treasure - placement of where you are does matter to some degree as well!  One can choose to move either their ATV or play a clue card which continues to narrow down options  for where a treasure lies.  This feels cleverly done.  I found the game enjoyable and fairly unique.  I'm thinking that diversifying your opportunities and participating in as many hunts as possible is the best way to go.  If you have a treasure hunt where you have a lot of your own markers involved and a curse comes up - you are screwed.  Game over!

Shades of a refined and beautified Old Town exist.

The puzzle solving part of the game, narrowing down the treasure locations, is both inspired and elegantly realised.
The rest of it; the driving around and the amulets just seems very clunky in comparison. It's not terrible, but the latter seems to have no thematic relevance and is just in there to add another dimension and/or for play balance.

Don't be fooled into thinking this is deduction; it's not. There are 4 piles to play into. The clue cards are rules. Once a few rules are in place you can place the cubes from a particular pile out on the board adhering to the rules as a visual aid. 

Your real goal is to steer the last cube/cubes toward your area to you can score the color and get first choice on treasures.

There are some real decisions to be made here, though the luck element still leaves a good deal of guess work. This should be played at a brisk pace for best results.

It currently sits on the bubble to see how it fares after repeated plays.

You are exploring an island in an SUV to find treasure.  You get pieces of a map that reduces the number of hexes where the treasure can be.  When there is one location remaining, you claim the treasure by moving to the space where it is.  

The game is very investing in that it teaches you basic set theory.  This is a valuable skill for computer programming and database design.  

The game feels a bit samey over time, but it is one of daughters favorite games.

Tobago is a Clue deduction game, each player can place a clue (add a new piece to the treasure map) that gives an indication to the treasures whereabouts.
Once the treasures location has been confirmed via positive and negative logic (eg. it's not on a beach), then the players will race to uncover the treasure.
The treasures size is indicated by the amount of clue pieces that were used to find it.
The treasure is then divided amongst the players who contributed to finding the treasure via clues or the actual uncovering, the more clues you add the bigger your share, the later on in the piece you contribute the better your treasure choices.

Seems like a great family game with wonderful gateway gaming potential. In the same way that Stone Age and Pompei have been a big hit (and Hollywood Blockbuster too), I think that this game might also be a big winner. 

It seems simple enough with lots of theme and just a bit of thinking to not make it even come close to being a middle weight brain burner.

8/2010 I'd add a touch of "Deduction" to this games characteristics description.  By playing treasure map cards we eliminated possible treasure location until only one possible site - then the race to excavate this treasure begun.  And so the game continued until all treasure was discovered.  In hinsight we should have used the wild-card amulets alot more in influencing.

I had originally passed over this game, but my wife wanted it as a gift for Christmas. I'm glad we got it. The reverse-deduction mechanic, where players place clues to establish where the treasure is hidden, is great fun (and on a sidenote, probably quite educational for young kids). The outcome seems determined by luck at first, but after a few games some strategy will emerge. This is quite different from most games, and Euro lovers should certainly find a space for it in their collections.

Not a brain burner by any stretch, but it is just complex enough to make it a lot of fun for a pretty simple game.
Mechanics can be a bit counter-intuitive. Not a game of deduction, it is a game of reduction. Digging up treasures is ultimately less important than locating treasures. Variable map board set up yields a ton of variation. Components help sell this as it is a pretty game to throw on the table.
Gotta say, think this game is great.

The central idea of determining piece by piece where the (impressively numerous) treasures are hidden on the island of Tobago is brilliant and, possibly more important, a really innovative approach to the treasure hunt. Spinning a working and enjoyable game out of this idea is also well done, with all the little tricks of treasure distribution and the extra coins gifted by the stone guardians. Very good, and I’m keen to play again.

RATING: 7
Very unique game with reverse deduction.  Offers quite a few opportunities to screw your opponents and allows some chaining of actions with amulets that can catch your opponents by surprise.  It may be simple rules-wise, but there are lots of things to consider on your turn and how something will impact the future.  Upon reading the rules, I thought it would be a nice step for new gamers after Ticket to Ride.  After playing it, I think they should have a few other games under their belt first.

RATING: 7
If you are looking for a slightly advanced family game with lots of fun, clever reverse deduction, great pieces, pirates and cursed treasure stop reading this and go out and get Tobago!

This is a family favourite. The board, pieces and presentation of the game is fantastic. The island board can be set up in 32 different ways and there is always a largest and smallest of each terrain type whatever the set up. Did I say this game was clever? Up to 4 players are treasure hunters scooting all over the map in jeeps (landrovers for the Brits) and collectively via a brilliant reverse deduction mechanic adding to treasure maps that whittle down the possible locations of 4 different coloured treasures (we say the treasures of pirates Brownbeard, Whitebeard, Greybeard and Blackbeard). 

On your go you either play a map card to one of the four treasures (belonging to previously mentioned hirsute pirates) thereby reducing the possibilities for its proverbial X on the map, or, you move your jeep (landrover really, as everyone knows they are the best rough terrain vehicle) across the map trying to jocky yourself to be in the best position to get there first once the final resting place of the pirates pension fund is discovered.

If this wasn't enough fantastic-ness in a box the process of sharing out the dug up treasures is brilliant. Everyone gets a treasure card (values 1 - 6) for each part of the map they contributed to finding the treasure, you also get a treasure card if you dug up the treasure. You look at these values and then hand them back to the "dealer" who adds another treasure card blind and shuffles them up. So the more you contributed to finding the treasure, the more info you have of its value and the more of it you are likely to get. But don't forget there are two curses in the deck. So it maybe that the curse was the extra unseen card that was shuffled in ... or it may be that one of your fellow treasure hunters now know the treasure is cursed, or you may be the only one who knows and are now looking to bail out and grab anything of value as soon as you can. 

The treasure is distributed by offering it one at a time to the players who helped find it starting with the player who dug it up, and then back up the map piece line. So you may know there are a couple of six's in there so you may refuse the first few 2's or 3's as you are waiting for the 6's ... but also if someone starts taking anything of low value you get the idea the treasure is cursed and they are grabbing what they can as as soon as a curse comes out you are all doomed forever! Well not quite you lose your highest value treasure you have already collected throughout the game and the rest of the current treasure is not distributed ... that is unless you have picked up a magic amulet. 

Did I mention the game has magic amulets, that mysteriously seem to be found along the coastline after the majestical turning of the statues. These magic amulets let you do .. well they let you do almost anything ... well loads of stuff at least. Too much for my weary fingers to relate here.

It was fantastic watching my 7yr old son in our last game. He pulled a face when looking at his treasure card but then it quickly evaporated and he remained silent, not his usual self. We all cottoned on to the fact that he has difficulty coping with the stress of certain situations in gaming. He had just seen the cursed treasure. We all started hoovering up the low treasures that were coming out, anything would do, and as he was last to get a choice (he laid down the first 2 map pieces) no treasure was reaching him for him to collect. We were all out of chances to get the treasure and sat back satisfied we had baled before the curse came out. The next card was a six, he collected it, then a five, he took it again with a smile ..."fooled you" he laughed, there was no curse ... we had just been truly played. Oscar for Jack!

This is a great family game, did I mention it was really clever?

Very beautiful components and overall artistic design. I also like how amulets add complexity and allow different strategies in each game.

RATING: 8
Fantastic gateway game! It's definitely on the light side, which only makes me want to get it to the table more often. The components (and insert) are outstanding, by the way!

Update 4/26/15: After a second play, I wanted to expand on my former comments by listing some pros and cons for Tobago. 

Pros: 
+Great components, art and insert (some of the best I've seen)
+Unique. I don't have anything else like it in my collection (reverse deduction)
+It's interactive and fun. Even in a 2 player game, you are constantly watching and playing off of your opponents moves. The distribution of treasure adds to the interactivity in a positive way. 

Cons:

-It's swingy. The game can create considerable swings in a single turn. Depending on how the treasure comes out (mostly luck of the draw) you can go immediately from first to last, or the other way around. 
-It runs a little long for what it is. We've played it twice now and both times were 90 minutes or more. If it played in 45 minutes to an hour (max), the game would be more appealing. 

Overall, a solid and unique game with what seems like great legs. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played three times so far. This is light,fun and clever game. 

It's suppose to be an exploration game but it really isn't.
Instead of treasure being in set locations on the board, the players sort decide/force where various treasure will be found by the cards they play. I recommend the game, but it may not satisfy that sense of exploration you may be looking for.

Ordered November 16, 2009

Played multiple times during Great Lakes Games 2009 and had a blast.  It's light, easy to teach, and fun. Player interaction is moderate without a lot of opportunity to screw your neighbor. Some of the card iconography takes a bit getting used to. It's common to not have enough cubes to indicate where a treasure lives early in its life depending on what card starts the row (e.g. Not on the beach) so get used to keeping track of where treasures are even when there are no cubes on the board to indicate it. Takes some mental gyrations and some spatial skills to see how your cards affect (reduce) the likely locations of the treasures.

Reverse deduction game sounds pretty complex, but surprisingly it's not. I'd say the weight should be bit higher than bgg 2.1 however, the learning process takes a while despite reasonably short rulebook. Second surprise is that the feeling of treasure hunt comes through, at least somewhat. Tobago is fun. Not my favorite or anything, but it's unique enough to earn a place in my small-ish collection. It's also good-looking and has variable setup for decent replayability. Solid game.

Fun treasure hunting game. Great looking components.  Plays really well with 4 players (apparently no so well with 2).

This is a qualified "9" -- Tobago is a very good, very fun FAMILY game that I will play anytime on family game night.  I wouldn't go to a game con or anything looking  to play in the World Championship of Tobago.  But this is a fun, light to light-medium game that the entire family, especially a family with diverse gaming interests, can enjoy.  The components are VERY attractive -- love the moai statues and the palm trees -- and the cleverly designed modular boards are cool.  For families, a good exit point from Monopoly and entry point into more fun, weightier family / Euro games.

A reasonably fun game with a nice, light-hearted theme and mechanics. Everything in the game fits together fairly well and the game's look fits it well. The biggest problem is that it is too long and repetitive for a game with minimal strategy.

I was very taken with this game right away -- the components are awesome and the play feels very unique.  After a few plays I do wish it was a bit faster -- it seems to take a while for most players to review the available card implications and decide on a move.  Overall, I still enjoy it quite a bit and am hoping it will become a regular family game as the kids get a bit older.

Treasure-hunting, searching for clues
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a great family game.  It is nice and simple to pick up and it is still enjoyable even with a fair amount of luck involved.

In Tobago the players are treasure hunters on an island.  At all times there are 4 different treasures that players are trying to locate on the island.  This is done by playing clue cards that eliminate possible locations of a treasure.  For example, a card may say that the treasure is on a beach, later somebody could add that it is also next to a river, then somebody could say it isn't within two spaces of a hut.  Eventually the location of the treasure is down to only one possible spot.  Then one of the players needs to drive their atv over to the spot and dig it up.  Your reward for digging up the treasure and for adding a clue card is a stake in the treasure.  The treasure cards range from 2 to 6 coins.  In reverse order that you place clues people are offered treasure cards in which they can pass, letting the next person choose, or they can take it.

This sounds nice, but of course there needs to be some twists as well.  After a few treasures have been dug up the treasure cards have a couple of curses randomly mixed in.  When these come up everybody who had a stake in the treasure lose out.  Also, you need an amulet (these are spread around the island and can be picked up with your atv) to protect yourself or you lose the best treasure card you've received so far.  After all the treasure cards have been depleted the game ends and players count up their coins.

I think this works great for a family, or some new gamers.  For sure this is a great gate-way game.

I like to think of this as a reverse deduction game. Thematically, I'm discovering clues that narrow down where the treasure is hidden. But in reality, I am choosing which clues to play on treasures of choice, deciding where the treasure should be. This is a delightful switch, as I can push it closer to me for easy pickup, or stack the deck in my favor, or spread myself thin to get a little piece of every pie. A fun, fast-playing game that offers quite a bit of flavor as well.

Beautiful to look at (if not a bit fiddly to set up and play) but the deduction aspect of the game seemed to confound everyone I introduced this to (and I pride myself on explaining games fairly well).  I'm not a huge fan of deduction games myself and as that's the primary draw in this game (and coupled with other gamers' dislike for this title) I couldn't see a good reason why some other Geek shouldn't derive some pleasure from my copy...

Fantastic deduction game that is marred by amulets that are overpowered and change the gameplay, a map and movement on that map that is overcomplicated and overworked, and an issue with two curse cards that can really shaft you if you get them.

Lovely production value and a clever treasure mechanic coupled with clunky action point allowance and a general lack of interest from my gaming groups keep this one on the shelf. I think it's entirely pleasant, though, and can't bring myself to get rid of it; I keep thinking it could be the gateway game for a group I haven't met yet.

RATING: 7
Calling it "deduction" is not quite right, as it's actually in reverse: players have the power to choose how to narrow down the possibilities in ways that are in their best interest. 

The treasure sharing mechanic is really nice. It's a good example of one of those games where "I need your help to find treasure, but at the end I'm going to stab you in the back and take the best parts of it myself."

RATING: 6.6
A light to mid-light euro game where explorers chuff about an island looking for treasures. Only one play, but the one game I did play was very enjoyable. 

Of particular note is the way that clues accumulate (and are resolved) and how the directions of the monoliths change. Sound strategy is (usually) rewarded and attractive playing pieces and good production values make this a game well worth trying.

I will consider purchasing this game.

Elképesztő kivitelezés!! Gyönyörű tábla, és játékelemek (a szobrok woooowww!), változatos kezdési lehetőségek. Ez kell is hozzá, mert csak a játékmenetet nézve, könnyen rá lehetne unni a játékra. Vagy haladunk a terepjáróval, vagy a kincs lelőhelyét szűkítjük. És ennyi. Az amulettek emelnek egy szintet, hiszen nagyon értékesek (plusz akció) ezért mindig jól kell helyezkedni a terepjáróval! + A kincs elosztása zseniális!
Eleinte bonyolultnak tűnő, ám egyáltalán nem összetett, szemet gyönyörködtető családi játék. (3290Ft-ért pedig kifejezetten megéri!!:P)

Rush around an island in your jeep and use your hand of cards to add clues to the whereabouts of treasure. The whereabouts will slowly reveal themselves through a process of elimination - at which point, it's a mad dash to see who gets there first, and who decides to spend their time and effort somewhere else in the hopes of fortune of glory. I really enjoyed this game. It's lighter, but it's fairly easy to teach. Works best with 3 or 4, but it's not bad as a 2p game either.

RATING: 8
Competitive island treasure hunting game, only you decide where the treasure is! This simple but ingenious idea makes this an interestingly cerebral experience, in which you carefully narrow down the location of the treasure whilst manoeuvring about the island and positioning yourself to get to it when they are finally pin pointed.

The key to winning seems to be getting your stake in all chest locations as much as possible, with actually getting the chests themselves only slightly more valuable.

Modular board, simple play and 40 minutes or less game play makes this a very satisfying experience every time!

Seemed fun! There simply can't be too many treasure finding games.

In my first and (thus far) only game I mostly enjoyed the limiting of the possible treasure spots (a cool mechanic), but didn't really like the driving around the map (for some reason the movement seemed difficult for me to grasp), especially since the actions are so few. The auction phase was ok, but I awakened to the power of the amulets too late and didn't get a single one to alleviate the curses (or whatever them bones were) or to get extra actions. 

The game is probably not very deep & the little tactical side it has is pretty limited, but if you play it laid back and savouring the theme, it is a nice and good-looking family-friendly / gateway game.

The game is very thematic and feels like you are truly fighting over buried treasure on the beautiful island. The clue cards players control add strategy and fun to where the treasure appears. There is a nice blend of luck delivered by the cards drawn and played by other players to make the game less deterministic. The game allows a player with a good strategy to successfully attempt to control how well they perform. The components are outstanding. The rules mixed with the theme make the game quick and easy to learn.

Treasure hunting is a play I enjoyed in childhood and it's very well implemented in Tobago. Play clue cards to reduce the number of available spots ("in the jungle", "next to a statue" etc.) or ensure to dig up the treasure yourself to participate in the sharing of the loot. The sharing mechanism is also interesting as you can accept a share or decline, hoping that the next share will be better (but it may be cursed, causing you to lose a share).

The gameplay is pretty much the same throughout and between games so I don't see much depth but for a family game, Tobago would be my first choice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An interesting game where players play clue cards to eliminate possible locations for treasure until there is one location left. Once the final location is found, multiple players may then share in the treasure if they have played clue cards for that location. The statues look and feel like rock, which was a nice surprise. Enjoyable game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
While the mechanic is a cool idea, it just feel flat in multiple ways with most turns having not just an obvious choice, but even an only choice of what card you could play from your hand.  Also little incentive to drive around unless you are getting a treasure unless you got hosed for the round.

A combination of clever and pretty original mechanisms that mesh together surprisingly well – and more theme than can be reasonably expected! The modular board keeps the game fresh, and the island in its many guises seems to actually come alive, in a way.

Relatively simple game with poorly written and organized rules.  It's a deduction game with some "wild cards" (emeralds) that can be used to do some fiddly things (a free move, discarded hand, remove a potential treasure location, etc).  Personally, I find the game lacking in tension.  There is a puzzle-ish sense to narrowing down where a treasure can be.  And each player wants to be in on the "decision tree" for each treasure.  But the game is somewhat sterile.  I got in after watching Rhado's Runthrough, and he made is look like a blast... It's not.  Not a bad game, mind you, but just no drama to it.  There is never really a sense of the big score.  There is no real sense of struggle.  It's more like a game of Blokus (which I don't particularly care for).  All that said, I would highly recommend this an "educational game" to be played with 10 - 15 year-olds.  Also has nice components.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Players are running around a map to find clues to treasures, get amulets or digging up treasures. Treasures can be dug up when only a single location holds the treasure. The players get a look at the treasures before distributing them. There are cursed treasures as well.

The treasure cards range from value 2 to 6, and you can also pick up cursed treasures as well. So I think there is just a bit too much luck for my tastes. But I don't mind playing it, there are some tactics such as not revealing the treasure so that only you can get to it.

Another favourite. Like Morels, I like this game for the experience over depth of gameplay or strategy. There's something about the gradual reveal of the treasure locations that appeals to me :  placing the cubes, a feeling of impact on the board's layout, just engaging enough without feeling pressure.

Didn't really understand the 'game' part of this, feels more like an activity, because you just put down cards to narrow down choice until the place the treasure is, can only be one spot. Then you go there and collect it. There's not searching or having any skill. I guess it's for kids, but even they (12 years old) couldn't see the point of the game and got bored fast.

There are four treasures at any point in time buried on Tobago.  Players play cards to specific treasure to pinpoint where on Tobago each treasure is located.  Each card further limits the spots that the treasure can be, black treasure is in the biggest forest, two spaces away from a hut, and next to a palm tree.

After discovering where the treasure is people than travel to 'dig' up the treasure. After the treasure is found everyone that was a part of pinpointing that treasure (played a card to the treasure) has a chance at some points...or the dreaded curse card.  

It's a good family game that may start to drag towards the end.

An engaging title featuring a blend of hand management, Clue-like detective work, and press your luck.

Very beautiful game. Unfortunately it looked (and sounded) more promising than it actually played. The pure mechanics work fine (treasure distribution better than tile reduction), but owners should add additional cubes. (It is not really necessary to use the cubes as long as only one card is displayed, but it helps.) 
But I will never again play this with those curse cards. They are real spoilers, no fun at all - and according to me, absolutely not necessary!

[2010/01/01]

played 1 learning game and 1 real game... i think this game is cool, but i think it is easy to play "cheap" (squatting near amulets) in this game... plus i think  plp can team up against other plp too easily (not that that it's a bad thing, but i don't think that it adds anything to this game)

i'd play again but so far i'm not sold

[2010/02/01]

Okay, round two... played this, and I liked it... buuuuut... i won (by alot) just playing a lot of clue cards while everyone else went around the island getting amulets and collecting treasures... I even got hit with the curse and lost a 6 treasure...

dont get me wrong, i sill would play it, but i want to play with the alternate rules where amulets can counter the effect of someone (me) just playing clue cards... That would balance the other actions in the game and hopeully make the "winning" strategy more unknown

[b]Tobago[/b] was traded away in a math trade 3/12/14. (Received Jamaica)

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]As a family we never really got into Tobago. The bits were beautiful, but there were parts of the game that really fell flat for us. Our two biggest problems were the SUV movement and the treasure mechanic. As far as the SUV movement was concerned it was not very intuitive and if you started using amulets you really had too pay attention to how many movement actions you used. The push your luck element with the treasure deck was never that exciting; sometimes it felt like you did all this work only to get nothing because a curse popped up before you had a chance to grab some loot.

In the end we loved playing cards to locate the treasure, but that was not enough to save it from being traded after a few plays.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Component quality: This game has some beautiful wooden huts, palm trees and jeeps plus these amazing Easter Island statues. 
The board is made up of 3 sections that can be attached in different ways to create over 30 different maps.
The game oozes theme thanks to the beautiful components.
- We love narrowing down where treasure is located by playing cards, a really innovative mechanic.
- Amulets: add some variety to the game by letting you perform extra actions and protecting you from curses.
- Driving your jeep around the board is just fun.
- I love the push your luck element to disperse the treasure. 

I believe this is an excellent family/gateway game with easy to pick up rules. It is not a game we will play every day/week, but I can see us pulling it out once or twice a month and enjoying it.[/i]

Played 2 player with 6 year old. Didn't like the random setup rules of the huts, palm trees and huts. Felt it was a very lazy design decision. Didn't like the fact that the optimal starting position is always at where an amulet will be appearing. Didn't like the possibility of using several amulets in a turn to chain a series of events and potentially completing and collecting a treasure card by yourself. Felt like I didn't have many decisions to make and deciding which clue card to place at which treasure was often a random affair.

Enjoyed the unique way of distributing treasures the first playthrough with my wife but found the use of the amulets added a little too much complexity to the game to make it a truly great gateway game. Need to play with more players to see how it scales.

In the mood for a deserted island with buried treasure? 

Well, look no more! I love the look of this game and the mechanics are perfect in every way! The treasure maps lead you amazingly to your treasure! Who knows where it will be! The strategy of using your hand of cards and the tokens you can pick up from around the board really make for a great experience! I also love the cursed treasure...I wish there were a couple more in the deck though...to make a greater challenge! Maybe a future expansion will contain such a thing!

I liked this game a lot on the first play.  The way treasure is distributed is pretty clever.  On first instincts, it seems that the tactics of playing clues and passing on treasure allows skill to over come the randomness of the curse.  There is a strong balance between benefits of playing clues and actually getting the treasure.

RATING: 7
You're either placing a card to eliminate possible treasure spaces (and by doing so placing yourself in the treasure dissemination queue) or moving your car around to a found treasure location to get the treasure distributed (and get the best bit for yourself). Turns aren't as fast as I'd hope for in a perceived family game, and it's not as kid friendly as I expected as there's quite a lot of choice for your card play (4 cards across 4 different locations). The amulets then make things more complicated by allowing for clever moves. Which is all good for the gaming group though, where it's a decent game with great bits, and which stands out a bit because it's different from the predominant genres out there. But ... there's huge, huge luck in the treasure cards that come out. A treasure distribution may net 1 player 12 points and another 4 points for exactly the same effort (turns expended). Another player may get nothing (as the pus card skull and crossbones) comes out and see their efforts wasted. So the main strategy is just to play your cards so that treasures get narrowed down as fast as possible to a location right near a car on the board. After all no one's going to want to spend multiple turns driving across the board to discover treasure when they could be concentrating on treasure closer to them. If everybody's playing this similarly, well then it comes down to luck - having the right narrowing down cards, getting good treasure cards ... so it's not much a gamer's game either. Nice components though

What I like:
- Beautiful components (although slightly below my inflated expectations)
- Pretty quick: 60 minutes for a 3p learning game
- Unique mechanic with a good theme

What I don't like:
- Rules are a bit fiddly; concept is a bit counter-intuitive at first
- The game seemed to end a bit quickly and suddenly
- Can bring out some AP

It's pretty thinky for a light family game. I would put the weight more like 2.5.

Good looking deduction game in the vein of "Schinderhannes". I don't know but I still find "Schinderhannes" more compelling, even if I have to admit that this offers more "gaming" value. Still the game doesn't flow well, because of the heavy deduction work to do. Will play this more and decide on the final vote.

RATING: 7
Based on one play: An original idea, where you place cards to indicate where a treasure is and by adding cards you will eventually determine only one hex where it can be. After someone picks it up, all those who added hints will get a chance to get a treasure, but be careful for the curses, which can cost you your treasures. Fun, fast and easy to play. A great game for the family or just when you want to play something light.

RATING: 7
Surprisingly "thinky".  Its a bit tough to recognize when the possible spots for the location of a treasure has dropped below 18 so that you can put the cubes out.  It looks like it could be a child's game, but don't be fooled, adults must expend a decent amount of brain power to do well.  Beautiful components and production.  A game I can easily enjoy once a month.  Not sure if I would want to play it weekly, though.

UPDATE:  I actually CAN play this game weekly and not get sick of it.  Perhaps you may not uncover different layers of strategy every time you play.  Some claim they play this game about 8 or 10 times and explore everything this game has to offer.  But one huge thing this game offers every time...FUN.  We seem to forget that sometimes.  Even though the game can be quite similar from play to play, I still feel tension as I watch the possible spaces for a treasure decrease and I always get a rush when the loot gets passed out when a treasure is dug up.

This game is deduction done backwards: instead of narrowing down the possibilities to find out where the treasure is, you're narrowing them down to determine where the treasure is.  The idea is to play a card that eliminates all the possibilities except for the one right where your car happens to be, or at least close.  This is a very innovative idea, and while you're still subject to the luck of the card draw, the game is pretty engaging.

I got bored of this game within a half hour, and didn't bother finishing. There was no incentive to, really. The second half of the game promised to be exactly identical to the first half. It's bad enough that its already boring, but the thing that kills it is the tedious clue placing. You have to figure out what places are left, the figure out if your card narrows it down, then if you're lucky you can place cubes on the board everyplace the treasure could be. The clues all look quite similar so sometimes it can be a little irritating... Oh, that doesn't mean IN a forest, that means NEXT TO a forest. Whoops! Let me do my turn over again. Really low incentive for driving around and finding things led to people sitting in their jeeps finding treasure via GPS, and reaping the benefits when someone else took their time to dig it up. 

TL;DR - Boring.

I just got this for Christmas 2010 from my husband. It is fun with 4 people and also with 2, which is nice. The game board and pieces are beautiful.

It's got some substance, but doesn't make your brain hurt.

Pretty fun deduction-ish game. It seems to be a pretty tactical game with quite a bit of luck in the card draw.  I am ok with this, but I think it runs a bit long for the amount of luck in the game.

I have played this on BGA. I am glad that I have played it before purchasing it. I did at one time considered buying it but then I've backed off. A few weeks after that I've finally got a game going on BGA. The game is certainly for family members. It feels like a semi co-op game but only one person will be declared the winner at the end. The deduction method is nice, and the amulets are over powering! I was second place in a 4p play. The experienced player definitely won by a big margin but I didn't do so bad among the newbies. This game does challenge your brain, it scratches the itch for you if you like the "mine sweeper" game on windows.

I have to give it Two big thumbs up!
The game has a nice play time to it,not too short or long.
It has a good amount of strategy and I also like that it keeps you in the game looking for your next move even when it's not your turn.
The playing pieces were great and overall the game was very to fun to play.
If I have to say anything negative about it,I would say I wasn't a fan of the game board "I dont mean art work wise" I mean the quality of it,first of all it goes together in 3 pieces then joined by a puzzle like pieces to join them together. The style of that is pretty cool,I can take or leave that but I just think the board is on the thin side and felt cheap. IMO I think It might be better to have gone with the traditional fold out thick square board. Im just afraid setting it up many times might wear it out. But other then that,Loved it!

Update: I bought it after playing on boardgamearena and thinking it may be suitable for my boys but repeat plays online revealed bloated turns with amulets, a repetitive narrative with interest maintained by deciding which card to play to reduce treasure location in your favour or at least be involved in the divvy up stage. However the puzzling aspect has been undermined by the current wave of escape rooms which appeal to me more, with the frantic time element, whereas the pace in the island life is slower....

The overall feeling is the surprise at inherent downtime for a game seemingly aimed at a family market.

Interesting game where you either add a hint card to where the treasure is, or you try to move closer to where the treasure is once revealed. Treasure is then distributed in reverse order starting with the person who got their first, then backwards up the 'who added a hint' track. Very cool game. Beautiful components.

I like the relatively straight-forward nature of the logic puzzle in this, with enough nuance to keep it interesting. The treasure distribution phase is a fun little bluffing/bidding game too, building nicely on how much you helped to find this particular treasure. The components are quite nice too, especially the statues.
It does feel just a bit too random though. For a game with such a strong logic element, it feels like you should be able to do very well by thinking everything through. This isn't really possible though, especially late in the game when people have amulets to do special actions that are hard to predict.

Not sure it has enough control.  Then again, I could see people analyzing to death (what can I do, long term, with these map cards? how can I min-max my movement?).  The problem that I don't think there is really any use for long-term strategies.  I think it's a shoot-from-the-hip and hope for the best sort of game.  More like the game plays itself.  Unfolds for you and you happen to be there, thinking you had something to do with it.

Tobago has a cute mechanism.  The players are trying to find treasure on and island.  To do so they play clue cards.  These cards convey information like "the treasure is in the biggest lake" or "the treasure is next to a tree".

The players apply these cards to one of the several colors of treasure, i.e. the white treasure might be in the biggest lake and next to a tree.  Eventually the process of elimination will reduce the number of potential treasure locations to an individual space.  At which point the first player to that spot "finds" the treasure.

Every clue a player places on a treasure gives that player a part of the reward when that treasure is found.  So it's kind of like players are investing in stocks.

There's a few other minor mechanisms to keep the game moving and add some structure.  It's fun to puzzle out the best way to apply clues so that it benefits you the most.  Players share treasure payouts so there's a bit of maneuvering to make sure you net the largest payout.

A simple family game based on a cool idea.  However, I have plenty simple family games already so I'd never buy it for myself.

I own Schinderhannes, the sequel to Old Town, whose main deduction game on which Tobago seems based. Tobago greatly simplifies the deduction aspect and in its place adds a lot of luck and not a lot of decision making.

It would've been nicer if the game focused on the narrowing down of locating the treasure since its that mechanic that makes this game stand out.

This game is so cool! I didn't have any expectations going into this game except that it was another family game for us. Damn, was I pleasantly surprised. It definitely is a great family game but it is not dumbed down at all. Such creative gameplay and meaningful decisions result in an almost perfect game for me. I say almost perfect because I don't know what perfect looks like, hehe.

Get in your ATV and search a Caribbean Island for one of four burred treasure, tracking it down by contributing rumors you have heard of its location.  The more you lend clues to finding the treasure, the greater the share of treasure you gain.

I'm really glad that I own Tobago because it is very different than anything else I own.  Many people have likened Tobago to clue in reverse and I guess I can see where those people are coming from.  It's kind of a deduction game in reverse.  It seems similar to Android in that each player defines where the treasure is located just like in Android each player defines the level of guiltiness of the suspects. (Note: I have not played Android, so I am making a comparison based on what I've read about Android.)

I spent a surprisingly large amount of the game laughing in delight of placing clues.  "It's within two spaces of a hut.  Then, it's not next to a hut."  Ha ha ha!  Delightful.  

Is Tobago a brain burner?  No.  Is it deep?  No.  Is it worth owning and playing?  Certainly.  It's a delightful and not very stressful game.  It's a palate cleanser amd a game that I'm very pleased to own.

By all means, I should not like this game. The theme doesn't really make sense. I like to pretend the players are all amnesiac pirates who can't remember where they hid their own treasure, so they are driving around the island trying to jog their memory by looking at familiar landmarks. After you spend a number of turns writing the treasure map, someone will swoop in and dig up the treasure and everyone who helped write the map will get to take a quick peek before blindly sticking their hand in the treasure chest, creating a chaotic push your luck element that usually ends up with some lucky chump getting a six gold card they didn't even know existed.

So, why do I like Tobago? Well, even though the theme falls apart under scrutiny, I really do feel like a treasure hunter, and those wild swings of luck usually end with players erupting in joyous hooting and hollering or playful shaking of fists. In fact, the inly real complaint I have about the game is the lack of cubes and how placing them in potential treasure spots can sometimes be rather tedious. Overall, don't take Tobago seriously. It's fast and silly, and surprisingly good despite its flaws.

RATING: 7
This game was a pleasant surprise. I'd heard about finding "clues" to locate treasure and assumed it was a deduction game, but it's not. It's an original and rather delightful strategy game, well-produced, fun to play, and suitable for the family.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
After my first game I wasn't sure what to think of Tobago.  I felt like things seemed a bit random and I was just placing clue cards as often as possible to get the most shares.  I then read a great article on BGG talking about insightful amulet use, and now things have begun to "click" for me.  I see the strategy now, especially since I started using the "advanced" amulet powers.

As has been mentioned countless other places - the components are top notch.  Their appearance alone draws interest from casual onlookers.  I really have no other game in my collection that is similar to Tobago - and that uniqueness is a plus.  Fun, gorgeous game.

The movement and card play aspects of this game do not jell with the treasure collection/curse mini game. The mini game is more interesting but not very enjoyable. I felt like there were several no-win situations and felt far behind, despite all the scores being close together

RATING: 7
Interesting mechanics combine for a game that is not like many others - the additive aspect of trying to nail down the treasure's location to something that you can exploit is neat.  The disconnect between that part and the point acquisition is a slight distraction, but not enough to dissuade me from playing.  I'm hoping to get this to the table some more to get a better feel for it - especially how much control a player really has during the game.

Some interesting ideas that just don't work.

Who said this is a deduction game?  Each "clue" card simply eliminates different possibilities.  If I had played a different card, the final location would be different.  

Certain hint cards seem too powerful.  The whole mechanism is very fiddly.  The selection mechanism of treasure card is tedious and random.  The scoring is ultimately based on random card draws.  Once both curse cards go out of the game much of the tension in the game is lost and the players sufficient amulets can grab several treasures at the right time.  :yuk:

It´s an interesting (and beautiful!) deduction game, which has a theme that I love, and with a difficulty level  accessible for all the family. Like "Takenoko" is, this is a very nice board game, although I think this is better and a little bit more complex. Best played with 4, but with 2-3 players as well (we apply a couple of home rules and the game is very interesting).  It´s elegant, and an example to follow for every creative when designing a board game (in my opinion). Nearly perfect: the more we play it, the more we like it. I love this great game!!

17-03-2014. Rated after 1 play. Nice, gateway-ish game in which you need to find treasures. You do so, by playing cards. These cards lead to you reduce the amount of locations were treasures can lie. Then, X treasure cards are drawn based on the participating players in the hunt. So, there is also a bit of push your luck.

Fun, solid game. Ultimately, a game that I'd be willing to play, but probably won't ask for much.

Very nice components and an interesting deduction/elimination mechanism, but not much more than that. The whole rest of the game (driving a car for who knows what reason, collecting amulets that have no real purpose) feels a little weak compared to that, slowing down the whole thing.

Note: I am a huge fan of Old Town which uses a similar deduction/elimination process, but where this is implemented in a more challenging way. Maybe I expected too mucht of Tobago because of that...?

[b]Caveat:[/b] I’ve only played this as a 2-player game, my :thumbsup: and :thumbsdown: are based on that.

:thumbsup: An original theme.
:thumbsup: Very nice components, with clear iconography. Completely language independent. 
:thumbsup: Easy rules with interesting choices. You really want to make sure you have a (small) stake in every treasure, while getting the timing of when to pick your share just right, and don't let the other players do all the digging.

----

:thumbsdown: I think the 'quality' of gameplay depends on the number of players. With two, it's relatively easy to stay on each others heels while chasing treasures, which makes it more difficult to best one another with clever card play. I'll have to see if this gets better with higher player counts. 
:thumbsdown: This is just a nitpick, but I would've preferred pirate meeples instead of the ATV's. But that's nothing I can't remedy...

One of the best family-style Euros of the past few years. I like the reverse-deduction aspect, and the components add to a theme that actually feels quite strong.

A little different from other games I play, this beautiful looking game is simple and offers enough decisions on my turn to keep me entertained. Not to be confused with a deduction game - the game is really about elimination. You're targeting treasure based on your cards available, where your car is positioned and the investment already made in that treasure. It's all done in a simple way and while it doesn't set the house on fire I find it rather relaxing. No stress, no angst, just simple choices and a bit of fun. Unfortunately I find some of the language used in the English rules around amulets and raising treasure at the start of your movement to be a little confusing. Rules discussion and scratching of heads around the table do slow down the game somewhat. Kind of reminds me of Mesopotamia, which isn't necessarily a good thing. But not quite as creeping step, step, step as Mesopotamia due to the amulets.

It looks like a deduction game, but it is more about hand management and wait for the right moment to play cards.  It promotes the players to do menthal speculations using logic, deduction and induction in order to see the different posibilities in their hand.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I love deduction in games, and figured this induction game would be right up my alley. It was ok, but not really very fun. It had a couple clever parts, how the clues and board interacted, and how treasure was partitioned out, but the movement and cardplay felt slow, and only having 1 action on my turn I felt it was too hard to cause something to happen since I could just do one thing. It's ok. There's stuff here I'd like to see in a more interesting and fun design.

This is a great, fun game. I mean, who doesn't like finding treasure?  I love the reverse deduction mechanic that allows you to build the treasure map as you play.  Lots and lots of fun.

I like how this game has a little bit of everything.  It has exploration as players play cards to find the treasure.  It has racing, as players try to get to treasure first.  It has area control in the way players play cards to get a piece of the treasure.  It also has a little bit of "push your luck" in trying to decide when to take treasure or decline it for something better.  All of these elements come together to make a very unique and very fun game.

Only one play, the bits are fantastic and I think it's a neat idea.

It fell a little flat for what my expectations were, it just didn't engage me - but only half a game at a Con which had to be cut short so we were rushed.

That being said, the deductive step was fun and the bit of bluffing for treasure taking is fun too.  Getting shares in the treasure, clever use of cards and your jeep to pick stuff up was all nice.  

Would like to revisit.

A rare original family game of the classic type. The core mechanic is innovative, the theme and visuals are a bit different (or at least rare), I'm just not entirely convinced at how it all comes together. 

The anti-deduction (narrowing the space where a treasure is) is interesting, but takes a while for new players to get. The thing that bothers me most is the small increment in money - I see the game is made to be balanced, but it's also pretty unexciting. +2 coins, +4 coins and so on. I wish the game's basic premise could somehow be streamlined even more, or they found some way to instil more tension if the game. As it is, it's a charming game, I really enjoy the type of deduction the game asks of its players, but lacks a certain excitement and engagement. I have the feeling there are just too many mechanisms and pieces in the game.

Game of treasure hunting for 2-4 players. Good for casual gamers with a tremendous production value (the game just looks gorgeous). The game encourages planning and risk management, so, luck plays it's role here, but not in the way that it would distract you from the game. 
The mechanics are very clever and the games can be pretty close.
2012-01-08 After nearly 20 games I think that a bad luck with cursed treasure decides the game very often. It's from a big part a game about taking a risk.
2012-12-30 Decreased the rating to 7 as with more plays I do not feel the gameplay provides enough interesting decisions

Enjoyable if pastoral. The pivoting Easter Island statue mechanic is a little clunky. I don't like the all or nothing curse mechanism, so I just play that it knocks off the first person in line.

What a breath of fresh air. This little gem hits my sweet spot for deduction games. Plus, the game play is balanced and plays very smoothly.

What really tickled my fancy was the components though. Hand painted resin statues and I think the trees are hand carved from wood?!?! Even the little wooden "Land Rover" playing pieces have a painted stamp on the wood pieces for the windshield and front grill. Absolutely amazing and probably the most impressive components I have run across in a game.

As far as family-friendly games go, Tobago is pretty ace. It combines an original treasure-hunting mechanism with an equally original treasure-dividing auction, where every bit you contribute to locating the treasure earns you a portion of the loot. Despite appearing simple, it generates a fair bit of angst as players push their luck in getting better loot when dividing the treasure. Adding to the theme are the extremely attractive components, especially the tiny stone heads.  

There are a couple of caveats, however. The 'family-friendly' term is rather subjective, and my personal experience is mixed – the gameplay can be a little difficult to explain due to the less-than-optimal layout of the rule book. Also, players have had a tough time visualising the remaining sites where treasure can be found especially if the map is heavy with clues which state where the treasure [i]can't[/i] be found. The last snag is that amulets are a bit too powerful as a catch-all item and it's easy to forget the variety of abilities they provide. As a result, players may attempt to hoard them to blow them all in one big turn, which generally isn't much fun for other players.

But really, I personally love this game quite a bit. It has a few cutthroat moments where players swipe treasure before other players can reach it, as well as those big surprises when a curse turns up unexpectedly. All this means I'm quite willing to overlook some of the duller moments in the game (which mostly involves grabbing the amulets).

I noticed that there are two different looks to the cover artwork on the box for Tobago according to the pictures I have seen.  One cover is very bright green while the other is  a much more subdued color scheme.   I've heard a mention of a Rio Grande Edition and a Zoch edition.  Do these editions have different color schemes on the cover artwork on the box?
thanks.

Players are treasure hunters: they place clue cards against treasure hoards and try to narrow down the location of said treasure. They then have to drive their 4WD to pick up treasure. Most treasures wins!

Ok, I'll admit it: the logic element in setting up the location of the treasure is clever and unique.

But that's about it.

The rest of the game is standard procedural Euro fare. Action points, setting yourself up to score big etc.

The Curse cards are too flukey IMHO. Ditch them when you play.

Deduction (sorta). Great, fun game of treasure hunting. Play cards to repeatedly narrow down the possible locations of each treasure, until it is found, for shares of the loot. Plays quick, pleasantly brainy, and fun. I'd like to own it, even though someone else in the group has it. Might even work as a gateway game.

Csalódás volt. Nagy várakozással ültem le a játékhoz, mert a leírás alapján érdekesnek tűnt. Kincset keresni pedig mindig izgalmas dolog. Igaz, hogy családi játéknak lett tervezve, de annál lehet rajta többet gondolkodni, viszont ha komolyabban ül le hozzá az ember, akkor pedig csalódik, mert a szerencse szerepe sajnos nagy. Könnyed játéknak viszont a kincsszűkítés mechanizmusa miatt nem igazán nevezném. Szóval családi játéknak szerintem gondolkodós, komoly játéknak meg a szerencse szerepe miatt nem lehet tartani. Valahogy úgy érzem nem sikerült jól eltalálni a játék arányait. Ettől függetlenül próbálja ki mindenki, lehet csak a várakozásom volt túl nagy a játékkal kapcsolatban.

[2011-09-17]
Megadtam a második, sőt a harmadik lehetőséget is a játéknak. Sajnos pár szabályt rosszul játszottunk, így játék közben még romlott a véleményem a játékról, de most átnézve később a szabályt teljesen rendben van. Marad a pontszám részemről. Nagynak érzem a szerencse szerepét, a két halálfejes kártya eldöntheti a győzelem sorsát. Mivel van alternatív variáció is a játékhoz így azokkal akár jobb véleményem is lehetne, mert a két alapmechanizmus a kincsszűkítés és kincselosztás nagyon tetszik.

[2013-03-30]
Kipróbáltam átokkártyák nélkül is a játékot. Így lehet kicsit szárazabb, de legalább csökken a szerencse szerepe. Nekem így jobban tetszett. A fenti korábbi véleményemet továbbra is tartom. Kicsit nehezebb szerintem, mint egy családinak kellene, de gémereknek sem túl jó a nagy szerencse miatt. De ettől függetlenül nem utasítok vissza vele partit, mert szép, jó a két fő mechanizmus és nem túl hosszú.

I wouldn't exactly call it a "deduction" game; deduction implies that there is some preexisting truth that you are deducing, and that doesn't happen in Tobago.  But it is unique, and I bet it would be a fantastic family game, although I haven't played it with a family yet.

I like the narrowing down mechanic a lot and the range of ways you can narrow down the possible treasure spots.  I'm not sure if there's a clear strategy to winning other than trying to optimize plays at a tactical level.

Okay, I have to say, I am a budding game designer. As such, I sometimes notice that certain game designs remind me of games I might have created myself. There have even been several occasions where I've  "invented"  a mechanic or theme that, low and behold, a new game comes out utilizing. "Damn, they beat me to it" i say. Tobago though - holy crap - how the heck did Bruce Allen come up with this? I would never be clever enough to create a mechanic like this one. 

In Tobago players search for treasure by getting cards that depict where the treasure is or is not, but only relative to other objects on the board - and these objects change position each game, and the board is variable as well. So a card may depict something like "the treasure in not within two spaces of a hut. Then another card may illustrate that the treasure is also next to a forest. As more cards are exposed, the location of the booty gets narrowed down until it can only possibly be in one spot - then its a race to get it and unearth it. Really a brilliant, novel design for a game - makes me wonder if there was a time after countless playtests and reworkings that Mr Allen said "oh my gosh, this actually works!" 

Another great thing about the game are the excellent components - some of the best i've seen in any game - and the board is very beautiful as well. They call this a "family" game, but I think there is more strategy then one may think. Lots of luck involved, but this is totally permissible for a game in this weight class. Really though, even if I didn't like playing this game (which I do indeed) I would still have to give it up for the brilliant design.

Great game, and the type of game that is eligible for and should hopefully win the Spiel des Jahres.

It is light and fast and has just enough decisions to keep light and heavy gamers interested.

A great light-strategy treasure-seeking game, with a lovely modular map with different terrain areas and awesome game pieces (love those statues!).  [It might look a little like 'Tikal', but is not similar in play nor as heavy a game].  Terrific production values, relatively easy rules, and an excellent reverse deduction mechanic.  Playing time not too long, and very fun - everyone who has played has enjoyed it.  A favourite.  Highly recommended.

Clever, unique, strategic, and thematic. There's some luck to it, but much less than in Thebes. Tobago can feel a bit too much like an extended logic problem for some and that does detract somewhat, but I haven't played a better treasure-hunting game, and the components are great. But it's a bit of a novelty. Replayability is an issue.

It's a deduction-themed game without any actual deduction! Four treasures will be available at any given time. On your turn, you may play a card that narrows the location of one of these (e.g., in the largest lake, 1 or 2 spaces from a hut, etc.) or move your ATV (to pick up amulets, which give you extra turns or help avoid curses, or to dig up the treasure -- once it's location has been narrowed down to 1 hex). When a treasure is found, each player who contributed to the search (by playing cards, or by driving their ATV to the final location) gets to look at 1 treasure card (valued 2-6, with 2 curses mixed into the bottom of the deck) per contribution. An additional card is shuffled into those, then players (in reverse order of contribution) get to go through these cards one by one, choosing either to take the revealed card or pass. If a curse turns up, the hunt ends immediately and all contributors still waiting for cards must discard their most valuable treasure, or 1 amulet. The game ends after the treasure deck is depleted; most treasure wins!

The board and bits are very nice, and the game plays very smoothly: thematic, fun ... I can see why so many think this is a good SdJ nominee.

RATING: 7
This is quite an original game that I knew nothing about going in.  It all started with me being handed a palm tree, stone head, and hut and being told to plop them down anywhere on the map.  What followed was a sort of build-you-own treasure map experience.  The game is played by playing clue tokens on one of 4 treasures to narrow down the treasure's location and moving around a map to collect those treasures.  There are a couple other elements like cursed treasures and magical medallions but that's basically the entire game.

As you can tell from that description the game is simple and easy to teach.  It also played reasonably quickly.  With setup and explanation a game with 3 people took only 75 minutes.  While I've played games with deductive reasoning elements before the theme and way this game handled it made it feel very new and I had a lot of fun.  Despite the simplicity there are also a lot of interesting choices to make just under the surface.

It also deserves mentioning that the production values of this game are phenomenal.  The pieces are all solid, beautiful and well-made and it comes with a modular board with an advertised 32 different configurations.  And all without a Splotter price tag.

It's not a game I'd want to play all the time (which is the only thing keeping me from throwing it on my wish list right away) but it is a fun and engaging experience with very fresh feeling gameplay.

This game is missing some tension, 2 curse cards are not enough, there should have been more diversity in the gold card pile. And that is sad, since some of the mechanics of "Tobago" are really great, unique even, I love creating the treasure map (=path) and the turning of the statues. But overall the game is too easy to be really exciting. Plus, when you retrieve the treasure there are so many things to do afterwards it makes the game flow a bit awkward. To me, this one slided by the opportunity of being a great game and ends in being only decent entertaining. The look and components are fantastic though, that brightens my mood again (plus, it has instructions in English, German and French, which is good for us).

Not a huge number of plays of this to date, but liking the backwards deduction kind of mechanic with "finding" (dictating) where the treasures are.

Combine this with the movement mechanics, the treasure mini-game, and fantastic production values, and we have a great game here... even if the amulets seem a bit tagged on and not necessary, at least as we've played it so far.

Best family game of 2009. Designer must have played 'Mastermind' as a kid and decided to take the core idea and make it into a fun game by injecting some Euro mechanics and some fabulous components. Not to be taken too seriously, even if some of the deduvtive elements verge on the brain burn. Excellent - though the curse cards add too much randomness.

Somehow, this game managed to not be the "deduction and adventure" game that I was hoping for, yet still blow me away with its clever and beautiful design.  Yes, I was a little disappointed that there's no real deduction happening in the game (just "simulated" deduction, if you want to get technical), but it was still very fun to play.  The way the clues work together (in spite of the nearly endless variety of possible board setups) is very clever, the digging up of treasure has a fun "push your luck" aspect, and the entire production of the game is very well done (the highlights being the statues and the jeeples).  This is going to be a very mini mini-review because I don't really have any criticisms for the game.  Tobago is a fairly easy to learn yet surprisingly strategic little game which dashed my expectations but did not disappoint!  [Edit: This is why I keep my ratings current!  I've dropped my rating slightly because I'm starting to wonder if there aren't enough interesting decisions or strategies to pursue - do I play a card or move my jeep? - to keep this game engaging with several plays.  We'll see how it continues to hold up over time...]  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 7.5/10

Visual design and components superior to gameplay – this is the shortest review of Tobago after 2-player game. Game looks gorgeous and game board, box and initial setup rules are almost perfect, and rules are quite clear and well written, but flat gameplay cannot bear high expectations. Especially phase of treasure discovery is bland. These remarks are especially true in 2-player game. I haven’t tested the game in larger group and I presume that with maximum number of players this game may be much more dense, with greater tension and increased spirit of competition. Anyway, it could be better.

Great game; best I've played this year. Fun theme, low on luck, rewards logical thinking without encouraging AP or being dry. Need more plays though to find out if it's just very good (a 7 or 8). Or maybe it will just stay at 9. 
About it being a family game: not so sure about that. A gaming family, definitely. But unlike really user friendly games such as Ticket to Ride, this one might be a bit intimidating as a "gateway" game. It really depends on how good a sport the people are in listening to the various rules on how to put down clues, how the amulets work, and how the treasure dividing works.

RATING: 7
[Zoch 2009 edition] {Adventure, Gateway; hand-management, bluffing, racing; scalable}  Tobago is an attractive and thematic gateway game.  Player interaction is strong!  The rules are a little difficult to learn but players can manage them soon after the game starts.  It is a very good gateway game.  It is fun, esp. when players succeeded in raising a treasure. It is very luck and is only a tactical game.  And, players are at the hand of other players in the treasure hunting; a player can easily destroy the game plan of the opponents with clue cards.  The decisions in getting treasure cards are more meaningful than I expected - being the last player to collect a treasure card is more rewarding; thus, it attracts player to take risk to stay to the last.  Getting amulet is also more important, both for more tactical options or defending.  The score in a typical game is tight, losing a 5- or 6-treasure card is very substantial; thus, one need an amulet to safeguard the treasure cards.  In addition, one has to balance the movement of ATV and playing clue cards.  Playing more clue cards allows one to have more treasure cards but it also reduces one's initiative in raising a treasure.  Finally, the starting placement of ATV is important; don't blindly place the ATV on the board.  Place it wisely! So this game is not totally luck. Decisions are more meaningful than I expected.

The components are awesome! I love the ATV, trees and statues.  The illustration is colorful and attractive.  The board setup is clever.  I love this game!

L‘avventura può iniziare!
Le casse ricolme d’oro di un favoloso tesoro sono sepolte sull’isola. Una cassa dovrebbe essere a fianco ad una capanna, vicino alla più grande montagna dell’isola: lo dicono i frammenti della mappa del tesoro che possiedi. Un’altra cassa deve essere là dove si sente forte il rumore di un fiume selvaggio. Infine, un’altra sotto i rami curvi di una fiera palma in prossimità di una statua che emette rumori sinistri …mentre sembra ruotare…

Benvenuti su Tobago!

Lasciati sedurre dai paesaggi delle illustrazioni, dal fascino particolare dell’ambientazione e dalle dettagliate pedine. Decodifica i frammenti della mappa del tesoro insieme agli altri avventurieri che sono sbarcati sull’isola. Avverti crescere la tensione. Chi raggiungerà per primo il luogo in cui giace una cassa piena d’oro? Con le tre parti della mappa da gioco potrete creare trentadue isole differenti che vi assicureranno partite sempre diverse e sfide emozionanti.

"In general all three of the above are deeper games that Tobago. In Tobago, I found it was an unclear advantage to remove more or less cubes when you place a card. Which meant that most of the depth was simply in the board movement, as well as pushing your luck when you draw treasures.

In the Clicker games, it is absolutely critical that you maximize the cards by playing them at moments that they give you the most information. Now you could argue that adds luck, but it really doesn't because you have 3-6 piles (depending on the game) of cards to chose from and that's a big part of the strategy. You can also play multiple cards a turn, creating these awesome chain reactions if you plan for them correctly.

Cafe Melange, also has an added layer to this where you are trying to minimize the final location of specific pieces into specific spots, to get the most victory points.

FWIW, If you ask me, Schinderhannes is best with 2, Cafe Melange is best with 3. Old Town is a little behind those two but has the best theme."

Excellent treasure hunting game with gorgeous components. Not like anything else I've played; you play cards to narrow down where on the island different treasures are. Each card also gives you a share of that treasure, as does being the one to dig it up. But shares can vary in value, and cursed treasures can mess everyone up.

First play ran long.  I think that was just because we were learning how the game works.  I really like the idea, but if that length continues, this won't get played.  That is why I am rating this a 6 for now.  I sincerely hope that was just our first game.

2nd game was even worse.  I really dislike this game.  It's fiddly, it's tedious, and the decisions are moot.  This is not a good family game.  Unless you hate your family.

tl;dr: good family deduction game

I quite like deduction games. This one lets you influence the outcome though with cards you play. I quite like it, and it has nice artwork and components. Where I get annoyed with this game is that you can have a great plan and play great, but still get screwed by luck of the draw. If you don't get the cards that allow you to narrow down the thing you're going for, you can't do anything but hope for better luck next time.
I think the idea and main mechanism of this game is pretty neat, but the luck is too high for my taste.

An odd little game.

Once you wrap your head around the way the discoveries work (you're eliminating possibilities) it's a clever little game, if a little overproduced and overpriced for what it is.

It felt like it possibly ran a few turns too long and there were a few times when none of the cards could be played, forcing you in to taking a different action, but these are minor quibbles in a decent, if not great game.

I like this game - it might be higher, but it's a bit more fiddly than I really like.  So that subtracts points.  I haven't played it in a while, but it is fun to do all the deducing and racing to get things before your opponents.

Nagyon újszerűek és frissek a játékmechanizmusok. Gyönyörű szép a játék kivitelezése. Tematika is jól illeszkedik. 

Nagyon jól összerakott kis családi játék, de társasjátékosoknak is kuriózum már csak a különleges játékmechanizmusok miatt is.

Szerintem inkább taktikai játék, mint stratégiai. Logikai következtetés gyakorlására alkalmas, így iskolás gyerekeknek kimondottan ajánlanám.

Mindent összevetve nekem a játék nem igazán tetszik, de társasjátékos szemmel látom benne az értéket, és nagyra becsülöm a szerző munkáját. Igazi játékkülönlegesség, amit mindenkinek csak ajánlani tudok.

14-Dec-09: Played Tobago twice now. Cute game.

08-Jan-10: Played another 2 games of Tobago on Wed. We're getting better at stabbing each other now. It sort of grew on me. It started off as if this was a luck-fest with minimal options. And then someone figured out how to use the Amulet properly to chain your actions. It's a short enough game that anyone who breaks into a substantial lead tends to win. So if someone picks up 5-6 Treasures all on his own, he's going to win. So most of the games now, we collect Amulets for our killer turns, at the same time ensuring that no one else monopolises maps while vye-ing to be the first to dig Treasures up. 
It's a short game, so I'd play it as a wind-down game or as a lunch-time game or two.

24-Feb-11: Read a really good description on Tobago. "It's a one-trick pony. But it's a nifty trick."

How much did you like Venn Diagrams in school?  This is a game that features them heavily.  Players narrow down the locations of treasures by revealing clues, and then race their jeeps over to claim them.  I didn't really like the way that the curses worked, as they seemed a little too penalizing for the randomness level.  Otherwise, it's a fun and beautiful game.

Also very unique premise and mechanics.

This is a fun, light game that jost oozes theme thanks to some wonderful game components. The wooden trucks, huts, palm trees and stone statues are some of the cooles bits around, and the map board is terrific, as well. I think I'll usually play this if someone requests it - after all, it's very quick and light. However, the luck factor is high and there's not a lot of depth, so I don't feel compelled to own Tobago.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Fun game with unique mechanic and more depth than I expected. Nice that it's competitive without being cutthroat, at least with 2 players (haven't played more yet). Theme is stronger than most euros. Board and bits make up a large percentage of the enjoyment. Components shout "German-made quality here."  

I like this game but find myself wishing it were different:
Mechanics are backwards to the theme - you create the location of the treaure instead of finding it. Makes me wish for a game where you actually do find the treasure by deduction. Also, I admire games where the rules are simple but gameplay is deep. That's not this game; the rules seemed a little contrived and overly complicated when I first read the rulebook. But it's better than Agricola and no worse most other euros in that respect.

But the game is what it is. And what it is is good.

Spot in collection: Beautiful, teachable, plays in < 1 hour (1st games without amulets)

Rivals Jamaica as one of the best looking and components I have seen. But Jamaica quickly got traded for its uninteresting gameplay. This is still pretty light, but will be enjoyed by more people and more often. Also, because I can shorten the game easier. If I could have done that with Jamaica, I might have kept it.

Gotten 7 plays of this, but haven't been asked to play it more, starting to fade of the hotness. (Dec 2010)

Played twice with 3 players. First time was played with my 6.5 and almost 8 year old boys. The 6.5 year old didn't really understand the concept of the clues, but would just play one of them randomly which seemed to work fine for him. I'm not sure if there is much strategy to the game, but it is a lot of fun hunting for treasure and trying to outmaneuver your opponents to raise the treasure or collect the amulets before they can. Incredibly beatiful components that are highly functional also. Perfect game for families with 1 or 2 kids.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Tobago is the biggest production yet of a "proof" game:  players use their maps scraps to hone in on a treasure and "prove" its location.  The concept is fascinating, although here it shares the limelight with a more routine game of influence.  The bits are fantastic and the method for splitting loot is game-show drama.  But Tobago is ruined by a lack of card text.  Seasoned players spend a lot of time correcting each other, even after several plays, which costs Tobago a full point.

RATING: 7
I have no idea where my rating on Tobago will settle.  I have played 3 games, and, while I found the game to be fun, it just seemed to turn out the same every time.  With me losing to my wife.  After thinking about it, I realized that I was making a consistent tactical error that she was exploiting nearly every single time.  I was getting buried during the treasure claim--now I know why.

I like it, it is fun it the same way that Manila is--medium length, lots of opportunity for screwing other players' plans up, and great presentation.  It has more strategy than Manila, but not enough to kill the fun.

RATING: 6.5
I got my family hooked on this one and it's a common request when I'm coming over for game night. I often forget it on purpose, however. I just don't feel like there's a whole lot of worthwhile strategy in the game. When it's my turn, I make a decision on what is best for me right then and I don't ever feel like there's an opportunity to develop or shoot for a long-term strategy. So personally, it scores low. But a few people in the family really love it. Maybe they prefer ignoring long-term strategies and enjoy making the in-the-moment decisions better.

UPDATE: The more I play this, the more I see that my initial thoughts were spot on. This game is good to get non-gamers interested and it requires them to think beyond normal board-game thinking. So it scores some gateway value. What this game does NOT deliver, is anything by way of exciting strategy. In fact, there isn't much exciting about it besides the following:

1. It's pretty. People come over and are curious to know how the board and treasure cards work together.
2. It has a sweet bidding mechanic. During the treasure distribution, the bidding is exciting and tense. I wish this was a bigger part of the overall experience.

I'm thinking about putting this up for trade.

UPDATE 10/5/2014

After giving this to my sister over a year ago, I finally played it again tonight. It's a good game to visit every now and then. But in the end, it was the right choice to give it up. It doesn't have much replayability, and is a bit light for my tastes. It's perfect fun for a family night though.

On comment I had is how a lot of people dislike the curse cards, but that puts more value on the Amulets, since they help to lessen the negative effects of a curse. I'm fine with them as long as I'm only playing this once a year or so. ;)

7 for gameplay and originality and an extra .5 for truly nice components.

I used to love this game and would have given it an 8.5 after the first 5 plays or so, but I have found that it slightly wore out it's welcome so I have given it a rest.

It will hit the table again and the rating may go up a tick again.

The induction is truly unique and I think it is a cool mechanic.  I also like the rules for truck movement, also unique.





Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1

A treasure hunt game set on a prettily illustrated hex-based island. Players seek to discover the locations of and collect a number different treasures by adding constraint cards on location (within 2 steps of a palm tree, not on the largest beach) and then collect treasure cards from the hall. Unfortunately there's a mechanism for getting extra actions and thus treasure card and no way to reign in the leader. A cute clue mechanic let down by the rest of the game.

Might have some value as a game-kit as a challenge to come up with non-broken rules.

RATING: 7
SOLD (12/12/15) --- I was very pleasantly surprised by Tobago.  I had low expectations because it was being labeled a family game/SDJ 2010 contender and a deduction game, and I generally don't like family game SDJ contenders or deduction games, so the two combined didn't sound like a game for me.  I'm glad I gave it a try though because I found it rather enjoyable.  It's certainly a light, family game that has a lot of luck/randomness.  However, it has beautiful components and the biggest thing going for it is that it felt refreshingly original.  As someone who almost always thinks that game X feels like a combination of games Y and Z, I was impressed by the fact that Tobago felt very unique, which is hard to find these days.  I look forward to playing it again soon and seeing how it holds up to repeated plays, but the modular board and variable setup make me hopeful on that front.

Although I tend to enjoy deeper games, Tobago was my favorite new game at BGG.con 2009.  I found the creative design and gorgeous components masterful.  Tobago has a nice balance of luck/skill and has plenty of interesting choices, is easy to teach, quick setup/teardown, no two games alike with the myriad of setup choices, and easily plays in less than an hour.

RATING: 6
This is a really interesting little game, and I like some of the mechanics quite a bit.  The components are gorgeous, and play zips along pretty quickly once everyone is up to speed.

The game's scoring system is an interesting combination of investing into various expeditions (almost like Lost Cities in spirit) and betting/risking during the unearthing of treasure.

Very clever title, and unlike most things I would normally go after.  While not my ideal cup of tea, someone who enjoys Euros and/or betting games would really enjoy this.

Sept '10 - finally had our first game - 2 player with my wife.  We are both in love with this one.  Beautiful, interactive puzzle.  Seems to work great as a 2 player and the variability with board setup (maps, trees, huts, statues) means lots of fresh setups.

Hopefully the 4 player game tomorrow night will be as fantastic.

(Thank you Tom Vasel for the video recommendation, by the way.)

update:  3 and 4 player games went VERY well.  still love it, but may drop a half point.  it can be a bit tough on newbies - odd mechanic and lots going on.  the treasure distribution in particular is tough on new players. 

another update:  has not gotten less love.  still beautiful, still fun.  and our relatively-newbie filled group asks for it regularly, so another plus.

update:  upped from 9 to 9.5 based on the love this gets from our not-quite-gamer friends.

I was drawn to this game due to it's visually appealing game pieces, and it's appeal as a treasure hunting game.  While the mechanics do work well together, it's not really a super strategic game.  It's only 4 player, and is just ho-hum after a couple plays.  Give or take.  I wouldn't mind playing it, and wouldn't care if I never play it again.  Bottom line, I'm 0 - 2 with games that look really cool (Relic Runners).

Really nice previously undone design for a game! Fun, multi-faceted. Nice bits. Not much I can say against it. Dispensing of treasure is a little convoluted, and the skulls really mess you up! Box and instructions seem to disagree regarding components, game has 20 amulets, not 21, and has 3 trees, not 4. Huge amounts of random, still it is lots of fun!

Better on paper than in practice - the treasure draw feels a little fiddly and anticlimactic, the reverse deduction doesn't work with everyone, especially once they realise that doing it "effectively" doesn't guarantee a lot of treasure.

Tobago is an adventure game, in which the players possess different parts of treasure maps. During the game more and more information about the locations of the treasures are revealed, and the possible locations are narrowed down. When a player identifies the location of one of the treasures they try to reach it as fast as possible to secure the findings.

Played with two, three and four and had a good time with it on all occasions. With two, the game is a little more strategic (but also a little more repetitive). The game plays more like a puzzle than its components suggest. It also taxes you more than you would think (certainly more than other family games like Thurn & Taxis and Ticket To Ride). The mechanic of playing clue cards to determine the position of the four treasures feels exciting and refreshing. Driving around to collect them is thematic and using the talismans can make for some interesting moves. Only the mechanic for dividing the treasures once they have been salvaged feels a bit too random for me, even though it does add a little suspense. Did I mention that the components of this game are nothing short of stunning? Most importantly, the game still feels original four years after its publication.

10/2012:5
Not really impressed after my first play. Granted there were a few rules we missed, but nothing major to cripple the game. For one thing, the rules are poorly written. Looking at the rules forum section, many folks are finding the ATV movement as well as the amulet use confusing. The ATV movement just isn't intuitive and the amulet use complicates matters.

The card draw is very luck based. Several times in a row, I was unable to play any cards and it was pointless to move my ATV. Yes, I can skip my turn and swap cards, but at a huge disadvantage. A game where that happens due to no fault of mine is a MAJOR flaw in the game. It forces you to ditch cards based on the randomness of your hand with no other option. Poor rule design.

The one thing that surprised me, albeit a pleasant surprise, was that the game played quickly. We were done within the hour. That is certainly a plus for me.

Tobago is visually one of the nicest games I have played. The base mechanic (playing the clue cards) is quite nice as well. There maybe are too many fiddly things and rules to make this a true family game classic though. So I understand why this didn't win the SdJ.

Even though I'm not really fond of the curse mechanic even before I got screwed by it both times in the game I played time, otherwise, it's basically your standard one hour euro. And if I'm going to play a Euro with some randomness, I may as well play Isla Dorada.

RATING: 7.5
great components and good ideas.  a lot of conflict for a euro.  spoiling other peoples plans and mooching off their work is the biggest part of the game.  my only real complaint is that the beautiful modular map seems underutilized.  most of the gameplay happens with the cards, and moving your pawn around the board is costly and often not useful.  either the pawn movement should have been removed completely, the board being used only to locate the treasures, or there should be more to do with your pawn on the island to give you an advantage.  otherwise, a fun, fast moving game with plenty to think about.

Initial impression from a couple of plays: it works pretty good as an adventure game, the part where you get to add clues and move around the board to find the Treasures.

When it comes to sharing the Treasure payout it gets more random than I usually prefer (although it is dressed up in some clever camouflage).

That first part about the adventure should be good for playing with famlies, and I guess it generates enough interest for me to let that second part about the payout slide by for now.

Gorgeous of course, and fun as well. I really like the specific way this game exercises the mind, It's great fun to logically puzzle out how each card in your hand will affect each of the four treasures, and how they can combine to quickly locate a treasure when you need, or prolong one if that's your best course of action.

RATING: 8
Quite a unique experience that combines some of the deduction mechanics known from other games (such as Mr Jack) with a bit of card play and auction. I guess this would qualify as "semi-coop", but it definitely feels mostly competitive. The theme is strong, not least thanks to the great artwork and components. You do feel like you go for a treasure hunt indeed.

Just like in other deduction games, the puzzle aspect of the game is not the deduction itself (which is actually very straightforward). Rather, there is a strategic element of card play (how many clues do you add to which treasure) and area control (whoever goes and "retrieves" the treasure once it is found gets a slight advantage for how the resulting bonus points gets distributed). 

Medium-depth and length gameplay, which starts out a bit slow but quickly gets tense as things progress. High replayability, and a pleasant mix of many choices and multiple possible strategies for victory, although the only ideal move can be quite apparent at times.

This is where the adventure begins!
\13\\13\
Chests full of gold are buried in the jungle - rumors have it that one of them is hidden next to a hut near the island’s largest mountain. Another is hidden where the roar of an untamed river can be heard, it is said. Through the fronds of a palm tree, the proud gaze of a mysteriously scrunching statue casts its spell on the unwary treasure hunter...

Welcome to Tobago!
\13\\13\
The attractive, top-quality game pieces on the lovingly illustrated game board give the impression of a true mysterious treasure island. Each player contributes valuable clues, which determine where the treasures are located. The excitement mounts as the adventurers strive to be the first to arrive at the treasure sites. The 3-piece game board with its innovative design can be set up with 32 different scenarios, each providing fun and a new challenge.

RATING: 8
Really neat game. It wasn't really what I expected, nor is it particularly like any other game I've played. I like the push-your-luck mechanics of the treasures, and even of the clues ("do I play this card to put the treasure close to me, or try to grab that amulet and risk somebody else putting down the last clue and grabbing it?"). My only minor complaints are that there's not really a good way to put the random figures out and that trying to manipulate the treasure is a bit brain-burning for such an otherwise light game, but these are both minor nitpicks; this game is a lot of fun.

This is definitely a family game. There is a large luck component. 

The game uses a reverse deduction mechanic where you play cards to narrow down the location of the treasure, and then everyone that participated gets a portion of the loot. The endgame isn't clean -- the game ends when the treasure deck runs out, and a player with a bunch of amulets can take multiple actions and make it run out.

Good game, but a bit more constrained by cards than I thought it would be. Usual great bits from Zoch.

There was once a time when I was excited about trying this game.  No longer.

I appreciate Tobago's uniqueness, but the randomness just kills it for me.  Be prepared to be shafted by your cards, curse smackdowns, intermittent access to amulets, etc.

Still, I should play again to give it a fairer shake.

A second try: (update)

Yet again - and yes, I know the importance of amulets - I was curse-hosed in the worst way very early in the game.  I won't be playing this one again.

RATING: 7
You use cards to define where treasure is located on the map. Each card describes a condition such as next to the beach or in the mountains. Once the treasure has been identified to one spot, someone moves their token and collects it. The treasure will be made up of treasure cards numbered from 2 to 6 or a curse. The treasure allocation is interesting but can be very luck driven. I like it a lot for a family game.

RATING: 7.5
Rated after 1 game. Amazingly clever mechanisms. It's a lot of fun to put together clues and see where the treasures end up, and the way that treasures are divided works well to reward those who provide the clues and those who dig up the treasure.

RATING: 8.5
Awesome components - the palm trees, stone heads, and wooden SUVs are all really cool, but it's the board that takes the cake.   The way it can be fit together in so many different combinations that all still work with the card possibilities (specifically, the "largest" areas) is really impressive.

The game itself if really fun too.  It always seems to start out slow and just when you start thinking it'll take forever to go through the stack of treasure cards, a few in a row get dug up that take out seven or eight cards each and suddenly you're flying through the deck.

Setting out the cubes can be a little bit fiddly at times, but if everyone helps out it's really not a problem at all.  A few more cubes of each color would have been nice, but chances are if you're running short it's too soon to be putting those cubes on the board anyways.

I just read about some 2-player variants that sound pretty interesting though so will make sure we get this back on the table soon.

This is an incredibly original and unique family game!

But it is too luck dependent for me. It becomes boring after a while.

Light, but nice. Original mechanism for treasure hunting.. It's always nice to see something different in a game.

I wouldn't play this with gamers much but I'll keep this for family play.

Great components, and nice concept, but thematically it makes no sense (how do I get to decide where treasure is buried?).

Treasure hunting with interesting mechanism. Perhaps a bit too complex for what it is.

Active deduction and gold!! Super components.  There's one problem with the setup in that people are often driven to park at the beginning on a spot that will obtain an amulet.

The components and board are wonderful. In addition, I like  the wonderful 'push-your-luck' mechanic of distributing treasure. Only negative in my opinion is that replayability is an issue, I can only play this game once or twice each time before wanting to move to something else. As a whole, a game I would keep in my collection and play ocassionally, but not my go-to game.

This was a blast.  Has a clue feel to it, but the kids can easily grasp the logic.  The treasure "auction" is also fun...nobody feels cheated.  A really great game...and in the words of my 7 year old..."The Tikis move!!"

interesting and very different concept and execution for a game.  it has great mood and plays out very well.  It's not a heavy thinker, though there are some definite strategies.  The bits are terrific, especially the statues and palm trees.

RATING: 8
The assessment that it is light on strategy is a good one.  However, that is not to say it is devoid of any strategy.  There is some strategy in trying to play treasure cards to a map to allow you access to the recovered treasure.  At the same time, you want to try and maneuver the location to one that is favorable to your position on the island.  It is a good design that would work well as a gateway.

Every time this game comes on to the table it's a winner! Simple but effective exclusion-mechanic, a nice unusual board, easy bidding-system, great components (wood and stone!) and don't forget to make an appropriate sound when the sculptures are turning ;) Good as a second game, but we already played it as a starter, second, main, main, main, main, downer. 4 players are best for this simple but addictive game.

This is almost as fun as it is attractive! Inducing the location of the treasures with an eye to put them in a place only you can excavate or that give you a bunch of cards from onr treasure is enjoyable.  Add some card counting to avoid the curses and press your luck when gaining treasure and you have a solidly enjoyable game!

Nice family game. A little more than a filler. Fun game pieces.

Tobago features a great and very accessible deduction mechanic in which every successive clue helps to narrow down the location of a given treasure.  This information is open to all and can be manipulated by anyone to his advantage.  The only downside to it is that as someone starts to dominate in a single entry, it becomes less and less of an incentive for others to help out.

Unfortunately, I'm not as thrilled about the board movement, the amulet as well as the assignment of the treasure cards themselves (pretty much the rest of the game).  Thus to me, Tobago is only a half decent title that plays unevenly.

I was pleasantly surprised with the extremely high production value of this game!  I love deduction games and although this isn't secretive deduction, it offers a unique twist to that game mechanic.

I find the game play very enjoyable to the point where I may even say that the game is somewhat addictive!  I have yet to play a game of this complexity using such simple mechanics that plays so smoothly.

The game components are next to perfect and the game board has to be the most unique I have ever seen/played/owned!  I especially like the resin statues and hand-carved palm trees.  What attractive pieces!

I also have to mention that the box insert does an excellent job organizing all the game components with specially designed areas to hold the oddly shaped board pieces.  Two thumbs up for Rio Grande!

Just enough randomness and luck to give the game some spice, but usually not so much that players can't still control their own fate for the most part.

This is just pure fun. I love that sense of exploration, discovery and excitement when you're raising treasures but the deduction element in deciding which cards to play is what makes this game shine. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
BEAUTIFUL components, Rio Grande has outdone themselves.  Awesome modular board with cheerful landscape art, and awesome 3D palm trees and Easter Island heads.

And the idea of hunting treasure by DICTATING where it can be is terrific.  Fantastically original.

Unfortunately the gameplay is WAY too luck-driven for my taste.  I keep winning games based on curses randomly hitting everyone but me.  It's unsatisfying to win and frustrating to lose that way.  

And why the hell do the Easter Island heads rotate and shoot amulets onto beaches?!  Weird thematic nonsense in a game that's otherwise extremely flavorful.

After 1 Play: My opinion was probably hurt a little by dashed expectations.  I was told this was going to be a deduction game, and that is definitely not the case.

RATING: 8
Interesting treasure hunt game. Players take turns to move their vehicles over the island OR play clue cards (cards that say "in a lake" or "near a palm tree" or "not on a beach") to narrow down where one of the 4 treasures might be found. Each clue played on a treasure earns the player one "grab right" for that treasure. When there's just one place left for a treasure to be, a player can move his vehicle there to pick up the treasure, earning him another "grab right". Treasures cards (numbered 2 to 6) equal to the number of grab rights are drawn from the treasure deck and distributed by a cool system.
The thing that tips for this game is that each time a treasure is found, these stone statues around the island spit out amulets all over the place. Amulets, if picked up, is basically "one extra turn". This calls for an interesting game where the choices are many. Most treasures at the end wins.

My girlfriend said she might want to play this. She does *not* do that. However this one will turn out, it gets super positive karma for that!

Edit: I'm a bit disappointed. Not sure about the girlfriend, she said she liked it, but I don't think the game did it for her.

It's amazing how I fear something as small as a pair of feeble curse cards in an entire deck.

I love how playing a slew of Amulets can flesh out your move into an uber-turn.

I do not rate this lower than a 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, but higher than either a 6 or 7, next to a 9. The number is not an 8.

For whatever reason, despite the high quality components that should have help cement the theme, the big problem we had with this game was that the theme just wasn't there.  We felt we were playing a game instead of exploring an island.

Los jugadores construyen el mapa del tesoro combinando pistas. Cuando se localice un tesoro quien lo encontró y todos aquellos que colaboraron con pistas participan de la recompensa. También podrán recolectar amuletos que utilizados sabiamente podrán darles una gran ventaja. El jugador que recolecte más oro será el ganador.

An extremely clever reverse deduction game with GORGEOUS components. Mechanics allow for some really clever plays, and it doesn't outstay it's welcome at the table (in fact, I've occasionally felt it was a little short). A good gateway game too.

RATING: 6
These little Sliver Line games are what got me into FFG. Cheap and fun. A great little race game where speed and control are at odds. Slow (but not too slow) and steady can win the race, but so can wildly careening across the finish line with a split axel and your hair on fire.

Are all the chariots perfectly balanced? Who cares. It's close enough for government work.

A simple racing game. A good introductory game for kids, that balances the need for speed and defenses.

The possibilities of creating new tracks every game is a good bonus to the game.

The option of ramming and whipping your opponents are simple in mechanics but overall may not be for detailed enough for hardcore gamers.

seems like a decent game.  I bought it as I thought it was the same game a guy runs (used to run?) at Pentacon every year, and I had been keeping an eye out for it.

RATING: 7.2
The fantasy chariot racing theme seemed a bit off-putting at first. Dont know why. There is a lot of fun here and perhaps less chaos than you would have thought for a game involving chariot racing and spell casting. The mechanic of counting your 'speed' cards as part of your hand is a great one. It means you can manoeuvre round obstacles and cast spells, or you can go fast, but not both. Balancing speed with safety is key.

After playing a few times the game is okay with two. My wife and I enjoy it. Think that it will become a bit more fun and choatic with more players. 

---Update--- 
Played two times with four players.
Did have a runaway leader in both of the games that wasn't fun.
I got the feeling that the rules what a bit broken. Didn't use the magic-rules, that maybe could make the game a bit more even.

A fast-playing card-driven chariot game featuring variable player powers (each chariot is unique). The magic spells and hazards are simple but potentially devastating, as are rams and attacks. High marks for fun and simplicity! Everything you'd want in a quick chariot-game! A winner!

A whole bunch of silly fun - plenty of take that and hilarity in a nice short playing time.  Exactly what I want from a chariot racing game!

The hand management system in this game is vital, when setting up your hand you are setting up the cards you are going to play on the following turn.  Ramming and Blocking are not just ways of attacking and stopping your opponents chariots, but also a way of attacking their hand of cards, and their ability to deal with what is approaching.

A fun game, especially fun with a couple of drinks and the right mood.

It's not a broken game, but to use a cliche, the theme seemed "pasted on." I didn't think it was very much fun, either. Plenty of spills, but none of the promised thrills.

Fun racing filler game if played without the fighting and blocking, and a fun meatier race game if played with!

It's definitely a race game for people who like a lot of "screw you" mechanics thrown in to their games.  I'm generally not a fan of that sort of thing, but it all works pretty well here!

Hand management is the key to this game, especially when played with the full rules.

RATING: 4
I was mildly surprised... didn't know what to think of this game, but better than expected. The coolest thing--the use of 7 cards to either gage speed or offer options for avoiding hazards. Great mechanic for a game. 

It's a strange racing game, because it feels more like slow, careful maneuvering instead of a "pedal to the metal" race. We played without some rules such as spells, collisions, etc. and I'm not sure the game suffered much because of it. I'll be curious to see if my rating changes with more plays.

Update: dropped this to a "5" after realizing that I'd play Long Shot or Formula D over this one.

Update: Played this a 2nd time. Not bad. I dawned on me that this is as much a hand management game as it is a racing game. The production value and components are average at best, but it's a decent little game.

Love the setting and the many innovative conventions that they place into the game - the only thing I could ask for is for someone to play towards my love of variant player powers and come up with different "special abilities" for the different chariots (as they're already represented by different fantasy races if you look at the playing pieces).

Fun game!  Sort of a happy medium between Circus Maximus, Ave Caesar, and Excitebike.  Yeah, Excitebike.  Sorry, I just couldn't help but imagine the charioteers running back to their crashed chariot.  Seriously though, this is a simple, fun game that has a great concept for the track layout (random and gradually revealed) and some decent rules for attacking, blocking, and ramming that don't bog down.  It's not something to pull out every session, but it's a good time.

The movement mechanism was similar to Mississippi Queen, which is another racing game I really like.

Fantasy Chariot Racing - Hand Management
(3-5, [b]best w/ 4-5[/b])
_Weight 1.8
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
While not a bad game of fantasy chariot racing (and really, how much competition could it have?), Arena Maximus seems to be far too driven by luck. If you get bad card draws, you may not even get your chariot moving immediately. If you draw the slowest chariot, your chances of winning are slim to none, as you'll likely never catch up to your opponents once they get a few turns in, and you're also likely to take a lot more damage because you can't make those jumps. The game certainly seems unbalanced, which is fine if you just want an hour's entertainment but not so fine if you're looking for a game where your decisions matter.

The problem with this game is that it falls flat on its face. The whole roman chariot racing thing is really a great theme. Unfortunately, this game seems to suffer from a lot of flaws and just does not inspire the players. I think the worst element of this game is that being first place during the race is death sentence. Race in second and try and stay there to the end.

RATING: 7.5
A highly playable and fun little game with some interesting mechanics. You can have only 7 cards total, so as your speed pool increases, you have less to work with in your hand, and you are thus more likely to crash. Adding the optional rules for casting spells really livens it up even further. A good, simple, game that plays in about half and hour for 2 players. Not great, but good fun. I have yet to play it with a larger group, but I'm guessing that it will be even better. **Addendum- I increased my rating half a point over time, as I discovered that my wife and I keep coming back to it. This underdog is a winner. UPDATE: I've since played it with a larger group, and it is still pretty good.  Now I'm playing it with my 6 year old (minus the rules for ramming, blocking, attacking, and spell casting) and she loves it.

Played once.  A decent game, carnage seems to be the order of the day here, although our game was played by a bunch of polite gamers who didn't want to seem to attack each other much.

I'm a sucker for Fantasy Flight games anyway, so when one this easy to learn and yet so enjoyable comes along, I start to gush. I will say that the whole flipping your chariot to show your turn is finished could have been handled better (maybe a greater contrast to the front and back colors) because we got confused a couple times. But all in all a fun game as a light break between heavier games or if you have a free half hour with some friends.

A truly fun, smash-mouth racing game: the very best of its kind.  The rules are simple and I recommend playing it with simple turn order (not with the rule that the chariot order in a round depends on its position relative to the other chariots at the start of a round).
Try it this way and see if you don't agree.

I also love that the designer changed the "hospital" rule so that the repairing chariot that is stopped is not on the track and cannot block others until the next round when it pops back onto the track.

Why do many racing games feel like molasses when you play them? Arena Maximus, to be fair, was fun, especially when players beat up on ech other. However, the more the players interact, the slower the whole thing gets. Will reevaluate after a few more plays, but considering that it already takes too much time for a light game, we usually end up playing something heavier in the same timeframe.

RATING: 4
A game that solely depends on the group.  I think the mechanics are interesting and unique - as going faster limits your hand size, ability to defend and attack, and control of your chariot.  The fog element involved with revealing the track as you race around aids in preventing, more often than not, a runaway leader.  The different class and strength of each chariot also adds a little bit of flavour and replayability.  So why then does something that apparently offers so much, not quite gel with me? Arena Maximus in all it's good intention is flawed, and feels clunky, fiddly, and takes too much time for what it is.  The engine here if streamlined, and cleaned up a bit would offer a wonderful experience- let's hope at some point there is a reworking of this title.

Rather exciting fantasy chariot racing game.  In order to play smoothly, you really need one player to know the system by heart.  That player can lead the others through the phases.  (Do you want to ram?  Ok, do [i]you[/i] want to block?  Do you want to attack? etc.)  I haven't played with the spells yet.  There's more than enough there to start with.  A rather impressive design given that there are only three card types.

Whenever I play this, I have the feeling that this game has potential but fails to deliver. It takes too long for a simple B&P game.

The ramming/blocking/whip attack options detract from the gameplay.

It' a bit fiddly with the counters inside and outside of the track.

Counter-intuitive rules (but necessary !)
 - last players movers first
 - refresh hand card in the middle of your turn

Fun short racing game, with a clever 'speed vs security' system.

Best with 2 or 3 players -with more you have too much downtime.

RATING: 6.5
Not very gamer's game, yet still requires some hand management skills and poses a few interesting choices and decisions.

But there are some issues that push this game for sale for me:
- the game is meant to be wild fun above all, yet new players have no fun at all at first.  They consistently display difficulties with grasping the structure of a turn and particularly - the sequence of events happening when a chariot enters a new field.
- potential balance problems: hit points of a chariot seem more important than its other qualities (elves seem to be screwed); acceleration spell seems more powerful than others, yet it's random which spell you'd be able to cast
- with 4+ players there's too much of scuffle which slows the game down
- I seem to have no group for this game and even I could persuade some players to play AM I have so many better games to explore...

Sold.

Actually a lot of fun, I was surprised!
Some things don't work out in this game, like speed rating, because once you're ahead you can simply slow a bit and cruise to the end. The magic cards add a lot to this though in terms of being able to catch up or hurt other people. I'd enjoy this a lot if we just had a nas car length race and people were up for it. This game is more fun than I rated it actually and deserves more credit than its given.

None of the cards or board pieces have text on them, so this might be a good game for kids.  The burrito boy, 5, beat me in our first game; for a handicap, his hand size was 8, mine was 5.

Update: I like this game pretty well, but the two different groups I've tried this with haven't been keen to play it again.  Maybe the violence isn't graphic/detailed enough?  Maybe it's because I didn't offer the optional magic rules?

Update: even with the magic rules, there wasn't much love for this game with my group.

[2006.Dec.04] I didn't know quite what to expect when I opened the compact box for this Silver Line game (by Fantasy Flight Games). The quality of game pieces is on par with what I've come to expect from FFG's Silver Line; these are good, solid game bits, but not near the quality of FFG's more recent big box games (e.g., Arkham Horror, Runebound, Twilight Imperium). Arena Maximus is half-racing, half-hand management, and half-"kick your opponent when he's down". (Is that too many halves?) Don't get me wrong, this is not a malicious game at all, but the rules do allow for ramming each others' chariots, blocking one another, and whipping the other drivers... so yeah, there's a bit of maliciousness packed into each round. That said, by the end of the game we were all giggling and laughing like 8-year-olds as we did whatever it took to cross the finish line in one piece... er, sort of 'in one piece'. Think Ben-Hur mixed with "I'll bite your legs off!" (for you Holy Grail fans), and you'll be ready to bring this one to the table. The game plays quickly, and is a cinch to learn. Oh yeah, and try not to crash... twice, that is!

While reading the ruels, I found that everything was OK. WHen playing, I found the game a bit slow and I did not like asking everyplayer if they want to block or not.

So I designed a few variants that will probably fix this. I hope so because that is really a game I would like to enjoy!

First play was less than gripping but we were all learning the game.  Not much combat or competition really occurred throughout this game and I pressed my luck too hard at the end causing me to lose my chariot.  Want to give this one another go.  Now that I've picked up Q-Jet, I have no desire to play this one with its extra fiddliness.

One play. Was decent enough, but for some reason it felt like no one wanted to waste their cards on screwing with each other too much. Really odd since we tend to go out of our way to screw with each other in games that don't support it nearly as much. It didn't really have much excitement or suspense to it, just kinda felt like we were going through the motions. I'm certainly open to playing it some more and seeing if I can like it more.

RATING: 5
The idea of a randomly determined race track is great. The idea that going faster makes it harder to steer is great. The idea of obstacles on the track is great. But the game is WAY TOO FIDDLY! The card mechanic just does not work, having to ask at LEAST 3 questions EACH time someone has to go to a space where someone else already is... Too many breaks in the rythm, too many exceptions and mini-rules for the size and length of the game. Could be fun if someone cleaned up the rules, a lot.

Great Mechanics for a Chariot Race. The components bring the overall rating of this down a bit. I think this could be the best chariot racing game out there if they re-think the design on this one. Good game nontheless.

I had a problem with the way the turn order allowed players in the rear to attack players in the front as they passed.

It would be quite hard to become a runaway leader.

I like the way you have no idea what lies ahead of you but must somehow be ready for it.  Different racers and obstacles and even fireballs that you can fling at opponents with the advanced rules.  Not hard to teach, quick and enjoyable.  

Update: Aesthetically speaking, it is not pleasing to the eye, and maybe that's what it needed to be played more often.

RATING: 8
This is one of the most well balanced competitive games I've ever played.  Though this is supposed to be a racing game, it moves much more slowly due to relying more on strategy than luck.  Every move must be carefully considered with a healthy dose of foresight, otherwise a charioteer will find themself out of the race quickly.  My only complaint is the game is overall a bit more complex than it really needs to be.  But once you learn all the little inherent combinations for combat situations the big picture comes into view and it's a lot of fun!

RATING: 5
Didn't really click with me; I found some of the rules too fiddly, and its biggest limitation--being a racing game--was that it unfolded painfully slowly. In other words, the game didn't 'move', and if you don't have that sense in a racing game, you've definitely missed the mark.

RATING: 6
A quirky race game that can be more about inflicting damage on your opponents than actual racing depending on your group's style. Which can make it riotous fun, downright tedious or anything in between. Cards only come in three flavours ... whips, reins and magic. You use whips to set your speed and move along, carrying them over from turn to turn. As you move though, you can be blocked by players playing a rein/whip pair (unless you can match it). You can whip other people and cause them damage as you go past (unless they can whip back), just because. But playing all those damage cards, or keeping them for later defence, means you're not using them for speeding along (ie the main use for those whip cards) or for matching against track symbols to avoid damage en route. So the game is about working out the best balance for your position vis a vis the other players, their likely intentions and what's coming up on the track. Which ends up making the turns a tad slow for such a potentially rollicking theme, and that's its downfall. Nice decisions, but too slow.

I wish I grew up with this game, cuz it's much better than the spinner/roll-and-move drivel. Hand manage cards to produce combos/sets to race around the track, negotiate obstacles, perform magic, attack, and defend. 

Not a great 2-player.

I'd like to see this game revised with some updated mechanisms.

RATING: 2
Play Circus Maximus instead. If that's too heavy for you, get Ave Caesar instead.

For a game so light with very little decision making, the game moves SO slowly. In this game, you are severely penalized for moving too fast (in this case, less action cards). Unfortunately, action cards are essential simply to pass through spaces -- and if you have no cards you incur damage points.

As a result, everyone is basically moving around the track at the same rate of movement, which leads to an extremely uneventful and boring race; there is zero excitement or drama.

RATING: 7
1st play - it was tougher than it should have been to "get" the rules for this, but after a 1st play, we'll try to add the Magic Spell rules in and see if it ups the damage factor to properly punish chariots that have lower damage values. Otherwise, it seems they have a large advantage (why would anyone play a chariot that has a Beast Rating of 1?)

From reading the rules, I'm a bit a wary of how this would play. The mechanism for adjusting speed and what cards you have in hand sounds great, but if the game takes as long Rush 'n Crush it could be an issue. I like luck and randomness and in RnC the luck is in the roll of the dice. You can always do what you want - you won't be screwed by luck of the draw - but the dice will decide whether you succeed. With AM, you can't always do what you want. I'm not sure how fast Arena Maximus would proceed, and the comments suggest that it goes slow. Also, the spells sound really tame, but maybe that's just because I haven't played this yet. I'd give this a shot and might like it, but then again I'm not expecting anything from it either.

First impressions: After two games, I'm pleasantly surprised. Progression requires someone to kind of orchestrate everyone's turn, going through each phase and asking people whether they want to ram, to block or to whip. That adds to the length and may make this feel a little overwrought, but I imagine that with repeated plays, as people get to know the order stuff happens in, players won't need a "gamemaster". Not for the faint of heart, but I can see the effort paying off.

I love it.  It is simple quick and fun.  Sure I'd like a little more out of a chariot game possibly lanes, or rules for turns, but heck who cares when you are enjoying it.  My only gripe is the heal spaces.  The fact that you can replenish you cards immediately means that you can stop, replenish cards, and then block those behind you to easily catch up.  This really should knock some of the wind out of your race if you want to use it.  Otherwise there is no sacrifice.

Clever mechanism for a diceless race game: the faster you go, the fewer cards you have in your hand for dealing with hazards or for tangling with other chariots.

This game sucks.  There's not much balance, as the fast chariots raced ahead and left the slow ones in the dust.  Plus, it seemed that the set of actions that you could do with each player got repetitive - I'm not going to ram, I'm not going to block, resolve the tile, I'm not going to attack.  The advanced game might be better, but I didn't have much fun with this one.

Racing game that seems to take a bit too long. OK as a 2er, but more fun with more. Haven't tried the magic version, although it seems unlikely to be useful - chronic card shortage.

Based on two 3P games [played 6/25/09], give a 6.5. Rules seem to be way too long for what game there is here. A solid, condensed set of rules would bump my score up. Not having the chariots on the track itself is also a strike against it. But once the rules are down, the game goes quick. And as more of a filler game, it is enjoyable, and worth the $5 my wife paid for it for a Christmas present 3 or so years ago.

[1 play] Initial reaction rating.  I would definately play this game again. I loved the theme of fantasy chairot racing.  It played quick and was just a tight, suspensful, fun racing game.  I played a three player game using the optional advanced rule (spell casting).  The game clearly has a lot of luck to it in what cards you draw, and it won't be on of my top favorite games to play.  I didn't immediately want to play it again.  No kids were in the game I played, but I could see it being a decent "family" game.  Some of the order of play might be confusing for really small kids but older kids would catch right on I think.  But certainly a game that I enjoyed and if I got the chance to play it again I would be more than happy to.

This is one of the better racing games once you've played it 3 or 4 times. All the options to ram, block, attack defend and steer past the obstacles from essential 3 types of cards is great design.

RATING: 4.5
When played with the "advanced" rules (i.e. the ability to cast spells), this is a pretty enjoyable, albeit slightly chaotic, game. With all the actions that both you and other players can take during your turn, it clearly gets more enjoyable as players follow the checklist of actions without thinking and play speeds up considerably. Without the spells, though, the basic game is pretty soulless and unexciting as players stick close together during the course of the race and the different chariots seem somewhat unbalanced (favoring the ones with higher beast and driver values and less armor).

Commented after one game. We played couple of rules incorrectly in the beginning, but after a while the flow of the game started to be good. Not a bad game, not a great game, but something that I am ready to play again in the future. Quite light.

Second play with three players. This time we got all the rules right, but we just forgot couple of them in the start (including blocking and attacking etc). :) It was a while since the last play, so it took some time to get the play started, but after the start the game was quite fast. I think it needs to be played more aggressively to be more enjoyable.

"WOW" IT WAS A BLAST! Hhehheehhehe. Combining other games with Arena Maximus is quite funny actually.

Currently, my nephew is racing with his Heroscape miniatures and set the track behind his castle! Genius! ;-)

I thought I would like this, and I did at first, but after a couple of plays I realized there's not much here...traded

While not the heir apparent to Circus Maximus I was hoping for, Arena is a fast-paced racing card game that is easy to learn and ultimately satisfying -- I just wish it were a wee bit deeper to be able to make a meaty campaign/season game out of or offered greater variety among the chariot teams.

After one game this seems to be fun little nasty game.

I haven't really looked at this one. I am hoping it is like Circus Maximus from Avalon Hill but with more options.

Not a bad game. The hand management is a clever way to control your car. However, the game is too long for what it is.

Odd feeling of no control while traveling at high speed.

Not too keen on the fact that the leader is almost running blind, as the front section of the track is only revealed when you're almost on top of it.

Fantasy chariot race. Niceish. Boring with only 2 players. The more the merrier. Has a runaway leader problem - fix: the fastest accelerating chariot should not go first.

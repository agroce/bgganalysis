It's ok, but no great shakes.  A kind of domino come pattern making tile-laying game with nice but quite gaudy art.  I've played better of it's type.  I've also heard that this goes for a lot of money - I don't know why.  I don't think that's warrnated at all.

Pretty cool game.  Tile-laying, land grab-and-hold.  Seems like you'd want to battle longer over land, but the game ends very quickly, more like 45 minutes.  Pretty vicious for a farming game.

I was in the minority on this one but I found the game to be "meh". The design was clean, the rules were simple, but I just found myself not really caring whether what I did was the right move.

I'm not likely to remember this game in 2 months.

Χαλαρό tile-placement eurogame με αδιάφορο αγροτικό θέμα. Σπέρνουμε χωράφια τοποθετώντας στην γύρα μας ένα από τα tiles μας στο κοινό ταμπλό, και είτε σκοράρουμε VP ανάλογα με το μέγεθος του χωραφιού που μόλις φτιάξαμε/επεκτείναμε, είτε ανεβαίνουμε σε κάτι κλίμακες με ζαρζαβατικά ώστε κάποια στιγμή να ξεκλειδώσουμε έναν αχυρώνα που μας επιτρέπει να κλειδώσουμε κάποιο χωράφι για πάρτι μας ώστε να μας δίνει κάθε γύρα πόντους.

Βασικά το παιχνίδι είναι πιο απλό από ότι το παρουσιάζω. Αυτό δεν σημαίνει πως είναι κακό. Απεναντίας οι απλοί κανόνες του δίνουν γρήγορο ρυθμό ενώ το γεγονός πως όλοι σπέρνουμε στο ίδιο κοινό ταμπλό αυξάνει κατακόρυφα την αλληλεπίδραση.

Το παιχνίδι είναι κατάλληλο για εισαγωγή στο χώρο. Το θέμα του και τα γραφικά είναι κάπως αδιάφορα αλλά οι μηχανισμοί δουλεύουν μια χαρά.

Good family game. Plays fast with plenty of tension as you wait to see if your plans will be wrecked before your turn comes around again. Not entirely sure I was convinced by the theme - I get that I'm trying to expand my corn farm but not sure why a neighbour can suddenly plant wheat over it. Haven't I got a shotgun? But never mind that, the mechanics are simple to grasp but with difficult decisions to make.

I have a hard time putting my finger on why I like this game so much.  It has a horribly boring theme, and doesn't implement that theme at all in the gameplay.  By all rights I should hate this game, and yet I find it so enjoyable.  I greatly appreciate the multiple paths to victory.  It allows you to figure out your own balance of straight points, shooting for end-game bonuses, and diversifying to claim areas that will give you in-game bonus points.  I've seen people win the game focusing in all 3 areas, so I love the variety that creates.  While it seems like each game might be the same as the last, it only takes a few tiles before things change.  There's also some opportunities to block your opponents, and that adds a good amount of interaction to the game as well.  This game came from one I'd never heard of, to one I'll never let out of my collection.  You owe it to yourself to give this little-known game a try.

A pretty neat tile laying game where you have a choice to make of what type of points you'd like to score with your placement.  Do you take victory points which are immediate points, or take farm points which will yield you long term points?  The game does take some conspiring to bash the assumed leader, which I don't like so much, but overall the game is good enough to look past that a little.

Using domino style tiles you gain points for creating big fields of different produce or points in the barn which eventually let you claim a barn and reserve an area for yourself that scores turn after turn. Very Nice. 3 Plays

The first time I played it, it seemed a little dull because my gaming partner didn't really understand the scoring mechanisms. We played it again today (after both of us thoroughly reading the rules), and it was much better. It makes for a tight game when both gamers are equally matched. It seems to be commonly viewed as a family game. I think that is a mistake because it can be quite boring when players are not equally matched. It is much more enjoyable as a lighter game for medium weight gamers.

Farming theme - Tile Placement

Kinda like farmer dominoes.  Tile placement leads to scoring both sides of the "domino" for either points or movement on one of the barn tracks.  Said tracks can earn you bonus points and even unlock your BARN OF POWER which automatically scores points each round for the rest of the game!  It's fun.  Even my 66 year old parents like it.  Win.

This is a game about farming, but the theme isn't really important.  Peer underneath and you'll find an interesting tile-laying game with a side race element to keep things interesting.

Players place field tiles on the board, trying to create large farms of one crop to score points.  As the board progresses, the fields get stacked on top of each other.  To claim a field for yourself you need a barn, and that's where the other side of the board comes in - an alternative to points is moving your marker up the row for a given crop.  Once you get all your markers past a certain point, the barn is yours to claim a farm.  Also at the end of each row is a farm animal worth big points if you can get there first.

Completely unlike what I expected and a real brain-burner.  This game has a slight hint of nastiness, so don't be afraid to get aggressive when you have to - point opportunities abound.  I like this game!

This is a pretty immediate tile-laying game, with a stacking and overlapping element.   In short, it reminds me a ton of Hanging Gardens, but everybody plays on the same grid in this game.  You can choose to score your areas (again, the same as HG) or advance your 5 barn tracks.  This part has some Tigris+Euphrates in it, because if you advance all categories equally you get barns that function like the T+E monuments.  And that's my only gripe about the game - it doesn't have anything that hasn't been done before.   Good for what it is, though, and pretty quick.

Very good game. The setup was slightly confusing until we understood the game process, and then it seemed obvious. We also mistook the rule about when you placed your farm, until we read it properly and understood that you needed all 5 markers up to the farm token, not 1 token. The gameplay started out slow and my strategy paid off big time early, but the game developed in a very interesting way and I lost badly. As players build fields, I took VPs instead of farm points and was last to place a farm (and hence missed out on high value livestock). About halfway through, the player who'd taken farm points and not VPs suddenly started scoring massively for his farm, round after round, and continued to take farm points, getting him to the best livestock and huge final score.

One of those games where if I'd foreseen that, I'd have played differently, which of course means the others would have played differently. Tile draw was also a factor, but again, knowing that now, i'd have made different choices. 

We all enjoyed the game a lot, very interesting, and would happily play again. nice production, good thick tiles, slightly over-sized board. 

I got my copy from Milan Spiele for only 12€, bargain!

*** Played again, one new player, very quick to set up, explain and play. game-play was only about 30 mins. Very enjoyable, not so much blocking and much more competition for livestock meant a very close finish, I just squeeked out a win. Top game, really enjoyed it.

RATING: 4
A little bit of dominoes (double-square tile placement), a little bit of Java/Taluva (using those tiles to build over other tiles), a little bit of Ingenious (placement of a tile triggers scoring of all other connected tiles).

:star::star::nostar::nostar::nostar: - 1st play

It's simple, streamlined, and - to my tastes - bland. No mechanical complaints about the game, and it's a good lightweight game to play with families. Farm theme helps. But the graphics, while sharp and tidy, are sober and decorative rather than fun and interesting. The market for this game probably wants cuter graphics.

A great looking farm game, with some really interesting ways to score your points. Do you score now or use your points, to move up in the barn and try to score those points later? The domino looking tiles look great and are nice and thick and work really well, with the game. Game play moves pretty quickly, with very little down time in between players, but some players may suffer a little AP, as the game board gets filled up, with more choices.

I think the game would be good for familys and gamers alike. Check it out. I'm glad that I did.

A family-weight tactical tile game that reminds me of Hanging Gardens and Carcassonne.  And that's the problem . . . I'd really rather be playing either of those alternatives.  I'm also not thrilled that the game often requires someone to "take one for the team" in order to rein in a leader.

Quite enjoyable tile-laying game: each tile gives you the possibility to score immediately some points, or to move up a track that may eventually generate more points later in the game. Most decision taking in the game comes from this simple dilemma.

While the decisions are important, they are not terribly taxing.   There will often be some indecision as a player decides how best to use these points, but isn’t something that causes significant tension or angst.  The game contains just enough decisions and options to hold the interest of most gamers, and seems well suited as a fine family game.  That is a good combination.

The game doesn't work with 5 players, due to the lack of tiles... You will only have 15 turns (or 14), and to reach the first "farm" you will spend at least 5 of them (33%). So, it doesn'n worth to spend time on the markets... If they were not there the game would be the same (or better, because players who invest on them loose for sure). With 4 the game is much better, because of the challenging on the markets. Anyway it's light to play and it has some fun.

Simple and quick-playing tile-laying game. Each turn you much choose, usually twice, whether to score points in one of two ways. The first way grants immediate points; the second way has the potential to yield greater benefits, but it's risky and there's a race aspect to that path. Just a solid game with simple rules but tough choices each turn.

This is a winner if you like fast-playing, strategic, interactive euros with minimalist mechanics that leads to emergent gameplay. Virtues include

- easy to teach (< 10 minutes)
- plays quickly (< 1 hour)
- no downtime (turns take a few seconds)
- appears to scale well (liked it with 2 and 4)
- interactive (no multi-player solitaire)
- lots of creative ways to approach the game (many paths to victory)
- good tension in each turn (score points, try to get barns, work for animal bonuses, stop other players, chip away at points or work for big scores)

This is a tile-laying game where you build up fields of different crops. The tiles stack, so there is an interesting 3D puzzle aspect. When you play a tile you have a bunch of choices in why you might play them, or what benefits to obtain: score points, work toward bonuses, try to block other players, create situations benefiting future plays, and more. A lot of tradeoffs.

I learned about this from a Dice Tower review, and stumbled over a copy in a local store. So glad I picked this up. It's OOP and hard to find, especially in North America. 

It does look boring. The theme, the box, the components are all meh.

The gameplay is good. It's also deceptive. It seems like a casual, lightweight game. It's actually surprisingly cutthroat and with a lot of tension. A keeper.

I really enjoyed my first play of this game.  Simple games with simple rules but considerable thought in game play is something I really appreciate (IE - Blokus & Gypsy King).  One plays a rectangular tile on the common farm and stakes out a claim - choosing either to score points for the field and/or choosing to raise their barn building value.  Get a barn out and claim a field gives you points that you score for that field every turn although others will seeking to make your field smaller.  Finally - and most interestingly, the field will build up into multidimensional as you can stack tiles on top of other tiles - this can lead to clever game play which makes covering up an opponent's barn field difficult since it is multi layered!  Rules are easy to explain and play.

I think my biggest fear about this game is not luck of the tile draw (which can effect people poorly), but more that once people are all up to speed on how to play well, I could see victory being determined only by who was the luckiest in drawing the right animal...

Didn't really work with 5 players. Adding to the 'big fields' (if a player was able to) was far more attractive then advancing on the 'barn-track'. (In fact I wasn't able to add and it turned out that the 12-15 points you might get in the end don't make up for the 20 something points scored in a single turn for the big fields that showed up).

Also too few tiles for five players to make a 'long term strategy' worthwile.

Upgraded to '5' after playing with 3. Playing with fewer people adds a bit more control, but still nothing special.

09/21/13 Played a three-player game in 65 minutes. 
I don't get the theme. If players are separate farmers, how/why are they allowed to overplant a neighbor's property/field? Are they living on a commune? If so, why do they try to screw each other over? They should have left it an abstract (like Ingenious, which it resembles quite lot). As to the components, why does each player's "100" tile not have "200" on the other side? Our winner today reached 244 points. 
I liked that Heartland had a strategic option - the barnyard (even though I didn't use it today). I did get the impression one should either go tactical or strategic, that trying to split the difference was the worst of both worlds. I've played many tile laying games, but this one seemed different enough I'd be happy to play it again. I rated it a "6". Though that could change as I saw what seemed like some very valid points posted here as to why it doesn't work well with a full compliment of five.

Enjoyable and relatively quick (45-60 min) tile-laying game.  Place tiles and then score the points for all adjacent like crop-tiles on the board.  The trick is that the points scored can either be on the VP or development track.  You score twice for each tile as they each have two parts (like a domino).  Once you reach appropriate levels on the development track you can build a farmhouse which will continue to score at the end of each your turns.  This is an important way to garner additional points -- your opponents will try to split up your croplands (by placing tiles atop them) but there are some neat placement strategies to help reduce or decentivize attacks.

Pretty great.  Wife really enjoys it too which is a huge plus.  I see this working its way into our 2-player rotation alongside TTR: Nordic, Biblios, and Jaipur. 

Feels well balanced and well playtested.  Multiple paths to gain victory points - go the instant gratification route in the fields or take the longer barn/livestock route - and a mixing of these paths seems like a viable option too.  Games have been close - yet to see someone run away with it - though only played with two up to this point.

Theme has already been discussed.  Biggest challenge will be getting it to the table, but excited to introduce to more folks.

On a first play, the 3 of us were intrigued enough by the two different scoring choices that we immediately played again, in an attempt to suss out optimal strategies. This hardly ever happens with new games. Part of this was a desire to "solve" the game, and our conclusion was, the solution depends

Bizarre domino-stacking exercise which seems to pretty much defy common sense and logic with rules that shouldn't really work at all, so it's a pleasant surprise when they do. The bloke on the front is hilarious.

Take Taluva, Hanging Gardens and just a dash of Santiago and you get this. Nothing particularly original, but an extremely well put together game that makes an ideal "next step" for those who have discovered gaming via the usual array of gateway games, but aren't quite ready for "Through the Ages", "Age of Steam" or "Die Macher"!!

I like it.

I like the gameplay. It is easy, works well, feels correct.
But a serious game should not have a luckfactor like the cows, pigs and chickens. 
Better should be: first one to come, first one to choose a cow. Why should you work hard to get a cow, if someone else can take a better later on?

Wow! I didn't see this one coming around the corner. Bought on sale at a very low cost and thought it would be just another one of those tile placement-games but it's really good. Even though it's abstract it captures the feel of competitive farming (like that was a real thing, ey?). It's fast (about 20-30 minutes) and there's always a couple of things you would like to do even though you can only do one thing. Very, very nice indeed.

This is a punchy euro farming game. 

In this game you lay tiles and score points based on contiguity of icons on either side of the tile. There are two different ways to score. One lets you get points, the other lets you increase on the matching tech track. When you reach a certain threshold, you can place a barn token which claims an area just for you, which will pay out for you in points at the end of each turn. The trick to this is other players can still lay dissimilar tiles across your field to shrink or cut it up so it becomes worse for you over time. Players who reach the end of the tech tracks also get bonus points of decreasing value for players who arrive in those spots later.

Good game, lots of interaction. Can definitely suffer from tile draw luck and players not acting in their own best interests. After a few plays, this game came down to 'like, but don't love' for me. Not a bad game by any means, but I don't feel compelled to keep it around forever.

:star: Art, Iconography and components functional

A clever tile-laying game that feels a bit like 3-dimensional dominoes. It does feel more like an abstract than a farming game though, and I really disliked the randomness of the animal tile rewards. If I play this again, it will be with the variant suggested by the designer where the first to get a cow gets the best one and so on.

This is a more obscure game, but it is really quite good.  It is relatively abstracted tile laying game, that is really simple to teach.  It offers a couple of different angles on how to score each tile placement, that opens up a lot of variation in your available strategies to win.  The game play is fast and very tactical.  There is no multiplayer solitaire here.  The play is very interactive between everyone, but is still doesn't feel overly vicious.

RATING: 7.5
Nice tile-laying, farming themed game. 
Two ways of scoring; points for field/crop size or score barn points. Larger crop areas give you more points but also allow your opponents to cash in on its size later. By scoring enough barn points you can claim them with your barns to secure them for extra points but this makes you a target for dividing up your field.
Good family game or light/medium fare for gamers.

You add a field and try to score points for it. Nice idea, but just waaaay too dependent on luck -- if you don't get the right card to attach to that huge region of one vegetable that the other players just built up, then you simply won't get the 20 points that each of them just earned. Also, you might never get the right cards for building your second farm.

Very cute domino game.  Flower Power meets Java. It has a very nice progression of strategy and tactics from early to mid and late game.  Lots of stuff to do, with a number of rewarding choices.  

It works with 5 but it may be pushed to the limit.  I don't think that there is a runaway leader problem, but I do think it is a little tough for someone trailing to catch up. I'd like to see it with 3 or 4, it seems that a smaller player count will lead to more options, and fewer big opportunities getting splashed around for some and not for others. 

UPDATE: I think it is worse with 4.  The upgrade grid is expanded so players are much more reliant on random tile draws.  The luck can be mitigated with the special tiles in the 5 player game, with four, if you can't get enough of a resource in a random draw, you just never will be able to get a 2nd barn.  Is the solution one face up tile available, or to play the 4 player game on the 5 player matrix, or both...  

I still like the game, but it just sucks when the tiles don't go your way.

Interesting tile-laying game. Tiles may be used to either score VP immediately or advance 1 of 5 tracks upward. Getting tracks up evenly allows placement of 2 barns, which score VP every turn. Advancing tracks to end scores semi-random VP, with higher values awarded to earlier players. 

Luck of the tile draw, but mitigated by hand size of 3 and by 5 special tiles players begin game with. Also plays pretty quickly.

Good family game. I've only played it with 2 players and so I have to try it with more. This is a preliminary rating. The components are very good and the time of play/flow is excelent. Could work very well with more players.

Played with 3 players
I prefer the 2 player version. It's more balanced and gives you a more intense strategic feeling although also based on luck. Timing is everything and some things we just learn them with experience which makes this one a good choice.

great quality components

RATING: 7
This is a tactical tile-laying game with what appears to be a relatively short half-life,  although, the theme and play-process fit very well together. But it is hampered by by what can be severe luck issues.  There is no way to compensate for poor luck when drawing tiles since you can be screwed out of both climbing the farm track, as well as on-board scoring.  Because the farm track is so granular, even if you choose to focus on it,if your tile draws suddenly don't support it--by which I mean your chosen farm track only gets single farm points while your competition can pass you up in two turns with double farm scoring tiles.

The choice to climb the farm track is not really a choice it assures you both end of every round farm points as well as puts you closer to livestock tiles--both of which add too MANY more points than you can gain by immediate scoring. 

Over the course of the game, even small farms will earn more than the best scoring anyone else might attempt instead of pursuing farms.  When added to the fact that it also pushes you closer to the livestock tokens, there is really only a single viable strategy, at least at the start of the game.

Tile-laying Euro with an agricultural theme. Players have to place tiles of different types of crops onto the board making sure that they adhere to a 'crop-rotation' policy i.e. that a crop cannot be placed on top of a crop of the same type. The player is then faced with a choice of acquiring victory points, depending on how many adjacent tiles of the same crop there are, or farming points, which allows a player to place a farm on the board thereby claiming ownership of a group of tiles, and eventually leads to the acquisition of livestock that provide further victory points. Overall 'Heartland' is an engaging game which requires some considerable thought when trying to maximise your tile placement and there's opportunities for a lot of indirect conflict as you place tiles on opponents' fields making them smaller which is probably the most fun aspect of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
tl;dr: solid

This game does a lot with very few rules. Every tile you place gives you so many options. Where do you place it, what side of the tile do you score what way? Do you go for the barn points or just for regular straight up points?
There's also a bit of an [thing=9674][/thing] thing going on where everyone wants to score that big area on their turn (if they can) until it looses it's value and everyone moves on to the next points bonanza.
It can be quite aggressive at times, but this is not a game you win by just blocking others. Most of all you have to make sure you are scoring points.

Reminds me of Ingenious, but with farming. The extra complication of balancing the race for barns versus points is interesting, but perhaps not enough to make it too much different from the basic strategies of Ingenious. A bit too straightforward overall for my tastes, it suffers from the problem of luck of the draw and a limited ability to impede your opponents. Another play may see me drop this to a 4; at best, I would speculate that it will remain a 6.

A very nice tile-laying game obviously inspired by Einfach Genial and having a theme added. The theme is really, really, pasted on though...

Also it is crucial to play with the rule about NO player, including the barn owner, scoring a barn-ed field. Otherwise luck of the draw becomes too important. Luck is already important -- the double-fields are quite powerful.

This is the type of game that will stay in my collection for a long time, perhaps likely forever. The design hits all the right notes for me and this medium light game can be compared to other heavyweights in its category such as Samurai, Through the Desert and Ticket to Ride.

The rule set is simple and intuitive, thus easy to grasp by most players. However, there is depth to decision making as one has to decide on placement of tiles and the divergence in scoring. The main tension of the game comes from deciding whether to grab victory points from scoring, or to sacrifice immediate gratification for long term planning in the form of farm points. Farm points allow permanent scoring each and every turn but requires a farm that can only be obtained from their respective farm tracks. The pace is quick with only an occasional slow down as players assess the board for tile placement. The rules while simple, could also be slightly better organized and written.

Heartland was never released globally and certainly never made it over to the US. That is unfortunate. I hope that this Allers design will be picked up by a smaller publisher and re-released to a wider audience that it deserves.

One play, Essen 2009.  Reminded me of Taluva.  Another even more abstract game that comes to mind is Einfach Genial, in that areas you extend for points may, without clever placement, be extended by the next player for slightly more points, while there is incentive to score during the game from all area types.

Not the best game that I've played recently, but it does play very quickly.  I'll definitely be playing it again, just because of how quickly it plays.  

The amount of luck is a little bit too much for me (the doubles are too powerful, in my opinion, and if you can't get the last veggie that you need for a farm, then there's not much you can do about it), but I'll give it a pass because it plays quickly.

Отличная плиточная игра. Хорошо продуман геймплей, есть несколько простых приятных нюансов.
Идеально написан и исполнен рулбук.
Не уверен, что хорошо играть впятером. Сильно изменяется картина к следующему ходу (стратегия становится более сиюминутной). К тому же даунтайм.
В мультике от кингмейкинга немного спасают закрытые призовые тайлы с животными с тайным количеством очков.
Втроем сыграли. Счет каждого перевалил за полторы сотни, при этом я отстал от победителя на 4 очка (практически 1 протупленный ход решил). Третье место еще в нескольких очках. Хороший баланс между приоритетными путями развития.

When looking at the box, you might think this is a game that was published in the early 90’s of the 20th century. The artwork of the box, and the size and shape of the box are from that time. But the game is only 4 years old. Maybe the looks have something to do, that most stores have this, simple tile-laying game on stock. A shame, because it’s a fun family-game. Easy to explain, easy to pick-up while playing, and some strategy inside.

On a players turn, he gets 3 crop-tiles. He places one of them on the board, creating fields of the same kind of crops. Now he can get victorypoints, for the size of the fields he created. Or, and this is where it becomes interesting, he can choose farmpoints. On the crop-tiles are little markers (0, 1 or 2) placed in the corners. If he chooses the farmpoints, he moves up for one of the five kind of crops on the (seperate) farmpoints track. If all markers have passed a certain point, the player can build a farm on the board, which will give him free victory points every turn. At the end of his turn, he fills up his hand to three tiles.

As said, the choice between the different kind of points makes this game interesting. At the end of the game, only the victorypoints matters, but the farms can give you lot of victorypoints every turn.

A fun family game, that could be more known, if the design would fitted these days. For example in a box like the Alea big-box series.

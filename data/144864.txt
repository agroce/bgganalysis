RANK: 1290

RATING: 6
The new mechanics and card effects are not an improvement. They lack the simplicity and elegance of the original ones.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
*Rating based on iOS app.

This expansion introduces Dark Energy Shards, which provide energy like the shards in Rise of Vigil, but when they enter the center row, they allow all players to banish a card from their discard pile, which I like.  I tend to favor deck thinning strategies, so having this easy way to do it is something I like.

This set also introduces the ability to transform cards into other, more powerful cards.  This is a fun ability in the iOS version, but I could see it being a bit of a pain in the tabletop game.

I like Darkness Unleashed as much as I like Rise of Vigil, maybe even a little more because of the Dark Energy Shard banish ability, but my same gripe remains: it can be too random when the shards come out.  If you have and enjoy Rise of Vigil, this one is a must buy to me.

General thoughts on Ascension: I generally like the game, having the right level for complexity for what it is. It's definitely better with a low player count, as with five or six players (which you can play with only by combining two sets) the downtime gets a bit too much and the center line changes too much after your turn to really care about what is there. Combining sets is also problematic, as it make the deck unshufflable. If I were to ever buy a copy of Ascension, I probably get only set and player as a two-player game.

Decent set with great theme and Sabee art! I enjoy the transform cards quite a bit.

I only play this set with Rise of vigil, as the energy mechanic is too insular (IMO) to be mixed with the previous 2 blocks.

RATING: 6
Ascension was a fun game, but not for long. There are some interesting mechanics, but if I'm up for a deck builder, there always seem to be better options to bring to the table. Still, we got quite a lot of play out of it. Not a bad game, just better examples out there, imo.

This ascension set continues with the treasures/energy but introduces the new transform mechanism. Transform is exactly as it sounds... the card turns into a new card (which is a more powerful version of the previous card).  Conveniently, you have a choice of dual-sided cards (ideal if you use opaque-backed sleeves) or a separate cards for transformed and non-transformed versions. To transform cards in this set, you will typically need to meet the energy thresholds (See Rise of Vigil comments). This also introduces Dark Energy Shards, which are like the normal shards, except they have a Fate effect of allowing people to banish a card in their discard pile.  I like additional effects that allow you to cull your deck. Overall, this is a good addition to Rise of Vigil set.

The dark shards do a great job of speeding up gameplay, which actually is quite helpful with the extremely swingy nature of this block. It plays extremely well on its own, and the transform cards are a very welcome addition to this game system.

RATING: 6
The transform mechanic is very interesting, generally with a certain amount of energy creatures transform and become better suped up versions of themselves.

The smaller creatures (2-3) military are nice and I do enjoy the energy shards allowing the drawing of more cards.

[size=7]Sad trombone note:  The expansion cards aren't quite the same size as the [i]Rise of Vigil[/i] cards, making riffle shuffling rough, and the cards sort by size when overhand shuffled.  (And no, "pile shuffling" isn't actually shuffling (randomization)—it's more properly "pile [i]sorting[/i]".)  This would be easily solved with sleeves, if only I used them.  Bummer.[/size]

Singular function cards(Apprentice/Mystic & Militia/Heavy Infantry) combined with the randomly generated center row create too many turns where your strategy did not match up with probabilities, and can lead to a snowball problem.

I could be convinced to play a two-player game only. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
It seems it's the essential supplement to Rise of Vigil. It gives many more possibilities to thin out your deck.  These abilities are too scarce in RoV itself.  Therefore RoV and DU should always be played together.

The new transform mechanics is just ok.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (September 2014)

Along Rise of Vigil, Darkness Unleashed is among my favorite Ascension sets. The “energy” and “transform” mechanisms are very fun to play. On the bad side the energy cards can make the game and turns a lot longer for such a simple game so it is best as a two player game. I won’t mix more sets to add players because it would add lots of downtime and the energy cards would get diluted, thus, a lot less effective.

Love the art.

The decisions are (mostly) obvious and the game is tactical in nature. In general I dislike deckbuilding games that have a variable market offering (as does this one)because they are not fair to all the players, so the luck factor is very high. Due to this I cannot give a high rating to this game nor I would ever buy it. Dominion is still king for me in this category. 

Bottom line, Darkness Unleashed is among the best Ascension sets I have ever played, however, it isn’t enough for me to buy it due to the high luck factor, it has lots of uncontrollable luck (pure tactics). A good expansion to have if you are a fan of the series (which I’m not).

This is a good continuation of the Rise of Vigil large set.  I love the addition of Dark Energy Shards to add a bit more banishing (read: hand management) to the game).  The transform cards are pretty cool, too, and there aren't too many of them, so it's still manageable.  

I think this will play better when combined with Rise of Vigil than on its own, though.

I really like what this expansion adds to the Rise of Vigil. It's exactly what an expansion should be: a cool, new bonus feature, plus a few extra normal for the base game without too much added complexity.. I wouldn't go so far as to call this expansion *required* (because I think Rise of Vigil can stand on it's own just fine), but it is really cool, and I certainly won't be playing without it.

RATING: 7
A great expansion that introduces a new resource and another big moment to the game. It does however not work great with other expansions as the new resource becomes too rare and luck-dependant. I would recommend playing this expansion with Rise of Vigil and those decks alone. Possibly including Realms Unraveled for some extra spice.

RATING: 8
A nice little set for two players. Bought as an expansion for RoV we anyhow gave it a spin and really enjoyed the new cards. Maybe not a practical place to start with Ascension since one has to know the basic rules or get them online.

After more plays I would not recommend this as two-player game. It appears to lack a sufficient number of basic buildup cards. Looking forward to trying it with Rise of Vigil.

Mixed into Rise of Vigil so I have no idea what cards this added unless I start paying attention to the icons in the bottom. I really like the transform cards though and the dark energy is neat. I'd have to say if I sleeved this game the pile would be ridiculously large. I don't plan on it, but it may happen in the future.

The new artwork for the Mystics, Heavy Infantry, etc is awesome. I really wish they updated the cultist art though.

Jen really likes this game, more so than the others. I'm undecided on it just because of how swingy the energy feels. It is fun, just not sure how strategic it is anymore.

Edit: See Rise of Vigil. This set is growing on me, but so far it's the lowest rated one and one that if I hadn't bought before, it'd be the only set I didn't buy.

I have played [thing=69789][/thing] only once, but I enjoy the game for what it is. I understand where it's success comes from. And the need for more expansions.
I got to play two of them together for the first time, so it's hard to say things about them individually.
Again, I enjoyed this game. There is luck with what cards come out and what not, but for the most part that doesn't bother me. It's part of the game. The Darkness Unleashed expansion (I think) adds energy cards. These are a nice concept, but they add more luck to the game. More often than not, you have cards that need energy, but no energy, or lots of energy, and no cards that need any. For that reason I give this stand-alone expansion a lower score.

This does improve upon Rise of Vigil with the transformed cards, so I would recommend adding this in regularly when playing Rise of Vigil.
The center deck is HUGE and requires a lot of shuffling and splitting up to put back in their respective boxes, but at least you will almost certainly never run out of cards to put in the center row unlike in Godslayer where I've run out of cards in the center deck a few times.

This is my favorite expansion so far to Ascension.  I like the dark energy mechanic that allows you to send a card to the void when they come out and that helps me tweak the power my deck as I play.  The transform cards are a good add-on as well but it is really easy to transform them in DU because they are all based off of Energy.  Realms Unraveled is a bit more challenging to get the cards transformed and I like that.

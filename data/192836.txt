RATING: 7
In the arena of logistics/resource conversion games, this is the closest contender to Ora & Labora for what I'm looking for that I've played (compared to Neuland, Roads & Boats, and Le Havre). First off, this has an almost dizzying decision tree in how wide it is with the various pathways, jumps, chaining of your three turns, etc. You can do just about anything you want and baring a couple of chokepoints (I think the CommunityHall being one), you can sort of do what you want and see how it works out. One thing that this does over R&B is it's not passive-aggressive in it's confrontation (e.g. gold isn't sitting on donkeys for ownership). In that respect, where R&B is logistics, O&L settlement spatial & resource conversions, it feels like The Colonists chooses instead to focus on the central map and connections that you want to make (in an optimized manner). Where Ora & Labora shine for me as a 3 (or, with experienced players, 4p) game due to work contracts, this seems to have a linear play time based on players and works rather well as a 1 and 2p game. One thing I do appreciate in The Colonists over O&L is the variability in when buildings come out within the era (as in O&L, you can pick up the same building on your first turn if you plan well).

That said, there are a couple things that annoy me about the game. It runs long, period. This is a game that would jump 2 points in my rating scheme if you could play a 3 era game in 3 hours or less (basically, the time frame of O&L). In 3 games, I'm still averaging a little under 90min per era when it feels like the game should realistically only consume 60 or less per. It overstays it's welcome in that regard. The era skipping feature is neat, but it almost takes as much time to skip the first era as it does to play it... Second, there isn't much driving diversification of strategy outside when buildings come out. Why would I not try and create a brewery district late in the game or skip theaters/casinos? (sure, there is a reason, but my point of "if you don't know how to leverage that, there is nothing pushing you toward finding out"). That's a by product of having such a wide open playing field, and some players who are more likely to latch onto a strategy and avoid trying something else will be disappointed. This is a game that requires "self-starter" gamers. I do think having a set of challenges (e.g. "have the most glitzy entertainment district for an additional 10pts per building" would have been neat as an alternate pathway to victory or variance). Last, the lack of interaction relegates this to a 2p game at most, it's surprising what a work contract in O&L can do to create a pleasant euro-style interaction aspect.

Overall, I'm rather happy with the game and looking forward to seeing what Puls and company do with expansions. A strong 7.

RATING: 6
1 play / 4 players (1 & 2nd era)

LIKE: I like how little engines are made in small areas on the map. To do this players need to discover the different combos. The embassy powers are pretty interesting and work well. I liked building on personal boards.

DISLIKE: Fiddly, chit intensive. Tiny icons on the map tiles are difficult to read. Mostly multi-player solitaire. What a player's goal should be was not clear the first time through.

OVERALL: I felt the first era could be skipped. It possibly could lead to some alternate strategy setups, but random pre-setup cards could do the same thing. I think the game is similar to Rosenberg's games, but less tight. Probably too slow of a game for me.

Small comparisons to Istanbul.

Fantastic city building/civilisation game.  Nowhere near as heavy as it appears, this game is really easy to pick up and understand but has a lot of strategy once you get into the 3rd and 4th eras.

Very relaxing game to play solo.  You can immerse yourself for 4-5 hours playing the full 4-era game and enjoy the puzzle of laying out the city tiles and trying to get the optimal routes for your colonist(s) to generate the most useful tiles for your town.

The fact that the rules give you advice on how to start in later eras is good and there are some great files on BGG to let you record the full state of the board if you want to pack it away and resume play another day.

RATING: 4.5
A game that starts well and it is impressive just be the shear number of components. As the game progresses, it becomes too fiddly and less fun, ending up way too long for what it has to offer. While great games generate complexity and decision through smart mechanics, Colonists does that just be number of components.

A monster-development-game, which requires to be familiar with it in order to finally enjoy it.

After 4-5 plays it seems that development is an end in itself, which does not make me enthusiastic about it.

RATING: 6
Decent, well designed euro wherein players move their steward (worker) on a variable hex board, with each hex allowing you to take an action, such that you acquire resources and build buildings that give you victory points on your player board.  Different hex/action arrangements and buildings make for some replay-ability, and presumably, multiple paths to victory.  

That said, there is not much here that is not in essential every such similar euro.  (See, for example, Agricola, Caverna or Ora Labora).  Accordingly, for euro gamers looking for something new, or particularly interesting, there is not much here.  True, this game can provide for a particularly lengthy standard euro game.

Nice thick card components and graphics.  Box advertised worker movement as an evolution from worker placement.  Albeit it is simply restricted worker placement.  Mechanism fine but tile lay out crucial.  First game, admittedly as newbie, I had no wood, could not get wood and could not move to any other location except the base tile without having wood.  Effectively lost three turns, momentum and any chance of being competitive.  Each player gets three turns together.  Allows for combinations but painfully slow.  Especially as one tile enable players to get and select cards, which they then need to read and then decide which ones to keep.  You can plan ahead to an extent, but quite often moves scuppered as you need to use a tile another player is occupying which requires additional costs.  The changing benefits of the home tiles and the board evolution worked well.  But the game was way too slow and offered very little in the way of new ideas or mechanics.

Volumenében meg a kellékek mennyiségében nekem néhány Uwe játékot idézett (Ora et Labora pl.), a mászkálós rész meg a Keyflowert, de ez a játék nagyon letisztult, a hosszú szabály ellenére sem érzem agyonbonyolítottnak. Fix 3 akció, a lépések a "térképen" a világ legegyszerűbb módján történnek, a kombózás mégis nagyon méllyé teszi. Ami tetszett, az a követségi rész, ami a random követségek miatt teljesen egyedivé teszi az egyes partikat (pl. egyik partiban könnyebb lesz nagyobb raktárt szerezni, a másikban az emberek színében kapunk segítséget stb.). A másik ami jó, hogy éreztem a játékban a fejlődést. Mi sajnos csak az első 2 kort játszottuk le, de a végén már éreztem, hogy a 3. korra muszáj lenne a sárga emberekre rágyúrni, és más szempontból is teljesen átjött a fejlődés, pl. ahogy az új épületek sorra jönnek be. A piac megoldása nagyon elegáns, biztosítja a változatosságot és hogy sose álljon be a játék. Szerintem 2-3 parti után egy teljes játék lemegy 2-3 óra/játékos alatt. 
Összességében ritka jó játéknak érzem, csupán az tart vissza a 9-10-es pontszámtól, hogy még csak fél partin vagyok túl. Nem is tudok így hirtelen hibáját mondani, talán csak a hosszú előkészület meg a nagy játékidő. A hossza meg a nagy játékdömping miatt megeshet, hogy nem is játszom már vele soha, pedig erre még talán rászánnék egyszer egy teljes napot is. Mindenkinek ajánlom, aki az összetettebb gazdálkodósakat szereti, azokból az egyik legjobb. Legalább az Uwe-féle gazdálkodósok szintjén van nekem.

RATING: 7
A good game that takes some time for the strategies to start come into play. Towards the end of Era 2 you will suddenly see the importance of placing the Tiles and will feel punished for what you did in the first two Eras.

It's a bit of setup work even if you are organised (10 minutes), putting everything back into the box is the worst part (about 15 minutes). Using the "save game" feature will certainly add to it but I haven't tried it, yet.

However, it is a pretty good game. Be prepared to sacrifices a lot of table space. 

The real downside for me comes with the component quality. It is already in the higher price range but the Cards really are subpar standard, the Box itself feels really cheap. The Tiles (which there are plenty) are of good quality and so are the player boards. All player tokens are of acceptable quality.

If only Stonemaier Games could have produced this game!!

Did I regret the purchase ? Certainly not!! If you are looking for a Civilisation Building Game and don't mind longer gameplay than this is for you.

Plays great solo and with 2 people. I would not recommend pushing the player count past 3.

Initial Impression: There are a TON of components in this game, with thick cardboard used for the chunky tiles. I find the graphic design for the components are above average but nothing too stellar, as the component's size limited the amount of room the designer had to put all relevant info on. As a result, my poor aging eyes had a difficult time seeing some of the iconography. This game is an interesting mix of engine building, vp optimization, with a spacial puzzle thrown into the mix. The main board grows at the end of every round, presenting the players with new  possibilities. Imagine a worker placement game where new worker spaces open up as the game progresses. There are a fair amount of resources which can be converted to other resources but somehow this doesn't feel as overwhelming as most Rosenberg games. Overall the game has a light feeling to it, with few calculations to be performed, but the decisions have a long term impact on the players' performance in the game. And by long term, I mean LONG. This game can be played through 4 phases or "eras". Your production decisions in one era will directly affect your performance in the next. There's a wonderful need to balance the short and long term gains. Personally, I believe the game is probably best experienced as a 4 era game since the sense of your colony's progression is so strong in this game.

RATING: 7
I like the way it is played, the possibilities are huge, components and artwork are great, but the game is too long to become a topgame. In fact you do 10 hours or more the same thing. On the otherhand, playing only two era's gives the game a feeling of uncompleteness. Also two minor points : you can get easily cards, but it is hard to play a card (only one place if the right colony isn't in the game) and why the choice of doing 3 actions in a row : for that reason, there's a lot of downtime especially when one of your actions is taking cards.

I played 1 game - we got about 1/3 through starting by 8 and played 2.5 hours or so.  Really enjoyed it, lots of fun.  If this could be played on Yucata or Board Game Arena it would be a perfect fit for me.  Full of interesting choices, good spacial element, hugely satisfying.  I will never play a full game of this probably as I cannot really cope with the full length and not sure I have people who want want to play it over several sittings with me.  There are rules for shortened versions and I am not sure how they would work but the game itself is so much fun, lots of interesting choices whilst at the same time being fairly simple to begin with.

Really well designed although the full game is a bit long for my tastes.  Lots of different ways to play and lots of variability baked in so I can see this being a game that can just be played and played.

Brian and I played this and only this for our Friday game night. Brian won 237-231 but got about 25-30 extra points due to a rule error we both had about how to raze and change out buildings. 

I enjoyed this and would play it again, but only ever at 2-player. Our game took, after set-up (40 minutes) and going through the rules together (1 hour) about 3 and a half hours. We played the full 4 era game. It takes the basic of Euro design (upgrade workers, upgrade goods, goods are VP at end of game, etc.) and ramps up the time it takes to do these things. This works to it's detriment as it literally takes you an hour to start getting your engine going. 

There were things I liked about the game. I enjoyed the tile placement each round. The start player (which stays the same unless you take an action to change it) connects 3 tiles at the end of a round which were revealed at the beginning of the round. You can set up chains of useful tiles for yourself. I also liked the improvement cards. They added end game scoring, cheaper build actions and more but didn't seem game breaking like a lot of card decks I see in other Euro games. I also really liked the Guilds in the game. 4 come out in the beginning and you can earn prestige within each one which grants additional special abilities. Brian went heavy in the Trader's Guild, while I upgraded my Lords guild, which let me take any good I wanted instead of a tile action when I moved.

Things I didn't like: STORAGE!!! The game forces you into a jam with storing your goods. Luckily for us, we also had the Storekeeper guild which adds storage to your board as you gain prestige with them. Some of the later buildings require 8 or 9 goods to build so you will need to get at least 2-3 storage upgrades throughout the game. Also, I wasn't a big fan of the rules about moving goods. It seemed contrived to me. You can only move goods before actions and only to certain areas of your board. Weird. I also wasn't a fan of the extremely complicated rules for upgrading and razing buildings. As I mentioned earlier, that was a big deal for Brian in our game. Essentially, you have to have a worker on the building (so not anywhere else working for you) to raze it or upgrade it. And you can only move workers back to the buildings at the end of a year. Brian's whole strategy revolved around upgrading his buildings to money making ones and this was problematic for him as well. This could have been done more elegantly. 

So in the end, I think I will hold onto this for now but I think I will end up trading or selling it at some point.

The Colonists is basically an engine building, resource conversion game where landing where your opponent is costs you resources. You are following a progression of conversions of buildings and workers that lead you to the upper echelon of  buildings and workers that provide you with bigger points. Mechanically, it is not a difficult game to get, but the planning and foresight leaves a lot of food for thought and the plethora of options can leave you bewildered.

This is a game that I would rate a bit higher if it wasn't for the length of the game when played at four eras. It seems that you want to play the four eras to get the complete picture and full scope. Four players is probably not the right player count because of length, but it might be a bit more of a loose game at less.

 The game has some similarities with the resource conversions of Roads and Boats, but somehow this game felt a little longer. Still, with the right group and with plenty of time, it is an intriguing and challenging puzzle worth exploring if just for the fun of trying to find the different paths and avenues to victory.

RATING: 8
Incredibly vast game. After several plays, I really enjoy the game and expect to play it at least a few times each year. If it wasn't such an incredible time commitment I would play it more, but I'm still happy with how often I plan to play. Expect to spend about 2 hours per player for a full game, perhaps a bit longer. Watching your village grow and expand over the game's 120+ actions is quite impressive. I love that your village's demands for goods, or storage, or tools, or workers, or food will be constantly shifting over the course of the game - not because the game forces a demand onto you, but because your hopes for the development of your village bring up different needs.

Pros:
* Incredible engine builder.
* Every game will play at least somewhat differently due to map construction, card draws, and colonies available.
* Shifting goals/focus throughout the game (I need storage! No I need citizens! No, I need food! No wait I forgot points!)
* Very thought-intensive game, which I consider a pro. If you enjoy puzzling through problems, this game will keep your brain busy for hours.
* Appears to have room for different strategies.
* Plays well solo.

Cons:
* Incredible length of the game means I will certainly have to turn it down sometimes simply because of time. I'm not opposed to long games by any means, it just means I can't say I will "never" turn this down.
* I'm not fully convinced all strategies are equally viable. Or even "most" strategies.
* Similarly, some colonies are clearly worse than others.

Other:
* Game absolutely requires a storage solution. There are a ton of chits.

Mechanically this game is good. There is one insane problem; It is far to long. A could accept some error like this from a small publisher. Lookout should have been able to extract the good parts of this game and find the right playtime.
Essentially it is a City Building game, with ressource conversion. The ressource conversion is less complex than in Le Havre, or Ora et labora. The gameplay is overall tactical and less strategic. There are some random elements, but not a lot. 
This could be a very good game, but it is not worth a playtime of 4-5 hours.

Wow this game was made for me and I love it! The epic scope, the storage puzzle, the resource conversion, the spatial elements of action selection, and the powers of the colonies are all so wonderful! May not be the game for you if you crave loads of player interaction, don't like long play times, or must play with 4 players. 
It is like I said to the designer "I love the resource conversion puzzle in Roads & Boats, I really enjoy the occupation cards and building of my own board in Agricola, and love the variability that comes from the way buildings come out in Le Havre. Can you design me an epic game based on that?"....and this is what came of it. Since those 3 games are in my top 10 games of all time, I pretty much love this one :)

Resource conversion, engine building game where action blocking is changed to paying to take actions other players took first.  

Like 'Gric, better actions come out later.  And, even more than 'Gric, the game is primarily about building your own engine.  Everyone has their own board where they can build buildings to generate resources, storage, and a few special powers.  The catch is most of those buildings need to be activated by one of three types of workers so players need to build buildings for those workers as well.

The action selection on the main board (map) is neat.  Each player takes three actions in a row and only "blocks" the last one.  The catch is the actions need to spatially adjacent on a hex map (special powers increase the distance) and each round the start player decides here these action tiles are placed.  

The three variable aspects are cards (improvements), colonies (different special powers each game available to all players, and market cards (an extra space to get stuff or build something).  They will generate some inter-game variability but not sure if there's enough there or not.  None of them are super-powerful so they won't define games, just help players who use them.

The biggest negative is that planning is tough.  That means that each new player increases the play time by about 75%.  At 1 hour per era, a 4 player 4-era game could be REALLY long.  On the plus side, it's possible (and reasonable) to start in a later era.  

Currently my favorite heavy game of 2016

Un juego de gestión de recursos y colocación de trabajadores. Se va construyendo un tablero con hexágonos, cada uno de los cuales, va a permitir obtener recursos y transformar mercancías, para ir evolucionando.
Cada jugador tiene un tablero personal, en el que va construyendo edificios que le van a reportar puntos al final, y durante la partida, le van a permitir obtener ciertos beneficios, aunque para que estos se produzcan, tienen que estar activados con un granjero encima. Hay trabajadores de tres clases... y cada edificio exige un tipo de trabajador. 
Es interesante el sistema de almacenamiento de recursos.

Great Euro game. Extremely well done, lots of interesting choices. Long, but I didn't mind although towards the end felt a bit long. However there were 4 of us, with 3 being first-timers. We got to Era 3, no time to complete. Definitely look forward to playing again. While everything is very well done, it felt very familiar. Better, deeper layers of choices than say Yokohama (as there should be given its length), but Yokohama felt fresher with the assistants movement mechanic of your main worker. Very fun, which for me is a big compliment for a game this long.

Anachrony killed Caverna and Lords of Waterdeep.
But somehow there was a whole that Anachrony couldn't fill. Maybe it is the component-part.
A good old german boardgame has a special kind of artwork and (wooden) components...
Sounds strange, right? Buying a game because you miss certain components... That's almost like buying a Queen game because of the Cube Tower or Queen's Gambit because of the palace. Uhm...

Anachrony looks and feels really fancy. Next to this I want something more down to earth.
Doesn't really follow the path of slimming down the collection but, hey, I don't judge you either.

Colonists is what I missed.
A big, deep well filled with wooden bits and thick cardboard pieces.
Something that you have to play so often to achieve a decent amount of points...

I like it a lot.

The limited movement of your worker(s) and the ever changing board. Great.
Even for a short round of 30 minutes. Just play one or two of the earlier eras.

I enjoyed this, though it has frustrating elements. Nothing too complicated is involved but the increasingly complex combinations of options soon result in a situation where the best move or series of moves is beyond my ability to really grasp. Fortunately the bite size chunks of your moves help you wrestle with the ungraspable and there are nearly always a few good options to take - though lord help anyone trying to analyse which is the optimal move, or rather lord help everyone else they're playing with - the game is long enough without it. Experience will help I'm sure but I doubt it'll ever feel calculable. Still, it feels a bit unsatisfying in a game of this length to have to be restricted to tactical choices rather than having strategic options that can be pursued by newbies as well as veterans.

Visually, the graphics for the production buildings on the map tiles could be a lot clearer - there's no colour clues despite colour featuring on the larger tiles you put on your player board (which is of course right in front of you, where you can see it) - otherwise it's functional. The gameplay itself is a wee bit footery, particularly swapping production goods back and forward, which causes a bit of an issue with knocking over meeples and displacing tiles unless you're very careful, but nothing disastrous.  Anyone who likes cardboard bits will love this though - it out-splotters Splotter!

A real "epic" worker placement game. Nice graphics and the rules are straight forward, you only have to pay attention to the storage rules and especially where you move your purveyor, i.e. plan ahead. It is a long game if you want to play the whole 4 epochs but you can start also in a later epoch or just play one epoch.

There is a lot to love here. My concern is that as the eras progress you are basically doing the same thing again only with more resources to keep track of. Also, it is best in 3-4 era games, but it is difficult to find people to play that length. However, still an excellent title.

I quite liked the spatial action selection in the middle, though starting in a later age meant there were a lot of options to digest right off the bat. Structuring a game so that you can play any subset of ages is great, though.

But overall, it didn't grab me - partly because some of the more interesting action spaces required hanging around a single part of the action board, partly because of sheer physical fiddliness. I really don't mind loads of components, but something about the stacking and moving-around of tiny chits here was a little wearing. And it wasn't short, even with 2p.

I thought the game was "okay", but not great. Typical Euro where you gather resources, upgrade things and build things for points. Seems to be a focus of proper chaining of actions and storage of goods. Neither of which are particularly interesting. Can be a lot of AP since you're limited to where your pawn can move among the action spaces. Storage is very limited, and some weird restrictive rules about when you can upgrade your residences. The residences house your workers (not workers in the WP sense, but the ones you need to "man" your buildings and storages). 

Only played the intro game (without using the Embassies), and we played through the first 2 (of 4) eras. The embassies seem to offer rule-breaking bonuses and a different 4 are available each game, so there's some variety. 

I'm not too keen on setting it up and playing again, tbh. Just didn't scratch any particular gaming itch of mine, I suppose. There's not much player interaction; not even blocking of spaces, as you can always go to a market stall, and even if another pawn is on the space you need to go to, you can still go; you just have to pay a fee. One thing that was weird is that my opponent and I were swimming in tools the entire game, and a reread confirms we played by the correct rules.

Played through Era 1 in order to teach the game. About half way through the game the flow of the game was constant without a lot of looking at the rules. Both my wife and I made some stupid mistakes from lack of planning or just planning wrong. While close after 1 era, I can see how the mistakes and decisions start to multiply as the game goes on. Really liked the game play and want to start getting more plays of this one in.

Players take 3 interlinked actions on their turn which leads to min/max AP.

Maybe this could go up to a 7, but there is just so much to keep track of in terms of resources and which are in your shed and which are on your buildings.   And the 4 era game would take a long time to play.  We played just 2 eras and it was a very lengthy game.  I'd be willing to play again and the rating could go up.  But for this type of game (and time committment), I think I'd rather play Roads and Boats.  Very similar game.  I kept saying, "This is like Roads and Boats".  Very puzzly.

RATING: 8
The game is obviously wildly overextended, doesn't really pivot into anything to justify that length, and features practically zero player interaction, but in spite of these practically irredeemable flaws I still enjoyed the game a lot and would happily play it again. The game has a single-mindedness about logistics and storage that's just charming, and the variations on board assembly and embassies seem to have a real impact on play. Although I suppose I would have to play multiple times to really tell...

Yes, if I had my druthers I'd probably play 2 Splotter titles in the same period of time, but Colonists exercises the brain a little differently and is much less tense. (Which could be a bad thing, but spending 8 hours on pins and needles might be bad for your mental health.)

The flipside of the coin is that I once felt the same way about Through the Ages after a few plays online, but further plays really brought it down and I don't think I'd enjoy the game much were I to play it again. It's possible that further plays would bring The Colonists down, but it's probable that I won't play it enough for that to happen.

I played a 4-era game of The Colonists with four people.  It lasted 8 hours and we are all quick players.  It is that sort of game.  Yes there are ways of setting it up to play just one or two eras but to do the game justice, and to feel the epic arc of the game, you should set a day aside to play.

It could have been designed by Rosenberg, so Rosenberg-like it is in the way workers move around resource-conversion action spaces.
Despite the fact that the game only slowly evolves and has a quietly developing arc, it does not drag at all, which is quite something.  Downtime is present but by no means a problem as turns are relatively fast.

Given Rosenberg is probably my all-time fave designer it was no surprise that I enjoyed the game a lot, given that his designs are written all over it.  But the downside is the game length, not because it doesn’t warrant that sort of extended playing time, but it is just hard to set aside such a time for playing a game.

Initial rating... 4 player... wow seem like a reworking of Le Havre that went off the rails. Each turn is like another. In addition you can't preplan as there is a cost when someone ends in the tiles you plan to move thru. Fiddle resource conversions and it just makes a long repetitive excercise. Needed more development before publishing because there is a good game in there somewhere.

At it's core it is a "build more choices as we go" worker placement, resource converting game. My kind of game! The downside is Colonists adds unneeded layers of upkeep. Acquiring goods, hiring workers, and constructing buildings all good stuff. Maybe choosing either feeding workers or building storage structures would have been enough added paperwork, but both adds tediousness. Further managing available and cold storage is just a bridge too far. Still, engine building is engaging.

Adding new resources and goals each era in theory is a good idea, but the execution here felt lack luster. You basically spend era 1 making the best era 1 choices, then spend era 2 replacing era 1 machinations (ie. turn all your clay into bricks, next era bricks into stone, etc.). This is not new to these games, this one really just drags it out.

Finally the "save" feature is laughable. If I have more victory points than you at the time we save, then we simply restart a new game where I have the advantage. At this point, let's just say I already won the last game?! Rebuying structures with these points does not take into account the # of actions you originally needed to acquire them.

Anywho, this is a good one to try, just let the other guy buy it.

Flat, boring, dry, dull resource-conversion game. And don't get me wrong, I LIKE resource conversion games! But rather than offer lots of options (like Le Havre or Ora & Labora), this game instead offers a very LOOOONG experience (which I normally like) in which you are constantly trying to optimize similar actions over and over and over. Seriously. Get wood, build hut that provides wood, get more wood, collect wood from hut and build more things that give wood, clay workers... No variable buildings, boring variable cards... There's just nothing for me here to like. You have been warned!

My 1st play was through all 4 eras, with 2 other players.  I was the only new player, but beforehand watched Heavy Cardboard's play through first 2 eras which was helpful.  
     6 hrs was set aside at RinCon, Tucson, AZ, but took 8 hrs with the last 1 1/2  hrs, rushed.   (I think a relaxed 10 hrs would have worked better for this first game.)  I found the first 2 1/2 eras easy, but the last 1 1/2 eras difficult. I knew what I wanted to do, but finding the tile, remembering what my embassies did, and what resources and what prerequisites were needed was taxing,   I mapped out on paper prior to my turn moves & resources needed, but these had to adapt to other player's moves.
     I gained the Alchemist early which gave me an extra turn throughout the game and a huge advantage, and just happened to leave him in unusable places for the next player.  My biggest mistake in the game was razing some farms which I later had to rebuild, & building too many resources of which I dumped vast quantities.  In the future I will decide what I want built in the end and will plan backwards to the 1st era for needed requirements.  
     I love this game, want to own it, and will play it in a heartbeat with adequate time.  This is where I wish I had a deluxe game table with a removable top.  Playing isolated eras, or half the game, is not appealing to me. 
     An improvement--someway to track of my current embassies' levels  & isolating their present ability for lightning fast reference.
     Second play, solo game with the Envoy Colony, all 4 eras (see Julie Yeager's PDF ).  Usually don't like solo games, but this one I do, very much.

RATING: 4
I'm sure this is an interesting game if you play all the way through.

For us, we stopped after the 1st era due to time, but I felt like it was like a lot of other euros with the 'goods exchange' spots, and trying to just get a better efficiency engine going.  Perhaps if we had 2 pawns out there, or skipped the 1st era, it would have been easier to block people to make it more strategic, but overall it felt like there were enough of the same/similar action spots that everyone was able to do everything they wanted.

If you like depth in your games this one has it spades. Compared to the amount of components and the size of the box the game is actually relatively simple. However playing the game well takes some experience it seems. I enjoyed my solo plays of it but don't know if I'll ever bring it to the table with more players.

Essen 2016: Impression after 1st game.

After a full (i.e. 4 eras) 2p game where both players knew the rules and had a prior 1 era game under their belts (thus further rule explanations necessary ) took  a bit over five hours (no, we are NOT AP players) I have to conclude this:
- I would never ever play this game with 4 players; with 3 probably just once (just to see how long it takes)
- especially in later eras players tend to have considerable amount of  stuff in their warehouses so handling all these chits become annoyingly fiddly and keeping up the storage rules (i.e. changing storage locations between warehouse and production facility) becomes a pain in the ass

Definitely ONLY for players who like pure empire building games. Therefore I guess many people will regret their purchase. My guess it that this will sell for max. 35 € here in the market place 6 months from now.

I love this game but I have a bit of a hard time convincing my spouse to play it with me because it takes a while. I think that is one of its features, that you get to finally build an engine that gets to run for a while before its over, but at the same time it makes it more difficult for it to hit the table. I wouldn't want it to be shorter though.

Egy elég jól sikerült hevijuró, ami talán annyira nem is hevi, mint elsőre gondolnánk. Maga az akcióválasztás, illetve a körünk pofon egyszerűen zajlik, így elég könnyen el lehet kezdeni játszani, ami nagyon szimpatikus. Ami hevivé teszi az leginkább a játékidő, ami elég vészes. Ugyan vannak rövidebb variánsok, de olyankor érezhetően nem nyílik ki annyira a játék, egy csomó épületnek nincs is úgy értelme. Fura volt még az etetés, ami nagyon nem hangsúlyos ebben a játékban, pedig az ember arra számítana, hogy az. Kaját termelni gyakorlat semmi értelme a játék feléig, háromnegyedéig. Rövidebb játéknál ez akár az egész játék is lehet.

Der Karton schreibt Epos. Man könnte Epos auch durch Kaugummi ersetzen. DIE KOLONISTEN ist ein Aufbauspiel der kleinen Schritte für Leute, die es mögen, wenn nichts passiert, während die Lebenszeit ins Land zieht. Bei 30 Zügen pro Epoche bei bis zu 4 Epochen braucht man Arschbacken aus Bizeps. Dabei ist DIE KOLONISTEN eine Art Rosenberg in Rohkost. DIE KOLONISTEN sind da fertig, wo Warenketten-Uwe erst anfängt ein Spiel zu entwickeln. Das Spiel ergibt sich spielmechanisch darin seinen Pöppel nacheinander über drei Felder zu ziehen und eine Tausche-X-gegen-Y-Aktion machen zu lassen. AMISH wäre der treffendere Name gewesen für diese Reduktion in Reinform. Der Rest in den KOLONISTEN ist Rechenspiel. DIE KOLONISTEN ist eine Brettspiel gewordene Computer-Solitär-Simulation, das im Grunde kein Gegenüber braucht in seinem monokulturellen Funktionieren, das auch nicht mehr sein will. Der nackte, konfliktscheue Optimierer wird hier sein stilles Glück finden und das sage ich ohne Ironie, die den Aufwand wertschätzen soll, die in der Entwicklung dieser Mühsal des Lebens steckt.

If you're ready for a LONG game, this is a good one.  That being said, you can play one or more of the "ages" in the game without playing the full game to customize the play time.  Reminds me a little of Agricola, but the gameplay isn't punishing.  Middle to heavy weight Euro with a lot of variability and customization in the board.  Choosing how to build the board adds a fun element to how you boost (or screw yourself) moving forward.

1. The Storekeeper colony special ability allows one to replace a storage facility with another building. The new building can be placed anywhere so a new storage facility can be built later.
2. The factory effect stacks with the Industrialist colony ability.
3. Trading Improvement card + Library --> draw 5 keep 3
4. The Altruist discount applies to every action. It can be applied to the Sale action at a Market to get free dollars. It can also be applied to exchanging goods via the Trader colony at a Market. It cannot be applied to the fee. The embassy does not have a buffer.
5. Every limited Improvement has 3 uses no matter what. If it's discounted take the resource from the supply.
6. Axe, Iron Pickaxe. and Spade --> works with immediate Improvements, Lord colony, and Subsidy action at Markets.
7. A steward can jump to the same market he's already at.
8. 2 stewards can swap places within a single half year.
9. Trader colony --> can only trade 1 good type to another at the Market.

11. Institute reduces the tool cost of both Improvements, not just 1.

There is not much to say about it, move your pawn through an expanding board (buildings are coming to the table as the game progresses) and try to build your hometown as the best. You need people to work on your buildings, they can be from 3 different types (more powerful but more expensive). Build the buildings you need (you need all of them, but you do not have space for all), improve buildings, gather resources, transform them... and use your storage the best you can (yes, it is limited).
Not much more to say, it has all those things you have seen in many other games, but really well done and really well implemented

Fairly meaty euro that uses a kind of worker placement/action selection mechanic. Actually somewhat like a Mac Gerdts rondel or pseudo-rondel a la Princes of Machu Picchu, except that the number of options increases throughout the course of the game. I guess it's somewhat like the logistics style of something like Neuland too. The player boards allow you to build buildings that then can generate resources or give other benefits. It has somewhat fiddly rules regarding employing your workers and resource storage but overall was an enjoyable, if long, experience. It does allow you to play a shorter version of the game, where you play less than the full four eras. It also has a kind of 'save' mechanic, so you can play an era or two and then come back and pick up kind of where you left off.

Only 6/10, because I think the coins should be more than just victory points. At least the one you have physically (not the ones on buildings and cards).

Very dry and a bit fiddly, and becomes more of a chore as it goes. Feels like it has the illusion of strategic depth more than it actually has. A lot of *stuff,* and a few novel ideas, but not a lot of cohesion. It also feels somewhat scripted, pushing you towards certain inevitable buildings and upgrades that will always come out each era. Ultimately, it was tedious and just not fun. For a similar weight, I *much* prefer something like Feast for Odin or Mage Knight or Fields of Arle.

I can see how time could be an issue with a foursome, especially for a first play. But along it goes, with many things to buy and use while pondering establishing diplomatic relationships with colonies distant from the one in the middle of the table.

A very solid, heavy, Euro game about resource management and conversion.  The flow is nice and our first 2 player play through took about 4 1/2 hours going through all 4 eras.

It's a bit on the long side and there is a TON of pieces but overall the game is worth the experience of playing from Era 1 to Era 4.

In fact after a few more plays it might jump up into my top 10 games of all time.

Oh how big and Euroy this game is. I just love it. It is exactly the sort of game that I would love and yet I think I would have a hard time getting my friends to play it with me. This is another one that I am super excited about but I probably wouldn't get for myself because I'm not sure if I could actually get it to table or not.

Colonists' game play largely consists of moving a pawn around the board, collecting resources with it, and using those resources to build buildings.  This is fine, but there are plenty of games out there that employ similar mechanisms and don't take 6+ hours to play.

First impressions. The Colonists reminds me of Ora et Labora but is longer and more complex. It offers a satisfying narrative development as the colony expands, more buildings come into play, as you move your focus from farmers to citizen to merchants, and as the embassies provide increasing possibilities. It seems to work best with 2 players, is playable but rather long with 3 and is just not worth playing with 4. In general, it is overlong and in need of streamlining especially if it wishes to claim to be a 4-player game.

Phenomenal game with so many options each turn, especially as the game moves forward.  I would DEFINITELY not want to play this with an AP prone player, there are just too many options.  

The game is quite long though. Not to the point where it wears out it's welcome because there isn't a second of downtime as you are constantly weighing your options. When 4.5 hours feels like half that, you have a good one on your hands. Unfortunately, the length will keep this from hitting the table as much as it deserves.

RATING: 8
3 plays with 3 players so far (1st: 1, 2nd: 1+2+3, 3rd: 2+3+4)

Tentative opinion after 3 plays:

Era 1 is not very interesting after playing it a couple of times (all you do is setup your basic engine of green workers, wood, and clay).

The tiles started to sprawl and get incredibly bloated by era 3/4 (markets help but it can get frustrating without extra stewards and/or the ability to jump spaces (stables/embassy).

The game is way too long even if you just skip era 1 but luckily the rules for starting from an era of your choice are pretty good. As such I can't see myself ever playing a 3 era game again. I don't know where the sweet spot is, whether it's best to play 2+3 or 3+4 or just a 1 era game.

I'm undecided for now. If i end up only playing this as a 1 era game then i will inevitably end up comparing it with other similar games of similar length and wonder why I own this as well as them (le havre, ora et labora etc).

Very good looonggg engine building game. Reminds me of Le Havre. It took us about 3.5 hours to get a first time play in and we stopped at the half way point. So, probably a 5-6 hour 4-player game. (Correction: It took us 9 hours to finish a 4 player, 4 Era complete game.)

Outrageously over-complex, "fixed fun" game with little to no interaction. Thematically dodgy as well.

The game goes on for much, much too long:: Four of us played *one era*, which took two hours, plus another hour for the rules explanation. Most of it was solitaire resource conversion and miscellaneous micro-management actions. Boring as hell.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A promising resource-conversion civilization building game. The variability comes from the modular board design which is determined by the players during play, the improvement cards which function like the improvements or occupations in Agricola, and the eight different colonies to which the players may build embassies to gain special powers.

The Colonists is heavily dependent on the players to control the length - an AP prone table will cause it to drag unacceptably due to the intricate action chaining required, but a fast table can get through the game in 90 minutes per era or less even for 4 players.

This rating may rise once I've had a chance to play more than two eras in a sitting.

RATING: 5
Bad input/output ratio. In the time of one Colonists game I can play two Agricolas and experience a multiple of challenging decisions, turn angst, rewards and enjoyment. Part of the problem is the number of players. The Colonists gets equally longer with each additional player without adding much or anything at all in terms of gameplay. It's the incarnation of a multiplayer solitaire exercise up to a point where I'm wondering why they included a spot for becoming start player. There is no real blocking and the fee for using an occupied spot is neglectable. Later on, there will be so many action tiles that this will rarely happen anyway. I daresay that it's probably best as a solitaire game when the hassle of other players' turns is eliminated and the input/output ratio is best.

This game is also an example why converting a successful computer game into a boardgame isn't the best idea. Computers are good at handling extensive administrative tasks - passing out resources, observing many small rules and restrictions, retrieving an item from hundreds of other items. When colonies grow, these tasks reach a point of hampering gameplay. While the game gives the option to only play a limited number of the four eras, the real game just starts with the third or possibly even the fourth era. After two eras, different strategies only start to yield varying results. Up to this point, not much distinction between players colonies is visible with results still being close.

I can see that this is a game for puzzle-loving gamers who enjoy building up their own playground. Planning out the three-action move each turn is enjoyable and gives satisfaction. For me, it just doesn't amount to a worthwile multiplayer game.

This game's biggest problem is the sheer amount of setup required, even for a 1 era game.  I like the mechanics, the art, how interactions happen between players.  I just never want to set it up or put it away.

If you have a table that you can leave it setup on, that would be ideal.

It's light worker placement/resource management.  Don't let the box fool you.  It's not as tedious to manage as the pieces might lead you to believe.  There's just a wealth of things you can do.

The movement of your Steward (Action Pawn) around the hexes raises this beyond a bog standard resource engine creation game.

I am really sad that this game didn't work for us at all. We love heavy Euros, we are cube pushers, it is what we do. 
Unfortunately something didn't gel with this lovely game. All the components are there, but it feels stifling and pointless. Waiting for your opponent to play is dull, and though the puzzle path should be intriguing, it isn't fun. 
We tried multiple games at different times to see if it was our mood, or something unrelated to the game that was hindering our enjoyment, but nope... 
This game needs asymmetric starts with a themed society to play, and a goal to work for.  Some direction of some kind to drive the direction of the game. 
It just didn't work for us. It seemed like it had all the trappings of a great game without actually being a game.
I mean no disrespect to the makers, it is obvious that a ton of work went into it, and I really enjoyed the flavor text as I was card sleeving...

Not sure what to think about it.

It's cool!
It's fun!
It's anno in a box!

But after a while anno felt like doing the same thing over and over and I got bored with it.

I feel the whole playerboard part could suffer from this too. If that happens the game would be reduced to finding the optimal route on the worker placement board.

RATING: 6
An interesting game, that I may suggest from time to time because we all here love optimization worker placement - but still the game is more tending towards a 6 actually. 

Because the mechanics are a too repetitive and the overall feeling is that it is really only optimization without real theme and also too long, because the next age does not change so much that it feels worth playing so many ages with so many years and even half years... Also the colonies actually feel like too much because they add to many special rules (one is ok, two maybe, but up to five?). And last but not least the market board could have been fixed, the build up of the village seems artificial and has no thematic background. You could have used a nice painted picture with the different locations (maybe adjusted like a puzzle after each age by a part with the new locations), that would have added more thematic feel. 

But on the other hand it is not that cut throat competition, more a parallel single player experience - and that is being liked by quiet some members of my gaming circle. Also the optimization works very well and it has the feel of an Agricola without too much problems with feeding your crowd which often frustrates the casual players. So I use this one as an entrance game.

RATING: 6.5
It's a well-oiled machine, for sure, but after playing 2 eras I was exausted from not doing anything, such was the wait between turns. Also, production and getting the most workers is clearly the way to win, but that's such a boring process of rince and repeat produce-convert-upgrade mechanisms that I mostly went for improvement cards and embassies just to keep interested, even though they get you near to squat in terms of VPs. 
A friend of mine LOOOVED the game, so I made him happy by selling him the game at a pitance. Might play again with him, preferably starting in Era III, just to see what I missed during my plays.

RATING: 6
The Colonists is one of those games that like TI3 get most of it's weight from it's length and not from the complexity of the decisions you make from round to round.  Most turns you have a clear cut series of moves and it baffles me when people take longer than a few seconds to make their decisions.  I've played this game three times now.  One with just era one, one with one and two, and finally the all four.  Each time I felt like the game was too long and too repetitive for what it is.   (It's worth mentioning that I won all three games so it's not like I'm crying over a loss).  There is something really cool about seeing your colony increase in size and scope, but those changes never feel like an evolution and as such just feel samey.  Also, it's one of the most fiddely games I've played in a long time.  I can't help but think the game should have been baked a little longer the in oven  to create smarter components and a wider degree of player actions.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

We only played the first two ages in our learning game but I really enjoyed the game and the logistics puzzle. Games will vary a bit due to how the map of tiles end up being laid out and being the start player allows one to control that more. I do want to play all four ages at some point but need to get at least one other dedicated player to do so as I expect it will roughly take 20-30 minutes per player per age.  Different paths to VPs seem viable and I am curious to explore the colonies more which grant special abilities (This is where the most variability occurs as every tile will be played out on the board - the only unknown is when and where). Might be my favorite game from Essen 2016. Plays well solo from all appearances.

Wow, was ein langes Spiel! Aber ich find es richtig gut.
Wärend dem Spiel läuft man mit seiner Spielfigur 3 Felder weit und führt jedes Feld aus auf das man landet. Mit diesen Aktionen baut man neue Häuser oder wertet diese in Höherwertige auf. Diese Häuser wiederrum produzieren Güter oder Arbeiter, die man braucht um weitere/bessere Gebäude bauen zu können.
Zeitgleich kann man in Kolonien investieren, die einen globalen Bonus geben (man muss Mitspieler nicht mehr ausbezahlen, wenn man aufs gleiche Feld kommt, etc.)
Das ganze spielt man 4 Zeitalter lang, jeweils mit 5 Jahren, bestehend aus 2 Jahrezeiten mit jeweils 3 Aktionen. Nach jedem Jahr erhalten die Spieler Erträge, müssen ihre Arbeiter ernähren und es kommen neue Aktionsfelder ins Spiel.
Ich hatte wirklich Spaß daran eine Engine aufzubauen. Ich hatte durch mein Theater und das andere Ding (pro Runde 3 Münzen) 63 Münzen produziert, die jeweils 1 Punkt wert sind...
Ich muss aber auch sagen, dass die Entscheidung was man denn nun tut in seinem Zug sehr schwer fällt. Ich hatte mich auf 2 Sachen spezialisieren wollen und dann doch was anderes getan nur um 2 Runden später wieder was anderes, Erfolgsversprechenderes zu tun.
Wenn ich das Spiel schon gekannt hätte, hätte ich anders spielen können, da mir zukünftige Aktionsplättchen nicht unbekannt gewesen wären, aber so war es eine tolle Entdeckungsreise. Mit mehr als 3 Spielern aber ungerne. Zu dritt spielten wir knappe 4,5h dran.

RATING: 6
Despite not being a fan of either modern point salad games or Rosenbergian nano-action games, I was kind of eager to try this one. I'm not crazy about Agricola or Feldian nonsense, but I thought if given room to breathe, maybe this sort of thing will appeal to me. 

The Colonists isn't bad, and it's not as overwhelming as an 8-hour game could be. The way the actions are done is pretty clever, and there isn't a crazy amount of downtime, though the number of options can be a lot to sift through at times. There are a lot of things going on, but it's all fairly manageable. 

What it is, is long. And I'm not sure there's a payoff for that. Though more expensive and different buildings and workers come out as the game goes on, I didn't get the sense of any kind of narrative or experiential arc. It was just more of the same, really, and the choices in the fourth era were pretty much the choices in the first era, just with different resources. (There are cards called "Automobile" and "Steam Engine" but I never felt like I was out of the same time frame as I started.) I wanted there to be some kind of ebb and flow, as in Mega-Civ, or some kind of feeling of moving through different eras -- feudal, renaissance, industrial, etc -- but I never really got that.

Without that feeling you're left with a game that is fine, and I have no problem playing, but doesn't really do much to earn its playing time back. There are any number of agrarian engine building games I can play in a third of the time and get an identical experience. 

The Colonists has a nice mechanical design. Things more or less make sense, and the only bit I found intrusive and silly was the different levels of storage one had to accommodate. That was a bother with little real payoff, and one I'd just as soon get rid of.

It absolutely has to be said that the embassies in play can make a huge difference on the game. Two that we had in play went to great lengths to drastically alter a lot of the experience. With one, we could get some resources from any space, eliminating some of the resource juggling. With another, we eliminated the fees required when occupying another player's space, also eliminating what little interaction there is in the game. This made it into a more solitaire, less puzzly game, and a possibly very different one from whatever I'd be playing if I started up another game tomorrow.

I can't really say anything bad about The Colonists. I didn't have an unpleasant time, I came in a close second, and I'd play again. But at the end of 8 hours I didn't feel like it really paid off.

The colonists m'a beaucoup fait pensé aux jeux de Rosenberg.
On développe son plateau personnel, dans lequel on construit différents bâtiments qui nous rapport force de travail, ressources et points de victoire. Pour cela on choisit des actions (récupérer des ressources, construire de nouveaux bâtiments, transformer des ressources en points), qui arrivent au fur et à mesure de la partie, sur un plateau centrale. La mécanique est d'ailleurs assez sympa, avec une composante spatiale : les actions sont des hexagones et on doit faire des actions adjacentes à chaque fois (enfin, on peut aussi se rendre directement vers un marché si on veut changer de zone). On peut aller sur des actions occupées par d'autres joueurs mais on devra alors lui payer une taxe.

Une partie se compose de 4 époque, avec des bâtiments et des ouvriers de plus en plus puissants et demandeurs. On peut ne jouer que certaines de ces périodes, pour des parties plus courtes.

Car le jeu est long. Je n'ai pour le moment fait qu'une partie avec les époques 1 et 2 et on a mis plus de 3h (on était pas forcément très rapides non plus). Une partie complète est annoncée d'environ 6h.

Mes impressions :

Après une demie-partie seulement (une partie en 2 ère)

Le thème est malheureusement très faible, je m'attendais à plus. On a par exemple aucune idée de l'époque dans laquelle on joue, et je m'attendais à autre chose en voyant la boite. 

La mécanique centrale est sympa et apporte un petit quelque chose de plus à le pose d'ouvrier. C'est par contre un peu casse-tête et du coup les tours peuvent être longs. Il y a une mécanique de gestion des stocks de ressources, avec trois types d’entrepôts à travers lesquels ont peu faire circuler les biens quand un seul est accessible pour utiliser les biens. Les différents types d'ouvriers (3 seulement) de plus en plus demandeurs pour des actions plus avancées semble également sympathique (mais plus pertinent à partir de l'âge 3, je suppose).

Les règles ne sont pas très complexes, il y a par contre beaucoup d'actions différentes et plein de tuiles à trier partout. C'est un peu fouillis et peut-être un peu gratuitement.

Il s'agit vraiment d'un jeu de développement où il faut lancer un moteur. J'ai eut l'impression qu'en âge 1 il n'y avait pas vraiment de possibilité d'orientation très différente pour les joueurs, et qu'un joueur qui a pris de l'avance sera très avantagé par la suite. 

La règle indique que l'on peut jouer un seulement une ou deux ères, mais ça m'a un peu donner l'impression d'une demie partie.

Globalement, j'ai envie d'en faire une partie complète prochainement !
C'est probablement un bon jeu de développement à la Rosenberg, mais ça ne me paraît pas être la perle du siècle avce un effet boule de neige peut-être trop prononcé (peut-être moins le cas sur une partie complète ?). La durée de la partie, le temps d'installation et de rangement et l'absence de thème font qu'il ne sera pas facile à sortir.

Impressions à confirmer, bien sur !

AP Fest.   Mechanically and thematically I like this game. Everything works from a mechanics perspective.  However, the problem is with the way the game unfolds and grows as you play, with more, and more, and more and more options/actions getting added to the playing field.  The first era is relatively pleasant, introducing you to the game and moving along at a quick rate. The 2nd era things get more interesting but already the game is starting to slow down and churn a bit with the plethora of options in front of you.  By third era, the game is crawling and there is no end in sight and you've already been at it for 3-4 hours...

The silly thing is,  each decision you make is pretty inconsequential since you get SO MANY actions over the course of the game.  One turn may end up being pretty insignificant.  However, the game almost forces AP upon you with all the options and the fact that you don't really want to have a bad, inefficient turn even if you tell yourself not to belabor it.  This is made worse by the storage mechanics which, make sense and work in practice but also throws a wrench into your plans making it even harder for you to carry out the actions you want to take.  Further penalties for using the same space as another player make this an AP-nightmare.

I am not usually someone with AP but even I could feel my turns slowing down tremendously and myself getting locked up towards the end of Era 2 and the start of Era 3.

I would play this again but I'd have to be convinced or in the right mood.   For me, there's a lot of other meaty, long game that I'd rather play before this one.

Medium weight Euro with streamlined mechanics. You are a governor a colony and you have an agent in the Mother country to gathers goods for your colony.  You can collect resources, transform them, build buildings, get development cards or establish an embassy with another colony.  

I love this game in that there is little conflict and you try and optimize the work you do.  I really enjoy this game, so much so I have even played it solitaire.  

And if there is a criticism, it is that this game can be multi player solitaire.  However, there is a fee you have to pay when you go to a location with another player.  This happens surprisingly frequently even in a two or three player game.  I really liked the game.

The Colonists is a deep and crunchy game that offers a basic kit on which to build a variety of scenarios.  Already, the designer has published three scenarios in Lookout Ausguck magazine and one of them has been translated and published on Mayfair's page.

Lots to do, lots to think about, excellent multiplayer and solo challenges, including the ability to start in later eras.

The major criticism I have of The Colonists is that there are no adjacency rules for placing buildings on your colony.  I would very much like to see that integrated into the game.

The minor criticism I have is that the game should have been issued with a booklet of scenarios from the get go.  That would have shown it is a system (like Roads & Boats) that has specific ways to play it.

Designer promises solitaire rules:

First impressions:
Fairly straightforward game play.  It will be a game I leave set up to play over multiple nights since it appears playing through only era 2 will be very unsatisfying.  

I was expecting there to be much more variety in the type of buildings available.  It appears the colonies available from game to game will help switch up your strategy instead.  

There is a ton to think about in this game, but it doesn't really start to blossom until the 3rd era.  You're juggling multiple resources, being able to sustain your citizens+, finding an optimal path to build the buildings you need.

I can see this being a bit samey after you hit the 5-10 game play range.  To be fair, that's a decent amount of hours logged with the game at that point.  I'm also not saying the decisions you'll be making by the 10th game would be automatic.  You'll still be working hard to plan ahead.  You're just taking actions over and over so it may feel a bit repetitive.  

Would definitely benefit from scenarios and an expansion that adds more building variety.  The amount of support this receives over the next year or two will determine if this can keep a spot on my shelf.

Looking forward to playing this some more.

The most EPIC euro game I've ever played.  Not that it makes it my favorite.  For logistics, Roads & Boats does it better.  For goods conversions, I'd take Ora et Labora.  For city building, Small City.

But none of those feel like the Colonists does.

This game starts at a crawl, doing seemingly unimportant things.  But as you progress, you realize those trivial decisions made an hour ago suddenly have decided whether the crucial move you need to make now is feasible, or if you've now fallen hopelessly behind.

The Colonists laughs in the face of poor planning.  It feeds upon the souls of the careless.  It's fires burn with the charred remains of the brave fools who thought they could tame it (wait, is it a creature, or a machine?).

Abandon All Hope, Thee Who Enter.

That's what the dude on the cover is saying.

Heed his warning.





Heed it.

"The epic strategy game" -okay, it's epic in the sense that game is long and tends to AP especially towards the second half of the game. The game doesn't feel satisfying to play, despite the incrementally better citizens, buildings, tiles, storage, and etc. Actions felt a little bit samey as you have to make your decisions based on those that yield more points. As a result considering the length of the game it's better to invest the time in playing something else than sitting through a dull ordeal. Overall it's a good game with great potentials but a big letdown with forgettable gaming experience that felt flat. Thus sold my copy.

The test at the fair does not really helps. Unfortunately you were just allowed to play the built up phase, where you more or less just collect resources. The interesting part was not played. There might have also been also a chance to skip the built up phase and start with the more interesting part to get a better impression of the game. Especially if you keep in mind that this one is clearly addressed to pro gamers.
It's too bad, that not this second way was offered to the testers. So we will look for another chance to test this one.

The box says "The Epic Strategy Game" and it definitely delivers on time -- expect 10 hours for a full 4 era game at 4 players.

Which is insane, and yet, it manages to keep my attention the whole time. The perfect balance of simplicity with depth emerging from gameplay vs replayability through randomization of setup and game development.

A masterpiece of development... though the rumours that this was an 8 era game as originally presented to the publisher make even fanatics like me shudder.

Excellent uber-euro: resource conversion, engine building, turn efficiency, resource efficiency, pipeline concerns, and, of course, worker sustenance. Perhaps this is the game Uwe would have designed if he hadn't discovered Tetris in 2012.

My 2p games have ranged from 3.5-5 hours but never felt long. Still, this puts them in the appointment category and make me nervous about scheduling 3 or 4 players. With time I expect some of the game to become formulaic, but those aspects are as likely to become intuitive as rote. The random order of the tiles and market cards provide a tactical reaction nature that is just the right amount of volatility, while the random draw of the colonies guarantees a drastically different overall experience to each play.

Players must balance many puzzles: storage bandwidth, sustenance needs, worker flow, tech tree management, action efficiency. It's an engaging, thinky, and rewarding game.

I had to try this one out. We played the first 2 eras and at 90 minutes an era it was far too slow for my taste. Also it is a wash, rinse, repeat game where the board develops very slowly. I was flooded with resources with nothing to do with them - inexperience? I am not inclined won't play it again to find out as there are plenty of other games which make a far better use of my gaming time.

A very solid game that is simply WAAaaaaAAAAaaaAAaAaaaaaaaaay toooooooooo long for what it is and that is coming from someone that greatly enjoys epic all day/multi-day games. 

The problem is that this one doesn't provide any grand narrative arc or sense of significant development for the time invested. You're essentially doing the same thing in hour 6 that you were doing in hour 2 apart from moving around a lot more chits. Almost all late era tiles are just more expensive versions of earlier ones, so while they yield more points, they just cost more resources and you're still doing exactly the same thing. 

The rules do offer suggestions for shorter games, and we've played fewer eras but that's just not satisfying enough. 

The final nail in the coffin is that there are other games that scratch the same itch in a fraction of the time. Feels like a multiplayer solitaire Uwe game that is less forgiving and 4x as long. I'd rather play Keyflower and two Rosenberg games in the same time and when I want an "epic" euro I would pick something like Roads & Boats over this 100% of the time.

I generally like build-up worker placement games and games that consider themselves to be 'epic'. That's why I picked this up. We played two games (2 players) through all 4 eras over the course of several days. This worked fine as we can leave the game pieces on the table.
We liked the game pieces, game play and the interesting idea of moving the pawn through the capital. However, we never really experienced any competition for certain work order tiles, there always seemed to be a way around it or we were just able to do something else. I am missing the thrill of Agricola, Le Havre or Caverna taking work orders before someone else takes them or the hindrance of a blocked order space. This made it a bit dull and feel like solitaire build up game and caused a rating of only 6.
The game desperately needs interference from and to other players, maybe in an expansion.

The Colonists is a profoundly weird game, a game too simple for meaty civ-gamers but too long for casual gamers.  But it's a solid game nonetheless.  I can't wait to see what Tim Puls does for an encore.

I can see the real joy in The Colonists happening in a four civ epic game, watching the colony (and your chunk of the empire) growing from simple means to massive merchants and embassies in five bordering colonies... but that joy will mean finding 3 people who understand the game mechanics and strategies, AND wouldn't rather play FFG Civ, or Archipelago, or TtA, or any of the other 3-4hr civ builders with a known player base.  I can't wait to find them.

心得:
基本上是一個要考慮生產儲存的遊戲
生產資源或人都要能存
要蓋建築物也要有夠的人來操作
分數上相對不直觀
要想的有點多
可以感受逐漸建設起來的成就感
但沒有特別的combo感
卡牌抽區也稍微運氣一些
規則:
*洗勻9張殖民卡，隨機抽四張(進入時代三會再抽一張)，拿對應的外交官建築放一旁，根據不同的殖民卡使用不同的供應庫跟配件，隨機起始，先放一個兩格的市場，然後把時代0建築全部洗勻(日工移除)，照順位每人拿一塊拼到圖板上，拚放時至少兩邊相連即可，有洞也沒關係，12塊放完後起始玩家放第二個兩格的市場板塊，至少一邊相連板塊且跟起始市場距離兩格以上

*遊戲最多經過四個時代，可中途存檔或不同時代開始，每個時代進行五年，每年分成上下兩季，每季每個玩家三個動作，每年結束會收成跟維持一次
*每個時代清掉之前的時代卡並放置對應的時代卡，根據時代卡設置，拿對應時代的市場卡洗勻抽五張蓋著放在回合卡旁，並開第一張，選取對應時代的設施卡，之前時代的移除(手牌無關)，在選該時代的地點板塊洗勻疊起，時代卡同時代表外交等級上限跟手續費
*每年開始時開一張新的市場卡(舊的移除)，開三張新的地點板塊，回合標記放到回合卡上，每年的起始玩家同一人，一季一個玩家三個行動後換人，之後一棟回合標記在照順位三個行動後一年結束
*每次行動在中央地點板塊上一棟你的工人，第一次隨意放到市場上不算行動，之後根據你的移動力移動相鄰格後停止執行地點行動算一次行動，連需三次後換人
>三次行動後停留地點不能跟一開始一樣，市場除外
>經過其他玩家工人要付走付手續費，市場除外
>地點行動要能完整執行才能去
>從任意格跳到任意市場算是一次完整行動，可做市場行動，兩格市場算是同一格
>到市場時是市場卡上的三個行動擇一做
>建築時如果沒標示上限可建多個，但是只能用儲藏區的資源
>當你有多個工人時，三次行動可分別任選工人來執行移動跟行動，但同格不能有一樣工人
>蓋建築時可從住宅區移工人過去才有作用(建築左下顯示要用什麼工人)，但是只有在一年結束才能把工作的工人移回住宅區，住宅區要升級上面要有工人，擴建不用
>蓋建築時可取代舊的，要額外支付兩個工具，拆住宅要有對應工人且一起移除，拆有工人建築工人回住宅
>農夫以上工人派去工作時要支付費用，每年結束有工作的也要再付一次，可用收入卡紀錄
>工廠三色工人皆可放，但只會增加對應顏色工人的所有建築產量1，可疊加
*儲藏規則  分成儲藏區倉庫跟暫存，除工具跟錢外其他拿到時一定要存(倉庫或儲藏區)否則棄掉，暫存區時生產卡生產當回合可以暫放，容量為當回合生產的量，行動要花資源時一定要從儲藏區花費，不能在此時從倉庫跟暫存區拿，遊戲除行動中可任意把暫存區的移動到另外兩區，儲藏區跟倉庫可互移，支付工人的薪水時則可用任意區來支付
*設施卡手牌上限6，不能棄掉，不能抽超過6，有特殊建築時才能暫時超過，之後棄到對應數量，要到對應行動才能出
*每個人每種外交建築可蓋一棟(一場四種，時代三以上五種)，每次蓋可蓋任意建，或是任意升級，最多只能升到跟時代同級，某些外交建築會引入可使用特殊工人的規則，第一次使用可隨意進場，之後照規則使用，全部玩家共用，基本上每季可動一次，進場要到市場，且每個移動力是2(可照自己移動力升級來使用加到他上面)
>煉金術士   只有在圖板獲得時可以交換，生產的不行，慈善家外交官功能獲得的可以
>慈善家 每年一開始可以拿一次資源，越高級使累加拿
>使者 增加移動力
>工業 每次生產階段時可以升級物品，生產前或後都可用，只看最該類型的最高轉換次數不累加，也可放工人當工廠使用
>工人   可交雜使用工人到不同建築物，工人不再加時也可升級直接換工作的工人，要付費，工廠只看工人不看建築
>領主 可取代原板塊行動，不能取代市場，交換板塊時上面不能有人
>學者 內建設施卡抽四選二，等級1跟2不會同時發生
>商家 增加儲存量，二級以上可把儲存建築跟對應等級建築交換，只需支付手續費不用建築費用，可跟減免手續費建築連動
>交易 在市場時可做物品交換行動，同級才能換，最多可換更更一級的，2:1換，高級的能換成低級的，個數為差距等級數+1
*每年結束依序處理以下步驟
>新的起始玩家為拿起始標記的人
>起始玩家把開的板塊加到圖板，有些地點是取代不是外加
>每個人可以把工作的工人放回住宅區，只有這時候可以回來
>結算所有工作中的高級工人的維持費用，不夠付的就要強制回來不用付(有特殊外交官也可減免支付)，可使用收入卡計算之，食物衣服如果扣減支付有剩在生產
>生產階段，除食物衣服以外的生產在這時候
*遊戲結束時，所有建築右上金幣分數，加總自己拿到的金幣跟工作中的工人分數(2/6/16)，平手順位後的勝利
***從較後面的時代開始***
1.決定起始
2.由起始開始輪流設置主圖板，輪流放置，從0放到你要玩的時代的前一個時代，每個時代放完換下一個，且執行每張時代卡第一行的設置
3.每個玩家隨機拿一張跳過時代的永久設施卡放在面前當做已打出，然後從上個時代的設施卡抽兩張當手牌，然後選擇起使外交建築，普通建築跟物品，每個不同的開始時代有不同的金幣可以花費(可限制只能放最多三個金幣建築，外交官建築沒花完的可用來放正常建築)，每人額外拿一個食物，跟對應的工具
4.處理一次維持階段
5.生產階段，之後可以開始遊戲

Looks like a clever sort of worker placement, but each turn your single worker moves 3 times (usually to an adjacent hex), activating that tile. Gather resources and...I didn't read the rest. Apparently it's a pretty standard resource/building engine game. 

Apparently there is little interaction (yay!), but the game could run long (6 hrs?). You can play only certain of the 4 ages, such as starting in 2 and ending after 3. 

Probably a bit abstract for me, but could be OK.

In The Colonists, you move your pawn around a hex board that grows as the game proceeds to execute actions associated with the hexes. For the most part, you're getting resources, resource conversions, or the ability to buy specific buildings that either provide resource income or workers with which you can man your building Puerto Rice-style. I only played the introductory version, so I feel like I didn't really experience the game, and but I'm certainly interested enough to give the real game a go.

The games rules are incredibly simple, almost deceptively so. Nothing in this game is ground breaking, but it all melds together in a nice package. The complexity comes from the spatial aspect as well as the continual addition of tiles to the game board. Each era adds 12 tiles which only increases the length and decision making of the game. I don't think I could do this game with 4 players in the same way that I really wouldn't want to do Mage Knight with 4 players. Honestly the only thing more players add is the tension for tiles and downtime. 

I've yet to do Era 4 and we only partially played Era 3, but I look forward to actually sitting down and playing a full game of this. The Embassies remind me of Key Market with the guilds and I think that's what truly makes this game stand out. Without those, I think this game would be good, but not great. With those, it takes it a full notch above.

I am looking forward to the additional eras as I've heard that this was originally planned for 8 eras. Not that the game feels incomplete, but I feel like it's missing something. That would be quite the game though, probably close to 10 hours or more to finish.

I have truly enjoyed my first few games and look forward to many more down the road! I am a huge fan of engine building with tiles, especially with a puzzle aspect.

I really enjoy the theming of the game and think that the designers did a really great job with this one!

This game is supermodular in the form of that you can chose how many era's to play or even start in a latter era and you will have 4 out of 9 colonies.

This game suffers from a major problem. If you play the full game, it's way too long and there is not enough variety in what you do in each era to warrant such investment in time.

WOW this is a beast of a game! Alright this game is long, very long for your first play to grasp everything. The symbology is a lot but easy to understand.

Lots of potential here and I am so very excited to explore this game further. Can easily be a top 10 game for me. Seems to be just awesome. Very excited for this one.

The game seems intimidating, but in essence, it's move your pawn to an adjacent spot, then do the thing is says. The AP moments simply come from having to plan out three of these moves in a row, with the end goal of being able to advance your engine in some way, usually by pickup and delivering something. The game can be very long depending on how many acts you play. The effects of buildings and tiles in act 3 and 4 are much more interesting than 1 or 2, and it's kind of a pity it takes them so long to appear. I like this game, but I'm still working out of the experience of the game warrants the long playtime.

The phrase "Epic Strategy Game" is a good description, if by "epic" you mean complicated and long. A full four-era game is an all-day affair. The game offers interesting and meaty decisions to make throughout its entire length, and there is a satisfying arc to your development (if you do it right). But you had better REALLY like logistics games, or this one will feel like an endless slog. It is not for casual gamers.

I haven't rated it yet, as we have yet to complete a full four-era game. So far we've had one play-through of their example rounds, one era-and-a-half session aborted because we discovered we'd made some major errors, one three-era game that we ended because it was 1:30am and we would not have time to resume the next day, and one game currently in progress that we paused at 1am after three eras, and will resume and finish soon. :-)

Bottom line: excellent if, and only if, you REALLY like complex logistical games and don't mind the length.

Epic Euro game, but a bit too much going on for me. Especially the constant storage room optimization is not enjoyable to me. I would always prefer Ora et Labora to this ressource conversion game.

One thing struck me as unbalanced: The highest class of citizens gets a lot of points when working in a building (which is fine for most buildings), but you also put them in a very cheap building (Manufaktur in German).

Truly an epic experience.  The building of the city and your own colony has a great look and feel.  Very puzzley and a great resource management engine.  The only down side is it's a bit fiddley with the player board.  The colonist fall down and its hard to get all the resources on it in the correct places but if you can get by that than there really isn't a 5-6 hour epic colony building game like this.  It'll be too long for some and I wouldn't play with more than two as the turns are long and soaked with thought but if you want to get lost in your colony than this will satisfy your hunger.

First, I play solo. I love the mechanics of the hexagonal variable board. The rest not so much. The micromanagement of each of the locations (I use cubes because the meeples are too big and cover the Locations), the enormous number of pieces and the incessant fiddling seems too much. Also, in my case at least, very easy to get confused on the season and turn. I had to make play-sequence cards to be able to keep track of the whole thing. But I can see that it can be + interesting if the fiddling is not a problem.

Best new epic for me in 2017. I do think I prefer it with 3 players over 4. I have mostly played it for the full 4 eras but my one play of just era 2 & 3 was quite good. I may end up preferring it that way in the long run. The full game does get to be a bit much by the end

Solid game, plays smoothly even though it looks complicated at first.  In reality, the game is fairly simple.  You just have to make the best plan to accomplish everything you want to do.  There are a few tough decisions to make and there's always something to do even if you get blocked.  The only downside are the fiddly tokens and having to stack meeples and resources on buildings; it gets messy real quick.

--Feb2017-- I really enjoyed the play.  Even though, after seven hours, we'd only played three ages and called it in exhaustion.  So my rating here (not very good) is a mix of "I rather enjoyed this" and "I'm not sure I want to play again; or, at least, not any time soon."   Much, in fact, like my rating for [thing=154][/thing] (which feels subjectively very similar to me, even if they share nearly nothing in presentation of mechanisms.)

This is an interesting idea for a game, but I think some of the colonies make too many of the action spaces interchangeable or useless, which leads to a less interesting experience. A big part of the game is about building up your storage space, your workforce, and your production. It's novel to have a game that can be played over multiple eras where you choose the starting and ending point. I've only played the first 2 eras, but I think playing through eras 3 and 4 would be more interesting.

Jeez.  Heavy, deep, and approachable isn't something you see often, but this is it.  Great modular board mechanics and quick gameplay for a game that is so long.  That said, my gut is telling me that this is one that I may have to trade simply because of length and the inability to get a full game done in one sitting.  I'd certainly avoid playing it with anyone that was even remotely AP.

I have only had the opportunity to play the Introductory Game.  I was very impressed with The Colonists overall and felt that it was a complete gaming experience.  There is a lot happening within the game and it really feels like a synergistic composition of elements from many other games.  I can’t image the development time that went into making everything work in the cohesive way that it does.  However, even the Introductory Game is fairly lengthy, so playing the full game seems like a time investment that I may never be able to commit to doing.  Being able to “save” the game in between Eras is a fantastic feature that definitely makes playing a full game over several sessions an attractive possibility, but I still don’t feel like I’ll ever have the ability to do that just based on time limitations and interest in other games and hobbies.  Also, it seems necessary to play with other players that have similar gameplay experience levels with The Colonists to keep everything on an even keel.  I’d like to play this game again at some point, but it is a lot to take in.  I would really need to be in the mood to play something heavy and long and that’s just thinking about the Introductory Game and not the piles of other stuff that gets added with each subsequent Era!

It's very involved logistic puzzle resource conversion game. Game would only shine if it is played through to the era 4 although I've only played to era 3. Era 3 things really changes and ramp things up to get ready for era 4. But the enjoyment you get is probably not worth the 6 plus hours of it.  3 action turns structure creates lot of down time also specially towards the latter era.  I found a lot to like in the game, with variable embassy powers and feelings of developing your colony from ground up is there but with time involved it'll eventually be two player only game for me and that's a shame. I'd like to try skipping era 1 and go era2 to4. So I reserve my judgement till then but unless play time reduces significantly it'll stay 7 for me. There are lots of other epic heavy strategy games I'd rather play with that time frame.

much to like and explore here, engaging and rich game-play and have only played solo so far, hopefully there will be expansions... however location tiles, chits, and player building tiles could have been bigger and possibly more clearly illustrated so that certain tiles would be easier to identify, meeples seem oversized compared to rest of game and help make production buildings very fiddly- the storage building tiles are perfectly sized and yes would have made for large amount of table space but that would have made the game much less of a fiddly experience; mechanically I wish there was something in the game to make use of coins, such as at the market being able to buy a resource you need... seems like a missed opportunity; also wish produced goods could somehow be converted into money during the last production phase, even if it were a small amount it would be better than feeling like all that hard work to get production going amounts to nothing at the end

Really quite excellent. I love that the board is variable, and you're working a path each round to get through your three actions. It turns out that paying your opponent or getting the first choice to place new tiles is enough to merit some decent player interaction. I like the long strategic arcs here, as you work your way through the guilds to score victory points. A quality newer title.

RATING: 8
This is a kinda sorta worker placement city building game.  Despite how incredibly complicated and chock-full of bits this game is the mechanics are reasonably simple.  Each round the village gains new locations/worker spots and players take turns moving their workers around these spaces using them to gather resources and build buildings on their own personal town board.

This is basically an engine builder's dream.  It isn't as simple as get resources, build buildings, earn points.  First off, resource storage is a huge mechanical layer of this game.  There are three different storage areas and rules about when you can move resources from one of these areas to another (I highly suggest for a first game you go pretty lenient on this particular rule) and resources can only be immediately spent during an action from one of these three storage areas.  On top of which in order to use all the buildings you build you need to staff them.  Workers come from specific buildings as well and better buildings require better workers which require harder to obtain resources and harder to build buildings.  Not to mention the better workers also require more and more upkeep at the end of each round.  Even better storage areas require workers to staff them to use them.

So this game takes some planning and a good engine to make your life easier and not a constant "paycheck to paycheck" struggle.  There is also a lot of neat mechanics that play into this system.  There are 4 or 5 guilds in each game and you can earn higher and higher rank within them as the eras go by and get really cool special powers.  There are also special cards that you can collect and play for anything from one time effects to game-long permanent special abilities.  This makes for a very variable game experience.

It is also a loooong experience.  This is going to scare a lot of people away from it.  My one play took between 5-6 hours (that does include rules explanation and setup) and that was with only two players.  And the game would increase quite a bit with more players.  While I think a 2 player (full, more on that later) game could probably be brought down to 4 hours I think you have to add another 2 hours per player after that up to 8 hours for a 4-player game.  The reason I said full game, meaning all 4 eras, is the game details rules changes for playing as many of the 4 eras as you like and start in any of the 4 eras you like.  Of course you miss out on the whole experience if you do that and having played the full game I wouldn't want to play a truncated experience.  This is why the BGG page suggests it is best at the 2-player count and I don't necessarily disagree with that but at 2 you also miss out on some of the mechanics that get fuller with more players such as needing to pay a fee if you use the space another player is on.

In the end it is an excellent game for its variability and clever and balanced mechanics.  As for looks and feel, it is functional.  At first the symbology on the cards seemed very cluttered but I certainly didn't feel that way by the end (of course I had close to 6 hours to get used to it).

Beautiful game.
We've just finished to play the 4 ages in 4 times. 
It's really a good complex game like my hunsband an I like.
You have different ways to win, (so different strategies), depending on the number of players.

I think that playing the 4 ages once is really too long. 
Fortunalely you can stop within 2 ages by taking photos.

And you have a special game to introduce new players.

A beast to set up and sort, but this game has a lot going on. It is presented well, and with incremental increases in complexity. I enjoyed the action selection, laying out the board, and the individual community I got to build.  The nature of the game is to try and select a combination of tiles to visit that will both provide a usable reward in the current term but will also leave you in a position to make good use of the board layout in the next season.  I really like that the variable layout is progressive, adding new hexes each year, and that all players have access to all opportunities if they can plan their turn to their best advantage

Each player has a pawn (or more than one) which moves three steps around a hex-grid of action spaces, expanding each turn with new options, but generally for resource acquisition/conversion or the purchase of buildings for the player's own tableau. It isn't allowed to move into a space without activating it, so there is a spatial element to planning and identifying synergistic chains.

Points are scored primarily through buildings, through workers (only score if operating a building) or by producing money either with income buildings (pub etc.) or by selling goods at a market.

Part of Colonists' claim to fame is how this unfolds over four separate eras (of perhaps a total eight, the remaining four as-yet unpublished). Because a full game is extremely long -- with four beginners I would not be surprised at 12 hours -- there are rules for playing only eras 1-2, starting at era four etc.

My [i]initial[/i] enthusiasm for the game was that, while the first era is spectacularly uninteresting, the second picks up: players can achieve much greater differentiation. There was reason to think that this would continue in the third era and the game would flower into something worth playing. 

One of the issues with the game ending in the second era is that you start to pick up resources which only make sense in the one following, e.g. ore only useful from the third era onwards. But it turns out that both of the odd-numbered eras are, in a significant sense, setting up for the eras after. Much more than in the second era, a number of buildings in the third are only worth having with a longer time-horizon due to sheer cost. A game ending after three eras might be even less satisfying than one ending after two. ... But lest I give the impression that the full game makes it all worthwhile, the final era is all the boring parts of the era two with none of the anticipation.

Two specific criticisms I think highlight the general lack of focus. The first is the storage requirement and the ungainly, overcomplicated rules around the five different kinds of storage location (storage, warehouse, specific-resource improvement warehouse, resource buffer, consumable buffer...). Storage limits are required in order to prevent factory abuses, but the net effect is to slow everything down. Le Havre is an interesting point of comparison here because one of the things that makes that game interesting is the number of potential strategic opportunities arising from unbounded conversions -- if you can get a million fish then you can probably get a million points from them.

A bigger problem is that it just doesn't go anywhere. Where games like Roads & Boats and Duck Dealer have specific, hyper-valuable resources worth building long conversion chains just to reach, Le Havre has its boats requiring boat-construction materials etc., civ games tend to have "wonders" or other late-game scoring features, in the final era the Colonists just stops: you score from having lots of employed workers and having built lots of stuff, but up to that point it's all just about growth and efficiency leading to more growth.

Real player differentiation is harder than it looks because of the common board. Some embassy abilities are so powerful that all players will get them, so only the ill-considered improvement card mechanism provides true unique advantages. But these are [i]wildly[/i] uneven and add an excessive degree of randomness; I can't point to those as a feature.

In the end, a player who is 10% more efficient will earn 10% more points and you will have all wasted six hours. 

Simultaneously over- and underdone.

Basically a disappointment. 
I had been expecting a strategy game (like the Rosenberg games from the same company), yet I got a spreadsheet exercise like those computer "strategy" games from the 90s. 
The basic production and development problems are entertaining for 1-3 solo games but I feel not inclined to play any longer. 
The spatial arrangement of the tiles (especially the myriad of different builder tiles) serves no purpose other than to annoy the players. Same with the separation of storage and warehouse rules. 
Some interesting concepts with the colonies, but overall not enough to warrant repeated plays. 
Not a bad game (I gave it a 6.3), but - considering the hype - a disappointment.

Remember to get storage ...LOTS of storage. the first two games I played one rule wrong.   farmers and citizens do not earn Vp's at the end of the game if they are not productive.  Sitting in the apartment or on the farm will not get vp's.  Truly love this game.

Quite often, when I get to the end of a euro, I find myself feeling unfilled.  I invested an hour or two into a game, built some kind of production or victory point machine, and then the game ends and I feel I don't ever get to use it.  That's fine for those that enjoy shorter games and feel happy afterwords, but I hate it.

This game is truly epic.  You build up a strong base of production that you must rely on later in the game.  While there is still way too much to do and not enough turns by the game ends, it still doesn't have the same feel of urgency as Agricola.  It takes several plays before you can learn what to build early, because you must build up a strong foundation in order to be able to build late game buildings quickly, but it is simple at its core and is very intuitive.  Overall, everything I've been looking in a game for a long, long time.

Long and monotonous. The gameplay was cool when you first started but as more and more tiles came out it became a choir just to keep track of where the action spaces are, let alone going through the efficiency puzzle. I was almost falling asleep, at least it wasn't as bad as Mage Knight, but just slightly worse than Through the Ages. But if you love those games ... you'll love this.

tl;dr: good, but also a bit like work

Lookout has built it's reputation on publishing heavy gamers games. This year they continue that trend with yet an other all out heavy strategy game in a huge box, with 3 rule books and more than 20 punch boards. Yep, not for the faint of heart.
But I usually like these kinds of games as long as they play well and don't take too long.
This game gives players a LOT of options. You can choose from a bunch of different eras and embassies. You can even choose how many eras to include to make the game longer or shorter.
We played the 2 first eras with 3 new players. That took us almost 2.5h. This year's other big, longer games that I've played so far, [thing=193738][/thing] and [thing=177736][/thing] also took us that long or even a bit longer, but they didn't feel that long. And this one does feel more like work than those. I think that comes mainly from the fact that you have to perform all actions you land on. So if you need to create bricks, but to get there you need to pass over a building action, you need to make sure you have enough resources to do both those actions, even if you don't really want or need that building action. And storing resources can be challenging. And on top of that you need to manage your workers.
Everything is very interconnected and performing the simplest task requires good planning. Being efficient and accomplishing your self imposed goals requires a lot of planning.
I wouldn't say this game is heavier or more complex than the other aforementioned games, but it does feel a bit more like work and it was not as fun as those games (which, granted, both are a ton of fun).
But it certainly is intriguing and challenging, so I look forward to trying this again.
I did have the feeling that the publisher maybe went all in with rules and components because that is the market they where going for, even though making a slightly slimmer, slightly more developed game could have been better.
But still, a solid game

From all the reviews I could see, stellar game however on the long side and the first part of the game seems kind of a set up for the game, maybe if price lowers

This is long and the tiles are too small, but I do really enjoy the puzzle. The solo extra scenario is excellent as well.

Critical darling for about a week and I can see why. It doesn't have legs. Too fiddly for what it is. Seems long just to be long.

I have played this around 8 times now. It's a great game but I definitely want to be in the mood for it. I've only played the full game with all the eras.  Each game has lasted at least 5 to 8 hours (mostly played over 2 days).

Production chain and storage management. Very good, if a bit long. Two player game with full four eras took roughly four hours.

I have played this game 15 times.  My high score so far 286 on 4 eras.  Game is super long.  4+ hours.  I like the game but do not like it more than Terraforming Mars or Feast For Odin which scratch a smaller but somewhat similar itch and much shorter.  I am beginning to ponder if I need this game along with the other Euro's

RATING: 8
From a "gamer's game", hardcore, heavy Euro perspective, this is the game to get. Not that it's mechanically difficult, only that it becomes difficult in keeping up with all your options as the eras progress. It's the Euro version of a monster wargame. Expect to spend the whole day playing it if you intent to go through all four eras.

Pretty interesting game. I like the complexity and general balance and that the order the hexes come into play affects the game a lot.

Setup is bad with uncompensated benefits for early players.
The hexes are too small, very hard to see what they do and what the buildings they produce do. The hex sides should have been about 50% bigger.
I Also dislike the start player mechanic (that you can lose it after taking it).
It plays petty bad on 4p.

I tried an Era I solitaire game, and while I found it an interesting puzzle, I wasn't wowed by it. I suspect it would be more interesting either with more players or in a longer game, so I may update my rating if I ever play it more.

"The Epic Strategy Game" civilization game as mayors of individual villages trying to be the best at growing our population.  Create jobs, educate and employee workers, and build community and housing with limited resources and storage constraints.  The heart of this game lies in the action selection using area movement of your mayor pawn along the modular arranged hex tiles of the central city and the tile placement as the city grows.  The meat of the puzzle is the movement limitations of the mayor and requirement and that the mayor must be able to use each selected action space.  Not sure how that applies thematically but it creates a very interesting efficiency and planning puzzle.  Interesting tech tree choices and I like the random neighboring villages that allow access to different actions through building an embassy--nice.  It's nice that the designers provide save points to stop/resume an in progress game but I bet with all the pieces and configurations and levels to track I can't imagine this being practical. But, the option to play a shorter game and not go the full four eras is a thoughtful inclusion.

Colony management game.  Very much a slow-build game (game length tends to be over six hours). One of the key mechanisms in the game concerns storage; you can't spend resources until after they've been moved to warehouses, which means that generating large amount of resources can result in a lot of waste, so you have to focus on building an economy that provides exactly what you need.  Replayability is high due to the hexagon tile map of action spaces and the different colonies that you can build embassies to (for differing bonuses).

A full play through of 4 eras is too long and the resource conversion gameplay is not that fun.

RATING: 8
This certainly is an epic feeling Euro game. It's definitely a time-consuming game but I love how every game is different due to the different positions of the tiles and the different embassies that are present each game. I do feel like the game becomes a small bit scripted because there are some obvious senses of buildup and progressions that feel a bit scripted in nature but I'm still a bit unsure on this point.

Nice game, has the potential of getting repetitive, however I'll need to play several more sessions to confirm this. I don't agree with the current Complexity Rating of the game however, it's a around 3 but certainly not a 4.05 (at time of comment).

"The epic  strategy game". Nunca la firma de un juego ilustró con tanta plenitud lo que ofrece. Épica es la palabra que resume la experiencia de juego de The Colonists, no os dejéis ahuyentar por las cifras de duración que agitan los que ya lo han disfrutado. La diversión que se han llevado con él es igualmente colosal, desborda cualquier marco lúdico razonable de salud. 

Con The Colonists uno no se queda con hambre, sí con ganas de volver a jugarlo, pero no con hambre. Tras la partida sólo hay sonrisas llenas, redondas, mejillas sonrojadas por la pesadez del cuerpo, adormilado de estar tanto tiempo sentado, y al caminar no se ve lo que se tiene enfrente, ante los ojos sólo desfila todo lo vivido en la partida,  en una plácida digestión, como en una nube ¡Y se han vivido tantas cosas! ¡Qué carrera económica, señoras y señores! ¡Levantando casa por casa, planeando los pasos a largo plazo a través de la matriz de acciones que se extiende por el tapete y adaptándose a los movimientos de tus rivales, a lo que llega cada año de juego! ¡Y cuántos años transcurren hasta que el juego llega a su verdadero fin! Cada partida esa una ración extra que invita a saltarse cualquier dieta lúdica. Que el tiempo no te impida disfrutar de él en toda su dimensión. Nada de ponerse límites de tiempo, hay que saltárselos, jugar a The Colonists es un plato especial y bien merece la dedicación que pide. 

¿Con cuántos juegos te has sentido crecer, inmerso en el navegar de un inmeso árbol tecnológico, haciendo brotar recursos de la nada, cada vez en más número, devorándolos cada vez con más ansia, sacando lo mejor de ellos, yendo directo hacia una meta imprecisa pero sin duda elevada, mítica que no alcanzas a ver pero que sientes ahí, cerca? No tienes tiempo para calcular los turnos que quedan para realizar La Jugada. Si pudiera hacerse sería digno de recordar, y lo intentas, lo trabajas. Hay que llegar allí como sea, te dices, llegando al punto de desarrollar tu economía hasta esa cima que representa esa jugada maestra que has estado cocinando, piedra por piedra, y al sentirte a un paso de provocarla, de dar sentido a todo y que se culmine tu papel en el juego, que desate un Apocalipsis de jugadas enloquecidas, imposibles de parar, que estallen en una bacanal de recursos y disparen tus puntos de victoria hasta el infinito. Te descubrirías de pie y no sentado cuando eso ocurriese y exclamarías en un resoplido de completa satisfacción: ¡Esto es por lo que juego a juegos de mesa, por Dios!

Pero no, en muchos juegos, grandes juegos también, el sueño termina un turno antes, hay que contar lo puntos de victoria y a ti te ha faltado ese tiempo, ese turno maldito que nunca llegó que te iba a permitir alcanzar ese exceso, ese punto glotón del que ya está satisfecho pero que quiere un poco más porque está taannnn bueno. Ese turno de más que te sacie, te satisfaga, no llega, te quedas ahí, a un paso tonto. 

Tras tan prematuro final tan sólo puedo pensar en el diseñador del juego y preguntarme en silencio porqué, porqué no un turno más, qué había de malo en tener un puñado de turnos más. Tan sólo puedes intentar mantener la exigua llama de ese placer absoluto e inalcanzable que creíste acariciar advirtiéndoles a tus compañeros tras la partida que, un turno más, señores, sólo uno más, y los habrías deslumbrado con una jugada colosal.

En este juego tienes ese turno.

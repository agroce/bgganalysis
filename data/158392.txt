One of you is The Thing and has to infect the others.  The rest of the players need to find a flamethrower and hopefully torch the right player.  An amusing mechanic with cards making players swap places around the table.  Not the easiest game to jump in and play with new players.

A light, chaotic and loud filler, Stay Away is a good slightly horror-themed game to play with many: the unpredictable duration of each game, that may vary considerably, is still an issue though.

Holy crap! What a pile of ...! Get this game if half of your group likes to just sit around and do nothing because that's what will happen all the time! Oh, and the other half will have to make uninformed decisions until all of your group is bored enough to end this tragedy. Stay away!

Found it a fun and interesting game for people wanting a bit more in their deduction games. Over two weekends, we played 6 games of 4, 5, and 7 players. 4 players (the minimum) is pretty weak for this game, and I don't recommend it. Larger player games open up a lot of fun possibilities, but make sure you have a good table arrangement for hot-swapping of seats.

Provisionally recommended.

A group of archeologists has mysteriously disappeared during an expedition to the risen island of R'lyeh. You are a member of a rescue team sent to aid them, but as you investigate the site, you encounter something terrible that seeks to destroy your team from within...

You'll need intuition, nerves of steel, and clever acting if you're going to survive and win the game. Who will believe you? Who is whom, and who is what? You can't trust anyone and no one will trust you, so block the doors, quarantine a suspect, reveal your identity to your "allies", grab a flamethrower, or run away — but look carefully where you will end up because "The Thing" might be closer than you think...

In Stay Away!, 4-12 players try to track down "The Thing", a creature  awakened from a nauseating eternal slumber on the emerged R'lyeh island that has the capability of possessing the human body, cloning it, then taking its place, so as you play you won't know who "The Thing" is or when someone will become "The Thing" or who is infected or not. The archaeologists are looking for The Thing; their goal is to work together to identify which player is The Thing and roast it with a "Flamethrower" card. You remain Human until The Thing passes an "Infected!" card to you during a card exchange, at which point you become an Infected and take on that new Role: You are now an ally of The Thing and must take care that its identity is not revealed.

RATING: 3
Great theme for a game that's about 100% dependent on chance. Card draw determines pretty much everything, including wether or not there's an actual chance of defeating the Thing: in our game, for example, the Thing player was the only one with access to the flamethrower... which is the only weapon that can kill the Thing, making that player effectively invincible. Not good.

RATING: 2
If you have to choose between playing this game and get shot in a leg, i know you'll choose the first options. It's reasonable. Afterwards you'll realize you should have chosen to be shot.
Really a bad example of game design, can end with some players who don't even have a chance to play.
Note: this is the rating for the new revised edition.

RATING: 7.5
Actually I quite like this hidden traitor game. The thing is only as effective as the number of infection cards they draw from the deck..or get passed by those already infected and the humans generally are quite paranoid but there is not all that much you can do to avoid the inevitable trades. the panic cards are a nice mechanic as they force you to play them and they usually change the turn order around a bit which allows the thing to move to a new set of neighbours without tipping his hand that was what he needed to do.

Card stock is a little thin and the cards are already showing signs of wear after only 4-5 games so this will need sleeving.

It's a good game, but it due to the way the cards are set up, it can lead to bad games. Use my variant of adding infected cards to the starting set based on number of players in the game so the Thing gets some help and do a simple role reveal phase as well.

Mechanikájában Bang-re hasonlító parti játék. De nagyon hosszú, nagyon sok a holtidő, emiatt nagyon unalmas. A Bang-be nyíltak a kártyák, így tudjuk mi történik, jobban részesei vagyunk. Itt a fertőzés titokban terjed és ha nem vagy érintve, akkor nem is tudod mi történik, csak unatkozol közben.

Can't image after reading the rules, that the game is balanced. In 4 to 5 player game for example there is obviously only one card in the whole deck (the flamethrower) which is needed for the humans to kill the thing. If they don't get this card, they can't win the game... seams pretty silly for me. So i canceled my pledge at kickstarter and wait for reviews.

first play with about 6 players and it seemed that the mechanics were half-baked and contrived. The group seemed to give it a thumbs down also. I am willing to try this again to see if we missed something though, but it seems very chaotic and wild, with low chance of thoughtful play.  Too bad, I really wanted to like this game... a mashup of The Thing and Cthulhu.  Oh well.

The new rules upgrade this game and are interesting, dynamic and funny. Played and made play in Essen 2014. To get the gaming flavor start with 6 Playera at least.

-edited- after much more games I wish to add that it works on his target a lot, one of my favourite during Christmas vacations!

-edit- revised edition correct some minor problems.

The greenish greyish art was a turn off, and the gameplay didn't change my impression. It's the usual social deduction formula with some swapping seats and other shenanigans thrown in.

Theres a good game in here struggling to get out, but it's brought down by some flaws that make the experience patchy and uneven. When it works it works well, and can be a very good time, but there's a chance it won't.

Games are quick w/ a few players, especially once players are eliminated.  Infecting other players secretly to win as the bad guys is a nice mechanic.  Maybe having the option to remove the infection could open up new gameplay.

RATING: 9
great party game, suggest 5+ players in order to keep the suspense of "The Thing" high. Quick to set up and just as quick to learn. Be prepared to get out of your seat often as "Panic" cards will have you playing musical chairs as "The Thing" tries to close in on you. I would not suggest this game to those that have mobility issues due to the need to move about the table often; besides that though it is a fantastic game!

This game takes a core mechanic (Werewolf/mafia) that is interesting-but-flawed and adds many more much worse flaws without fixing any of the original issues.

- So, the Thing does not eliminate players it infects -- which sounds like a good direction.  Except that there is still rampant player elimination because that's how the humans fight back.
- The Thing can infect players, and those players can then win the game -- so why do humans care about stopping the thing?  They'll win either way!
- There is supposedly social deduction, but most the game is about randomly drawing cards that give you perfect information, not about drawing subtle deductions.
- Seating order shifts and is important, but it changes at the whim of card draw so a potentially unique game dynamic turns into an annoying chore without any real benefit to gameplay.
- Players have to remember if they are infected or not -- there is game stat not represented anywhere in the game itself.  Having an infection card in hand doesn't mean you're infected, and you have to look up a bunch of easy-to-get-wrong rules about when you are allowed to pass/discard infection cards.  A single misplay ruins the entire game, but looking at the rulebook gives away your secret.
- The Thing is responsible for honestly telling players when everyone is infected, which is a memory chore for a player who has a strong incentive to mess it up.  Plus they could be eliminated before the game ends (in one of the recommended variants) but they have to stick around to allow the game to finish.
- The humans are suppose to be deducing who the things are, but they rely on randomly drawing the right cards form the deck.  The game is often more about lucky draws than deduction.  The overall level of luck-of-the-draw in the game undermines the ability to make social deductions and undermines the influence of those deductions.

Some similarities with the werewolf games, but with a well implemented John Carpenter's The Thing theme. Plays fast, bur perhaps not a party game due to seat swapping mechanics and a need to keep track of discards, card exchanges and hands. Simple, and pretty fun!

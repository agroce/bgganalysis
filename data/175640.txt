RATING: 8.5
I've scored the game an 8.5, even though personally I'd score it a 6, because I'd wanted my score to reflect the quality of the game rather than my experience of it.  It's a clever, thematic game with a fantastic production quality and a board that my wife described as the best looking she'd ever seen. 

I think the game is great for what it is and what it does.  But it's not me personally - it took 1.75 hours to set up and have the rules explained to us (which didn't include even looking at the end game multiplier tiles!) and then it took 3 hours to play.  There were so many things going on it was all initially a bit baffling.  I enjoyed it more as we started to grasp the mechanisms but overall there was just too much complication, which for me reduced the enjoyment.

Too much squinting at a zillion tiles for me.

I vaguely recall enjoying my plays of the 2016 version but in hindsight they were quite forgettable; didn't capture my imagination the way Kanban and The Gallerist did. Outstanding production and art design, and I'm keen to try the original Vinhos rules.

First play rating of 2016 game, so subject to change on replays. I absolutely loved this game on first play, but the two friends I played it with did not. They cited long set-up / tear down time as well as well as dislike for the multiplier tiles. They also felt the art was 'dull', although I personally find it harmonious and pleasing to look at. I also liked the 'random' elements of the weather, multiplier tiles, and experts, because they provided things that require adjustment and change up the flow of the game, rewarding some level of adaptability in an otherwise very strategic game. I found it surprisingly easy to teach and there was virtually no rule-related confusion, which is rare for a first game of this depth. The player aids make excellent rule briefings for new players, although I did not find myself referencing my player aid at all. Overall, I loved the smooth flow of the game and the way the different areas of the game force you to make hard choices (to sell or claim multipliers is to spend barrels that could be used for exporting, which gains immediate points... submitting a valuable wine to the festival means not selling/exporting it... when is it worth to promote a wine?). There are lots of great decisions to be made, turns are quite quick with the occasional slow-down on turns near the end during which players are calculating points per move (although that depends on your group - one person in my group counted out the last three moves in advance, along with backup plans!). Speedy with a broad but non-paralyzing decision space is a win in my book.

Abstract:
The designer Vital Lacerda is quite popular and famous for heavy euro games: CO², Kanban, The Gallerist, Lisboa.
Vinhos is also a heavy worker placement, economic euro game with area-control about wine making. A game has only 12 actions and each action counts (mistakes can be unforgiving). Fun player interaction based on shifting the interest of certain wines by press releases. The deluxe edition is much more streamlined (requires less planning).

Thoughts:
I am not interested in the theme, so I prefer other worker placement games. It takes some time until you earn rewards in this game.

Similar to The Gallerist, this one has been on and off of my wishlist several times. Ultimately, having two versions of the same economic game is excellent, and the sheer production quality is alluring. We have many mid-weight Euros, leaning on the heavier side. Having this on would easily be the heaviest we would own, but I think it would remain compelling and interesting each time we play.

Ein Lacerda wie er im Buche steht. Irgendwie sind mir seine Spiele etwas zu verkopft und nicht elegant genug. Sie sind alle interessant zu spielen und haben thematisch durchaus Sinn, aber irgendwie fehlt mir der gewisse Feinschliff. Es gibt hier eine Bonusaktion und dort, sodass die Züge immer mehr aufgebläht werden. Ich spiele lieber andere Spiele in dieser Kategorie.

Initial Impression: Lacerda and Eagle-Griffin do not disappoint. This game has outstanding production values, easily comparible to The Gallerist. All cardboard components are chunky and the pastel colors convey an almost serene theme. The gameplay, however, is anything but. With only 9 different actions and 6 turns in the game, the designer has managed to create an incredibly enjoyable brain-burning experience. Tabasco for the brain! I believe that Vital Lacerda's greatest talent is his ability to successfully convert processes into game mechanisms and integrate them thematically. When I first played it, I was hoping to hate this game. Didn't work. It's now in my collection.

RATING: 9.5
Vinhos seems to hit that sweet spot of short-term tactical decision-making, long-term strategic planning, reasonable play time and decent variation between plays. Plus, you get 2 games in 1. If you want a deeper economic game, you can play 2010. If you want something that digests easy, you can play 2016. The 2016 version doesn't feel too heavy -- it feels only slightly heavier than Agricola in weight, once you get the fairly intuitive iconography down. As another plus, at least for me, is that Vinhos provides a number of differing strategies to employ without leaving you wandering in search for a strategy. Further, every decision ripples through to the end game. It's a great game.

Love the option of playing the original or the updated versions of this game.  Love the theme.  Love the interconnectivity of all the elements.  Love the sheer brain burning "thinkiness" of this game.  Love the satisfaction of the production phase when your vineyards are set up perfectly.  Love how the weather tiles can make you change your strategy.  Love that you can get a wine expert to see the weather that could potentially change your strategy so you can get a jump on changing your strategy.  Love the solo variant.  Love the wine fair.

I love this game!  It may be my favorite in my collection.  So satisfying.  Every decision you make is tough as you try to optimize your vineyards.  Beautiful game and components as well.  Vital Lacerda has become my favorite designer, so many good games.

Played once with the 2016 Special Vintage rules. So a provisional rating. Might go up.

At first this seems a hefty game with a complex rule set, but once you're two rounds and a production phase in, it has a very natural flow. I didn't quite feel the theme, although obviously a lot of effort went into that. I guess that's because of the art. It's quite pretty and clear and clean, but also a bit function over form. It does help gameplay though.

It's traditional euro game engine building, but not in a way that a mistake in the first round sidelines you, since every move gets you something you end up needing. And the starting money makes the first rounds easy to start with. Mid game, finance does get tight. End game, serious AP moments are abound. It's this nice arc of starting of slow. slipping into your strategy and making your last move count the most that makes this game shine.

Things that are important to consider at first play;
- Inform yourself of the scoring opportunities of the purple tiles. They're potentially 25% to %40 of your end game score.
- Don't underestimate the importance of player order.
- Beware of going all-in competing on the wine fair. It may be cheaper to get points elsewhere.

Nice. Like to try this one again some time.

Uno de los mejores euros que he jugado, su version 2010, la original es bastante exigente y te hace sufrir bastante.
La version 2016 siendo un 80% como el original, la han conseguido modificar para que no haya tantos problemas con el dinero y se pueda jugar de una forma menos agonica, pero tambien es muy buen juego.

Beautiful version. After one play, I'm interested to find out if there are different openings or if one has to start with as many vineyards as possible and if the randomness in the magnate cards are a plus or a minus.

After two plays, and winning while starting last in a 3p game, I like the variability and replayability. Great fun.

Had to up my rating to a 8.5 after introducing to 3 new players in a 4p and everyone came away thinking more about the game so much so that one person actually bought it.

I think the deluxe version really is a beauty and worth owning even though it is indeed very expensive.

I have only played the 2010 version of the game one time, but what a game! Wow! It's an amazing game. All parts / areas of the games come together really well and make a lot of sense. This is a game for people who love heavy strategy. There is so much going on with many choices you have to consider in every turn. I can already see that you can use different paths to victory depending how many players you are and how you adapt to their and your choices. There is definitely a lot of replayability here. I only played it in a 2-player game and I would love to try it with more players next.

The game itself take some time to learn. I think we spent around one hour going through the rules and the first playthrough took us 5 hours but if you like heavy games it is well worth it. The game is so rewarding if you like complex games.

The quality of the components are amazing and everything about this game feels high quality.

Ah, that Lacerda "click." It's the feeling you get halfway through your first play of one of his games, that moment when all the exquisitely balanced systems click into place and you begin to see the endless permutations of strategies available to you. I previously experienced it with "Lisboa," and while I still slightly prefer that game (probably because I've played it more), "Vinhos" is equally outstanding. But it's not just a collection of "good maths" - it's also quite the looker. No less than three people walked up during our game to, "Ooh!" and, "Aah!" at the board and the game's various and sundry little pieces. Beauty and brains is a beautiful combination in a board game, and it's a Lacerda staple.

[19 June 2017] - 7.25 (2 plays)
Two plays of the 2016 vintage and this feels like a good worker placement game. Some of the rules around the fair and the action selection need a bit of effort to understand but the game as a whole feels smooth. The icons are better than the Gallerist, making the player aid unnecessary IMO. The difficulty with the game comes from getting enough turns to make the best wine. For me the lower rating comes from not yet running into the brain burning part of the game. Both plays haven't felt overly complex or uncomfortable to deal with. Going to give it some more plays as well as trying the 2010 vintage before making a decision about the game. Production is top notch. 

[18 Oct 2017] - 8 (9 plays)
We finally started playing the 2010 vintage game and the extra banking action spots make it a much more interesting game overall. The wine fair mechanics are still a little clunky in the 2010 version and that keeps the game from rising higher in rating. Overall with the two rule sets and the beautiful artwork, this game has replaced Viticulture as my preferred game about wine making.

This is a really neat game.  Can't help but compare to Viticulture which I like a lot but prefer Vinhos.  Both scratch a nice itch .  Viticulture is a simpler game running your personal vineyard with a luck of the draw component.  Meanwhile Vinhos has you operating a wine empire purchasing multiple vineyards and burns your brain and leads to moments of AP.... I want to do this, but wait I should do this first, but wait I need to do that before I do that... and so on.

RATING: 9
I've been a big fan of Vinhos -- and Vital Lacerda's designs -- after my first play. I'm not going to comment on the game itself here, I'll leave that in my Vinhos comment, but rather address the deluxe vs original edition.

2016 version -- I have somewhere north of 10 plays of the original version so I expected to be predisposed towards that, but I quite like this one. Sure, the bank action of the first edition made money much tighter and is a unique constraint that I'll always like, but this offers a different type of fun. 

Here, you start off with 10+ bagos more as well as a bonus action from the get-go such that you have a lot more wind at your back at start. I was tempted to roll my eyes at this, but the effect is enjoyable to me in the same way Brew Crafters is to Agricola. Context: BC is like playing Agricola with a lot more bonus powers. It makes the game easier in some respects but is still a tight game in its own right. But having more bonus powers is simply fun. It's a variation on a theme without either one necessarily being better. Same here. It's differently enjoyable to start off the game with more breathing room and be able to ramp up more quickly. 

The big change, of course, is the fair. It's more streamlined yet, I find, offers more reason to get in earlier than in the original. In the original version, I pretty much always skipped taking the wine fair action as it's more efficient to do something else and then present right before the fair. Here, as part of the fair you draft bonus actions, and there are some that you may very well want more than others (my group has particularly taken to rushing for the sell/ship barrels for money/VPs bonus tiles). Consequently, there's a tension here that was not in the original.

Bottom line for me is that the 2016 version offers a variation on a theme I love a la Brew Crafters and Agricola. I could play any combination of these four games in an evening and be equally happy.

Lastly, I can't help but lament the loss of the original art and make a minor complaint about this version. I find it hard to read the tiny text, most especially the small vineyard region numbers, and a friend pointed out that white text on colored background is considered less than best practice. Furthermore, the wineries and vineyards were made to blend in with each other artistically, but the result is that you can't quickly see which is which. The art got out of the way in the original, here it's in the way such that I gripe about it when I play and can't quickly see something. It feels like artistic design won out over function. Eh, it's a minor complaint but there it is.

Revised 2010 version -- I read the list of differences in the Reference book and they're all slight variants that my group has already been playing with except for the new region that gives you a farmer.

2017-01-24: Played with the "Special Vintage 2016" version of the game. (The new version without the bank).

Still, this game eludes me although a LOT of my gaming-companion loves this and also adores KanBan and The Gallerist.
For me, personally, it is too abstract how to react to get points. At least with 'the bank' gone it doesn't feel quite as punishing. But it was to long ago I played that version to say if it is a good thing or not. I am almost certain this version is easier to [i]learn[/[i] at least.

In conclusion: I can see there is a good game here but it is just a bit above my taste.

The game is surprisingly streamlined for the amount of moving parts. Actually feels a lot like Viticulture and not just by theme.  It's a very tight game where you always wish you had just a few extra turns.

The art and components are of the highest quality. The kickstarter stretch goals are nice though don't add much to the gameplay, which is actually a good thing.

Rating based on the Special Vintage 2016.

The streamlining of the original has improved certain aspects of this game; the magnates are no longer as complex an element to deal with, the removal of the bank has simplified cash flow, and press releases are now basic.

That said, I preferred the 2010 Reserve's chrome; I prefer the use of wine experts in that version, that weather could affect the significance of the different wine qualities, that you had to pay your enologists, and that all of the actions and multipliers for all of the magnates were available from the beginning.

As undecided as I am on which version I prefer, this is undeniably a great game.

Good game, point sallad with mechaincs that work with all part beeing ok. But nothing that really grab me. No new or evolved  mechanism. Many standard euro mechanisms added together to a complex and long game with no strong theme or other stand out feature. Would rather play Viticulture any day of the week. 

- Most beautiful art of any game, except Scythe. 
- Complicated board with lots of ways to get VP. 
- Quite hard to get an overview. Impossible to calculate best move.
- Risk of AP is 97% if players care about winning. 
- It is quite long, but you do not get a great feeling of building an engine with great combos. Instead you just add alot of tiles and meeples that almost all give +1 to your wine. 
- The only wine theme connection is wine cellars where you store your wine to make it better.

Whew! Man oh man! This is an awesome game, but be warned... it is not a game for the faint of heart. Some people might pick it up quickly and learn it fairly fast because the icons on the board are very well laid out. I believe with a few games under a persons belt, it would go a lot smoother than it did for my first 2 player game. Watching videos helped get the feel of it. Actually playing it required weeding through the setup, and playing it seemed to find us constantly referring back to the rule book to find out if we were playing it correctly. As you play through your fist game you learn quite a bit, but this game will take the average player a few plays to get comfortable with it. There's a nice little cheat card, and lots of icons to help you out and these will be a breeze after a few games. This is an incredible game. The guy that designs this stuff must have a brain way beyond the average. All of the games he's designed seem to be really fun to play. I need to play more games of this when I can find the time. Our first game sat on the table for 3 months because there wasn't enough time to play the entire game for the first time due to it's complexity. The 3 months happened due to other required things in real life and a chance for both of us to hit the table and push forward with it. I played other games in between. We really enjoyed it though even so. It is an incredible game. Really! Try his other game called "The Gallerist" as well.

Solo Game: Paying it solo is really fun but plays slightly different because you're trying to reach specific accolades to beat Lacerda. Nothing in the game really changes, it's just how you play in order to reach them, so it's great!

This is a beautiful and fantastic game.  I would be willing to play this anytime someone wanted, but I honestly have more fun and feel more relaxed playing Viticulture.  While they fill different niches, I don't need two wine games in my collection.

BUT... it is Lacerda.  Production value is through the roof, and I may have to put it on the shelf anyway.

RATING: 10
Pros:
- very thematic
- the game flows elegantly (slightly less than The Gallerist)
- exciting breath of experts in the wine industry to support the player in his/her journey, which really makes the game feel alive and vibrant
- plays relatively fast (compared to The Gallerist).
- as a 2 player game, I prefer Vinhos Deluxe compared to The Gallerist
- great art and very high quality components
- great feeling of achievement at the end of the game

Cons:
- relatively poor player interaction, which affects game experience when playing as a 3+ players game. To me, this is the single downside that prevents this game from being in my top 3 of all times. The design of the game could encourage players to invest in the same region and boost fame together for mutual gain, similar to The Gallerist. Players could exchange, trade together, workers and experts could move from the land of a player to another's, etc
- as a consequence, not as good as The Gallerist as a 3+ players game.
- no catch up mechanics.
- can feel slightly frustrated at the end of the game as players don't have time to accomplish much (similar feeling to Agricola maybe)

If this game doesn't hit for you and all you have played is the 2016 rule set, I implore you to play the 2010 rules and tell me what you think. Using the base rules saved the game for me. The fair is much more clever and creative using the 2010 rule set and the bank, with investing and divesting, adds another layer. Plus, the game isn't as swingy at the end with the multiplier tiles as it is in the 2016 rules. The 2010 rules took the game from average, to good, in my mind.

If you've were ever curious about Vital Lacerda's games Vinhos Deluxe Edition is a great introduction. In addition to the original version of the game, it comes with an excellent new graphic design, off the chart production and a more newby-friendly version: the 2016 Reserve. It's a stepping stone into Vital's ludography.

Vinhos is a great game about wine making in Portugal. Every mechanism is informed by theme, which makes it smooth to learn and also easy to remember. I really enjoyed the way the wine is produced and how it values as it ages.

It's complex, not complicated. You'll have a great time.

Tried the reserve 2010, like this game a lot. Will going to try the 2016, and play more with fren. 
the gameplay we only make 12 moves, but it really squeeze our brain. Specially the 2010 reserve the bank really kill our cash flow. 

Will go look more other vital game after this VINHOS ~

Update:
Tried 2016, you cant play 2016 with the 2010 concept, you will run out the money and waste your turn. Like the both version mechanism, it like different gameplay. I would say i love both version.

This comment is only for the 2016 Vintage version of the game.

2016-10-31

Initial rating: 7.5 (October 2016)

I love Vinhos, I think it is a tremendous game so I had to back this new edition of the game on Kickstarter. The game arrived this month so I played it right away!

I was surprised to find that there were two different versions of the game (I never read the KS updates or the game description). I don’t know why they did this if the game was already great but if I can play old Vinhos with this new edition I don’t care much about it, however, now I find that even if I want to play the 2010 edition, there are some changes in the rules. I still don’t know what those changes are, but I’m worried about it because I sold my old edition of the game when I bought this deluxe edition.

It bothers me that a clear inventory of the expansions wasn’t included in the box, so when I was doing the initial inventory, it was hard to tell which piece belong to which expansion (I don’t know how to tell the experts apart if I mix them by mistake). The insert of The Gallerist was perfect for the game, but here, it doesn’t work as well. Storing the game wasn’t as obvious as with The Gallerist and the board is loose inside the box and that can cause damage when transporting the game. To conclude this part, I’m disappointed that the insert isn’t very functional, storage isn’t obvious and there is not a clear inventory of the expansions.

I’m also confused about the old expansion Vinhos: The Advertisers, is it included in this deluxe game? I think so (as part of a new expansion) but I’m not sure. 

The game´s components are very good, they are sturdy and of good quality. It also comes with good player´s aids. The game box is very big (it has the same size of The Gallerist). The art of the game is ok I guess. I liked much more the art found on the 2010 edition :/. Besides that, the vineyards and the wineries look very similar and are hard to tell apart quickly.

The theme isn’t exciting to me, but it doesn’t bother me either.

The game has many rules, you can explain them under 20 minutes. They aren’t very complex, but there are lots of them to teach. Playtime is around 3 hours.

The Vintage 2016 edition of the game is less complex than the previous edition but the decisions remains meaty in this edition as well. It keeps the core of the game but adds/subtracts many characteristics of the old game.

Some of the changes between editions are:

•	A ninth region has been added to the game, I’m neutral toward this change, I need more plays to see if it bothers me or not but my gut feeling says it doesn’t.
•	There is a new character you can hire (the farmer). I’m not sure if this makes the game better or not.
•	The fair works different than before, now it is easier to understand and much simpler, but the experts and the four characteristics are much less important than before, so I dislike this change. There is much less strategy here and tactics replaced it :(. This is the change I dislike the most.
•	It added action tiles and multiplier tiles to replace the manager actions and the magnate multipliers. Now it works very similar to the tiles on The Gallerist. I also dislike this change.
•	They removed a whole action, the bank, and in its place they added a repeat action (vineyard action). I also dislike this change because I feel the bank action was important and now you get the money instantly. You don’t need to plan how much money you will need but due to this, the game is much more simple in this regard. In the old edition money was much more harder to manage. Besides that, getting new vineyards is easier in this edition as you have two action spaces for it.
•	The zero weather tile was removed. I’m neutral toward this change. Now you know the weather will have a definitive impact in the current turn.
•	Added solo rules which is neat for players who like to play by themselves, I don’t so I’m neutral toward this change.
•	In this version you begin with only 2 barrels and, a big part of the game, is to get more barrels to sell or to get VPs from the multiplier tiles and export market.


After this list, it would seem I dislike the game but that couldn’t be farther from the truth. I really like this new Vinhos. Its core remains the same (how you choose your actions in a 3 x 3 matrix and how movement through the matrix can cost you bagos or not), the decisions remains hard and interesting (should I buy a new vineyard/winery?, if so which one?, should I sell?, should I export?, which wine should I present at the fair?, when should I present the wine at the fair?, which reward to get at the fair?, which multiplier tile to take?, should I hire a enologist/farmer?, should I build a cellar?, how can I best use my limited supply of barrels?) , you need to plan your actions and movement carefully, in the fair you need to balance the need to go first with the rewards of going last and you need to do all of this with very limited actions (only 2 per year during 6 years). Besides, my dislikes don’t matter much because I still can play the old edition of the game included in the Deluxe Edition, that was great thing to do :thumbsup:.

Bottom line, I love Vinhos and I really liked this new edition of the game. It plays very similar than the previous edition but I’m rating it a bit lower than the original one to reflect that I prefer to play it over this one, but the 2016 deluxe edition is a good game in its own right. It doesn’t really matter as both editions are included in this deluxe edition :D. Vinhos Deluxe Edition will never leave my game collection. This edition is superior to the old one in every regard but the art. I really miss the old art! I need to see what were the changes in the 2010 Reserve Edition of the game.

2017-02-13 - I've only played by the 2016 rules, but I enjoyed this game. There's a lot of strategy, and it played surprisingly quickly for a heavier game. The theme doesn't really appeal to me at all, though, so I don't think I'm likely to pick it up.

Initial rating of 9 based on a two player game (2016 version). It's not nearly as difficult as the Gallerist, but it is lacking the cool interaction. Nevertheless, it has solidified Vital Lacerda as one of my top 5  favorite designers. Excellent game with a beautiful production. Looking forward to playing again soon!

After more plays of the 2016 Special Reserve and one play of the 2010 Vintage, I think both versions of the game are very compelling. The 2016 version feels more relaxing while still providing difficult choices, and the 2010 version is really tight with a very interesting bank system. I think I prefer that way that the 2016 version handles the Wine Magnates and Wine Fair, but both systems are intriguing. Lovely game!

Initial thoughts on the 2010 Reserve, which was a first play for me? First off, we played poorly. None of us concentrated adequately on building out our estates early and we were all pretty starved for money and actions as a result, especially when on turn 5, with bad weather, only one of us could produce more than one wine (and yes, that player won). I don't think it is fair to judge this based on a poorly played learning game. Overall, I thought the mechanisms were interesting but I agree with the critics who say that the game lacks opacity. Paths to development and points are all very clear once you grok the mechanics and there is minimal change from players bumping into each other. Yes, players can claim spots ahead of others, but there are usually decent 2nd options available in most cases. I could see games quickly falling into familiar patterns, which could make it less interesting. I do want to play this version again now that I have a better understanding of the arc, but ultimately I think I'll need to like the 2016 Reserve a bit more than the 2010 for me to keep this game longer term. It will be interesting to see differences, for sure.

The rules are very intimidating at first and it took me a while to get through them. Once I just decided to play it, I definitely needed to reference the rule book often, but it became much more intuitive once I got started. It is the most-referred-to rule book I have ever used, that's for sure as there are so many details. I have two solo plays now and really enjoy it!

Update: I love this game - my new second favorite!

I had heard mixed opinions about the prospect of a more streamlined Vinhos, but my fears were alleviated a couple rounds into my first game of the 2016 Vintage. As Lacerda games go, it's incredibly easy to teach, even to those just dipping their toes into heavier games. Very enjoyable trying to juggle different improvements for your winery estates and also trying to keep up with other players at the wine fair and shipping wine for points. The gameplay is pretty simple, you have 8 possible actions and you take only 13 main actions throughout the whole game, but it adds up to create a wine production engine that ramps up really fast. Love heavier games where simple actions add up to a more complex whole. I'm glad the game comes with both the 2010 and 2016 versions in the box, looking forward to many more plays of both versions of the game. The 2016 vintage in particular joins Le Havre as a great option for a gateway into heavy games.

They took the old Vinhos, which was a great game, and streamlined it slightly.  The result is a less fiddly and more elegant game which captures all of the theme and most of the depth of the original but plays smoother.  After playing both, we'll probably play the new rules every time now.  The production value is excellent but on the downside, I really wish the box was smaller as this format is really obscene on shelf space.

This is now my new favorite heavy game.

It took a couple of games to get the hang of the mechanics, but when it all comes together, its a fairly simple to learn and yet very deep experience. Lots of subtleties in strategy. Competition with the other player is present but not spiteful, but there are definitely some battles to be had in getting control of the export markets and in the wine fairs.

This game doesn't feel 'punishing' in the sense of Agricola or Le Havre where there is a forced feeding mechanic. It just has a very nice feeling of building an engine.

Theme and production quality add to the experience as well.

Will not be selling this one.

Great just great. Perfect theme,  Great atmosphere, beautiful looks, excellent component quality, great strategy thinking and tactics involved (you can aim for different goals). And we just love the production phase.

And hopefully great replayability because of the stretch goals and of course the Reserve 2010 Edition is also included. Worth every penny! My best rated game yet!

The storing and inlay is perfect. It is pretty easy to store it and that's why the setup time is really quick. Don't understand the complaints about the inlay. It is really easy to put everything in there?!!

Takedown time (one person without rush)  9.5 minutes 
When more people are involved and know the game the setup time will be easily reduce to almost 5 minutes. Cannot understand the complaints? For a 2h+ game the setup time is

Played once (2016 version). The game has a lot of moving parts, but they're not as complexly intertwined as in the other Vital Lacerda games I played - and that's a good thing as far as I'm concerned. The end bonus tiles are very swingy and I don't know how much you can mitigate luck in that aspect, otherwise a fine game with a good and well-implemented theme.
After second play: feelings more or less unchanged. We did note a rules error we made in the first game about the purple (end bonus) tiles, now at least they all come into play at some point. But the differences in value still seem big. Otherwise, fine game but a bit long.

Great game, probably a favorite that tried in 2017. It has only 13 actions, but when you get going, then it sprawls into 2-3 actions in half a year. The game can be punishing as you run out of money very fast, but without money you might not be able to do any actions.

All of the Vital goodness that we love! Deep, crunchy game with high quality components. I personally rate The Gallerist slightly higher than Vinhos, as I would almost always pick playing The Gallerist over Vinhos, but Vinhos is a fantastic game that just barely gets beaten out by my favorite Euro game.

RATING: 8
The 2016 version is a great straight forward middle weight euro. It is much harder to explain than actually play as everything is so interwoven. 

My rating is based mainly on solo plays as I haven't played it multiplayer enough. But I enjoy solo gaming and this as a solo game is good fun. 

Discussing the wine theme. Overall I think this is a better game then Viticulture, but I would still rate Viticulture the better solo game.

A very good Lacerda Game. Slightly inferior to Gallerist but only inches away from it. For me the topic is the tie-braker - the Gallerist inspires me more than bottles of vine. But that may be the other way round for you. Play both and be happy :-)

Probably the best wine game out there. 

For me it's a better experience than the competing wine game Viticulture, where, by card randomness, there's a risk that you'll never get both red and white grapes in a game. Vinhos does not have that problem. 

Vinhos new simplified rules makes it easier to introduce the game to new players.

Kickstarter. Signed and numbered copy (818 of 1000).  Received 10/15/16.

Beautiful game.  This game has a ton of difficult decisions each round, as it never seems like you have enough time to do anything.  I enjoy that the period between wine fairs decreases (very Agricola-like), which increases tension towards the end.  The box also comes loaded with replayability, given that there are two versions of the game (2016 and 2010), as well as a handful of expansions.

The only real downside is the setup.  There's a lot of sorting / counting out components, and a good deal of randomization that has to be prepared.

I find this really satisfying as a heavier alternative to Viticulture. It does get a little bogged down in iconography, and I'd hate to even attempt to play this without watching and rewatching various runthroughs online.

This one is really aimed at those who want to think deeply and crunch those numbers with everything geared toward maximising your endgame victory points. I fit into this category, but Vinhos can be punishing for those who are looking for a more relaxed, thematic experience over the super-serious scramble for points.

RATING: 10
There is something to be said about a game designer who avoids the typical themes of medieval farmers or adventurers questing in a fictional land and instead opts for lesser-known and even esoteric topics but still manages to make the experience engaging. Not only that, but Vital also succeeds in matching the theme to the mechanics and design. Whether it's managing an art gallery or manufacturing cars in Japan or lessening the effects of climate change, Vital Lacerda's games are some of the meatiest, heaviest games for four players. And it will be the highlight of your week. True, his games fall somewhere between a victory-point Euro and an economic simulation game. And they may not be for the casual gamer. They will take some of your time to play and learn (maybe even a gameplay video or two), but they are truly rewarding experiences for the brave. While Vinhos doesn't have the intuitive design Co2 or The Gallerist possess, you'll still marvel at the design and how excited you can be at aging caskets and selling wine at fairs. While there are only six action spaces, almost every move is beneficial, and the game isn't lethal. At a glance, Vinhos seems complex due to the overwhelming number of cardboard and bits; it may induce some worry about analysis paralysis. There are so many icons and symbols littering the board! But I learned that Vital tries to make his games language-independent and more intuitive during gameplay; that is, it relies on hieroglyphics and puts the entire rule book on the board to help players. I will admit that Vital's games definitely take a time or two to really understand the engine and beauty of the game itself. Still, I admire the care and thought that went into the artwork, the components and the way the game runs. Every turn is critical and, at game's end, I know where I went wrong. I think the mark of a good game is the thought, "If I just had one more turn..." And this was unanimous at the table. The final scores were close, the difference between first and last place was a measly six points! Like the rest of his oeuvre, Vital's games are some of my most treasured games on my shelf and I'm very happy to have them in my collection. Vinhos is a brilliantly designed and fun journey into the world of wine-making and vineyard management.

4 Plays - Originally, put this as an 8 but moved it to a 9 after multiple plays. This game works on so many levels - too many to put into this comment. Despite having quite euro / mathy aspect to it, the theme does really come through quite strong. The only time the theme is broken (imo) when you're discarding wine from your cellar for ability tiles.

Very similar to the original version with an additional way to play. I have only played the standard way, thus my comments exclude the new version, but I hope to play that soon. A lot of intricacies to get to know on the first play, so do not expect to have a smooth game at first (nor a short one), but there is a lot of potential here. The game looks great and you need to not only produce high quality wine, but manage your actions and your bonus actions. Player order is also important and can be somewhat controlled. Well worth playing several times.

The revamp 2016 edition super deluxe. It is awesome. I never played the original and I have been told MANY times that I need to play the original. I hear it is the more "tight" game. Based on what I know is the new rules and I like this game a lot. Great choices and wonderful color Scheme, even with no "red" worker for me to play. If you like heavy euros this is one to try out. Works very different than the other BIG Wine game of Viticulture and Tuscany. Both are great. Probably my favorite title from Vital Lacerda. Solid game and will happily play when requested.

EXPECTED: After playing Great Western Trail I decided that big heavy euros were not as intimidating as I thought and the kids actually liked the gameplay of the heavy euro which included less conflict but still very engaging. I wanted as BIG and HEAVY as I could find but still have some theme so I looked at Vital Lacertas "Vinho's". 

IN REALITY: This game was close to perfect for what I wanted. My kids were engaged as was I. Heavy to me is complexity and this game is very strategic offering many different ways to play. It is sophisticated in its management of mechanics while still yielding to its theme. Great game!

Jan 2015: I still like the look of this game but I am beginning to feel it might fade on the wish list. Just moved from 'must' to 'like' on my desire ranking.

Oct 2015: It is now 'thinking' and reality is I probably won't buy. I don't have enough heavy-gamers around me.

Feb 2017: If I acquire Vinhos, I want the Deluxe Edition. I think getting two games in one - one being a learning version - is superior.

June 2017: We saw a KS version on Amazon for retail price and they only had a couple. Bought. Can always let go if it doesn't connect.

Comments on the 2010 version: The definite virtue of this design - the simple surface actions rippling forward into significant long-term effects - also means that it's not clear to me at this point how much replayability there is. At two plays I've see more variety than seems immediately obvious based on the simple quadrel structure, but the essential question of "will this have the lifespan you expect in a heavy game" is impossible for me to answer without several more plays.

I've played this once 3-player, three times 2-player and once solo (all were the 2016 version). It's probably up there with Vital Lacerda's other great games. I hope it's not premature to score it a 9.

[EDIT: I have marked this down from 9 to 8 after my third two-player game. With a competitive opponent, the mathy element of the game escalates and becomes quite brain-draining.]

This is a mechanically intelligent game with subtle nuances and nice 'soft' interaction that can momentarily become brutal.

Almost every move involves pushing your luck somehow. If you're playing very 'safely' you aren't being efficient enough :)

Set-up isn't short but there's no fiddly bookkeeping during the game.

Unlike in Kanban and The Gallerist (the other Vital games I've played), there are no hidden player goals/cards. Players know what all the other players have (except for a couple of very minor exceptions, if players choose certain upgrades). This makes Vinhos very tight regarding calculating what moves to make.

Whether you like its tightness and slight mathiness will strongly influence how much you enjoy it. Fortunately, you don't know what cards are coming up in the stacks, so there are always surprises and you always have to adapt. It isn't chess. Also, with multiple plays a lot of that thinking becomes intuitive and it relaxes a bit.

You have plenty of options each turn and you can be a bit creative with your tactics. Opportunities to block or otherwise frustrate your opponents are a fun part of the process. There are definitely multiple paths to victory and players can also win by pursuing a blend of goals at once. It feels very balanced.

There's a luck factor in things like drawing weather/vintage tiles, but it can be mitigated a lot with planning. Periodically chasing new random objectives does make the game much more tactical than strategic - although better players might disagree, for example if they are especially good at lining-up for specific endgame bonus tiles.

There is downtime but you don't really notice it because you'll be glad to have the time to fret about your next move. And you can plan your next move(s) in advance, unlike in some otherwise good games. Frankly, it's fun watching your opponents sweat (and they will sweat!) I've not tried it with 4 players, but 3 players felt like a sweet spot.

Each game will definitely be different. Each starts with players having different bonus abilities. The fantastic extras in this Deluxe edition give many choices during set-up (a two-sided board for two completely different versions of the game, options to include different kinds of vineyards, options to make tourists and cellars a bigger factor etc). 

Thematically it's strong. You will treasure the barrels of wine you get and fret over the diverse ways you can use them. It has that lovely Vital Lacerda motif of gently mocking industrialisation/capitalism - for example with how wine's financial value t you can become very different to its actual quality.

There is a trivial design flaw with the vineyard tiles which means that players in certain table positions can often see what vineyard colours are lower down in the stacks (giving them a very small advantage). I fixed this by putting a light-blue stripe across the top of each of those tokens using a paint pen (and sealing it with matt varnish). But I'm a bit obsessive like that....

Until I'd played Vinhos Deluxe (2016) I thought Kanban was my favourite Lacerda game (and one of my favourite ever games). Now I think Vinhos is. Kanban is more brutally interactive and that naughty aspect is really appealing. Kanban also has a lovely baked-in way or restricting game length with more players. But Vinhos has more options and a greater sense of freedom. Plus, the lack of hidden player objectives in Vinhos makes the tension more immediate.

Drink up!

These comments apply only to the Vinhos 2016 vintage version of the game, my comments on the original game can be found here: [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1150650/dedicating-my-first-review-my-favorite-game-vinhos]here[/url].

[u]The Positive[/u]
(+) Beautiful components which have gotten a serious upgrade over the original version. Still, I preferred the more nostalgic colorful style of the old game board, but of course that's a matter of preference.

(+) The new version is easier to explain and play: serious simplifications mainly involve dropping the bank action (only cash money) and simplified fair mechanism (with less point conversions going on).

(+) The new edition involves 13 in stead of 12 actions, and with more property space, more starting capital and more powerful actions (in which you can often buy 2 things in stead of only one in the original version), players are up and running more quickly compared to the original edition.

(+) The Kickstarter edition involves some additional mechanics like tourists, farmers, special cellar, special vinyard fields, extra regions, some additional experts, ... all increasing variety. 

[u]The Negative[/u]
(-) Simplifying the bank mechanism and the fair mechanism came at the cost of making the game a little less interesting. In the previous version managing your finances was more challenging (in a good way: with opportunities for loans or investments and optimizing the actions spend on obtaining cash). Also, the fair got resolved in a more exciting with with a blind bid which has dropped out of the game entirely. The additional actions provided by the original game based on connections with jury members of the fair offered more flexibility and generated a better level playing field for all players (this mechanism has been replaced with obtaining additional actions or end of game bonus point tiles).

(-) Previously the 4 aspects (smell, taste, alcohol %, color) were tracked in a more 'stable' way - chosing the right experts to promote your wine on the fair has gotten more chaotic.

(-) The additional gameplay elements (farmers, tourists, regions, ...) are nice to haves and do open up some tactical paths, but overall their impact on the overall gameplay experience is very limited. They do not dramatically change the game as a whole.

[u]Conclusion:[/u] 
Vinhos 2016 vintage edition offers a more accessible version of what is an absolute masterpiece of a game. Except for the board which feels a little bland for my taste, the components are top notch and a joy to play with. The game has gotten a little more streamlined with some pretty radical changes to the way money handling, fair resolution and obtaining additional actions takes place, making it easier to explain and play the game. Unfortunately, this came at the cost of giving up some of the exciting and challenging gameplay elements which added to the unique and wonderful flavor of the original game. Efford has been made to compensate for this by adding some extra gameplay elements like farmers, tourists, extra regions, special cellers, ... but those do not compensate for the loss in strategic and tactical opportunities related to simplifying some core mechanics. For this reason, I much prefer playing the original version of Vinhos over the new edition.

Luckily, the original edition is also present in the Deluxe edition and this one is of course as good as ever and benefits from the beautiful components. The only consideration potential buyers must make is whether the additional purchase price (about 3 times as high compared to the original version!) and the additional storage space for this way bigger box is worth the significantly upgraded components and the additional bells and whistles...

Solid Euro. Prefer this one over Lisboa.  Theme is really well integrated.  The 4 step conversion of wine quality to value to fair points to Vp is Euro meat and potatoes. I like the timing of aging your wines in cellars vs selling them early and when to present your wine - spending a whole action to pass and present early is not a huge penalty (or waiting and presenting for a free action is not a big advantage).  My only complaint is the points from exports and competing for majorities in each column seems totally tacked on and abstract. I’d prefer the focus was just on most money from selling wines, having the highest quality wine in your storage at end, and competing for vp from winning at the fairs, along with vp from endgame scoring rules. Ok, the rules also seem to be incomplete - we could not for the life of us find the description of some of the wine expert abilities. It seems with the development from original to deluxe and trying to include both 2010 and 2016 rules and setup that some parts got overlooked.

RATING: 9.5
The only caveat is that I have only played the 2016 version. That said this is an absolutely stunning game. The artwork by Ian O'Toole is gorgeous. The rules explanation can run long but they get out of the way after the first few turns. Once I've played the 2010 version I may re-evaluate my rating. The only thing holding back the rating is the rules overhead but that may change. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The 2010 version of Vinhos is an incredibly tight engine building game with a lot of tough decisions. I really like the inclusion of the bank in this version. You can use the bank to make investments that will pay off over time, but you'll have to visit the bank periodically to withdraw money. Alternatively, you can divest your investments in order to get a large influx of money at the beginning without spending an action, and then slowly hemorrhage cash for the rest of the game, which you can make up for with wine sales. The bank creates some tough decision points, and makes handling your money much more interesting.

The 2016 version of Vinhos is borderline pointless. All of the changes make it a bland experience with no teeth. You're given so much more money at the start that it's easy to accomplish the things you want to, and your scoring opportunities are limited more by barrels than they are by wine or money. Having an engine building game where your scoring opportunities are largely capped at a certain number that is easy to reach creates an unsatisfying game arc. In addition, the differences between the different kinds of investments have largely been homogenized in this version, which makes many of your choices feel uninteresting and less important. The lack of the bank also removes a lot of the tension on how to handle your money. The wine fair is also a lot less interesting because it is much harder to make up an early lead. In the 2010 version, if you have better experts for it, you can make a big push to pass someone on the wine fair, but it's much more difficult to catch up in the 2016 version.

A quality title, and what one would expect from Vital. I think I most enjoyed how the wine ages over time and becomes more valuable, but you have pressure to sell your wine every year, so it's hard to let it sit there. I found the actions themselves thematic and intuitive, but I seemed to find the tension in finding which ones to select. I'm looking forward to getting a chance to play this again.

A purely aesthetic upgrade that was NOT needed. 

2010 Version: There are a few rules changes and a couple little differences that ARE NOT pointed out in the rules as being different so if you come into this thinking you know how to play...think again. I wish they had spent more time on making the rules easier to read and less beautiful.

2016 Version: We have yet to play and have really no desire to as there was no need to "streamline" the game in the first place.

Expansions: Our next play will include all the expansions. I really don't see them as being needed however as you have so little time in this game to do what you want to that more choices isn't really going to help the game move.

RATING: 6.5
Lots of moving parts that are kind of interesting. I don't think it captures the theme as well as I'd like though. Also, there are some "luck into" parts that really feel non-skill based (such as getting a good color and location for presenting your wine). All of that is minor, but the biggest problem I have is with the lack of barrels that really limit some of your actions at the end of the game. The last few actions I felt like I could do nothing because I needed to keep my barrels for scoring purposes and to be flexible on what I could score. That also ties into the problem of being able to simple count up all the points that you and other players could go for and figuring out where to put the barrels optimally. That type of pure math crunching isn't something I find enjoyable when it is all calculatable in theory. Still decent as a game and something I'd play again, but not unless I'm in the right mood.

tl;dr: why?

This game put [person=12396][/person] on the map. With good reason: it is an excellent, heavy, tight euro. You know, the type of game I usually love. And I love this one.
I have a couple of questions about this version though
- Why do away with the excellent artwork of the previous edition? It looked great, was functional and integrated perfectly with the other games by [company=4303][/company]. This has been replaced by new, fine artwork that has been printed in horrible, washed out colors, in a huge box that doesn't fit anywhere and has a custom insert that doesn't hold the components very well. Why?
- The game has a ton of small extra modules. They are mostly nice and integrate quite well, but none of them are must haves. But why do some of those come with extra bits that replace other bits in the box? You're paying for 2 different versions of the same components. Why?
- Some small things in the graphic design are questionable. Ambiguous icons, missing icons, that kind of thing. Why?
Don't get me wrong, this doesn't do anything do diminish the joy I get from this game, but I'll be sticking to my old edition.

I didn't enjoy Vinhos as much as some of Lacerda's other titles, as it feels a bit skeletal in comparison. But even a Lacerda skeleton is enough to make a thoroughly enjoyable game, and it does have that Lacerda feel. Minimal placement spaces but a lot to juggle. I think expansions could really spice this up for me because it is a wonderful, unique system as you try to juggle your wine production, quality, sales and showcasing.

RATING: 8.4
This is the best from Vital Lacerda, much better than Gallerist for me. Game play is great and quite fluent if no AP people :) and not as heavy as might seem. If I could have only one vine themed game I would chose Viticulture Tuscany Essential Edition, but honestly both a very good top euros with quite different feeling, so both worth having in your collection. Components are great, but what I hate is over-sized box and game insert that looks like taken from other game because components do not have their dedicated places. It is a shame for "Deluxe". Also rule book is not perfectly organised, and has some issues. One more thing there is no markings on the board what regions produce vine on startup, so you have to browse rule book for each region description separately. Later we learned that all 5 value regions produce wine, cheaper regions not. If that was stated in the rules we could save a lot of time.

The new edition of Vinhos is here and it is absolutely gorgeous. I wasn't sold on the new style at first. The original edition was loud, bright and vibrant. In some ways even to its detriment, as this is a heavy game and all that visual noise made it seem even more complex than it already was. One I had the physical copy in hand, all that doubt went out the window. The new edition looks super classy and all of the components are top notch, the chits and tiles are thick and nicely punched. All in all, this upgrade was worth every penny.

There are two sets of rules included. The first is a slightly tweaked version of the original 2010 rules. The other is a brand new game for 2016. It is built from the original rules and about 80 percent of the game plays the exact same way. The goal for this new edition was to make it slightly more intuitive and accessible than the original game and they largely have achieved this goal. The new game is fairly easy to teach and most of the heavy decision making has been exchanged for easier tactical responses.

The most obvious change is in the banking system. All money rewards are gathered immediately. There is no waiting for a sold barrel payment to clear at the bank nor is there a need for planning exactly what amount of money will be needed for the next four turns. It allows you to buy and sell at will, which is a net gain in simplicity.

Unfortunately, the wine fair was also changed in favor of simplicity. Here, more so than in the banking changes, I think a lot of what made the original Vinhos so special has been lost. Vinhos has always been sort of a social commentary on the wine industry. It is a love letter, but also a very cynical look. Reputation is more important than quality, and if you grease the right palms, you can sell swill for premium prices.

The old version of the wine fair allowed you to manipulate the judging. You could commit wine experts on your payroll to alter what qualities the judges were looking for and these "decisions" would carry forward into later turns. It was totally feasible to invest in a specific type of wine and then lean on the judges to comment favorably on it, so it could be scored over and over again. The new system just lets you score tactically by matching your character to whatever color has currently been revealed on the weather tile. This makes the game feel opportunistic instead of strategically guided.

The end game scoring has been cleaned up a bit too. Now, end game scoring tiles are tiles are claimed in a draft instead of being awarded to you by a judge. Again, this is mechanically cleaner and the end result is the same as the original game...Yet it seems that again, a little bit of its soul was lost in the transition. The original rules felt like a backroom deal, I send a cask of my wine to the judge and that judge connects me with contact I can exploit for bonus actions or end game advantages.

The final difference is in the flow. For the most part, either ruleset is equally tight. It's just the arc of the game that changes. In the 2010 rules, you have very little money and are scraping to get by, slowly building up until you head into the final show with big operation. The 2016 rules start players with a big wad of cash, which of course leads to a flurry of improvements being made right off the bat. The money crunch doesn't come until much later, but it certainly comes. Personally, I like the pressure of the 2010 system better than the set-up big and see if you can run to the end idea of the 2016 rules. 

It is ultimately two different paths through the same story arc. You eventually end up in the exact same place, hitting all the same beats, just in a slightly different order. This makes it a matter of taste. I like the feel of 2010 better, but that doesn't really matter as both rulesets come with the game. Just pick the one that sounds better to you and dive in and enjoy one of the best games of the last decade

Was really looking forward to this after playing The Gallerist. Unfortunately, I found it to be relatively boring. In my opinion, there's TOO MUCH going on -- fair points and victory points and bagos and wineries and vineyards and regions and weather and cellars and farmers and enologists and wine experts and magnate actions and magnate multipliers and sales and exports. I get that it's a Lacerda game, and I certainly appreciate how it was all stuffed into a game together ... for me, the game just lacked any real sort of fun.

Szokásos Lacerda összetettség és minőség, bár nekem itt a téma nem annyira jött át. Ettől függetlenül jó szórakozás, megfelelő tanulási görbével. Így mindenképpen csak akkor ajánlott, ha többször is előkerül, kocajátékosokkal ritkább alkalmakra inkább mást vegyünk elő.

Playtested a version in March 2009. Put Richard Breese and the BGG brand and you have a great boardgame. 

TBGGG has many aspects that you would associate with Richard's games: lots of player interaction,  game with definable goals; luck in the form of dice rolling, but with many choices; goals to achieve to maximise your score at the end of the game and the game worked well with 5 and 6 people. 

The games quickly in about an hour and there is very little downtime. 

Another game to add to the list of can't wait games to come out! It will be one of the games I regularly draw on for 6 players in future years as the player interact

Three player version.  Plenty of screwage possibilities - collect all three copies of one of opponent's games :)

RATING: 4
slightly boring, random, depth-less, but a way to pass the time if not for the most STUPID turn order rule. if you are a designer get this simple point: if turn order matters, and people fight for it, DO NOT make it so the winner is first and then play goes round the table giving a free ride to the person on the left of someone who wins. PLEASE. 

aldie should have refused allowing the game to take this theme seeing how mediocre the game itself is.

[i]Posted: 2/10/10, Rated: 6[/i]

I love this site.  I registered back in 2004, and have been coming here faithfully ever since.  My board game collection has expanded to the point where the closet is bursting.  Here is a game about my beloved hobby by [person=134]Richard Breese[/person], the designer of [i][thing=12962]Reef Encounter[/thing][/i] and [i][thing=4099]Keythedral[/thing][/i], two excellent games in their own right.  I'm telling you all of this so you'll know that I wanted to like this game.

That actually says a lot, right?  I mean, you're apt to overlook things that you wouldn't typically forgive other titles.  The board here is [i]busy[/i]: this is a tribute to board games, after all.  There's even a neat "key" on the back of the board, listing the games from which all of the pictures were taken.  The eye doesn't "rest" on this board; instead, you're constantly focusing on different items, and can get distracted from the game.  Worse, it is possible to overlook the tiles.

The game itself is clever, and ultimately simple: as a game publisher, you want to earn the most money -- in this game, points are called GeekGold! -- for your games.  As a publisher-collector, you want to collect sets of games other than the ones you publish yourself.  The theme is well integrated: I like the idea of geeks going "window shopping," but I'm the only person in my family who appreciates it.

I affectionately refer to [person=134]Mr. Breese[/person] as a "bit-head," because his games often have a [i]ton[/i] of components.  [i]TBGGG[/i] is actually a conservative offering in this respect.  It still includes player screens, another favorite device of his.  There are dice which take on the roles of "Geeks," and which are used to acquire games.  The closest analogy I can make is that the dice in [i]TBGGG[/i] are placed like those in [i][thing=27162]Kingsburg[/thing][/i], only here they're not used in combination.  You can also spend your GeekGold (points) to change their distribution, which can mitigate the impact of bad rolls.  Spending your points as currency is an idea which I feel was perfected in [i][thing=46]Medici[/thing][/i], and I'm glad to see it re-implemented here.  Movement of your Geeks also has an impact on determining the start player, which can be very important.

You will be trying to create "sets" of games of the same value.  This is where strategy comes into play: you should always aim for "net positive value" on your acquisitions.  Claiming a game pays its publisher a certain price.  Note: you don't have to sacrifice your own points to acquire that game.  However, if you "buy" a game of value "3," and the publisher earns 4 points for it, then you've lost a point relative to that specific player.  If you have a full set of tiles, then each tile is worth 6 points to you.  Taking that same example, the "3" for which the publisher made 4 points netted you two points relative to that player when played as part of a complete set.  This mindset should be at the core of your every action.  Going first or second can make all the difference in your being able to complete a set.

What remains then is tile placement.  If you always pursue the same strategy of "getting the most for your products," then the other players will be able to correctly guess how to obtain your specific tiles.  Your predictability will enable them to complete sets, and earn the maximum number of points.  I can see several different tactics which could be employed: placing a game in a shop with a break-even "bottom shelf" in order to optimize your earning potential across all stores.  Placing your tile on the top shelf so that if it isn't claimed, then it goes off of the board, and the other players miss out on a chance to complete their sets.  There are even two "blank" tiles which can be used to disguise your play style.

All of these items work together well.  The problem is that the theme isn't very compelling to my family.  It's not likely to make it to the table very often for these depths to be explored.  I think that [i]The BoardGameGeek Game[/i] represents a fantastic tribute to our hobby, and has a clever design by a renown developer.  Ultimately, though, it doesn't hold a wider appeal, and that limits its success.

Light set collection game where you are a game publisher trying to sell your own games and buy the games of the others. The trick is to get complete sets to maximize the bonus points. There are some interesting decisions to be made regarding placing your games in the shops and moving your geeks around to score the best deals. When reading the rules I thought this would be a total luckfest. After the first play this does not seem to be the case. Takes a bit long for a light game but this could be due to inexperience of the players.

I went in expecting a light, fun game almost similar to a party game thanks to the reviews I read. Unfortunately, the rules aren't quite that light. It takes a couple rounds before everyone catches on to how the game works. The problem with this is that I'm not sure there's much strategy in this game, so it doesn't seem to justify the somewhat confusing rules. Obviously it's not completely devoid of strategy, but it seems somewhat hard to find. I mean, why not always sell for the highest prices? And can you ever wait for the price to go down on a tile? Not really, because it might be gone before the next round, or you may not roll the necessary number to go after it. And, at least in our 4-player game, it seemed too easy to make complete scoring sets. I realize this may change with a full complement of 6 players, but I didn't find the game interesting enough to try again. This game is not great and it doesn't seem to lead to enough genuine decision-making.

Set collection game with a boardgame shopping game theme on the top. Each player has 20 tiles, numbered 1-6 3 times each and 2 blanks. You want other players to buy your games from shops to give you GG VPs. Then you are trying to collect sets of tiles. Each tile you collect is worth the printed number of points. If you have one of each colour other than your own, then that value becomes 6 pts each. 

Theres a placing in shops and moving shoppers (dice) around mechanic to spice things up. "Buying" your own games to prevent others making sets is also a valid tactic.

Interesting to play and very simple to learn the rules.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Better than feared from reading the rules.  Sounded like a simplistic set collection game, but deciding where to place your games and your shoppers involved much more tactical thinking than expected.  I'm still not sure it's a long-term keeper, but I'm definitely looking forward to playing it again.

Update:  After second game, still not enchanted.  Of course, I'm terrible at predicting other people's actions, and that seems to be a key skill for this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
What the heck were they thinking with this one? There is absolutely no theme in this very abstract exercise. Just collecting coloured numbered tiles. At no point in the game did I have to look at the theme or think about boardgames.

The only potential target audience would be BGGers here and yet the game is so bad that no geek who likes strategy should find this engaging.

Avoid.

NB the designer geekmailed me to ask me to raise my rating and not be so harsh with my comments. My opinion stands. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Rating after one play and this game needs more plays to figure out is it good or just average. I bought it just for the theme and I thought that game would be a bit more complex. But collecting games is fun and there isn't too many games that try to simulate it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Cute marketing exercise, selling the game to a community of people who like the name of it.

Before I rip the game, it's important to note that the graphics and detail on the images is incredible.  Someone spent a ridiculous number of hours putting together the artwork for this game.  It's really quite impressive.

Unfortunately, they put about 100 times more effort into the artwork than into actually designing and play testing this game.  

Players place tiles fairly randomly, roll to determine where they randomly end up, and randomly lose points having to undo those dice rolls if they get shafted.  

Don't get me wrong -- I love dice games and games of chance, but this one pretends to be a strategy game, so it's a little deceiving.

The decisions about where to place tiles in a window are entirely pointless, because giving another player +1 or +2 points in a 5 or 6 player game is such a miniscule consideration that it's almost not even worth the brain activity to think about.  The "decision" becomes entirely automatic.

The scoring is poorly thought out too -- it comes down to entirely who has the most sets.  If you get unlucky enough to get beaten out on a tile, or unlucky enough to be collecting what other players are collecting, you lose.  

The algorithm for what to choose can be described by:  "Can I easily get a 6 tile?  No?  Then what am I collecting?  2s?  Ok, am I lucky enough that someone has put a 2 out there?  No?  Then I lose."

So overall, one of the most disappointing new games of last year.  No desire to play this ever again.

A bit of a puzzle. A good game in many ways, some clever mechanics, nice production qualities and an engaging (if slightly incestous) theme. Even so after two plays I don't find I'm itching for a third. Possibly it's the sense of randomness that puts me off. I won the first game but came last in the second. I'm not sure I could tell you what I did right or wrong in either and none of the other players could offer any more insight. Possibly we're missing something but I get the feeling we might not be.

A really cool collectors item if you love BGG, but not so awesome as a game.  Basically, it's a simple set collection game where the players set the prices of items that the other players need to collect sets.  You hope your items sell high, while also trying to get bargains for yourself to make your own sets.  It all sounds kinda cool, but I ultimately didn't find any of the choices to be at all interesting.  I'd probably rate it lower if not for the BGG tie in.

Nothing really to write home about. It is certainly not a bad game and could be talked into it on occasion. I won't be adding it to the collection though. Also, while the theme may be nifty for someone who frequents here, the whole idea of a BGG themed game just reminds me of the crap loads of Monopoly versions out there. Hell, why not a BGG Monopoly while we are at it that uses geek gold as currency?

When I heard the rules, the game sounded inane. But it started to click on round two. Unfortunately, a couple of us didn't really understand the final scoring rules (each unique color-number tile can only score once, not in multiple sets, and not as individuals). Oops. I liked the game enough to try again, knowing the correct rules, and having my head a little better wrapped around the strategy. But the game got mostly groans from the other players. Pity. Still happy to have my avatar on the box. Woohoo!

Dec 2009 - Played first 5 player game.  Very interesting set collection game.  I could stare for hours at the various art elements.  Theme is an outstanding selection.

Lots of things to do in this clever shopping game with a fabulous theme (and great designer). Where to sell? To shop? What to buy? How to get GeekGold and keep others from getting it? Tense decisions but fast-moving. First play everyone says, "Oh, I see!". . ."Well, but then. . . hmm. . . this is interesting!" And then there are the salesmen personalities, the sneaky sellers, the saboteurs, the disappointed shoppers, etc. So, it's a fun experience. Can't wait to play it again.

Players represent both a game publisher, as well as a game collector.  They put their published games into the six available game stores, as well as try to purchase sets of games from the other publishers (i.e. players).  Very simple game of set collection and bluff, takes about 2 minutes to explain and an hour to play.  Victory points are tallied based on your published games that were purchased by the other players, as well as games you've collected by the end of the game.  Nice effort, very affectionately done, and has good cross-over potential for non-gamers.

I never really jumped on the 'media' 'bandwagon' with this one and it was such a small ripple, I figured I was correct in staying clear.  Afterall, my Avatar isn't even on the box.

But, a friend brought it over the other night and I was very pleasantly surprised.  

It's not earth shaking, but it holds its own.  

There is some 'randomness' in the roll especially if you rely on a 're-roll', but I see the 're-roll' as a somewhat 'mulligan' in that it's meant for when you had a 'really' bad roll.  But, in most cases the 'one day' move will get you where you can do something. 

There are some interesting choices between trying to get points for tiles versus trying to get your tiles to 'age' off without scoring you points while depriving others of a set.

The timing of movement can led to a quick calculations and assumptions of what others might want to try.

I'm not biting at the bit for another game, but I doubt I'll shy away from this game.  It's fairly easy to teach and seems to play well even at 6.

A light set collecting game.

There are 6 turns in the game, and in the first 5 your warehouse receives a stack of your company's game to distribute to different stores.

Next, some or all of your games may be distributed to one of the six stores (players decide in turn order, placing 1 face down counter in the appropriate store - each store only accepts a certain range of games)    After all players have passed, play moves to the next phase.

Next, each player rolls 3 dice, which are used to represent buyers.  The pips determine at which store these buyers will go.

Following this, each player may spend 1 gg to move one of his die to an adjacent store, or reroll 1 die.  After all players have passed, play moves to the next phase.

Flip all face down tiles, then player with the lowest die/dice total goes first, by placing one of his die on a game in the store the die is located at.

Once all die are placed, players receive (for free) the games they have selected, while GG is given to the player selling the game.  Essentially you are giving points to the other player, but at no cost to you.

After the 6th round, players tally up their bonus score.  For each set of tiles they have collected of a given number (set = 1 copy of each game in the numbered series).  Points = number of tiles in the set x 6 (duplicates are worth nothing).

Non-set tiles are worth the number (1-6) listed on them.

Played a couple of times now and still not sure what to make of this game. Seems too "involved" for a "family" game, but not "meaty" enough for gamers.

Wouldn't refuse to play the game again, but wouldn't suggest it. So saying, looking forward to my next game just to try another tactic I have thought of!

JUN10 6 player game with moderate gamers, most of whom had not played the game before. Much better 6 player than 3 or 4 player as I had played before - tougher to make sets and more tactics, especially around being first player. Moved game up a notch.

Initial Rating: 4.5 (April 2014)

I had so much hope for this game. It is from one of my favorite designers and the theme is about my favorite hobby, what could go wrong? A lot it seems. I’m sorely disappointed with the game :cry:.

My cooling toward the game began when I read the rules. They aren’t very clear in the first place, but from them I saw that the boardgames don’t play any relevant role in the game. I was very sad about this. The BoardGameGeek Game is theme less, you don’t feel ANY theme at all :cry::cry:. That’s a shame because I have loved every other boardgame themed game (Ludoviel, Time´s Up Geek Edition, GiftTrap Geek Edition). In the game it is not important which title you buy, only the numbers. This could have been an abstract and it would be the same game.

The gameplay is too shallow for my tastes, very easy/obvious decisions each time and lots of uncontrollable luck with the dice (I know you can advertise and promote). I suppose the game has some hidden depth but it is so boring no one in my game group want to try it again. Perhaps it is just right for families, but then the boardgame theme makes no sense. I thought this was a very niche game for boardgamers but most boardgamers would find this too easy and boring.

I really liked the game board and the methods to choose the first player are very neat too. The insert is genius and I would have loved to participate in it but in 2009 I wasn’t aware of this world. As a homage it is great.

Bottom line, a very disappointing game. I have come to expect brain burners from Richad Bresse, so the shallonewss of The BoardGameGeek Game is very off putting for me. I will sell my copy of the game if I can.

The rules are clunky and the game play fairly arbitrary. While I find that publishing a game to celebrate our beloved site's 10th anniversary is a fabulous idea, it would be even better if there was any reason to ever play this game more than once. The game is a novelty and plays like one.

Looked forward to this a lot. Read the reviews when it came out. Sounded like there really was not much of a game here. BGG offered free worldwide shopping during their 10th Aniversary so I got a copy.

Turns out my initial view was correct, not much of a game here. Very simple game play and not much to do.

It is however a great souvenir of 10 years of BGG.

The best part about this game is that it's perfectly playable with 5 or 6 players. It's set collection which is another plus for me and it features selling and buying boardgames. So it MUST be at least ok. Unluckily, gameplay is bland with not many options provided. Not much more than a simple passtime with friends but that's not the worst a game can do. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Just horrible. The game is a simple and mostly pointless exercise of rolling dice, and then making decisions that don't matter based on information you don't have. There's no connection between the theme and the game (indeed, the theme is fighting the game at every single turn). I can't imagine anyone buying this turd if it wasn't riding on the bgg brand.

Playing with 6 people the game lasted 2 hours, but seemed to have content for about 30 minutes. There's no arc to the game. You're just doing the same thing over and over again, for 6 interminable rounds.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Definitely not a great game, but it does seem kind of subtle.  There is a lot of guess work in where the tiles you're seeking may show up.  Then the turn order matters quite a bit.  It seems like most games should be fairly close, since it would be really hard to complete more than one set more than everyone else.  It also plays fairly quickly for a game that can handle up to 6.

Still, it seems fairly random, and the decisions are not very interesting enough for a game that takes longer than a half hour (which is where I would like to see this one be).

The main draw for me is the entertaining theme.  Though it is completely abstract, the game theme is fun (for game players at least) and the artwork fun to stare at to try and figure out where you've seen that illustration before.

I thought I had missed the deadline, but my avatar is on the box somewhere!

LIKE:

* Quite a bit of tension and potential screwage situations in the mid to late game.  Early game is about trying to set up the late game but feels a bit boring.
* Must make decisions whether to seek to collect a complete set of low value games to make them high value or just collect various high ones and score face value.  There can be some enjoyable spiteful play here in this aspect.
* Two empty "bluff" tiles definitely add a bit of spice and meanness to the game.  
* This is about as easy as it gets for a Breese game!  Very simple to explain and play (10 minutes).
* Another decision to make that can lead to scarcity is placing your games on the top row so they disappear if not bought.  We didn't explore this option too much in our first game so the person who did came in last since he didn't earn as much geekgold during the game.  Group play will determine what style of play will happen here I think.

DISLIKE:

* Dice roll mechanic for placing your geeks can be frustrating and unequal.  The person who won my first game never had to move his dice as he rolled what he wanted.  He won although I did make up about 8 points on him due to my sets but he was leading before endgame scoring by about 10-12 points.  Could be just from poor play on our parts.  Would it break the game if you just chose one at a time going around the table three times where you wanted to place your geek?  And then charge the 1 geek gold if you want to move after all that?

Devoutly hoping for a retheme.  I love Richard Breese's games, but the theme makes this a no-go for me.  I have more than enough advertising in my life, thank you, and I most assuredly do not want to see ads in my boardgames--even if they're ads for other games.

Yuck.

Bought at Essen '09. Rules are pretty easy. Nothing too geeky there. Fairly "light" for a Richard Breese game. Somewhere between filler and slightly meaty.

Too bad you lose the theme once you start playing. It's basically just set collecting, despite the nice "shop" and familiar "boardgames", and board details.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
As a collector's item, this will probably be highly desirable to BGGers. As a game, this is boredom in a box.

There are two circumstances in which I would play this. One involves a request from BGG's own MisterCranky, because he's a good guy and I can just talk to him without paying any attention to the game. Oh, wait, I already did this. The second involves a request from Jessica Alba, Elle MacPherson and Aisha Tyler, who mysteriously and simultaneously arrive at my place and insist on playing a specially modified strip version of this game that they are really, really bad at. I expect this to happen [i]any day now[/i].

Unless you're the sort of person who counts cards or can remember every play made by every person, the strategy is minimal. No one seems to have any problem collecting three of most every number. The decisive factor will be if you get a couple bargains or a good bluff, and if you do it will likely be largely by luck. It's not that there's no strategy, it's that you don't have a lot of information and there's a tremendous amount of luck in what opportunities you have. You can of course pay to improve your dice rolls.

So you essentially want to try to get number 6 tiles for 4 or 5 dollars, etc. And hope that others pay you 6 for number 4 or 5 tiles. And you pay attention to what other people still need and possibly bluff them.

It's bland and dry and repetitive. Reviewing my comments, I fear that I was not hard enough on this game. If I hadn't played this game with a group of very nice people and thus enjoyed the table talk, I would scrub my brain with bleach so as to forget having played it. It's that dull.

I think I may have blacked out during one turn. When I recovered, I noticed that I had rallied to make the score competitive. But I couldn't remember what I'd done, nor could I remember doing it! This proves--proves, I say!--that the game is luck. Or perhaps that a comatose person would be just as good at it as me.

Played a four player game and it seemed everybody acquired most of the sets.  Apparently, one of the only real impacts were the dice you threw, determining how many spaces you had to move, and how many points you gave others  in choosing their sets.  I found little interesting in the game, really.  A bit disappointed.

After reading the rules, I was not optimistic. I have played more than a 1000 different games so you would think I might have a good sense of a game from reading the rules. Well, here's yet another example that you need to play a game before passing judgement! The simple mechanics come together to deliver an excellent set-collection game with a lot of tension and hard choices. I'm not sure if it will hold up to multiple plays, as the final scoring seems like it may be too similar from game to game, but I really look forward to finding out! **UPDATE** After a second play my rating goes up to an 8. I really like the positioning part of the game. Figuring out how best to maneuver yourself so that you'll have the best opportunities of getting a game you need is fun (for me). I'm still trying to figure out the first part of the game, as I always wind up falling behind and having a lot of my games go unsold. I have some ideas and look forward to trying them out.

Collecting different game manufacturer's game sets. Quite boring. Too long at least.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Fairly simplistic, the margin on getting sets of the lower numbers is better, but if you go heavily into the low numbers, you'll have first pick, so it might be worth trying. If I play again, I forsee more contention for start player. Making a set of 6's is pointless and 5's you don't take much penalty. If you pick up a 6pt game for 6gg, then you wind up staying even with that player and you both gain on the others. This makes the smaller games even more valuable, since you'll gain those additional points on that player, while giving him as little as possible.

If I get a set of 1's for face value, I've given 1 point to each other player. I have earned 30 points.

If I collect a set of 6's. I have have given each other player six points, and I have gained 30.

Counter-intuitively, the cheaper games are more valuable. Granted, there's the risk of not getting a set, but there is the built in advantage of moving to the cheaper stores.

First impression (5 players): The game you must play at least one time in your life if you're a BGG. There was no interest to play it ever again after this first match. The game is pretty repetetive with 6 similar rounds and I wasn't thrilled with the mechanics of it either. Tile laying/buying just wasn't interesting enough.

RATING: 6
Breese's strongest selling point has always been Juliet Breese's artwork, which you won't see here.

This is yet another example of the recent avalanche of games where you play an arbitrary number of rounds without the situation actually developing anywhere. When choosing the shops to move your dice to, some interesting decisions arise based on which tiles you happen to be collecting, but that's pretty much all there is to it.

So bad a game I wouldn't even want to see this again...

Look, if there is a board game carrying the name of our beloved internet site, the least to do would be to honor the site by making a decent game. 

A five-player game lasted something like one and a half hour. The game was repetitive and lacked any tension. The ultimate goal was to get some sets of which we everybody managed to have 2-3. The yspahanish dice mechanism was badly implemented and changing your dice result was ridiculously easy.

The graphics were messy and probably the most fun part of seeing the game is observing the box. I couldn't think of any other reason to own this game than that you may have your avatar in it. A nice way of selling the game, btw...

Tactical set collection game with a very cool theme - you get to sell El Grande for big $! The set collection works well with the blind placement, the ability to somewhat control where your buyers end up and it can be played quickly, but after one game I have a slight suspicion it would be rare to see double digit plays. It's a little too random and really just comes down to who can get the low numbered sets. Gaining points for selling is superfilous as everyone ends up on similar points before sets are scored anyway.

Another game where the rules make more sense after a sample round than hearing (or reading) them.  Once you discover that this isn't that complex a game rules wise, you can start to see how the bits work together.  But the players need a memory to know who is collecting what numbers and who has played what numbers so that one can focus on a complete set or two for maximum points.

Unfortunately, I can't shake the feeling that set collection starts in the first two rounds almost randomly and then one tries to do the best one can against the player chaos to finish those early sets.  This might be a bigger factor with more players.  6P games need 5 games to complete a set in a game lasting only 6 rounds - not much room for error despite the ability to purchase multiple games in a round.

Players spend the first half of every turn of every turn placing tiles FACE DOWN--which eliminates much of the strategy.  Roll dice and place them next to the face down tiles to guess where the tile you need are  (And you need full sets).  Then reveal the tiles and pick them up, receiving VP's depending on which shop.

I'd rather play any of the games depicted in the BGG game than this game.

At its heart this is a set collecting game, the BoardGameGeek theme adds a bit of atmosphere.  That being said, there are different scoring rules for three-player vs. four, five or six.  

As I have played just the three-player so far, will focus on that.  In this, a set of one through six of a single game company (color) is the big point scoring mechanism.  In addition, you can score duplicates so you need to decide early on which color to try and acquire to complete that set.  Your secondary choice is to try to collect a second complete set, or simply focus on the high value games.  In the background is another player deciding to purchase back their own higher priced games to prevent others from scoring them, but denying themselves the geek gold in the process.

At this level, a nice game, not so intense that you can't chat with your fellow players as the game progresses.

Set-collecting with some bluffing and a smidgeon of actual strategy.  Plays in a short time and works with six.  Even the dice mechanic is entertaining rather than completely random.  And the graphics are fun without actually being distracting.  What's not to like?
Well, the theme is virtually non-existent.  And there is a level of randomness that can be punishing - especially with more players. But for a short game (and for goodness sake, don't let anyone fall into AP with this or it will kill the game), I can live with all of that.

Light chaotic set collection game.  It runs a little long for what it is with 5 players.  I'd like to get this on the table with fewer people.  I can't help but feel that the scoring for the selling stage is arbitrary and couldn't just be roll your three dice, that's how many points you get this round.  Ultimately, I'm guessing that it keeps you honest and insures that sets are available and equally distributed.  

I will say that this does a great job emulating the Cult of the New, I like the way that the dice and the stores work, I like the board movement and the excitement of the flip, but I'm just not sure that the rest of the game is all that intriguing.  That said, I'm tired of drafting/set collection games in general, so take that into consideration. 

Perhaps the game would be better if you could see the other sets that people have been working on, then at least you can make some informed decisions rather than trying to card count (blech).

With fewer players the rating may go up, but I'd be surprised.

I'm not sure about this one.  I really like the theme and the board and rich colors of the dice as well as all the images of quality games.  However, I don't feel like I have much control of what is going on, and I struggle to generate a strategy to connect the dots and get points.  I just didn't find this game to be all that much [i]fun[/i].

Great theme, of course, but also a fun set-collecting game in itself. Once you figure out the flow of the game, turns move along fairly quickly; but it does take a while to figure it out! I might prefer playing with open holdings, though; except that may slow the game down too much?

Each player has 20 tiles: 2 blanks + tiles 1-6 x 3. These become available in random order. Each turn begins by putting these into shops; each shop has 3 shelves, with highest price at the bottom. Then, roll 3d6 each and place dice ("Geeks") in like-numbered shops; players may spend GG (points) to reposition their geeks. Geeks then may buy tiles: goal is to collect sets of OTHER players' tiles (own tiles score 0). Players get VP for each of their tiles sold. Unsold tiles move up to higher shelf (or out of game if already at top shelf). Repeat x 6 rounds. At end, score additional VP for sets of tiles collected; duplicates score 0; each tile in a set (=a tile of same number from each other player) scores 6 GG. Each tile not in a set scores face value. Most GG wins.

A fun theme and some of my favorite art work, but underneath the sheen is a game where the decisions just aren't that interesting. It helps to remember what tiles players have chosen and have put out, but that's not interesting to me either. A bonus point for the art work

I don't especially like this game. It depends too much on other players decisions and it seems a bit underdeveloped. I like the idea of the game and love the fact that my avatar (my daughter's picture) is on the box. A must have only because of that.

I want to love this game, but it is a very boring set collection game, only partly redeemed by the theme. Played once with 6 , might be better with less. Set collection + Randomness = little fun

This is an extremely well-crafted tactical game for 4 players, I cannot speak for more players than that, but it seems like the increase in chaos might weaken it a little.  Four is our usual number of players, so it may be awhile before we see more.

The reviewers who are saying the game lacks difficult decision making are just plain wrong...seriously.  They're either playing the game incorrectly, or aren't playing with competitive players.  The decisions are extremely tight in this game since, between competitive players, the scores will vary by only a couple points or so by game end--and differing strategies are hugely important.

Control of start player is EXTREMELY important, and should cost players GG almost every turn for its control.  Placement of games within shops is *NOT* just plop it into the highest value spot and go...there are advantages to each of the 3 positions, and while it may cost you 1 or 2 GG in sales, you need to use that power to cut into opponents' set collection, or at least force them to compete while opening easy set-colelction to yourself.

The memory aspect is there, and important, but no more so than any trick taking card game--even less so really since you can see the relative importance of acquiring certain values based on how people move their geek around.

The theme is icing on the cake--it fits extremely well with the mechanics, and, of course, all the game-art is great to look at.

Played again after a long break, and it's still great fun with 4.  

After reading more poor reviews from people complaining about having to remember, well really about half what you need to remember in a game of Hearts, all I can say is hehe, really that's pretty darn sad.

Retail therapy the game publisher way - as in real life, games publishers double as sellers and avid collectors. Place your tiles to entice buyers, and have your buyers pick up other publisher's games to maximise your geek cred at set-collecting. I find the dice a simple, bright & breezy way of getting all your buyers in the shops quickly, leaving you with the option of living with what you got or tweaking the shops at a cost of VP.

Good to see a 6-player game, light, but with a reasonable degree of strategy, that plays in an hour with negligible downtime

As a loving tribute to a group of artisans and fans, the BGG Game is a perfect 10, filled with game shops, quotes, and personal recognition.  As a game itself, it falls flat; it is devoid of tension, has no arc, and lasts too long by at least a third.  But complaining that the BGG Game isn't as fun as the hobby it memorializes is a bit like complaining that the record player on a Grammy award doesn't play music.  That's not the point.

Played at Essen Spiel 2009. First impression: Good set collection game, although slightly fiddly and not so easy to get the mechanics down. Took us about three rounds (1/2 game) until we knew what we should try to do. (Not so much ruleswise, but as a strategy). We seriously considered buying it, because it plays with 6 players. But we finally decided against it, because we have better games for less players, and if we are six players, there will usually be someone there who plays it for the first time and then three rounds of getting used to it is too long.

To me, this game felt very similar to Reef Encounter in that it forces players to carefully assess A LOT of factors each time they have their turn. For me, that is hard work and I can therefore not really recommend these games to anyone who's prone to AP.
That said, the game clearly has a random element that Reef Encounter does not have. That makes it more enjoyable in my book, but I can imagine that it might work the other way around for other players.
The thing I missed most in our session with six was involvement. It all felt a bit abstract, and I was missing the suspense. Still, I would like to try again sometime with fewer players.

Old-school feel.  One of those very stripped-down euros that just tries to do one thing.  It's not especially interesting, and it's quite chaotic.  It's connection to the Geek is pretty superfluous.  The references to games via the artwork is kind of neat, but it's not enough to keep the game truly interesting.  You can give this one a miss, even if you are a diehard BGGer.

Ok set collection game with a bit of area movement and control to guess where the wanted games are, and to ensure that other players buy your games put up for sale. A but confusing with different numbers everywhere with different meanings.

This is a light, clever little design, where players are trying to maximize profits in this shopfront-type game.  The use of the dice as customers is clever, and works, since it randomizes part of the game, but doesn't lock players in to one particular location (e.g., players can pay points to move the pieces to a different location).  The placements are neat, and gives the game a small amount of tension based on placing their pieces into shops where they're hoping another player will take them, and then there's the timing aspect of when players will take a certain tile in a certain shop.  There are a couple of issues with the design (i.e., when would anyone play a 1 tile to the 1 shop?), but overall, it works fairly well for a light game.  And plus, that theme will certainly draw in the hardcore BGGers.

Learned from Richard Breese at BGG.Con. 

It's a fun, light, set collecting game.  However, since I heard both Richard and Derk say "you need to play this one without AP," makes me think that it is susceptible to AP.  Which, of course, makes it not a fun, light game.

All in all, I'd certainly play it again, but I have no need to own it.

Everything from the pricing of the tile to the worker placement seemed to be arbitrary.  Of course everyone want to sell high and buy low, but is there any reason to put something in the back as opposed to the front shelf?  Sure you can deny other people the chance of collecting their sets, but that also comes at the cost of your own income.  Would probably make it a more interesting game if the purchasing actually come out of your victory points instead of completely free, at least that will make the spending for die movement more meaningful rather than just pocket change.

I really wanted to like this more due to its namesake, but it fell fairly flat for me.

With 6 players, the game can run a little long, but it's hard to "count cards", and interesting to play game roulette, gambling on getting what you need where it looks like it might be.

Urban combat is brutal! And during the succession wars it was no less so. This box turns your Battletech campaign into RAMPAGE. 

Charlie, my beloved friend and gaming cohort, was mired in a city with a heavy lance. His Marauder charged down a street, skidded into a building, fell into the basement and landed on his head. Critical hit to the driver. I remember the die roll. 

Then.

His Awesome was busily clearing the streets of Kurita vehicle traffic, harassed mercilessly from infantry and light mechanized. He knocked down a building to create a shortcut to get a little maneuver space. What was waiting on the other side of the building? A Kurita Demolisher, idling quietly, it's twin AC/20s tracking the action on the other side. I also remember the following die rolls. Hit, head, crit. 

I remember Charlie staring at the board in disbelief while other players cackled. 

Stay out of the cities man.

BattleTech in a city setting. New building rules are interesting but only really useful if you're using infantry. Seemed to bog the game down more than it needed to.

Reglas extras para Battletech. 

Si posees el "Total warfare", solo es útil por los mapas hexagonados.

Feels more like an expansion. But can be played standalone.

Though Battletech is an undisputed classic, this particular box set from the '80s didn't add very much to the game -- mostly just city maps and a few extra mechs, ([i]and some more horrible artwork[/i]) :P

I love the whole Battletech series. I stopped just after Clans started to hit the galaxy. It was becoming too much like Star Fleet Battles...too cluttered with rules and units.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played original version. A new dimension to battletech. The maps that came with the boxed game were crap. Where are the big cities we read about in the rules? We ended up designing our own maps with hundreds of buildings. The new mechs were cool, too. I loved the Hunchback and Spider.

The Battletech expansion that gives you the rules to wreck havoc in urban areas adding the Clan tech, the anti-mech infantry, etc. Per si it doesn't give much, but combined with Battletech it is great.

Battletech with tanks and buildings too.

We got so many plays out of this one gamebox. Mapsheets, vehicle counters, two DOZEN mech miniatures and the only btech box to come with buildings! Yeah, this was an AWESOME buy! With all that said, I've long since moved on from this game but at the time I got this, and plenty long afterwards, this was THE game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A great addition to the Battletech line, with the addition of buildings, and vehicles. However if you want to follow the rules for structural damage on buildings, it means a lot of little notes all over the board on what building has what damage. This would be much better managed as a video game.

Battletech moved into tight confines. Tends to favor one punch kills due to tight maps.

The second Battletech product I ever bought. Good introduction to urban rules, but more importantly it introduces rules for vehicles/infantry/battle armor that is universal throughout the game. The plastic minis included are really awful when compared to the Ral Partha or Iron Wind metal ones, lots of obvious mold lines, little detail, and die-hard BTech purists will probably find a lot of inaccuracies on the minis.
I don't know if FanPro has reissued this or not, although its pretty much pointless since they issued the Master Rules.

Battletech in the big city, with new rules concerning buildings, paved roads, basements, and the new dangers associated with each (buildings collapsing on your 'mech, skidding on a slippery road when you take a corner too fast, etc.).  Great game.

See my comments on Battletech, add some additional complexity, and make the game longer.  While it's fun to blow up some buildings and complicate the strategy/tactics a bit, it just doesn't seem to pay off in the end.  Hasn't seen play in a long time, and really isn't likely to in the future.

My first boxed set! This expansion came with plastic miniatures, rules for buildings, infantry, vehicles, skidding, and so much more. I've played many games with just this boxed set!  Many plays, most before I was a member of BGG! I still like to play BT, but looking for players in my area! I don't like the boxed sets of today, because they've added too many rules that don't make sense! Todays books also add way too much fluff.

I don't understand why the Geek Rating on this is so much lower than for BattleTech.  It's pretty much the same system but with the addition of buildings, which is awesome.

This addition really adds very little. Thoughts of fighting within the cityscape evaporated when it was revealed that buildings rules are nothing more than areas with hit points. Lame.

Expansion to Battletech or stand-alone game. Adds infantry, vehicles, maps, plastic figures for the new mech designs, and more mech customization, and a horde of new options to the game. Most exciting, it added the Clans.

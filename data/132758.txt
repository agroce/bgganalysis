GAME: Fool's Gold
RANK: 2810

RATING: 7
I really enjoyed this one. I think for the theme the group as a whole would play gold west first, but mechanically they are very different. I like going through the card decks 'digging' for gold. Sure it has some luck, but it feels thematic.

RATING: 8.8
A surprisingly good game with a theme that somewhat adheres to the mechanics. Nice graphics, though; but the game might be a moderate challenge for the colour-blind. Remarkably tense with the push-your-luck element, but still plenty of tactical decisions to be made each round: do I pan in the River now at low cost, or wait until I'm certain there will be plenty of cards drawn there? Should I pass and put my workers into reserve at that spot? Or will Ned pass with an even larger reserve? The scoring is reminiscent of many Knizia games and Container. If his other games are like this,  I can't help but wonder if Joshua Gerald Balvin might be the next Great One!

Thematically, Thebes is the better game; but if only Thebes had the digging mechanic of Fool's Gold!

RATING: 5
Set collection and dice allocation.  It plays quickly, is easy to teach for non-gamers, and is pretty smooth.  I haven't played with a full set of 5, but I think that would be pretty fun as the locations dry out.  There's not a lot to it, but it's still fun.

I really like this game. It releases in the late Spring of 2015. I got to play a pre-release copy and had a great time. It's a cool theme, and easy to learn, but it has a cool dice and worker placement mechanic that I haven't really seen used quite this way before.

Worker Placement game with dices and Press Your Luck mechanics. It's a funny Eurogame, pretty nice to play, that has some clever mechanics that make easy for the players to get into the Gold Fever Age ambient. Unique game with awesome artwork.

Here is an example how the mechanics fits to the theme. Nice  medium light game, which awaits for an addon. I enjoy that Digger.

Interesante juego de dados y colocación de trabajadores con una carga de azar importante en el mismo sentido que en el juego Thebas. Es bastante complicado llevar en mente lo explotada que está ya una mina de modo que, aunque te apoyes en la probabilidad de obtener algo bueno en un lugar, te terminas encomendando al azar. La puntuación es original y hace que te plantees ir a unas minas u otras para optimizarla. La producción del juego es sobresaliente.

A really nice mix of worker placement and push-your-luck that recreates the Gold Rush. Beautiful and unusual graphic design evokes the theme without looking old. It's  got a nice arc to it (first you find some gold, then less and less), making it a great example of how to convey theme through mechanics.
I wish more people knew about this one.

Fool's Gold had my 9 year-old-daughter immediately wanting another copy of the game at mom's house and both kids extolling the game's greatness. In this game, players are mining investors hiring miners to find gold and gems in 5 kinds of locations - Rivers, Lakes, Mountains, Hills, and Forests. Those locations are represented by a deck of cards, each with a different ratio of gold cards worth from 1-5 value and gem cards unique to each. Also in the decks are silt (nothing), and two kinds of bad events. You can only take one gem from each location and the bigger the set you end up with the more points they are worth. At the end, you add up all of the gold values and gems and the highest score wins, but in a very Knizian move, the location you collected the most gold from is fool's gold and is worthless. You also get minus points for each location from which you never collected gold.

Why does this work better for me than Thebes? The way that luck is mitigated is not through laborious travels and card draws, but by crafty placement and manipulation of priority. Since multiple players are invested in most draws, you are competing against the actions of other players more directly than in Thebes. It also means that someone can't really "clean out" a location before others can lay claim to some of the value. It's a crafty as heck game from a young designer. I look forward to seeing more of his games. I think this started as a Kickstarter, and I hadn't heard of it before finding a discounted copy on my FLGS's shelf. Glad I took a chance on this one!

A press-your-luck game that is quick to teach and has a good amount of decisions that really matter.  There is a significant amount of luck involved and you can get entirely hosed especially in the last round of the game.  But making the decisions that end up beating the odds is what makes the game fun.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Components are nicely made. Game play is reminiscent of Thebes as far as the digging for treasure component except you dig for treasure in a deck of cards instead of a bag of chits. The product of the dice and the number of miners present at each location determine how many cards are drawn and then people select treasure (if available) from the cards in priority order based first on majority and then place in line. If there is no treasure left, you can choose to either go home and take two coins from the bank to help in future rounds (coins are worthless but help you get more miners out for investment purposes) or lay the miner down for another chance to dig in the winter but you chance getting nothing. I found it quite fun, straightforward and everyone is waiting to see what gets drawn and the accompanying groans or cheers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I liked this better than Thebes, which has a similar mechanic of digging for treasure. There's more going on in Fool's Gold, with more interesting choices. I also like that there's a winter season for mining each round, which helps if you didn't get what you were looking for during the regular season.

What a hidden gem and a pleasant surprise.  Small publisher, and local game designer (Seattle).  Reminded me a lot of Thebes, the same brilliant mechanism of digging for treasures and getting diminishing returns from the same digging site, which is very evocative and a very thematic game mechanic.  Very nice production values, the quality of the components and the art is excellent.  A nice combination of push your luck, worker placement, and competing against others for place and resources.  Little to no downtime, exciting and surprising.  There is room for strategy and tactics.  Easy to teach, quick to play even with 4-5.  Truly a pleasant surprise, the dice are almost misleading, although luck plays a role this is a complete game.

Recommended to me as a better Thebes, I think it delivers. Fool's Gold focuses on the "bag draw" portion but adds a draft, a pullback, and even a sort of double-or-nothing. It's just a numbers game but plays quickly and has some nice interaction.

A Euro 'push your luck' game to rival Thebes. Fun theme, decisions and plenty of luck that could sometime feel like 'bad luck', but it was certainly possible to shore up your odds and was good fun nonetheless.

RATING: 8
As with prospecting for gold, this is a thematic worker placement, speculation game...through and through.  There is a lot of randomization between the prospecting dice, the winter dice, and the decks of cards (the mines) which provide good press your luck...especially in the later rounds.  However, don't think there isn't strategy.  That comes in the form of money management, bidding, and worker placement mechanisms.   However, if you are looking for pure/high strategy, look elsewhere.  Overall, I think it is a good mix.  I also think the mechanisms tie into the theme very well. Also, despite the dice components, I wouldn't really call this a dice game like King of Tokyo, Yahtzee, or the like.  The prospecting dice and the winter die simply provide some input randomness.  I think this game also looks great on the table with its vintage art and weathered look.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]A very average push your luck game that feels like it's over designed based on how light the game actually is. It plays too long to be a filler and the decisions you have to make are extremely simple. You're either getting gold or collecting gems (of which there is only one type for dig site). There is nothing wrong with the game, but it drags on as you keep making the same simple decisions every round while trying to gather the most gold. Even the somewhat clever mechanic of losing all the gold from the region that you have the most gold in feels wasted since it is easy to mitigate the loss. 

While the game is simple the rules are not as intuitive as I want them for a game of this weight. I wouldn't pull this out with family and friends that aren't gamers, but by the same token it isn't quick enough to engage gamers for the whole game. Once again Diamant/Incan Gold reigns supreme when it comes to a simple push your luck game that is engaging and easily taught to new players and still enjoyed by gamers.[/i]

A lot of deck diving and push-your-luck makes this one a bit random, but you always get to see what other players are digging up, so information can be tracked and you can play the odds easily enough. It feels almost cooperative the way players share the excitement of flipping over the loot cards. Scoring is surprisingly tight. I like it.

Played preproduction copy at Essen Spiel 2013 fair. Quite correct, well working euro-family dice/worker placement game. Maybe a bit too long, one or two rounds shorter gameplay would be better. A little dry but there is some tension. Very well edited rulebook. Family gamers could add +1 to the rating.

I had quite a good time playing this little dicey game. Truth is it's not that little, quite a big board but the game is simple and straight forward. Thing is you don't feel like you could ever be beaten by the dice in this one which is pretty cool. You base your mining potential on where the dice end up not the other way around. Pretty cool game indeed.

light game with dice. looks nice.
dice get sorted into areas based on values. then place workers in each area.
reveal cards where x = number of workers * number of dice
so more expensive to move into area with lots of dice but higher reward chance.
some cards are bad.
knizia / tigris like scoring

I enjoyed this. It felt like there was a lot of luck but with a push your luck game that is to be expected and it is still possible to maximise your chances.
But more importantly I found the game to be a lot of fun. The anticipation when waiting to see what is found is nice and adds to this fun factor.

RATING: 10
Really enjoy getting this game to the table. I think some of its rules are a bit nuanced for my non-gaming friends, but they have all seemed to enjoy it, especially when they win! Building up the board is pretty pleasurable and the quality of the components makes play more enjoyable. It's not going to burn your brain, but there are some tactical choices to make and I always want to play again after I get a game in.

It's a neat, tile-laying, set-collecting game, filling a slot for a 30-minute game, which is equally good for 2 or 4 players, and takes very little time to teach, set-up, and take down again. It looks great, and it's not a title you're going to see on every gamer's table, so it has that "I have a unique, little, unknown treasure" feel about it.

On paper, this one sounded an interesting tactical tile placement game with lots of out-maneouvring your opponents to do along the way. And to a certain extent it plays out like that. But the 2 games we played with 3 players, we got into a stalemate situation with no way out until one player was lucky enough to draw the single tile that would break the stalemate. Not very satisfactory, and in the end just a bit boring.

Good abstract game.

Quick and simple tile laying/majority game.

Quick enough to play a second game right after the first one is finished.

Abstracto que al principio parece muy sencillo y azaroso, y conforme se le coge el truco se ven más posibilidades y se disfruta más, bastante recomendable.

タイル配置をして鳩を得る。自分の鳩舎を配置して、得点化する。カルカソンヌのように自分の鳩舎を置いたエリアを拡大していきつつ、相手のエリアを広がらないようにするように配置する。と、同時に鳩を得ていく必要もある。煩雑にならない範囲でマネジメントのしがいがあり、中々面白い。引き運は強め。

Giochino molto bastardo, che ha per tema la caccia ai piccioni e il disturbo degli avversari con i propri falchi. Giocato uno contro uno, è un continuo di colpi bassi.

Played with the designer in Essen 2013 and lost horribly which speaks for the game. [gameid=34707] is the obvious comparison when it comes to the central mechanism of laying tiles and covering parts of previously laid tiles. But Columba is a deeper more abstract game that's best played either with two or with four in two teams. While it's an abstract game, there's still a noticeable luck factor in drawing the tiles that at times could be decisive if players are of comparable skill.
The cards are nicely illustrated, the pigeon stalls are massive wooden towers adding to the pleasure of playing this. The only issue that kept me from buying it is the lack of players in my group willing to play thinky rather abstract games.

One of our Essen surprises this year, didn't have this game on the radar at all, played it there on a whim and loved it. 
Despite the peaceful theme there are many opportunities for mean play. Especially fun in the four-player team variant.

Typically a game that does nothing new. And the old stuff it does, it doesn't it better than many other games we already know. It is just a simple game: take card, score majorities. Slightly more to it, but really not much.

Fairly enjoyable tile-laying game that reminded me of Heartland.

Play cards in an overlapping fashion to claim areas and score VP. So far, reminiscent of the designer's previous game [gameid=27490]. Here, however, there are tactical restrictions and aims - which create opportunities to limit opponent's actions and for clever "extra action" plays.

Provisional rating, one 3p play (at Spiel). Interesting tile-laying mechanism.  Having the final turn of the game can be very powerful If that player holds a lot of "domesticated pigeon" tiles, but there's a risk in playing for that event as someone else may end the game first.

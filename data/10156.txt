Everything I want from a Wargame on the 2nd World War! Simple rules, strategy, tactics, nice length, large scope, great replay value. I won't be needing any other game on the Eastern Front for a long time.   

UPDATE: Yeah of course you won't. That's why you sold this and bought Holdfast: Eastfront 1941-45

I've always liked TRC and this edition does the game justice.

RATING: 9
Love this game!  Actually prefer it to Eastfront.  I think the sudden death victory conditions in this version make TRC much, much more playable than earlier versions.  The short-term goals are really fun to aim for.  Highly recommended, the most-fun hex and counter I've played since ASL!
Ignore the whining from the "supply rules suck" crowd, if you're someone who still remembers that games are supposed to be fun, you'll like it.
Oh and did I say it was fun?

A game that shows it's age.  The new edition is graphically nice though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Endlessly fascinating.  Endlessly replayable, perhaps because it is playable.  You must make right strategic decisions, supported with good mechanical play (aka tactics).  In fact, you have to separate the two functions and approach them in sequence.   Good plans poorly executed come off the tracks in a hurry.  Ditto the reverse.  And must constantly manage risk (the old risk-reward calculus), esp if playing full campaign, which is absolutely best format, but Ruskies must have Sturmoviks, If you're a serious player, you need to play in Gary Dickson's annual ladder event (we're in 14th round), else you're missing a treat.

The Luxe edition of the best "gaming" wargame ever. Same remarks as the 3 edition. Player can now even choose between traditional symbols or tank pictures on their counters. 

You won't touch Axis and Allies again !

The new victory conditions improve a lot a classical game, much better remade with a nice graphic. Strongly suggested if you did like the original edition, this is better 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The components for this game are wonderful with large counters and excellent graphics.  The competitive play and flow from the original game has been maintained with this addition.  The rules have been mostly cleaned up although there still are a few errata, which is a slight disappointment considering this is a 4th edition.  Competitive and tournament play is wonderful with this game.  Very highly recommended!

RATING: 7.2
I got the super-sized update of this classic after playing the original only a few times over the decades (was never a big east front fan, but it's been growing on me lately).  A classic late AH heyday game, with all the attendant nostalgia attached to it.  A WW II East Front game that is in the sweet spot for me on scale, rules, and time to play.  I sometimes wish for one notch more detail, but this would be a minor sacrilege given the game's lineage.  A useful graphic upgrade from Art L. games for aging eyes.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
What a dissapointment AND a let-doun !
This was once one of my favorite games,(of my still favorite subject ); of the 70s and 80s!

Sooooooo much could have been done, and should have been done, that was NOT done, to bring this once great game into the 21st century, that I will look very hard and long at ANYTHING L2 ever produces before risking my $$$$.
They didn't even bring it into the 1980s.

And whats with having to pay even more for an "expansion" that for the high price tag of the re-print,should have been part of the re-issue ?
Don't do it !

Excellent implementation, but I'm one of those heretics who believes the design is obsolete. Emminently playable, no doubt, but superseded in the competition for time and tablespace by more modern systems.

This was probably the game that brought me back to wargaming in 2003. The L2 version is a pleasure to see, the game is easy to learn, fun to play and difficult to master. Also perfect for introducing newbies to the hobby. The ADC version is great for friendly PBEM. Yes, sometimes the rules smell old, but that doesn't mean its a bad smell. Lovely game.

Just acquired 12/2008.
This is an excellent update on the classic Russian Campaign.   I've played it twice so far and both plays have been quite good.  The 5/8 counters are great, the map looks good, and the variety of optional rules are excellent as well (I recommend the battle group rule myself).

RATING: N/A
A great upgrade to the original. It includes all the variants and the expansion does the south justice.  Bigger map, bigger counters.  A must have game for sure.  If I could only have three wargames, this would be one of them. There are many pretenders to the East Front throne, but Russian Campaign still gets it done...play after play after play.  Great job by L2

I finally got a chance to play this game. The quality of the map and components are a tribute to Art and L2. The game was fun. My only complaint is that results are based on a single die roll. That does not provide for much variance. I would prefer a 2 or 3 die roll for results.

One of the best wargames of all time, brought up to deluxe graphic standards.  Beautiful large hexed map with addition of extra hex rows.  Game captures ebb and flow of Operation Barbarossa in a way not equalled before or since.  Extra features makes it a great catch and include NATO and iconic counters, computer version of the game for e-mail play, and great player aids.  Don't miss out!

RATING: 4
A few things about this are not quite what I want (the time/space scale is to course, for one), but what really gets me is Soviet air lift ability for their airborne units -- way to high.  For instance, in one game at the end of 1941 I lost a huge chunk of the cream of the German army to a massive Soviet air drop that would have required more air transport to pull off than the air transport rich Western Allies could have done at their peak.

RATING: 8.5
The new rules use VPs for certain key cities and incorporate yearly player-selected sudden-death conditions. These redress the very few shortcomings of the Avalon Hill original campaign game. And, the more expensive but very nice physical components are a plus for us geezers with weakening eyes. Great online support for PBEM play, and active player pool at BPA WBCs. 

The "Tourney Scenario" at 10 turns long (or thereabouts --- a recent BPA PBEM Tourney used a slightly tweaked version) is good addition, and is a great intro: tense and closely-fought (barring horrible luck), and playable in 3-4 hours.

Yes, I'm biased.  But then, again, who isn't?  This game is easy to learn and hard to master; more importantly, it's fun to play.  While the design is dated, the fact that this game continues to be heavily played is a tribute to some sort of enduring value.  The L2 remake does dial up the 'luxury' but the core attraction continues to be the fact that this game is PLAYABLE.

I want to say that gamers who criticize the supply rules and the factor counting just don't get it.Why, because the supply rules create the proper effect, you can encircle and you want to capture cities.Why, because the randomness of the CRT will counter-act the exact factor fudging, and you now have ?s to hide the values of your stacks if you wish.Keeping it simple and playable and easy to play if you've played it before were the Right choices. My favorite Panzer Pushing game (until Art finally releases Guderian)Outstanding Hex and Counter classic, and oh so sweet w/the beautiful new chits and easy to look at mapgreat fun game.

RATING: 8.5
With the new weather chart, the game does not play as well as the 1976 3rd ed.  Whoever came up with that stinky artificial concept for determining weather must have been drunk or was staring at a thermometer when they got the idea: 'These (the + and - symbols) would look cute in the game.
The high rating is because of the hardware.  If I use these gorgeous components, I will use the TRC II rules.
If L2 would have embodied the TRC II rules into this 4th ed. the rating would be maxed.
All in all, a heck of a job ART L.

Finally picked up this classic, and can understand it's popularity. It has that almost chess like feel of choosing set ups, selecting attacks, finding just the right hex to defend in...etc that makes for fun, competative games. The history is a bit simplistic (mountains near Kiev!) and the combat system dated

Finally played this old thing, nearly thirty years after its initial release.  Enjoyable, simple game, but the length and the tired old factor-counting aspect keep my rating low.  The many liberties taken for simplification were fine to me.   A keeper, though, one that can be enjoyed by novice and experienced gamers alike.  Easy to see why it's a classic, and the L2 production aspects are excellent.

My first real wargame.  I can understand the lack of historical realism, as well as the somewhat flawed supply rules.  On the other hand, I feel that the game is realistic enough, and I appreciate the aspect of both sides playing an offensive and defensive strategy as the game progresses.  At this point, I don't have the time, nor an interested opponent, so it probably won't see much light for a while.

John Edwards produced many classic wargames standing the test of time.  This, being one of those, has evolved into 4th edition already.

I own and have played the 3rd edition many times, although against few opponents.  Bought the 4th edition to use when playing the BPA PBEM Tournament VI.  Although beaten badly, the game system and the requirement to think through condition-setting to avoid reliance on pure luck made for an exciting and enjoyable few weeks.  Am now in the midst of 4 PBEM games simultaneously and having a great time gaining experience.  Well worth the expense and PBEM is a great way to enjoy it.

Russian Campaign is what it is - a long, light look at the Eastern Front.  It is good fun of course and it is playable, but I have several games that are better for the same duel.  On the other hand, this version of RC is beautiful.  L2 did a great job with it, so I have no complaints there at all.

I have always been a great fan of Russian Campaign since I started playing wargames seriously in 1989. This final fourth edition will always will stand the test of time for sure. With superb mapboard, nice graphics & larger size counters. You are better off playing this game as always with the expansion set kit which clearly re-defines a few things, with more counters, correction of a few rules & optional rules. I  Always play this game no matter what the constraints are. This game is an ultimate must for all World War Two game fans who like specialising on the Eastern Front. This is one game you must have in your collection if you are a Eastern Front Specialist. You can't go wrong on this 4th edition game for it's being better balanced to it's previous editions & keeping it's essence of being entertaining. The game is a perfect gift for the introductory level wargamers as well. All up this game is easy to learn, but hard to totally master it.

Another wargame to consider.  Some recommend this over Fortress Europa as the intro to wargaming.  Got it through an eBay purchase of sorts.  Can't wait to get through the rules and get a game on.

An extraordinary game with the likelihood of years of gameplay.  I can't wait to bust this out again.  The time element is definitely a challenge, but when you know it you can work with it.

Old-skool wargaming at its best!  This superb update stays true to my childhood favorite and is still fun to play.  Good historicity for such a simple game. It's great fun to blast open the Soviet lines with the Stukas (only to be later stopped cold by "General Winter").  The rules include a lot of historical "what if's?" and optional rules that keeps this classic fresh.

RATING: 2
Probably not too bad in an old-fashioned kind of way. I've marked it still lower because of the shoddy way L2 treated me: My counters were damaged on purchase so I emailed L2 twice and never got a response. Eventually I had to glue my counters together. Nice one L2 - I hope you enjoyed spending my money! Oh, and incidently, your graphics are seriously overrated.

A really great simple game with excellent L2 components. I particularly appreciate the non-icon NATO symbols available for armored units.

Looks very nice. And, since only games that are in print get played by the world at large, I should be happy with this. But I also know I'd play the third edition in a heartbeat. It may take longer for me to reach that feeling with this version. (Glad it is so similar to the original, but that also works against it. If both are the same, why buy and play this version? Yes, it is very pretty - but it takes up a LOT more space, too!) OK - I've had this long enough to get over the changes. It is still the same great game with a VERY pretty look that it rightly earned. Here's hoping it sparks everyone to get this game off the shelf and back on the game table. Now!

RATING: 8.891
This old game design really surprised me.  It has a very short rulebook, with very small font type.  I might rate it a 9 or something if you get to play the Germans as I did, but it might be a 6 or 7 if you play the Russians.  The only other downside is that it's long.  We played several hours and only got one-third of the way done, but I think one player might traditionally surrender at the halfway point anyway.

Originally from Jedko, an Aussie publisher, this title has been through several printings, this one being the best. 

The game has a double impulse system of movement/combat where each side gets to move & fight twice, which works reasonably for the system and encourages defenses in depth, as well as carefully planned penetrations for envelopment & destruction of enemy forces. The game is however a game, not good as history, or simulation. It's very good as a game though and enjoyable, though not worth jumping through hoops for.

I became interested in The Russian Campaign since it looks to have been quite influential on Eastfront, a game I very much enjoy.  I don't know if/when I'll get a chance to try it out, but from a game historian perspective, the opportunity to check it out (read: to buy it) was too good to pass up.

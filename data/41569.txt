Not a bad game, but nothing great either. The setup took an inordinate amount of time, the problem solved in the next session by pre-bagging the setup. The game played quickly, with the fire spreading relatively little and the game ending just as things seemed to be moving along nicely. This struck us as a little odd, but it certainly wasn't a bad thing. This will get more table time, and we'll see where that leads my view of this title.

Somehow upset by that one. The theme is appealing but the result is average (chaotic though not very fun). The game can be so unbalanced depending on your starting position.

Hmm...  The setup was painful.  The color choices were questionable.  The game was long and repetitive.  I'm not convinced the rules aren't broken, as the board seems lop-sided; it was too easy to control the fire.  The idea was good, though.

Andy's four point objective is Aldgate, just four of the common north move cards from the source of the fire.  Meanwhile, Belinda and Chas are both protecting St. Paul's as their four-pointer, five moves from burning and requiring some less common westerly cards.  Aldgate burns while Andy fumes.  How is this balanced?  

As others have commented, Great Fire is a highly tactical game and those tactics are pretty obvious.  It didn't really engage me on any level.   

Artwork and production quality are both pretty good, though the itty bitty crossed arrows at the corners of city blocks could have been clearer and red buildings to match red fire pieces wasn't the best choice when other colours were available.

I got this after JKLM decided they weren't going to produce Alien Ascendancy after all. I love the map, and some good ideas. We played wrong on the first play, so it deserves a second go, and probably 4p might work better than 3p. I'd happily play a game but don't feel the need to own it, so I traded away.

Not bad, but certainly not a classic. It is a bit repetitive and the strategies are limited, but playable nonetheless.

RATING: 6
This game was fun in a certain sense; it allowed for a lot of table talk about fires, burning down little houses on the board, and guessing aloud people's starting color.  So it has a certain frothiness to it.  The components are beautiful.  I liked moving the pointed red fire tokens and the extinguishing black cones.

But as far as game depth, strategy and tactics, the Great Fire seemed very lacking and only marginally interesting to think about. I just don't want to play this game again.

Light and fun game. I plays very differently from Downfall of Pompeii, another great game of similar theme.
The setup is a little annoying, but the game plays very smootlhy.
Slightly prefer to play it with 3 players rather than 4. Wouldn't recommend playing it with 5 or 6 players unless you're really into chaotic games.

Great connection between theme and mechanics as well as a beautiful board. Best played with hidden colours for a more tense game. 

The first edition has issues with some components but has a larger and in my opinion better board.

RATING: 8.8
Really clever game, spreading fires around to destroy houses and take over districts while protecting your own. There is a certain amount of hidden information since you hide your house color, and the game can feel tense and fun kind of like Downfall of Pompeii when those fires are spreading. The action points for phase 2 of your turn are neat; the tokens add a nice bonus, and the trained pieces that cap off and stabilize fires add a lot of strategy. Board is nice and there are a lot of wooden pieces! Possible downside: can take awhile to set this one up unless you're used to it and use multiple people to cut corners.

The colour cards MUST be shown first as the red card is not red - I thought was yellow other players saw it as wood. So I was trying for the wrong colour:( but worse I still came second by a point or 2. THus does the colour matter?

I got the fire movement rules but others did not. It is not clear what must be moved. We thought that id the rules said a code from a connected region must check ALL possible moves from any area in that region that is much better,

RATING: 7
Niggling irritation that the game as sold has smaller, pollarded fire cones that those pictured in the rules (issues with supply prior to Essen 2010).

First play: Quite a fiddly long winded set up. Tendency to torch opponents houses so variant to conceal colours would make a difference. A feeling that the game runs itself at times,needs another play.

Second play: near identical sentiment to first play. Played with concealed colours which was much better.

Very original game where players relive the great 1666 fire in London. Players can manipulate the spreading fire by wind cards, and using the trained bands and landowner pawn on the board. Main goal is to preserve the houses they own and to burn down houses owned by others. More points can be made by fighting the fire and preserving certain locations distributed secretly at the start of the game. Game is easy to explain and plays smoothly and quickly. Play with open landowner cards for direct attacks or play with the cards closed to enable more subtle player interaction. Solid game with the a very well implemented and original theme.

There are some issues with the components. Cards are a bit flimsy but the main problem is that colors are not consistent over the components. Houses for the orange player are red while they are tan for the white player. Color card for red/orange looks way too yellow. So I've had people trying to save the wrong houses during the game because they thought they were another color.

It might not be desperately fair to rate a game after just one play, in which we did not get the rules quite right (the fire would have moved a bit faster if we had). However, as a 5 player it just felt a bit too chaotic for my taste.

The game works as a longer, slightly more complex version of Clans. Obviously, pouring the fire onto other people's houses is fun but not enough to obviate the longer play time for me.

This game feels like a more strategic version of the game called Clans. Players take turns fighting/influencing the fire. You have a secret color and secret locations that you are trying to protect. The more cubes of that color that survive the fire, the more points you earn. Opponents are trying to figure out your color to burn those cubes/locations. It's okay and there is some tension, but I'm not a fan of "secret color" deception/bluffing games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Each player has 3 secret regions of the board to protect and also a secret colour of houses to protect. This is coupled to a method of controlling fire outbreaks and direction via card play and which "fire cones" you move where. A fun and clever game, with one really big complaint. My secret card was an orangey colour house, so I protected the beigey coloured houses and was winning by miles there, plus I had the "longest hose"
bonus for putting out most fires - excellent! Turns out the white colour on the card protects the beige housese and the orange coloured card protects the reds houses, the ones I had burned with wild abandon all game. My entire game was ruined - I finished second not first! 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Provisional rating, might change if I play it again. Very tactical game, and the tactics are fairly obvious. You can get stuffed before the game if your secret vp objectives aren't stuffed with other's houses or shared ...

Overall I didn't feel the game matched the mechanics, I was directing the card by playing wind cards, so what role am I in the game? I'd prefer a random fire spread mechanic like in Pandemic.

Juego que viene a simular el gran incendio de londres. Cada jugador representa un terrateniente que tiene propiedades repartidas por la ciudad. Debe procurar salvar sus propiedades y que se quemen las de los demás. No había bomberos,sino milicias que eran contratadas por los caballeros para combatir el fuego. En cada turno, el fuego se propaga según la dirección de una de las cartas jugadas por el jugador (siempre tiene cinco en la mano para escoger las direcciones de propagación). Después el jugador dispone de cuatro acciones para mover milicias que controlen fuegos y el caballero. Cuando el caballero llega a una zona donde todos los fuegos estan controlados por milicidas, puede gastar acciones para apagar fuegos. 
Al final del juego, el jugador que más puntuación sume gana. La puntuación depende de las propiedades que aún te queden sin quemar, los fuegos que hayas conseguido apagar y unos puntos extra de unas cartas que se distribuyen al principio y que representan zonas de la ciudad que debes evitar que se quemen.
Está entretenido. Es sencillo de explicar y de jugar y no dura mucho. Recomendable.

Easy rules and game play with room for tactics.  You also have secret goals that you especially don't want to burn, and these may be shared by other players, though you can't be sure.

I have wanted a fire game for quite some time and this is a decent shot at one.  Interesting decisions to keep fire away from you but to risk your own districts to get something of value is necessary.

Played with the random colors.  Only complaint from the group was that the random bonus districts seemed unbalanced.  Some only scored 2 points while others scored 12.  Those with 12 managed to get all the eastern districts.

2011-2-10:A simple enough game that I could probably be talked into anytime. Last night's loss was a bit demoralising - I had a 5pt lead in open VP but lost all my cities, whilst others gained 6pts. My strategy - of prioritising open info - was definitely wrong.

That the open information plays such a small role in the final scoring can make for exciting end-game scoring and I'd like to learn how to 'control' the fire, ensuring others' areas are burnt. 

I am literally ambivalent towards this.

3-6 players w/ 2 player option in forums
Players are men of wealth and standing who own property around London. Lead trained bands of militia to fight the fire and save the city. To do so they must decide which districts to sacrifice to the fire and which to protect. Remember, these same men own much of London, thus such choices will shape their own future and greatly affect their wealth and standing. Use the trained bands to suppress the fire and explosives to destroy blocks of housing to create fire breaks and prevent its spread. Do you choose to protect your own homes, turning a blind eye and allowing the fire to consume your rival's property? Or will you stand as the hero of London, and choose to save as much of the city as possible

I have new played this several times and although I really like it there always seems to be somthing missing. The fire spread never really seems as urgent as somthing like pandemic and the complicated set up leaves you wondering if it was realy worth it.

The game itself looks great when its all laid out and the historically accurate board is a winner.

I think a few more plays may see my rating change for the better.

I probably need to play this with 3 or so players because I certainly dont enjoy it with 6.
Planning and strategy from turn to turn is completely pointless (apart from not blowing the fire straight towards your seceret goals) since the positions will change so rapidly.
Even in "in turn" tactical play is unsatisfying since, with hidden colours and goals, you can only aim for mild improvements in your turn.
In the end, we burnt the houses to an equal level, ravaged most goal areas and the winner was whoever was lucky enough to have more than 1 goal left unburnt and got lucky with an extra VP token instead of other token types.
It was kind of fun, but also fiddly and random. Or at least, fiddly for something that's mostly random fun.

And then there's the colour mismatch SNAFU...

[July 2017 - 6.5]
It's one of the best looking games I own (great components and board), but it's just a bit too chaotic for my tastes. 

The real game here is gaining points off putting out fires because the points from houses not being burned down tend to be fairly even by the end of the game. That being the case, you're goal is more to get the fire to come to your leaders.

As others have mentioned, it's a bear to set up. I find making preset bags with five of each color (at the end of each game) saves a little time for the next game on the front end.

3 fővel próbáltuk elsőre, így nem volt hosszú a játék menet.
Kinézet: alapvetően szép, kicsit hamburgumos színek.
Elemek: k* sok "bábu", ami nem lenne baj, ha nem az elején kéne feltenni ebből 100-t, így viszont viszonylag hosszú setup. /Igaz ez rövidíthető, ha a játék elpakolásakor okosan csoportosítjuk, zacskózzuk az elemeket, illetve ha többen setupolnak -van rá lehetőség./
A játék.
Hm. 
Tűzterelegetés, lehetőleg az ellenfelek házai irányába. :-)
Egy picit csalódást éreztem, én előzetesen sokkal stratégiaibb játéknak hittem, de miután ezen túltettem magam - s azon , h kedves játékostársaim leégették az elején pár házam, és a tüzeimet amiket oltottam volna elvették-, szóval átgondolva a játékot:
viszonylag gyors játék, és szerintem inkább a mókázás irányba érdemes gondolni rá, bár nyilván kell s lehet tervezni, de ha inkább gonoszkodós, mókázós, leégetlek hehe, alapon játsszuk, akkor egy nagyon kellemes, vidám, családi játék lesz, ami mindenkinek sok örömet, és bosszankodást is okoz. Gyanítom 4-5 játékosnál még inkább érvényesül az égessünk meg mindenki mást elv.
Szóval nem kell agyzsugorítani, persze nem árt azért gondolkodni, de inkább vidámra kell venni a figurát, és élvezni a lángokat, tűzoltást.

May 2014 ... Have played this several times now.  I like this a lot more than I thought I would to be honest.  It has fast, easy play where you actually feel like you're doing something, even though everything is pretty chaotic, especially with more players.

It has a long, tedious setup that is fairly offputting.  If you can get past that it's a fun game.

This was played at Baycon2011.

I would like to play this again.

Christmas Gift 2012.

This was better the second time round and with a smaller group of players as you had more control over where the fire was spreading.

Gameplay is very repetitive though, often you will burn your own houses down because the two points you lose are nothing compared to the power of the dynamite or victory point tokens.

The secret victory point cards are a nice touch however I was disappointed that there were multiples in the deck.

The component quality is quite shocking the white houses are actually a strange beige colours and the orange houses are red, the same colour as the fire cones and therefore difficult to see in the midst of the board, however as long as this is pointed out to all players at the start of the game so everyone is aware this is only a minor issue.

I really wanted to like this game but it is average and undeveloped in some details imo. The number of actions and rules of spreading of fire makes most of the moves quite automatic. There are few choices and they may be ruined anyway by others. 

There are also some balance issues. Some of them obvious like the situation that two players can defend the same 6 point district which can be game winning and depends on the draw:(

A very light and chaotic game with a tiresome setup procedure.

Everyone owns a number of houses around London that score points when not consumed by the fire and also has a couple of secret goals for saving certain quarters. The houses themselves are somewhat of a red herring. Players will strive to not let any one player run away with the game and thus keep the playing field level throughout so trying to save your houses is pretty much futile. In fact, any semblance of controlled play is pretty much destroyed as soon as you realize that fire can travel arbitrary distances before spreading into new areas. There simply is no way to somewhat reliably protect certain areas so winning becomes very much a question of how the goal cards have been distributed. If several players have an interest in keeping the fire away you might be lucky enough to preserve your goal, otherwise you're screwed.

After realizing strategic play isn't possible at all, the game becomes entirely opportunistic with players simply scoring as many points or destroying as many houses of opponents as possible during their turns.

Preordered directly and the game never came.

The game was claimed to have been sent a number of times but I never had a whiff of it.  This has never happened to me before and to have a game "sent" on a number of occasions and never arrived, to me, seems somewhat odd.  Also, communication from the company is extremely poor.  Have given up getting anything back and am very disappointed.  I now know which company I will never buy from again.

Played the prototype with Chooi... fun and interesting theme, nicely realised.. Good amount of player interaction. We played with the 'balanced' intensifications (each player intensifying once, based on staged card draws) and a recent rule change such that players did not know what colour houses others had... which I liked a lot.
It was nice seeing the burnt-down houses line up during the game, but I felt the way we did end game scoring was a little messy... removing houses from the track for other points scored (fires extinguished and VP resource tokens claimed) and then deducting from 40 points.

Bought on the theme and visual appeal, after reading the rules I was a little put off, fearing too much chaos and randomness. But it works well. The games trots along at a goodly pace, there is sufficient tension in protecting objectives and trying to manouevre fire into advantageous positions. A lot more fun that I thought it would be, and kept my interest through the whole play. Setup is fiddly, and the rules overly difficult to explain, but simple in play. Pleased with my purchase, definitely a good entry for middle edging to light fairly long games. There were production issues (houses the wrong colour) but this has not been a problem for anyone so far. The cards are very good, the board is visually lovely.

Plays in around an hour to an hour fifteen.

Played once with three players, one colourblind hidden colours. Both the colourblind player and my other opponent thought they were orange. It explained why I was having such a tough game.

I think this was a tough choice of theme for a first  attempt at game design. What sort of a game can you design around a catastrophe? Well, it's been turned into a hidden identity game, so inevitably you direct the fire to evenly destroy the coloured houses then point monger by putting out as many fires as possible. There's a production cock-up that only JKLM, sorry Prime Games could have produced: the cards showing your hidden identity are in orange and white, the corresponding wooden pieces are red and natural. In our first game, both players thought they were trying to save the natural wood houses with hilarious consequences. Overall, this is thematically strong, but with too little control.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The way the fire spreads is interesting and kinda fun to watch. Fairly similar to the Downfall of Pompeii and just as chaotic, however it's longer and fiddlier. You can be totally screwed by the setup and what everyone else semi-randomly decides to do without even knowing who they're hitting while you have very little control. Not a good thing at all in a game of this length.

RATING: 6
I'll be honest: I was mostly interested in playing this because I'd been considering designing a game about fire spreading through a city (I'd been thinking of San Francisco, but London is just as good), and players being able to blow up buildings to prevent the fire from spreading in certain directions. This is much better than the game that I would have designed, so it frees me from that responsibility and I'm very happy about that (this also inspires some respect for the designers).

It combines secret identities with secret goals.  I don't usually like secret identities, but in this game they were somehow less obnoxious than usual because they didn't constrain players' options as much as they sometimes do. I was surprised at the end of the game to find that the secret goals are not unique.  I'm not sure this is a good thing; if multiple players are protecting the same area that would seem to give them a random advantage.  There were also some issues with the colors chosen, which were sometimes difficult to distinguish.  (1 play)

Unfortunately a second playthrough has confirmed what I feared after the first game - this game is complete randomness from start to finish.  One player spent the entire game defending [i]the wrong color[/i] and still had a competitive finish.  What makes it so disappointing is that the fire-spreading is one of the more interesting and compelling game mechanics I've seen in quite awhile (and the game is quite beautiful) - the designer just forgot to design an interesting game around it.

This game seems okay, like Downfall of Pompeii but more serious and less funny.  You are trying to burn down everyone else's houses while trying to keep yours standing while also pretending to be a brave fireman (in a way).  Gateway weight that may be more fun than a solo play suggests.  It's worth keeping, just may not get pulled out much.  Have to see how others like this.

Interesting game, nice board and components. However the playing options and strategies are very limited. I played a 5-player game and won. My strategy was to put out the maximum of fires. This gave me the most points, including the bonus of 2 points.
Another strategy might be to bomb away houses around your target in order to stop propagation of fire. But this requires a lot of bomb tokens which would be difficult to do.

Another point: when playing a 4 or 5 player game it is difficult to control anything because the situation can change completely between 2 turns.

Huge colourproblem as the red houses are represented by the orange cards.

White is wood (natural) and no fire cones.

the colour of the red houses is way wrong. Hope they fix that.

The game is surprisingly fun for a game that takes almost 2 hours  and is pretty light.

Scores are close
Gust : 26 (houses 20 white)+2+4 fire cones

Please keep in mind I've only played once...and I played with two other people who were determined to keep the fire in check.  I really wanted to like this game - oh well.

LIKES:

DISLIKES:

* Color scheme of the cards/board does not match the color of the playing pieces.  C'mon, this isn't rocket science.

* Board is missing about 4-5 arrows indicating allowed fire movement.  Really?

* I wanted the fire to burn.  Too many other people in the game forgot that this was the GREAT fire of London and kept the dang thing contained making for a boring game.  It worked for them - they finished 1-2 separated by one point.  Wasn't much fun for me though.

* Card draw can really restrict the fire movement.

RATING: 6
This depiction of the capital’s tragic conflagration is marred by one, possibly two flaws. The undeniable weakness is the presentation; non-corresponding colours on cards and game pieces is an unforgivable blunder in a game of secret victory conditions, and the rulebook does its level best to make simple, elegant mechanics appear to be convoluted and complex.

A possible problem is that the real heart of the game might not be the strategic aspect of spreading fire, but rather the bluffing and intrigue revolving around the buildings you’d secretly like to see survive throughout the game. If this turned out to be the case, you’d just have a more involved and considerably longer version of Drunter & Drüber.

Nevertheless, our first game went well, with a very narrow victory gained by a fellow London merchant whose exemplary citizen spirit was aptly demonstrated by detonating the Guildhall, facing the threat of nary more than a few glowing, well-contained embers in the neighbouring blocks ...

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The basic idea that you don't know who holds what color is what makes this game.  You bluff about your own color, but you really can't hurt any individual player intentionally.  This causes a catch up mechanic for the player in last as players tend to democratize the destruction of buildings.

The Great Fire of London 1666 simulates the fire which swept through London, England, in that year.  The game is sort-of semi-cooperative in that players are working together to contain the fire.  The board is a map of London, and at the start of the game fire tokens will be placed in one area.  Over the course of the game the fire will spread, burning down buildings as it travels.  The not-so cooperative part is that you are also attempting to steer the fire away from areas you are trying to protect for points, and towards areas that will harm the other players.  Whomever has the most of their buildings and special areas standing will win.

It's fascinating to watch the fire (actually orange plastic cones) spread through the city, and imagine what the real fire must have been like.  Playing gave me a similar feel to Pandemic, as players attempt to put out the flames, instead of the viral outbreaks, before it's too late.  The board and components are nice, and a pleasure to work with.  I was immediately hooked into this game after just one turn.  It's possibly my favourite game that I don't own.

I've been waiting to play this for a long time. Finally got  my chance at UK Games Expo 2010. I've only had one play, but I am extremely encouraged by the late-version prototype. This is an excellent game with a really novel fire-spreading mechanism that is both simple and beautiful in its execution. There is a lot of tactical play in the use of firemen; and the way each player gets their turn to 'fan the flames' is sweet. Also, the board looks great in the latest incarnation - even better when everything's burning.

My only negatives are that, dependent on which side of the board you sit, you may have to think of 'West' as "East" and "North" as "South" and vice versa, but this is really a minor quibble. Slightly more troubling is that the stackable cones used to represent both fire and firemen in the prototypes are to be dropped for pretty wooden flame tokens in the production version. These were on display at one of the play test booths and, though undoubtedly attractive and contributing to the theme, they seemed less successful as components.

Both my negatives are extremely minor. This is a game that flows smoothly and has clear, simple instructions that are pretty easy to teach (though I didn't initially grasp the fire spread priority or the fact that demolition was done only by firemen, not by the player pawn).

For my money, an essential purchase.

Novel theme, therefore different, but not enough control over the burning of your own and opponents' houses. Seems very random and luck driven. Everyone tends to lose about the same number of houses.

You would think that a game about something as terrifying and dramatic as the Great Fire of London would elicit some kind of emotion during gameplay, wouldn't you?  I'm not exactly talking about tears or high-fives around the table, but at least some level of interest.  Instead, it was an exercise in, "Oh, this cone moves two spaces here" and "I'll move this fireman to this space here".  

And the setup will take you a half hour at least.

This is a very nice game indeed. The presentation is quite excellent. Wonderful period map, very colorful components, cards are lovely. However there is some minor board warping which spoils an otherwise quality production and loses a couple of points from me :-( Also the orange player card should be red.

Beware if you are color blind as there is a dizzying array of colors.

A very refreshing design and theme compared to the usual Euro brain burner stuff which keeps getting gets rehashed. The theme works very well as you work together to a certain degree to fight the fire or at least manage it (not likely). nice features with the blind discs giving vips, explosives or opportunities o spread the fire even more.

Well thought out design.

6- players makes it a bit too long though. 4 should be optimum.

Some interesting elements, but the hidden goals have the potential for endgame swings depending on arbitrary actions by the last player(s).  That would be more forgivable if the game were shorter.  Some production problems also.

RATING: 3
Horrible. I really couldn't stand this game, which started out with an excruciatingly long setup and consisted of some of the most chaotic play I've ever experienced. I'm sure some of this had to do with the fact that we were playing with six, but, after hearing the rules, it was pretty clear there was going to be no control at any player count. It seems like the gains from protecting your color house are marginal at best, as everyone's going try to keep the playing field level there. You can't really protect your area except by finding the dynamite, but that requires lucking into grabbing the dynamite, which is hidden around the board. Then there's the points you can get from stopping fires, which anybody can do, but really that seemed to come down to people getting hooked up by the people on their left with sweet board position. Although I liked the board, the rainbow of houses and the red cones looked gaudy, adding to the feeling that I was playing a half-baked (haha!) design. I could perhaps be persuaded that at a lower player count this might have some merit, but at six I have to go with "never again."

Uno de los juegos que me parece que caerá en mis manos en unos meses,  por lo que he visto por internet parece bastante interesante, ha sido presentado en la feria de Essen y quiero mirar las críticas pero tiene buena pinta.
Ya me ha llegado, una única partida y la verdad es que ha estado muy bien, aunque hemos jugado a dos y según las reglas lo mínimo es a tres.
Ganas de probarlo con más gente.

Sounds like a gateway game.

You have a fire starting in the lower middle portion of the map. Houses are spread out randomly, with some measures to help it from being too random. The fire spreads and you get points for putting out the fire, keeping your houses safe, and meeting secret objectives to keep certain parts of the city safe.

Sounds fairly interesting.

The game design shows that a lot of thought (and presumably time) has gone into the making of this game, but for me it just doesn't produce the results.
The mechanic of getting a double card play from some of the disks means that the players do not have an even number of turns and it screws with every player having the opportunity to "intensify" the fires.
Despite having 5 cards in your hands the choice of fire movement is limited.
If the game was a quick filler, then fair enough but for a game runing to over an hour.... No. Set up too long and very little possibility of strategic decisions.

RATING: 4.8
Well, now that we've got the ruleset down correctly, I've got to say... this is one random-ass game.  There's so much take-that happening it blinds the senses.  And yeah, a lot of the game will be based on pure luck -- the houses on the west coasts seem to be pretty safe.  It's fun in the same vein as Eat Poop You Cat or an Exquisite Corpse.  It's an activity.  There's too much random for there to be an element of personal control over your destiny.

But hey, it's fun.  And so it's saved from damnation.

Also, I don't get how this game designer could spend all this time and effort getting the art design to look THIS GOOD... and then producing it on the crappiest board I've seen in a while.  It looks like a senior year art project, not a professional product.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
There's a good game here, especially if you like an "out of control" type mechanic represented by the fire.   If you like games of certainty, this is NOT one for you.

I've knocked off a full 0.5 for the production quality... some corners were definitely cut.

I think the game could go up or down another full point as I find out if the game has the replayability factor or if the game feels the same each time. 

EDIT:  Another playing, this time with all 6 players.  The game was even more out of control and not in a good way.  I detected some real problems with the fire spreading mechanic as well, since with more players the fire will spread a lot more before your turn returns.  This renders firebreaks almost completely useless as it does planning ahead.  The game becomes more about luck than anything else.  Still, it is an interesting game to watch unfold, although there's not a lot of strategy to be had.

I'll bet it's more fun with 3 or 4 players, but this recent playing has led me to the decision that I will not be acquiring this game.  Feurio is better.

Final note: There were not enough fire tokens in our 6 player game to account for all the fires burning.  More fire tokens should have been included.

L'ambientazione è riuscita e l'effetto di incendio che si espande è efficace. Il gioco però mi è parso poco governabile. Quattro diversi obiettivi segreti, punti segreti, tutto poco intuitivo che porta a far mosse a caso cercando di non avvantaggiare nessun avversario. Un gioco che mi ha da la sensazione assegni la vittoria a caso.

Played it in Essen with two not that enthusiastic Germans. 
I was into it ; they not !
Nice idea of getting rid of the other player and still trying to save your own property. Rules were explained a bit to quick, but we managed.
Good idea, would like to play it again, but won't buy it because of the price-quality relationship : over 40€ for a game on which the pieces couldn't keep up straight always because the board was bending up.

A mix of Metro and Heimlich, two of my (least) favorite games.  There is a little bit of strategy, and I still had fun playing it for the first time to see how it unraveled.  It is too chaotic for my taste, and the payoff of victory is not there, just feels lucky.  Will likely do my best to avoid playing again.

RATING: 7
A grown up Drunter & Druber, where you have a secret colour you're trying to protect (eg there's 20 blue houses out there you don't want to burn) and 3 secret areas you don't want to burn. The more that stay alive, the more points you score. Each turn you god-like say which direction the fire's burning and spread it into a new district in that direction, hopefully burning opponents' buildings. Then you get 4 action points to try and get your meeple in the same district as one of the 6 general firefighters and a fire token. All 3 combined earns you the fire token which is a VP, and whoever gets the most of these get a Settler's style 2 points. The fire will generally only spread into districts with unburnt buildings in them, so putting out the fire in a district getting close to one of your secret districts may be enough to force other players to expand it somewhere else on the board. And that pretty much summarises the game. Turns go fast as your best options are usually straight forward - burn as many things that aren't yours as possible, get as many fire tokens as you can. With so much happening on other people's turns that's out of your control, don't put too much emotional investment in the result though. Still, like Drunter & Druber, it provides some highly tactical entertainment (once the overly long fiddly pre-game setup is completed anyway).

One of the more unique games I have played. This is a competitive firefighting game where each player has certain hidden objectives as to what he is trying to protect.  It has a psuedo-cooperative game feel, but the underlying competition is interesting.  On each players turn, he must advance the fire according to certain rules, and then he fights the fires.  I suspect the replay ability should be good for several games.

I had a blast playing this with 3 other friends. 
This game is random enough to be full of tension and suspense but guided enough that you feel like you are changing the course of the game with your decisions. The fact that each players' color and objectives are hidden from the others make it interesting as well. There are always 6 colors on the map, so when you start a fire in a new distract, you may not even be affecting other players (if there are less than 6).
Once you understand the fire priority well, the game goes quickly. We were pretty confused at the point of the landowner at first, but we found out (after reading the instructions 4 times!) that the landowner is used to tell the militias to put out the fire! So the fire can be contained but not out if no one moves their landowner to the contained fire and orders it put out. This is one of the ways you can get victory points. The others are how many houses and objectives that haven't been destroyed at the end of the game.
Another interesting consequence of the game is that you find out which of your friends are the firebugs (or who just like to watch the world burn, pun intended :D). One of the people I played with seemed to be the most likely to be the best team player; that is until he went out of his way to start fires in every objective with 3 or more houses! I think I'll keep that guy away from any fireworks in the near future... ;)
Anyway, I am very excited to play this game again!

Haven't played it but I have seen it played by 6 players. It seemed rather fun in a chaotic way but I won't buy this game. I see little interest in 3-5 players (a bit dry with 3-4 players I fear and so many other games to play).

Besides, the game is costly, is not very 'non-gamer friendly' despite the apparent simplicity (because of the priority rules). And if I want chaos, I'll play roborally or some small game like 6 nimmt.

This is a tactical game where you control firefighters on a map of London, moving them around to put out fires.  You score points for eliminating fire tokens and saving various districts from burning (known only to you).  You have some control over where the fire goes, so generally you try to burn down districts that aren't yours.  It's a decent tactical game, but it doesn't offer much in the way of long-term strategy.

Really enjoyed this game the first couple of times I played it, but it becomes a bit same-y after several games.

It's a bit odd how players play as both land owners and manage the growth of the fire, but it works ok.

Kinda neat, but I'm not sure how much long term replayability it has...

The fire mechanic is great. I find it very innovative. Yet, something seems to be missing. The fire tends to spread towards the left, so the right part seems more protected. I also think it's too long for a light game. Nevertheless it's really nice to see London burn and I think some more planned players would really enjoy this. Would like to try this with player's colours kept secret.

Like Clans, but much less strategic and way too long.

I think what weakens this game is the contradictory goals to burn London down and put out fires. Burning down London is fun. Putting out fires, which might be fun if you're saving your own districts, frustrates and sometimes ruins plans to burn the city down.

For a light game, this sure takes some setting up before the first fire spreads. It does look good, and the theme is a winner, but in my two games I've just been bored. Opponents are hidden, as are their locations, so it's about damage limitation, but there's not enough control. If played super quickly, I'll play.

High 6 rather than low 6. There is a large map showing districts of London on to which go (randomly) the houses of the players, a small band of fire fighters, and the players landlords.
Players move the fire then take four actions (the game is structured and feels very like Pandemic other than its competitive nature). You move the fire fighters around trying to protect your property, and your landlord trying to claim the credit for putting the fire out. 
The game is light and easy to play and ought to be a good gateway or family game but I suspect it isn't. The problem is the way the fire prioritises moves while simple to understand requires considerable thought to accurately establish (we repeatedly played it incorrectly). If a group is competitive but not highly experienced I can imagine the constant 'oh, I just spotted you cheated on your last move' would wear out the players.
There are also quite a few minor niggles, with the symbols used at diagonal junctions being completely different to those used for the cardinal points of the compass, with some cases where common sense says a fire can move but the board doesn't permit it, and with some of the colour choices (white & yellow, both for two players, but also for two different sorts of board space). And there are a lot of pieces to set up, and some of the set-up fiddliness seems un-needed.
Overall, should be better than it is.

Darn it, didn't win this in the recent competition, but managed to obtain a copy through geektrade.  Well, had my first game today which was a 3 player.
First impression, damn that's a lot of setup time.  Didn't read the rules enough to have my wife blowing up the key building to 'protect them', which zapped her score.
Also need to clarify what happens with the fire warden cones, can they move once they are supressing a fire?

The gameplay fits the theme nicely in this easily learnt and yet rewarding effort. The mechanic is intriguing as players draw the fire in the direction of the firefighters while at the same time using the firefighters to shield their victory point areas and building colour. It's all quite simple and can be played for the fun of it rather than taking it too seriously. The game achieves what it sets out to do - a fun, light, richly themed gaming experience in about 45 minutes.

Revised rating from 8 (2011) to 6 (2013).

Was initially enamoured with this game. The theme was fresh, the map was gorgeous and it was fun to play. Repeated plays have changed my opinion of the game considerably. It seems quite random or uncontrollable (I suppose fire is!) and the cards dealt at the start can really swing things.

ALSO: you will need to replace some components because their colours are incorrect (or you could just get used to them).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I like the theme, although the mechanics distract from it. I also like the bluffing and guesswork of the hidden objectives. But setup is too fiddly for a family game. Also, as the fire approaches buildings you're meant to protect, it's hard not to feel powerless to stop it. As a result, the initial card draw is more important than it should be.

Players collaboratively protect London from burning down (or, rather, collaboratively attempt to direct the great fire of London to burn down opponents' properties). In play, it's sort of like an advanced Clans: players score for protecting map locations and a specific colour of building, precisely which are kept secret. I think it's probably better with 4 players because there are more colours which no-one owns.

My impression after a few plays is that the goal cards can be problematic. It's likely that multiple players will have incentives to stop the fire moving in a particular direction, but an unbalanced distribution of goal cards skews this against anyone unlucky enough to be interested in more distant property.

Good game, lovely production (in second edition).

Very thematic and fun semi-cooperative game with lots of opportunities to hurt your opponents. A relatively simple, yet clever, layered design.

Very annoying that "Orange" turned out to be "Red" (the exact same color as the fire pieces), and that there is a handful of map errata (missing connections). Rating lowered a bit for these 1st edition goofs.

Excellent (evocatiave) box art.

Replayability is excellent - I do like this game quite a bit, and it should be seeing a lot more table time in the future. [update] Indeed, it has become one of the most requested titles of one our gaming groups.

Not bad. The way NSEW movement is mapped to real London districts is a bit convoluted, and the fire-movement rules take a bit of grocking.

There are a few little things that stop me from getting too excited: huge amount of visual information on the board & pieces, chances that you're defending a district alone while opponents are cooperating in defence. Chance of your houses on your district so you get a double hit when burnt. Somehow we always seemed to miss the fact that a "fire spreads" card was sitting on the draw deck, so a turn had to be undone while we dealt with this.

Hilariously, the winner in our game was assigned the colour "red" secretly, and misinterpreted his card to spend the entire game playing as "natural" before discovering he'd won when we flipped cards.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a fantastic game where players (land owners) are trying to save their buildings by dispatching fire fighters to keep the fire from spreading into their area. At the same time each player spreads the fire into opposing areas by playing cards from their hand. The player with the least amount of destroyed buildings at the end of the game wins. It should be noted that I play with a variant set of cards that may be released as an expansion at a later date.

Great looking game with well done components, but...

It takes forever to setup and then you seem to spend more time trying not to set the other players up. It doesn't feel like there are lots of chances for really clever plays. The game is ok, but just ok

This game reminded me a lot of [thing=13004][/thing].  There is a great fire raging across London and each player is trying to prevent certain locations (secretly assigned) from burning.  The first part of each players turn is to spread the fire (dictated by a hand of cards), then you get 4 actions to move the firefighters and your pawns so that you can put out fires or keep them from spreading.

I played it 3 player and I don't think that's the optimal number.  There are 6 different colors of houses and each player is assigned one color to protect from burning.  So at 3 players, half of the houses don't matter at all.  Also, I think we were able to keep the fire more contained, so it didn't get quite as crazy.

Ultimately an OK game, but I would rather play [thing=13004][/thing], if for no other reason than that you get to throw people in a volcano.

Hmm been on my Wishlist as a '1' for donkey's years. Glad I played someone else's though because I'm not convinced. IT's got some great mechanics, is original and has a good theme. But how easy is it to stop your stuff nurning? The winner in our game just happened to have his three bonus areas right out in teh West and the fire primarily went South...or did he manage to channel it that way. I need another game of this to see how much is luck. It certainly plays very nicely, although the set-up is a mare!

The game looks nice, and the theme is nicely implemented. It does actually feel like a fire is spreading - and like in reality, there's not much you can do to influence where it's going. I didn't understand why you had to draw cards and play them - I always had all kinds of directions in my hand so the cards never were a limiting factor to the actions I had. Rather, it was impossible to protect your houses and secret goals. In a 5 player game, my secret goal was totally safe when it was may turn but when it was my next turn, it was already destroyed.
All in all, it felt like a great simulation of a fire but there was little you could do to influence anything.

Played once with 4 players. Nice components, but not very functional. People were confused by the colors. I guess it is pretty thematic as it is very difficult to control the direction of the fire and if you know somebody has a high value district in an area far from the fire, it seems to be difficult to move the fire in that direction, especially if the direction is the east as there are not many east cards. Interesting concept though.

RATING: 5
The theme of the Great Fire of London 1666 is overwhelmingly successful and the game play is... relaxing.  The entire table is attempting to influence each plume of flames and there will probably be 2-3 plumes to pick from.  So, there isn't much control and the best decision each turn seems pretty clear.

This game is not as hardcore in strategy as other games, but we find ourselves laughing all the time as we burn down and blow up each other's homes.  A unique, fun game that plays up to 6 players in a reasonably short time.

I like the way this game simulates with card play the spreading fire and the effort to contain it, but there is not much thought required as to what play to make, and the long setup time and fiddly components are big detractors for me.

This is a very nice game. It has excellent components and it is easy, fast, and fun to play. The game is more fun and less strategy. It is very appealing to new players. You will have a great time with it.

A mechanically interesting abstract that has some hidden scoring mechanisms to keep things interesting.

I think the strategy is a little unpredictable, but that definitely matches the theme.  A good game, if somewhat unspectacular.

September 1666. A careless baker in Pudding Lane forgot to put out his fire and it spread creating an inferno which would destroy 13,000 houses and make 70,000 of London’s 80,000 population homeless. The Lord Mayor fails to act and it is down to the trained bands of militia led by a few worthies to fight the fire and finally put it out. To do so they must decide which districts to demolish to protect others. These same individuals own much of London and making such choices is painful. In the end though it is an opportunity for many. Someone is going to come out of this with the most property intact and someone will be seen to do the most to fight the fire. Could that someone have enough influence and popularity to become the next Mayor?

The players are men of wealth and standing who own property around London. They can use the trained bands to fight the fire, use demolitions to destroy blocks of housing to prevent the fire flowing or turn a blind eye and allow the fire to spread and damage rival’s property. Victory can belong to the player with the most property left but putting out fires can give you a boost. In addition each player will have several hidden objectives which might include helping another player or protecting parts of the city.

The setup is tedious. The fire is too fiddly to be enjoyable. I plan to play my copy of Flash Point: Fire Rescue and trade this game away.

RATING: 6
Very atmospheric, but pretty random and with a big take that element. Opportunities are dictated by the action cards you draw and your chances of survival partly depend on the random setup of the houses on the board and the random distribution of secret goals. The player who is left alone the most is probably going to win, although the game does allow for some tactical play every now and then. All in all an entertaining package, but not satisfying enough to want to own.

Want to play at Essen 2010

August 2011: The board was already set up when I joined, fortunately. The game depends very much on the cards you get, and especially when you get them. Somehow I get the feeling that there's a very good game hidden in this concept, but TGFoL1666 fails to deliver. Too bad.

Only one play so far, I was really intrigued by the interplay of the mechanisms, but much like a fire, it felt very uncontrollable in the end.  There's a lot to like about the game, but I'm not so sure that the sum of it's parts really come together to make magic.

Not a bad game but it has not enough ingredients to make it interesting to play. It promises interaction and devastation but actually it's a race for ceasing fire cones because the objectives will surely burn. The game lacks of incentives to have a good gaming experience.

RATING: 3.5
You own 6 point district can be burned down before your first turn; another one survives because two people get to score it, and a 3rd one has 3 houses there. The game is lost before it starts; fortunately(?), you only get to know that after the end.

Nice thematic game, but the distribution of the scoring cards is likely to decide the game, not your actions.

Rating stays after 3rd game. Unique scoring cards help, but not enough to keep the game interesting. Now the winner is the one who puts out most fires - with the effect that there were'nt many fires at all.

Use cards to determine the direction of the wind (and thus fire spread) and then move your pieces to try to put out the fires and save London from burning (or at least the bits of London that your character owns...).  There's a lot of set-up for this game before you can start playing, but it is wonderfully thematic (aside from London landlords controlling the weather...) and quite fun mechanically once you do so.

Little known fact: British fireman are called 'temperature tamers' and a raging UK fire is called a TEMPERATURE INFERNO.

None of which matters a bit, since [i]Great Fire of London[/i] is fairly dull. I waited years to play, and was disappointed when I finally did. The VPs are particularly swingy due to the random (i.e., unfair) secret goals.

Minor production problems with the colors of the houses and cards. You are trying to force the fire in one direction or the other to protect your property and buildings. The fire spreads no matter what you do so there is a lot of sacrifices that have to take place. Your color is hidden, so no one knows who is who. Enjoyable game.

I really like this game. The map is beautiful and components generally high quality (with the exception of the narrow flame cones that tend to fall over a bit - the original wider cones on which the black Trained Band cones could stack sound like a much better idea). 

This seems to have a great deal more 'chrome' than many historical games, in the sense that you do get the feel of trying to contain a conflagration that is threatening to burst out all over, and keep it away from areas of value to you. For a historian (and grognard) like me this gives the crucial narrative hook to the game that I often find a bit lacking in more abstract games. 

The random allocation of objectives means that no two games ever play out the same - one game you may have everything to the north of Pudding Lane being devastated, the next game that area may hardly be touched.

Only downside I can think of is the slightly fiddly setup, but even that shouldn't take more than 10 minutes or so, and the pleasure of playing the game is well worth it.

I'm always up for a game of this.

Very nice game, but you really do have to be competitive. Sacrificing a few of your own houses to burn down what might be other players' Victory Point locations has to be considered... The rules on spreading the fire seem quite complex at first, but are logical and do add an layer of difficulty to the decisions...

I have the original edition, looks fine to me.

Decent game. Seemed to have a little too much going on at first but made sense about halfway through. We also botched a major rule in our first game to add fire equal to houses burned down, so the fire was very tame.

Second game started a little slow but ended well. 

It's borderline boring for the first half of the game but picks up after that and can get pretty good. It's slightly long for what it is too. If you can play quickly I can see the game being good but it's not great for me.

This game just wasn't for me. I love the theme, the map, and the box cover, but IMO the game's setup is much too fiddly and long for such low pay-off. I can see many people enjoying the game, but I did not.

Played with five players. Horrible! Nobody wants to finish that game. High downtime between turns (You can start with your plannings not until your pre-player has finished  his turn). Game-Feeling like the game-designs from the late 70's.
Not recommended with that number of players (might be better with 3)!

This game is unfortunately too dull for the time it takes to play. No real decisions to make , the cards are very limiting, and it is really is very random in terms of trying to protect your coloured houses. Pointless.

With the Divide and Choose using sweet custom dice I would LOVE this game if it weren't for some so-so card abilities and questionable iconography. Thanks to the great core mechanic I can also overlook the art style which is a bit off for my tastes.
So I will say, 'Diamond in the Rough'.

Edição nacional feita pela Kronos Games.

Componentes (cartas de qualidade mediana), dados de ótima qualidade e caixa ok. Manual deixa algumas dúvidas durante a leitura, mas na jogatina a coisa se desenvolve de maneira orgânica.

Jogo divertido para jogar por conta de passar a perna nos parceiros o tempo todo. A simbologia das cartas me lembrou bastante Race for the Galaxy, pela quantidade de símbolos e combinações do mesmo.

Um jogo legal que merece alguns replays.

Unique bidding system, but perhaps needed a few more dice to unlock the strategy. It might be too tight at four players, constraining choice.

RATING: 6
Thief's Market recycles a mechanism for dividing resources I first saw in Mammut, right down to returning one of a set stolen from another player to the central pool.  In Mammut the dividing and re-dividing often drags on too long as everything counts for immediate or cumulative scoring.  Thief's Market has gold to mitigate those poor sets of dice and when it's really not possible to get your first choice card,  a decent alternative is often available.  While that solves the Mammut problem, this game seems to lack tension.

Production quality is OK.  The card art is quite amusing. Some of the iconography is opaque.

Definitely an amusing dice game, plays a little different than many others that I own. I like the thematic act of stealing from the dice pool, and the engine building element with the cards you buy off the market, that open up a lot of scoring opportunities, but do NOT play this with folks that can't handle some direct 'take that' action via dice heist. It's all in the name.

Too long and too short. Too short because frequently you never get the chance to use the special ability on cards you buy. Too long because the mix of so many different cards and symbols drags the game out as players, especially new players and non-gamers, try to work out what's going on. 
I started liking this but have cooled on it pretty quickly. A shame, because I like the I-cut-you-choose element, just not much of the rest of the game.

What a total piece of crap. It's analysis paralysis incarnate, caused by random availability of resources mixed with random goals each round. It's the worst example of a divide and choose mechanism possible. I'd rate it a 1, but there is a game. Just a crappy one. It should be called "Thief of Time."

Beautiful artwork and great main mechanism (I split you choose) but way too many symbols to figure out. And with worrying about the sets, this makes trying to figure out combos from all the different cards (each with different purchasing power) too much of a headache.

Thief's Market, another Kickstarter game... This one wasn't horrible! That's pretty high praise from me for a Kickstarter game lately. In this game you play as a group of thief's trying to control the majority of the loot. This loot is then used to purchase upgrade/victory point cards. For me the interesting part about this game is really dividing up the loot. On your turn you can take as much as you want from the center or another players share of the loot. If you take another players loot you must return one piece of it to the center of the table. This goes on until everyone has some loot. I find it very interesting trying to decide how much loot you can get away with taking. I'll admit though that I was surprised I liked this game.

Plays differently with 3p as opposed to 4p. I'm guessing 5p plays closer to 4p just because of the number of dice in the game.

Certain cards get overpowered depending on the number of players because of the ability (or inability) to buy cards, simply due to the lack of dice. Hence, certain strategies would seem more feasible with different player counts.

Pretty interesting system for allocating resources, whereby a large group dice are rolled, and players go around either taking dice from that group, or stealing dice from other players until the last player without dice finally takes the remaining dice from the center of the table. It kind of feels like some mish-mash of an auction combined with "I split, you choose", and is pretty neat.

Players then use their dice to buy cards, which generally either make you more flexible with your dice, or equip you to score points in some manner. So, there's an element of building up an engine. I was a little disappointed by this element though, as it didn't seem like cards really combo'd, but were more just an assortment of various things, with many of the cards being functionally identical.

Overall, a novel and cool resource allocation system, but I wasn't super stoked about the game built around it. Still good for a filler-type game you can teach in less than 5 minutes, though.

Also, this didn't bother me at all, but this is not a dice game. Just FYI if you saw all the dice and expect a dice game out of this.

[26 Feb 2018] - 6.5 (1 play)
A game of trying to not take too much from the center to avoid having people take your stash of good. It turns out that there are roughly 3 goods per player in a 4 player game. I found that sticking to 2-3 good per round was enough to avoid getting my stash taken in most cases. Unfortunately it's also easy for people at the table to target the same individual and basically run them out of the game. Feels a lot like Munchkin.

It appears as though the designer spent all their time working on a balanced core mechanic.

Unfortunately this basic mechanic is a bit too slow and thinky and with the lack of anything else to make it shine the game loses its personality. The game certainly doesn't feel broken just that there are a lot better games out there at this depth to play and many with a theme closer to your heart.

The game hinges on a pretty cool “I split, you chose” mechanism that also has some things in common with many White Elephant Christmas Gift proceedings, allowing you to take somebody else’s loot.   There are a lot of dice and lot of options so the game ran a bit long with the five of us learning.   Jon had played a prototype version a couple of years ago.   There is a lot of iconography on the cards that is hard to decipher, and the player aid doesn’t really help.   Also, since this is a TMG production, the cards are super-saturated with dark, murky colors.   The art is otherwise really good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The biggest drawback to this game is that it looks more complicated than it is.  My advice would be to just explain each card as it hits the table (5 or so at a time) so that there is no confusion with the iconography.  Other than my group feeling a little lost initially, we liked this fun little filler.  The splitting the loot mechanic was really interesting and we loved building our machines.  After the first few rounds it was smooth sailing.

The simple decision of how many dice to take or steal each turn really is unique and clever. The compact box is also a plus. I just wished the goal of the game revolved around more than a bunch of tired cards that could come from any basic point scoring game.

Artwork is well done, though it may not appeal to everyone.

Nagyon jó kockadobálós, közös poolból választós, egyszerű játék. A kockaelvivési mechanizmus egyszerűen zseniális. Zseniálisan egyszerű, miközben nagyon komoly döntéseket generál. Egyedül talán a kezdőjáték tervezhetetlenségénél éreztem kicsit sántának, de ez se volt vészes. A kártyák komoly kombinálási lehetőségeket adnak, a játék vége felé, már elég bonyolult köröket lehet így generálni. Összességében eléggé CV érzetet ad a játék, a kocka+kártyakombós működés, illetve az rohamosan bővülő lehetőségek miatt, Egy dolog volt elsőre csak fura: a játék vége felé mintha nem annyira érné már meg kártyát venni, ami örökre bergaszthatja a játékot. Remélem ez csak valami véletlen miatt tűnt így, mert kár lenne ha egy ilyen apróság elrontaná ezt az amúgy nagyszerű játékot.

Fun, light game with the stealing mechanics. But the game suffers greatly if you play with any players suffering from AP. With the right set of players, it could be an 8 or 9.

Fun little game where you roll dice and they represent loot, which you have to try and distribute by taking what you want, but may get it stolen if you take too much. You then use the loot you have to buy cards which can help a longer strategy, or just represent victory points.

The game seems a little too short to allow full use of specific mechanics which could give a good efficient strategy, and tends to end just before you really get going with them.

Overall a light weight fun game, but feel it favours just going straight for victory points.

A dice and card game where you play as a rogue who competes with other rogues for the best loot, which is then used to purchase items that help get better loot later! The player with the most prestige wins the game. This game feels a little like Harbour, with a lot of variation and usefuless gained from purchased items. This is a tough game to get the hang of, but has a lot of interesting choices that can be very rewarding.

Nagyon tetszett a kockák elosztásának ötlete, de aggódtam miatta, hogy ne alakuljon át egy folytonos lopkodásá. Viszont azzal, hogy minden tolvajlás után vissza kell rakni egy kockát, ez nem következik be, így az a része kimondottan nagyon jó. A kártyás részben az ikonozással nem vagyok kibékülve. Néhány játék alatt minden bizonnyal gördülékennyé válik az egész, de elsőre azért van értelmeznivaló bőven. Pedig nagyon egyszerű dolgokról van szó. Lehet, hogy itt pont jobb lett volna egy kis szöveg. Az mindenesetre remek, hogy több kártya van, mint amennyire egy-egy játékhoz szükség van, így van benne némi újrajátszhatóság.
A játékidő azért el tud húzódni, mert  vannak szakaszok, amikor egészen gondolkodóssá, kombinálgatóssá válik a játék.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Not my type of game but I expected that since it was a TMG small box game. Players take turns either selecting a group of dice from the loot or stealing someone else's dice (loot) and returning at least one die to the common pile. Actions don't occur until everyone is satisfied. I find this mechanic annoying. The game works fine, the rating is just low because I have little desire to play again.

I liked the constant stealing from other players until an acceptable equilibrium is reached.  The rest of the game is serviceable; I do wish that dice mechanic had a stronger game to go with.

Got this as kickstarter, and TMG quickly drop its price making KS so stupid. Played this game with 2 other players, and it is a medium length dice game that strangely has a game arc. It is difficult to play as starter (as a bit too long, about 1 hour) and not as a main dish (as less strategy compared with most titles), so it's not easy to find a position for this game. Otherwise this is quite a good dice game.

Kickstarted this and played it once. Wife and I both agreeed that this is one to get rid of. A cutthroat game with way too much randomness that isn't lite enough for a quick game and isn't heavy enough to give very good strategy.

If you want a light game with some "stealing" mechanics that lasts about 15 min. then look at H.M.S. Delores. If you want a heavier game with more strategy then look at Libertalia.

(10/16) 4. I think the "I split, you choose" mechanic is undercut by the fact that an even split seems to usually be the obvious play.  That said, it also struck me as a generally dull game and I've only played once, so maybe a different circumstance would have proved to be a better experience, but I'm not really interested in playing again.

(10/17) Drop to 3.

Ok so I KS this thinking my family would like it. I've tried it twice now and we have yet to finish a game. The icons on the cards make it difficult for people to figure out what the cards do which makes them lose interest quickly. Wanted to like it, but just don't.

04/18/17 Played about 85% of a five-player game. I could tell within the first ten seconds I was going to strongly dislike this game. That never changed (if anything it deepened). First, I detest games where the players are forced to be criminals. (First player was determined by who last stole something. ) Then I turned the player aid over and saw 20 different icons defined. That's another thing I can't stand, games that have icon overload.  The main mechanism, stealing dice from each other, left me cold as well. So to me this game was an almost perfect train wreck.

RATING: 8
This game might have perception problems.  It's small, has lots of dice, but it's not really a dice game and it's not really a filler.  Games are much closer to the 50 minute mark (or more) for my group.

With that said, the game is fascinating.  It has a unique and interesting twist of the "I Split, You Choose" mechanism.  Effective play means close scrutiny of every player's tableau and strategy.  This can lead to a longer game than might be expected, but for my group, everyone is invested the whole time, often agonizing over someone else's decision.

The downsides are that it verges on being too long for what it is.  It can also be quite cutthroat.  I also worry that a pure point strategy is a bit too strong, but that's more a group-think issue as it may just be that people keep underestimating point cards.

After 4 plays, the game remains totally engrossing.  I do agree that it's probably best with 4.

Important rules to note:

Card powers happen immediately and more-or-less retroactively on the turn they are purchased.

New players need to be made very aware that coin bags don't turn into coins until the current round is effectively over.

The precise rules wording for individual cards has so far always held up, even if it seemed that "shouldn't be the case".

Many/Most(?) card powers can be used only once on a given turn.  Exceptions are noted in iconography and/or card rules.  There are some notable exceptions.

Don't necessarily use the score tokens to dole out end-game victory points.  VP ≠ score tokens; tokens are *worth* victory points at game end.  The tokens themselves are the second tie break condition.

A nice dice chucking "split and choose" system.
It's like a dice version of Mammut which I really enjoy even though it's so simple.

The unique powers given by the cards here are very nice and fun.

The game seems to suffer from runaway leader issues with a few lucky early purchases.

Surprisingly this is a great little gem, provided you can get three people to spare 45mins or so.

The draft takes a tiny getting used to, but once you have a round or two under your belt the game flows really quickly and is easy to follow.  Not a whole lot of strategy (some, but not much), so this isn't going to cost too much brainpower.

Will be a great game to play with the kids when they are older

Thief’s Market -roll dice to form a central pool then pick some of them. other players can then pick some or steal ones already picked unto all players have some dice. Then use those dice to buy cards for VPs. Very random at best - not for me.

Video Review: https://youtu.be/A-teZBnsKxM

In Thief's Market you are splitting a pool of dice to buy cards which in turn allows you to gain points, manipulate dice, buy more cards etc...

What is nice about this game is that once player one has taken some dice you get to chose whether to take from the central pool or steal from the other players. If you do you must return at least one dice to the pool. This is an excellent dice and card game that is easy to understand and play!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is a nice little game (box wise) and the rules are really easy to teach. There is a slight advantage to repeat plays as you know the types of cards that may come up (a few are removed from each stage so you can't KNOW what's coming up). But you can essentially just explain the varied cards the moment they come up and you can win with a few different methods. This makes novel use of the 'I split, you choose mechanic' because if you try to be too greedy, you essentially loose the splitting power as the next player will steal from you instead of taking what you left them.

White Elephant: The Game. Unlike normal White Elephants, however, whenever you steal things from someone, you have to put something back in the central pool to be taken from. Apart from that, there is some tableau building, but that's about it. The randomness of the dice rolling here kind of bothers me. It's similar to Mage Knight's dice pool, but certain faces can be downright useless at times in this game. I found it alright overall, but not much desire to play again. This is yet another TMG title that is mechanically sound, but isn't exactly fun. I did like the mechanism of dividing up everything though.

Clever and highly-interactive game which steals the Mammut mechanic wholesale - somewhat appropriately, given the theme. A little crafty charm  in the art and card names goes a long way, too. Perhaps the randomness of the dice makes it a little bit less satisfactory than the original, and an inattentive player can make a mockery of the split/share principles. Oh, and why couldn't they make the Start Player marker into a die of its own?

Mainly a rip-off of Mammut (divvying up the spoils), but doesn't do that part quite as well. The cards do add variety, but a lot of randomness as well. Dice as extremely tight; you may not even get to buy a card if you don't get what you need.

RATING: 4.9
This game has an interesting combination of mechanics that should make this game fun but don't. There is a definite run-away leader issue with no legitimate catchup mechanic. Sure players can steal the dice of the leader but it will be at their own expense.

The cards aren't balanced and some just plain don't make sense - for instance the card that provides a discount on all subsequent purchases isn't available until the last few rounds of the game. Too often your best option is to just not purchase anything which does not make for an exciting game.

In summary, if you want a similar game with better balance and more fun than check out Vault Wars or Spoils of War.

In terms of mechanisms, this is not really a dice game. The choices are driven by taking or stealing shares, and the dice are just used to generate the lot that shares come from. The result is rather more thinking and strategy than you'd expect out of a dice game. There should be a concise name for that mechanism, since it has appeared in a number of games -- regardless, this is my favorite game that uses the taking-or-stealing-shares mechanism.

This game has a serviceable core mechanic that could have gone somewhere. Unfortunately, it is hobbled by the designers' baffling insistence on using pictograms to communicate concepts that are absolutely too complex to get across without words. Adding insult to injury, the player reference cards don't include every pictogram, nor do they accurately describe every pictogram that is featured! The only saving grace is that the rules sheet describes the effect of every single card in the game.

I've managed to convince a few different groups to play this with me, and every one of them has walked away from the table confused and unhappy. To salvage this game, I expect I would have to retype, print, and cut up the rules text in order to glue the relevant snippet onto each card. Frankly, I don't believe that the core mechanic is strong enough to justify that level of effort.

The component quality is flawless, though, and I hope to find some use for the custom dice.

有点意思的小游戏，走出了大部分骰子小游戏的套路。游戏的主题是一帮盗贼在酒馆里分赃，不同的骰子代表各种宝石、金钱以及邪恶度（声望），玩家可以从公共堆里拿任意多个，也可以从玩家手中拿全部（然后返回公共堆1个），所以，如果你太贪心拿到很多赃物就会有被别人拿走的风险，而拿的太少又对不起自己的付出~所以游戏的关键在于，你拿取的数量跟种类尽可能的让别人没有兴趣。
当所有人都获得宝石后，进入第二个买牌阶段，用获得的赃物去兑换一些功能卡。当所有的卡牌被买完后游戏立刻结束。

tl;dr: ok game of fighting for scarce resources

Thieves, like pirates, are not the subject of my favorite themes or games. But I won't refuse to try games in which they appear.
This game has a pretty cool dice mechanism where the active player chooses a bunch of dice from the middle, or a set already chosen from an other player. But in that last case he must give up one of those dice to the middle. This leads to a nice situation where you want to take as little as possible to execute your plans, and leave as much in the middle as possible so people don't come and steal the stuff you want.
The problem arises when all the cards (that can be bought with the dice) need a certain color, and very few of those are rolled. Then everyone starts fighting for those or are forced to take things that won't give them much.
In the end it's an OK struggle that is fun for a while, but I got stuck in a situation where I din't have any conversion cards, so I had to have the exact dice to buy cards unless I could get hold of gold. This kind of sucked as other players had built up flexibility and could keep on scoring points.
In the end I thought it was fine for once, but this is not the kind of game that holds much interest for me. Not because I didn't do well, but mostly because doing well usually involves taking stuff from someone else. I prefer to do well by being better, not by denying someone else something.

RATING: 6
I like this quite a bit as a sort of "heavy-filler", it has a lot of tough decisions in a 45 minute game.  You have to constantly try to take JUST enough to get something for yourself, but hopefully not too much that someone will steal what you have.  A fun twist on the "I pick you choose" that's much more interactive.  I could see it getting even more interesting as a regular group starts to learn the cards.  

Downside is that there's a fair amount of down-time, fair amount of AP-inducement, and the game-state is constantly changing so if people start checking out, it just bogs things down even more.  There's a large barrier of entry thanks to confusing iconography, and any time you're teaching the game, you're going to have to be constantly reminding people what every card does.  I really wish they had went with text on the cards instead.

Review Date: May 2017

Positives: Simple to learn the basics. Clever and unusual mechanics of splitting loot/resources. Short game play well suited to its gamestyle. 

Negatives:  Far too many cards have confusing powers/abilities without constant consultation to a guide and therefore useful cards might be missed by less experienced players. Slightly unbalanced points scoring cards? 

Conclusion: Thiefs market had a great idea but only half delivered. It has enough to engage you once or twice, but you might be left feeling a little mislead by the game and slightly cheated

Score: 6, OK game but could have been so much better

This game reminds me of Splendor if you could steal other people's chips.  I like the art and the dice rolling and such, and some of the card effects can be pretty powerful if combo'd with the correct other card.  However, as the game nears the end, AP really sets in as people are trying to remember not only what bonuses they already have, but figure out which available cards are going to net them the most points.  If there was a better way to mitigate that, this might even be rated a point higher.

لعبة عائلية خفيفة ورائعة، هذه اللعبة مليئة باللحظات المرحة إذا لعبت مع مجموعة لعب من أفراد ذو روح رياضية :) بعض البطاقات قد تعطي قوى أكبر من اللازم مما قد يخل بالتوازن في اللعبة، إلا أنه تعدد استراتيجيات الفوز يخفف من هذه المشكلة!

Amikor megláttam, hirtelenjében nagyon megtetszett, aztán játék közben ugyanilyen gyorsan el is ment a kedvem tőle. Az ikonozás fejfájdító volt, egyszerűen nem tudtam a játékra koncentrálni miatta. A dobókockák elvétele viszont jó ötlet, így lehet majd még teszek vele egy próbát vmikor.

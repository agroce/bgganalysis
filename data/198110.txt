Kreo reminds me quite strongly of Hanabi in that you are aiming to play cards in the correct sequence.  Kreo is a little more forgiving in its sequencing, making for a less tense experience. Communication is also limited and comes at a cost. It may have been poor play on our part, but the beads used to pay for communication felt scarcer in Kreo.  There is an option to discard cards to get beads, but that never seemed a good idea.   More often than in Hanabi we were reduced to hoping for the best.  What sets Kreo apart most clearly is its aggression cards with negative effects that you are probably going to have to play at some point.  An important element of the game is  timing the play of these cards to minimise their impact.    That's not quite enough to earn it a place alongside Hanabi in my collection.  

The card quality is good and the artwork is quite pleasant.

After a few games I find it a very difficult game, you can't talk to the other players, any failure will be severely penalized.

Neat, little co-op game where players are not allowed to talk and must deduce how to best set up the players in order to have the chance to win the game. Nice artwork although the theme is pasted on, but very difficult even on "easy" difficulty. One of those games, like Hanabi, where some conventions must be established between players in order to succeed at higher difficulties. Nice challenge!

RATING: 7

[b]The theme[/b]: You are one of the Titans that are cooperatively trying to build a planet. Which is a nice and kind of original theme. But...some of the things just seem weird. Like - you first build heavens, fish and stuff and THEN the planet on which those reside? Huh? What is up with that? Weird things like these just kept our minds away from the theme and the only thing we cared about was to play the correct color of cards (not even sure which elements they were cause that was not interesting enough).

[b]The visuals[/b]: It is a CMON game through and through so the production value is over the top. The illustrations are beautiful, the cardstock good, the little gems nicely done.

[b]The fun[/b]: It provided some nice moments when you managed to syncronise with your coplayers as well as some frustration when they did something totally unexpected and (to your own eyes) stupid.

[b]The gameplay[/b]: If you love coop games and don't have enough, you can get this one. It plays fast, everyone is always engaged and it looks good. However, if you are like me and you already own bunch of coop games (plus you almost never play them as you prefer the competitive ones), then there is nothing special in this one warranting getting it.

RATING: 6
This was played with more communication than strictly allowed by the rules however the mechanics whilst simple are not easy to grasp from the rule book, you pick them up from doing rather than an explanation. I am confident our next play will be more as intended and thus we may find it a challenge.
This one is certainly different from a lot of other games and has piqued my interest.

Looking forward to playing again, but I don't think I would play with 5 players again.

Full Coop. Visuellement peu clair. Un jeu ou on peut pas parler c'est la négation du jeu de plateau. Le jeu est pas affreux par ailleurs mais c'est vraiment pas mon style.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
PROS:
-No poder hablar durante la partida le da unos niveles psicológico, anticipativo y deductivo muy interesantes
-El uso de las piedras de energía le da un toque estratégico a mayores
-Tener que jugar obligatoriamente cartas perjudiciales (cartas de agresión) implica saber seleccionar el momento exacto para librarse de ellas causando el menor mal posible
-Está muy bien calculado para poder ganar solo si se juega muy bien
-Las reglas son muy sencillas de entender
-Incluye cartas de ayuda que son imprescindibles
-Incluye dos modos de juego avanzado que le proporcionan mayor rejugabilidad
-Amplio rango de jugadores (2-6) y funciona bien a cualquier número
-El dorso blanco en las cartas se agradece, ya que, en caso de no estar enfundadas, disimula mucho mejor las pequeñas marcas y arañazos en los bordes

CONTRAS:
-La caja tiene bastante aire
-Si alguien hace un gesto que no debe o hace algo que no debe, la partida puede estropearse

RATING: 5.5
Components: very good quality on cards
Complex: easy to learn and easy to teach
Weight: light/ family
Players: 4 or 5
Length: 30 to 45 mins
Mechanics: play cards and find the pattern of the genesis
Decisions: not much, from cards you have select the one you think will fit
Opinion: you have to discover all elements to make the world, for doing so, you have a set of cards and have to play the appropriate resources to the appropriate elements in order to have all set for the beginning. All players play a card simultaneously, and then they are resolve one by one in turn order. 
The good point is that you cannot talk too much, therefore no Alpha player, but you have to think a lot in the order of the turn, and what is needed, a couple of mistakes and everything is waste.
The art of the game is really cool, is not hard to play, but this is not my kind of cooperative

Gorgeous game. Excellent theme and uique game play. You can communicate your play which is hidden from your team mates, but at a cost of a hard to come by resource so using them has to be at the most opportune moment. The game is about building a planet as a titan strating with the atmosphere, or a comet and going from there. I have nothing bad to say about this game exept like in hanabi. If your team mate makes a bad play it is soul-shattering.

Good silent co-op with communication clues. Provides the players with the opportunity to make some smart moves when utilizing the clues correctly. Mechanically better than The Grizzled, but less thematic.

Played this at Spiel 2016. Nice artwork. Simple rules. But we played it perfectly in the first go. So I'm not sure if we play too many card games or were very lucky. I've gotten the feeling you know very quick what the tricks in the book are.

RATING: 6.5
This is an interesting twist on the Hanabi-style coop.  Players are titans who are attempting to building a planet.  To do so requires that they coordinate to play cards from their hands in a correct and efficient order.

The artwork is beautiful and the game play is solid.  The game would best shine with a group who understand the subtle nuances of limited communication (for example, seasoned bridge players).  Otherwise, I would say that the most interesting part of this game would be lost.

RATING: 7
Looks good and simple conceptually, but the not speaking makes it a bit stressful.  Similar to other co-ops like Hanabi and Okey Dokey but good-looking and unique.  Being colorblind, I wish the differences between the symbols on the colors weren't quite as subtle in the small images.

Very interesting co-op game where players can't talk at all making it a very interesting challenge to play the right card at the right time because in each round all players select the card they'll play at the same time!

RATING: 6
An easy, limited-information, cooperative card game.  It is nice looking, but in a very abstract way.  It kind of feels like a gateway towards games like The Grizzled, Hanabi or Beyond Baker Street -- all of which are more challenging and fun!  Kreus needs an expansion.  As is, it is too simple and deterministic.

The players take on the roles of Titans who try to create a planet. After a few games to fully understand every rule and consequence of your actions we tried it in the suggested "silent mode". The looks and glances of utter joy and total despair when someone played a totally wrong or an divinely perfect card were totally worth it. The artwork is amazing and gets you into the right mood. We have not yet created a stable planet, but even creating one with only two elements made us all feel over the moon.

Beautiful beautiful game. Co-op card game with simultaneous card selection to play to try and build the planet. SO HARD! We haven't even played the advanced rules and this game is so hard. I like co-op games when they are mind games. There is no dictation so that is nice. I have been enjoying my many plays of this. Card stock leaves much to be desired. I wish it was better quality for the cards especially when I paid $25 for like 50 cards.

Have you ever played those alchemist games on mobile where you combince different elements to create more complex things? Now imagine this kind of gameplay in a cooperative way with limited communication like in Hanabi and you'll have a great game of Kreus. :-)

Great little party game that looks awesome, is easy to pick and game time is just right. You can scale the level of difficulty and for more experienced players there are gods who grants players different special abilities during game.

First impression: This is Flowchart: The Card Game. Seriously, you cooperatively put together a flowchart with your friends. With that said, it seems like a fine game. It feels like they took The Grizzled and streamlined some of the fiddlier parts.

Where The Grizzled can be a very difficult game, though, I'm wondering if this one may be too easy. There are only five negative cards and it seems like it is usually easy enough to play them for minimal effect. After that it just becomes a matter of playing all of the other cards without screwing up too much.

They did include a couple of variants to make the game either easier or harder, which is appreciated.

Rating could go up or down with more plays.

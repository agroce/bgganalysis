Simple, but devilish. The arc is odd because individual decisions don't feel terribly high stakes, but it's very enjoyable all the same.

Wow. Great 2 player game, only out-shined by the spectacular 7 Wonders Duel. I would say that this is my 3rd best 2 player game (Patchwork comes in 2nd). 
Really simple rules, short game-play, sufficiently competitive and surprising depth. This is one of those games that you can easily pull out after a long day at work.

Se trata de un juego muy divertido con una puntuación muy curiosa que provoca que haya veces que no quieras llevarte las cartas y quieras dárselas a tu rival. Para ello tiene un mecanismo de selección simultánea de cartas que funciona como una especie de piedra papel o tijera muy cachondo. Hay que intentar averiguar que hará el rival, pero con el faroleo es complicado.

A two player card game about trying to be the best merchant by being just a little bit better than your competitor.  The choices available in the card-based action selection feel quite lacking.  I played one game where I only used Take and Cooperate cards and didn't second guess my choices.  Something missing here, more than just the fun.  5

Otro filler de cartas para dos en la línea de Exploradores o Tranvía, con la gracia de que hay que regular los conjuntos de cartas dependiendo del rival, ya que tan malo es tenerlo muy grande como muy pequeño. Entretenido, aunque no deja de ser uno más.

This game is a quality production with very pretty components and lovely art. It's a fast 15 minute game that I would recommend for couples that enjoy lighthearted games such as [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/50/lost-cities]Lost Cities[/url]. Daxus design is centered around a game of chicken (prisoner's dilemma), where every round either player can gain three cards until the stock runs out. The cards are divided in six categories and scoring is based on the difference between the number of cards possessed by each player and for each category.
 
For me this game was too lighthearted. You'll probably won't back analyze your partners previous choices to see if he or she has a certain playing pattern or intentions in play. In reality you can't (or won't) really strategize which option of the prisoner's dillema to choose. So in the end it just feels a little too random which side the cards go to every round.

RATING: 7
Fun, light two-player game with beautiful artwork on the shop cards. The fact that you're trying to win each shop category by small margins adds an interesting element to set collection and is somewhat thematic. It means that each of the six shop categories stays relevant all the way to the end, even if a player already secured the majority earlier in the game.

Egy nagyon egyszerű, és még annál is gyorsabb kétfős set collection kártyajátékról van szó, amelyben egyrészt a lapok elvitele (4 akciókártyából egyidejűleg választanak 1-et a játékosok, majd azt végrehajtják), másrészt a játék végi pontozás (azt jutalmazza a játék, ha egy színből minél kisebb különbséggel van több nálunk) jelent némi érdekes csavart. Elsőre érdekesnek tűnt, de néhány játék után már nem ébredt bennem vágy a további partikra.

Here you're trying to outguess your opponent. It gets pretty chaotic. You can kind of tell what your opponent should probably do but they know you know that so will probably do something different except when they don't. Iocaine powder problem.

Simple set collection game with a rock-paper-scissors like mechanism to decide who gets which cards. I dislike that mechanism and the rest of the game isn't very exciting.

RATING: 6
On paper, this looked like an entertaining bluffing game, but in practice it was a bit dissapointing. The problem is that it's usually quite obvious what you want to do with the cards on display, so it boils down to pure doublethink on how to achieve that.

Fun filler game.  The variation on area control mixed with Rock, Paper, Scissors was entertaining.  Games that make you get in the head of your opponent seem to appeal to me overall.

RATING: 5.9
If I get to play this consistently with the same opponent, I could see my rating going up... It presents itself like a bluffing game, and to a degree it is, but because it's a strictly two-player affair, you have a great deal of information about your opponent's motivations, which makes it a particularly well-informed game of bluffing. I'm not sure if this is better or worse, really... perhaps it's just presenting an illusion of control? The scoring, which forces you to avoid becoming a runaway leader in a suit, is particularly clever. Maybe a grower, but for now my opinion is mixed.

RATING: 7
Nice game on I think that you think that I think, etc... in which players have to really pay attention to the board and what are their options. First play should be just introductory and the second really shows the game's potential. Overall a very nice 2 player game.

2p game that is set collection and card driven. You have 4 cards in hand and choose to play 1 each round based on the splay of cards that are revealed. It is a mind game so I liked it for that reason. Well I think Ron will do that unless he is thinking this then I should play that. It is cute. I would play again, but I don't think I will own it.

Very interesting game. Delicate balance of power. You want to be winning a row, but by the smallest amount possible. A tight and tense game all the way to the last cards played. As if the difficulty of the decision of what the best move is wasn't already hard enough, making it happen with an rock/paper/scissors outwitting your opponent adds to the complexity. However, the length/difficulty/luck seems to be the right balance.

Two player card game for majority of shops in the central market. Each round, a set of three shop cards are put up to claim or pass.  All or none, they are added to your shops total. Strangely, to score the highest values, it is best not to route your opponent but to maintain a slight advantage while managing your reputation in the market. The signature element lies in when to bluff, and predicting the opponent's play of the four identical action cards. Take, give, cooperate, or undermine! Having to take the random three cards combined with the slight majority, and interaction of the action cards quickly makes it a solid bluff and prediction game.

I thought that there would be a lot more moments of eyeing your opponent trying to figure out what card they are going to play, but for most of the game it doesn't really matter because you still need to collect a fair number of cards. Near the end the fun begins and then it's over. Overall it left me with a 'meh' feeling.

The artwork and the components are great, but it's not enough for me to want to play it when there are so many better games out there.

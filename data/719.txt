RATING: 9
One of those early Euros. Was played a lot and was a lot of fun at the time. The environmental change was very clever and the combat was brutal and fun. Think a lot of designers, e.g. Dominant species used elements from this game in later games. Would rather play this and recommend if over Dominant species as it has lots of combat, creatures running around, interaction and fun and quick. This gives you a much more rewarding "game of evolution and survival" experience than DS does. Update: Played again now 4 players after a 10 year break with 3 other experienced gamers who didn't know the game, huge amounts of fun and the game held up incredibly well, everybody loved it! Rating it a 9 now up from a 7 for what it delivers. You wouldn't say this game was made in 1990, components and systems as a modern day Euro and puts a lot of the like to shame these days. The game has a few "rough" areas and is brutal, but thats what makes it memorable, the possibility of death and extinction at every turn. No candy coated sytems or co-op wherever gets  warm fuzzy and nobody gets hurt. Can't wait to play more again soon. Recommended with 4 players, 2 or 3 not so great.

RATING: 9
A truly splendid game and great fun to play.  Skill required for the manipulating of the climate and 'fun' in the dice battles.  I bought the original and then the AH version.  And the fact that I am posting this in 2015 is an indication that it is still enjoyed by gamers who were brought up on more modern games.  

I advise folk to pick up one of the copies still available for sale if the condition is good (game components were not always so durable back then!).

Not bad for a game from 1990. It's a game of playing creature cards, then playing chits to the board trying to match up the elements your animals need, then trying to boost them up in combat to survive long enough to migrate down the board and score you points.

It was pleasant enough, but the bum luck some players had matching chits to their animals and the length of the game show its age a bit. There's better modern options that do this thing better, but then again, I've played plenty of games that are worse than this.

(Own Moskito Edition)

Like most of Schmiel's game, Tyranno Ex has some unique things going on that I've never seen used in quite the same way anywhere else.

The basic idea of this game is fairly simple: you draft beasties that like 3 different environmental things. You then alter the environment by playing face down disks from a pool of 12. After the change, you can send one of your beasties into a dual with another to try and gain honour, renown, and extra dice modifiers. This continues until someone has no beasties and there are none left to be drafted.

Of course, that is the very simplified version. The best part of this game is probably the environment change, which is unique. The sub-board has 4 areas, one showing the current environment, and another for the possible future. Players place disks into the potential area, and once the number of disks in the potential area is greater than the number in the present environment, the old ones are thrown out, and the environment changes to whatever the most populous disk was in the potential square. This is kind of hard to explain without having the board to reference, but the mechanic is snazzy and it leads to interesting decision trees.

The dice combat thing is heavily augmented by decisions made in the environment phase, as your beasts can get modifiers if you can get all of their climates to show up at once, and you can get more dice to roll if there are a lot of their chosen climates in the present environment boxes.

Perhaps most interestingly, the environment changes can also create a potential way to rein in a leader, as a beast with none of its preferred environment showing at the end of that round will be eliminated from the game. This can often be the only way to rein in a critter with huge modifiers.

If I have any beef with this game it's the length. It takes a while to run through each round. Other than that, I quite like the game. It has a lot of dice rolling, but the modifiers are so significant that it doesn't feel very random.

Another interesting Schmiel game.

Everyone has at least 1 animal.  Each player plays with the food source in order to make their animal flourish and become more powerful.  The animals then fight and the survivors advance for VPs.  Pretty simple in concept, but AH somehow uses a lot of rules to explain it.  But overall, this is one of old-AH's lighter titles that I've played.

Theme is fun, but not very immersive.

An interesting idea that doesn't quite pan out as a two player game... there are too many animals per player to offer any incentive to try and change the environment one way or the other. I imagine it plays much better with 3-4 people. I'd like to try it this way some day. My mediocre rating reflects only the 2-player games I have played. UPDATE: I revisited this one recently, and it was actually better than I remembered. I think my previous rating of 5 may have reflected the fact that the game just wasn't what I was expecting. There are some clever mechanics here. I still think it plays best with 3-4.

It's all about the environment manipulation.  When this becomes apparant to all players, then the vicious extinctions in the early game begins quickly.  Those whom are fooled into thinking this is a combat game can be defeated by the subtle environment player.  Game is far better when played by those who recognize this; as far more tension is created.

So it's got some interesting stuff, and best of all you have dinosaurs fighting other dinosaurs. That said, it's overlong and kind of dumb--you can win by weird timing issues alone.

Interesting Eurogame published by Avalon Hill in 1992 (!)

I'd never heard of this game before finding out about it on BGG.

Not bad, a little on the long side, pretty cut-throat play. A different theme (e.g., microbe-vs-microbe or alien-vs-alien) would have been preferable to the faux-paleontology presented in this game.

Weird marketing -- this game does not model evolution yet that's what it claims on the box. The back goes on and on about evolution and how precious the environment is. All well and good, except it has almost zero to do with the game that comes in the box!

This is a game about forced extinctions due to the actions of the players (the gods?) and as such is not based on science and is not a simulation. It is a Euro with abstract mechanics and a pasted-on theme.

Now I knew this when I traded for the game, but imagine the disappointment of someone buying the game thinking they'd get the game advertised on the box...

The box is way too big for the components; it's mostly air in there. A bookcase-sized box would have been much better. Finally, what's the deal with an aqua box. AH definitely didn't generate any sales with their color choices!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I enjoyed this. It's different.  It's a very chaotic game in which players control the environment in an attempt to make it more hospitable for their preferred creatures--so far, it sounds a lot like Die Macher, except that here your animals attack and kill each other. It is, however, a much lighter game, with less going on than the aforementioned giant, and a shorter play time.

There's certainly a good amount of tension and take-that in the way that the environment changes, and things happen in a narrow enough window, and with enough dice-rolling, that even your weak dinosaur usually has a non-zero chance to succeed.   However, the one problem with the game is that it is possible to make your animal so strong that the dice rolling becomes unnecessary and it simply kills everything in its path.  

Anyway, a good game, worth trying and very different from anything else I know of. (1 play)

Abstract review: This is an agressive stock game where players draft creatures and then battle it out for survival.  Each creature prefers 3 of (8?) different attributes which the players control in a unique stock-manipulation mechanic that ultimately determines the players ability to fight.  The stocks work as multipliers to determine how many dice are thrown.  If all three of a creatures stocks are showing during a phase they can choose to strenghen their creature (so if strength is 1 it moves to 2, meaning a 2 from a 6d will hit).  When creatures fight the most dice hits win and a creature who wins and has an equal or lesser strength gets 1 point stronger.  There's a lot more going on and it's a fun game if you don't mind the dice and the fact that you'll be bashed if you're the leader.

Survival is the key to this game--you're competing with others to create an environment where your "team" of dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures can thrive.  The longer your creature lives, the more victory points you can accrue.  The environment then determines how powerful you are in a round of dice-based combat.  Combat winners become more powerful, losers either fail to score points that turn or even become extinct.  The game does have a fair amount of luck and confrontation, particularly with the dice-based combat, but I found it to be a tense and enjoyable experience regardless.

MAN oh MAN is this hard to get on the table.  After years of trying to push this I finally convinced people to play this.  I really enjoy it.  It probably is a bit too long for what it offers, but if you take out a few cards you should be able to adjust the length of the game.  

I love the interaction of the moving parts.  Really this is a very simple game, where you pick what you want to put on the conveyer belt, then you try to boost the powers or get a better choice of chits to boost the number of dice you are going to roll.  Even though it is very abstract, it is fun rolling off against one another, and I certainly feel a sense of attatchment to my cool little animals.  

I'd gladly play this again on request.

The current environment starts out with a random mix, but players can slowly modify it to try to best suit their own animals. They can also each attack one other animal, with combat based on the animals level and strength (which improve as you win more fights and match more elements of the current environment). At the end of the round, animals that survive (being attacked by others, or environmental changes -- need to match at least one element) advance on a conveyer belt style board, and score VP; the longer an animal sticks around, the more VP you earn.

Really, a pretty neat design, especially the way the environment changes. But there was just too much randomness in the order animals became available, and the dice-based combat. Also, winning combat early makes you stronger and stronger -- hard to catch up with those animals. And worst of all, you have to depend on people figuring out who's actually winning ... and not attack the person already in last place when it makes no f-ing sense!

Can see the antecedents of Dominant Species here. However, despite some interesting mechanics it overstays it welocme and has a weak get weaker problem.

A very Euro optimization game. Dinosaur games for me are generally something to play with kids, and for that I prefer something chancier and with better integrated theme.

Maybe I didn't get it, but I didn't like the mechanics and found it long. The theme is interesting.

It actually feels like a Euro, IMO. I'm pretty impressed with the design, even if I found it frustrating to accomplish what I wanted to during the game. =)

The cards have nice pics of the creatures involved, but the board lacks that visual dynamism that would enhance this very strategic game.  The climate adjustment mechanism is clever if a bit abstracted.  Would love to see a remake of this with a more concrete treatment and more exciting art and graphic elements.

A strange game that is primarily environment evolution bidding mixed with dicefest dino battles. It comes together better than one would think, but definitely overstays its welcome as games can tip past the 2 hour mark. Shorten it by removing a round or two of cards ahead of time.

Wow. A classic Avalon Hill Karl-Heinz Schmiel masterpiece. Players draft dinosaurs and other prehistoric beasties to duke it out on the evolutionary stepladder. Only the fittest survive to get points. Great interactions between drafting the critters, manipulating the environment, and the bucket-o-dice combat mechanics. As satisfying as Kremlin, but a whole lot less convoluted.

Only played this once or twice and then stuck it away.  My daughter remembered it though, and I just gave it to her.  If she likes it, we could be playing it again.

It's pretty much as the summary describes it.  There's a bit of gang up on the leader that can be over done in a 3 player game but many games have that problem.  All in all it's a fairly interesting game that gives a player lots of options on every turn.  I particuarly like the mental image of some of the dinosaur battles.  Although in our game T-Rex got himself up to a 6 (automatic hit on every die) which is pretty much true to life.

Want to see one of the influences on [gameid=62219]?  Check out those round counters with the skull, seed, etc! 

The gameplay is sort of an inverse of [gameid=1159], where you're trying to make sure the environment best matches your creatures.  A somewhat disconcerting blend of old-school [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/publisher/5]Avalon Hill[/url] dice-rolling and combat with some very Euro mechanics to influence the environment.  Good hybrids will blend mechanics seamlessly, but this game has a somewhat jarring shift from environment influence to dicefest combat.  

The components in the Avalon Hill version have a definite 80s retro charm, but are often rather fiddly.  It'd be nice to have some kind of VP chips, and marking the frequency and the strength is frustrating, and probably could have used some larger cardboard tiles.  Only worth looking into for those who are really into the theme.

Fun evolution game where you attempt to control the environment to make your creatures thrive.  Battles seem particularly long and the [AH] game needs more dice to keep combat from dragging.  Nicely balances luck and strategy.

Great game. I think. I&#039;ve yet to find someone interested in playing, since it&#039;s too complicated for most people in my family.

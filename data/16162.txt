What a fun little game for only $5!  I played my 1st session of this as the Allies and I came up 1 bridge short.  The game really makes the allies feel like they are on the clock as it should.

RATING: 8
Very clever game, all the flavours, all the goodness but the sauce has been reduced to the point anyone can play it. The game is particularly good at showing the differences between the German forces (good attack but cannot take too many hits) and XXX Corps (less oomph than you'd think but with a capacity for losses that is awesome).

It teaches some sensible military lessons without as much of the positional stuff as we used to have in the Napoleon At Waterloo series.

It is a very good introductory game because of its size, but a very good wargame because of its design.

This 8 rating is based on the BGG chart, it's an 11 using typical ratings.

This is based on one solo play so who knows how it will hold up.  It's a great intro game with only 2 pages of rules.  I'm new to wargames and this is the first that I was able to play right away after the first rules reading.

Its pretty fun to play solo too!

UPDATE: I've played a few games against another person and have raised my rating.  This is a great game for introducing newbies.  It's quite a challenge to win with the allies (it's Market-Garden, after all) but it's fun either way.

RATING: 7
A good introductory hex-and-counter war game. The scenario doesn't ever change, so replayability might be limited, but for those who want a fairly quick (relatively speaking) Market Garden game, this is it (and not just because of the price).

May 3, 2008 -- On my fourth play of the game, I introduced another person to it (on each play, I've played a different opponent), and he opted to take the Allies. I now really understand what good German play can do to the Allies. Although the Allies' 82nd took Arnhem immediately, he was forced out by the end of the fourth turn. My units concentrated on destroying his supply centre, which did irreparable damage to his campaign.

While I feel I've pretty much played this game out, I still think it's a good, enjoyable and short introductory war game. My rating stays the same. 7/10

Players take on the Allies or the Germans, and recreate the Arnhem campaign during World War II.  Very simple giveaway game from MMP.  The game comes with around 80 counters, and simple A3 mapsheet, and 2 pages of rules.  There are nine turns in the game, broken into 3 impulses per turn.  During an impulse, a unit can either move, fight or resupply.  Quick playing, tense game.  The Allies have to clear the highway before the German reinforcements swarm on board, and it's not easy.  Good fun for a few plays.

A free wargame with excellent components, for a free game. I've paid more for DTP games that are not at this production standard. (I'd give an extra point in the rating just for that!) The game play is reasonable - more subject to randomness, given the simplicity of the system but the short playing time makes this acceptable (slightly less than 2 hours).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A good step up after [gameid=23957]. Good light intro to wargaming for newbies, although potentially difficult for eurogamers to learn.  Germans have the advantage (especially if they stack mechanized units in a city on the other side of a bridge), and it arguably lacks replayability because playing as Germans isn't that interesting and the same optimal strategy is needed for Allies to have a chance.  For balancing, some recommend changing German supply to 1/3 of a d6 instead of 1/2 a d6.  Counters are fiddly.

One can't ask for much more with a free game. It's an intersting battle with good components and easy to understand rules.
So far it has proven to be very hard for the Allies to meet the victory conditions even if everything goes just right early on. The good thing is that it's quick enough to play that you feel like trying different openings.  If it were a longer game it might not be worth the effort.

A genuine introduction to wargames, and you get the good with the bad --- errata, a graphic design that gets it mostly right but a few things wrong, subtlties in the rules you are bound to miss the first time through, and a remarkably clever and entertaining game experience to be had if you apply some effort and push through to the finish. Good history, too. The best part is that you don't have to pay forty bucks to buy this in a box, or wait out a pledge for future publication -- the game is available for cost of postage direct from the manufacturer.

RATING: 7.5
This is a tough game for the Allies to win, especially if you do anything remotely like the historical set-up of spreading the paratroopers all across the battlefield. 

It feels somewhat unusual for a wargame as you can keep spending supply points to remove damage from units. The supply points for the Germans are limited, but my co-worker keep getting pretty maximal amounts. So I'd make 2-1 and 3-1 attacks and he's remove the damage the next turn. Of course, that limited him from attacking...

I like the three-impulse structure of the turn, and the way only the armor units can act again in the third impulse. It gives a nice feel for the armor advantage, and the limitation on one action per impulse keeps the player involved making trade-offs.

Very light game reminiscent of Command magazine's style.  Nice components, attritional combat system.  Gameplay features some interesting action along Hell's Highway, but victory seems to be determined around Arnhem, where the Germans launch no-brainer attacks against the city or the dropsite while the British engage in a very gamey shuttling of units between the two.  For the price of $5 S&H it's certainly worth a look, but I preferred GDW's offerings in the convention freebie genre.

Only played once; may do so again if the mood strikes, but unlikely (hence 5).  Great components and idea, but two main things make this game not much fun for me:
1.  Odds based CRT.  Just not fun figuring out the ratios.
2.  Very fiddly components.  I just don't have the fingers to manipulate stacks of up to 6 counters in the midst of other stacks of counters.  Again, for me, not fun.

These are obviously personal opinions which show I'm not really cut out for 'traditional' wargames of this mould.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Low complexity, fast playing game. The basic system is sound and actually encompasses quite a lot with a small amount of rules. (but, because of how condensed they are, you'll want to read them carefully and it may take more than one game to get them down)  Combat is odds-based, but units can attack more often than in a regular wargame and accumulate hits (becoming eliminated once these reach their endurance value) - this process makes for a much more interesting mechanic than the standard Napoleon at Waterloo model typically chosen for 'introductory' wargames.

Unlike most introductory games, both players can be attacking simultaneously as the Germans nibble at Arnhem and the highway while the dogged Allies push forward to open the bridges and secure the city.  Much depends on the drop zones chosen by the Allied player - do not (I repeat) do not use the historical drop zones. (after all, they didn't work historically...)

I liked it on first experience - it seemed to have at least a couple playings in it, which isn't bad at all for the price.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun little game - plays in about one to two hours.  I paid $5 for S&H, otherwise it was free.  Offers some replayability as the Allies can use historical drop zones or select their own drop area.  A nice extremely simple & quick wargame.

This is the perfect introductory war game and is a 10 when rated as such but is not really that appealing to avid/experienced wargamers - so split the difference and get a rating between 6 & 7.
New war gamers - watch A Bridge Too Far then play the game.  (or vice versa)
2/21/07 - MMP is no longer shipping this - it is only available at cons.

I have used this one to introduce hex & counter to a few people - very successful!

Alternate set ups work great for a quick solo study.
Maybe 10 plays in total.  Lost shine for me, but still an excellent introductory game.

Very enjoyable wargame which allows for clever tactical play with a highly streamlined ruleset.  The short playing time and lack of complexity makes this an ideal introduction to traditional hex and counter wargames.  It is one of very few wargames that I can actually get to the table. Thanks, MMP!

Target Arnhem gives me just about everything I want from an operational level Arnhem game without the long playing time of (say) Airbridge to Victory.

The lack of bridge-demolition rules seems a bit odd at first (and reduces the urgency of capturing some of the bridges) but is more than made up for by the excellent feel for the XXX corps advance and the German counter-attacks.

Another small criticism is that good German die rolling can see Arnhem fall much more quickly than historically and this makes the game very difficult for the Allies to win.  Still the game is short enough to swap sides and play twice in a typical evening session.

Congratulations to MMP for giving this away for free.

An introductory wargame in the tradition of Napoleon at Waterloo or Battle for Moscow. It's small, it's simple, it's quick. It's also a real wargame, fully historic in its treatment of the subject matter. In those respects, I really like this little package. (The price was right, too.)

As for the game itself, there's not a lot for the German player to do but hold off the Allies' onslaught. Not the most exciting unless you're visualizing the actual events. The Combat Results Table only has attacker/defender hits, not any retreat results. That makes it awfully tough for the Allies to extract the Germans from their defensive positions.

The combat system is similar to the Command & Color system, where "step losses" represent eroding morale leading up to a unit's collapse, but no reduction in fighting ability.

Great little treatment of the paratroopers in this game, and some simple but effective (and interesting) supply rules, too.

Excellent introductory wargame. From a paltry two pages of rules you get a game with passable simulation elements, some hard tactical choices, exciting combat and enough historical flavour to muck about with "what-if" scenarios. If that's not enough for you there's a solo variant, it has good production and is cheap/free. I particularly like the abstracted off-board movement and supply for German reinforcements which seems to capture the essence of the dangers of operating behind enemy lines. It does have serious re-playability issues though, as certain allied tactics are required for them to have any chance of success.

Neat little game that will expose new players to a surprising number of traditional wargaming concepts: zones of control, line of supply, terrain effects, road movement, odds-based CRT and column shifts, hits, advance after combat, supply points, mechanized exploitation, off board movement, and victory conditions. My only critique is that some tactical hints should have been included in the player's notes, given the game's intended audience--since the allies can drop anywhere on the map I can imagine a brand new player will be left wondering where to start, what makes for a "good" move.

No rating as I have no great interest in the subject itself, but MMP is a class act for handing this out as a giveaway.

Nice "little" wargame that plays fast, but still gives you the feel of a wargame.  I find it hard for the Allies to win this scenario as all the Germans need to do is occupy one hex on the road at the end of the game.  Free from MMP with paid postage.

Target Arnhem is an elegant design with only two pages of rules.  It does a great job simulating Operation Market Garden for such a small game, but its the game's smallness that brings down the rating; there are very few options for either player.  It's tough for the Allies to win and it seems like the 9th & 10 SS can wipe out the British in Arnhem faster than they did historically.

Surprisingly good beer and pretzels Operation Market Garden, with only two pages of pretty solid rules.  Note that the Germans can give up on Arnhem and move the SS units by offboard movement to the area between Son and Grave, or Nijmegan if it holds.  A variant to balance the game is to give the Germans supply at 1/3 (rounded up) of 1d6 rather than 1/2, and I give the game an 8 with that variant, which greatly enhances replayability for me.  Given to JoeyD; Steve; Michael P.; Jacob R.; Ryan/Esther; Seth.

Everytime that I get ready to play this game, I take out the old Attactix game ARNHEM BRIDGE and play it instead.  Very similar game, same exact subject, with nicer unit and map IMO.  The Attactix game satisfies my hankering for this subject and TARGET ARNHEM goes back on the shelf unplayed again.  I asked one time on BGG for someone to explain the major differences in these two games but nobody responded to my question. (There are some differences, but not enough to make me change my slightly low ranking for TARGET.)

This game can be quite frustrating for Allies and boring for Germans. If the Allied lose their  foothold on the Arnhem side of Neder Rijn, the game deteriorates to a war of attrition with Allied player rolling attacks on 1-2 or 1-3 column while German player tries not to roll 1's for resupply. Not very fun or exciting. Free game, and good component quality, but the gameplay feels pretty limited.

Just my style these days. Great little intro hex and counter game on a battle that fascinates me. 

It seems that despite complete flexibility on where to drop his paratroopers, The Brits, not the Americans, better take Arnhem on turn one. After that it's a challenge for the Allies. If ya don't do that, it's an exercise in futility. But after some more plays I might be wrong about that.

Too slow, too little action for the German player, too little chance for the Allies to win. This game would be eminently more playable with some sort of Victory Point system. The absolute victory terms punish the Allied player unnecessarily. 

Despite all of the above though, your $5 would not be wasted, and it has some above-average graphics for both the map and counters.

After 30 years of playing Strike Force One, I figured it was time to step up a level to a game with a big map and a lot of units... Just kidding!

Seriously, Target: Arnhem packs a lot of punch in a small package. Against solid German play, I think the Allies have at best a 10-15% chance of winning, but trying to do so is a lot of fun.

An excellent choice for someone wanting to learn how hex and counter wargames work.

I was overwhelmed on my first two plays, which were solitaire.  As a non-wargamer, I found it difficult to keep track of all the information involved.  Did I move the impulse marker?  Did I activate this unit already?  Did I adjust the supply marker when I healed that last point of damage?  The third time I played was with a friend, and halfway through I finally got to the point where it all clicked.  The game was more playable, ad I could focus on the strategy and not the mechanics.  

Now that I play wargames all the time and have figured out what appeals to me, I don't play this anymore, but it served its purpose of getting me familiarized with wargames, particularly classic hex-and-counter conflict simulations.  If you're interested in the battle, or if you have a friend watching Band of Brothers who wants to try a wargame, it's a good pickup.

Friday Night at CABS I played the Six Bridges to Arnhem freebee that MMP was giving out at Origins, against David Mignerey. Previous experience with this game was that I played Steve and was the Germans. This time I was the Allies. I learned from Steve's turn 1 mistake and captured Arnhem turn 1 with the British airborne. From there, things went pretty well.

Oh, I have to explain a bit about the game mechanics.

This system looks like it could be applied well to other simple situations. It is pretty simple actually. A turn is broken into three impulses. A unit can do any of three things, move, attack, or be 'resupplied' (which is a bad term for what it does, more later). Only mechanized units may use the third impulse of a turn.

All units have identical movement, so it's not a value printed on the unit. Movement is either 2 hexes, 1 hex for crossing canals or entering woods, any distance on the highway, or not at all across a river without a bridge. Movements basically don't mix, no entering a highway and then zipping along for instance. ZOCs only affect movement, stopping it immediately on entry, but not preventing infiltration nor supply tracing.

Printed on the units are four key items that matter a combat value, an endurance, "supply" related affiliation, and unit type (mech vs leg). During combat, a unit takes damage, and when the damage equals the endurance, the unit is destroyed. Combat is simple odds, so that's all familiar territory to everyone. Terrain is pretty simple, either it halves (cross water) or it shifts one column on the CRT. You can spend a "supply" point to do concentrated bombardment and get a column shift on attack too.

Supply is two concepts. Normal supply which affects units is almost never an issue for the Germans, you'd have to occupy every surrounding hex to cut off supply. Allies trace to either an airdrop supply point, or to the entry edge for the British XXX corps. Supply points accumulate for the germans and the airborne divisions, but there is an infinite supply of points if you can trace the Allied units off the XXX corps entry point. The "resupply" option allows you to spend a point to repair 1 point of damage on a unit (only 1 per phase). The other use of the supply points is the concentrated bombardment (allied infantry can't do concentrated bombardment- they're all airborne and don't have heavy guns with them anyway). The Germans are shy of supply points and need them to keep their few strong units intact so rarely spend on concentrated bombardment.

The entire goal of the game is for the allies to open the road to arnhem and control it at the end of the game, the germans to prevent that. The Germans have a lot of weak infantry units and a few strong combat value weak endurance value mech units. If the Germans can concentrate (stacking is 3) at any point behind one of the rivers, with strong mech units, preferably in a city, the Allies will never push through, that's what happened with my game with Steve. Conversely, if the Allies manage to hold Arnhem and destroy one of the big (6-3) SS mech units, the Germans are pretty much toast. That's what happened in my game with David.

The game may have some replay value, and since it's a fast learn, fast play (you have the majority of the rules here in this post), it's a good 1 hour or less game. I am curious if the mechanics could be used in something else effectively.

Essentially, this is a good intro to wargaming title, simple, fast, easy, interesting.

Fun and free while you could get it from MMP ($5 to cover postage). It is a good way to introduce people to hex and counter wargaming. I was playing this with both of my teenage sons and they got it pretty quickly. The Germans seem to have the adavantage. It is a very interesting scenario but your choices are fairly constrained by the map, time line, and units. This is probably good for the type of product it is but I do not think it has the replayability of more substantial wargames.

So good! Both sides have such an interesting challenge ahead of them. If you haven't played yet, the main tension in the game comes from the Franks player waiting for the Crusaders - the English, French, and Germans - to arrive from Europe. Each round, the Franks draw a block from a face down pool - if it's a Crusader, the block is added to a waiting room on the board. Once all three of a given set of Crusader (once again, English, French or German) show up in this waiting area, they can deploy onto the map.

At the start of the game, most of the Franks draw pool are Crusaders. However, as "Outremer" blocks - ie, those knights with holdings in the Middle East - die out, their blocks are added to the draw pool. Since the Crusaders are the Franks most organized and powerful blocks in the game, this effectively dilutes the draw pool and delays the troop surge.

So, for the first half of the game, the Franks sole aim is survival of the Outremers, waiting for the Crusaders. They really have no chance at winning unless they do this. The Franks challenge, then, is to keep their Outremers safely nestled in castles (double defense) while they send out the fairly powerful Templars and Hospitallers (who don't clog the draw pool) to wreak havoc upon the encroaching Saracens using their dangerous Knights Charge ability. 

It may seem bleak for the Franks, but the Saracens have their own problems. Their advantages are that they're very fast, so they usually strike first in combat and can move farther in a single turn. During the early game, it's also a mixed bag counterattacking against them because of their Harrying ability (attack   retreat simulteneously). 

The Saracens are weak in firepower, and most all of their units are removed from the game when they get eliminated. So, their best bet is a hardline push during the first 3/4 of the game, followed by turtling in safety, perhaps with a bit of Harrying, in the final few years.

RATING: 7
(1st edition) My first block wargame and I own it only because I got it as a gift; otherwise would never buy it - horribly overpriced. 

Like the theme a lot; the mechanics are simple although the rules are a bit unclear/snippy at times.

1st ed. definitely favors the Saracens. Measures were taken in the 2nd ed. to solve the problem, but it's still there unless you play with Iron Bridge optional rule.

RATING: 7.25
This rating may go up or down on extra plays...I've only played once so far.

This is a good and enjoyable game with a lot of things to recommend it.  However, I did find there were quite a few rules questions that weren't covered by the existing text and needed intuition to answer.  Usually, concise rules are a good thing, but here I feel more examples of play and some FAQ-type solvers would have been a VERY good thing.  I would advise Columbia to add extra detail into the next printed set of rules - probably mostly as an add-on section rather than within the main text.

The Wintering rules made for a much slower game than I imagined...somewhat like Wilderness War - but this is both less complicated and sophisticated  than that game. The latest rule changes certainly help to balance the game - I wouldn't say that the Saracens have a big advantage as Winter is more of a problem for them, and pieces for both sides come onto the board quicker now. There can be a lot of die rolling, but I personally don't object to that.  

So far, I'd say it was fun and good but not a classic.  It does benefit from being on a theme that is interesting and little visited.  As I get to know the game, my opinion may change.

The operational nature (movement point to point) of this game, makes it one of my favorites of the Columbia block games.
The combat it's the classic a-b-c-d. But then you have sieges, herrasing mounted archers and Knight Charges!
The timely arrival (or not) of the Frank reinforcements brings a Fun strain to the playing of this title.

Played several games with the new version of the rules.
The previous winter supply version was not good because  allowed the unhistorical maintenance of great armies, BUT... the new winter supply restritions are too severe to the Franks/crusaders and IMO umbalances the 
gameplay.
The Crusaders should be able to duplicate the winter quarters in coastal cities.
The new siege/assault rules are a improvement and now it makes much more sense to close inside the castles.

Columbia continues to maintain the enervating policy of sending to the market unduly developed games and putting customers as playtesters.
Playing time: 2-3 hours

I haven't formed a final opinion on this, but I think the 2.1 rules were a step in the right direction.  1.4 was too imbalanced.  I was impressed with the little bit of 2.1 that I did get to play.

I finally had the chance to play this game, and it was great just like I hoped.  I really ejoyed Hammer of the Scots, and this is another triumph in the block game series.  I played the Franks, and the fluidity and speed of play was more than I expected... therefore I feel that I was fast on may way to a massive defeat.  But that is not known since we had to cut it short due to weather related issues.  Anyway, fabulous game, I would recommend it to anyone that like war-games or strategy games, and I cannot wait to play it again.

First impressions of Crusader Rex were not good; on reading the rules it seemed like a Hammer of the Scots clone with a long, thin map familiar from Liberty. In fact, it plays quite differently.

In HotS the situation too often resolves into the Scots in the Highlands and the English in the lowlands, fighting over a few areas in the middle.  In Crusader Rex forces and victory areas are spread right across the map.  This makes it a strategically more interesting game.  The constant challenge for both sides is to concentrate sufficient force in one place. The Frankish charges, Saracen harrying and the sieges also give the gameplay a distinctive flavour.  Using the version 1.4 rules, it seems, on early acquaintance, a well-balanced game.

There are a few negatives. As many others have commented, the map is too small, with stacks of blocks obscuring key information.  As ever, Columbia has been miserly with markers.  Something flippable to show a siege in its first turn and beyond would have been helpful. Considering that we're on the fourth published draft of the rules, it is inexcusable that they are still full of holes and ambiguities.  Finally, after carefully conserving forces throughout the game, the final turn no-tomorrow assaults are a jarring bum note.

Far from perfect then, but quite enjoyable.

RATING: 8
Exiting and fast-playing wargame. Too bad that many rules were changed after publication, but that certainly has improved the game. The game suffers from a last turn syndrome. If you controle 4 or more cities, concentrate all your forces there, only waiting for your claim of an easy victory.

The game is actually about the 7 VP-cities. The other points are only meant to delay the enemy.

Armies didn't march along multiple roads to encircle an enemy force in those days. It was a later invention!

Winter attrition in a subtropical area where many Crusaders have died of thirst!? A bit odd.

I did not like the abstracted way Egypt is depicted in this game.

I've only played two, half games so far so this is just previsional. After buying this off the back of Hammer of the Scots it was a little bit of a disappointment. While I was considering this as an addition, I thought 'seiges, knight charges, muster, harry' great! But after playing, they seemed more hassle than they were worth. 

This was probably just me and my opponents bad tactics but all our men were just camped in the victory points cities most of the game and just slugging it out between them. It seemed less tactical than Hammer of the Scots. I really do need to get some plays of this under my belt, because after reading all the reviews and having played it I know it has potential. It's hard to stop reaching for Hammer of the Scots though.  

Update: I never really got to grips with this game or had enough motivation to get this to the table. Hammer of the Scots was just too easy to reach for when looking for a simple two player war game. Sold it.

Crusader Rex is the only block game I have ever played. I don't know why I waited so long to try one- I've been wargaming since 1980! It certainly is a lot of fun, even if the amount of dice rolling required to resolve battles seemed excessive at first. The wristage is acceptable, though, because the number of battles that occur during a game is relatively small.

I loved Hammer of the Scots, and this is an interesting continuation of that type of game with some new mechanisms to represent a different scenario.

With only a few plays we've had a hard time figuring out how to play effectively with the Crusaders.  I believe it's possible, but it hasn't clicked yet.  When it does, I suspect that this rating will rise.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Love the narrow, long, congested map.  Theme presence is good although I'd like chromier units.  Road movement is clear and cool.  A couple plays with 1.3 led to Saracen blowouts, and a long languish on a shelf until it was finally picked back up in November 2009 with 1.4.  Rules were quite readable although a few seemingly common situations were unclear (e.g. knight's charge while defending a castle storm).  Mud is just potentially huge and scares off already-tough sieges.  Seems to me that unless the Saracens cause a lot of early bloodshed the game is in for more turtling than tactics, followed by a gamey all-or-nothing on the final round.  I think the Frank outlook has improved considerably with the latest rules revision, but I'd like to see tighter rules and a more flexible endgame.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Solid system, interesting strategic situation (far more so than hammer of the scots). Neither player (especially the Franks) can be strong everywhere and the map provides for a good number of options and possibilities. Road based movement is superior to HOTS's area based movement.

The Saracen bias seems to have been fixed by updated rules and revelations in strategy.

The Franks must preserve their forces in the early game and moving Guy into Tripoli is a good idea.

The Saracens on the other hand need to get out of the gate quickly, seize an objective or two and then use their harrying ability to full effect in order to tie up and attrit the Franks.

In my humble opinion it is not balanced enough. If the crusader-player cannot land its troops due to lack of fortunate dices, he is very basically screwed. The muslim-player can on the other hand easily concentrate its forces and remove one enemy strongpoint after the other in a very short time (if like in my case the crusader-dices are cursed!!!).  Very slim rulebook that leaves to many questions that arise during gameplay unanswered. You need support to clear that. Would I buy it again? Yes absolutely!

RATING: 9
Oct 2011.  Lowered rating from 9 to 5  due to poor 2nd ed rules that turn a great game into an average game.  Obvious that Columbia fiddled with rules right up to last minute, so you can be sure the final version was not play tested.  Instead, they decided what final tweaks they felt were needed, made them w/o further testing, and went "final." (At least sure looks that way.)  Result, in their haste to publish they did bad things at last minute for what they thought were right reasons--with predictable results. And rules still untidy.   Sad, because it could have been a "10."   Several of us already developing "House Rules" to "fix" game.   Keys:  (1) Crusaders deploy 1 per group, not 1 per block.   (2) Restore Knight's Charge.  (3) Set up WITHIN kingdoms, otherwise Franks can, and will, abandon Antioch.(4) Initiative ties to Saracen until 1st Crusader group arrives, then Franks. (5)  Toss "Intrigue" card, because it's stupid.  (6) Initial Saracen draw back to 6. Also considering following: make Jerusalem worth 3 points--because that's what the Crusades were all about, and since Saracens cannot take Tripoli now that it can be resupplied by sea, meaning Saracens must take 4 of remaining 6 Victory Cities to win.  If Jerusalem 3 points, then Saracens can win 5-4 by taking Jerusalem (as they did historically) plus 2.  Also Jerusalem would be an "open city," providing winter replacements to whichever side holds. After all, Jerusalem was a holy city to both.
===============

Fascinating, decision-rich play.  Once balance issues sorted out (Columbia never gets it right on 1st try, and sometimes 2nd, too).  I think they over-corrected in favor of Franks. Original rules + knights charge + free arrival of crusader groups was all that was necessary.  Now, too hard for Saracen to winter in towns in his own country.  Maybe Columbia will tinker with it again.  Still a great, meaty, block game.  Cerebral Hammer.

Fun if unbalanced (against the Franks) during the first few iterations of the rules. Finally managed to score a win with the Franks with ver. 1.4. I'll have to play a few more games to see if the balance issues have finally been fixed.

I wanted to love this game.  The subject matter intrigued me and I am generally fond of block games.  That being said, I was completely underwhelmed by the effort Jerry Taylor and Columbia games put into this game.  The game felt very incomplete.  We had to pretty much guess at a number of the rules because they were not well defined in the rulebook.  I think we played the game correctly but I have a nagging feeling that maybe we misinterpreted something.

Overall the game seemed fairly good but the experience of learning it with that set of rules was frustrating.  I am actually amazed at the amount of critical acclaim this title has received.  If Hammer of the Scots is anything like this I will avoid buying it until I know it has a rule set that is more or less water tight.  The same goes for anything designed by Jerry Taylor.

My favorite game company stumbles badly.

Columbia's habit of devoting their full attention to final development only shortly before publication resulted in a product with serious play balance issues.  Last minute changes cannot be adequately tested. Basic features such as the style of map (hex or area) are often not set with only a month or two left before production.  

Columbia's last two new games, Crusader Rex and Gettysburg, have both required post publication changes in order to make them playable. While this may be acceptable to fans of Columbia's games, it is not acceptable to casual or first time buyers.    

Potential buyers of new Columbia games are better off waiting six to tweleve months for the inevitable post publication changes required to polish and finish the game.  

More than three months after publication 
the game is still undergoing final development. Totally unacceptable that earns the game a "1" rating. 

706/06 Note: A revised rulebook supposedly correcting play balance issues was published.  The game is more of an alternate history than a game of the actual campaign.

RATING: 7
Great game!  Columbia games should just *STOP* making games with hexagons, and concentrate on games with point-to-point or area control games.  Hammer of the Scots, Napoleon, and Crusader Rex are all classics!  Bobby Lee, Sam Grant, and Athens & Sparta are not.  

Crusader Rex is a finely balanced game, with tough decision making, and dramatic conflict.  What more could a wargamer want?!?

Edit (2 years later):  Except more balance.  I find it too easy for the Saracen player to adopt a strategy where a slow crawl virtually guarantees a win.

RATING: 6
One play only, so this is kind of a "placeholder" rating.  1.4 Ruleset, I was Saracen, and despite hearing about how rough it is for the Franks, I lost.  After the game, I could see tactical errors I made along the way but am not sure how I lost, or more accurately, how I could have won.  So far, unimpressed.

RATING: 7
Too difficult for the Franks.  Maybe there is a required strategy to play, but short of the designer telling you how to play both sides, I don't see it. Even if the Franks run away for 2 years to minimize units added to the pool, the odds of winning still seem heavily against them.  The game needs more balance, either for a victory condition, or unit entry.
Update: Played with the new 1.4 rules.  They have many good modifications, and I have played a couple of times.  I still have repeatedly won with the Sarecens but the games have been much closer and much more enjoyable.  Rating bumped up from 4 to 7.

Update: This game was my favorite of the Columbia block games until Richard the III came out. It tends to be a bit longer than some others like Hammer or Liberty but it works well with the new 1.4 rules. I can't what till the WBC's picks this one up.

Update: 1.4 rules changed the way Siege Combat works from 1.3. I don't know why but it favors the Saracen player. I play Crusader using 1.3 Combat rules where Siege is handled round by round upto 3 rounds total.

Updated: play tested some 2.0 rule changes. Promising changes that add balance and new dynamics. So far so good. 

Final update: 2nd edition sucks. It may be more historically accurate but game play is more scripted and less fun. Waiting for crusaders and moving each block per AP, come on Columbia! Seige attrition plus event card rip-offs from J.C. You botched it, admit it!

I couldn't really get into this game.  Why would I play this when Rommel in the Desert is a far superior wargame specimen of the same length (maybe denser rules)?

I cannot express much fondness for the point to point movement or the campaign cards (seem like an attempt at mixing in CDG wargame).  The tactical positioning is one of my favorite parts of most wargames and this game doesn't really have any of it.  

However that is not my main complaint.  Instead, I severely dislike the game dynamics.  Saracens are quite powerful at first which encourages the Franks to bottle up.  The game basically comes down to the Franks trying to hold onto as many VPs as possible until they are strong enough to counterattack and hopefully grab the VPs needed to win before the game is over.

Therefore, in my 5 games (mostly as the Franks), the Frank player sits around burning cards to do nothing.  Then, neither player enjoying themselves too much takes stock of how many VPs the Franks have and their forces and one player concedes,  i.e., I never actually get to do anything interesting.

Overall it just seemed like a pointless exercise in dice rolling since we don't see many alternate strategies and the tactical game is pretty tame.

RATING: 5
Tense block game covering the 3rd Crusades. European knights try desperately to maintain their tenuous hold on the Holy Lands while the Saracens attempt to create a breach in the network of Crusader forts to exploit. Some fiddlyness in the combat, movement, and reinforcement systems makes this game a bit heavy to even experienced wargamers, but reinforces the theme and makes the game richer for the trouble. After a couple plays, (especially with the latest "living rules",) fans of the system and era should be able to knock out games quickly. Of all the block games I've played, it bears a close situational feel to '1812'. Add 1 or 2 points if you're a fan of block games.

Very good.  I like the movement system, the dice system is also very interesting.  The differences between the special abilities of the Crusaders and the special abilities of Saladin's armies make for a fascinating and asymetric battle.  My only concern is that the game seems to feel like a lot of work for not a lot of effect - essentially a player is trying to hold a majority of the key cities at the game end, and this means that the tug-of-war over those cities doesn't sway over much land.

Despite this one mild misgiving, the game is really thoroughly excellent.  I love the Columbia block games, and this, along with Wizard Kings, may be my favourite.

UPDATE: With play balance concerns more or less retired, I've been very happy with Crusader Rex and have enjoyed it a great deal. It's short, it fast-paced, it's highly-playable, it's historically interesting, and there are lots of options for both side. Personally, I like Crusader Rex a lot more than Hammer of the Scots, because it feels more open, where Hammer often felt bottle-necked.
---
Sort of a provisional rating. The system itself is great, and the core cardplay/movement/combat/siege I think works better than Hammer, and the more open playing field also is more interesting.

The concern of course is play balance. The first game we played was a Crusader win, but, of some concern, a total blow-out. These things happen, of course, but with experienced gamers it's unusual unless there is a sense that something went seriously wrong, which was not the case here. So ... the judgement is certainly not conclusive, and I look forward to giving it another try. I'll be paying attention to the balance issues, and if they prove elusive, this'll easily round up to an 8, and really, balance is my only significant worry. Systemically, Crusader Rex is a proven game, and felt very solid.

RATING: 5.5
[14/10/2006] I have to say I firmly belong into the Hammer of the Scots 'camp'. Crusader Rex (v1.4) suffers IMO under the following:

- Less tight resources (moves, block draws, replacement points) compared to Hammer of the Scots.
- Problematic victory conditions: They encourage a gamey endgame and the end-of-the-world syndrome.
- Both of the above factors also ensure that ordinary castles do not get their due in terms of their strategic importance. A shame since had they more of a strategic role, the game would IMO gain a lot more strategic depth. This would also make the trade-off between spreading out or concentrating one's forces a lot more balanced (which it is not presently, particularly in the endgame).

I really like the basic mechanics. CR offers more room for manoeuvre warfare compared to HotS. Battles and sieges are well-implemented. It's the logistical/economic aspects and the victory conditions, which I deem problematic.

Let's just sit here doing absolutely nothing for the most part.  When we do end up doing something, let's be at such a disadvantage that rolling gads and gads of dice won't even help.  It's no wonder the Crusades took hundreds of years.

2판으로 맵이 일신되었다. 제3차 십자군 시대를 배경으로 한 게임이다. 얘길 들어보면 해머오브스캇보다 좀더 룰이 간편해 졌다는데, 한글룰북이 없어서 고민중이다.

RATING: 4
Similar to Hammer of the Scots but played on a very broad front with many options rather than being forced to follow the same repetitive strategy of channelling troops northwards from the border. It still has the 'wintering' problem that means that only 4 out of 6 cards tend to be played trying to expand your territory before you need to start thinking about getting all your forces back home again. The map needs be to bigger. Even a small force obscures the connections. The rules are quite short but didn't answer several questions that cropped up during play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An absolute gem of a game. The theme is captured and you are left with tons of decisions to make on every turn. No two games are alike with the draw pool. You might get the help from the powerful crusading units one game and the next game you might be on your own. The hardest part is deciding whether to play this or Richard the 3rd.

RATING: 6
This was the first "block system game" I have every played.  It was easy to play once I got the concept.  

I got lucky and was able to win the game early before the end of the third year (of six years) playing the Saracens.  Playing the Franks I was able to build an advantage over time before we folded in the fourth year.

RATING: 7.75
Played 1.0 twice. Only 1st turns of each as the game seemed totally against Franks

Then played 1.4 twice but also only 1st turn as Franks conceded 1st game and on 2nd game we thought it looked like it would be turtling all game long.

Would like to try 2.0

Typically spare Columbia offering, with a chess like feel as Crusaders and Saracens contest a thin strip of land, dotted with strongholds. Few pieces, minimal cards, but lots to think about, and just enough chrome to give it an authentic feel

RATING: 8.5
Maybe the best introductory blockwargame. Easy but not repetitive, does a very good job in simply depicting both the historical crusade and the real way of fighting in that times. It also smartly introduces some flavour and chance with the particular franks build-up/arrive.

2nd edition.  Excellent game, very asymetric.  The Franks (Crusaders) spend a few years just hanging on, them the Crusaders arrive and its much more even - but usually by then one of the Victory Cities has fallen to the Saracens and the Franks need to attack.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Despite the fact that the changed rules make it more balance, I miss the tactical options that the original version of the rules had (such as two different scores for Saracen's Horse Archers, and different rules for the Frankish Knights). As a result, my interest in this game has dropped like a stone.

RATING: 8
Playing the Franks is quite challenging.  You've gotta have the fortitude to take it.  I like the pain.  Dice rolls  and more importantly card draws have to go the Franks way in order for them to have a chance.  Its not LUCK...its God's will.  But, you do have to back up the good fortune by making the right tactical decisions.
Playing the Sarecens is fun because you have a lot of advantages and a lot of room to manuever.  Wreckless play will get you in trouble though.

I had some fun with Crusader Rex but it comes from the fact that I'm an huge outremer fan, and the only game on the subject (barring crusades I and II) was Crusades from Berg and S&T memory.
The game will be a success for the fans of the block system out there but I found major problems in the realm of simulating the period and the wristage needed in order to play.

Tremendous.  The virtues of Hammer of the Scots are preserved here and in many ways enhanced, making for a deeply engaging, compelling wargame that is both completely accessible and full of detail and specficity.  The Franks have a tough time of it through the first few years, fighting to keep their strongholds while the Muslims stage a nasty counterattack.  It's a matter of waiting for the Crusaders to show up and strike back.  I think it's slightly better than HOTS (itself an awesome game) mainly because there's more options and it doesn't feel quite so hopeless for the weaker side.  The only complaints are those that are typical for a Columbia game- lo-fi production and the map could stand to be larger.  All in all, one of the best games of the year and one that stands with the best of Columbia Games' fantastic products.

If this game had not been published before it was properly playtested I would have given it a higher rating of a 7 or 8. The designers have listened to the input of their customers and have made changes to fix balancing issues, but this really ought to have been handled before it came to market.That said, I really do enjoy the game. This is a fairly easy wargame that gives you a lot of options to work with, so there is replay value here. It also can be played in a 2-3 hours which is a plus for any wargame. The theme of Third Crusades is also a plus in my book! I look forward to playing this again now with the new rules out.Update - maybe they listen to their customers too much. As of 7/24/06 there is yet another rule update to balance the game, as it is perceived to be uneven against the Franks. Come on Columbia games get with it! I spend my hard earned money to buy a finished product and not to be the testing grounds for what is looking more and more like a product still in the beta stage! Thus my rating is going down again...

Dec. 16, 2009 -- Two plays in, and aside from some errors with the rules on the first play, I have to say I enjoyed the game. The strategy eludes me, and it showed in my shameful losses, but I like the way the game works. The fog of war is a nice touch, and the movement of pieces feels almost chess-like in nature. I think with some more time, I could really get into block games. 7/10

I think these block games just aren't my thing, perhaps. I just don't find much interesting in them. I don't feel like an army general making important decisions. These games (Columbia block) are similar enough to pretty much all feel the same, yet different enough in rules exceptions to make learning them and being comfortable with the rules frustrating. 

I appreciate the themes, but I just don't enjoy the gameplay enough to want to play these. I think there are other 2 player games I will always suggest over these block games.

RATING: 9
No black block for the assassins, but that's nothing that some nail polish didn't rectify. Everyone has black nail polish at home, right? Good. The rules are opaque on the page; setting up the board up for a couple of solo play-throughs and some help from BGGeeks and the designer ironed out most of the wrinkles. Xmas 2007 update: thanks to a newly-acquired working knowledge of HotS, which deals with most of the mechanics, we have now been at liberty to concentrate on the CR-specific rules variations and   we understand them! Score may edge up to 8, but I think I prefer HotS. A solid, enjoyable game however with a great historical theme and satisfying gameplay.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is getting compared a lot to HotS.  It's not the same game.  They share some of the same mechanics however each has it's own unique aspects of strategy and play.  I have both and and there are some elements (Templars) that are cool but time has shifted my preference back to HotS as a more desirable game, though harder to play a good strategy.  Rating 8 -> 7

RATING: 7
Not quite as simple as Hammer of the Scots, this adaption to the 3rd Crusades is well integrated with its theme. Multiple types of units which vary in how/where they appear or die, a good use of different unit ratings and a well designed road network seem to evoke those wars brilliantly.
There does seem to be a bit more randomness though since the crusaders can live or die based on thier block draws as well as combat dice results. The terrific gamble of knights charges add more to the randomness, but fit the theme well.
After a couple of games of this, we are still struggling to get a Crusader win. It seems quite unbalanced but I like the game & theming enough to perservere.

Another great block game. I actually prefer this one to HotS. The Crusades is a more interesting setting at least for me and there is more variation in the game.

Now I just have to learn how to win as the Franks.

Update: The new rules makes this a nice balanced (more than previous at least) and interesting game.

Update: In every game I have played those knight charges have backfired. Not fun!

Update: Sold it.

Players represent the Franks (Crusaders) and Saracens in this block wargame from Columbia.  Features the simultaneous card play from Hammer of the Scots, where the card value represents the number of groups to be moved/mustered.  Combat is typical Columbia, which some siege/storm rules bolted on.  Victory is based on number of cities held, with the Franks holding the majority at the beginning of the game.  So, the Franks have to hold on, while the Saracens must attack.  Interesting game, works well.  The map is a bit of an issue as the blocks basically hide everything important (i.e. castle? VP city? orange city? green city?).

RATING: 7
Play balance aside, this is a great little wargame. Despite having a lot of mechanics in common with Hammer of the Scots, the game situation is wildly different, probably having a more replayability too. Where HotS has chesslike strategy punctuated by bold strategems, Crusader Rex feels like a desparate knife fight in a phone booth, with all the chaos and randomness that entails. I look forward to further playings and rules revisions to see if this may improve with time.

As a block game, Crusader Rex offers that interesting challenge of hidden information as a part of battle/campaign friction. In that sense, it succeeds very well. I don't rate it as highly as Hammer of the Scots because it doesn't feel as balanced (especially if the Islamic forces get early victories) and because it doesn't have that delightful mechanism of nobles switching sides. Hammer gets played more at my house, but Crusader isn't leaving my game shelf.

Has the same simple form of the HotS ruleset. Like HotS, the system is simple but challenging for both sides. Components, i.e., the map, is a bit sucky, especially after seeing the magnificient homemade effort on BGG, but this is a very small issue.

I would have been happier if the game had been tweaked minimally. We're already at Rules v1.4 and I hope it's the last one. I don't think this game was unbalanced right from the start. Playing either the Franks or the Saracens, you just have to take into account their peculiar strategic situation and act accordingly. It should not be a case of playing the Franks, ignoring the reality, playing things your way, and then whining about how imbalanced the game is. Anyone who has played the Saracens would be well aware that their position has certain weaknesses, which can be and should be exploited by a good Frankish player.

Under the original rules I would give this a 6, maybe a 7.  It's no where near as much fun as Hammer of the Scots or even Wizard Kings.  However, I have heard the latest rules greatly improve the game balance, but I haven't had a chance to try them yet.

I think the designer is one of the best at historical simulation and the best person to adapt a scenario to the block "fog of war" mechanics.

This game does not entertain me in the slightest; most likely due to the rules and map movement that are necessary parts of the design.

Having admitted that the failure in the game is mine, I removed myself from the equation.

Initial rating after a single play (using 1.4 rules I presume). I didn't know what to make of the strategy playing the Franks. I went out way too hard and it hurt me (too many sixes on charges). Just reading comments in the ratings made me think of a dozen things I should have done differently. Hopefully I'll get another chance to play again and implement some of that. I also felt that there was little to mitigate poor die rolls, but that is just a personal preference, not a knock on the game.

One of two Columbia block games I don't enjoy. The lack of strong movement options, plus the seemingly unlimited reinforcement's and the game's strong incentive to return home and lick your wounds leads to a complete lack of tension. The addition of siege combat slows things down even more, and taking and holding a fortified space seems like it would take at LEAST a turn.

It might be good history, but it's not a fun game.

It's a period of history I like to read about and paint miniatures for.  It's a unique design and a small wargame that feels like a very broad campaign.  It plays big.  It's a beautiful point to point map that allows swift movement, temptations and traps. It's a map I've studied for hours.  It's card driven and moves are precious.  It has dramatic 'down to the last man' sieges but it's also a game of maneuver.  The Franks have power, the Saracens have speed.  It looks beautiful and offers enough choices to burn your brain. As a bonus, after most turns there's the thrill of rolling dice in combat.  I'm no expert, but so far my games have been close, exciting, and memorable. I'm rating this game a 10.  Jerry Taylor is my favorite designer and needs to make more games like this! A lot of intelligent thought went into this design. 

 Note:  If you play it once and expect it to be like Hammer of the Scots, you need to play it again.  It offers three fronts instead of one and the width of the map combined with the low number of units creates more maneuver.  This game gives the player more options, and that makes it harder to 'get'.

RATING: 5
This was a dissapointment, since I really like Hammer of The Scots. Maybe it has something to do with the openness of the map, I don't know. It also struck me while playing the game that I don't really care for the theme. And the balance issues and all the rule changes really bothered me. I probably should try the latest version of the game to see if it has improved, but there are so many other games out there I'd rather play.

[1 play]  Hmm, the idea was very cool, but it seems like the best game for the saracens was to harry the enemy constantly and then run away.  It was a game of just whittling down your opponent unit by unit.  I could totally see how some people would love this, but I just like more decisive possibilities in my wargames.

I bought the 1st Edition when it first came out and suffered all the way through the official rules edit 1.4.    Then I pre-ordered the 2nd edition with a hard board expecting a perfected game and rulebook (version 2.0).

The version 2.0 rules are a disaster.  They are inexplicably unclear and have spawned a massive user-produced FAQ and widespread confusion.

After years of development this outcome is completely inexcusable.  I sold my copy and will hesitate long and hard before buying another Columbia Product again.

Love the historical period.  Love block games. Spent a lot of time learning the game.  Ultimately disappointed.

Not sure I have the desire to invest more time in this to try them.  Game is still interesting, but ultimately disappointing for me.

RATING: 6
So far in my limited block playing career, this might be my favorite.  I did enjoy Hammer of the Scots, but the teleporting Nobles felt more like a logistics puzzle than anything else.  You have 'Wintering' in Crusader Rex, but it's easier to plan and makes for some tough choices, especially when there is a siege underway!  I like how the different sides play different from each other as well, and it fits very well into the theme of the game.  

My main gripes are...  I appreciate the road movement, but the board needs to be a little bigger to compensate for the blocks, especially if you have any hope of keeping track of who is who.  My other gripe with this and other block games is that you have to accept the role that dice play, and they play a big part.  I am okay with this, but I can see this being more of a sticking point for others.

This game looked like it was going to be awesome, but it turned out to be quite the mess with degenerate strategies, horrible play balance, the designer's initial insistence that these problems did not exist, followed by constantly-evolving (and unsuccessful) attempts to fix the rules. I'm glad to see that there's a revised edition being produced, and maybe they can finally get it right.

Compared to HotS, I like the more detailed combat system (charge, harry, seige, storm).  Crusader Rex seems to have a lower tension level than HotS, possibly due to less event cards, and more distance between the major armies (frequently, it is pretty obvious which card you need to play, unlike HotS).  As the Franks, for many turns you can not attack as you are outnumbered (crusaders must accumulate before entering the game, while Saracen reinforcements nearly always arrive), are lower quality (shoot last on the attack), move slower, more brittle (units take less hits, and more units subject to permanent loss) and the Saracens can Harry and run away if outnumbered; this leads to being at the mercy of a poor card draw or 1 bad battle.  An interesting situation, but bound to result in a bad experience on occasion.  Finally, I think this game is about the same complexity as HotS, but the rulebook is shorter, leading to more ambiguity about a few game functions (more words about a few subjects would have been nice).  Kind of critical I guess, but being the younger sibling of HotS is tough!  The map and block artwork is very nice.

Update after a few more plays:  I won't judge balance yet, but I can say that it isn't much fun to play the Franks (lots of sitting around).  Given that at least the first third of the game gives the Franks little to do, combined with all of the rules changes, I just don't see putting more time into this game.

Columbia block game that has improved with additional play. I don't find the history terribly interesting, but the gameplay is tense. Manoeuvre is very important, as is supply. Battles are usually kept to a minimum, but are often very exciting. The two sides play differently, which is a plus for repeated play.

-Components: requires a hard board 
-Balance, the 'hit-and-run' Saracen attacks are too powerful imo.
-I don't particularly like road movement maps. I prefer hexes or areas.

This one has more freedom as far as options are concerned compared to Hammer, it has a strong theme, tense and fun gameplay. 

Production is good -would have loved a mounted board!!- and I just love the big blocks. To play the Franks is more difficult but when you live your role as defender of the holy land well makes it reallyfun. The balance favors the Saracens a bit more and the 'hit & run' tactic will make the difference. This is my only worry as far as balance is concerned.   

The last years I started to appreciate block games more and more and despite they take away the feel of being a Commander in Head Quarters, bending over a map to plan, the block system is one of the best innovations in wargaming to provide fun to a game. Easier to handle than counters, durability and adds fun with steps and fog. 

Have not played it for a long time,  I got a good offer and decided to sell it.

Sold it.

Love the theme, but each individual battle is too long, with too many dice.  The game, for what it is (mostly tactical and luck based) drags on too long.  As for the components, the blocks are good, the unmounted map is way too small and the game would need some kind of side board to show which units are behind remparts and which are not; way too expensive for what it is.As for the rules, they keep on changing; publishing an errata or a corrected version of the rules is ok, changing rules every two monthes shows poor development/playtesting. 
A pity, the box image and the comments I read made me expect something much more fun.I'll try again in a year or two, with the final rules.

RATING: 8
Two plays in (still learning the game)

Good game on the Third Crusade.  It is fairly quick to play (3-4 hours) and the mechanics work well, IMHO.  Every turn there are some though decisions to be made, from deciding to consolidate, muster, launch an attack, reinforce a City or try to lift a siege.

The combat system is similar to the one found in WIZARD KINGS and to some extent VICTORY!, but one has more options such as 'Charge' for Crusader units, 'Harry' for Saracens and Turcopoles.  Not to mention 'Storm Castle' and 'Sally' to meet the besieging forces on the field.

The beauty of the system is the limited resources you have, represented by the cards.  Therefore you need to have a general idea of what you'd like to do during each of the 6 game years, while retaining some flexibility in order to counter your opponents moves.

If you're interested in this period, I recommend you read THOMAS F. MADDEN's review here on BGG, as well as his book, [b][i]The New Concise History of the Crusades[/i][/b], which gives a good overview of the period.  [u]ISBN[/u]: 0-7425-3822-2 (hardcover)

I've only played a single game with version 1.3 rules but it looked like the Franks have it pretty rough.  I was able to take a Saracen victory without much trouble.  I think it's just too hard to bring in Frank reinforcements to make the game close and tense.  A few rules tweaks and this game could be much, much better.  Maybe I dislike the straightfowardness of CR without all the nifty mechanics in HotS like winter resets and nobles (things I initially despised).  I guess I'll wait and see what they do with the rules before I write the game off.

My God, how ambiguous the rules of this game are! What a painfull amount of details, that so easily slip from your mind, when the heat of battle rises.

I still really like it. The ugly map and really obnoxious cards (plus the blocks - which are, sort of neutral) hide a game that can make you stay on the edge of your seat for two hours.

Still, I need to figure a lot of things out (16 pages of FAQ and counting!)

Crusader Rex is even better than its predecessor Hammer of the Scots. It retains many elements of the earlier Jerry Taylor game but small changes to the rules as well as a different map and force pool impart a noticeably different feel. Furthermore, the luck of the cards and the draw pool has less of an impact than in HoTS and player strategies are less constrained. Playing Crusader Rex again after a break of several months, having played a number of more complex wargames in the meantime, I am struck by how a block wargame with only 8 pages of rules can be so tactically rich and provide such a convincing narrative. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very good game.  However, the addition of sieges is not as interesting of a mechanic as the nobles awitching sides in Hammer of the Scots.  While not quite as good as Hammer this was still a fun time.  The components are great except the map which lacks functionality as the blocks are far too big for the city spaces (blocks had to constantly be shuffled around to see what was under them and to see exactly which space they were on).  Additionally, there was no good way to mark when a force was under siege.

Jerry does it again.  I've got a bunch of plays under my belt now, and I just LOVE HotS so it's no real surprise that I dig this game.  The point 2 point map is gorgeous.  The seige rules are bit more dense than HotS, but I still dug it.  After playing a few games with the latest 1.3 rules for CRex I've bumped my rating for this game up to a 9.  IT WORKS.  The Franks have more oppurtunity to hang on now.  The Saracens cannot attack with impunity as they can lose Emirs.  This is a great game.

RATING: 3
Update: I have now played this with the 1.4 rules, and while a bit easier on the Franks, they unfortunately do nothing to fix the game's balance issues. In short, if the Saracens play aggresively without being reckless, I can't see how the Franks stand a chance at all. None of my games have seen the crusaders arrive before all was lost.

In fact, while I really want to like the game, I feel it is so unbalanced, I just can't be bothered to play it again with so many other wargames waiting to be played.
----------

Columbia block game covering the 3rd Crusade. First impression: Fun, but how are the Franks supposed to have a chance?? Hopefully, further play will show that the game doesn't suffer from any balance problems, despite my initial results. Update: Appearently I wasn't the only one who felt this way. New, revised rules have been published and it seems they may change balance quite a bit, hopefully making the game a balanced contest.

RATING: 6.5
Two part-plays only (called it early both times). 

Borrows a lot from Hammer of the Scots, one of my favourite games, but the Crusader situation seems less fluid in that the best Frankish strategy seems to be pulling in isolated units quickly and turtling up in two or three fortresses (i.e. pull out of Antioch which lacking a port looks like a death trap) until the crusaders arrive then go on the offensive. Other strategies may become apparent with further plays.

RATING: 4
I am dissapointed.  There is a lot to like about Crusader Rex.  The Franks and Saracens feel very different and playing one side is completely different from playing the other.  The map is excellent, its point-to-point movement system works very well.  I also like the smaller number of event cards.

The downside is that the game itself seems very poorly balanced.  I know that it can take a while for players to figure out strategies, but right now it seems as though the Franks have almost no chance of winning against competent Saracen play.  At all.  As the Frankish position gets worse, their chances for getting the Crusaders to join play get worse also.  This leads to runaway victories.  I'm also not wild about how easy it seems for castles to be stormed.  I may give Crusader another shot, but I'm not going to rush to do so.

UPDATE:  I was pleased to see Jerry Taylor take the opportunity to fix some of the problems with CR, in particular weakening the deadly "Saracen Creep" strategy that seemed so difficult to beat.  Now there are concerns about CR being inbalanced the other way.  "Frank"ly (ha ha) these issues should have been worked out long before the game was even released.

The post release (1.4) rules make for a very different game than the original release.  The Franks can concentrate much tighter and hit a lot harder than they originally could.  In contrast to Hammer of the Scots, Crusader Rex is a game about larger armies and bigger battles - there is a real "gut check" factor for players when they commit to a major engagement.

Worth revisiting if you tried the original (1.0) rules and gave the game up as hopelessly favoring the Saracens. (which it did)

Credited as a playtester in the revised rules so no rating.

I really disliked my session of this game. Crusaders are very static and most of time do nothing, until they get some reinforcements. Game mechanics are strange as well. In modern block games if you do not wish to move you can usually use points to other types of actions, here it does not. Also I think card-driven game without dual-purpose cards does not work in these days. It could be at least intro-wargame but for that it tooks too long. So although I do not like it either for example Richard is much better for this purpose.

Otherwise it cannot be compared to more refined games like Hellenes, Prussia Defiant Stand, etc.

Based on 2 plays.  The game continues in the vein of HotS with new Middle Eastern features.  Most of the changes to that system are interesting but ultimately not as well executed as I would like.  The siege rules in particular are clunky.  Still, the geography of the game is more open that HotS and so the movement of armies appears to be a bit more dynamic than in its predecessor.  The rating will probably change if I get to play it again, though for better or worse I do not know.

We are, with my wife, rather typical euro-gamers. I used to play a little bit of hex-and-counter war games, but this was some 15-20 years ago. We bought the Crusader Rex after giving it a long thought. At first we decided not to buy it, but it caught our attention again after one year, and eventually we decided to go for it.

The rules are little bit chaotic, but after the first game most of the issues cleared out. I checked the official FAQ, apart from one thing I believe we figured out all the problems correctly with the instruction alone.

This is an incredibly exciting game. Although it may seem a little bit like a dice fest, eventually it is the dices that give it a lot of excitement. It is not as random as it seems after all. One just needs to calculate the luck factor into his strategic plan: take advantage of the fortunate rolls, and keep a reserves for the unlucky ones.

If you are interested in this historical period you should definitely at play this game. It is surprisingly well following the real event. Initially the Saracens have great advantage and should be able to gain territory. However, as the third crusade gathers, the balance changes, and the end of the game may be a real struggle for the Saracen to keep the majority of the cities.

If you have no experience in the war games, it should not be a problem, if you are not scared of heavier games (for comparison: rules are, in my opinion as complicated as Caylus). For my wife this is the first wargame she ever played, and she enjoys it a lot.

My rating is low because, if I have an opportunity to play this, I would rather play Hammer of the Scots instead.

I definitely like HotS better, because the nobles-switching-sides business is so cool, and because it's a lot more possible to hose the other player just by making good moves.

Also, although the towns-connected-by-roads of the CR map [i]look[/i] better than the bordered areas on the HotS map, I think the HotS map works better; in CR you have to keep picking up the blocks to see the castle limits, which is a little irritating.

Well. It could be great but I am not so sure. 

Let me start by saying that I like the game, and think it could he a lot of fun, but the rules are a mess. Even after posting here and on consim, we run into question that are simply not covered int he rule book. Also there is the balance issue. I don't find it too bad in 1.3, a slight advantage for the saracen player. 

The changes in 1.4 look like the may balance the game a bit more. (Maybe too much?) 

I also have to express my disappointment in Columbia for releasing a game this unfinished. There are problems with balance, rules and mistakes on the map. The block games are not cheap! i would expect a playable product out of the box. 

I admire their commitment to getting it right with the rules tweaks, however they should hit closer to the mark from the start. 

Update: I am happy with the 1.4 rules.

Another classic Columbia block game.  

The siege portion of the battle rules required a bit of studying prior to playing but flowed smoothly during the actual game.  

After three plays finding it difficult to capture victory cities as either side but love the theme and enjoy the game.

Update: Just completed a fourth game.  Upped the castle storm limit to Castle Limit +1.  This, coupled with more effective use of siege attrition and harrying resulted in an enjoyable game with the Franks hanging on for dear life to hold Tripoli on the last turn and win the game.

My first block game - lots of fun! I think I'll be expanding my block game collection. Had heard that earlier versions suffered from imbalance, but with the 1.4 version of the rules I think the game is pretty well balanced.

As with Hammer of the Scots, I love these type block games. I love the suprise of not knowing what your getting in to, not to mention that the sieging/storming rules are a really nice addition. It also cleans up the winter round quite a bit to make it easier and more streamlined.

I am not a wargamer, however I like this game. It doesn't take that long to play (less than 3 hours for my first play) and the rules are about as complex as Power Grid.
Lot's of clever mechanics (fog of war, "winter" , timed reinforcements). 
I don't know if they are common because the only other "wargames" I played are Memoir 44, Risk, Axis and Allies and things like War and History of the world. 
However, they give a good "simulation" feeling to me.

Crusader Rex is an interesting follow-up game to Hammer of the Scots. I like th topic, because it is not the 100th game of "Wacht am Rhein"...
Despite the great components and the excellent rulebook I have problems with Playbalance. At the moment I have no idea how to win with the Franks. They will be crushed in every game so far (o.k., I have played it only 6 times...). I am not sure, but I thinks the rules had to be tipped a little bit in favor of the Franks.

I've not been a war gamer, but the reviews and comments on this one made me give it a try. The historical period also appeals to me. While a game of even this length won't get on the table often, it appears to be an elegent simulation of historical events. And a war game with less than 10 pages of rules is one I can certainly work with.

The latest version of the rules takes care of the balance issues and clarifies some of the sections that generated a lot of questions.  This is still an unusual campaign with a lot of options for both players.  The game is easy to set up, plays fast, and most of our games go down to the last turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Similar enough to Hammer of the Scots that it's easy to learn but different enough to be its own game rather than a copy.

It looks to be a solid and challenging game in the Columbia line and Hammer heritage, but I'll need to play it again to know for sure. Barring the discovery of some weird flaw or broken system, I'm pretty sure 7 is the right ballpark for a ranking.

RATING: 7.75
More involved game than Hammer, but not too bad.  I like the siege rules.  Knights charge also adds some decisions, as well as the navel moves.  Lots of tense situations.  The road movement set up perfectly to add strategic decisions.  Good back and forth, reasonable playtime.  I think this is an even better game than Hammer, although with added playtime and difficulty.

RATING: 6
I quite enjoyed my experience, despite the fact that playing as the Franks I got thoroughly trashed. (Played with v1.0 of the rules). There is definitely enough good ideas thrown in there to make me want to download and play with v1.4 or apply my own in-house fixes. The theme is great, not one that I have seen in many games so far.

RATING: 5
Interesting block wargame with the flavour of a card-driven mechanic.  Two sides (and how they play to meet the win conditions) are different enough to  allow good replayability and the option to try new strategies.  Time spent playing feels just right.

Sweet block game, not as complicated as Rommel. Seems to be quite combat oriented with a little scope for out-manoevering your opponent. A challenge for the Franks, you need to hang on, hope the dice are in your favour, and that the reinforcements are on the way. You might have lost by then though!

***UPDATE 2***

Just finished a long slog through CRex 2nd Edition. I don't know that the game has improved any. Saracens still seem to have all the advantages, Crusaders arrive just in time to lose, and the new events are questionable. Add in the 14-page FAQ. Rating lowered. 

***UPDATE***
New 1.3 rules balance the game very well, though there are irksome rules that remain (the awful Frank Knight's Charges).  Need more plays with all the new rules; score may rise again.  Hugely fun game that has made the excellent HotS fade a bit into the background.


So I've played (badly) twice as the Franks, and they can be a VERY frustrating and unforgiving power to play.  There was a time during both games when I was seriously ready to chuck the dice out the window and call it a game.  But no matter how hard I fall, I usually end up admiring Taylor's design and the mechanics of play.  Some things do need to be tweaked, and when they are this rating will rise.

Another excellent game using the Hammer of the Scotts system. Sieges and assassins oh my!

RATING: 3
I realise that my rating of the game is out of line with that of others here, so perhaps I should explain that I have, as always, used the BGG ratings guide as the basis for my rating.  Also that I have only played the game a few times and my rating may change depending on future playings and/or official rules changes.

My problems with the game are in two categories.  First, it appears to be wildly unbalanced in favour of the Saracens.  At least in part this seems to be the result of major, untested changes to the combat rules a few days before publication.  Secondly, the game seems to me to bear little resemblance to the history of the period - something which I see as a problem in a wargame.

Nice components and in general I am a huge fan of Columbia's games.  I wanted to like this game but I haven't so far been able to do so.

Since no sensible fixes for this game have so far emerged, and its problems have become even more evident than when I first posted, I have reduced my original '4' rating to a '3'.

RATING: 8
To me, this is the definite implementation of medieval warfare (on a strategical scale) as a boardgame. I like Crusader Rex even better than Hammer of the Scots, as the board has fewer bottlenecks and you have more options in combat.

Update: Rating lowered to 8. I wish somebody would clarify the rules for sieges - everybody seems to interpret them differently. Also, I believe the Saracens have it too easy. Maybe play an additional year if the Franks control 3 cities at the end?

I like block games, as they are essentially games of maneuver where the key decisions are when and where to accept battle with how much forces for how long. This fits perfectly with the hidden information inherent in the block mechanic and the only detriment for my personally is, that I am not a big fan of hidden information games generally. Plus the block mechanic can begin to feel generic as it gets applied to more and more battles and campaigns. But it all works fine in this game hence the rating.

I thought that this game was going to be in the same category as Hammer of the Scots, but it fell far short of the mark.

Options are much more limited in Crusader Rex, and from moment one the Crusaders are forced to hide in their castles in the face of overwhelmingly superior Saracen forces. It kills any drama and doesn't make much of a game for the Crusader player (win or lose). To make matters worse, the Saracens spread like a mold and simply run away when attacked (inflicting casualties on the Franks while doing so) and suffer no penalty. Extremely boring and frustrating for the Frank player.

Dull and static and a waste of my 4 hours (2 games). I'm reluctant to even give this one another play.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Crusader Rex is a light wargame I like a lot. It has some historical feel to it and it plays a bit differently than other Columbia block game I have (EastFront II and Rommel in the Desert). Point to point movement, for example, is rather interesting in this game and it really forces players to think and make hard decisions. Waiting for crusaders is a neat idea as it creates a lot of tension and excitement. When playing you have to throw buckets of dice. But even though luck every now and then dictates the winner of a battle it does not dictate the winner of the whole war. 

[I'm confused: there are now two different versions of the game on the market and there are, I guess, six versions of the rulebook. I have no idea which edition is the best and whether I should upgrade my kit, and if so, how. Moreover, I have no idea whether other wargamers are playing and discussing the same Crusader Rex that I'm playing and want to talk about. This is really really annoying!]
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.95
Upgraded rating due to the latest rules.  The new rules allow for more flexibility on the part of the Franks, and give them a fighting chance of defending Jerusalem during the opening two years.  

I've still never seen a game in which the Franks win, but hope to see one soon.  To be fair, I've played as the Saracens each time, so maybe I should be proud?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Brilliant, yet simple wargame. Asymmetrical forces, set-up and simple rules, such as the harry and knights charge tactics, give the two sides simple yet effective differences in play. Slightly let down by a couple of ambiguous rules. (8.5)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This edition of Crusader Rex has honed an already good game into an excellent one.  I own most of the Columbia games range and this comes to the table more than any other.  It has the perfect mix of tough decisions and fun.  Is much deeper that Columbia's latest offering Julius Caesar and as a result is infinitely more rewarding.  For those who have the original?  The second edition is still worth the money.  Better Maps, unit tweaks, card changes and streamlined rules. The second edition is head and shoulders above the original and most important of all the play balance is now spot on.
Enjoy :-)

A straightforward, easy-to-learn 2-player block-based wargame set in the 3rd Crusade.

Not sure that I am ever going to like the combat system in these block games, it seems to favor the defender way too much, however I love the fog of war aspect that the blocks themselves provide.

Traded it away.

Relatively easy to learn Columbia block game, though I must note I own several, so I know the system fairly well. After about 6 plays I felt like I had all the basics down, particularly after rewriting the rules down to two pages. 

This doesn't grab me as much as some of the other Columbia blocks games, but that's mainly because medieval warfare doesn't interest me as much as ancient or 20th century. That said, I could raise my rating with additional experience. 

Bought used in December, 2009. Waited a long, long time to find a decent price for this.

Very serious balance problems, but Jerry's recommended "modifications" help. You must get the version 1.3 rules for this game to have any chance at being balanced ... see ... http://www.columbiagames.com/resources/3226/3226-crusaderrules.pdf

A typical Columbia Games sloppy production with little to no playtesting.

Interesting game.  Seems to offer many good depth and strategic options in a pretty small package (8 pages of rules).  But along with this 'good' comes the 'bad'.  What seems to be the best strategic option for the Crusaders seems to be the abandonment of most of the Holy Land while settling back into a few key port / victory cities while awating the large hosts of Crusaders to arrive from England, France, and Germany.  While I don't need wargames to have pure historical tracks to follow, being able to do this in a game modeling the Crusades seems to sell this game short to me.

I was excited to play this one. Read the rules and everything seemed clear. But when we sat down to play, everything fell apart. The rules didn't cover MANY situations, things had to be inferred because they were never covered in the rules, and even after applying all the updates/corrections/changes we found online the game STILL appeared to be heavily weighted toward the Saracens. This will likely not see play at my table again.  (I'm glad we borrowed it from a friend instead of putting down $ on it!!!)

A two-player wargame. I have something against Columbia Games's tilegames. Probably the fact that units are only visible to enemy while fighting. Well, ok, somehow it's thematic, but I find it only annoying...
Quite a lot rolling of dice in this heavy game, even though the combat initiative system (A, B, C) is well done!
I like the theme and therefore I am also willing to play again if I have opportunity. The game of course has its tactical aspects.

Winter is coming!

A superb game in the Hammer of the Scots style.  Eight simple pages of rules that still include chrome (seiges, Knight's Charge, Harrying, etc).  The Saracens descend upon the Franks with a furor post Hattin, but over time the Franks gain strength.  Tense, fun play!

A great theme, and a beautiful game. More complicated than Hammer of the Scots, with exceptions to most of the rules. But I like the more complex battles, with storming castles, and sallying forth with knights charges. (cause rolling tons of dice is just fun!) The map is a little crowded, but by rules version 1.4 the game seems to have good balance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Two games as Franks; got smoked. Need to assess stengths and weaknesses. Saracen 'A' units and the Harrying ability to retreat after a quick shot makes it very hard on the Crusader unless using a massive pursuing force (which will not be available until late in the game, if the Franks can survive that long). Crusader charges seem to be a worthwhile tactic when the Saracens do attack. Crusader strategy may be just to hold in VP cities for as long as possible 1st & 2nd yrs and, when one or more is lost, rebuild in the 3rd & 4th yrs and reconquer in the 5th & 6th. Need to re-read rules because there are a number of nuances that need to be clarified. However, (and this dropped the rating severly for me) the Winter Campaign card is an outright game winner for a prepaered Saracen player. Have downloaded and played vers. 1.4.

Excellent two-player wargame that depicts the military action of the Third Crusade. The game is tense, specially for the Franks (Crusaders) that seem maybe a little bit overwhelmed by their opponents - the Sarracens, eager to free the Holy Land from the infidels through the use of their harrying units, that rarely seem to give a chance for the enemy knights to charge through the battlefield. It is unfortunate, however, the lack of scenario options like those available in Hammer of Scots. Anyway, another score for block wargames.

I dunno.  I've played it a couple of times, but not with v1.4 of the rules which make quite substantial changes.  In v1.3 you could swap cities (say Jerusalem and Egypt) with little nett effect which gave the game a slightly amorphous feel.  Definitely not up there with Rommel in the Desert, but whether it's a keeper remains to be seen.  It is a favourite theme of mine, but I am not rapt yet; an Arsouf-type battle seems hard to set up. Have played with v1.4 rules: the good news is that it is more balanced. The bad is that a lot of the drama around winter is disipated. I want to like it...

Takes the strategic and interractive system of Hammer of the Scots and ports it to a setting with wider scope.

This is another block game by Columbia Games and builds on the model of Hammer of the Scots and Julius Caesar. There are some rule changes and concepts in this game that are different from the other too and I think overall add to the feel and setting of the game. 

Advantages: The combat system is great. the fog of war achieved by the blocks still works well in this game and the strength of the unit is determined by rotating the block. The card play is fast and the arrival of the crusaders in randomized waves makes for unique play experiences.  Some new things like Norman Charge have been added as well as more permanently eliminated units makes for more strategy in the game. Also a section on sieges has been added. Very short rules book and quick to learn. 

Disadvantages: the size of the cards do not fit into standard card sleeve sizes and the price is high for some stickers and blocks of wood. 

rating is lowered by cost over game play.

Don't particularly like block games. That said, I'm very fond of the era and like how the, albeit abstracted, rules portray and underline history and portray the strategies of the time.

Lowered my rating after playing it (once). At first, you seemed to have more to do than time to do it, in a good way. Soon, the minimalistic rules started to feel boring, and as the real killer (lack of reinforcement) started chipping away at the Franks, entertainment ebbed.

Still, a nice game, in its way. Represents history well with what rules it actually has.

Taylor does it again.  Somehow he's taken all the tension and elegance of [i]Hammer of the Scots[/i] and fashioned it into a whole new game.  Sure, there might be some balance questions but they'll have those fixed in a jiffy.  I still had a good time.

RATING: 7
I should like this game more than I should but there is something that I just can't put my finger on.  I think a lot lays with the balance issues that it has.  Version one had some big problems and these were addressed but it seems that it has only created other problems, being that it is hard for the Saracen to now win and often the game will either fizzle out or turn radical as the Saracens gambles everything away.  True the Saracens can have some early luck in taking some cities, but if they are not lucky the game will be over by the second year really, and if they are lucky, the strength of the fank reinforcements will wear them down.

RATING: 8
I really like the setting and the historical accuracy as there are not too many medieval strategy games. With the 1.4 rules Crusader Rex is a solid experience. In the beginning the Saracens have the advantage, but this changes later on. The map could have been slightly larger and of thicker cardboard, but it really isn't that big of a deal.

[BGCOLOR=#FF3300][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Wargame.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Awesome game. I had played Hammer of the Scots previously and this compares very favorably for me; in fact, I think I prefer it. If HotS is a delicious steak, then Crusader Rex is the same steak but with baked potato, asparagus and a nice glass of Bordeaux. Haha, I crack me up. Anyway, seriously, they are similar in basic mechanics but feel quite different in play. CR is definitely a fiddlier game and I plan to find/make a good player aid for it, but I really enjoyed it.

RATING: 6
Perhaps in another life (or if I were retired), CR would have gotten more love. We just don't have the time to play it, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that we aren't willing to make the time. The rules are *just* complex enough that they cannot be easily memorized by infrequent plays, which means we'd have to relearn the game every time we want to play. I must say though, that I like the "feel" of the game. The background information is excellent. I traded this away, but I would have kept it if the rules had been just a little more streamlined. Later rule changes mixed things up even further, and it became hard to recall which rules were correct.

For the price of the game, I expected better quality cards and a better board (both art-wise and thickness-wise). The blocks/stickers were lovely, however. I find that I'm now getting into longer games, so perhaps I'll acquire another "block" war game sometime soon.

RATING: 9.575
Great game!  The only other Crusades game I can think of is "Onward, Christian Soldiers," although I bet the rules are five or ten times longer.  In my opinion, the thing that probably makes it better than "Hammer of the Scots" is that it seems that the game is always close near the end.  The Franks have to be very defensive in the beginning while the Saracens have to be very aggressive.  The Franks must protect one additional city at the start of the game with essentially weaker forces.  In my first game, I thought I was going to win the battles I lost and lose the battles I won.  I remember in that game my Saracens attacked Jerusalem with double the force and half my force was gone before I even got to roll the dice!  I like the fact that Tripoli and the non-objective city of Tyre both have a special peninsula defensive property.  The Saracens also generally have a better movement rate and typically attack earlier in the combat round.  It seems that the game is often determined by when the Franks decide to use their knight's charge ability.  I've found that the knight's charge can be rather ineffective with anything other than the B3s and Richard the Lionhearted who is a B4.

Cool game.  The components are visually appealing.  The heft of the cards and board leaves a little to be desired.  The first gameplay impressions were good, and have only improved over time.

That's the nature of any wargame where one side is weaker but has reinforcements on the way.

While Hammer of the Scots has a higher rating on bgg, this is the better of Jerry Taylor's two designs in my opinion. Like Columbia's other recent designs, it has just enough chrome for historical 'feel' without bogging the players down in details.  If you're looking for a close, detailed historical simulation of the Crusades, look elsewhere, but if you want an elegant game of the Third Crusade, this is it.  With the latest version of the rules, the balance issues have certainly been resolved (although, with the new rules for building replacement steps, perhaps ever so slightly too far in favour of the Franks). While sudden death victories are possible in theory, most times I've played (with the most recent version of the rules) it has been a nail-biter right to the end.

RATING: 8
For anyone who likes the period this is a gem. For anyone who likes the period AND enjoys the Columbia Block systems, this is a double win and an easy must-have.

The typical 8 pages of rules (for Columbia block games) are more than enough to give plenty of flavor, detail, and richness to the game. There's something magical for me where the game gives me all the drama of watching Kingdom of Heaven, but with a better adherence to historical and strategic realities. 

This game is built atop the Hammer of the Scots model, but is very much its own game. It's point-to-point, rather than area-based movement, so it bares more in common with Julius Caesar. It uses cards for movement points and play order, like those others, but the muster movement (convergent, rather than divergent movement, activating all units within range of the target destination) is a new twist I haven't seen in any of the others.

Impressed so far, although I haven't finished reading rules. I see this often mentioned along with JC and HoTS as the best Columbia Block Game, and/or best beginner block game. I can see why. Reputation is deserved.

I don't think block games are for me.  Here, I like rolling dice but this is a bit much and seems a bit repetitive for a 3 or4 hour game.  The combat resolution seems a bit long, and seems to be where more of the fun is supposed to come from than other wargames.  

Not a bad game, there's a fair bit of strategy in regards to what units to use and lose, and what cities to go after and which to defend, and which to fight and when to go inside the castle.

RATING: 8
very tense game; rules are a bit fiddly and shady in a couple of areas so you'll have to improvise as you go and hope for the best in a first game, but after that it should get better as you sort it all out;  the game had a good feel to it as you really felt up against a wall as the Crusader side while waiting for reinforcements to show up, meanwhile the Saracens are constantly popping up and mounting attacks;  sieges were kind of cool and you have to get used to that aspect of the game to master it and get the most out of your troops;  alot of times I had to painfully decide whether to battle the enemy or retreat into the castle to weather out a siege when attacked;  good fog of war stuff created with the block wargame mechanics;  good stuff overall--looking forward to playing it some more

Fooled myself twice by not looking carefully enough at the board, damn.
I don't understand why a siege can't last through the winter (which can't be that severe), and the rule to have your blocks in the castles at the end of the winter-turn is something to take into account. Of course I tend to forget that.
I thought I really wanted to have this, but now I'm in doubt.

I can't praise this game enough. 9 plays (Second Edition. Great replayability. No game has been similar to the others. Light on the rules, heavy on tough decisions and strategy. From my experience 3-5 hours depending on if either player is AP-prone. However, as play time is prolonged due to agonizing decisions, I view this as a positive aspect of the game.

5/4 Franks/Saracens, I can't complain about game balance. A personal goal of mine is to conduct a succesful campaign to sieze Damascus, as the Latins.

Negative: I had big trouble with the stickers, nearly ripped every sticker I tried to remove from the sticker sheet. Have not experienced this problem with any other CG-game so perhaps I just got the odd bad set.

What a great, great game. Always willing to play. Have both editions. Only played second ED. AND this game raised such an interest in the period that I've read 10 books on the topic.

This is the first block game I ever played. But it was really nice, although I did horrible... Also the dice was loaded for the sacracens... I rolled 4,5,6 as the Franks almost all the time. Horrible dice results. But I think I will play more blockgames now.  So good in that way.

The second time I played the sarcaceens and rolled a bit better, (but still badly) and of course I lost again

I love the theme and like the system; however, there are some flaws with this game as released: the rules, especially the siege rules leave many gaps and cause confusion. And the map. The map is much too small for the amount of units which often cover the roads and neighboring towns making it difficult to see the map properly. The map should have probably been double in size (at least the scale) - and could have incorporated the norther portion (Antioch and environs) in an "offboard" area to make the scale better fit the size of map Columbia wants to print.

It is a fun game and I look forward to continuing plays.

Removing my rating of "3" for the original and 1.3 version rules because version 1.4 is out, and I have since traded my copy of CR away.  The original rules were excellent in terms of clarity, but introduced issues that were not caught in playtesting, notably the "Saracen Creep," which broke the game.  

Game gets excellent support from Jerry Taylor, so I expect that this game will eventually be great.

Not as unbalanced as some seem to think. Even with late arrival of the Crusaders, lots of damage can be done. Tripoli, Acre, Jerusalem are all easy, so all you need is one of the tougher ones. Saracens harry ability makes them tough to kill. Those Turcapoles with their A ratings are important to inflict damage on them before they can run away. Can't wait to play more.

Crusader Rex isn't as clever as Hammer of the Scots, but it's an engrossing and entertaining game in its own right.  And come on: the siege combat rules could have used an additional 10 pages of exposition to cover the possible permutations of combined field + siege battles, siege battles only, combat in areas with already-existing sieges, etc. - with and without reserve forces.

The siege warfare is pretty cool, though, once you master its intricacies and shadowed corners.  I like it!

[i]Version 2.0 update:[/i]

The newly remodeled Crusader Rex is first and foremost a game about winter supply and siege attrition, with other interesting stuff thrown in for good measure.

Orchestrating a successful storm is now extremely challenging - to the point where storm-resistant Tripoli has little chance of falling without the attacker having access to certain event cards or the defender leaving its castle undermanned.

The key to the new version's general acceptance is whether the game is now truly balanced (no idea), whether the new cards match the current ruleset, whether players can accept a 2d6 initiative tie-breaker, and also whether the game has swung too far towards being an honest-to-goodness simulation rather than a fun and frantic traipse through ancient religious warfare.

[i]Version 2.0 - second update:[/i]

As much as I would have loved for Crusader Rex v2.0 to be a perfect revision, it isn't.  The ongoing balance issues (in favor of the Saracens) still haven't been resolved, even though that was one of the stated purposes of the second edition.

The following v1.4 rules should be reinstated to help rebalance the game: (1) all emirs (not just some) are permanently eliminated from the game when killed, and (2) Crusader groups are brought onto the board with a single group move, not one move per block.  We may also have to return to the policy where the Crusader player chooses the first player on initiative ties.

And while it's true that the new siege rules are more historically accurate, they are also less fun.  In my book, hoping to get lucky on siege attrition rolls turn after turn doesn't generate much excitement.

Something also needs to be done about the winning player being able to grossly overstack VP cities in the final year to convert them into invincible fortresses.  This has always been a critical problem in Crusader Rex, and the issue still desperately needs to be addressed.

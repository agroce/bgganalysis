Tron light cycles the game - so cool.  The 80's packaging and custom soundtrack (think Axel F) really put this one over the top!

It got 1.5 only because of Coup.

The game is mundane, boring and rather random; the movement system is retarded (loosely based on x-wing system).
And it lasts for more than 5 minutes...

On first sight the insert looks quite useful, but actually it is quite useless - as you put the 'tapes' vertically on the shelf, everything gets messed up.

The only good thing is how the game looks, though even that is iffy.

Great beer and pretzels game which has an awesome Tron vibe.  Extra cool for the designer telling people to play the game to have fun and stop overcomplicating rules that really aren't complicated.

Beer and Pretzel game with rules that are sometimes a little bit vague.

It brings the X-Wing movement system to a bigger group. Components are good, artwork pretty cool, but that's it.

Okay game that comes in an awesome 80s-inspired packaging. Players try to align their straight and curved lasers to collect tokens randomly flipped on the playing surface. A fairly light game with a bit of randomness for fans of the theme. Will play if asked but not a game I will request.

RATING: 7
Really fun game!  It is very simple in its mechanisms, as you zip around the board competing for prizms. Where the game really shines is the stealing of prizms and the tactics required to do that, and to prevent that from happening.  Then you throw the turn die into the mix and hilarity ensues.  You don't turn when you want to, or you spin out, and then you need to completely rethink your path. Lots of strategy here, for the type of game that it is.  Great presentation too!

Full of style! Love the art and the VHS style box. The output randomness of rolling to see if you can successfully turn feels bad though. This can be mitigated a lot by slowing down, but inching your Ryderz along just so you can make turns is also not very fun! One player failed a bunch of dice rolls (even after a spinout which lowers your speed to 1) and just went straight for about 5-6 turns in a row. 

It does feel like you can house rule this into a more fun game with the same components. Maybe create a set of result cards so that the dice roll isn't just a binary success/fail, but provides different results based on how much higher than the target speed was rolled on the die. For instance, a difference of 1 means you can only do soft, not hard turns. A difference of 2-3 means your speed is randomly adjusted 1 speed up or down and then you can only use movement based on your new speed. A difference of 4+ means your closest opponent picks which movement tile of your speed you need to use. I haven't actually playtested this but the potential is there.

To get people to play this, call it Tron or Snake. That pretty much is all they need to know.

Fun enough, though the rules could use a rewrite. Respawning is described as a much worse thing than it really is. Some aspects, such as counting down from 10 then pointing, even on respawn, feel exorbitant and ill-thought out. The group always balks at doing it.

The box is poorly laid out, as well as having the common bits scattered throughout all four.

Text on the shiny parts is illegible.

Having some retrowave music on in the background severely boost the appeal though.

Regarding its design, Lazer Ryderz is the best game in my collection. Cool looking material, a VHS-game box and super neat characters (LAZER SHAAAAARK). The gameplay is rather simple and reminds me of X-Wing but it's perfect as a little party game with 4 players.

It's like Tron Lightcycles crossed with Car Wars, but "even more 80s!" Take on the role of one of four Ryderz as they race to capture all three Prisms needed to charge the Portal to their next destination.

A rad concept - who wouldn't want to play a light cycle board game? The graphic design is also incredible! This game was on my must-play list. Then I actually played it. All the visual novelty and nostalgia of Lazer Ryderz wears off quick and I found myself constantly frustrated by the game. For example - why on earth would you incorporate a dice-rolling mechanic into a game that requires precise placement of thin cardboard pieces? Without a dice box, you are almost guaranteed to have your carefully laid lazer paths disturbed by a stray dice roll. Or a bump of the table. You also need a rather large table to not have this game get crowded fast and lead to a jumble of "stuff" on the table with constant "putting back" of laid pieces. There's also a mechanic where other players can steal your captured Prisms. Seems cool right? A comeback mechanic! It actually just turns what should be a 15-20 min filler into something that is way longer than it should be with zero strategic depth to justify the length. Just a hard pass for me and I was ready to bite on the hook hard because of the design concept.

I play tested this, and it is a good game, quick to set up, easy to play and it has a lot of fun competitive elements.

It is light, it is competitive, but it doesn't crush players.  The characters are unique enough to give flavor but not powerful enough to be broken.

RATING: 5
A neat concept brought down by a host of small issues.
(1) For a short light game, it take a lot of time to pack up the pieces.  Regular boxes without form fitting interiors would be superior and cheaper.
(2) The box looks great but is terrible at keeping pieces inside it.  It could easily be both.
(3) Rolling dice to see if you move adds the right pressure but is unsatisfying in practice.  The lack of tight turns should be sufficient to punish speeders.
(4) What does it in for me is that if someone else crashed into you, you also suffer.  Let's you and me both lose because I rolled badly".

I had a freaking BLAST playing this game. It's basically the tiles from X-Wing made into a Tron simulation. It's quick, it's crazy, and it's great fun. The box is also so incredible. It's made to look like a video cassette box set, and I just love the damn game. Well done.

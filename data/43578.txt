RATING: 6
This is an excellent next step game for children after they’ve got the basics of playing games down. My just turned 3 year old can play this no problem and I expect most other 3 year olds wouldn’t have a problem either. The excitements that can be created by chasing the monsters into the cupboard make this game shine. It is a memory game that has nice simple mechanics that flow together nicely. This game will bring those little gamers gaming skills to the next level.

With so many memory games out there, it is important to find ones that are uniquely different to add to your collection.

[floatleft][imageid=1878568][/floatleft][thing=43578][/thing] is an excellent [b]cooperative memory [/b]game, especially for energetic tiny table toppers who like to shout and express themselves while playing! The high energy of this game is what makes it stand out among the many, many memory games that are available for tiny table toppers. 

This is also an excellent early opportunity to introduce your Tiny Table Toppers to the awesomeness known as [person=9714][/person]!

On the surface this is Memory but the components are great and the monster timer works perfectly to add just the right amount of tension for a child.  The ability to slightly adjust the game to your child's skill level is a nice touch giving this game more replayability than you would expect.  Great for kids 3-5.

Purchased this game for my 3.5 year old for Christmas. He was able to understand the matching mechanics of the game play and loved it. He wants to play it repeatedly. Art work is great and I imagine this was made to be pitched to Pixar as a Monsters Inc. game for kids.  If you have little ones and want to get them started early, I highly recommend this game!

Memory game for children (3-6). The theme is interesting for them, the gameflow is o.k, it is cooperative, and not too long. They like the graphics. We are o.k with it, all 3 boys (3,5,6) can play together, thats its biggest pro.

As a memory game for children this is quite good. It is easy to learn and has several variants, so that if your child finds the basic level too easy you can make it steadily more challenging. Great art, nice components, easy game play. This is a good one.

3-4 years old gets excited and that is most important thing. Adult is rather bored after a few plays. But it's pretty good and polish edition has really cool artwork.

RATING: 6
It is ok, but very very easy. My 4 years old rarely lost at the hardest level (variety)and that is sad, because I told her the monsters would tickle her if she lost and she's a bit dissapointed every time she wins (talk about irony). Harder than that, it becomes pure luck. On the other hand, I don't know if a three year old would appreciate or find it too hard. I would recommend 3 years old and I will give it a try when my youngest reach that age.

RATING: 6
A twist on memory games for young kids. Instead of finding pairs, players repeatedly look for a single piece among a group of 10, which does not relocate over the course of the game. Cooperative. Rated as a young kids' game.

That said, while there's not much to the game (and rated accordingly), my 2- and 5-year-old are big fans -- sending the monster back to the closet is a hit.

RATING: 7
Je le connaissais déjà sous sa première édition, en petite boîte rectangulaire, datant de 2009.
Les règles de cette version sont identiques (avec toutefois l'ajout de quelques variantes), seuls le format de boîte et les dessins changent.
Le design fait désormais immanquablement penser à "Monstres et Cie" de Pixar, et j'ai quand même une petite préférence pour la toute première version, au design plus original et dont la boîte est plus plus facile à transporter.
En revanche, le système de placard incorporé au fond de boîte est très bien fichu et très amusant pour les enfants.

RATING: 7
Based on one play: A memory game with a cute twist. A collection of face down cards are laid on the table with tiles placed around these cards. At the start a card is flipped depicting a monster and the toy that he is afraid of. In turn order each player must now find the toy that scares off this monster, which is hidden in the face down tiles. Everyone plays together trying to push the monsters back into the closet. If three mistakes are made a new monster appears with a different toy needed to scare it away. Once all the monsters are out, you only have three chances to win by getting rid of all the monsters. Optional tiles include one that shuffles the tiles around and one that instantly brings out a new monster. Great for young kids, the card deck is a little large which may get repetitive so reduce the stack to shorten the game a little. The extra tiles add a little more difficulty once they know the game.

This game works with my 3 year old.  He stays interested long enough to follow the rules, and has the memory skills to find tiles I have forgotten.  Allowing the child to pick the title first, and then having the adult help after keeps interest for the short game. The theme is fine, but the gameplay is not something I am looking for myself.

Rating based upon how eager I am to select this for a game with children.

[Asmodee 2012 edition] {Adult:5; Children:7} {Monster, kid; memory, co-operative} Monster Chase is a cute children game for 4+ years old. It is basically a memory game.  Children has to work together to chase the monster away.  A full game (20 cards) is a little bit long; I think 15 cards is the appropriate length.  This is a really good game for kids.

The basic rules are too easy, even for kids.  The monster-in-a-pack and the Sock tile must be used for a more challenging game.

The card illustration is cute, colorful and fun.  However, the card stock is a little bit thin and would be easily folded by children.

Perfect for what it is: a funny memory game for kids and adults, thanks to the scalable difficulty level (which can be incresed and decreased even further with some house rules), with an interesting theme and good art.

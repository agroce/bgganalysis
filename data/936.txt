RATING: 3
A good idea, but poorly implemented: complex rules, lots of fiddly cardboard chits, and undone by a lousy game mechanic.  When Dracula and a Hunter fight, you *roll a die* to find out if it is Day or Night, with a huge advantage to the Hunters or Dracula respectively.  The only sound tactical decision is not to pick a fight as one die roll will likely determine if you win or lose, and if Dracula loses the game is over.  Now that it has been remade there's no reason to play this one any more; I've traded my copy.

RATING: 9
Best game GW ever produced, Others prefer the FFG version - I don't - this is a game which makes you concentrate very hard, brilliant game, you make the game play, you  dictate the flow... Nothing wrong with a game that relies on the players to  generate the game mechanics to make it sing, as opposed to players relying on the  game mechanics to create the tune for them to dance by.

Finally played this one, and, well... I like it... but it&#039;s just too long for me.  As it is, we aborted the game about two hours in, when, once again, Dracula got lucky enough to escape for the third time - and this time he was really gonna be hard to find again.  But the game systems are cool.

Great game.  Had to reconstruct some bits after buying 'patchy' copy from ebay - huge thanks to whoever posted 'Unpunched chit' on BGG.  Only played a few times since buying (lots in 80's.)  Lots of fun but still need to get a grip on strategy - only played as Drac but have been stabbed to death by mother-in-law twice.

RATING: 5
Played this a quite a few times back in 87 so it must have been OK but my memory of it was that it took a long time and the fight with Dracula weren't that exciting. Nice bits (I had the limited edition miniaturers - how limited was this?) and a good theme BUT that doesn't make it a good game. I have no desire to buy the updated version or introduce this one to my group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like the original game a lot! It's my favorite of the deduction games. The atmosphere and game mechanics are wonderfully inspired by Bram Stoker's Dracula novel.

I had designed the Mina Harker variant in the late 90s so that my girls could more readily share in the fun. Unfortunately, I was "asked" by GW to remove my files I was sharing on BGG when the game was about to be reimplemented as Fury of Dracula by FFG... No hard feelings, since I can undeniably tell my Mina inspired theirs.

RATING: 9
This rating applys to the old GW version, not the newer, horrible FF rehash which destroys the game.

This is an excellent two-player game (one player taking all the investigators); Scotland Yard with deceit.

Dracula secretly seeds the playing-board with his minions and tricks to hamper the three vampire-hunters out to mput an end to the count.  His ultimate goal is to get 6 "live" (???) vampires on the board without the hunters tracking him down.

The game normally works very, very well; but occassionaly the hunters initially have trouble finding Dracky's trail which makes for a very uninteristering game.  (Proabably happened twice out of 50+ plays).  The game is quite strategic and fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
How about an unpunched, unplayed copy of The Fury of Dracula? All charts, counters, rules, and screen are pristine. The metal miniatures are still in their original bag with the original dice. The box shows minimal/negligible wear, although the right side of the box "pooches out" a bit, creating a small crease on the top edge. Obviously, that's pretty insignificant compared to what's inside!

RATING: 9
My favorite gothic horror adventure game. Even though it's basically a deduction game, the Dracula role and the Hunter roles play very differently, and it has a great thematic feel. Seems more fast paced than it would suggest at first glance. Take my advice: to enjoy this game the most, use counters to mark places where Dracula could be after turning up locations in his trail, and never let a token fall off the edge of his trail, since it could be a maturing vampire!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This game frustrates me. The hidden movement of Dracula is wonderfully executed as well as the sub-game of leaving nasty surprises for the hunters. The hunters often make the mistake of thinking it is a simple game of probability to guess where Dracula is but in truth it is about behaving unexpectedly and bluffing. Love that part!

Problem is that when the hunters eventually find Dracula (have actually had games where they never did!) or when Dracula decides to swoop down on them during nighttime, the combat mechanics kill all elements of joy. It gives you the illusion of strategy but is in fact completely random. It is so broken that it kills the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Among the very best translations of a book to a game. Excellent atmosphere and theme accentuated by cool metal (or perhaps plastic) figurines. Takes Scotland Yard and squares it with theme and chrome. It's particularly fun to have read the book-- or watched Coppola's movie-- and then jump into this. And to think that GAMES WORKSHOP did this! (And thank goodness they did. This sort of thing would be right up their alley if they ever went back to making boardgames.)

My favourite Games Workshop game. The co-operative aspect makes it different and you can get that element of suspense that you don't get in a lot of other games!

RATING: 8
Great game of the book (not the films), best as a 2-player. If you find the hunters win too often allow Dracula an extra action chit, that really helps. Wish I could convince people to play more often - current gaming group considers it purely 2 player :(

Now have the reprint, so I suspect this will see even less play now.

RATING: 7
Rating is based on a few plays.  The game has great theme, but it seems really long, and the idea of Dracula running around and hiding (instead of actively fighting people) doesn't fit my (possibly misinformed) notions of a vampire.  Interesting asymmetric design, but the game feels like it's longer than it needs to be.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great game.  The Dracula hidden movement system really works well.  (But don't play this game with anyone you'd even mildly suspect of cheating.  You have to implicitly trust the Dracula player to play honestly.)

RATING: 8
A great experience game - especially for those of us brought up on Hammer House of Horror. Played a lot at the time; always tight and in the balance but the 'Dracula teleports' card spolied that and doubled the length of the game so we played without it and then the advantage seemed to be slightly with the hunters and it was always a great coup for Dracula to win (which still happened enough to keep it interesting).  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Not played this for a few years now, but would still like to given the opportunity. Unlike Colditz which has a similar system where one player is pitted against everyone else, this one really works and feels more balanced and we never had any problems with no-one wanting to play Dracula. 

Great theme, reasonable mechanics make for an enjoyable game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's an extremely tense game, with plenty of moments were you jump up and high five your teammates (or yourself, if you're Dracula), and plenty of moments where you feel it's completely hopeless. I enjoyed it plenty, and I hope to get it to the table more often.

The dracula player has to be willing to leave encounters in his wake to make it fun, and the card allowing dracula to just bleep to anywhere else on the board should be removed.

I've played this one once with my brother in-law and had a pretty good time.  I think some of the rules are fiddly, and it took one game just to get them down.  Unfortunately, in the intervening time I think I've forgotten everything, but I would like to play again some time.  The volume of chits, etc, make it a little time consuming to set up, and not easy to play with little ones running around.  This game is oozing with flavor, as usual with the old GW games.

Theme weighs in heavily in making this game fun to play. You definitely need the tense, creepy music playing. (Talking about the original version here). The mapboard is beautiful old-style. I hope (but fear this won't be the case) that the new reprint keeps all the original game and simply upgrades the components. I am afraid we'll see a number of tweaks that are supposed to be 'improvements' and are not.

The combat system is reminiscent of Dune, with the rock/paper/scissors thing and a few twists thrown in. There are a number of weapons available that interact differently with different foes.

I also really dig the feel of the 'hunt' for Dracula. There is building excitement as you gather clues, get hot on the trail...and start to close the net. The comparisons with Scotland Yard are apt, but SY is more of a skeleton compared with this fleshed-out masterpiece. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Candles instead of electric light and music from the film Gothic playing.  None of this rescued this game for me it took a long time and the pay back was just not enough.

NB
I'm becomming aware that abstract games are not my taste and this refects in my opinion of many games).  The theme on many simple games are painted on to level I find difficult.

Games in this grouping:
Taluva
Lost Cities
Bohanza
Jet Set
Junta
Enemy in Sight
Naval War

Some more complex game have a level of abstration that does not meet my expectation for the theme/subject etc.  This makes the game a less compelling experience.

Games in this grouping:
Elder Signs
Reef Encounter
Modern Naval Battles
The Fury of Dracula

My enthusiasm for these games is limited by a level of abstraction that challenges my taste and my rating reflects this.

Absolutely perfect.  Well worth a fat investment on Ebay as this is a far cooler game than whatever 3 or 4 European family games you can buy for the same price.  The Dracula theme and gothic atmosphere are perfectly evoked by the components, mechanics, and rules.  Really it plays something like a more advanced Scotland Yard but with a great (and fun) combat system and lots more strategic options.  I would say that this is easily one of the top 5 games I've ever played.  I want it so bad I can taste it...blood!

One of my all time favorites! It is great with 2-4, but I personally feel it is the most fun with a full compliment of four. It can be a turkey shoot trying to find Dracula, but man it is sure fun looking.

This is a classic from the heyday of Games Workshop when they actually made good games. Now they just shove overpriced miniatures and constant Warhammer 40K rule reiterations down peoples throats. Oh, for the old Games Workshop...

I really can't stand the new FFG version. I wanted to like it, but it, like a lot of their games, is just too bloody fiddly for it's own good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
When starting to play the game I was wondering if it would end up being too simple. Go to this city...get stuff...reveal Dracula...get more stuff to fight him...etc. But I found that the cat and mouse game really IS intriguing in this game. I also played Dracula and found that I had to make some big decisions to try and outsmart the hunters by doing the unexpected. The game came down to a battle in which one final round of combat would decide who won. It was very exciting and everybody at the table was into it. Great themed game full of vampiric enjoyment.

A thematically rich "hunt for Dracula" game. Players work cooperatively to track down and capture the player in control of Dracula, while he tries to elude them.

Great assymetrical game of hide-seek.  Need players who play quickly and don't get frustrated when/if they can't find the Count.  I play that Dracula must always leave an encounter behind if possible.  Also, he must always move unless "passing" or placing an encounter in current town.

After many, many years, finally got around to playing it again.  I still like it...more than the FFG version...though I think they both rate a 7.

Amazing game by Stephen Hand, who obviously had read and loved Bram Stoker's book, Dracula.  The hunters work together on an open map of Europe, combing for Dracula.  The Dracula player works in secret, laying hinderances for the hunters and trying for form his vampiric empire.  It plays sort of like Scotland Yard, oozes theme, and is far and away the best boardgame Games Workshop came out with before they went Warhammer.  A must buy, especially if you're into Gothic horror.  The Fantasy Flight remake didn't improve it.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
After one play so far, I am a little torn. One the one hand the game play and detail and mechanisms are awesome. However, there is a fair amount of cambat which is very uninspired. Too bad the dice factor heavily outweighs the weapon-interaction factor. Just one gripe in an otherwise awesome strategy game... scores high only on theme, as gmeplay is a tad slow and hunters spend an awful lot of time blundering about.

Bought this ages ago and half-played it once in a solo runthrough to pick up the rules. Ended up panic-buying the new version before it became hard to find and now don't fancy this one so much. The GM screen gave me D&D flashbacks and I remember not being able to see the difference between the different figures, whereas those things are not an issue with the new version. Would like to give it a whirl some time but wonder if/when I won't just reach for the new version instead.

The hunt/hide aspects for the respective sides are really different in flavour, and the experience of being Dracula is great - you have much more knowledge and an illusion of great power and many options. I like this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
An old style chase game, seems too heavy and clumsy by modern standards (yes, I know it re-issued). Lots of conditional rules and a lumbering rules-set in the old GW form make hard going for a relatively simple game. But the whole ambience is strongly vampiric and Dracula is a terrible foe. The Scotland Yard chase mechanism is okay, but dependant more on event cards forcing a show than the few Hunters actually deducing where Mikeula is. And our game ended on a totally random event. Mikeula was forced to reveal he was in marseilles. Jonathan Harker popped up, immediately attacked with random weapons, which happened to include a stake. Bang! Mikeula was killed and the game was over. Not bad at that stage, another hour and it would have been a mercy killing.

RATING: 7.5
I've been playing the FFG version, but I've finally had to come down and say I prefer the older one. The components aren't as nice, there is scope for Dracula cheating (not that this is a problem with my normal gaming groups), and it's a simpler game. But I feel this simplicity helps the mechanics to stay out of the way of the cat & mouse gameplay.

RATING: 6
It's a bit dated but the core mechanism makes it such fun.  Let down by the rather arbitrary means by which Dracula's position is usually revealed - event cards.

Bought this original Games Workshop version for a bargain when it first came out, and unbelievably haven't played a game yet!

Update: After 19 years since purchased, finally played half a 2P game.  The Hunter player ran around in circles most of the game, not really getting even close to Dracula.  Seems tough for the hunters. It was fun, but will reserve rating until after one more play.

RATING: 9
One of the best old GW games. Oustanding theme and atmosphere. Game mechanics are a little bit flawed, though. Actually if the Dracula player plays only to win, he will for sure win, and the game gets boring. I like the suggestion of having Dracula be forced to get a Major victory to win.

RATING: 6
Vaguely like Scotland Yard, with RPG elements layered on top.  Staying on Dracula's tail is not terribly difficult, yet he can be difficult to corner... and if Dracula feels like being evasive, the game can clearly drag on endlessly.

Not really my thing; Scotland Yard feels much more elegant to me, and requires more careful teamwork and deduction on the part of the detectives.

Rich in theme, great design.  Truly one of GW's best boardgames.  Why oh why did they give up on making boardgames??  This is a fun game, especially if you get into the theme, but it can drag a bit just like the Fantasy Flight version.  Although the components are improved with the new FF version, I think I prefer this version more.  Dracula is tougher, and going after him is riskier and the game is more tense.

The premise is great, and some of the mechanics work well, but overall the game is a bit boring.  As Dracula you feel under powered and spend most of your time running and hiding, just wearing down the investigators.  As the hunters you just need to get the right combination of weapons first and then not pick up anything else, just in case you give something to Dracula.  It's all a little bit broken, although apparently the later editions fix a lot of what is wrong.

RATING: 2
(copy and pasted from my comment on 3rd edition, as the differences between all the editions do not impact the core issues I have with this game)

You could not design a game less for me than this one if you tried to. I think the biggest problem for me is that I do not find the core puzzle of deducing where Dracula could be engaging at all. Perhaps if it was contained within a game that was not seemingly designed to last forever, it might hold my interest longer, but as it is, it seems that skillful and/or lucky play by Dracula results in a game where *nothing happens* for hours. For at least 2 of the 3 times I've played this, we've called the game at the 3 hour mark when it was clear that we had at least 1-2 more hours remaining.

I do have to give this game credit for something though. It's the perfect illustration to me that what constitutes good game design is ultimately a subjective thing, as lots of people, including friends of mine, clearly love to play this game and it's unlikely they are all pretending to like it just to mess with me. :-D

A great game.... to play once in a while.  The game is good, fun, and immersive. However, the feel of the game is occasionally repetitive and becomes drawn out.  Not a game for the Desert Island Top 10 but played once a year or so, its fantastic.  I had the original version and a friend has the new FFG version.  The FFG version looks 100% better but I prefer the nastier game play of the original.

Asymmetric fun.  I enjoy games where I have to get into my opponent's head.  Also an excellent entry into the scant horror genre.  The downside is that the game can sometimes draaaaag on if Dracula is cautious.  The combat system is a little lifeless, and could use work.  This game screams out for a new edition to fix some of its issues and turn it into a gem!

Update: careful what you wish for!  I'm not fond of the new FFG edition.

Unbalanced, but fun. As long as you accept the notion that Dracula is just tough to beat and the game won't be fair, then this game is easy to like. Makes beating Dracula that much better when it happens. But, really, if the game were better balanced, I'd score this higher. I hear the FFG version pushes the balance too far in the other direction.

This game is very atmospheric. Using a card system, you have the powers of darkness at your dispoasl while playing the Count. As the hunters, you have a nice co-op mode as you race to uncover clues as to the whereabouts of Dracula. But that's not all. When you find him, you have got to best him in combat. So you need to make sure you are well equipped before confronting him. The game plays very well with an aggressive Dracula player, except for the actual combat mechanics which need some refining. When you play this game you feel like you are writing a new chapter in the Dracula story. This is the original GW version.

This does a great job of putting you in the book. You really get the feel of being Van Helsing hunting the evil vampire across the land. Or Dracula trying to stay one step ahead of the hunters. I feel the cards were ingenious for the times, the hunters are the only one who can draw them but they risk helping Dracula. And help him they will. I prefer this one over the new because it is a bit more of a challenge for the hunters, not that it's a walkthrough fot the Dracula player. I also prefer my hunters to stay dead when I kill them.

Probably 7.5 from Dracula's point of view but can be a 6 from the Vampire Killers perspective unless you play with the right people. This version looks sexier than the latest release from Dracula's point of view since he has the hidden board to look at.

RATING: 7
An interesting Dracula vs. a co-operative "vampire hunters" team game (similiar to Scotland Yard & Buffy the Vampire Slayer game); great theme and worth the play but I suspect a slight improvement with the combat probabilities system could be worked to balance out (perhaps not to my optimal tastes).  The card allowing Dracula to 'teleport' anywhere seems extremely powerful (perhaps a card or special weapon/item allowing the hunters to counteract that might make it more fair).

RATING: 3
[Played twice]
Good theme, not much strategy, lot of luck (cards and dice).
Sometimes it simply "drags", with nothing of interest happening; this is especially likely if Dracula is a "shy" player.
Four players emphasize the cooperative aspect, but a player may be eliminated early in the game (making an awful experience for him).
Cards aren't balanced: a bunch of them is ridiculously overpowered, at the point that drawing them may win (or lose) the game for you; not very satisfying.
Combat system is totally random (rock-paper-scissor and dice rolling), but often it has important effects on the game, as eliminating a player or assigning the final victory.
A typical GW-game from the '80s, it's just that: dated.
Update: -1 to its rating as a new (improved) version is now available.

THE Vampire game. With inexperienced players in can be a bit too long and random, but once everybody's played once or twice, it's a truly wonderful mix of tension and fun. I tend to leave one or two stakes out of the mix and make the vamps a tad more difficult to kill if Dracula is new to the game to make combat a bit more survivable for him. Plays okay with two players, but way better with four.

There's a lot to like about this game - it's mysterious and tense and absolutely dripping with atmosphere.

Just played this game again, as it has been quite a while (probably close to ten years).  I own the GW version.  The game, if played at a brisk pace is fun.  The real excitement starts when combat occurs.  If Dracula plays a defensive game it can drag...

Dracula is best at night and always should try to fight at night to damage the hunters.  I don't think I like the fact that the hunters can fight Dracula and then search for weapons/event cards in the same turn.  I feel the fight should be their action instead.  Maybe we were playing this incorrectly.  

I really wonder how the revised edition compares?  

The game, however, is dripping with theme.  It feels a bit outdated but I am glad I still have it in my collection.

Edit: Played again. Starts out fun, but then it again went way too long, became too slow moving, and suffered from annoying card play and die rolls. A frustrating experience.

Well I finally got a chance to play this after wanting to for several years.  My impression?  A typial Games Workshop game.  Good fun typical GW components and rules (!) a higher random element than we're used to these days (not saying thats a bad thing), but above all plenty of atmosphere.  I'd play it again but I'm in no rush to do so (though I'm keen to try the FF version now!)

Really enjoyed my single playthrough of this.  Two players.  Liked the 80's components - thin cardstock and charming art - but never played the FFG reprint for comparison.

Hunters lucked into my Dracula early on (though I was trying to play it a bit too cute) and the hunt was on from there with little down time.

The oft-discussed combat was fine, though it ended a bit abruptly with a daytime stake through my heart.

It's obviously a decent game if you prefer theme over some mechanics that would preferably engage and interest you ...

Imagine the Scotland Yard mechanic. Dracula is moving secretly, being chased between the cities of Europe (connected by roads, trains and sea) by three detectives. Even though it's made harder than Scotland Yard by allowing only three detectives, make it harder still by allowing Dracula to stay still and, if he moves, to offer no clues. If you do land on him, you have to defeat him in combat to win, only make it virtually impossible for the detectives to win unless they have a stake. But only make 3 of the 30-40 weapons to be stakes. And if you don't kill Dracula, allow him to escape with no clues as to which direction. Oh, and if Dracula reaches a port, he can travel via sea to any other port, leaving no clues as to where, meaning you have to start all over again. And if finally you net him down, he simply plays his evasion card and teleports anywhere on the board, so starting the whole process again. Fun, eh? Not.

There's more to it of course. Dracula can leave wolves and plagues and other nasties behind in cities where's he's been, so at least you know occasionally where he's been. If you land in the city he last was, he reveals that fact. Each time you enter a city / town, you get to pick up weapon chits and or event cards, and some of the event cards force Dracula to reveal himself. Combat with Dracula and the nasties incurs wounds / bites which kill you or turn you into a vampire. There's healing events which counter these. Dracula has 12 (or 24?) blood points before he dies and these can be expended when travelling by sea (so there's a cost at least) or in combat.

Dracula wins by placing 6 vampires nasties out (he has to collect them via a draw mechanic first). The detectives win by finding and killing Dracula.

The game is probably ideal with 2 players (same as Scotland Yard) and is themed well with a nice map, good bits - and that's about all it has going for it. It just seemed too much like wandering in the dark, not much deductive work, and then succumb to the luck of the events and the combat (play weapon chits, dice rolls applied to a result matrix). Bearable if you're entranced by the theme. I put it down as an educational experience.

Played this once at uni. I was an English aristocrat and Dracula tried to hypnotise me. This would have worked if I had had any weapon except a stake. I had a stake. End of Game.

RATING: 10
I think this may be the most fun game I have ever played. My friends and I have had so many laughs, and never get bored of it. I believe all copies have one misprinted card back, so we have Dracula keep tha cards behind his screen and ask him for cards when the hunters want them. Gets too tense as a two player game, three is much better and four is terrific. Everyone loves being Dracula, even though there's much more pressure on him. If Drac is agressive it's more fun than if he's hiding and letting his minions wear down the hunters. The melee system and action cards makes this so much better than Scotland Yard, which is the same in overall play, but doesn't compare to FOD. If you see it, get it.

Demoed pre-release of new edition at GenCon, but I never played the old edition ... It's like a cross between Scotland Yard/Ghost Chase and the Buffy tVS board game.

I'm a big vampire junkie, so it's no surprise that I love this game. Way cool concept and bits and a nice blend of strategy and luck. When I play, we ignore victory points and the humans always co-operate. Dracula would eat them alive if they were all in it just for themselves.

This is the 1987 version. My wife LOVES this game. It can get bogged down or be over very suddenly, if the cards fall wrong. But it can also be great fun. The Dracula theme runs deep and rich and isn't just pasted onto an abstract game. The 2006 version from Fantasy Flight Games is a big improvement on the original and fixes most of the worst flaws.

My review of the 2006 version, with comparisons to this 1987 version, is here:

RATING: 8
Few games are as intensely immersed in their theme as Fury of Dracula... it would be fun to play even if it was a poor game. Fortunately, however, it is a very good game; one that must be played a few times before you can discover what the best strategies might be. The game can run a bit too long, perhaps... and can often turn on a single choice made during a combat... but hunting the evil Count through the cities of old Europe (or attempting to elude the hunters) is great fun. A perfect game to play on Halloween, or any time you want to have a "talk like Bela Lugosi" night (Dracula players tend to really get into their "role").
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun game. While similar to Scotland Yard, this is a more random game and has more theme to it.  Its more about trying to get to Dracula when you have good stuff to fight him with than it is a puzzle to figure out where he is hiding.  Of course, maybe our playing was unique in that we knew where he was most of the time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
With a nice map and nifty bits, it's a Transylvanian Scotland Yard.  Thing is that every so often Dracula can teleport anywhere, and this creates the very real possibility of epic marathon games where the hunters are continually going back to Square One.  Such an eventuality can lead to (believe me) a profoundly unsatisfying experience.

Nice theme - feels like a hunt for Dracula especially when the hunters close in on the trail.  Can be a bit slow at start - but the hunters need to work together (don't forget that it is a cooperative game for the hunters).  There might be some downtime, waiting, possible runs of bad luck (can't get a train to move, stuck in fog, storm etc).  It is this excessive length that takes the rating down a notch or two as one really needs to set aside the time for this game.

I'm rating this based on memory. I got the game as a gift when it was first released, but had a hard time finding multiple opponents. I only ever got to play with 2 players, but I really liked the game. I eventually gave it away because I had no one to play it with - now I'm kicking myself, as I have the people to play it with, and I have such fond memories. It actually inspired me to make my own game, well before I was even aware of "German" boardgames. Update: I'll be getting the new FFG version! Thank you, FFG. Update: didn't care for reprint - warm glow of original gets it a higher rating.

I only played it once.  I'm told that some games can finish in 10 minutes.  My game lasted about 3 1/2 hours!  I think that's way too long for most non-wargames.  Also I've found that I don't like "hide-and-seek/ mind reading" games with minimal information like Hoity Toity and Pirate's Cove.

Cool game, filled to the brim with theme, but man can this game drag.  It gets really obnoxious with all the lost turns.  One time we spent an hour without finding Dracula nor his minions, we finally got a card that forced him to appear, and then he teleported away.  Also, one character was lost in fog for 45 min. due to bad die rolls.  Sigh.  When it is fun it is a blast, but players must endure a couple hours of downtime.  grrr.

This is one of those games that gets better each time you play it with the same group of people.  Once you discover the tendencies of your opponents things become very interesting, though it may take a few games to become familiar with each player's style.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Good theme, not much strategy, lot of luck (cards and dice).
Sometimes it simply "drags", with nothing of interest happening; this is especially likely if Dracula is a "shy" player.
Four players emphasize the cooperative aspect, but a player may be eliminated early in the game (making an awful experience for him).
Cards aren't balanced: a bunch of them is ridiculously overpowered, at the point that drawing them may win (or lose) the game for you; not very satisfying.
Combat system is totally random (rock-paper-scissor and dice rolling), but often it has important effects on the game, as eliminating a player or assigning the final victory.
A typical GW-game from the '80s, it's just that: dated.
Update: -1 to its rating as a new (improved) version is now available.

Having a Dracula player dedicated to mixing it up with the Hunters is vital; if you have that, this game is a goldmine.

Old deluxe edition with the lead minis. Great theme and the good old Scotland Yard gameplay. Drawbacks are the bit too random fights and that it doesn't have a fixed ending. After 3 hours you can be at the same state as you where at the beginning of the game. Really would love to play the reprint.

12/23/05 - RATING 5 (GW version):  After 2 games of me playing Dracula, I found myself utterly uninterested in the game.  The hunters playing declared that the game was the most boring game of all time.  

This game is totally dated.  Hunting for Dracula in the beginning sucks because he has not had any time to leave clues.  Dracula going to sea is a great defense, but is totally boring for everyone.  The encounters are not exciting at all.  I just thought this game didn't have much going for it.  I'd play it again to see if I was wrong about it, but I doubt I will ever have the chance after all of the rancor toward it.

Very enjoyable, though potentially long, game.  Almost 2 entirely different games too, as playing as Dracula is so HUGELY different to playing as a hunter.  Rich in atmosphere too, definitely one for vampire nuts.

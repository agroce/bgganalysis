I'm one of the folks who anticipated it after playing Red Winter, but in the end, it was just too much game for me.  Back in the 1980s when driving was illegal and females were intimidating and shaving was something that happened to older kids, yeah, I could have devoted the time to going through all of those training scenarios.  But now, with a family and work?  Not really.

It's a great looking package and the designer really puts in the effort with documentation that is second-to-none, but I fear this game was a case of "design creep."  A veteran designer once said young designers try to put the kitchen sink in the games and the result makes them unplayable, whereas Jim Dunnigan always believed you should filter as much history through no more than 3 mechanics and let the rest go.  Red Winter was the Dunnigan theory applied and this was an example of the other instance.

I gave it to a guy who I hope loves it.

RATING: 2.5
Why a 2.5 ? It is to warn people that this is a pure wargame in the most traditional sense possible: a brick of a rule set, not playable unless you want to devote 30 days of your life learning the full game with all whistles and bells.
As a simulation of a real battle, it "may" be worth investing time in it, but unless your grandfather fought in it, I doubt it will have a meaning really... and I doubt very much your grandfather would recognize the battlefield and conditions any way.

I don't know ... when are some designers going to recognise that including everything you think about should not be thrown at a player? And ... frankly there is a difference between number crunching and seeing a battle unfold.

Perhaps I am spoiled by designers like John Butterfield or Brimmicomb-Wood, but this game doesn't even touch their playability of "wargames".

I am also dissappointed by the rating of GMT: 6? complexity? I would put it on par with basic 3Reich at the very least. Only ... I think that an operational/tactical game really is not in the same investment as a grand strategic game of WW2.

The designer created a game he loves of course but these kind of games are meant to be played instead of browsing through components and be stocked on a shelf as a reference to being a "real" wargamer. And GMT should be careful with putting out too many of these products to a public that will BUY them regardless but hardly play them...

I am CONVINCED less than a few % of its buyers will even play the FULL game ever really. Oh no doubt the game will get fantastic reviews of the LEARNING scenarios and INTRODUCTION fights, but like so many games these days it will be shelved by those giving 9+ before they even play the full orchestrated opera. Be weary folks.

So the 2.5 represents a warning to potential buyers really. ONLY if you want to devote a rather large portion of your precious time to learn this game AND have an equally devoted partner that will learn the rules with you on this ONE particular WW2 small battlefield that NEEDS to be played at least 2 times a year or you will have to relearn everything, you will have fun with it. 

The rest of us should stick to (war)games that are at least more universal and fun/playable. As a reference look at my top 10 games. Labyrinth, CoH, DDay series of Butterfield, Wing Leader and yes the likes of Ambush or even 3 Reich...

Was really excited to open it!  Beautiful components.  Interesting to read through all the materials.  I could tell they put a lot of thought and time into designing the rule book and player aids.  That was my first impression.  Then I started (tried) playing it...err did the simulation.

As a game, it was not fun.  It was work.  Even after several weekends it still felt more like work than play.  Rules are waayyy too detailed and fidly.  It seemed like they went overboard trying to cram in as much realism as possible at the expense of playability.  If I wanted a simulation, I'd hop on the computer and play something in the Close Combat series.  Computer games can enforce all the special rules and make the calculations in milliseconds. But I digress...

My guess is many of the high rankings come from solitaire grognards or collectors impressed by the beautiful printing.  To each their own. But good luck completing a campaign face-to-face...before your groceries run out. 

This was too much simulation -- not enough game.  Sold.

RATING: 5
So far it feels very over-complicated and burdened with chrome rules, special exceptions, and complex sub-systems (just one example: there are 5 different modifiers for flanking fire, depending on the type of target vehicle).
Good luck even trying a real (non-tutorial) scenario without many hours spent learning and studying.

Map readability is poor - hex numbers are green on green, and the hatch marks indicating elevation change are hard to see, and effectively invisible in the darker terrain.

Table space requirements are high for a single-map game - you'll need to lay out 3 8x11 and an 11x17 card in addition to the map.  

A real disappointment compared to Red Winter. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
An excellent treatise of a rather obscure battle at the grand tactical level, and the first grand tactical scale game that I truly, truly enjoy. Systems like the MMP GTS focus on maneuver and dislocation really well, given the size of their maps and counter mixes. This one however shines on bringing through its various mechanisms the true nature of combined arms company-level fighting. 

One cannot but wonder, when seeing the map for the first time, whether this is all there is, and whether there is enough replayability in the game to make learning the system worth it. Well, I would like to state unequivocally that yes, it is very well worth it. This is an excellent system for the scale, and one that I see  having a very bright future. The passion of the designer, for whom this series is clearly a labor of love, the quality of the game system and the thought behind it, and the amazing material included in the game make this a true winner. What started with Red Winter culminates with Operation Dauntless into the defacto grand tactical scale level game system. An amazing game and one that all wargamers should try out.

+ amazing combined arms system, highly thematic but also intuitive
+ well thought out subsystems that are traditionally tricky (LOS, AT firing et al)
+ tremendous opportunity for strategcic and tactical play
+ wonderful components (map excepting), including 3 sizeable booklets with tons of historical information
+ high degree of usability, including large counters, and zero stacking requirement
+ excellent replayability, including the 10 or so tutorials that are well worth it
+ fantastic support on the geek and on consimworld from the designer
+ scenarios have different lengths and can be easily played in one sitting
+ very tight and solid ruleset, reminds me of Chad Jensen's ones.
+ almost zero (so far) errata

= steep learning curve, not due to rules length, but due to the inherent complexity of the system. It is well advised to pace through the scenarios. This is definitely a game that requires moderate study of the system

- the paper map is not of good quality. Mine, after just a few hours under plexi showed seam whitening, and I doubt it will last for a long time. In addition, slopes are hard to read under any but perfect lighting. GMT, please reissue a lighter and higher quality map.

It's easily the most comprehensive game I own as far as mechanics--infantry, tanks, LOS with elevation, weather effects, terrain effects, day/night effects, friction fire, anti-tank fire, ranged attacks, strongpoints and "dug-in", reinforcements and off-map artillary/air support, transports , and the list goes on....

Great support from the designer!

Cons: (1) it can feel intimidating / exhausting to play, at least for me.  The amount of decision points might be a little too high for me.
(2) managing the counters can be frustrating / time consuming.

[11/3/17] rating: 4
[I should consider selling this if I still can't get into it]
I set this back up to play again, and actually just gave up before completing the first turn.  The intimidation is worse than I remember.  And I have other games where the theme draws me in more that I can overcome the intimidation.  Here, I don't have that.

RATING: N/A
Looks kind of interesting, but probably not enough to tempt me to try and learn it. My time is limited enough that if I'm going to put in that amount of effort, I want it to apply to multiple games. (I realize this is a sequel to Red Winter, but it's not exactly TCS.)

Along those lines, I don't understand why people are trashing the game simply because it's detailed and chromey. The rulebook is posted right here for anyone to look at before deciding whether to buy it.

After playing and really enjoying Red Winter I pre-ordered this game by the same designer. When it arrived, I was really impressed. The map and unit pieces are beautiful. There are player aids for each player. And there is loads of information in the four included books: Rule Book, Scenario Book, Play Book, and Reference Book. Then I came to the Rule Book. This is a complex game. While I enjoyed it and think it models combat extremely well, it is not for everybody. 

There are two types of attacks: Assault and Combat and most units can use three types of fire: Combat Strength (CS), Ranged Attack Strength (RAS), and Anti-Tank (AT). There are numerous ways to resolve attacks: Combat Table, Ranged Attack Table and Anti-Armor Table. There is also the Tactical Advantage system when an armored unit is assaulting a hex with an anti-armor capable unit, and there is the Armor Reaction Cycle (ARC) for armor units attacking each other.

If this seems like a lot, it is. You have to weigh your decisions very carefully, even from the time you set up. Because of unit design and hex stacking limitations, it is difficult to obtain a true overrun situation. But it's not impossible. More times than not a Combat or Assault will result in a single step reduction and/or retreat, which seems very realistic to me. 

As I said, this game is not for everyone. If you want to send your troops forward, roll the dice and smash the enemy, stick with Memoir '44 or Command and Colors. If you want a game that gets you down into the nitty-gritty of how to best deploy your units and you don't mind constantly weighing options and calculations in your head, you might consider Operation Dauntless.

I probably would have rated this an 8 if I thought I could get it on the table more.

Very disappointed.  I was expecting a game as playable as Red Winter and OD is a very complex game with a monster length campaign.  Even if I spent the time to do 10 tutorials to learn the system, no opponent that I know would put that kind of time into it.  Reading the examples gives the impression of an excruciatingly slow game with tons of analysis required to even figure out all of the angles to taking a single hex.  

When there are 24 bullet points required to highlight the differences to Red Winter, I think it is clear that the relationship between the two is distant.  I dispute the designer's statement that the complexity increase is "not a large step"; It is at least a 50% increase, and since the added items are systems that you have to know to do basic moves (e.g. entering the wrong field could trigger a massive response fire exchange), I think the raw page count of rules doesn't tell the whole story.  There's also a lot of chrome special rules regarding certain units that are harder to remember than a system you use frequently.

The game really is a masterclass on production, though.  Research and detail is amazing.  My rating is entirely based on how much I want to play it, not the quality of the game design and production.

As an aside, the complexity of this game convinced me to give the latest version of the computer game Combat Mission a spin.  Really, if you want an elaborate simulation of ground combat, I think a computer game will work better, especially by the inclusion of fog-of-war.  Then, you spend your time thinking about the orders you would like to do, rather than all the rules for how it happens.

Best handling of WWII combined arms combat that I've ever seen. Fun, fast, and packed with so much extras that you could choke a cow. The designer's passion, the clear rules writing, the transparency in his designer's notes, the surprisingly thorough historical notes and the overall welcoming and inclusive attitude of the game, with its many, varied and fun introductionary scenarios, makes Operation Dauntless, despite the complexity, as a game that I'd easily recommend to someone as a 'first wargame'. For a seasoned grognard, it's of course a total MUST BUY.

This rating might very well change after playing the game; my current rating is solely about the incredible amount of quality content in the box - so good, in fact, that I am compelled to point this out before putting counters on the map! All wargames require research be done, of course, but rarely is that research translated from legal pad notes to beautifully formatted books and player aids. With this game is a rulebook (of course), a reference book, a scenario book, and a playbook...all of at least 30 pages each. A buyer certainly gets their money's worth. Another labor of love AND thinking from Mark M.

I had high hopes for this game, but in the end it was quite mess. Generally I do not like these igo ugo games anymore, too many different types of combat, so game felt quite mechanical, not always this seemed to add anything meaningful to game.

Given that scale is not so much different I have enjoyed Greatest Day from GTS system much more. Not discussing that GTS is much nicer visually.

RATING: 4
Preordered on the quality of [gameid=38786].

Some of those playtest shots, with thick carpets of counter stacks, are making me a little uneasy, though.  Reminds me of the first OCS Tunisia scenario I set up; it was physically unplayable.  UPDATE: the designer says the final map will have hexes big enough to fit the units themselves side-by-side, so I'm not so worried about it now.

[b]Update[/b] two years later: HOLY CRAP I can't believe how much [i]stuff[/i] is in this box.  Over 160 pages of rulebook/playbook/scenarios/reference/historical notes, 5 tutorial scenarios--if the game is [i]fun,[/i] there's enough in here to keep you busy for a long, long time.  This goes far beyond "labor of love," more like "labor of unhealthy obsession," but I have no problem benefiting from that, ha ha.

I'm a little worried about the increases in complexity over Red Winter--and there, the tutorial scenario was 15 minutes; here, the first tutorial is an hour... not including the 20 minutes you'll spend trying to figure out which units you're supposed to use!

In addition to counter trays & plexiglas, you better put reading glasses & 100-watt bulbs on your shopping list; 2-point light green text on a mottled medium-green background or dark-dark-gray-on-black [i]looks[/i] nice, and definitely lets you know there's some information there you might want to have a closer look at.

[b]Update:[/b] [i]learning[/i] this game takes--no joke--as long as [i]playing[/i] the Red Winter campaign game.  And after playing 10+ hours of tutorial scenarios & 6 hours on the first real scenario, the time spent making high-level decisions about where your units will go & what they'll do is still being dwarfed by the amount of time spent on basic arithmetic.  The game is [i]very[/i] heavy on procedure, and even deciding whether or not to take a shot at an enemy unit involves figuring out whether that'll improve the enemy's odds of hitting you with return fire more than your chance of hitting the enemy.  (So does deciding whether it's better to do an assault or a combat, or whether it's better to support your tanks with infantry in an assault--with the Fire Control optional rule, bringing infantry along can keep your tanks from getting to fire at enemy tanks before the assault*--so you wind up running through multiple units & styles of attack, each with a page of DRMs, to figure out which combat system is the right way to achieve the effect you want.)  I hate to come to this conclusion after that much of a time investment, but this is [b]too much game for me;[/b] I'd rather play Red Winter.

[size=7]* Two Firefly-enhanced Shermans in light bocage are considering assaulting a halftrack in close terrain.  You learned in an earlier tutorial that armor is vulnerable to infantry assault if it's not supported by infantry of its own; but, by including a step of infantry in your assault, you change from drawing 3 (-2 terrain, +2 AT vehicle steps, +2 Fire Control = attacker draws 3, probably eliminating the armored car with AT fire) to the [i]defender[/i] drawing 2 (1 infantry step, -2 terrain = defender draws 2), which means you probably don't get any AT shots, fail the assault, and lose that step of infantry.  Figuring out when to include infantry means running through the Tactical Advantage DRMs twice and the CRT DRMs once; that doesn't include figuring out whether it's better to use AT fire instead of an assault during the action phase, or to make that same AT fire during the combat phase instead.[/size]

RATING: 7
Looks like a solid, new scale and system on company level actions.   Covering 12th SS Panzer Division "Hitlerjugend" (Hitler Youth) and Panzer Lehr- elite panzergrenadier units, there are lots of tanks on both sides in the game.  
I hope that the details on armor/anti-tank (Sherman, Tiger and AT guns) rules may give rise to whole new workable system showing the intensity at tactical-operational level warfare. Opposing the Germans was the British 49th Infantry Division a.k.a "The Polar Bears" near Caen in codename "Operation Dauntless". Many scenarios dissecting different phases in the operations - from initial assault by the British to the counterattack by the German.  This game seems to be the boardgame version of the very popular "Company of Heroes". A map verdant and luxuriant, awesome looking.

RATING: 8
Operation Dauntless augments Red Winter's brilliant set of infantry rules with an equally thorough set of rules for armor, and the interaction of the two, which roughly double the system's complexity.  Fortunately, the rulebook is well indexed and backed up by detailed examples of each major aspect of play, as well as eight tutorial scenarios.  The glossary is also a big help as the two quasi-independent rule systems (infantry and armor) breed an exceptional number of technical terms.  Having different terminology, and rules, for similar concepts in infantry and armor is annoying, but may be a wise decision at this level of detail as, at this depth, you can't really refactor these two aspects of combined arms into a one-size-fits-all set of rules.  There really are fundamental differences between the four types of combat.  The result is a sophisticated and nuanced combat system, but with as much complexity as any of the 100+ games I've played.  MMP makes similar distinctions between weapons types in their equivalent Grand Tactical Series, but manage to do so with just one combat system.  I prefer MMP's cleaner approach, but you're definitely sacrificing some detail to get there.  The detailed guidance on Operation Dauntless' player aid cards makes up for a lot of the complexity though, so the game plays fairly fast in practice.  Likewise, the big-hex map, which allows one to set up unit swarms instead of stacks, grows on you.  The resultant hex count is about 1/4 of what the map size suggests, but in these grinding bocage fights that is still plenty of real estate.

Another nice feature of Operation Dauntless is the purchase of reinforcements from the higher-echelon's reserve.  This lets you tailor your reinforcements to meet your current needs and tactical plan.

The materials are decent, particularly the robust card-stock player aid and reinforcement cards.  

The bottom line is that this is a great system for working out combined arms tactics, probably more so than the somewhat more streamlined MMP Grand Tactical Series.  If I weren't a steppe person at heart, I'm sure I'd rate the game even higher.

I just got this at a discount at the FLGS. The argument concerning all the manuals in the game is something of a red herring, I believe.

It is clear that there IS a learning curve to this game but to claim that you have to read every document in the game before you can start playing it is simply not the case.

As with so much on BGG, if I'd have taken any notice of any of the comments, I wouldn't have bought this game.

This is a really playable and exciting grand tactical game with some very unique new features. The AT fire rules are a revelation for this level of game. I'm finding it very hard to reconcile the comments about the physical nature of the game with what I'm seeing with my own eyes: everything is clear and easy to use. Scenarios progress quickly. The hex sizes and the stacking rules are a new gold standard in gaming for me. Documentation is very complete. The tutorials are easy to use - I pretty much got the drift without having to complete them, and went on to scenario one after playing three of them - new starters might need more, but the choice is there for you to go at your own pace. There is so much variation and good design in this game, it may well be the best genuinely new game I've seen for a few years.  Lots of the alleged complexity is contained in easy to apply modifiers. 

This just isn't a difficult game in any sense of the word.

  This game requires a big investment of time and energy to learn. But if you stick with it long enough, you're rewarded with a deep, rich, many layered wargame that is fun to play. And on a topic (Brits vs SS) around Caen that is not covered by very many games.

 If you really want to learn this game, my advice is to go through the online tutorials, which make learning the game so much easier.

This is my favorite game.  If you are interested in playing/learning this game, please contact me.  I'm more than happy to help others get into this game and I think you'll find it a lot of fun.  The mechanics are really quite a bit smoother than a read through the rulebook would have you believe.

Very detailed and good look at operations in Normandy that have not been covered by any games before, good to see a game about the British in Normandy.

RATING: 9.5
An excellent, well researched game with a stunning amount of content. 
Rating upped a bit (+0.5) to counter the irresponsible user who gave 5 despite the fact he didn`t even play the game.

GMT P500 item. "The scale is grand tactical- 90 minutes per game turn, 425 yards per hex, and mostly company sized infantry units with platoon sized armor units."

first
I'm a testing player and a researcher
Operation Dauntless it's a great game
if you liked Red Winter will enjoy with OpD
it's a wargame made with love
Mark worked very hard in the rules and the playbook
the addition to the game (if you played RW) are the armored fighting vehicles, more artillery and a lot of other things
upgrade my rating after read the THREE books that will have the game: rules, scenarios and reference book!
update:
after read a user that rate the game with "1"... I m not a family member or friend of the designer so I choose to be the dog!

Playing this was one of the oddest gaming experiences I have had in a while. It is absolutely ubercomplicated for what it is. It does give a Normandie feeling, unfortunately not necessarily making it fun. That pesky 75 mm on a hill will obliterate anything in sight. When you go out attacking in a field you will likewise be sent packing by the ever-present artillery. It gives that feeling. 

At the same time you spend a lot of time trying to understand convoluted rules, die-rolling 10 times in a row to check whether a defender will be suppressed (usually not) and then having a rather random outcome that can blow the front open. It is both magnificent, and totally over the top at the same time. 

It might be that you need to spend some time getting to know the game. Unfortunately, between kids, a hectic job and loads of other games, it is rare that I am able to give a single game 15-20 hours in order to understand what it is all about.

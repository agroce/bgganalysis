pretty fun game. my kids love it and picked it up fairly easy. They laugh at the card art. My daughter thought it should be called munchkin BOOBY lol.  not to many games can be both cooperative and competitive at the same time. I recommend buying a steel shirt to wear with this game because you will get plenty of knives in your back after a couple plays.

RATING: 7
I know the entire Munchkin franchise is a love it or hate it kind of deal, but I can't imagine hating booty. It's light-hearted and cute and fun, and has a really entertaining theme. It's certainly not the highest strategy game that I like, but it's always an enjoyable time, which sometimes appeals to me even more!

RATING: 6
This is classic Munchkin action with pirates. This tends to be a filler game till people show up for whatever activity we have planned because no one cares if we only play this for 30 minutes or 10 minutes. It is definitely not a game I would sit down and play from start to finish, but to kill time till you can get enough people for a real game it works great!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The cards in this version of munchkin are brilliant, the artwork and names are great. However it becomes really easy to become a powerful and virtually unstoppable. The game is extremely unbalanced as there are many strong items and weapons and not enough strong monsters, enhancers and one shots to stop other players. If someone wanted to play munchkin id pick any one over this one.

RATING: 6.5
Enjoyable variation on Munchkin with a fun pirate theme. The usual hero building, back stabbing game play.

Having not played too many munckin games, I don't know if this is a more general problem, but there is no motivation to 'attack' each other until the last round when all hell breaks loose. This can make it feel more like a waiting game for the last 1-2  turns.

I thought I would love Munchkin Pirates, but I'm a little disappointed.  I like the theme, but just don't care for the card interaction in this one.

Doesn't play much different than the other Munchkin titles I own, but this set is particularly hilarious because of the humor on the cards, and perfect for a drunken pirate costume party or 'talk like a pirate' day.

Ugh really?  I am waiting for Munchkin Flux so I can Die the most painful death imaginable!!!

Otherwise known as Munchkin:  Make a bunch of crappy expansions, good for exactly one laugh in a game that should be ten minutes expanded into untold hours of torture wishing that you had the +2 rapier of suicide so you could kill yourself an get it over with all ready!

Said Game will make Steve Jackson Games a bazillion Munchkin Gold pieces off of a really boring, looong, and repetitive game, sold to gamers too brain dead from playing this stupid game to know better than to buy more crappy expansions with the same jokes rehashed over and over and over.

The pirate jokes are fun for a little while, but like the whole Munchkin franchise, it tends to get boring, repetitive and pretty stupid about halfway through the game. Of course, the game will continue on and on after that point. This is a problem with the Munchkin series in general.
An embarrassingly casual game, but if you want a minor to moderate chuckle, enjoy the other Munchkin games, and like pirate jokes, you might enjoy this.

The game is what it is, and I like the inclusion of the Ships and the new rules for them.  Very appropriate and some of them are very funny (Viking Kitties and the Longship).  However, the production quality SUCKS.  The first time I shuffled them they picked up permanent bends.  They are unpleasant to hold and crease far too easily.  If SJ wants to continue to charge $25 for a box of cards, they need to invest in some decent card stock.

One of the better themed Munchkin expansions. It feels closer to the original in theme and play style, and does a good job of playing with the pirate genre.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The one cool addition (sharks - creatures of a certain type that can always be played, a la wandering monsters, with other creatures of the same type) is ruined by a complete lack of interesting cards. What's the point of being able to add a Level 2 Lousy Pink Shark to a Level 6 Lobster Mobster? Munchkin players will know that character power escalates quickly as people churn through the item deck. You never stop a player from winning with a measly level 2 add-on to combat.

The real fun from this expansion is the "accent" cards. I highly recommend a house rule that requires people to speak in their adopted accents when they play the game.

I used to love Munchkin, but the old love died out. The game is still fun, I like the humor, I like to backstab my friends, but you dont have to make many decisions during play. Its a bit of a problem. 

What is more, Im having the feeling that the game offers me too few options to backstab my friends. Any monster buffs I might have are usually not enough to change the fight's outcome, and I dont really get enough of them to be throwing them left and right. The few curses Ive got usually dont harm them all that much. What can I do with a "lose armour" curse when only one out of five players has armor, and he cant even use it, because he's not a Sailor?

The game isnt bad, but its not really my type anymore.

The joke is wearing thin, so I've been dropping the scores of all Munchkin games.
Pirates would seem to be such a great theme for Munchkin, and re-naming races "accents" was sort of clever. But that really is all that's interesting about Munchkin Booty.

Was a gaming café a while ago. Was asked to play a Munchking game (Zombies I think) and realized I really didn't want to do so. So: 5 --> 4.

RATING: 4
I used to love munchkin, but after playing games out there like Red Dragon Inn, Smash Up, and dozens of other card games, it's lost a lot of it's appeal. Munchkin has always suffered from a bit of a Runaway Leader problem, and all too often people win simply by buying their last few levels before fighting a level 1 monster from their hand. Half the time, Munchkin feels like it was designed to be unbalanced as part of it's sense of humor.Unfortunately, the joke doesn't age well.

Reminds me of the Killer Bunnies game. It was pretty fun for the first play. It seems very luck based, though. I guess if you're playing this game, it's strictly for fun and not for strategy.

Munchkin is like D&D, only with 300 percent less D. Level up, ally with others, or screw them over. Positively delightful with the right crowd. Good party game with RPG elements.

Didn't really like it. Or maybe it was just the theme that didn't excite me (that time). So maybe there is a munchkin game (theme) that might get rating of 6 from me.

A great addition to the base Munchkin game that adds variety and extra style. The pirate theme is fun and being able to outfit your ship as well as your character is a fun addition. I still have the same gripe in that I don't feel 10 levels is enough of an experience for a single game. 15 to 20 feels like a more enriching experience. Or perhaps with some house rules for a faster start.

My wife and I always get a kick out of the clever card characters and names.  It makes munchkin exciting every time you play if you have multiple versions.  What we liked about this more than the standard game is the added gameplay features on some of the cards.  This added an extra element to the game and made it fun to play.  Plus, if you can get your wife to play a nerdy card game with the word Booty! on it, you have to appreciate it.  ;)

Bought it on an impulse. I like the way cards add to your attack power and you have levels. The artwork is pretty nice too. It's a fun game, but it's not a game I play often.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
I guess the main problem I have with Munchkin is the basis of the game itself.  It's just random draws from a stack of cards, with no way to prepare for future turns or have any idea what's coming or going.  And games that have a variable ending time really bug me too.

Munchkin with pirates, well there's a plan. I like Booty, it's fine and it's fun to play. It's just not as fun to play as the other versions and therefore gets pushed to the side a lot of the time. Maybe it's just the fact that every character is always human... and no one would adhere to my house rule about having to do the accent on your active accent card.

Good games!

it works perfect! the rules are a bit confusionary, but confusion is the way this game is meant to be ;P

It is funny, fast, enjoyable...

More or less the same game with a different flavor, but the accent/class/monster card distribution seems significantly worse.  I'd rather play regular Munchkin, if only for that reason.

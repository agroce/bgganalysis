RATING: 7
Only played once, I enjoyed it, but it was a bit long for the other players. Bit of rule confusion too on the final scoring rounds which hurt the experience a bit. I'd like to try it again, but haven't had the chance, partially due to the size of the box making it prohibitive for suitcase transport.

There is a nice game there, but it doesn't seem to grab me in any way, it's a long game to play where the options are a bit too obscure and dependant on other players.

Despite rules that need a re-write to be easier to read, there is a reasonable game in here. But if the rules are poorly designed, the game needs to be more inituitive so that you can make progress more quickly.

RATING: N/A
An interesting area majority game with a resource management element thrown in. It also has a nice bidding system with some similarities to New England. The theme is also nicely integrated into the game and doesn't feel tacked on like in many other games. Seems that there are multiple effective routes to victory which is also nice. The only drawback I see is the size of the box!

This is one of my favorite games - but unfortunately I have a hard time getting people to play it.  I wish the rules were better organized and the box was a normal size.  10 rounds is too long.  We play with 8 rounds.

There seem to be two viable strategies: go for points from festivals or linger at the back, gaining influence from moving the fisher god.  It is essential to think about not just your own plays but what others are going to do.  The game is really unforgiving of sub-optimal play.  On the plus side, there are some clever ideas here and the mechanics mesh together very nicely. After each game I've been pondering how I might have played better.  Games I've played have taken 2.5 to 3 hours.  In our last game we took out two cult hexes to shorten the game, with no obvious ill effect.

RATING: 8
Agressive and confrontational, though not in the usual way.  There is a natural cycle of length three, with each player tending to be able to do afford only one part of the cycle each turn, and only if someone else hasn't taken it already.  Breaking out of this requires influence, which is extremely hard to come by.  A game of finesse and of throwing a spanner into the plans of your opponents.

RATING: 8.5
This is a hard game to rate - mainly because the rules make the price of entry painful.  The rules (at least the English translation) are horrid.  It actually takes 1 or 2 plays to get the kinks worked out.  Most gamers will give up long before.  Another detractor is the box size - which is huge only because the board is not quad folded (it is bifolded).  A smaller box and cleaner rules would make this a much better game.  Once you get past those problems, you actually have a really good game.  The economic model is very unique and the tile placement provides a challenging area control mechanic.  The scoring system ensures you must work across several turns.  Overall, this is a top notch game that suffers a barrier to entry.  Give it a try, but by all means get the game taught to you by someone who has played it several times before.

Some interesting ideas and mechanics, but just didn't grab me for some reason.

One time we played with the rules wrong, and considered restarting when we found out, but I just couldn't face it, which explains the rating. Nevertheless, I'd still consider playing again to get a better impression with the rules right.

Played with Dice... will never do so again!  Kaivai is similar to a bunch of Kramer games that I happen to love.  However, in Kaivai the decisions are not only limited, but brutal, which makes for a potentially lousy experience.

You need fish in order to perform the other actions.  If you roll blanks you cannot do anything else.  I found the game boring as hell when I was first in turn order and rolled 3 blanks on fishing.  My whole turn was done.  The next turn I forfeited all of my actions in order to get 2 action chips so that I could attempt to fish again on the following turn.  I like to play games in which there is a backup plan.  Unfortunately, your best move in Kaivai is sometimes to pass and do nothing for 30 minutes.

RATING: 7
The box is ridiculously large, for some reason they decided to produce a board that only bends in half, rather than the usual double fold. For that reason alone I wouldn't buy this, I need to conserve space in my collection! Aside from that the production quality is satisfactory and the game itself is quite enjoyable although not very thematic.

RATING: 8
:d10-4:

We played the diceless variant, which felt a bit fish-rich. Maybe there's a medium ground variant to use, where you get decreasing amounts of fish for additional fisherman in a location. Maybe all boats get one from the first fisherman, one of your boats does not get one form the second fisherman, two do not from the third, and three do not from the fourth.

I had fun with this at 3 players, despite the fact that it's supposed to be best with 4. But I would love to try it with 4 and remembering the rule that fish begin at 5 (not 4).

Initial impressions:

Very impressed with the tradeoffs of points, and the implications therein.

Significantly less impressed with the effects of rolling a single die for fish (multiple fine).  Would likely only repeat with a variant that if you roll a single die (period, not two instances of one die), you get a fish.

Juego descatalogado y nunca editado en españa. Cada jugador lleva una tribu de oceanía, que tiene que expandirse, pescar y obtener puntos de gloria.

Tiene un sistema de elección de acciones muy chulo. Y es que el primero en escoger una acción, paga una influencia (desde la banca) y el resto de jugadores, deben igualar el pago ya realizado en esa acción. Eso le da mucha importancia a ser el primero y escoger bien en qué orden quieres jugar las acciones (la influencia - y todo - escasea mucho en este juego).

Durante el juego se pueden conseguir puntos de gloria con los festivales, que benefician a todos los jugadores presentes en la isla, según la cantidad de pescado que tengan en sus losetas.

En cada turno, lo primero que hace un jugador es "pujar". No se pueden repetir valores, y la puja que se realiza determina la cantidad de movimiento y el precio de las construcciones. Está muy bien equilibrado.

Es un juego con reglas sencillas, pero que tiene mucha, pero que mucha chicha. Una rareza que conocí gracias a Max y que la verdad que me gustó mucho. 

Recomendable para amantes de los euros... y que sean jugones. Es un poco abastracto, así que los que adoran el plástico no lo van a ver bien.

Lovely low-luck brain burner saddled with one of the most dismal English rule translations EVER.  Can get bogged down by AP, and can be really frustrating -- especially if you make a really stupid bidding decision on your last turn and end up not being able to throw a party, robbing yourself of 9 points (not that anybody I know has done this :blush: ) -- because it's a game where EVERY decision matters.

What a grind. A good game can be TOO brain burning which causes it to be not fun. This is one of those games. The economics are too tight. You work way to hard to earn a few measly resources. Then they degrade on you. Way too difficult to get influence markers. Oy.

It reminds me of Antiquity in the sense that the game is designed to be so tough that it sucks any enjoyment out of playing a game.

RATING: 7
Definitely interesting. It's a long game, and you feel at the end that you accomplished little, but fought like hell to accomplish it. The end-game scoring is a lot fiddly, and doesn't really seem to jive with the flow of gameplay (all of a sudden the game becomes area majority when you aren't really thinking about that the entire game). That said, actually trying to balance all of the elements in the game is pretty fun. If this were an hour shorter, it would certainly rate a few points higher.

A strong 8 out of the gate with plenty of room to rise. Most definitely the kind of game I've been enjoying recently - incentives abound, but managed spatially and through turn order and action selection. And hoo-boy are those incentives opaque. I won't be the first to say that the sell/celebrate cycle is gooey deliciousness. Okay, maybe I am the first to say that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
An excellently nasty game with a very pleasant spatial control element.  I especially like the king-making tradeoffs between getting money and giving other players victory points.  Nicely balanced -- pay no attention to the claims that there is only one strategy.  

While highly tactical, there are at least three viable major strategies and probably more.  All of them seem to  start with getting out of phase with the other players as efficiently as possible however.  That's when the fun begins as the game actively conspires to put players back in phase.  

The dice are disappointing and possibly unnecessary.  Certainly the variance of the dice is too large for a game of this weight.  I'm tempted to play with the variant that the one boat is always guaranteed to catch something in every roll (ie treat the last die as if it were all blue).

Beware the player who builds up a mountain of fish (15 or more).

RATING: 9
This is a master clockwork of a game. The whole construct revolves around a series of self-balancing mechanisms: give opponents possible VPs to get money, bid low to get influence or bid high to go first, sink your opponent ships but lose VPs, phasing  out of sequence with your opponents, but phase back in to get a cheap action, and more! Add to this cocktail spatial positioning, blocking, shared incentives, decaying resources  and the need to look ahead several moves and continuously re-evaluate the board and what you have is a top brainburner of a game, if there ever was one. 

Play with the original rules (10 rounds) for full effect, but put aside 3 hours with competent players. On the downside, the dice feel a bit too random, but I haven't tried the diceless variant or the expansion that adds pearls

This is a really great game, a well themed Euro with the elegance and depth of an abstract. Aspiring designers need to study Kaivai, and heavy gamers need to try it. Should be picked for a reprint to give the option to more people to enjoy it

+ Amazing system, full of elegant, novel, masterfully intertwined mechanisms
+ Well balanced, tense and heavily involved all the way
+ Great components
+ Relatively easy to teach

= Strong blocking and screwage
= Requires 3 or (best) 4 competent and analytically strong players
= The catchup mechanism is  left up to the players
= Resistant to analysis, not obvious what to improve upon (but people do improve)

- The box is terribly big and unwieldy
- The rules are a bit cryptic to start with
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Kaivai strikes me as a mix of Big Kini and the K&K action point games with some economic infrastructure building thrown in for good measure. The core of the game revolves around a small pool of actions that allow one to create one thing which can be turned into either money or victory points. This concept is tied with a limited action scheme which makes it very expensive for more than 2 players to take the same action in a round. 

This isn't a bad game by any means, but it didn't really strike me as anything exciting either...I think my mental issue with it is that it doesn't do Big Kini's action tension better, or Mexica's worker placement, or Game X's tile laying scheme, or Game Y's economic planning. It's a conglomeration of average and just didn't stand out for me.

We had some difficulty getting things underway with the Gerglish, Engman, translation I had. So unfortunately this seemed to sour the game a bit. It may not survive but on the car ride back Mark and I gave this game a thorough discussion and the more I think about it the more I like it. I was quite far behind due to deviating from all sound and reasonable strategy in a building type game but I still had a good time. 

This game is one of basically building up your infrastructure and then transitioning to cashing in for victory points.

With ony one game to go on I'm not sure there is more than one or two good strategies but there is plenty of room for good tactics.

RATING: 6
Fantastic production value for a small company, very good design and components. Rules are OK, some parts could be clearer.
During the first hour of gameplay it fells like a rating 8 to 9 (!), howver in our test game we ecountered a serious runnawy leader problem. One player (last on the scoreboard, but already in lead regarding huts etc.) was the one to bit first, and he always bid "1". Then he again and again placed the godness in one of his villages and gained influence tokens. Maybe with a little house rule this could be prevented: do not allow the starting player to choose the same bid (e.g. "one") in the next round. 

See the other reviewers, the same strategie is reported there.

A seemingly middle-of-the-road Euro with somewhat difficult rules.  What you find, after becoming familiar with the system, is that it is a nasty, nasty game of territory acquisition, fighting for fishing rights like centers in the paint wrestling for a rebound, and "helping" other people to death.  Kaivai does not reveal all its beauty on the first playing, nor even on the second.

Brilliant economic development game. Seems to have both a corn strategy and a coffee strategy, there is also a shipping vs. builder approach from focusing on fish points during the game vs. focusing on end of game scoring points.

But beyond that, interesting, complex, and highly competitive board play set this above most economic building games. The amount of development this game went through to get all the various subtle tradeoffs to balance is impressive.

Takes longer than it might.

Played once with expansions.  Ran really really long, but that was partly because of the players and partly because of the expansion adding actions.

Kaiva is essentially about fishing, selling these fish to either your own huts (for potential victory points) or to other people’s huts (for money) and then either throwing parties to scores your (and other people’s huts) or using the money to build more huts of various types. Strategically there is quite a bit going on, with constants struggles as people try to block each other’s ability to gain control of islands and get access to key actions. Being in a lone position where you are able to pursue your goals without obstruction is very powerful, as is the ability to set your huts up to incentivize other players to give you an advantage that is appropriate for that sort of hut. Maneuvering so that you can get in a position to take advantage of these situations is a key part of the game. 

So as you can probably tell, I like the game and am fairly enthusiastic about it.

initial play - It rated a 7
2nd play was better then the first so I bumped the rating to a 7.5. 3rd time bumped to an 8. Likely to stay there.
 

The GOOD
 * lots of good decisions to make. You have to plan ahead and need solid strategic and tactical play to do well.

* I've taken a very different stategy each game and have won all 3

* Looks great and has nice components and only $39 shipped from Europe.

THE BAD

There could be AP issues with more methodical players. There is a lot to be aware of in order to do well.

The UGLY?

3 hours - 3 player, but I think it will stettle in at 2-2.5 with experience. BUT I see no reason why someone looking for a shorter version couldnt play 6 turns instead of the 10 in the rules.

I've only played 3er and I have no idea if it will be quicker or slower with a fourth.

not for the 45 min. light gamer

I have now played 4er and I like it considerably better with 3.

Maybe we played wrong, but we struggled to get this going. It seemed like a desperate grind into poverty. You need Influence chips to get along (the exponential mechanism is great), but they are so hard to get. Turning fish into VPs was okay, but it seemed very hard work to paddle around and build. You can get 2 Influence for doing nothing, and in the 10 rounds that would have been the best option 4 or 5 times! Like I said, maybe we were all wrong, but this was a grind. The rules need a lot of work too.

RATING: 8
Kaivai is another of those games with a very constrained number of actions. There is so much you need to do, yet you only have so little time to do it. The constraining element here is that taking actions is associated with a cost, and the more players already chose an action this turn, the more expensive it becomes. Of course, this means that players who choose actions that they don't necessarily need right now will make them more (and often too) expensive for those who desperately need them.

Proper timing, therefore, is essential and being out-of-phase with everyone else is very beneficial. There is also a delicious trade-off between scoring points yourself and "gifting" points to other players in order to get currency which you need for building new huts.

This is definitely one of those "mean" games. Possible flaws include the use of dice when fishing (it's unlikely, but they can make an entire turn go to waste) and a playing time that feels a bit on the long side.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I felt Kaivai to have all the elements of a game I enjoy.  However, there also was a lot of analysis paralysis that seemed ever present.  This could have been a result of first game syndrome, but it does appear that the actions in Kaivai are very calculational and so with limited turns all players need to really press their ability to function fully effeciently with every go.  I enjoy, as with Puerto Rico, the challenge of positioning ones self out of phase with other players as to make the most gains.  I see Kaivai as a potential ratings climber with more plays.  

UPDATE:  
There is an interesting engine at work here, and everything has a nice symbiosis.  However, it feels that an early mishap can really throw someone out of the running.  Every move has to be thoroughly considered, which can tend to drag the game - especially if it becomes apparent that an earlier move has already left you handicapped.  Then it is an exercise in trying to right a sinking ship, and hoping others at the table make less than optimal moves.  This all benefits multiple plays, as decisions will become quicker with familiarity, and the riddle of efficiency will be a less laborious order.  However, here in lies a problem with the game- finding people to truly commit to learning the system.  Which then gives birth to the inevitable question of is there enough game here to push past the growing pains.  
I want to play again, but my opinion is of less enthusiasm than after my first run with the game.  My wanting to like the game is definitely in battle with my instinct that Kaivai may not meet my standard of marrying complexity to investment of time, and offering the rewards of such a commitment to a game.

UPDATE: Kaivai is a strong game, still not at the top of the tree, but could someday climb there.  Want to play with expansion.

After a 2p learning game, an aborted 3p game, and a full 4p game, my suspicions are that Kaivai is indeed an excellent game of logistics and action management. The comparison to Puerto Rico is apt, but Kaivai is a game with far more entanglements between the players -- both in the physical space of pieces and in the mind space of incentives. All in all, there's much substance here. I can foresee my rating climb.

RATING: 8
Kaivai is an impressive, intricate gamer's game that after several plays appears to be meticulously developed and balanced. Everything in Kaivai works together to create tradeoffs between attractive options. Timing is important above all because those who wait will have to pay an increasingly exorbitant cost to perform an action that another player has already chosen. Players make a bid at the start of each round in the Santiago/New England style. The number chosen governs not only turn order but also building costs, movement distance, and control of the fisherman god. Players then settle the islands, fishing, selling fish to other players, and building three types of cottages all over the board, each of which provides a specific benefit to a player's infrastructure. The geography of the board is used to great effect, creating constant logistical and strategic dilemmas of where to sail, where to build, where to fish, whether to cluster or to spread out, whether to block other boats. Space becomes very tight as the islands grow. Expansion is forced outward to every edge of the board as the cost of building on the major islands grows more and more expensive.

I feel obligated to mention that while I love Kaivai, I've only had about a 50% success rate introducing it to other gamers. Some feel that it moves too slowly or is too repetitive, or that there is too much luck in the dicing for fish, or that it simply lacks excitement. I did play one game which was excruciatingly painful because one of the players was playing at a snail's pace. Kaivai is outstanding as a two-hour game, but not so good as a three-hour game.  Note that there is one very important erratum: the game should be played to 8 rounds, not 10.

This game suffers from bad production design. The game itself doesn't really offer very much new, but it is further hampered by the difficulty in discerning the different huts.

Challenging, yet confusing game of erecting huts, catching & selling fish, holding celebrations and other assorted tasks.  The game appears to have a great deal of depth, but after three playings I just feel too constrained.  Influence chips are difficult to obtain, and this shortage makes it difficult to do much on a turn.  I know others really enjoy it, and I REALLY tried to like it, but it just didn't work for me.

An 8 after the first play.  There is a lot going on here and timing appears to be critical.  More plays needed to settle on a rating.

It's not intuitive and the spatial planning aspects of the game are challenging.  That said, it's really tight and one wrong choice can sink you.  Would love to get this to the table 4 or 5 times in a row with the right group to fully explore it.

I very brutal game.  Influence ends up being VERY hard to come by and therefore it becomes a very unforgiving game very quickly.

I've played this game once, and was impressed (and a little overwhelmed) by the complexity and depth of it.  However, I'm giving it a lower rating and will probably not raise my rating or play it again until one rule is fixed: the influence marker bidding at the end is confusing and probably wrong.  The rules say that if there's a tie, then everybody gets to keep the influence markers that they bid.  So it seems that the player in the lead can force several ties (thus depriving other players of points) using the same influence markers over and over again.  This seems wrong, somehow.

The 4-player game is tight (resource-constrained), and probably is not good for introducing the game to newbies.  There are 6 actions which can be taken for free, and with 4 players, two players can get two free actions.  Also, the last player gets to place the god and extend that island.  So basically, player number 3 gets screwed too easily...

There is so much going on in this game!  Fights for the 6 possible actions, fights for spaces on the board, decisions about whether to deliver fish to others (to give you shells which you can spend to build more buildings) or to yourself (for getting points directly on festivals), decisions about which building to build (add boats? add fishing ability? add extra action generators?), and bidding on top of all that.  And geography matters -- an extra island hex can make things get far apart.  It will take several plays (with 3 players) to get the hang of it, before I can graduate to playing 4 player games.

I had an opportunity to play this twice a BGG.Con and while I enjoyed the game, it overstayed its welcome. Our games took about 3 hours for a game that feels like it should top out at 90 minutes. I enjoyed the escalating cost for actions and the island growth, heck I enjoyed everything about the game except it just felt slow. This may be inherrent in the players as much as the game and would likely speed up with experience but I will probably only get the chance if I pick it up myself.

It took a lot of effort just to get through the rulebook.  It doesn't seem that difficult once you're playing so I guess the rulebook needs a bit of work. Overall, though I like the theme and I think the mechanics definitely have promise but I found the game very tedious. I thought there seemed to be two particular problems (possibly). One is that the person in our game who got behind in building early in the game just couldn't catch up, leaving them obviously well behind before the game was half over. That problem led to the losing player being able to manipulate the village scoring a bit and with two islands to go in final scoring, could have swung the game to either of the opponents (3-player game). Maybe that was just our particular game though. I'm not much looking forward to playing again which is a real shame since I love the fishing theme.

What a nasty little gem this is. The bidding, action phasing, push and pull between immediate actions and future influence, and communal distribution of glory points make for a rich experience. As a bonus the production is quite lovely. A larger publisher would be wise to pick this up.

This is another one of those games that the cogniscenti here on BGG have in my view collectively missed out on.  It's every bit as good as the game that pushed to the #2 slot in just 5-6 weeks last fall, Caylus, but not too many people know about it because those that like the game haven't crowed about it.  To me, the decisions are just as intense as Die Macher -- it has a similar feel to other real brain-burners like Caylus and Reef Encounter.  I would maybe have it higher were it not for some rules ambiguities and poor rulebook organization; also, not getting picked up by a strong US publisher such as Rio Grande or Z-Man is no doubt a factor.  It's a difficult game for many people to grasp, but one I think is worth the time to learn.  NOTE:  Revised rating downward as of October 2007, based on the fact that I have less desire to play this title compared to other more recent games.  Rating is based on less than 10 plays after having owned the game for about 18 months.

Played this twice and enjoy it. There's a bidding aspect that is similar to New England. The tile placement and building selection reminded me of La Citta. Every single available action seems important, but of course you only have limited opportunity to act. I think that with repeated play I might rate this higher.

RATING: 5
An interesting and unique attempt that is fun to play but seems to be missing a little something to push it into greatness.  The method of choosing actions feels fresh and the theme is different enough to not detract.  The box size is ridiculous and the components are passable for a small publishing company.  In all fairness I will need to play this a few more times to pass fair judgment on the game, as I played far from optimally the first time through and it seems like the kind of game that rewards precision and foresight.  The play time makes it more difficult to get to the table, so it seems that it is only worth pulling out if you have 3 players.

Lots of interlocking mechanisms.  Super tight economy.  Just one play, so take this with a grain of salt.  The game was stately in tempo.  Not too much to do when its not your turn.  We gained some speed as we played, though.  Still, some real thoughtful decisions offered.

The game's economy feels almost artifically tight, and some of the mechanisms feel forced. Many times, bidding was a matter of "Player a bids 1, b goes 2, and c goes 3"; it uses the same mechanism as New England, which has a flaw. 

The overall idea was good, but future plays will either redeem this one, or put it on the trade pile.

Update again: Another easy win today but now with a positive approach, not the silly hanging behind strategy. That improves the game, so upgraded.

Update: rating went up after one more play. Played something wrong the first time. First action token in each action field should come from the bank. That makes a lot more sense, it improves the game. A nice economic game of movement and smart play. Quite good. (Then again, in the same time I could play TM, Brass or Age of Steam. All of those are more interesting to play.)

One play. Curious game. Parts I like a lot. But the constant lack of action tokens that are so hard to come by, is strange and annoying. I "sacrificed" (=skipped a complete round in order to get two new action tokens for the next turn) in rounds 2, 4 and 6 and still I won comfortably. Need to play again, rating can go up or down.

I really like the inflation mechanism, and the food spoilage.  We played really badly the first game, and we have come to a couple conclusions: do NOT waste influence markers, they are GOLD.  Buy two fishing idols; it is enough.  Buy LOTS of the communal huts.  Overall pretty good game, although I won by making sure to be the poorest at the end of each round, and with the least points so I could move big fat Black idol and get the influence, leaving my opponents influence-less.  Not sure I like the strategy, and maybe it will never work again- hope so.

Great deep strategy game, lots of angst and difficult decisions. Tons of headwind against the leader, it is definitely best to be last... however if you stay too far behind, it'll be impossible to catch up. It's fun to give points to opponents to receive seashells *and* give them the lead (well, until you loose that is :)) Definitely in the same category as AoS, PoF, and other greats. I found the game maybe 30-60 mins too long, but this will probably be corrected as we gain experience with it. Also some concerns about possible "chesslike" openings, future play will tell

This is a weird little mindfuck of a game. The jockeying for position, the trade off between going early vs going late and how they affect your ship movement and building costs...it's one of those where the rules aren't complex, but sorting out how to play well sure is. It's a gem that I am nowhere near understanding.

I got rid of this because I needed the money and I own too many games; especially games like this one: best with 3-5 players, needs repeated play to get the best experience.

In this game you try to build as many huts as possible(earns VPs) and have the majority of huts in any given island (also earns VPs) of a small archipelago. One of the interesting aspects of the game is that you have to pay by influence tokens for actions already chosen. Influence tokens are hard to come by, therefore you need to plan ahead. There are six different actions to choose from:1: fishing (using boats, to move to an island and with the help of your fishing huts on that island catch fish); 2: building (using boats, to move to islands and than use shell money to build huts there; there are three different kind of huts that can help in catching fish(fishing hut), getting influence tokens(gathering hut) or introduce more boats(boatbuilder hut) which give you more actions later); 3: selling (using boats to move next to huts and sell fish to these huts - selling to opponents huts earns shell money immediately, while selling to own huts will later earn VPs when the celebrating action is used on the island where the fish was sold); 4: moving (helps boats move around the board and also an opportunity to sink opponents boats by sacrificing VPs); 5: celebrating (consuming fish sold to the huts on an island and earning VPs to hut owners and extra VPs to the player who chose the action); 6: upgrading extra boat movement ability (increases boat movement range permanently). Actions are executed in turn order, that is decided by a once around auction. Bidding turn order is decided by position in VP track, the player at the back makes the first bid. The highest bidder will chose an action first. Higher bid value means higher building cost - regular boat movement allowance is lowest at low and high bid values. The lowest bidder moves a god figure to a different island, where it can help in the fishing action and getting influence tokens (players with gathering huts already on that island or players building gathering huts there will earn influence tokens).
The game lasts 8 rounds that takes about 2 hours to complete (more with AP players). Timing the actions right, making use of the bidding mechanism to influence turn order favorably and using your hard earned influence markers wisely makes the difference between winning and loosing.

Criminally underrated gem. This game is easily a top 20 game, yet it is currently ranked 1,956 on BGG. That says a lot about how useful the rankings are. 

Very tight game that can be harsh. Every action choice must be carefully thought about. Games are usually very close. The only way you can earn money is by giving other people victory points, so difficult decisions must be made with every move.

Wow, talk about absurdly underrated game! 

I need to play this more often. Wait, I'll rephrase: I need to play this everyday, because this is one of the deepest, most complex, interesting and intriguing games I haver ever played. In fact, this is so deep and complex that it scared some of my regular playing partners away. Someone once described it as puerto rico with a board, but I think it's much more than that. Positional play is important, timing is very important (in fact, I think that staying out of phase with the other players is the most crucial aspect of the game) and there's plenty of room for strategy and tactics. And the components are great.All of this to say that Kaivai is a really complex and engaging economic game. A game like no other and one of the best in my collection. I need to play more, but I can only see the rating go up from here.

There are a lot of good things in this game.  Just trying to manipulate your empire for maximum gain is good, but then throw in the weird geography of it, and it gets mind-bendingly complicated.  The rules aren't very intuitive, so you really do seem to spend most of your time figuring out how to manipulate them to your advantage, rather than just trying to find the best play.

It also took way too long, but that might just be an effect of the group I was playing with.  If it could be played in two or three hours (say, the length of a game of Age of Steam) my rating would go up.

First impressions after 1 play.  Very tight game economically and the tight currencies include: fish, shells, influence, glory(vp), actions and boats. Not all of these are strictly currencies, but you feel the squeeze in all areas and you need to convert from one to another as efficiently as possible.  A very fun game.  Definitely took a few turns to see the level of squeeze in the different commodities. A bit of head wind against the player in the lead 'on the score track'.  Looking forward to playing again.

I ask you, gentlegeeks.  How can anyone not be delighted by a game that so thoroughly evokes Thorstein Veblen's notion of conspicuous consumption? If there is ever a re-themed modernized version of Kaivai, I feel the designers would do well to preserve the game's essential emphasis on in-group social status, though they may have to deliberate over how to update the the role of the palm-frond cottages, cult statues, and fish-gorging hoedowns--perhaps replacing them with equally tribal concepts such as time-share condos, mega-churches, and attendance at Alan Moon's Gathering of Friends.

Feels like there's some game there, but it doesn't come out on the first playing. We played one rule wrong for two games, but I think we're also playing with the wrong strategy. (People bid 1 to place the god, but then can't do any actions because they're the 3rd to pick and can't move their boats very far. Everyone is playing a turn out with fish,deliver,party so the first player get a free crack at each. If players were on different cycles and had the philosophy that you really only do one a turn, then people would get an action each instead of the first player doing all three every turn.)

A very interesting game. Tough decisions to be made throughout the game. Love the turn order thing going on with this one. 

UPDATE: I've got to play this game 3 times now and each and every time I'm interested in the game about to the half way point. Then I'm no longer interested. I've never played with the 8 rounds option nor with the expansion which to me seems like it would be a perfect fix for the game but as I've only played the base game my rating is for that...and as of this writing I'm lowering that rating to fit my feelings for what I've played.

Really impressed with this. Smooth-playing, simple economic game on a shared map that players gradually define and develop.

The auction is quite clever and as a would-be game designer my mind is flooded with the possibilities of this mechanic. Namely, you pick a number 1-10, and that number determines play order (earlier in order being typically best, but lowest bid gets a special perk), building cost, and base canoe movement allowance. In this "auction" each player must select a different value, Santiago style. No one pays anything (though this abstract value will correspond directly to the building cost, if that player chooses to build anything).

The bundling of effects with the bid value is correlated (earlier in turn order always pays more to build, and the middle bid values have the best canoe movement), which I suppose is the "new" and elegant thing for me, since it wouldn't surprise me in a game to see draftable positions in turn order bundled with, say, some draftable, randomly drawn cards. The other thing about that though, is that randomly drawn cards would have no guarantee of balance. Kaivai's system is both balanced (in a sense) and simple, not even requiring a bidding currency.

The economic system involves fishing to get fish, selling them to the other players for shells (from the bank), spending shells to put new hut hexes in your color on the board, and "celebrating" (eating fish your huts have obtained) to get VP. The low bidder each turn also gets to move the fisherman god to a new island, which will then grow by a hex, be better for fishing on that turn, and also give "influence counters" to those who have "meeting huts" on that island. (There are meeting huts, fishing huts, and canoe-building huts. Meeting and canoe-building can be sold fish.) The influence counters are used essentially to use worker placement spots that have already been used on that turn.

Luck is low (some uncertainty from rolling dice to see how many fish you catch) and consequences to almost every decision go very deep if you try to analyze them. This could bring out AP in people. The map is coarse: It matters where you build things and how much canoe movement your bid will allow you. Fish gradually go bad and you'll get more for them if you sell to huts that don't have any. Shells gradually lose value also. Fishing huts are more effective if built on the same island, but if you group them on one island you'll want to be sure your canoes can easily congregate there.

The economy is tight. In order to build a lot of huts (which is key to end-of-game VPs) you need shells, so you need fish, so you need canoes and fisherman. But you also need influence counters in order to take a lot of actions, so you need to build meeting huts. I find it interesting how difficult it seems to be to evaluate the value of influence counters vs. shells or fish.

One thing that kind of bothered me on a first play is that the VPs scored during the game (from eating fish that have been sold to your huts) seem largely drowned out by the end-of-game scoring which is based on total huts built and having majority presence on islands (scoring then according to island size). Obviously if you keep this fact in mind while playing it will be clear that VPs from celebrations are not the "be-all, end-all" of the game. But, I'm not sure I understand why it's better for the game to, as it eventually turns out, be an area majority affair instead of letting the celebrations be as key to the game as they initially seem. Maybe it makes the game more strategic.

I should also confess that at times I found it displeasing to evaluate my bidding options. I felt I could mostly quite accurately estimate where I needed to go in turn order and how much canoe movement I should allow myself, but occasionally some deep thought really turns out to be warranted, to avoid messing up your turn.

Make sure to play by the first edition rules, and with exactly four players. Kaivai has all of my favorite qualities in games: spatial positioning and movement, incentive management, a compelling auction for turn order, highly interactive with a dose of screwage. Every time I play this I enjoy myself thoroughly. There are broadly speaking three distinct strategies, but really the focus is on getting out of phase with your opponents, as every time the same action gets taken in a round it becomes more expensive. Not nearly as easy as it sounds though- currency deflation at the end of the round creates an incentive for players to effectively get back into phase with each other. Just an overall fascinating, thrilling, brutally interactive experience; the luck of the dice is the glaring flaw but it's by no means a deal breaker.

Quite a hard game to do well at, not bad but again, not good enough (for me) to warrant several plays.

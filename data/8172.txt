[ESP] No podras para de reir en este juego en que los jugadores se convierten en indios. Cada uno se pone una pluma con un numero en la cinta que llevan en la frente. Se trata de adivinar la suma de los numeros de todas las plumas. Pero solo se pueden ver las plumas de los otros y no la propia. Quien adivine y fanfarronee mejor puede nombrarse cacique y organiza el proximo Pow Wow.

Rating based on two games, including one 9-player game (with fancy expansion, i.e. piece of elastic).  Definitely math-heavy, but quite silly as well.  Has player elimination, but the game plays quickly enough that I haven't found it to be a big deal.

Just had to buy two sets of this game, so as to engage
up to 12 people at a time. Recommend minimum 4 players
and Maximum 8 players. Houseruled ,so that the game is over once somebody has 3 tomahawks in front of them.
This was a real hoot and a howl to play. Love push Your
luck style games and can see this replacing Liar`s dice. One really wishes one had extendable eyeballs while playing this game ,since the anguish of not knowing what feather number you have is excrutiating. FUN-FUN-FUN for
the whole family.

Really is just like a reversed Liar's Dice, as everyone says.  It's nice to have a light game that will accommodate a bunch of people that's not annoying.  This is sure to guarantee a few laughs, but I would try to avoid AP-types.  I guess it is possible to mathematically scrutinize everyone's guesses, though you would have to cut through the bluffs, but where's the fun in that?  I prefer the Pow Wow version, since it can accommodate 8 players.

Having played both Coyote and Pow Wow, I very much prefer the Pow Wow edition by Ravensburger.  Also, Pow Wow plays up to eight players.  This seems very silly and has some card luck to it, but it does have a good deal of bluffing skills to it.  It reminds me a lot of Liars Dice/Perudo but with card randomness instead of dice, so you must deduce the probabilities of whether someone's best guess is on the spot with regards to knowing what the deck of cards consists of (and whether the card has been used or not).  It's also possible to use two copies of the game for up to 12 players.

Fun game that non-gamers and children particularly enjoy.  Of course, the very high powerful make the game chaotic, but it should generally be possible to determine if you have a very powerful card on your head from the other people's bids.

Coyote is a bluff game with many similarities to Perudo (Liar's dice). But it's a little easier, has a little more luck and is a lot more funny to look at from a spectator point-of-view. If you feel more like a serious gamer try Perudo, if you're more of a party gamer and you don't mind looking silly, try Coyote instead. It's also a great game for kids learning to count.

Fun and easy party game. A good filler for an evening with friends
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is a light bidding game wherein players are each given a card (ranging in value from -20 to 20), and they must guess what the sum of all the cards around the table is.  However, while each person can see everyone else's card, they cannot see their own card, making guessing the total challenging.  On their turn a person can either say that they believe the prior person's guess is too high, or guess a new total (increasing the prior person's guess).  Anyone who gets caught guessing wrong three times is eliminated; the last player standing wins.  

This is a light game that has just enough unknown information to make it challenging.  The main problem I see with it is that you're always questioning the guess of your neighbors, and thus don't have as much player interaction as would be possible (and if the person next to you is much better or worse than you at the game, it could lead to frustration).

[Update: I've now played this more, and am liking it more each time. First, it's a fun casual game that takes six which requires player interaction, making it a great start to a gaming session.  Second, there is enough known information to make tactical decisions / strategic choices possible.]

Very quick filler that isn't much fun if you play competitively in a large group. If the first player makes an honest guess, it is a bit too easy for the 2nd player to screw over the 3rd. The blue feathers do throw things off so that is not always the case.

Upping from 5, because powwow. Still, a bit too much information means perfect bids with high certainty are not uncommon. And I miss that gambling aspect you get with liar's dice.

First impression (4 players): An indian poker style game where you must name the sum of numbers everyone is holding but you don't get to see your own number. Most cards are 1-5 but since there are -5, -10, +15, +20 and some special cards it is more about not drawing the one that makes huge swing than real deducting. Not a serious game but if you enjoy bluffing & doublequessing at least with 4 players it was pretty fun.

Veloce e spassosissimo party game di carte, aumenta il divertimento con l'aumentare del numero di giocatori. Intuito e fortuna la fanno da padrone ma provare a governare e risolvere il gioco è alla base del divertimento. Regolamento che si spiega in un minuto questo aiuta a rendere il gioco perfetto per momenti spensierati e serate in compagnia. L'eliminazione dei giocatori è l'unico difetto che trovo a questi filler/party game che fa bene il suo compitino.

B&P at its best! The author has taken a simple idea, drew some nice images, printed them on cards and WE play! ;)
Update (12.09.16): We played this again after a few years. It might be that our gaming group evolved to much over the years, but this isn't fun anymore. I lower my rating.

Lots of laughs both for the game itself and for the fact that people make funny faces when trying to both add up numbers and figure out what they have. Cool for families and for a late night game.

Great game.  I like Code 777 and What's That on My Head, but this could be the best of the lot because it's much quicker than 777 and much more fun than WTOMH.

A euro version of Indian Poker.  More fun, but not by much.  However, there's still some good game theory to be done based on people's estimates of safe bids.

This seems more gimmicky to me than gamey, but not in a good way.  Still there is fun to be had in this light guess fest of what's on your head.  Kid's will definately like this one.

Great Party Game. So easy and so funny. Really entertaining.
Light game, for everyone to play.
I have to rate it an 8, it's not my kind of game, but it's designed for a purpose and does it very well.
I will always play this Game, after a Heavier Game, to end the night with a smile.

A very good party game, take your indian bandana, place a feather with a number on your forehead and try to figure out what is the total summ between all the players, but BEWARE, answer wrong and get an axe in your head. :D

Coyote is proof that games need not be deep or complex to be fun.  It's really just a party game to which, if you want, you can apply a bit of strategic thinking and bluffing.

The game is very chaotic with a large player count but as players are taking out of the game it becomes a very tense bluffing game. Which is weird for a game with putting feathers with numbers on your forehead.

The deck has numbers, mostly low, some negative, some high (10, 15, 20), and some specials (2x, cancel highest, etc). Without looking, draw one and put it on your head. Then bet about sum of all cards. In turn, raise sum or call. If called, loser gets a chip stuck to your headband; 3 marks and you're out. Last one in wins!It's the essence of Liar's Dice, plus you get a goofy headband!

Only suitable when you're feeling very silly or drunk, or both, or just want to make a fool of yourself. As far as part games go, I can think of better alternatives.

RATING: 3
Not my cup of tea.  The business about wearing your card on a headband where you can't see it is amusing but doesn't make this progressive guess-and-chicken-out exercise something I want to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The game reminds me of Perudo but is more relaxed and more fun. There is player elimination but everybody tends to be eliminated around the same time so it's not too bad. Counting is a little bit difficult and needs to be explained to everybody before you start. You can combine two copies of the game in order to play with more players.

I got my self a copy o Pow Wow (more players better componnents...)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Played 3+ times.  It's just silly and fun.  It's crazier than liars dice because of the "x2" and "-10" and as a result it's more of a crazy party game, but still intense.  Lots of bluff and meta game, plus you get to wear a bandanna and put feathers in your hair.  Who can resist, not me. 2006/12/14 (Julia's)

Entirely unfair and swingy based on the card you draw, but I'm almost willing to forgive it this as it really is just stupid fun.

The 'power up' cards add an unnecessary extra layer of rules though.

This variant of Indian Poker (you know, put the card on your head, everyone bets who has the best 'hand' despite seeing everyone's hand but their own) can be fun, but I never feel like taking it out.  Probably good with liberal doses of alcohol.

Fun game. Our group likes to play Liar's Dice a lot as an end of the night filler. This game offers a nice alternative to that.

RATING: 8
Very good game. This made me laugh more than any game I've played since Apples to Apples. I imagine with repeated play the novelty may wear off, but so far it's been FUN! 8-15-04 update: not as funny as it was at first, but still a solid game. Initial rating unchanged. Nongamers really enjoy it, which is always a plus.

:star: provokes laughter quite quickly
:star: the physical aspect of the game - headbands, feathers and tomahawks - is fun

:nostar: the box isn't the most practical space for storage
:nostar: only goes to 6 people - not very much for a party game
:nostar: requires houserules for the case where the first player thinks the total is below 0

Coyote is a simple bluffing game in a western setting. Every player gets a card (bound on his forehead by a fabric tape) showing a number of "hidden" Indians or a special value. You don't know the value of your card, but you can see all the others. The object of the game is to guess how many Indians are shown on the cards, declaring an increasing number every turn. If you are caught over declaring, you lose.
\13\\13\
Many special cards make every game turn a surprise, and don't forget you never know the card you are showing on your forehead.

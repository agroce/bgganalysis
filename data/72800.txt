Amazing toy factor. This is just like Bisikle with one great improvement - the cars that you place to hold your spot have ramps on the back, allowing you to jump your opponents.

RATING: 9
We don't usually play with the cars. We find that it makes the game less fiddly, faster and more enjoyable without them (we use multiple colored Z-Balls). 

There is a lot finesse and skill involved in this game. This is the only dexterity game that I can think of that is actually fun to play around with on your own. (Can I complete the track in 7 flicks?)

This game definitely fired PitchCar.

Pretty good flicking game.  Between this and PitchCar, I think this is slightly better.  The play is very similar, obviously, but Z-Ball is and the ability to "jump" other cars makes the game different.

The big difference between the two, however, is the the setup and takedown.  The Roadzters track is so much quicker to setup, lays flater once assembled, and most importantly, the rails stay put.  Gameplay aside, that makes me prefer this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Really the only difference here between Bisikle and Roadzters is the vehicles. The cars have ramps and appear designed to stay in place even when whacked by the ball. A nicer design aesthetic, but you don't have to worry about avoiding other competitors as much, which is part of the fun of Bisikle. I dunno. I was a somewhat disappointed this wasn't a little more different from Bisikle, but it seems OK. Not sure I need this, plus PitchCar, plus PitchCar Mini, plus Bisikle. But I have them all anyway.

RATING: 3
Arguably more skill involved than Pitchcar, but sadly just comes off as a fiddlier, inferior version of said game. The 'jump' hazard is nearly impossible to get past without flicking the ball clean into the next room, and leaping over cars (meant to be encouraged by their sloped backs) is equally impractical.

A sort of Pitchcar with plastic instead of wood components.  (The track is basically identical to what you'd find in a cheap slot car set, minus the slots.)  And, of course the "Z-Ball."  It's rather tricky to get the hang of, but has the potential to be more interesting than Pitchar's simple flicking.

UPDATE: Played a game with my 5-year-old and some adult friends.  It's definitely much tougher than PitchCar at first -- including a child who enjoyed chasing the ball when it went flying off the table turned out to be very helpful.  Reactions were basically dependent on one's opinion of dexterity games in general, I think.  Hopefully we'll figure it out before it gets frustrating.

This game takes up less space than Pitchcar which is a huge plus. Flicking the zball also feels better than the discs. All in all great game.

RATING: 5
Generally it could be said that I love flicking games.  And some parts of Roadzters are top notch or at least founded on good ideas.  The pylons that fit snugly into slots under the roads, for instance, are a fantastic idea.  The fact that two of them (the number available for most configurations) don't actually lift the road high enough to clear the ball is typical of how the game falls apart.  The zball itself, while theoretically a marvelous bit of engineering, turns out to be stupidly hard to control (for beginners, apparently).  Send it around a curve quickly, and the resulting spinning motion is almost guaranteed to send it off the track.  This is not the case with wooden discs, ala Pitchcar.  All in all, I'm sad that I bought the game.

RATING: 4
This tries to imitate Pitchcar by using a ball instead of wooden disks, and it fails to produce to same experience.  Why? Because the main selling point of this game, THE Z-BALL, is not as nice as the wooden disks. Even with the ball bearings inside it, it doesn't have the weight to make it feel like my flick is going to be skill based. Everyone just flicks it around the track and hopes it doesn't roll off the track. Yes, it is possible to "curve" the z-ball, but this takes far too much practice for what should be a "flick-and-go" game.  On top of this, the game only comes with one z-ball, causing for unnecessary fidliness as everyone must move their cars around after each flick. FURTHERMORE, the game is only 4 players.  Really? Give me Pitchcar any day over this.

More than likely this will be my highest rated previously owned game. It is the only dexterity game I have owned/played. When we played we had lots of fun, but it was a chore to get the box down and set up on the floor (small London flat = small table space), and you're not always in the mood for crawling around on the floor. Also, the type of dexterity needed was something you could get with regular practice but we never played it often enough to get much better, and the massive box sat unplayed for ages taking up precious shelf space. If I had a dedicated area to set this up it would be a keeper for sure. Sorely disappointed we didn't get to play it more.

I like this better than Pitch Car because it is less expensive, much easier to assemble (especially the rails), stays together better during play, takes up less room on the shelf, and weighs a whole lot less.  

I first purchased Bisikle and then sold Pitch Car.  Next I purchased Roadzters because all the parts are interchangable, and because the back-end ramps on the cars sounded intriguing.  The ramps, however, are hard to use and rarely result in a successful ball jump.

In Roadzters, there are examples of track designs, but for some of elevated & more curvy designs, there are not enough posts or rails provided.  If you are going to buy extra rails, posts, jumps, etc., for either of the games (Roadzters & Bisikle), you might consider buying both games instead, because as mentioned, all parts are completely interchangeable. 

There are a lot of people with whom I game, who like this type of dexterity racing game, but I don't really appreciate it as they do.  I let them bring it out, I don't suggest it.

RATING: 8
A fun flicker of a game.  That is, one flicks the ball along the road track to advance one's pawn in this Racing Themed Game.  The ball is hollow with loose weights inside. With practice it is possible to get the ball to follow the track as it makes a 180 degree curve. I have seen a billiard ball make an S shaped curve but have yet to figure out how it was done or how to get the Z-Ball to make such a maneuver. If anyone knows how to do either I'd like to learn how.  The components of this game are compatible with Bisikle.

Ok, we did have plenty of fun with this. The components are cheaply made and the rule translation seems to be computer-based or something, on the edge of legibilty (with some parts apparently belonging with Bisikle, as they make no sense for this one). But the game is fun indeed - yet not sufficiently different from Carabande to keep both. If the components were of better material, I might have been convinced to keep it, but there is too much fiddling around during play, especially with bridges (which are most fun, otherwise). It's a pity, as the actual track tiles work excellently and fit together much more smoothly than the Carabande ones. But a somewhat more professional approach to the rest of the materials would have been appreciated.

A little disappointing thus far.

It doesn't even come close to measuring up to PitchCar, that's for sure.  The ball has a lot of action to it, making great shots very difficult.  A lot of "crawling" around the track, any chance-taking results in crashing.

The track pieces snap in nicely, making for a sturdy track surface.  It could have used more rails, but then that might make the game too easy.

I dunno...I'd just MUCH rather play PitchCar, all things considered...

This product is topnotch compared to Pitchcar.  The track fits together nicely with no seams sticking up.  The rails easy to install.  The Z-Ball makes the flicking much more enjoyable than using Pitchcar's wooden pucks.  Sold Pitchcar after trying this out.

If priced right this is a musthave for me (related to bisikle).

Edit I scored it at 7. I got this and bisikle for a big track.
It's good for a couple of laughs. I'm really impressed with the track.

The z-ball is predictable in its movement.  

Rerated it to a 6 because I don't see myself pulling this out.

I just got this game and was so excited.  I like pitch car but feel that if the track is even slightly off, the chips have lots of problems.  So the zball seems like the answer.  The problem is the rules SUCK.  Yes it should be a simple game, but there are scenarios that come up where it is confusing where to put your car.  For example the bridge or if you don't clear the ramp etc.  I will improve my rating I'm sure once I get that figured out, but the rules in the box are not good,

A bit better than Bisikles because of the better game peaces (cars won't knock out), but otherwise very much a same game. One of these games which I'm ready to play every now and then, but I don't see any reason why should I own it myself -> which why I gave my game for the better home.

Played once, 4 players.  Very tentative rating.  This is NOT a childrens dexterity game.  My first game was all about waiting for space in a hairpin curve.  Cars easily bunched up too tightly to reasonably move further.  I'm  also a bit disappointed with my progress at playing this game.  I would've thought after the practice I've had (about 2 hours), I would be better able to control the Z-ball, but I find it is beyond my capabilities.  It does have some cool effects you won't find in PitchCar, but PitchCar pucks are much eaiser to flick where you generally want them.

This game uses the zball mechanism created for Bisikle (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/55165/bisikle)

It apparently takes pitchcar up a notch in the dexterity department. BUT Pitchcar is quicker to set up and more straightforward to play. Very old school as compared to Bisikle and Roadzters (or so it seems).

The biggest selling point is how cheap it is compared to Pitchcar.

Pieces look crappy and cheap, plus set up looks more laborious. YET, Tom Vasel says it's really fun to play and perhaps this just needs to be experienced before a final determination can be made.

Pitchcar was a flop for us, so the only logical step is to get yet another flicking race game... But it worked! Changing the disks to a crazy, weighed ball did the magic. Instead of flicking a disk randomly and hoping for the best, you can actually control the ball here, and the game is much more smoother and more fun. As an added extra, there's everything you need is in the base box. You don't need several expansions just to get ramps and tunnels, and more importantly, the segments fit almost seamlessly, so no frustration from uneven connections. Pretty much the best in its genre.

Entertaining dexterity game. Putting spin on the ball is where it's at.

Very similar game to Pitch Car, but it takes a lot more skill to control the Z-ball. The high grip Z-ball is easier to control, so that can be used by the players who are not as skilled to make it more even. Too bad the tracks/rails are not compatible with Pitch Car as they work much better than the Pitch Car ones. The plastic parts snap together really well, but come out easily enough after the game is over.

Cars vs. bikes - I don't actually care. I got one of each.

Below is what I said about Bisikle. The same apples to Roadzters.


3 reasons Bisikle is better than Pitchcar:

1) flicking a ball rather than a disc means the track does not have to be perfectly smooth.  In Pitchcar slightly warped pieces created seams.  Also the Bisikle track pieces fit perfectly.

2) The Z-ball allows for more control than a wooden disc.  There is definitely more skill involved in Bisikle.

3) Bisikle is MUCH cheaper than Pitchcar.  You can buy two copies of Bisikle with a huge amount of track and stunt pieces and 8 bicycles for significantly less than Pitchcar.

The only advantage Pitchcar has over Bisikle is that it is easier for kids to play, which does matter to me, but does not outweigh all of the disadvantages.

Update: I wish I could control the ball better. I am sure it would get more play if it were easier to control.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 1

I love it! It's much harder than I thought it would be, but trying to master the Z-Ball is a lot of (frustrating)fun! I used to have PitchCar, and it was very easy for me. I like this much better! These tracks stay together way better and don't have any raised edges where they meet. Also, the way the rails pop on and off is so much better than having to hot glue the ones that come with PitchCar.

RoadZters is a flicking game, very much like Bisikle, also from CEPIA Games. The whole concept is in the ZBall, a marble with a unique internal mechanism. Very easy to control, you can spin it in different ways to do high precision shots. The goal of the game is to flick your way to the finish line as fast as possible. Players have to compete on a 13ft track with obstacles in order to win the car race - but if you fall off track, you lose your turn! No cards or electrical devices are involved.
\13\\13\
In RoadZters, the cars are also jumping ramps - so be bold and use your opponents to fly past them! The challenge is to control the effects of the ZBall and show a lot of self-control in challenges (slopes, fences, jumps, mouseholes, etc.). Will you manage to deal with pressure?

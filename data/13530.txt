Quick fun game, roughly about 20 mins play.
works well between 2-5 players.

Dont be put off by the pizza theme!

Really like a play mechanic in this game.

Basically the same game as "Mamma Mia" but with different pizza's.  Can be combined to create a mega pizza game.

{1 play, 4 player} It was neat to see some new pizzas, and the ask-for-help thing was okay, but ultimately this is no improvement on the original for me.  We didn't play the BIG combined game, so maybe that's worth it, and I think if I played this again, I'd suggest a Wyatt Earp-ish variant wherein you can choose direction to ask for help.  In our game the player to my left was the leader, making it tough for me to even consider asking.

As a stand alone game, I find this less enjoyable than the more basic Mama Mia.  The unusual pizza orders add a layer of complexity but do not really add to the game play.  The ability to request help from the other players has a distinct feel of a house rule.  In contrast to this, when Sole Mio is combined with Mama Mia for the Grande version - the additional ingredient cards and pizza orders work.  The combined game takes a bit too long but is still enjoyable.  Rating reflects the stand-alone game play only.

RATING: 6.5
This is a refreshing addition to Mamma Mia, but the kids and I think that two rounds is too few, as is the number of ingredient cards for two players.  There are three more order cards in this game than there are in the base game, so you would think that more ingredients would be needed.  To counter this, players can help one another make orders, but this doesn't seem to be enough of a balance.  I like it, but we'll probably tweak it a bit to suit our tastes.

Mamma Mia! was a great, if somewhat limited game; Sole Mio! is just awful. Some of the pizzas you are trying to make are perverse, and the game commits the cardinal sin (for a lightly-themed game) of greatly increasing complexity and randomness at the same time. Mamma Mia! is just not that sort of a game. Not recommended.

Along with Mamma Mia, I find this game almost irritatingly light...it's inoffensive and I don't mind the luck or memory elements, but I also don't find it terribly interesting.  I think it'd be a big hit with children and families with children though, and I'm glad it's out there for them if not me.

This rating is actually for Mamma Mia Grande, the variant given in the rules for Sole Mio! that combines the two games (Mamma Mia! and Sole Mio!).  I love the additional complexity and the different options.  I rate Sole Mio! slightly lower than Mamma Mia Grande and slightly higher than Mamma Mia! (which I rate an 8).  My main disgruntlement with Sole Mio! is that the rules have it only last two rounds.  Going back to three rounds with Mamma Mia Grande, but forcing unfilled orders to be removed from the game, is just right.

Take 1 Mamma Mia. Gently grate away the streamlined receipes. Mix in double ingredients and add new weird and complex receipes. Water down with new partnership rules. At least the chef looks a lot better.
(Actually the partnership rules are good for taking the hard edge of the memory aspect and making it a more casual game. Useful for when you're in a more casual mood.)

A sister game to Mamma Mia.  Players are playing ingredients from their hand into a comoon discard pile, optionally followed by a pizza order that requires different combinations of ingredients.  The discard deck is eventually run through in reverse order and pizzas try to be completed.  Players can add ingredients from their hands, and now in this version request help from their opponents!  The reward for giving aid is the completion of one pizza order.  I liked this version a lot, possibly more than Mamma Mia.  Note, the two sets can be combined for a "grande" version of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Sequel to Mamma Mia.  I prefer the simpler gameplay of the original, but the new pizzas & double ingredients feel like a slight improvement.  I have both, so one day I could try the combined "Super Mamma Mia Grande" sometime.  Grade: C
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
played once. i've never played mamma mia, so i can't compare, but i can't imagine it does anything better than this one.  players throw ingredients down and then cards that use said ingredients. the "game" consists of card counting.  that's it. just remember what in the discard pile isn't being used, and you're set.  if you LIKE card counting.

if people like this game, maybe they'll like my new card game called Reverse Polish Notation.

A slightly more complicated version of Mammia Mia that can be played standalone, or with Mamma Mia as well.  It takes it up a notch for the better in my opinion.  There are 11 interesting pizza orders to choose from instead of 8 in this version.  It plays much better with 2 players than Mamma Mia.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Pretty much the same game as Mamma Mia with a few minor tweaks. In particular, the new recipes are somewhat less straight-forward and a little wackier than I'd like. I suppose it's nice to have a little something extra when you've played out Mamma Mia, though.

Acquired in 2005. Total number of plays is 13. Sole Mio is a nice diversion if you want more variety in your pizzas. I find the game a bit too chaotic, although the rule about being able to ask and receive help in filling your orders adds an interesting strategic element not present in Mamma Mia.

You can't eat the pizzas, which is the only reason this game doesn't get a 10 from me. But on the bright side, they used regular cards, not pizza-smelling cards, so I don't pull this game out and get given false expactations of pizza.

RATING: 8
Basic mechanics are same as with Mamma mia. In Sole Mio there are double ingrediments and more pizzas. In general the pizza orders are more complicated and not so easy to understand as in basic game. The biggest difference between the two games is the rule where you can ask help from other players to complete one of your orders. I was a bit sceptical about it before the game but it worked well and makes game more social. I think the rule works best with 5 players. It also makes the game a more unpredictable because you really cannot know what pizzas will fail and what won't. Like Mamma Mia the Sole Mio is a very good and fun filler. I prefer Mamma Mia's more straightforward pizza orders. Some elegancy of the game is lost with too complicated pizzas.

I perhaps like Sole Mio best when combining it with Mamma Mia to great Mamma Mia Grande (where you use all the pizzas from both games. For this you need to experienced players of both games.

A fun stand alone card game or can be combined with Mamma Mia. If you play it as is then you will be playing with all new pizza combos. The mechanics of Sole Mio and Mamma Mia are wonderful with a new twist on Memory. As an adult, I do not like Memory games too much, but this one works for me. Even if you forget what's in the ingredient deck you can throw a pizza in just for kicks...to see if you can make it or screw over your opponents pizza making intentions.

After one play.  I played this as a stand alone game, although it can be combined with Mamma Mia!  The orders are more complex, and some of them are a little far-fetched and require your opponent to play a card.  I could have done without those orders.  I did like the fact that there were so many orders, and in my opinion less overall ingredients so it made the game tighter.  I didn't even see all of my menus during the game.

RATING: 8.1
nice filler game that plays quick.   Interesting light decisions such as planning the right time to play your orders and weighing to press your luck that you'll have something to play from our hand during the fill order phase.  This is the same mechanics as Mamma Mia but has different order cards which as quite a bit more involved.  These order cards also promote a little more player interaction and give an additional purpose for the sole mio card.

Memory + luck of the draw + no ability to predict other players' moves + lots of rules to remember for how different cards score = not much fun.

Also, the game tries to convince the players that pineapples are an especially weird ingredient for pizzas.  They are, in fact, served by almost every pizza shop I've ever seen.

I do like how players are each associated with an ingredient, thus providing some diversification between their play styles.  But it is too subtle in the face of the other randomness.

I was wrong, this is actually better than Mamma Mia. The addition of "helping" improves on the old concept, making it more interactive (as do some of the new recipies).

I take it for playing on beach or something like that, so we can play it with kids. I'm not so satisfied with it. Maybe Mamma Mia is better, easier to play.

Though the orders are more confusing than [b]Mamma Mia![/b]'s, filling them is easier. And that's not even taking into account the fact that you can now ask other players for help! I wish you could feasibly play more than 2 rounds, but the 11 new orders aren't enough to get through a 3rd round.

If you've got both [b]Sole Mio![/b] and [b]Mamma Mia![/b], though, it's best to combine them and play [i]Grande[/i] anyway.

A nice addition/revision of the Mamma Mia idea -- tho, this one is a bit trickier.  Because of the complexity of some orders, it actually introduces *more* randomness into the mix -- as it is more difficult thn ever to accurately keep track of what's in the oven.  In any case, it's worth it.

RATING: 6
Overall, I found this to be less interesting than the original game.  The addition of the double ingredients adds an interesting twist to the game but also serves to unbalance the game somewhat as players who pick these up tend to have an (at least small) advantage.  I also am not a terribly big fan of the new order set.  They require much more explanation (and seem to be harder for some people to keep in mind) than the original set, though I was able to follow them once I understood what was going on.  I do miss the emphasis on the "personal ingrediant" that was present in the original game.  In addition, this set seems particularly geared toward the help mechanism.  That's fine, I suppose, but that gives even more weight to a mechanism that would have a pretty strong effect on the game anyway.  Finally, the help mechanism is bothersome.  In general, there is no reason to not help someone if you can as the reward is so great relative to those who are unable to help.  The problem is that it becomes essentially random who will be able to help another player out.  To me, this simply adds too much chaos to a game that already can be quite chaotic if players are not paying close attention -- something this game tends toward on its own.  The advantage is that the game does seem to play a little quicker than the original due to the (very much needed) shortening by one round.  Perhaps I would enjoy this one more as part of the combined game.  [07/05/2008]

Sole Mio! -- Every bit as good as [i]Mamma Mia![/i].  Perhaps better, but I prefer to introduce new players to the mechanic via [i]Mamma Mia![/i] before playing [i]Sole Mio![/i].

RATING: 7.5
A stand-alone expansion for Mamma Mia that adds some nice recipes and dual ingredient cards that truly enhance the basic game.  The rules are also complete, unlike Mamma Mia whose English translation omits an important step when playing with fewer than 5.

More complex than Mamma Mia, which makes it a mixed bag.  There is more going on here, such as the 4-3-2-1 possibilities, and helping others to help yourself, and trickier orders.  You can't rely as heavily on memory in this version.  However, the new rules are not as intuitive, and it comes dangerously close to being too complicated for its own good.  I like both, but the edge goes to the original.  I would like to give the game with both decks combined a shot!

[RGG 2004 edition] {Food; memory, cooperative} While Mamma Mia! focuses on memory, Sole Mio acquires more party-game-like rules and features. It enhances interactions and makes the game funnier and more dynamic. The "seek-for-help" feature is a nice add-on.

Got in a trade.  Then traded away in Math Trade 2010.  I read the rules and it looked like it just made Mamma Mia go from a fun game to a tedious one.  No interest in playing so I got rid of it.

This is nice enough, and there are some twists on Mamma Mia! that may make Sole Mio! a worthwhile addition to some collection. I like the double ingredient cards and some of the new recipe cards. Other recipes are too random (the one where an opponents picks the needed ingredient comes to mind) or powerful (fulfilling multiple series), and I definitely don't like the "asking for help" rule. In this isn't all that different from Mamma Mia! and I have no desire to combine the two games for the "Grande" version, so Sole Mio! is unlikely to stay in my collection.

This game makes me hungry.
I bought this game not realising it was a stand alone expansion to Mamma Mia. It has some strange orders that makes it difficult to teach such a simple game (aside from the difficult to read rules). I haven't played it yet, but I'd recommend starting with Mamma Mia, which I assume has more straight forward orders.

So, I tend to shun memory games because I don't feel like I have a good memory, but in Sole Mio, even though the memory element is the primary mechanism, it doesn't feel terribly taxing.  There are only a few different types of thing to track in the game, which certainly helps.  It gets a little trickier as you're trying to remember numbers of certain things in relation to which order cards you and the other opponents have played (and I expect that it would get a lot harder to keep up with as you add more players to the game), but again, it's not horrible.  I expect folks with really good memories would find the game too light, and not much of a challenge, but for me, I find it pretty charming.

I hope to learn and play this game in early 2007.

Edit: It is early 2008 and I still haven't played it.  Maybe I won't replace my lost Mamma Mia! deck?

EDIT: I played this in Sept. 2008 and frankly I think I like Mamma Mia a little better at first glance.  I could see this one being more difficult to explain and would find it more difficult to get to the table with the "right group or situation."

This came as a sweetener with my math traded copy of Mamma Mia.  We'll try the base game without these extra cards first but if we like it enough I'm sure we'll be adding more pizza fun to our game!

RATING: 7
This souped-up Mamma Mia! has a lot going for it, actually.  There's a catch-up mechanism for people that get behind, there's asking for help in making pizzas (but also helping an opponent in the process), and all kinds of weird new orders.  Plays fast, too!  I like it!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's not as straightforward as Mamma Mia!, but if you have played Mamma Mia!, the obnoxious orders (especially things like the food allergy orders) can be a welcome change.  Mixing the two makes good fun and surprises, as one unexpectedly failed crazy order fills an even more unlikely one later, and other such entertainment.

Juega ingredientes en una pila central boca abajo. Cuando creas que hay suficientes para completar una de tus pizzas colócala encima de ellos. Al final de la ronda se evalúan las pizzas. Si te faltan ingredientes los agregas de tu mano si es que tienes o dejas la pizza en tu mazo. Si hay suficientes lo has logrado.

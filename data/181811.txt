This game doesn't have enough ways to mitigate poor dice rolls, and poor dice rolls can really make the game drag.  The game also needs more types of dragons, with different powers to stay interesting.  Very disappointed with this one, and surprised it has praise from some well respected reviewers.

Clever game with a backgammon like feel.  It plays a little long and feels very chancy but there's absolutely skill and strategy involved and a skilled player will always beat an unskilled one. I hate the box/packaging.

RATING: 8.5
This game is fun :-) first of all it is a mixture out of Backgammon and Parcheesi and yes it is a game with dice that means you need some luck but like Backgammon you can split the dice and use different tactics to win the game. The material is fantastic, the stones feel good in your hands. Just add two more dice to make it perfect. There is one point I don't like, the game looks like perfect for travel but it isn't. The box it comes in is very odd and not made for days of travel and laying in your backpack. For me and my girlfriend it is one of our most loved quick playing games.

Tatsu puts me in mind of Backgammon—strongly so, in fact—but then played on a circular track instead of a linear one (causing stones to be borne off). But it isn't quite Backgammon, as you cannot stack stones: it's as if you'd play the game on points which can only hold two discs. Based on colour differences stones can then influence each other: holding them in place, hitting them, and another option I've since forgotten. I think it's an original take at least, but I grew weary of the game much more quickly than I thought I would. This was in part due to the somewhat confusing visuals, but I hasten to add that this seemed to afflict me uniquely as my partner had no such issue and proceeded to kick my butt wherever she could. (It's odd though, as I kick hers in Backgammon...)

I don't really know what to make of this game as a consequence, or whether it would stand up to repeated plays. Yes, it's by the author of Hive, but he also created Logan Stones and Army of Frogs. Then again, there's also various ways to end the game (notably by destroying stones of one type), allowing players to put pressure on their opponents by putting them in [i]gote[/i]. That's usually a rich source of interaction patterns.

I'm going to leave the game unrated for the time being.

I bought this game yesterday and when i tried to open the board, the shinny surface stuck together and tore upon opening. Then the flimsy board wouldn't open flat. When i put pressure on it to flatten it, it ripped in half.  How it plays I can't say. The board is in the bin. The score i give it is for the very nice pieces and the art work.

Edit: the designer has promised a replacement board so very happy. When i recieve it i'll play a few games and revisit my rating. Thanks John.

Clever take on Backgammon. The powers and there interactions make the game interesting. The game could linger too long if players are loath to put out their red pieces but this isn't too bad. It also worked well with my 8 year old son, something that Hive did not do.

I was sceptical looking at the box but there is a treasure of a game within! Quality!
Simple but interesting game play with dragons getting tangled, washed away or incinerated! Yikes! Also players travel in opposite directions creating a clash of forces on one side of the board and avoiding annoying and lengthy chases.
If dragons played Ludo to gain supreme dominance, it would look like Tatsu.

Tatsu is a good game, but I found the randomness and luck of the dice rolls way too frustrating.  You can set yourself up with good, high probability move options, and then not get any of the desired rolls.  Then your opponent rolls a 12 and wins.  Ugh.

I hoped it should be my new abstract game for Essen 2016. But meih, the dices are ruing it a lot! Ok, you can choose what to do with the dice but that's it! For the rest it's totally random. It's a pitty because the components are great!

RATING: 8
Nagyon élvezetes kétfős absztrakt játék. Méghozzá kockával. Backgammon alapokra épít, de kicsit modernizálva. Három típusú sárkányunk van, körbe-körbe haladgatunk a táblán a korongjainkkal, és megpróbáljuk megnehezíteni az ellenfelünk dolgát azzal, hogy blokkoljuk, kiüssük vagy megsemmisítsük a korongjait.
Egyszerű szabályok, gondolkodtató, döntésekkel teli játékmenet. Persze a kockák miatt van egy kis bizonytalanság, de ügyes stratégiával a legtöbb esetre fel lehet készülni valamennyire. Nyilván nem árt némi kockáztatás is.
Valószínűleg nem lesz akkora klasszikus, mint a szerző másik játéka, a Hive, de azért erős alkotás mind mechanikailag, mind kivitelezésre (nagyon szép a tábla, a korongok, a grafika).

I enjoy backgammon and this is certainly more fun, but I'm put off by the terrible looking game board - it looks cheap and nasty and given the quality of the pieces it's a real shame. I'd have preferred a simpler design with a single rather than double track where pieces are stacked, thus a piece on top of another traps it. That would require the pieces to also have a ring of colour on their sides and so it's not even as though you can craft a nicer board yourself

RATING: 9
This is a brilliant and original game. It's extremely difficult to invent a new abstract game with simple rules, interesting dynamics, and original ideas, especially one that uses dice. Tatsu is very engaging, easy to learn, and great fun to play. Tatsu has surprising variety, lots of choices, and a cool risk/benefit mechanism that unfolds with every roll of the dice. As you play more frequently, you begin to appreciate the strategic subtleties as well, especially in regard to the use of the red, green, and blue dragons. Should you place them all on the board as soon as possible or hold some back? Do you play a blocking game or play aggressively? All of this depends on your read of the risks and benefits of various die roll combinations. In that way the game is similar to backgammon. But where it really shines is in the various ways that pieces entangle each other, their different powers, and that some are merely annoying and others are deadly. This could soon rise to a 10 but I want to get more plays in before rating it so highly. Tatsu is one of the best and most accessible new games in years.

I'm not the biggest fan of abstracts, but this one was okay. Still, it's a roll-and-move game in 2016. You still have some choice on which pieces you move, but the game is pretty luck-based.

RATING: 8
Well-balanced, well-constructed rules and setup (particularly appreciate that one must pass the opposing player's entry spaces before being able to get a fire dragon); easy to learn, with three types of piece action and a Parcheesi-like movement dynamic; as with all Yanni games, the pieces are beautiful, and miraculously, it's a dragon game with minimal intercultural awkwardness, unlike almost everything released in 2017. Definitely a potential classic here. Biggest dislike: the packaging. Dude, why are the dice even on the cover? I don't put a picture of my liver on my author photos, because it's just a mechanical part, not designed to be visually appealing. Same thing. Also I dislike inset plasticky stuff. How about a flat cardboard cover with a sort of openwork look (like the pieces themselves) involving fire and water dragons biting each other's tails with vine dragons woven between them? That tells you *exactly* what the pieces do without making reboxing a chore and without, I dunno, sort of making the game look less strategy-driven than it totally is by putting dice on the front. Other than that... nah, can't think of anything else to improve.

GenCon 2016

I really enjoy this game. Part of that comes from being a fan of backgammon. I had no idea this was coming out or that it would be at GenCon. Stumbled upon it while exploring the vendor hall and purchased it in the middle of my demo. Looking forward to introducing more people to this game! 

I do have to state my distaste for the box, though. For now, I've found that the insert fits perfectly in my New Bedford expansion box. Hoping to have the board printed on a playmat that can be rolled up like Onitama for better portability.

Probably not for me... and certainly a disappointment, given that it's from the designer of Hive. Perhaps there's hidden depth here, but this 2p-only roll and move game seems less tactically interesting than Backgammon or That's Life!. There's a lot of potential for the end game to drag out as well. Good components, but the box is lousy.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]If you've played Backgammon then you'll see some of those same elements in Tatsu, but by no means will it give you any advantage when playing Tatsu. During my first and only play of Tatsu I didn't feel like I had much control over what I was doing, but as the game opened up as we continued to  play. By the end, whether I had won or lost, I felt like my buddy and I both made meaningful decisions and found the dice did't end up feeling like much of a random element. Instead the die roll narrows your decisions to a reasonable amount. 

I really enjoyed Tatsu and I'm looking forward to playing again. I have a feeling my wife may enjoy it because we used to play a fair amount of backgammon when we were first married.[/i]

Ok, so after playing many more times with John during the Nuremberg ToyFair, this has quickly turned into one of the most addictive two-player games I've played in a long time. Everything about it is excellent! I love rolling the dice and figuring out the best possible move (read: less risky), the tactile experience of the playing pieces and I love the satisfying sound they produce when you knock an opponent's piece off with a water or fire dragon. 

This game is not only an excellent 2-player game, it is also an incredibly satisfying tactile and auditive experience. A fantastic accomplishment!

I keep really enjoying playing this. I feel like every single turn is a gamble...

RATING: 7
Borrows a bit from Backgammon and a bit from Parchisi, but due to the dragon powers and win conditions, it is still its own game.  There is more room for tactics and planning than the rules might suggest and there is tension in the game.  Be aware, though, that the game can occasionally run long (45 more minutes or more).

Played at UK Games Expo. I umm'ed and ahh'ed and nearly bought it but in the end was put off by the box - the flimsy cardboard type that wears out and falls apart very quickly. Hope the game is popular enough to get another edition with better packaging.

Update:
Taking this all the way to 10, baby! I am hooked. After even more games under my belt via the Steam implementation, I think I can accurately characterize this game as a cross between Backgammon and TZAAR. That's right, the last Gipf series game, specifically regarding the 2 different win conditions of either 1) No pieces in play (not ever able to move), or 2) The complete elimination of 1 out of 3 opponent piece types.

Clever twist on Backgammon. Even though there's the luck of the dice rolls, there's usually something you can do with it, if nothing else advance your tokens to come back around into position for another pass.

It doesn't seem like there's a lot of strategy to this game. Pretty much if there's an opponent's piece to ensnare, send back, or capture, you always want to do it. Then if there's a piece you can play to 1,2, or 3, you always want to do it if the opponent's pieces aren't too close. Then, if there's a piece to bring to the staging area you always want to do that. But it is fun to play it out and see what happens.

I really, really dislike what they did with the box, though. I'd prefer a traditional box to the plastic insert mess. Hopefully this will do well enough to get a new printing with a proper box.

The immediate, screamingly obvious things they should have done with the game was include a cloth board; without the rigid board this could pack up quite small, which I would like a lot more than the clunky package it comes in.

The Bakelite pieces are nice though. A good feel to them.

I do not usually play abstracts, but always enjoyed a game of Backgammon back in the day. Probably because it is less confrontational than abstracts that do not use dice, and because it does not require players to adopt scripted strategies or even a lifestyle (like Go). No wonder then that Tatsu hit my sweet spot. It builds upon the basis of Backgammon and adds interesting elements to it. And the game is beautiful to boot! Looking forward to my next play with my girlfriend while sitting outside on the porch, drinking a mug of hot choco.

Played once.  It was okay...but just okay.  We have other games we prefer that are similar.  It might be more enjoyable to someone who only likes this type of mechanic, but we're always reaching for meatier games if given a choice.  If we do want some abstract strategy or a simple head-to-head game, we pick Ingenious or Onitama most of the time.

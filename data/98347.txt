RANK: 2132

RATING: 6
This has got some good things going for it - the Diplomacy vs Conquest approach is extremely well done and highly thematic; scoring happens at points int he game thereby preventing that artifical end game build up; 8 different races to choose from. 

However, it also has some things that aren't quite my style - too heavily luck oriented; the combat is a little too 'in your face'. Plus the rules are very poor

Basically the two hour version of Twilight Imperium. We recently tried it with the print 'n' play expansion which removed a whole bunch of cardboard chits, shortened rounds, streamlined play, and added a series of additional actions you could make each turn. I like the exploration element (though for those arguing this is not a 4X game, no, you aren't really discovering anything), upgrading technology, and the balance of combat and diplomacy. It plays really well with two, but I want to try this with four. I'll give it an 8 for now.

UPDATE 8-15-14: Played it recently with the full complement of four players and it lasted for much longer than two hours. Not sure if it was because of the late hour (started the game around 10:00 pm) and/or the fact that two players were new. Hopefully a second game would be closer to 2-3 hours.

One of the best light 4X-ish type game ever produced that is fast, fun and easy to get into. 

It fits very well at the 'above entry level' type of space battle cum expansion game that could be completed with excitement in 2 hours. 

Lots of interaction and felt that some 'standard wargame mechanics' has been inserted into it. I love the open ended concept but yet controlled game system that leaves lots of simple decisions to be made. 

One slight drawback is the 'size' of the universe. It felt too small but appreciate it as it limits game play and time. 

Much better than some space game I know.

Very intriguing and I love the art. I look forward to playing this!

[updated] 

This game is a testament to Kickstarter done right. I just received the *very heavy box* and opened it. Wow wow wow. Components are thick, first-rate quality, die cuts are spot-on, and the game has some of the most beautiful art I've seen yet in a game. The combination of art and story are very compelling--It's clear that Ryan has put huge talent and heart & soul into the production of this game, and into his new publishing company Red Raven. 

I really look forward to finding time to play Empires of the Void and his upcoming titles!

It's the theme of Eclipse with the combat system of Nexus Ops. I love both of those, so this is turning out quite alright in my book. One negative: there's no real exploration at all in the game. Even if there were just discovery tokens (like in Eclipse/Nexus Ops) that would be an improvement.

A better space conquest/combat sim that Eclipse and an overall great space themed game.  The over abundance of cardboard ships and game imbalances keep this from reaching great heights.  I also think that the designer's artistic talents have grown since this was first released, so a redux of this title down the road would definitely be something to look for.

This game will inevitably be thought of as Eclipse light.  It covers much of the same area, star conquest, mining, etc, but with a different mix regarding accessibility and route planning.  Fun, not too serious graphics.  But the Settlers style trading cards with players whose galaxies you had no contact with, whilst bringing in some welcome player interaction, was illogical in theme terms and detracted from thegaming experience.  Happy to play again as an alternative to Eclipse, but it is not as satisfactory game.

As a huge Ryan Laukat fan (I love Eight Minute Empires and City of Iron), I really wanted to like this game, especially after the rave reviews it got on the Dice Tower. Unfortunately, I had very little fun on my single play. 

Bad die rolls when colonizing can be devastating, allowing another (luckier) player to sweep in and take what you had been aiming for for several turns. Lucky draws and the random board set-up can also give huge advantages to some players over others from turn one. I want to try this once more before I get rid of it, but I'm afraid this is headed for the sell pile.

RATING: 8
This is a delightful game.  It aims to be TI-light, and succeeds better than any other attempt I've played.  In the typical way, building up your forces and conquering planets is very satisfying.

That said, it has its defects.  The event deck feels both more random and much more limited than TI's political cards.  Players can easily be screwed by bad rolls in the early game.  And because you don't really know how many points everyone has, particular battles don't seem super critical and it doesn't yield that everyone-up-on-their-feet roll off moment.

Still, for all my complaints, this is an awesome little space exploration game and I love playing it.

A fascinating area control title, that incorporates the right balance of strategic planning, and random elements, providing many options during each turn. I enjoy the range of additional tech that can be found/researched (and implementation of a rudimentary tech tree system), and the distinctive approached between military and diplomatic conquering. The tactical cards add a good amount of strategy. PvP combat is very simple - but effective. Not the most complex game in its genre, but an absolutely solid representative. And the art... well... Ryan Lauket stands alone, as always, in this field.

RATING: 6
There are some good things here, but I really think this game is a good example of Kickstarter allowing publishers to get games to market without adequate development. 

In the bad old days, this game might have gone to a "major publisher" who would have had someone develop it more and clean up some of the rough edges. I'd rather not be the beta testing public for half-finished designs. 

That sounds harsh in this case, and I don't begrudge someone for bringing their brain child to market successfully. But when I played it, I felt like it ALMOST was ready to be an enjoyable game. As a 4x style space game, its up against some pretty steep competition at the moment, and this one has lost our local interest. I doubt we'll get to it again.

Wonderful 3X game that scratches my twilight imperium itch when I can't get it to the table. Definitely enough strategy and tech to keep me going as well as some fun fast and furious dice chucking combat.  The only downside is the fact the components are just carboard tokens for ships. Single sided planet boards and the expansions which is a must have was print and play only.

Combat could use with a severe overhaul, pretty dull.  Too few actions (and not in a nice this is tight feeling way).  A rather anti-climactic game, with little of value to return to it.

Another entry into the "light" versions of TI3, this one's a mix of good and bad.

On the bad side, that rulebook is horrid. Even the "revised" rulebook could use some love. The fact that they bothered to double side the system tiles is strange, since they're identical on both sides. The fact that the revised rulebook changed the number of actions per player from 3 to 4 shows the lack of development so typical of Kickstarter games.

On the good side the diplomatic actions, alliance bonuses and special techs are all a neat idea. Unfortunately, it comes in a bit long, probably 4 hours or so, which is about an hour longer than its peers. Combine that with its rules issues and you've got a game that will probably never be favored over games like [i]Eclipse[/i], which is a shame because I think this is actually a better game despite its issues. Anyway, in the end it's not bad, but not great.

This was one of the first Kickstarter games I ever backed and I'm glad I did.  The art work is fantastic, the components are solid and the game play is just plain fun.  It is simple to teach and yet still has a decent depth of play.  While clearly more of a war game than a civilization building game it is still unique within that genre.  I especially like the choice of having to either conquer or make friends with the different planets.  Definitely a new favorite.

Other in my game group were pretty excited by this one but I found it decidedly ....meh :snore: Its really slow, initially credits are very sparse making it very difficult to build what you need and there is a slight problem with a run-away leader, i.e. having more planets gives you more credits, more credits lets you build more ships so you can take over more planets thus getting more credits. The player with the most planets is also the first player for each turn thus they are able to capitalise more on the events ,many of which give additional victory points for the first player to fulfill a certain task. 

I did enjoy that game , but it felt very decided from the moment the first event turned up and gave one player a free planet basically. I like the token ships as you can pile them up and thus the board is less messy than it would be with plastic ship mini's.

Sold in 2016.

This game is gorgeous. I wanted to love it. I love the idea of building an army and upgrading ships... but that doesn't really work in the game. I wanted to use all of the variety available, but that just isn't beneficial. I tried to fix these things with house rules, but this just wasn't the game I was expecting, and ended in frustration. It should not be in the 4X family. If you feel the same, you may want to consider Ascending Empires instead.

Let me start by saying that if you are looking for a 4X Space Empires type game, then EotV is not it, its more of a 3X type game, as it's missing the Exploration part, you instead get to Expand, Exploit & Exterminate worlds and enemies/opponents or make friends with them. The game plays allot like the Video PC game Sins of a Solar Empire only on the table top, at least that's what it reminds me of. I have seen reviews online claiming that the easiest and best route to victory is through Diplomacy and making allies with planets (yeah maybe in a 2 player game) but we play 4 players, the best and what this game was designed for games and that route just doesn't fly, as your opponent will seek out and destroy your Diplomatic ships at every turn if you get too close and in a 4 player game, its not hard. Therefore conquest becomes the easiest route to victory in the end and the galaxy explodes in war, after war and with Tech races that boggle the mind, as players try to balance Credits (money), resources to build Tech & improved ship types to wage war to hold what planetary systems they have. Each race has its own special ability, which is cool and not one unbalances the game.

Overall I really enjoy this game, it plays wayyyyyy faster than Twilight Imperium or Space Empires 4x and turns go fairly quickly, not much downtime in between players and the Pre-Turn step, everyone goes at the same time purchasing ships and technology, so that helps.

All in all, 5 star game, the components are 3 1/2 stars, as they are all cardboard, so no plastic ships people but they are nice and big counters, go to BGG to see pics of the game.

RATING: 7
Interesting space game, sort of a hybrid of Nexus Ops and Eclipse. Has a lot of nice things going for it and a couple of surprises (like the way the Tech cards work for diplomacy and tech.) The tech tree can get a bit overwhelming. There are some nice options but it would take a few plays to be comfortable with all of them. This can be a nasty game too, and feel somewhat random with all the dice chucking. Overall, it doesn't do anything new for gaming but it does fill a nice: a good game for those who like space themes, exploration and combat and that whole general mess of things, but don't have a whole day to play something like Twilight Imperium and don't have the patience for the spreadsheet madness of Eclipse.

One of the rare successes from the board game projects I backed on Kickstarter.  An ameritrash style space conquest game that has a reasonable play time.  I tend to prefer more euro style games, but this one will stay on the shelf for those times when I don't.

RATING: 5
Pretty basic gameplay, in the end. Wonderful map tiles, so-so components (boring cardboard ships rather than minis). As many mentioned, the diplomatic aspect regarding planet control & what you can extract from these planets, is a more unique property of Empires. The races' ships aren't all that different, but with some varied technology, they can be unique enough. The game plays quickly enough for its genre & is quite fun & replayable the first few times. 

Update: Rupebook not too clear. Gameplay becomes routine somewhat quickly. Other 4X (3X) space games do it better & with more elegance. Sold for a hefty profit. Definitely not worth the outrageous amount that game-scalpers are charging.

This is my tentative rating after my first 3P game.  In which I lost by a huge margin.  But if I love it this much in spite of that, I expect the rating might go up.  

We played with the Key to the Universe additional material, and I am glad we started that way.  The differences between Diplomacy and Conquest are clever.  There is not much "tree" to the technologies, but I enjoyed the wide options.  Lots of 4X-1 goodness with a relatively short play time.  This feels like a winner.

Note: I have only played with Key to the Universe, but I would be hard-pressed even considering playing without it. Without the Key to the Universe expansion, the game seems overlong, with a difficult-to-manage tech tree that's a little sloppy. Questionable balance and pacing, as well. That said, this is all speculation, and with the expansion the game really sings.

For the time it takes to play this, I would rather play Eclipse. And if I have less time, I'd rather play Ascending Empires.

This game feels like it overstays its welcome. It takes about 4 rounds too long. The ships are broad, but very similar. I'd prefer fewer ships that are more distinct.

The card mechanic was a bit confusing and not terribly clear. 

Overall, the game doesn't really present anything terribly unique, nor does it do anything particularly well. I just feel there are superior options.

Based on 1 play with 3 players.

A space conquest game where you can opt to either diplomatically ally yourself with the neutral planets or attempt to conquer them with military might.

If using diplomacy you get bonuses that you don't receive if you conquer the planet. Since the bonuses can be significant, such as being able to build a ship unique to the planet, there is an early game push to be a diplomat. In order to be a successful diplomat you will need to have culture cards that match up to the type of planet you are looking to befriend and then make a successful dice roll based on the number of cards played. If you fail the roll you keep the cards if you succeed you discard them and get the planet card of your new ally.  This stage lasted to just around the first scoring at which point all but two of the neutral planets were allied to the players.

From that point on it was all about building ships and going about the board in an attempt to conquer opponents planets and weaken their fleets.

There are random events that occur each turn. Some will help the player who has the fewest of something and others relate directly to specific planets. Of the planet cards it looked like there were space pirates who would steal from ships nearby while the other planet cards would terminate the current ally relationship and allow the player who defeats the event card to become the new ally.

There are technologies you can build which will improve different things which is all well and good but I feel that it will ultimately come down to who has the better ships and wins more battles.

I had spent the first portion of the game building up diplomatic abilities to see if I could befriend a decent number of planets. Unfortunately, the culture cards I kept drawing were not of the type of planet I was looking to befriend and we were not really trading with one another. Once we got to the point of most planets being owned I abandoned the diplomatic leaning and started to try and build tech that would allow me to build fighters but at that point I was too far behind the curve. If I were to play again I would certainly try to get the tech to build stronger attacking ships earlier.   

This is definitely not my favorite type of game but if you like the genre you may want to check it out.

Really cool, but shows it's age on many parts. The turn structure is bad, and doesn't allow for reactions, and the combat system can be annoying, random and punishing. Very uncomfortable movement. Also, since each planet has a race attached to it I feel bad conquering them. The art is functional, but shows it's age. The cardboard ships are also ugly and bumming.

Needs a second edition - small touch-ups could make it great.

RATING: 5.5
Decent game but feels quite unpolished. The techs are not super well balanced (warp gate is so strong) and seems like more interesting techs could have been designed. Some action types seem really useless and the end game seems to revolve around warp gate + big attack somewhere. 3 actions is really little, seems like not much is going on in each round.

The components are really bad, recycling the same token for multiple uses just  doesn't work. Double-sided tiles with same thing on both sides is stupid too.

08-27-2014 - It's no TI3, and I don't think I'll ever buy it while someone else i know owns it, but it's a good game.  I'm trying to figure out how to describe it, and I don't know.  It really is TI3-light.  You've got your ship production, tech tree, battles, expansion, etc.  It just doesn't "do it" for me like TI3 does though.  Not to knock it, it's still a great game.  I do wish the component quality was better, perhaps that's what's missing.  Well, one thing that's missing anyway.  It just doesn't have the epic feel to it.  That's not a bad thing, and I wish I could judge this game solely on its own merits.  But I can't, TI3 comparison is just necessary since they're so similar.  It is shorter and easier to get to the table, I will give it that. 6 seems way too low, but I'm just not sure I'm feeling a 7 either.  6.5 for now, could possibly go up.  I doubt it will go down.

There are many space conquest strategy games out there. Most of the time, people play some of these games, borrow mechanics and add new mechanics to make it a better game. That was the case with Eclipse and Galactic Emperor which had some inspiration from Twilight Imperium. But generally when people do that, they try to make the game better in their point of view, but for empires of the void, they actually achieved the opposite.

I don't like TI3, but love 4x strategy games. So I do not mind playing another space 4X game. I also doe not have any problems with having randomness in a game, it's just that I think it's actually a problem with empire of the void.

I thought that TI3 had a slow startup, but guess what, it's even worst in empire of the void. I could successfully conquer my first planet near the half of the game while other players already had 3 planets. So I ended up being behind all the game and ended if 14 VP ( leaders had around 40 VP).

The problem is that the success of initial growth is determined by luck. Either for diplomacy or for military action, you need to make die rolls to succeed. But diplomacy is even worst because you also need cards which are also distributed randomly and generally 1 card is not enough to succeed (0.9% chance to succeed). So you get a double randomness element.

Another common problem with all 4X games that has an action system is that it does not scale with the size of your empire. If you control 1 or 20 planets, you still get 3 actions per turn. Generally you want either to get extra actions, or make the actions proportional with the empire size. A quick fix could have been that each planet card adds an action point.

So you end up that the "Warp gate" technology that allows you to move all your ship is essential to play. Other technologies like replication that gives +4 to diplomacy is also essential to make planet conquest possible.

Ship initiative is wrong. Normally, you make smaller ships shoot first and larger ship shoot last. That gives a reason to have small ships or mix fleet composition. But now Bigger ships are stronger and shoot first, so why build small ships? To take hits by using them as fighter armor padding, true. But if I shoot first and kill all your ships, who needs padding! So they should have reversed the initiative order of the ships. It would have made the combat system slightly better even if using the flawed "axis and allies" combat system.

The races seems unbalanced. Maybe I got a bad race, but in a game where there are unique powers, all of them should be useful in a situation or another. I don't remember well the race I played, I think they were the Mystic of Siri. Anyways, here are their special powers:

- Draw diplomacy cards from the discard pile. Interesting power, except that it cannot be used in the first 5 turns, since nobody has enough or the right cards to actually play them. So the discard pile is empty.

- +5 to diplomacy roll versus mystic planets. I get a bonus for 1/5th of the planets available, I will have the chance to use it once or twice per game. Give me a +2/+3 to all type of planets, that can be useful.

- Mind control: I an move an enemy ship if I have a ship in the same system. In another word, at the start of the battle, 1 ship retreat. It's not like if I could use that ship to attack other players, or if that ship turned on my side and attacked his friends. That would have been much better.

The card system is interesting but the problem is that your hand limit is so small, you draw so few cards and need so many cards (2-3) to do something meaningful. How am I suppose to accumulate 3 card of the same color when there are 5 colors in the deck and I have a hand limit of 3. It's going to take an eternity.

That is something that could have made this game unique since the double use of cards for diplomacy/conquest and special ability is interesting. But maybe being able to hold and draw more cards would have been the key to make these useful. 

Now there are a few other good points to mention. The fact that each planet can be allied or enemy is interesting. Personally, I would have made the planet cards double sided so that we could easily keep track of planet status.

The idea that players execute all actions on their turn at the same time is also much better than TI3 and Eclipse where you need to do 1 action at a time. But I would have added more actions. And by the way, mining once per turn for 1 credit is almost useless unless you desperately have nothing to do. Give at least 2 credits, or make it repeatable.

Some people mentioned in the comments that kickstarter games lead to junk games that would have been rejected by publishers before being released. I somewhat agree with that, and it's true that a lot of polishing would have been required, but it is far less worst than PnP publishing where the junk level is much more higher since in kick starter, people were willing to pay to get the game. According to the BGG rating, I understand that most people does not seem to hate the game than much. Still, we should see really few master pieces get released by kick starter, but I think some people will enjoy the game release there. 

My quick variant suggestions
- Each planet gives an extra action
- Mining is repeatable
- Hand size is increased or only reduced at the end of the turn.

Empires offers a more basic/pure 4x experience. Less fiddle, less turtle, yest still not as good as it should be. The issue is that it still plays in 2-2.5 hours and other games in our stable, like Eclipse, can be played with more bang for the buck. Further, the last few turns are min maxing which deflates an otherwise good experience to purely average.

Good to very good space game, which nicely fits a niche most games in the genre fail to fill. It doesn't get bogged down too much, is very confrontational and quite innovative. The parts of the design that follow the American design philosophy are where the game tends to crumble slightly (even though I tend to like games of in that school of thought) as you have to check the rulebook once or twice for some exceptions that might occur. Combat is easy and quick and the tech-tree is a breeze. Consider playing immediately with the Revised 1st edition rules and some additional races, which are free. The first addon is also, so you get quite some bang for your buck.

Pretty much requires that you print and play the updated rules and content, but as long as you do that, Empires of the Void is great. So far, this is my space 4x game of choice. Granted there isn't much exploration, but everything else is here in large amounts. I love how different each race feels, and choosing between diplomacy and conquering each world seems really balanced. Just a fantastic game all around. I only wish that you could play it with 5 or 6.

It's an almost perfect 4X space game. The amount of interaction is fantastic and the game is a lost of fun to play.

Nexus Ops ship building and combat, wedded with the Eclipse setting, round-based approach and tech trees. As such, it's probably destined to work. It's multi-player combat, with all it's inherent alliance and king-making issues. The limited number of actions means you can only make multiple piddly attacks or one massive attack per turn, and it's impossible to defend everything so if you're the one picked on in a massive attack, you just have to suck it up. The rules look clean but end up having a million holes when trying to understand board and card effects. Where it falls down is that by mid-game, points are zero-sum, being passed between the players. It feels like it needs more of Nexus Ops' mission-type ability to drive behaviour to pick up points along the way, independent of king-making driven behaviour. As a result, at this type of length, it strikes me as average rather than as good as it good have been.

First try: 

This is a 4X-light. All is there but very simple. I like that. 

The rules need a lot more explaining. We came up with several questions that we didn't find answers for. 

It's also a very good looking game. I really like the huge hex-boards, even if they take a lot of table space :-)

After a few more tries: 
The game playes really well, but after each session you're left with too many questions that are not adressed in the rules. Too many to remember to look up on BGG or in faq's. This lead to this game being put back on the shelf and never opened again.

RATING: 6.5
A cool space conquest game. This game is all about action efficiency. The two big ways this impacts the game is in ship movement and in combat. You only get 3 actions per turn, and there are only 11 turns. Moving a ship takes an action, which is horribly inefficient. There are two ways around this: upgrading diplomats and researching warpgates. Warpgates is a tech that allows you to move all of your ships for 2 actions. Upgraded diplomats can carry 4 fighters and another ship with bad initiative with it. 

When you attack something, you engage in one round of combat, so every ship in the combat gets to attack once (there are a couple of ships that attack multiple times). Because of the action cost, it is often sufficient to leave a few ships on a planet, even if someone sends a much bigger fleet. 

I like the special abilities of the different races, though I'm not convinced that all of the races are balanced. I also like the tech and special abilities you can get through diplomacy. 

I'm not convinced that the events are a good addition to the game. The scoring rounds are, of course, integral to the game, but the other events are pretty random, and often don't do anything. If an event does something important, it usually screws one or two players without affecting the other players at the table. I'm considering playing without resolving the non-scoring round events, and just using them as a clock. 

The early game feels a little wonky. It's hard to quickly get into a position where you have a good chance of taking over a world, so there is high variance in the early turns. I need to think about how to deal with this. It might be better to wait for a turn, and set yourself up to take a planet slightly later.

It had some shaky bits, and it took about 3 hours, but I think it is a solid start at a shorter, more playable TI3 for those who don't have all day to play a Space Opera.

I've always been a fan of 4x PC games, but the sheer number of players and time needed for a board game version has usually put me off.  I enjoyed my play of this game, but it runs a bit long for what it is - a lighter 4x game.  The tech tree seems a bit limited in scope as well as points.  I like the elements of using the cards diplomatically and I also like the alternative use that they have that don't cost you an action.  It's not bad and I would play it again, but only with the shorter version of the game.  I played with the Capital City promo and I thought that was a nice addition as well.

RATING: 6
I've played this game one and a half times.  After my first play I really enjoyed it and would have rated it much higher but after getting through a full game I noticed some serious issues, some of them having a lot to do with the end game.

The game is a 3x space game.  I say 3x instead of 4x because there is no exploration.  Everything on the map is revealed from the game's start and there is no hidden information to discover.  Players take turns researching one new technology and buying ships during a pre-phase and then each player takes 3 main actions after that (which can be increased with certain technology) and all those actions are done at a time in turn order.  These actions are standard 4x fare.  You can move your ships, attack, conduct diplomacy, and even mine for more money once per round.  Diplomacy gives you more benefits than conquering neutral planets but is more difficult.  There are 3 scoring rounds across the game's 9 rounds and the person with the most points at the end wins.

This game is very entertaining for a while.  Each player has their own race with their own asymmetric abilities and there are a bunch of different technologies, ships, and kinds of planets to exploit.  Even the events that happen at the start of each round vary up the gameplay a little bit to present new options and challenges.

However about halfway through the game I noticed that the game doesn't have the scope that I would like out of a game like this that takes 2+ hours.  The map is reasonably small and without any exploration players are really shoehorned into inter-player combat about halfway through.  This puts the players focusing on Diplomacy at an immediate disadvantage for 50% of the game.  It also doesn't allow for a lot of gameplay options, you spend half the game attacking opponents where the point gain/chance of success is highest and this can get quite monotonous.  This is all my observations in a 3-player game.  With four you would accelerate to this point even faster since the size of the board does not increase with player count.

I also think the way turn and action order is designed is quite awful once you hit the point of required player interaction.  Taking all 3 of your actions before the next player can act can have a player finding themselves trounced by multiple other players before they have a chance to do anything and this can be quite frustrating and unfun.  And if that weren't bad enough because of the way turn order goes clockwise but starting player moves counter clockwise the same player or multiple players can have multiple turns against someone in a row across two rounds.  I know for a fact this can happen because it happened to me and that soured me quite a bit on the game.

The final major issue I have with the game is the rulebook and even text on the game components.  It is awful.  They use multiple phrases or words to refer to the same game element.  For example on the technology sheet is a technology that refers to Starfighers as "Starfighters" and RIGHT ABOVE THAT refers to them as just "fighters".  There is plenty of room in that space that there was no need to abbreviate the word and cause this confusion.  There were several other spots where rules were so poorly written, not explained, or terminology was used interchangeably that caused actual arguments, confusion, and constant game slow-down to search the internet for clarifications.

Other than that the components are mostly good.  The board tiles are pretty and all the artwork is done by Ryan Laukat whose style I quite enjoy.  But I would honestly be more forgiving of a lower quality/uglier board game with a great rulebook than vice versa which is what we got here.

There are too many much better games in this genre to spend such a large chunk of time on this one.  It is passable and has some interesting and fun mechanics but they are overshadowed by the flaws and linear late gameplay.

Meh.  Another planetary conquest game.  Build ships fight over planets; but in this one you get to research stuff!  Oh, wait, that is just like every space conquest game.    This one does have a pretty neat system where you can take a planet over with diplomacy or via conquest.  The diplomacy is actually harder to do; but comes with bonuses.  And another cool part is, once you are allies with a planet, the opponents can only conquer it.  And vice versa, if you conquer a planet, opponents can only ally to it.  Interesting twist in an otherwise blah effort.

I would like to give this another try as with the first play it wasn't what I was expecting. I think action and tech system is more complicated than it should be when the board play is really about knowing the planets and what you plan to go after.

This is truly a unique take on the typical "4X space empire" style of game.  The way in which players must decide whether or not to conquer or ally with the alien species on the various planets, and the plethora of interesting powers that they can potentially learn from those strange species, makes for a very interesting and varied game play.  The artwork is exceptional, with gorgeous planets and wonderful alien races.  There's a lot of cardboard in this game, and it's all beautifully illustrated.  I'm a little concerned about the fact that the game rules have received 2 major revisions since the game's release (with the second revision bringing the rules back closer to the original rules), but in the end it's a fun and sprawling game for players that have a few hours to compete over control of the galaxy.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 8/10

excelent improvement on Twilight Imperium, I wish there were better quality components, a tight race to the finish in 2 hours or less.  not for 2 players. I think the game is highly ballanced, each race has a planet in the galaxy which matches it's atributes, once you know what planet has the ability you want you just have to get there. each bonus has a counter (cloaking and detection) the plasma bombs are a great part in equalizing bad rolls. Money is easy enough to come by, cards can make it easy to obtain what you need. the catchup mechanism of kill the leader is typical and it plays well with 3 or 4 players.

[FEB 2015] Provisional rating based on a part-way playthrough. 

Artwork is very good and consistent. Quality of the components varies from ok (the counters) to very good (the board hexes - these are huge and colourful) to not so good (the rulebook).

Simple game to figure out, plays quick. Three actions feel too limited but the tech tree gives ways around it. Though that introduces tracking whether you've used that as well. Some extra turn counters which you could flip (akin to World of Warcraft: The Boardgame) would've been nice here.

Diplomacy and alien unique ships are brilliant concepts. Gamesystem on which these ideas rest isn't really fully developed and tested and that shows sometimes. Ships balance isn't really good: especially the point of the Sunhammer I do miss. Lots of resources (both its cost as the tech needed to be able to buy) to get it, but when you do it isn't even on par with equivalent stack of starfighters?

However, I enjoyed the game and there is definitely potential in this one. Will print Key to the Universe and play with full compliment, expect rating to be revised upwards after that.

[UPDATE OCT 15] Revised rating by 0.5 point upwards after playthrough with 3 friends. It turned out the card system was for some hard to figure out. Also, a friend of mine didn't adjust his playstyle according to the fact that combat is very costly (costs a lot of actions to really wipe someone out) and there is no automatic pinning (as in Eclipse). Still, a fun game and the best thing is that it is even shorter as Eclipse, thus making it viable to play on a weekly evening (very important factor for us). 

Have to say that in the category of light wargaming short enough for an evening I'd prefer A Game of Thrones, Chaos In The Old World or Nexus Ops over this game, but for a space wargame it's the best option currently. 4X, Eclipse and especially TI3 simply take too much time. Only one challenger left: Exodus.

[Update Feb 2016] lukewarm reactions to proposal to bring it again to the table resulted in decision to sell it off. Can't see it getting much playtime between cotw, agot, fief and exodus: proxima centauri.

This game feels very beta to me. The rules need tons of work. Does fighter mean starfighter, or all your ships, or certain ships? Does 2/1, 3/1, 4/2 represent victory point levels on score cards for the Galactic Counsel? What are the boxes on the galactic counsel board for... represent turns? represent influence? Either way, what do I use as a marker? Those are just some of the items I do not understand their intention. Oh well, our house rules defined it for us.

Severely limited actions and high randomness in attacks/diplomacy actions. Three actions seems like it is not enough to handle fun attacks. You may get a couple attacks off, but that is it. I do not like the idea of moving all ships to one spot for one attack, as it removes strategy for ship movement and all the randomness on that one attack.

This game has some good spots. The structure of the hexagonal regions of space makes for interesting and new game experiences. Technologies that give you better abilities require money and certain resources. Makes for great strategic ways to build up your empire. The difference between becoming an ally and conquering a planet is intriguing. The artwork is pretty sweet, as well.

Overall, this game needs some extra attention. Not sure if this is what is to be expected from an initial release from a Kickstarter. They got their investment so now just release it. I would guess a lot of the play-testing did not work out the inconsistencies and questions needed in the rule book. I feel this game could be more replayable if the randomness was less dominant in attacks. And, this game could be better for casual gamers if the rule book was complete.

Empires of the Void is a relatively quick-playing entry into the space conquest genre. Oddly enough, it reminds me of Sid Meyer's Civilization. Players are trying to research technology, build up and defend an empire of planets, and even invade other players' holdings. The twist is that, when taking over a planet, you can choose to use diplomacy (more rewarding, but more difficult) or force (easier, but less rewarding). You can even mix and match on the same turn (if diplomacy fails, try lasers!).

The rulebook could use some work, but once you figure out the basic procedures, gameplay is actually straightforward. Combat is quick yet interesting. The various ships, technologies, and racial bonuses will keep the game interesting for fans of thematic games. This is not a particularly deep game, but it's not trying to be. All in all, despite the fact that I'm not the target audience, Empires of the Void is a conquest game that I can enjoy.

one of the best kickstarter games I've played - yeah there's things that could be improved on like the rules or maybe real ships vs cardboard, but I really enjoyed the design and the play looking forward to playing again.

5/12/2013 still can't bring myself to read the rules - What I've read about combat still makes me cry. I secretly wish for a pimped out setup for the pieces though. Maybe someday...

7/17/2012 Kickstarted - However from what I keep reading...I'm hopeful for a "Band-aid" like repair expansion.  Especially for combat!

To date, this is the best spaced-themed 4X game I've played with 2 players. Solves the usual low player count problem of these games by subjecting diplomacy to non-players, which is the best way to do it. Also plays in a very reasonable amount of time. Do yourself a favor and print out the free expansion for it as well.

Currently one of my two favorite space conquest games. Plays quick, has lots of fun options, and allows for lots of annoying diplomatic agreements with and against other players. I hope it gets expanded, because some extra variety could transform this into a real winner.

This is a very well thought and interesting empire space building game. It worths the time that you will spend with it. All rules are intuitive and simple. The technology aspect of the game is an integral part of taking advantage of the unique abilities of your empire, and this is where you will spend most of your agonizing choices. The diplomacy cards is an excelent mechanic that combines diplomacy and extra actions. Very well designed and interconnected game. The second time that you will play this game, you will realize how well designed it is. The game has dice but luck is greatly moderated with the "telepath and photon cubes". Make sure you play with this additional rule that the designer has added (it is not in the rulebook, but it is here in BGG). Great space game. There are many space games. Think of it as the new twillight imperium II (as TI2 was when it came out long time ago). The components are very nice. I would have preferred plastic spaceships, but this is all I can complain!

Finally got a first play through and I like it. It's a bit quirky in a couple of ways but I'm hoping it will continue to grow as we get more comfortable with the rules set. A 2-1/2 to 3 hour window is nice compared to TI3.

not too bad and not long, euro-ish space expansion and domination game; definitely lighter fare; set number of rounds; not too complex; plan ahead, destroy, dominate, get resources, and get your points for victory game in space; short battles with ships;  making alliances with planets instead of conquering them seems to help more; the game end seems to always come faster than you expect so prepare ahead of time for the win

Main problem is that TI3 and Eclipse exist and both are lightyears better. This one tries to be TI3 lite but has taken simple too far and removed depth and fun from the game.

Good game, not short (in playing time) but always feels short (like I develop a strategy but too little time to exploit it)

[+] artwork is good, love asymetric powers, dimplomacy vs military options, sense of progression (from a few ships to full squadrons!)
[-] player (-almost-) elimination, some stalemate situations (I have 10 ships, you have 10 ships, I loose 5, you lose 5, I will build 5 more, so will you...game ends)

(June 2012) - I have played a glut of space games recently with the game group.  Almost approaching medievil theme levels at times.

It was OK, but I am not a big sci-fi guy and the special ships/abilities did not grab me.

I like the weight, theme, quality of the game, but the rule book REALLY could use a huge face-lift.  Would have liked some parts of the game to be plastic ships, tokens, or something. Not sure I like EVERYTHING being just cardboard. Overall, the game has a lot of potential, and I think it could be fun, but my gaming group got so frustrated with the rules that we didn't even finish our first game.  Not sure I'll buy games on Kickstarter again unless I know the company and can expect a certain level of quality.

Traded away...

Favorite 4X-like game by far. Not just a TI3 light, but as good as TI3 (SACRILEGE, I KNOW). Each race is fun, both military and diplomacy are fun and viable. 

Want to try house rules for stronger non-starfighters and/or more actions per turn. A 10 rating doesn't mean I don't think it can't be improved. Kickstarter-made rulebook and rules shows clearly (did not kickstart personally)

Decent lightweight 3x game, with plenty of interaction and diplomacy, not terribly balanced and quite luck dependent, especially with regard to initial planet placement.

Some exploration element would be welcome, but more importantly the game would vastly benefit from a more versatile tech tree, right now most of the choices seem to be one-sided. Maybe I'm just missing something.

But overall thumbs up for an excellent independent release!

Very disappointing.  The game felt underdeveloped in a genre that is pretty saturated.  Despite the fact that there is a diplomatic option, the reality is that it is very difficult to conduct diplomacy in comparison to just going out and whacking planets militarily.  Consequently, the game seems to devolve into a one trick pony.  Since the combat system isn't really new or interesting, there is really not much to like here.

Also, unfortunately for the game, it comes out a few months after Eclipse, the consensus best game of the last 12 months.

Finally, pardon me while I go on my anti-Kickstarter rant:  This could have been a good game with further development.  Unfortunately, what Kickstarter does away with is independent development by professional developers.  Consequently, instead of being forced to be polished, a game like Empires of the Void gets released in a sort of partially developed way that will ultimately result in it getting kicked to the curb.  I don't think that Kickstarter will continue to have the success it has seen as more people realize that publishers really do serve a purpose.

[i]Empires of the Void[/i] gets a mildly positive rating from me, but everyone else at my table hated it.

If [i]Eclipse[/i] and [i]Twilight Imperium 3[/i] are your gaming epiphanies, you won't like EotV.  But if you're not an OCD planner (Eclipse) or a sprawling full-day gamer (Ti3), [i]Empires[/i] might be the low-rent space experience that you're looking for.  It's short (for its genre), bloody, and wacky.  If those adjectives appeal, borrow copies of [i]Empires of the Void[/i] and [i]Galactic Emperor[/i] (another lightweight space empire game) and make up your own mind.

Little messy but not a bad civ game underneath it all. The random setup of everything can lead to some turtling or bad luck for some players. The tech is kind of a mess, components-wise the game is kind of a miss as a whole there. Curious to see how EotV2 plays.

Still making up my mind about this one.  Pretty much all of the mechanics have been done somewhere else although the diplomacy deck and tactics adds a few changes.   It's main selling point is that's shorter and simpler.  But if that's what you want, I'm still not sure that I wouldn't rather play Nexus Ops.  On the positive side, there's not as much turtling as in other 4X empire games.  The tech tree is fairly boring.  Combat is too simple.  It seems ridiculous that a tiny fighter can knock out a much larger ship with a single hit.  When you have weak ships fighting other weak ships, it can take many turns before a winner is determined rather than simply fighting until there's a winner.  The components are nice, especially the board.
Rulebook is missing too much information - need to look at the extended errata and FAQ to be able to play.
Despite everything, my second game was fun and others enjoyed it.

A galactic war and explore game, that lacks the length of things like Twilight Imperium or Eclipse, and scratches a very different itch - though it has some charms for sure.

Diplomacy is done really well in this, to the point where everyone *will* want to get a few allied planets under their belts. Both combat and diplomacy is clean, but utterly at the mercy of dice rolls, but the game is mellow and short enough for that not to ruin it for me.

I LOVE the board too, the system hexes defo win my award for nicest looking out there (though why not print something slightly different on the reverse of these rather than the exact same on both sides).

Personal tech advances, individual race abilities and a mountain of available ships serve to round off a game that real feels like it should be heavier (and longer) but really doesn't play that way - you'd be hard pushed to exceed 2 hours.

Cardgame with really outstanding mechanics, ruined by 'controversial' theme and lack of polish. I hope that one gets reprinted one day.

Absolutely the worst CCG ever made.  Just touching the cards made me feel the need for a shower.  Grotesque artwork makes this a game you NEVER show to anyone under the age of 18, unless you want to pay for therapy.  If someone gives you this game, pour holy water on the cards and then burn them.

My favorite CCG, havent played it in about 15+ years. What I remember of it is that it played really fast and that it was quite easy to get an decent deck. I played with Hareb-serep or something like that.

The most disturbing and disturbed of all CCG's.  Excellent mechanics though.

It was the first CCG I started collecting and playing, but the collectible aspect turned me off after a while. The setting and the story were the things I enjoyed the most about Kult.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Yes, this is dark, the theme is dark, the artwork is dark.  It works for the game though.  The whole KULT setting is really pretty interesting, so if you are not easily offended and like horror, this might be one to check out.  I think the game is pretty good actually.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I have the entire collection... in Italian.  :)

This is not a game I'd play, I preferred the rpg. 

Some people are concerned about the theme, but it is certainly NOT a struggle of Good against Evil, that cliché we have seen over and over again... 

Here is where the setting shines the most, and here is where it is most unsettling for the common CCGs player.  

I'm not very impressed with the system. It has been a long time, but I remember that - if they haven't changed the rules - with a certain combination of cards, you could never lose.

I played this over 15 years ago. I thing we got the rules wrong, and the game would NEVER end. Ugh, it was a clunker. Still, I find the mechanics to be novel, and I love everything about Kult!

One of those "I really wanted to like this" games. Some great ideas, a few clever mechanisms (in particular the mystic cross, and the markings on cards showing where in the cross they can be played), and gorgeous cards - but a lot wrong with it, too. All the requirements for playing cards make deck-building too complicated for casual players; too many different cards too poorly differentiated; it's too difficult to use spells for too little benefit; combat is too simple and deterministic to be interesting; it's too difficult to cycle cards and modify your cross; and too much depends on your starting hand. If one player is able to place a lot of cards in their mystic cross before the other player, the game is over.

After multiple playings, I have to say this game just gets worse and worse.Every time, the game was won by the player who drew the best first hand. Being able to discard only one card per turn - coupled with all the restrictions to playing cards - means you cannot cycle your cards fast enough to recover from a bad draw. Being largely unable to modify your own mystic cross does the same. It's hard to believe this game was ever playtested.

The mechanics are really easy and actually, doesn't give a lot of chances of different kinds of game. I think it is the aesthetics of the themes what really makes you enjoy it (you may create a deck around a topic, but you could do it very random with every dark thing you encounter).

+ theme!

+ very meaty ideas
+ best CCG I've ever played. Second to none.

- it's collectible
- the more cards available, the more powerful deck you can make
- lack of balance in some important cards
- not for kids, girls etc.

In my humble opinion, this is the best CCG that has come out.

RATING: N/A
Of all the CCG's I own, there was something about this one I was not able to figure out. There seems to be a little more patience and nuance, but I am not sure. The card art is very well done but it is graphic, violent and unsuited to children. I would like to make a game of Candyland with them.

Among the better CCGs. Has balance problems, some cards are very effective. With little restriction, the game is quite playable. The dark subject matter and great-looking cards make this one quite enjoyable.

This is one of my favorite CCGs of all time. Very dark, very creeepy. The subtext matter is moody, the tarot card layout and token moving mechanic is inovative. Wish I'd have kept more of my collection but I gave most of my cards away trying to snag people to play with.

This was the only CCG I ever got into properly (no, Magic was fun to sell, but could never be caught playing it!) and that was in part the clever game mechanism and that I was already well into the RPG anyway. I still believe we ran the largest face-to-face Kult CCG match ever in the UK, one time, in Warlords of Leigh.

RATING: 10
A gem. The game and card mechanics are the best of their kind. The whole thing is so well interconnected. I have exchanged some e-mails with the designer (Bryan Winter). I believe this game is one of these things of extraordinary brilliance that come together unexpected. Bryan has designed other good games, but this one (at least for me) is his best creation by a landslide. Unfortunately, the art is great, the theme is disturbing (but very fitting for this game) ... thus a brilliant game that due to its theme will never become popular. On the other hand, maybe its theme is part of the greatness of this game. A solid 10!!!

RATING: 6.5
I really like the dark theme and artwork, but the gameplay is a bit so-so.  Moving the population around is a bit clunky and the cards don't seem to play off each other as well as some other games.  The cards are more interesting from a thematic point of view vs actual gameplay.

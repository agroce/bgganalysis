Nagyon kis egyszerű játék, talán túl egyszerű is. Mondjuk kicsit bonyolultabb, mint egy Pingu parti. Nekem egyébként a Vigyázz 6 jutott eszembe róla, csak egyrészt itt nem kapunk meg előre minden lapot, másrészt többféle kapcsolatot kell figyelni (a növekvő számok mellett a színeket több irányban is). Elég szerencsefüggő, de azért tehetünk is érte/ellene, hogy gyorsan megszívjuk. Ha nem tudnám, ki a szerző, Kniziára tippelnék, de nem ő követte el:)

I knew this is a light game and the main draw was the art. I have to say, I really enjoy it. Sure, it is light, but I find it a pleasant little puzzle to solve. I really like, that you need to pay a little attention to what your opponent is doing. Which cards are in their gallery already so you can't get, and what is possibly left in the deck that you might get into your hand and how should that shape how you play your current hand and where you place those cards?

I find the size of the cards to be perfect: much bigger, and sleeving could be a problem or it could become a table hog. Much smaller, and I think you'd lose some of the finer details in the paintings. Not a masterpiece by any stretch, but this is a game I am happy to have in the collection. So simple to teach as well, a great choice to play with non-gamers who appreciate fine art.

This is one of my favorite 2-player games in my collection, and it is SO underrated!

The balance and tension of what card to play and when, deciding whether or which floor bonus to race for, whether to start one collection on one floor and hope to connect it via staircase later on, watching what your opponent plays and how it will affect you... every choice is so important.

If there was any room for improvement it would probably be a variant with an art auction or a draft at some point, but that's just wishful thinking.

This game looks gorgeous, plays fast and makes me want to play it as soon as we're done. Every. Time.

This feels like Lost Cities with the "play first, draw second" mechanism and the dilemma over how long to wait for something better before playing a card. It's probably better with three players than with two; in the latter case, the first player almost always can get two gallery bonuses to the second player's one.

Classic art?  Alf Seegert? Gryphon Games bookshelf series?  This is a home run - a great couples card game in the Lost Cities niche!

See my pictorial review: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1393768

My only criticism of the game is that I think the gallery bonuses are worth a net value of 8 points, and over-powered, see discussion [thread=1387320]here[/thread].

Another Gryphon Bookshelf series classic.  It's like a super light version of Ex Libris or Oceanos.  I love games where you are trying to get everything to sort in order and have to deal with the cards you have on risk playing something to far left or right hoping to top deck the right card at a later draw.  Really builds for some fun tension.  I also like that this game has a modular setup with the stair cases which give the the game just a little extra so it doesn't feel too samey every time you play.

Musee is awesome! It apparently works with 3-4 players as well, which is a bonus, but I've only played it two player. It is the newest go-to game for my wife and me when we don't have a lot of time or we just don't want to mess with a big setup. 

It is right up there, and even surpasses in many ways, Jaipur, Lost Cities, and Morels as my two player game of choice.

* Kickstarted! *

Place one of the five cards in your hand into your three level gallery -- but with the catch that the cards (numbered 1-50 in a 2-4 players game and 60 in a three) have to be placed down in order, there are bonus points for pairing up by colour side by side and on either side of the staircase, and bonus points for being the first to complete a floor. It's very easy to grasp, quick to play -- a perfectly light starter game or end of the night game, but it never really has the sense of theme take over or encourage deep investment.

PLUS: easy to learn/play, quick, use of art
MINUS: theme doesn't come through, lacks investment
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.4
Musee is an excellent, light weight game.  I really like that even though the basics are extremely simple, there's a lot to it.  Connecting themes with staircases and galleries is extremely important and almost more so with the staircases.  Rushing to complete gallery levels gives the most points, however making that your only strategy will most likely result in a loss.  It amazes me that such a simple game can have so many choices.  Excellent game!

Fantastic game in the same vein as Lost Cities and Battle Line.

This is super light but there are decisions about where you place cards based on maximizing your score on the basis of where you have already placed cards and what have already gone as well as the likelihood of what you want is going to come up. 

This is very much multiplayer solitaire and is essentially a puzzle. Other than your opponent using things you want there is no interaction at all.

Its ok, simple, quick , is it going to grab players? Time will tell.

These were my thoughts when reviewing this game for my 2015 end of year geek list.

"This is an even lighter card game. A very easy quick game to play over coffee. Hanging paintings in a gallery with a few placement rules to follow. Play a card pick up a card. An extremely easy game to teach, slightly harder to master but as you do you realise the luck element of the card draw plays an increasing role in the success of your game. The game is all about mitigating this luck so I do feel that players in the long run do not have an even keel during the game as each will obviously have a different draw from the common card deck. 

I still really enjoy it though for the light game it is. I have really enjoyed the art work and discussing it with the kids. A keeper for now (as I still really enjoy playing it) but I can see the a day ahead when the dark clouds of the trade pile will loom over its lovely produced eagle-griffin game box!"

I have changed my opinion since ... I now completely love it and fully embrace its luck-of-the-draw, simple-to-the-mind lightness. Let's face it not every game can be a Terra Mystica or Arboretum. This game is lovely and light and quick. Properties of a game which I am beginning to appreciate are very hard to design and still be interesting. 

I cannot see myself trading this away as it is just becoming more enjoyable and fun to play. Yes it is simple, yes it is not going to force you to wrangle your brain into aubergine spaghetti, but there again not every game you have needs to do that. This is a light welcome relief to the majority of other games I have in the collection.

Played this with L. on our first GNO of the school year and we both enjoyed it. It's very relaxing and quite elegant in its simple gameplay. I did find myself worried more about colors and numbers rather than immersing myself in "building a museum", but the end result sure was gorgeous. Easy to explain and rulebook was just as easy to decipher; not bad for not having prepped myself and for reading things on the fly at Panera.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]The third card game on my 2015 top 10 new to me games. The theme shines through, and the combination of Lost Cities sequential card play combined with a spacial aspect confined to the layout of your museum is brilliant. It is too bad this game seems to have flown under the radar, it deserves more attention. For what could be just an abstract card game the choice of theme is perfect.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]- Love the aesthetic of the game, really nice over sized cards, nice tiles with the chandeliers/staircases not to mention the great choice of artwork for the game. The graphic design is excellent as well.
- The theme shines through, this game looks beautiful on the table especially once you finish your museum.
- Has a similar feel to other classic 2p card games like Lost Cities and Battle Line [i](*Musee does play up to 4)[/i]. 
- Perfect combination between ease of learning and plenty of meaningful decisions to be made.
- Excellent couples/family game, my wife really enjoys it.

Musee is another hit for Alf Seegert that has a great art theme with simple to learn rules that pack plenty of depth in the decisions you make throughout the game.
Musee has replaced Lost Cities for me (Battle Line is still my favorite though). [/i]

I feel so artistic when I play this game!

Components are really good quality, with nice and thick and will last over many plays. They have stands for some of the tiles, but we never use them, preferring to just lay the tiles down. 

Art consists of paintings of different styles and themes. Sometimes the colors used to differentiate the 5 themes can be hard to see clearly, but good lighting should negate that (We played a few games by candlelight during a power outage) 

The best time was when we played this with an actual museum curator during a recent party and it was a hit with everyone.

Overall, I wanted this one after seeing it played, and was not disappointed when I added it to my collection.

A Gryphon Games hozta a szokásos formáját, rendkívül jó minőségű és gyönyörű lapokat kapunk a játékhoz. Egy galériát építünk, ahol annyi a feladatunk, hogy az azonos témájú képeket egymás mellé próbáljuk elhelyezni vízszintesen és függőlegesen, ezért többletpontot kapunk, illetve még a galériánkban megtalálható összes képért is egyet. Elhelyezünk egy képet és húzunk egyet a mindig öt lapos készletünkhöz. A képek egy-egy egyedi sorszámmal vannak ellátva 1-től 60-ig. A sorszámok a galériánkban csak balról jobbra növekvően szerepelhetnek, így előfordulhat, hogy nem tudjuk teljesen megtölteni a 15 férőhelyes kiállítótermünk. A játék rendkívül egyszerű és úgy érzem minden a szerencsén múlik, mert a stratégia teljesen egyértelmű. Aki több egyszínű lapot kap előnyben van. Nem éreztem benne túl sok újrajátszhatóságot. Talán adhattam volna rá még egy ponttal kevesebbet, de bevezetőnek azért elmegy.

This game succeeds very well at what it sets out to be, that being the type of light, quick filler that puts me right to sleep.  Despite my personal lack of interest in filler-type games, this is a very easy to learn card game that still provides a decent amount of tactical decision-making for 2 or 3 players (the 4-player team variant just looks weird, though I haven't tried it).  Despite each player working at their own tableau, there's definitely player interaction in the form of having to keep track of what your opponent has played while attempting to withhold information about what cards you have in hand.  The physical components are excellent; the oversize cards bring out the beauty of the artwork, though it also leads to the requirement of quite a lot of table space for a quick filler.  So yeah, it's an excellent design over all, if you're into that type of thing.  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 2/5  Total: 6.5/10

Yes it does take up more table space, but with the Art on the Cards I am Very Glad they are bigger so you can appreciate the Artwork!  It is the components and the quality of the Game that jumps it up in ranking.

Quick easy rules, and a great two player game, and an interesting take on partnership with 4 players. 

 Wife actually wanted another game after...  That is always good!  

As always with an Alf Seegert game - Amazing Components and super quality from the insert, to the the box, to the rules to the cards, parts, etc.   

Once you quickly realize that the types of artwork are every 5 in there perspective numbers, it makes the game so much more interesting an intuitive...  Is my card coming... Does my opponent have it... Has it been played... Should I push my luck...   Oh no, I have to win the floor bonus... damn, I just drew what I needed... Or Yes, I just drew what I needed!  Has a bit of a Lost Cities feel from that aspect. 

In the end, it could have any theme, but the one that was chosen is excellent, and goes with the game well.

Bravo, on a really fun and great looking Game!

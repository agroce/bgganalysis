GAME: Exceed: Red Horizon â€“ Reese & Heidi vs. Vincent & Nehtali
RANK: 2996
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Fun and fast paced 2D fighting game. 4 fighters each play a little different.  Uses similar mechanics to BattleCON, but has a faster set-up and play time. Compared to BattleCON this game is much more about hand management and hand advantage than strategy and opponent reading.

RATING: 8
Great two-player, but isn't as fun as slapping down cards in a shedding game like "President." There is still that feeling of "Haha! I just out-trumped you!" Similar to Flash Duel, part of the fun is trying to change your strategy to fit your specific character's strengths.

RATING: 6
Different enough from BattleCON that I can see the market for both existing at the same time.  Faster-paced, yet almost as strategic.  You spend less time attacking and more time preparing, but at the same time, some triggers from BattleCON were removed, making it easier to score hits and prevent null beats where attacks miss.

A pretty fun version of the BattleCON system. I would have loved it probably if I hadn't been playing BattleCON for years. The characters just don't feel as different as the BattleCON characters and the moves aren't as interesting. Cool game but it pales compared to one of my favorites.

This game is very similar to BattleCON, but it does feel like it has a bit more depth.  There's really a lot of decision-making you have to do to set up and execute attacks.  Pretty good game!

[card combat / rock-paper-scissors, 2p]

Own four PnP characters from demo PDFs.  I'm currently using the Season 1 characters to teach the game, but I won't be buying more of them.  One of the PnP sets is not the final print version, and one of them is too low-res.  I'll be tossing them once I have other characters to teach the game with.

The core system of the normal attacks (the 8 attacks that all decks share) is just awesome.  Grasp is the fastest attack in the game, but it actually loses to Sweep and Focus at range 1.  The depth in play of the core normals is just amazing, and it's really satisfying to discover the way the combinations interact.  I was worried about Season 2 becoming handicapped by an inability to change the normals, but the normals were phenomenal the first time.  The core system out of the gate is a great framework that doesn't seem to need modifying.

However, the Season 1 characters seem to have passive abilities that are just power buffs without making the game have more interesting choices.  At worst, the character buffs seem to actually limit the other player's choices.  Reese doesn't give you your turn back, Lily can Grasp at range 3 (like seriously???), Ulrik can control the range of a strike when he initiates, and Alice is trying to keep herself in your new blind spot.

Season 2 looks awesome though, so see my comments on that entry.

RATING: 10
59 plays in and still, this is something I would be down to play almost every time. It's easy to teach as the ruleset is very clean, plays quick and only requires the cards themselves. 

The game itself manages a lot of options for just a deck of cards - when to strike or fish for more options, move forward or wait to counter, to attack or to boost, to take a calculated guess and go for a wild swing - and that's even before you take into consideration the characters and how they play differently from one another! Crazy! On top of that - the graphic design is great, the character art is awesome, and the cards are thick.

As for cons: some people may be turned off by the randomness a deck of cards offer but coming from MtG and Hearthstone, that's something I learned to deal with. Another con I can mention is that I wish this was sold as a single-boxed set because I had to buy another box for storage, but I do understand that Lvl99 is trying a different approach from what they do in Battlecon. But those are really just minor quibbles as my brain tries it's hardest to think of anything I don't like about the game.

Playing this feels really really exhilarating to me. The thrill of nailing something you set up several turns before, the disappointment of beefing a shot you knew would hit, getting that game-winning wild swing against all odds - Exceed is an amazing game. Everyone I introduced it to had a great time playing it.

Superb design. Exceed works in a similar vein to Level 99's other fighting-game simulator, BattleCON, but refactors the rules so that games take half as long to play - and one quarter as long to set up and take down.

A deep game built around prediction, positioning, and hand-management.

RATING: 10
Great, streamlined fighting game. It flows very smooth and plays fast, something I always appreciate, no fiddly bits, just cards. Not very prone to AP, which is also pleasant. I've barely scratched the surface, but can feel that there's considerable depth to the system and each character. Also, I'm a sucker for games with cards with multiple uses, so that's another plus. Just wished the box would be a bit bigger and sturdier to hold all the cards when sleeved, had to get some deck boxes to hold all the cards. Also would prefer a little rules booklet vs the fold out. Additionally, you'll need an opponent with a similar level of experience to get the most out of it. 

All in all though an amazing design, hoping for lot's of new characters and a deluxe version with a nice box, just like it's bigger sibling game: BattleCON. Looking forward to more games from Level99 now!

Update: after having played this 25+ times I can say this is one of my favourite games ever! Can't wait to play more and get more characters! Truly underrated and super elegant game. Can't recommend enough!

This is an awesome two person fighter. I love the variety of characters, the speed of play, the simple rules I can teach someone in minutes.
My only critique is of the season 1 art. The women are mostly huge-boobed and ridiculously dressed, though some are okay.
Since I primarily play this with my high school students, and with my wife, this is not an ideal art design choice.
But, Season 2 fixes this problem completely, so I'm not worried.

Definitely solves some of the few problems with BattleCON (less AP, easier setup); haven't yet played enough to know if it loses any of the awesomeness... but after 100 games of BattleCON I'm excited to try something new in the same vein.

But then there's the art. Designer Brad Talton has made an eloquent plea for people to judge the game for its gameplay without condemning it for Genzoman's crappy sexist art. I don't know if that's a reasonable request-- Level 99 chose to publish a game that depicts most women as sex objects, whether or not anybody in-house made the art. But whether it's a reasonable request or not, I can't do it. I know from experience (with Yomi!) that Genzoman's particular style of fantasy-fodder illustrations bugs me MORE on repeated exposure, not less.

The releases for Exceed: Red Horizon were planned (intentionally) so that the most egregious illustrations were confined to two of the boxes, and the other two are pretty okay.

RATING: 7
As a Hong Kong backer I am one who's first to receive the KS copy. The gameplay is well crafted and faster than Battlecon, but it lose so much of Battlecon's spatial concept and in my opinion, Exceed is faster and easier to play, but Battlecon is much more rewarding. In short Exceed is better if you're playing with different players every time, while Battlecon is the game of choice if you have a constant opponent.
Edited on 26/6/2016: I have re-read the rules of Battlecon and Exceed, adn the most important difference being that in Exceed, there are no more 'start of beat' or 'End of beat' effects, and many of them would affect the positions of the characters on board, many a time before strike actual happens. This makes 'speed' much more important than 'position' in Exceed, as a fast attack would always score and the slower attack, even with effects that could shorten the range, would never happen if stunned. This effect is even aggravated by the fact that all boosts would disappear after strike, no matter whether it's initiated by you or your opponent.
The major selling point in Battlecon is that it simulates 2p fighting game. Exceed appears to be somewhat lacking and trimmed down too much.
Edited on 2/7/2016: Got a chance to play with Bun, who has been my Battlecon component for most game. We played 10 games straight with 8 different characters. We both found that with the lack of start of beat/ end of beat effects, the speed of the cards become too important and make this game rather dull when compared with Battlecon. The characters also lack the 'signature move' and do not leave anything remarkable despite 10 games played.
Strangely, I believe Exceed is going to get played more often as it's much easier to learn and play.

Very fun game, easier to pick up the rules and physically carry around than Level 99's other fighting card game, BattleCon. The rules sheet is in desperate need of a retooling and requires some further explanation when it comes to EXACTLY what a normal, special, and ultra card are. Also, working links to the website would be nice since the QR code exclaiming "Watch the Tutorial!" leads to a 404 error on Level 99's website. Foiled cards are extremely warped compared to other cards so don't expect to ever fairly play this game without sleeving.

RATING: 8
I didn't expect much from this, being that it is from Level 99 Games and Jasco, two companies that have been very spotty for me in terms of quality. Excuse the pun, but Exceed really exceeded my expectations. I've played a lot of these board/card game conversions of fighting games, but I think Exceed is easily my favorite. It doesn't do anything that new or noteworthy, but it combines a lot of the best aspects of games like Yomi, Battlecon, and Flash Duel into a system that works really well. I'm a little annoyed that you have to track down all the individual sets, and having foil cards mixed in with regular cards promotes unintentional cheating while shuffling, but otherwise I think that this is the best fighting system Level 99 has come out with yet. It really feels like Magic: The Gathering if it was a fighting game. I hope this continues to get support, as well, as this really makes Battlecon obsolete for me. Puzzle Strike is pretty close to the same quality as this, but this game avoids the pitfall of the luck of the draw far more, in my opinion.

RATING: 9
At first, I thought there was no reason for this fighting game to exist when the same company was carrying the robust Battlecon fighting system, but it does feel different even when at the same time, it shares quite a bit with its predecessor. 

It just plays faster and there's less brain burn because you never really know what they are holding in hand, as opposed to Battlecon, which is open information.

Some other improvements are small details like renaming Soak to Armor, and Stun Guard to just Guard, which just makes it simpler.  

I still prefer playing two cards vs one because that's more personalized to the characters, as in here anybody plays a Sweep exactly at the same speed and power if they haven't played boosts before it.  In Battlecon, they are forced to combine the standard moves with a character's personal style, so if the character is slow, every move will be slow.

Only play tested the game with about 6-8 characters so far with my group for the last 2 months. My group and I absolutely love this game. This is a lot more accessible and faster than BattleCON and there's surprisingly a lot of depth and strategy to this game. It feels pretty different from BattleCON. There are things like hand management, when to play cards, and baiting your opponents.

Like many who have found this game, I also loved BattleCON; it's literally one of my favorite games of all time. I just find it hard to get that game to the table, as it requires a bit of setup and a fair amount of explanation to new players.

Exceed provides a faster, cleaner game with much of the same charm and uniqueness in its characters. It's also provides nearly the same level of depth to master your characters of choice. It's catching serious fire among my game groups and I feel it has the potential to be THE competitive card game, so long as word spreads.

Really enjoyed the print and play! It has a much faster pace than BattleCON and truly feels like you're exchanging blows.Both fighters felt incredibly differenthe and balanced. Out of the 5 games we played, Alice won 3 out of 5 and only by 3-4 life difference each time. 

My main negative is the rulebook for now. There are a few questions that came up that would need an FAQ online etc. But all of them were situational. Nothing major. 

I would definitely recommend backing their game. If you love 2p games, and/or fighting games give this one a shot.

Note that my rating is for the system as a whole. I've mixed the characters from different sets and so far none of the characters stand out as exceptionally bad or good, so they all get the same rating.

BattleCon is dead, all hail the new BattleCon!

Seriously, I loved the idea of BattleCon but hated the game itself. My biggest issues were the lack of any randomness, massive AP, and the complicated timing structure of each round. Exceed fixes it all and makes even more improvements.

First is the much-needed randomness. Now instead of having a huge hand of cards that has to be analyzed by both you and your opponent (your hand of cards in BattleCon is essentially open-information), in Exceed you just draw cards from your deck and work with what you have. It's much more tactical and much more satisfying. In Exceed each card now has two different uses so hand management and setting up combos is more important.

The timing structure is much, much better and flows so much smoother in Exceed. When it's your turn to attack you just look for any Before effects, any Hit effects, then any After effects. Then your opponent does the same. No more "beats," no more ante tokens, no more needless complications of BattleCon.

The "timer" has also been improved. In BattleCon you had to remember to advance a timer each round, and if time ran out you would then determine a winner. It was almost impossible to ever remember to advance the timer. In Exceed, if a player's deck runs out for a second time they lose. Very simple, and there's nothing to track.

BattleCon also eventually added rules about using a hit gauge for various effects and different ways to perform your special attack. Exceed simplifies all of that: when you land a hit, you put the card into your "gauge" area. You can eventually spend your gauge to perform your special attacks. It's that simple.

It feels like Exceed is what they originally wanted in this system but they just didn't know how to make it work, so we had to suffer through BattleCon until the system could be refined. I'm glad they finally got through the rough draft, because now we have a really good game. Can't wait to try the other Exceed fighters.

What I wished UFS could have been. If you liked UFS you'll love Exceed. Only you will no longer have to chase rares and or break the bank. Simple. Portable. Fun. Lets hope that with future sets, they can add proprietary fighting games such as Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat again.

Rulebook foldout is unnecessary.  Seeing a couple turn flows and it is quite brilliant.  Very excited to play this against more people, namely some of my trash talking coworkers who think they're getting BattleCON down.

Inevitable comparisons - I can appreciate the plodding nature of BattleCON but Exceed is like Ruby Rhod, it pop Pop Pops!

Some of my favorite aspects: near-Absolute control over your movement.  Great moment w/Vincent vs. Nehtali.  Nehtali had 7 gauge and was prepping an ultra, Vincent had a good chunk of cards and 5 gauge, had Nehtali cornered, dumped a bunch to scootch back with 6 life left vs. Nehtali's 18.  Started card hunting to grab a key life gain and proceeded to pummel Nehtali after she spent a lot of cards to close the distance to be in range.

Complex game with some unusual mechanisms and some strategic options. This is normally the type of game I like but I struggled to get my head round it & I'm not sure I'll ever fully appreciate how to use the route markers successfully

Won in raffle at Conception convention quite a few years ago.  Seems to have been made as a prototype version and looks complex.  It's all a bit pale and doesn't capture the imagination.
To be fair I've never really given it a chance.  Must sit down and properly learn it at some point before trying it on my wife because it has some good reviews and people seem to like it.

RATING: 9
Excellent game with many options each turn. At first they look too daunting, but once you are familiar with the choices they offer many wasy to improve your position. Clever use of markers which have many uses ensures the game board is constantly changing, but in a controlled way. I would think a 2 player game will last about 60 minutes after players become aware of the options.

RATING: 7
A pick up and deliver game with a Hanseatic League setting that is ever popular with German designers.  
Route markers represent the prevailing winds and are there to make your travels less straightforward.  However, it is often possible to get where you want to at a cost.  Another complication is bidding for turn order and to replenish the goods in a city.  And then there is the Guild Master, who circulates around the cities, offering advantages to those who trade with him and ending the game after two complete circuits. Finally, a limited number of raids add some take-thatery that can be crucial in determining the winner. 

Turgid rules and poor production quality (at least for the first edition) detract from an involving game with some novel features.

{1 play • 4 players} Okay, it took a while to really "get" everything going on here - and I'm not entirely sure one play is enough to know - but I wasn't taken with this one.  It felt like Ad Acta but with boats and trading.  Very dry, very solitaire-y.  Wouldn't surprise me if my rating dropped after another play... but again, kind of a lot to take in intially, so maybe...

RATING: 7.5
Lots to think about and plan, almost too much.  May try easing the restriction of additionally requiring the correct numbered tile to build in a harbour as well as the other three commodity types, especially as you usually also have to plant this number to get to that harbour in the first place.  Frustration level is just a tad to high to want to play regularly but happy to play occasionally.  A clever, well worked design.

So much to like, so much to be puzzled over.

The hidden-semitrackable information bugs me. It's not trackable enough to justify keeping it open, and not hidden enough to not worry about it as a player.

With 4 players, it's very chaotic.

RATING: 9
Wow! What a tour de force by Andreas Steding! This is a game that initially is hard to grok, but once you understand how to drive it the game opens up and shows it's depth.

In it's essence, it is a pick-up and deliver/resource conversion game with an auction mechanic. The chits/route markers used for the game are multi-purposed and create interesting management situations where clever play with them dictate your outcome.

 The first player to reach five development points wins the game, but the game could also have an alternate ending which could occur prior to a player reaching that goal with different victory conditions needed for the win. 

Kogge has an eccentric design and gameplay that is opaque, deep, with plenty of  player interaction while maintaining low rules overhead. The game is tight, tense, has elegant and innovative mechanics, high replayability and plays in a relatively short time despite it's depth. Highly underrated and a hidden gem!

Es un juego ambientado en la Hansa del mar báltico. El objetivo es acabar el juego con mayor cantidad de puntos, que vienen dados por los materiales con los que acabas. Hay dos formas de ganar: conseguir sumar 5 entre oficinas contruidas y bonus obtenidos, (en cuyo caso gana inmediatamente el jugador que lo consigue) o ser el jugador que ha obtenido mercancías por mayor valor al finalizar el juego (cuando el maestre da dos vueltas al tablero).
Es un juego de comercio, que además incluye subastas y se pueden colocar rutas ocultas.. tiene detalles muy buenos. Las reglas son sencillas, pero tiene mucha profundidad. Altamente recomendable.

Los materiales son muy pobres. Hay P&Ps que tienen mejor pinta, pero no quita para que sea un euro clásico muy agradable de jugar.

RATING: 7
Brain burner! Lots of brain cell frying planning. An ingenious use of number tiles from 0 to 8.

I'm not a fan of Steding (I was bored by Norenberc, hated Hansa Teutonica, loathed Staufer Dynasty), but Kogge is a good one! However, the game is completely detached from its theme and it could have been about anything.

Egads, the networking. It shifts and writhes with player whim. This is awesome.

Egads, the set-collecting. The battles have side-effects in goods production. This is... possibly problematic? Players can set up a big haul in one city just because they desperately want to go early, which in turn looks like it might hand the game to the player who raids that city (and/or the player who then raids them). This ought to be fine if everyone realizes it? But I can't tell after one play.

Love that the tiles are many-use: initiative/production, opening offices, modifying travel routes.

RATING: 4
Overwrought with not enough payoff for the complexity.
This took most of the first game to understand even the basic strategies, but flows well once you get it. There's lots of interlinked mechanisms, parts that are used for many things and lots of choices to make. This all sounds great, but just when you think you've got something deep on your hands, out come the face down route markers. This, along with the tile draw, throws an incongruously random element across any strategic planning. I normally like my games with some luck thrown in. Or I like games which have lots of levels of thinking to come up with a strategy. But a game that encourages lots of thinking and then throws a highly random curveball at you? Blech.
Maybe if we played it with fewer players it would be better, but with four players it felt, in summary, that you weren't in control of your destiny. Instead you were bogged down in the back-office paper work of a logistics company run by lunatics from the land of Randomarama.

RATING: 4
There are some clever mechanics to be found here, especially the use of travel chits in different functions (change board layout, exchange for piracy chip, bidding, production), and for the layman this can become quite daunting at first glance. But with repeated playing there comes a moment of "what's the point?", as the game reveals itself to be a rather dry accountant's exercise. The use of the "raid" chips can have very unfair results if players ship's are raided, and there is not really a lot once can do to prevent this. Players attacked twice in this way are practically out of the game, and the oppurtunities for kingmaking are ample. Somehow not my cup of tea because of it's dryness, but others might like it more.

RATING: 5.5
First play was a crushing disappointment that made me want to throw all my games away.  I tried to teach it and flopped spectacularly, making me wonder why I had a collection of games that I can't get anyone else to enjoy.

I don't quite yet get why this ruleset is so hard to memorize.  It's not a terribly complex game, but it does have a lot of small rules and unintuitive play.  Take the advice of the BGG raterati - do not think you can just pick this up from reading the rules.  I had to solo it week after week to keep the rules in my mind, then I stopped for a while and when it came out, I could hardly remember any of it - and I had never figured out the flow of play and objectives.  

I need another play to have any idea what to make of it.  It seemed to go too fast, but surely would be more welcome with players who understand what's going on.  Other complaints - needs a draw bag, and seems like it should have screens.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
My 1st edition copy has a terrible rules set (the preparation part is very badly written) but once we struggled through the first round, it all made good sense. Hidden under the rules is a really interesting game. Players move their ship from Baltic port to port, swapping goods and trying to build trading houses. You can rob a player or city once unless you buy a 2nd raid marker, and there is an independent piece you can also trade with. All familiar stuff, until you understand the route markers. These are used in several ways, for directing routes between cities (crucial), for bidding for turn order (very important) and for building trading houses (vital). You spend route markers during the game, and you can buy a pair from a face up selection each turn. The game has two ways to finish and it's only at the end you might figure out the winner. If you like games where you must plan ahead, and bid higher to make sure you can effect your plans, then you'll enjoy Kogge.

With improved graphic design, a better rules set, a tweak here and there, this could be a top rate Alea or HiG game. As it is, you might think it too much work and pass it over. But I think there's a classic little game lurking here, just waiting for a professional polisher. With that polish, I'd give it 8 or 9, but as is, 7.5. *** Played again, still got a rule wrong (the second warehouse needs two chits of that city). There is a good game here, struggling under bad graphics and too many rules. Needs editing and it would be a cult favourite.

Kogge offer couple of interesting ideas and many chances to plan your game to the future rounds. BUT unfortunately there is one big problem, which is also the reason why I sold a copy of mine: downtime. If it is not your turn, there is a very little to do. And when it's your turn you really feel the pressure, where other guys are "humming" and waiting their turn. I need "more action" all the time and Kogge doesn't give me that.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Twas not a great first impression for all of us although there were interesting aspects to the game.  The navigation aspect was tricky and potentially changing with each person's turn which made planning ahead very difficult.  Also, the raids were not well appreciated although the part where one could not return to that site was an interesting twist.  I wanted to like this one more than I did - kind of want to play again but it would have to be a different group!  :-)

RATING: 7
[b][thing=8138][/thing][/b] is fascinating though I'm not convinced that I'd want to play it all that much even if I could track down a copy.  I think there's a high degree of luck/randomness in this one when it comes to what chits come out of the bag every round and how they are grouped, which could get frustrating fast.

Kogge. I am at a loss. I am trying to come to terms with the fact that Kogge not only classifies as a game, but that a certain subsection of society (who really ought to be spending their free time under strict supervision) actually get some enjoyment out of playing it. Bewildering. I was left floundering during my two hour experience, two hours of fumbling around, blindly attempting to decipher what I was supposed to be doing. Two hours of utter grim despair, wondering how to associate the theme with the concepts of gameplay. The theme, oh the theme. It is not so much pasted on as affixed with a dab of spittle and a healthy dosage of prayer. I could relate nothing to anything, as events developed and oh wait, after 20 minutes of twiddling my thumbs it was my turn again. An attempt to make a move that would advance my position would be forthcoming but rarely was I aware of the impact. Did I mention this game was dry by the way? Dryer than the hair of someone who has stood directly in the path of a jet engine for a thousand jahre. And the clock ticked on. And my will to live was sapped. I understand that in the business this kind of game is referred to as a 'brain burner'. It was not so much my brain that was on fire by 11pm, rather my fevered imagination, picturing every copy of Trade on Jerky Seas going up in smoke, thus denying the unsuspecting board gamer the prospect of accidentally taking part in a game, ever again. There was a time that when I wanted to bemuse non-gamers with the utter ridiculousness of board gaming, I would mention that the other week I spent a good portion of my Tuesday evening playing Canal Mania. CANAL MANIA EVERYBODY! Because who doesn't get manic at the merest mention of a canal? Well, Canal Mania has been usurped in the order of games that I have played which I could never hope to explain to my mother the concept of someone voluntarily committing valuable hours of their life to. Kogge. Truly unfathomable.

Wow.  This is a really fine game.  I'm a big fan of pick up and deliver games and this one is outstanding.  The only thing missing right out of the box are some player screens but that is easily remedied.  Deliciously tough decisions on every turn.  Raid!

RATING: 9
Andreas Steding’s most known game is Hansa Teutonica, but in my opinion his Kogge is a much better game.

Kogge is more unique than original. A brilliant design. Simple rules, deep as the ocean. Also as opaque as the mysteries at the bottom of the ocean: try to calculate how to win at this game. If you are serious, even if you are not inclined to AP, you may go in a never-ending loop. So is this a disaster of a game, a cold game of calculation? It is the opposite, since it is virtually impossible to calculate how to win. Actually in the first games I have played I didn't even know the direction, what in other games is given for granted... go there, there you obstacle the opponent so, you know paths and you choose the best between many paths... this is how we reason in other games, we know what we are doing. Not here. Here even the paths, the directions are obscure. Here intuition is the only weapon we have. Because every single move has repercussions that change everything. At a certain point one stops thinking as we normally do in normal games, and we discover that to play this beast we need a completely different set of abilities, nothing I have experienced before. This is not a normal game, for sure.

So Kogge has minimal rules and it is deep at the same moment and original. That’s all? No, there is more. One of the reasons people don’t like Hansa Teutonica is that it appears to be cold. At least is appears cold to me. I find even the interaction present in Hansa Teutonica a bit cold. As in other optimization games, this happens to other games too, not only with Hansa Teutonica. And Kogge? Kogge is not only highly interactive (you have to look at what the opponents are doing and react or you don’t have any chance to win, and ruining others’ plans MUST be part of your strategy, as far as I have understood), but it is a FUN interaction, in the literal sense of the word “fun”. As an example I cite that you can steal from an opponent or from a city and then you are banned from that city. This is never nice for the victims, but I have never resented when I was the victim, because... because the game is structured that even if it really seems a simulation of a difficult time in travelling on sea, it is actually fun, very fun to play.

So, after reading this, look at the rating of Kogge on BGG. Not only at the rank, that could be low because there are too few votes, but at the average rating itself. It makes me so sad, below 7. WHY? There are many explanations. Kogge is not an easy game to approach. You don’t need to be a heavy gamer to play it, I think one can play this game without going too deep in the analysis of the game, so playing it lightly. You may have even to stop calculating in order to win (because the only effect of calculation in this game seems to be that it distracts you from doing the simple intuitive things you have to do to win :-) ). I have won most of the games I have played till now, but the only one in which I really started understanding how to win was the last in which I stopped calculating deeply, and instead formulated  a simple plan in my mind, like be patient, do not rush, grow slowly. So the game can be played without calculation: choose a strategy, and react to what others are doing. But I started seeing this at my fourth game, before the game was frightening in its opacity. So this is the first reason Kogge is not appreciated: it has been played very little, even by people that own it, because Kogge is not a friendly fellow at the first meetings. Then add these other points: it was produced by a small company; graphics is quite old fashioned and not really beautiful; the rules themselves are not explained so well (the German rules and the English rules are both wrong in some points, but they compensate at least, mistakes are not in the same points). So, add all this together, and you have the perfect recipe to make of a masterpiece like Kogge an almost unknown game on BGG.

But this does make me sad. I hope one day this game will be published again, maybe by a big publisher. It deserves it. And the players deserve to play this game.

I have played Kogge only 4 times at the moment I am writing this comment (but I have already planned with friends more games!) and so I give now a provisional rating of 9, I want to see how it is with more plays before thinking to give it a 10. But my gut feeling is that this game is one of those (rare) games that become better the more we play them, and more interesting (vs. becoming boring, as it usually happens with games that tire us after a while), because subtle strategies not noticed at the beginning appear on the surface, as gifts to people that dared deepen the friendship with it. So my rating can still become a 10. But already now, I shout this: I RECOMMEND THIS GAME!

Trade on jerky seas. Though the production isn't of the highest standard, Kogge has a good looking board and pieces (though I doubt they'll hold up to sustained play). The fact that you need to plan several turns ahead and the wealth of (limited) choices on your turn means the game is prone to over analysis and long periods of downtime. I can live with some downtime, but coupled with a few rules which can completely destroy your plans (when the room for error is very small), very little player interaction and a poorly implemented theme means this game becomes frustrating and dull. This is a shame as it has some really interesting mechanisms that cry out to be used in a better game.

I really love [thing=43015][/thing], [thing=75449][/thing] and [thing=166226][/thing]. I wish I could love this too. There's absolutely something wonderful here, but after 2 plays I have to admit to myself that I'm never going to be able to get an intuitive sense of how to play this game smoothly.

Essentially, the game revolves around the concept that there are different ports, which each have a number associated with them, and a type of goods they produce. Ports want other types of goods, so in a typical way, you sail around the board delivering goods of other colors to the ports.

Here's where things get nuts. Each port has two slots. In each slot, a route token gets placed. The route tokens have numbers matching the city to which that route leads. One of the player actions is to swap a route token from the board with one from their hand, but the one they place down gets added face down, so only that player knows where it goes.  Other players can still choose to use it for movement, but they can only guess where it leads.

The route tokens are also used for other things. You need 1 or 2 of them matching the city you are in to build a house in that city. Not only that, you have to use them each round to bid with, in order to get a good turn order number, which is what will let you get more good route tokens from the display, and which is what will let you carry out your plans before someone else beats you to the city with all the juicy goods.

Even the goods are incredibly tight. When you reach a city you can trade with that city, so for every good you give the city, you can get 2 goods that don't match the good you sold. Each city only produces one type of good, AND they only generate NEW goods when a player used route markers matching that city as part of their turn order bid! Not only that the goods are needed in large sets of 6 to unlock new abilities and goods are needed in different colored sets to construct houses in addition to discarding the route markers matching the city.

This game DEMANDS you plan several turns in advance, and then throws a lot of things at you that might disrupt your plans. For my brain, the things it throws are just one too many, and I can tell you which specific one that I think takes this from a game I'm compelled to master to a game that I don't want to bother with anymore. That one is the raid action. If you are in a city with another player you can drop your raid token in that city, (which at most, you only ever get 2 of, but with 4 players, that's still a lot of potential raiding). When you do this the target player divides their goods into 2 groups, and you choose and take one of those groups.

There are detriments to doing this. The attacking player loses 10 points per raid token they used, if the game comes down to points in the end (there are 2 victory conditions). The attacking player also may never visit that city again, which can be trouble. It also accelerates the game clock. That being said, when a game that demands you plan as much as this one does incorporates a way for players to directly ruin the process of a single player like that, it feels just a little too harsh. I don't mind this sort of mechanism in a lighter, more tactical game. It's just here, where you need to be keeping track of so many ever-shifting elements, it just feels bad.

Now, I understand the reason for this. The goods are available in different quantities, and are limited. The designer needed a way to prevent one player from grabbing up all of one type of good, and holding it, thereby making it impossible for anyone to build new houses. I see the need for some mechanism to solve this, but it doesn't change the fact that when you lose up to three very carefully planned turns of setup to a take-that punch that undoes all your work, it feels bad on the game, or at least, this pvp combat is the one-too-many variable factors that can get in the way of your plans, that makes this game feel too complicated for me. If it was easier to line up a good move, I might not mind this.

I so wanted to like this game. I like the concept that your bidding counters also determine where new resources appear and can determine which routes connect cities together.

However, the execution leaves a lot to be desired. It's a typical resource management game: Move here, get this cube and that cube, then spend it for points. In most games of this type, if an opponent, the luck of the draw, or even yourself screw your plans up, you can typically recover. In this one, you are totally, totally screwed. You work so hard to get one measly cube and you find out you can't spend it. But because those bidding counters are used for so many things, resources are frustratingly way too tight. So there are situations where you literally could do nothing but suffer.

I want to try this one more time in hopes that this would become a "gem" but I'm not keeping my hopes up.

I was a bit too tired to play this properly, but through the sleep deprivation I began to grasp the game and upon later review, I found it good. I'd still need to play it more to be certain about the score.

A terrific game! Plays well, within 1 1/2 h. with 4 people. Trading with the guild master often leads to victory. Rules are not clearly written, English rules clearify German rules, vice versa. The multiple use of the trade markers is a great aspect of the game. Use the blind markers to 'secure' your future route to a city, the route cannot be changed unless another player travelled by it, and the marker is face up again. We incorporated one 'advanced' rule that works very well: the guild master collects taxes in the town he ends (1 good from a player with a 'kogge' there), and disposes collected goods in the town that that particular town does NOT produce. This way, you definitely want to be start player if you yourself are one or two cities away from te guild master, want to 'land' it in a city of an opposing player, or if you want to clear a city from its 'foreign' goods to deny it to an other player. Played it with several different people, men and women, and they all liked it!

A superb trading game of great depth and subtlety. One of my favourites. I would certainly rate it a 9 (although as I have an interest in JKLM Games, I haven't actually done so).

This little gem is an amazing logistical and resource management game.

--Aug2011-- After one play, I can see I played quite badly - but whether I learned enough to give it a reasonable show the next time out (and I do indeed hope there is a [i]next time out[/i]) is still unknown.  It's a fascinatingly opaque thing.

The rules and components make this game look deceptively simple. Yet gameplay is rich with many layers intermeshing. The theme is the usual run of the mill German trading variety. Players are moving their Kogge (trade vessels) around Hansatic cities trying to establish offices, acquire and trade goods.

There's an interesting use of numbered chits which drive movement, goods production and bidding for turn order. It's all very overwhelming with lots of options (trade, raid players, raid ports, movement, bidding, etc). Will need further plays to cement a rating.

2nd Edition.Components are ok. Laser printer and home made (almost). The bits inside are ok but the box is shockingly bad. The cover is peeling off the box.

By reading the rules, you wouldn't know that this was released by a British company.  For some reason I found this very difficult to wrap my head around.  Once, we figured it out, everything seems straight forward and in place and I feel that I can now explain it.

As far as quality goes, it is dubious at best.  Which is rather sad as this game is terrific.  The board to the new version is lovely though, and the art and the bits are entirely functional.  

The game itself is tough, it is hard to gauge what your best moves are as everthing you do is interlaced, but this leads to a number of wonderful choices.  This game will be on the top of my replay list for quite some time.

A bit disapointing. When I first looked at it I thought it could be a terrific, tense game with lots of dificult choices and serious interaction. Well, it came out to be nothing like it. It has some flaws, the production is like it has been home made, and I'm almost sure that it will be much more interesting with some variants or home rules.

It's ugly and the components are bad but the mechanics are interesting. The game is quite confusing first but it's a good trading game that would need a reprint with better quality components.

Confusing during first play, however due to huge downtime issues (possibly linked to first play) I cannot see it ever being played again.  Some good ideas, but with 4 of you the downtime and lack of ability to plan too far ahead prevents this being a game I would like to try again.

This game is the textbook definition of hidden gem.

There's not many moving parts, but they combine and overlap in interesting ways to create a true brain burner. The different uses for the route tokens make for lots of tough decisions, and timing (of your raid, for example) is critical.

A truly special game- I wish this had a wider release.

Ecplained by Markus of JKLM.
It took me about half of the game to get the rather unusual way of playing (your tiles are your money, but also determine your destination)
Would like to play this again.

I really enjoyed this one.  A nice, middle weight trading/development game.  The use of "route markers" for so many different purposes creates an interesting management dynamic, because you are constantly trading, buying and using them to control where you can go and build.  Lots of options on each turn makes it a game that takes a bit of time to wrap your head around, but once you do, it's well worth it.  Should really come in around its 70 minute estimated playing time once you understand the game.

Didn't like this as much as City and Guilds.  Maybe I need to play it more, or with more than two, but I didn't think it was that great.

The strategic level definitive game about the Great War.

RATING: 3
Decent sim but completely negated by fictional geography.  Rail lines moved, forests transplanted to make the game work - even the map scale changes throughout the map.  A major pet peeve of mine - destroys the value of the sim.  Fix the system - don't fictionalize the world.  That's what Euros are for.

Also, a classic "kitchen sink" design.  Could use more than a little dose of abstraction.  An interesting system is buried amongst the piles of chrome and fictional Europe.

Unplayable, it took a multiplayer team a year to play the first 3 montsh of the war....

First impressions: WOW!!!

This is looking like the definitive game for WW1. So far what's caught my eye is the naval system, plus the global scope - this really does represent the first WORLD war!

If you have this but have not played it, or if you are thinking of getting it, be prepared to devote huge amounts of time in order to receive anything worthwhile in return.  I would love to know how many owners of LGG began a campaign game (1914-1918), only to quit somewhere along the way.  The only positive thing one might say about the English-language rulebooks--there are four of them, plus "play-aids" out the ying-yang--is that they . . . are in English; otherwise, they are almost worthless.  Yet, when one begins to see the pieces ever so slowly fit together (even while one's hair falls out), and the light begins to shine (even while it dims in what you once knew as your "sanity"), there is a certain satisfaction which comes from playing the bloody thing.  To set-up LGG, to play LGG, is to see eternity open before your eyes.

One of my favorite.
A complex monster game on first world war.
The best that i know, every aspect of this terrible struggle is simulated, from trench warfare, to diplomacy technological research, the mood of the different parliament...russian revolution etc etc etc
If u like monster games buy it (the english version)

I generally don't mind involved, but this is more than I like--and much of it is of dubious historicity.

RATING: 9
It's a monster wargame with a lot of possibilities but with the worst explained manual I've ever seen. It's the best simulation of the great war but requires a lot of home modifications to some components and rules to make it well playable. 

The high rating is after a lot of modifications, clarifications and personal work are applied, without them it drops to 6. 

It's also dissapointing that Azure Wish and the designers of their games give ZERO support to the players, I'll never buy any more games from them after this one.

Its clunky as hell but the scope of the game is immense and for the amount of stuff the game covers I think it can only be considered streamline.  Its the best treatment of WWI grand strategy out there.  Makes Paths of Glory an abstract game in comparison.  Too bad AWE went out of business because it was a company with visionary games.

RATING: 3
Poorly written (or translated?) rules in English version. Resource allocation for the Central Powers is wonky--often causing collapse in mid-1916. Kitchen-sink design with poor rules set make this one a bear to learn and the flawed design makes it a questionable effort at best.

RATING: 7.1
Put together a BIG BOOK LGG playaid, a 46 page FAQ (from questions on CSW and BGG) and numerous other LGG playaids. All on the Consimworld LGG discussion board in the header section.

Have begun first game after a LGG bootcamp earlier this summer. THIS is a beast of game; you need a dungeon master to guide you on your journey.

Glad we were able to have THE LGG dungeon master, Cory H., help guide us thru the heart of darkness. It takes a HUGE commitment from hardcore wargamers. We spent hours just kitting the game out (see my AARs) and putting together all the rules, errata, FAQ, etc. So far, it has been worth the effort...I think. A total role playing immersion/experiential game. No idea how to spin dials or pull levers (there are a bazillion of each) to actually "win". But, who cares as long as you are playing with a great group of wargaming mates?

Rating after two sessions: a 10 for effort, 4 for execution...so a 7 seems about right. There are some great design dynamics contained: political flexibility a function of national will - and the entire national will chart. Very cool. Also, rating generals for obstinacy is brilliant - and then that rating determines the number of times you must attack - regardless of the success/failure in a battle. On the downside, this is a true sandbox/everything thrown in wargame. Some chrome has a little detail and some has a BUNCH. No rhyme or reason that I can discern regarding design choices ("Why this personality included and not that one? Or, why this micro scale dynamic, while another game dynamic is at a such a macro scale?"). Many unclear items in the rules; you'll have to talk it/dice it out when in doubt.

Although I rated game weight a 5, it's not really that complex. The rating represents the immense barrier to entry. Basic wargaming blocking and tackling not here: no hex numbers, no map legend, no useable reference charts that clarifies much rules wordage, definitions, index, etc. 

The rules need a HUGE rewrite. The rules were ported from french into english which may explain some of the ambiguity (although the translation was pretty decent). And, it's the opposite of a Greenwood Avalon Hill precision in the rule writing. Different terms used for the same thing, terms not defined, loose terms, etc.

Anyways, the learning barrier to play this game may be massive, but, I think, just maybe, the game can be conquered and will be worth the trouble. Time will tell, but, I remain hopeful. The amount of game/content here is so immense, I just couldn't avoid the challenge.

RATING: 9
A fabulous game, as comprehensive a view of WW1 as is possible to imagine.  Its very completeness makes the prospect of a full campaign game daunting, though.  I've played only scenarios, which all gave the authentic feel of the war.  If you're into super-detailed rules and high simulation value, get this one.  I rate it 9 rather than 10 only because of the length and a few rules niggles.

Generally too much procedure, unclear rules and too un-ergonomical components for what it tries to do. In particular, the combat system is much too heavy for what is in essence "match units, roll on differential CRT".

The global (per country) pool of replacements always available everywhere makes all lines impenetrable until the pool runs out, and then all lines for that country crumble at the slightest nudge.

A decent game on WW1, lurking behind the piles of rule section.  The French is just not disciplined enough to speak what they want in a simple but concise words.  But then, the French's map and ocunters are always better in asethetic terms.  The number of "10"s here is a force to reckon with...

The Definitive simulation of WWI. Aside the quibbles with the map (who IMHO are more linked to the strategic scale and to the "abstarction" of certain mechanics at this scale) this is is most cohomprensive game on WWI around here. The inclusion of the naval war and of the war in the colonies add a whole new dimension to the game. In addition the mechanic of the big offensive is really nice and put the player in the boots of the generals on the western front (and you have always the mirage of the green fields beyond...)

RATING: 8.5
An intensive monster war-game in a deceptively small box, considering the game's scope.  Components are colorful and well done.  Playable in small bites yet a full blown campaign game is possible.  Strategic level details with layered tactical elements.  A long game to play giving players many things to do in a turn.  The ultimate World War One game but not for the faint of heart.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Absolutely breathtaking in both scope and content. Literally, anything you thought a country should do or not do in WWI, you can do (or not do) here. Of course, a game of this scope is going to be an intense undertaking and that is certainly true here. You think ASL is immersive? OCS? Fighting Wings? Forget it. They don't hold a candle to this one. There is no other way to describe this one but to say it is a beast. However, I can't think of another WWI game that allows you to "play with the levers of history" like this one does.

RATING: 7
The definitive WWI simulation. All in there, from small scenarios to the big one. Be careful to buy the English edition rules (they include all errata).

Update: after having played Death in the Trenches, I have to lower my rating as LGG is simply too much. The definitive WWI game for me now is Death in the Trenches.

Ya know, this looks like it could easily be the best WWI game ever made, and I'd absolutely LOVE to play it, but I'll never be able to swing the %u20AC300 - $500 price!  What kind of person pays $500 for a board game?  Shit, if you're that rich, why not simply hire re-enactors and shout out your orders to 'em?  Jeez-loweez.

RATING: 6
A WWI simulation that incorporats all elements of the conflict. The idea is great, but the execution is somewhat flawed. The system encourages somewhat gamey tactics and the outcome is often very unhistorical. I guess its an ok game but I there are far better games to invest your time in than this monster.

Dans l'idéal, exactement ce que j'attends d'un wargame stratégique : règles politiques, diplomatiques, évolution technologique, tactique et opérationnelle. Tout y est. Qui embrasse trop mal étreint ? peut-être mais en affinant les règles on obtient un jeu jouable.

A game for group of gamers. As we're only two players in the city I live in I sold it, bought Paths of Glory and we had a lot of fun.
Nevertheless playing this game with 4-5 others players must be a great moment.

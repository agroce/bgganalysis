GAME: Around the World in 80 Days
RANK: 1303
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very well balanced, scales reasonably well 4-6 players, plays quickly and is good fun. I'd say it's at the same level as Ticket to Ride - a fair bit of luck along the way but there are enough tricky decisions to make it interesting.

RATING: 6
Very light racing game with some set collection and a tried and true theme.

The game involves collecting the appropriate travel cards (trains and/or boats) to move sequentially from destination to destination around the world.  Your goal is to be the one who reaches London in the fewest number of days (and of course not be the last person to reach London).  When you select a travel card you also select a corresponding action (gain a coin, move the detective, use the balloon, gain an event card, become start player, etc.) so this also influences your card selection choice.  There are some little tricks and bonuses along the way, such as combining two cards of the same value for a shorter trip, using gold to buy more cards and therefore have more options, and moving the detective around the give people extra time (you want to have the least time).  The event cards are a bit swingy as most are good, but not all are balanced, and there are a couple of complete screwjob cards bad for everyone (and obviously very bad for the person who wasted their time gaining one).  You also get little bonuses for arriving early at destinations, again such as a coin, a card etc.

Overall, a nice short, simple to play game, well designed but very light and definitely NOT deserving of any gamer awards (DSP, IGA), but since the SdJ only rewards games for simpletons, then yes this would be a very good choice for that award.  That's not to say its a bad game, just a very, very light game.  And very important: this game plays 2-PLAYERS, its officially in the rules (not on the box or the BGG page for some reason), and its works just fine with 2.

Losing interest in the game.  Not sure why, but just have not enjoyed my previous plays of it, though it is still a good 6P game which it is not too common.

Gorgeous map.  Fun light game.  would most likely be an 8 except the art is that awesome.  But if you pull it off the shelf knowing its  a light game, its definitely a 10.  Mechanically, I'd say this and TTR have that "it" elegance that I find lacking in Thebes and Thurn & Taxis (respectively).

RATING: 7
Light, fun and full of twists and turns.  It is more luck based than TtR (to which it is often compared) but also more edgy and not as linear.  I enjoy this game very much - mainly for the theme's integration into the mechanics - but it is not in the very top rank of light/family games.

There are lots of interesting mechanics - the Detective to stymie others, the need to go first sometimes (and the consequent need not to go last), the risk of picking up an event card and finding it's a blue one, needing not to be last to finish no matter how quickly you're completing the individual legs, the decision of whether to roll the die again with a balloon card.  

It's a nice game and one that will have lots of replay value and be useful to play with a family growing up as well as with adults.

RATING: 7
Fairly light family game. Nice theme and an interesting use of essentially two different and opposing scoring tracks. You need to get your pawn to London quickly but you need to keep the number of days as few as possible. There's always the trade-off do you go for quicker pawn movement or hold up your pawn to try to move between the cities in the least number of days.

No rating here because no play. That was because of something in the rules. The box says 3-6 (BGG says 2-6) but the rule books lists a 2 play variant. Okay. That is confusing to start with. But we love the theme and wanted to try. Then we read  the two player rules which basically tell you that if a player falls more than a location behind in the game that player is unlikely to win. And that sealed its "For Trade" status very quickly.

RATING: 6.5
{2 plays, 5 & 6 players} I like the idea of it, but was kinda disappointed, even though I once made it around in only 60 days.  Ultimately, I thought there was too little fun and/or not enough depth (you'd kind of like more of one if you have less of the other).  And it also felt kind of solitaire-y.  Not what you want from a light family game.

*** UPDATE ***

Bumped up my initial 5 rating after more play.  There's still not a lot of depth, and I wish the hang-back strategy worked better (with bonuses for being first to cities, there's really no reason not to just sprint, well, unless your cards are amazingly bad), but I feel the fun now and can see playing this once or twice a year, especially (with 6 players) if everyone's playing quickly (or someone is wrangling them).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A light, clever travel game that is actually a game. Seems a bit simplistic, but it has some interesting mechanisms; choose-a-card is especially clever, since a special action on the board's edge is chosen along with it, and you may really want the card but a different action, or vice-versa.

Since you're trying to get to the finish line the most efficiently (and not the fastest), you're not in a big hurry to move. This can lead to a conspiracy of sorts between the two players in last place, since the rules stipulate that the last player automatically loses if he fails to reach London in the same turn as the second to last player. 

The game plays easy and exposes Transamerica and Ticket to Ride as the vacuous non-games they are.

This is a neat niche game since it fills in as a 'meaty' filler.  Players compete to race around the globe in the shortest period of time.  The game has a neat mechanic that separates the score (time to complete) from the player's location.  Thus it is possible to be the first to physically get back to London, but not be the quickest to do so.  This combines with rewards for the first and last player to reach a location to create a neat little twist.  Keep the game light, fun, moving along and in the spirit of its namesake for the best play experience.  [GTI: TPCL]

Egyelőre csak 2 fős tesztjáték volt, kb. 20 perc alatt lement, a kis pontszám lehet hogy annak szól, hogy nem az igazi ketten. Alapvetően jópofa, de vannak teszteletlen részek, vagy egyszerűen csak nem kellett volna erőltetni a 2 fős verziót a szerzőnek? Az utazgatós rész nagyon egyszerű, az akció azért visz bele némi színt, és az eseménykártyák is kellenek be, még így is bőven családi játék, egyszerű a néhány kivétel ellenére is. A detektív egy kis kinfliktust is rak bele. A 2 kék eseménykártya viszont szerintem felesleges szerencsefaktor. Ami pedig kifejezetten nem tetszett, hogy szinte végig lehet rohanni, minden körben haladtunk egy állomást, és az veszített, akinek ez egyszer nem sikerült, mert nem jött neki megfelelő járműkártya. Hiába volt 20 napnyi előnye, veszített! Oké, tudom amire rá van nyomva a családi cimke, annak ilyesmit el kell nézni, de nem a mi stílusunk:) Igazából csak azért van nálunk a játék, mert egyik barátom gyerekének majd meg kell tanítani.
Több játékosnál jobb lehet ez a játék vége dolog, mert ott a kevesebb nappal akkor is nyerhet valaki, ha több körrel később ér be. Mondom valószínűleg csak két főnél van bénán megoldva. Összességében: nem nagy durranás, de elmegy családinak.
---
Na 5-en azért sokkal jobb volt, van némi taktikai lehetőség, de azért lehetne több kihatásunk is az eredményre. Kisgyerek nagyon élvezte, egyébként vegyes volt a fogadtatás.

A few too many rules for its own good, and while they may be necessary to create a narrative, they are also a pain to review and teach. The layout of the rule book does not help. Playing well in Around the World means doing things like knowing when and when to draw one of those damn event cards, to stay in one spot and to use money, all of which feel a little too calculated for a race game.

Has the dubious honour of being the only game I have ever thrown in my life. It was that, or finding a sharp knife, and then getting seriously violent with it. And since it wasn't my game... 

The idea of racing along 2 parallel victory tracks sounded like a great idea. And I quite enjoy a bit of chaos, and thoroughly enjoy hand management that allows you to get creative and do nifty things. I love the setting, and am fond of quirky race games. What could possible go wrong?

A couple of turns later, clouds started to close in rapidly. There seemed to be a very scripted, and linear, optimum route through the game, and no amount of getting clever with cards was going to open up a viable alternative route, or even trump existing short-cuts that were only available to those lucky enough to draw the golden-key. Someone had dressed up the [gameid=2785] and put in a Trojan Horse Kosmos box, and smuggled it into my living room. Land here, roll six and go 12 forwards, or skip a turn. With that sort of obstacle tackling all over the board, at least with a clean die-roll you know where you stand, and what level of challenges and enjoyment you can expect from a game. Pot luck, clean, family fun.

But when a designer cloaks completely arbitrary progress requirements in a foggy card mechanism that creates the illusion of complicated alternative route considerations and intricate movement decisions ahead, and all it crashes into into the end, is the butt of a bloody elephant at the halfway mark, then 80 days to London is indeed 81 days too long.

And it kept dragging on until the will to live started to sap out of me. A game of snakes and ladders where people spend ages staring at the board, desperately trying to spot [i]any[/i] location where their hand can lead to semi-meaningful decision, only realizing that that also requires other players to be in certain locations, a factor over which you have no real influence. Pot luck with AP, my favourite.

Whatever meaningful decisions are being made (and on a linear obstacle track, they are nigh identical to everyone playing, give or take a turn depending on race position), the little skill in the game is floored by overbearing random factors. It didn't have to be that way, but the designer all but guaranteed, that there is no getting away from it here.

It got to the stage where I realized that I could at least set the target on one of the two race tracks, if I dashed forwards to London, giving up all hopes of winning in the process, as all other people would then be able to calculate (ad infinitum, turn by turn) how to get a better end-score than mine, since one of the two target-numbers was finally clearly defined.

I don't think I have ever before raced away at the head of the field with the clear goal to become last, and get this slow-death-through-a-thousand-cuts game over with, as quickly as possible. That, to do that, I had to be the first player across the finish line, was surreal to say the least. And to be frank, the only redeeming feature I can find in this production.

The underlying ideas are interesting, but the game itself is shambolic, and in a Kosmos jacket, a complete let-down for people like me. That might be the key though. Maybe it is an early sign that Kosmos is starting to target an audience on the lower end of the expectations scale. Kosmos games, typically, and up until now, have been appealing to both the family market, and the gamer's one, and that cross-over appeal had been a pillar of the company's success. To me it looks like a first sign they are starting to hunt for an expansion to their current market, and this title is pitched at those who are more easily swayed by tie-ins and familiar themes. Maybe, in the German market, that still means that somewhere in the box, there has to be at least the idea for a half-decent game in there. I suspect that the UK approach of sticking a dreadful roll-and-move title in a Harry Potter or Teletubbies coat would be a total non-starter in a market whose base-expectations will be a bit more refined. Unfortunately for me, it has also meant that the alarm bells didn't ring early enough, and this turkey actually made it onto my table.

Once.

I now keep a sharp knife close, just in case.   

And it will be interesting to see in which direction their 2-player line is heading too. I fear the "nice game for the kids in the back of the car on the family holiday title" is just a few fairs away.

Perhaps it's the pacing of most books, but I have found that books seem to translate better into board games than most other forms of media. Such is the case with Around the World in 80 days. In this game, based upon the truly great story, all the players get to take on the role of Phileas Fogg and attempt to make the fastest trip around the world.  It's a unique concept, and I like that they didn't even try to resolve the "who gets to be Phileas?" debate, and they just let everyone. 

What I like about the game is that there is this crazy time tracker thing that shows how many days of your journey you have used up. So slowly the players create some kind of paradox as they arrive in a city multiple turns before their opponents and yet the opponents can still arrive sooner. Now despite how confusing that might seem, this game is really straightforward. The first time we played the rules took a very short amount of time to learn. Some of my geek buddies have even implied that this game was a perfect fit for the SdJ award in the year it was published. While I can't really speak out against the real winner, I can speak up for this game that did not make the cut. It is a fast fun game that deserves a spot on any family's game shelf.

This is an excellent race game, IMO, that rewards intelligent use of cards.  The timing mechanism is excellent, as the person who reaches London first (by turns) is not necessarily the winner.  the winner is determined by the number of days it takes each player to get there, but everyone only has 80 days to spend.  If it takes longer than that, you lose!

Update: Mar 2012 - We haven't played this lately and although I was loath to give it up I incorporated it as part of a trade for Mr. Jack, Long Shot and Cafe International.  We'll see if that was a good decision.

However clueless eurogames usually go, Around the World in 80 Days goes even further and makes for one of the silliest games I’ve ever played: its card-driven gameplay is disarming and makes even less sense than the typical and annoying wooden cubes exploitation euros are unable to go beyond.

In its core Around the World isn’t a race among the players but a struggle between the individual player and the game itself, in the vain attempt to get that lucky cards combo that allows him to go from a location to the next in a somewhat less disastrous way: yet nonsensical rules such as the oppressive and illogical limit of cards in hand (set to only six), the few recurring event cards making almost useless any other useful event card already in hand (by requiring all the cards, even the drawn ones, to be reshuffled) and the consequent impossibility to move more than one location per turn strip this game of any playing pleasure and wish of even seeing it again.

As a gateway game, this is phenomenal. Easy to teach, can be fully understood in under 5 minutes even by non-gamers, with enough depth to satisfy most Eurogamers...for a few games, at least. There isn't much in the way of long term strategy, and a turn typically consists of a couple of meaningful but simple decisions. You can play a bit more cutthroat and try to foil the other player's plans, but doing that too much doesn't seem to be a winning strategy. With 300 or so games in my collection, this isn't something that I'd choose to play on a consistent basis, but it's great for when company is over and for the kid's gamenights I run.
Very surprised at how unknown this game is, considering what a gem it is for a gateway game.

RATING: 5
Fairly simple hand management game.  Luck heavy from 2 card decks and die rolls.  The board movement feels too linear... there is only one parallel path so everyone is collecting almost the exact same cards in the same order (offset by a turn or two).  Okay for families and casual gamers, but it leaves a lot to be desired.  Reasonable with 4p; could be chaotic with 5-6p.

RATING: 6
Good introductory game, or a light game to wind down at the end of the evening.

Scales well, but I think it is better with more (as you have more options) - interesting layer of time/race, do you race ahead on the board but spend more time or move more slowly but spend less?

Sounds complicated but it isn't at all in practice :)

I don't know if it is just me, since this game is not rated that badly.  However, I played this once with my wife and it felt like it had no depth.  It may be that it would play better with more people, but I doubt that it will make it to the table again... there are just too many better games to choose from.

RATING: 9
Nicely done. A little more challenging than one might expect, with choosing the proper action each turn necessary to get the edge on the others in this interesting race game. UPDATE: Do not underestimate the importance of tactical decision-making in this game. Deciding to travel or stay another turn in a city can be important, no matter one's status on the day record track. Secondly, one must plan ahead when choosing the event for the current turn, as the travel card chosen with the associated event can be virtually useless for future travel. Players cannot get too far behind no matter how well they are doing in days spent, but they also cannot race first into London with too many days on the itinerary and lose to someone making it in less days travelled. A balanced approach of waiting for cards and moving on to making the circuit is required for victory.

This game has been sitting on my shelf over 5 years unplayed I quess but now that I got it on the table I feel that it deserves a spot on the shelf. There's enough game in Around the World in 80 Days to satisfy the hardened gamers but it's easy enough to entertain the non-gamers too. Few years and this probably finds the table to be played with my kids.

Excellent, light, fast-paced family game. An instant hit with my 13- and 11-year-old niece and nephew. It resembles Ticket to Ride in some ways, but the timing element is what makes it unique: being in either first or last place can put you at a distinct disadvantage, but you get small benefits when you are the first or last to enter a city. Sometimes hanging back for a while can give you a huge boost if you're able draw the right cards, but can backfire if you can't. Lots of interesting decisions, for a short, very easy-to-teach family game. I also love the graphic design and the old-timey artwork.

I liked this one, with the caveat that it's definitely a family game, one adults can play with kids, and not a "gamer's" game. It is vaguely reminiscient of Jenseits von Theben, where time is spent as a currency, but this to me is a tighter, better-executed game. Honestly, it's just not one I'm every going to play a lot - family games are not my niche - but this is still a good entry. Not as good as the classics like Mississippi Queen, but still good.

Simple? Absolutely. Deep? Not at all. Fun--yes! This is a wonderful family weight game that takes about 1/2 an hour and is super fun. Even game players enjoy it as a filler. The theme certainly draws me, and the art work is fantastic for a light family game.

RATING: 6
Nifty little set action selection/collecting game with enough twists to make it interesting.

Players try to make it around the world as quickly as possible, but must carefully choose their timing.  Do you hang back and wait for better cards, or forge on to make sure you don't get too far behind?

This would make a great family game, but is still enough to hold the interest of hardcore gamers as well.

First play didn't reveal much.. of four players, I think most of us were bored of it within the first few minutes.  I did like that the game stuck to the theme so well, since a lot of theme-heavy games tend to fall apart at the rules.  (I also like the idea found here on BGG that crossing the international dateline would save each player one day, since it is a heavy theme in the book.)

RATING: 8
This game deserves more respect.  Theming is very strong and fun.  Artwork is nice.  Gameplay is light but absorbing.  You are confronted with novel tactical decisions every turn.  There's plenty to occupy your mind, between first-arrivals, last-arrivals, collecting doubles, choosing between better cards and better powers, and watching your opponents' situations.  Luck plays a role, but one that adds spice and variety to the game.  Only drawback I can see at this point is that it's about 95% tactics, very little conceptual strategy, which could limit replayability, but hasn't yet.

Not the greatest game but always gets pulled out as it is a great game to bring out for new player's to games. Has a little of everything and is not complicated. If it was not for it's ease and replay I am not sure it would be played much. Eh, I would still like it.

This is a light-medium keeper. There's something so sedately enjoyable about this game. I find it relaxing and without frustration. There are meaningful choices you need to make each turn, but I'm still wondering to what degree you can control your fate. I think the rules are a bit fiddly to teach to newbies, who nonetheless enjoy the game. It's not too fiddly. Also, as a component, I don't love the tiny round counters, but I can live with them. I love the mechanic of choosing among displayed cards which are also associated randomly with a specific action. That may be, for me, the second of two mechanics I've seen games make races interesting over multiple plays (the other mechanic is gambling).  The artwork here, and visual design of the game, are superlative. For some reason I've won this game most of the time I played--luck or not? I don't know.  Update: OK I've lost a game, though still clocking in well under 80 days each time, so I'm convinced the choices here are meaningful, it's not all luck!

Fun, well-themed family racing game. 2 contradicting objectives (hurry up but don't use up too many resources) create a lot of tension. Finding the right balance is key.

This strongly reminds me of Knizia's Marco Polo (which strongly reminds me of Ticket to Ride which strongly reminds me of Elfengold)...and against that particular game I'd give it the mild nod mainly due to theme and a dash of extra tactical options via the detective and so forth, but this game is still fairly bare bones and didn't really engage me that much. Collect sets, lay em down, and try to get back to home spending as few days as possible along the way. Neat thematic idea, but I would really like to see it used a little more tightly (or more depthily I guess) than it was here. This is saved from sub-average by the interesting special power system where players can sometimes end up taking sub-optimal cards because they want a given power though...I quite like that and would like to see it reused in a heavier, more interesting game.

Fairly straightforward race game.  No real choice in terms of routes, so game play is simply a matter of optimizing tactical play.  I'd expect replay value suffers as a result.  But the game is simple to teach, and would work as a filler or in mixed groups with non-gamers.

What I Liked:
* More game in it than what you would expect!
* Everything in the game is useful and helps to balance or speed up flow of play.
* Game ends on the turn the second to last player gets to the finish, creates tension and keeps people moving.

What I Didn't like:
* Picked up a copy for $5, although wouldn't have got it at RRP.
* Simple mechanic but there are about a dozen other rules you have to remember that apply in certain circumstances, these can easily be missed.
* Plays better with more people

Overall:
Nice light game suitable for both gamers and non-gamers. The event cards seemed a bit unbalanced to me and unless you used them on the same turn we all seemed to constantly loose them in a 6 player game. Perhaps that is the idea, but it gets annoying for the player.

The novelty wore off quickly for me. Everyone follows an identical route and thus tries to do the same things at the same time as everyone else. The strategy is similar for all, so the card draws make the difference. Play with families, who might enjoy the theme, not with gamers.

Fun medium-light game with a little strategy and a great dose of tension.  This is not high strategy, but those who think it is a luck-fest have totally missed the careful balance of card selection, special action selection, and rate of movement all of which are crucial.  This game has grown on us over the years and aged very well.  The board artwork is gorgeous and it plays very quickly, even for the full 6 player load.  It even shines in the 5-6 player slot which is somewhat rare.  It's one of the few games whose rating I have raised over the years.

RATING: 7
Players spend train/ship cards to travel around the world from London to London.  The player who arrives back in London using the least amount of "days" (ie. points) wins the game.  Each train and ship card has a point value which indicates the number of days spent on this mode of transport.  These cards are drafted from a public display, with the card taken also corresponding to a game action (draw cards, gold, etc).  Balloons can be caught to lessen the time taken.  Elephant cards can help through India, etc.  All very retro in feel, but the game works well.  Four to five players appears to be the sweet spot for this game.  Good one for the families.  The presentation of the game is superb.

Probably deserving of Spiel des Jahres, in my very unexpert opinion.

Short, light, fun, and packs a lot of game into 45 minutes or so.   Lots of good little choices to make.  The more players the better (the included 2-player variant is next to useless).

I love lighter simpler games that don't have rules that get in the way of the game and interacting with people. And this is one of those that does it in spades. Just a fun card-playing race game where being in the lead on the board doesn't always mean you're winning. The hardest, though not too hard, element of the game is getting people to realize that it isn't about who ends first, but who ends most efficient. That being closest to the end doesn't mean that player is in first place. That also makes it hard to judge just how well you're doing. But that is also what makes it exciting up until the end. This will be a keeper for some times to come.

This one is deceptively easy to play, but there are lots of choices to make once it gets rolling.  The balance between rushing through each leg of the journey and trying to log the best times as you go is a very delicate one.  Excellent mid-level filler type game, our second game with six players took under an hour.

Not too bad. Players may be disappointed if they're expecting a racing game - the object is to finish with the fewest points, so the player who reaches London last may actually win.

Interesting physical issues: the huge box is almost empty, yet the board doesn't really fit into it. The game is really nice light fare. Card/action drafting, card-driven movement, low score wins. A little heavy on rules for such a light game, but pretty easy to teach.

RATING: 6
In our first game, the blue event cards ("Delay" and "Storm") came up a ridiculous number of times, frustrating our use of the event cards.  During our second game, we were more cognizant of the blue cards, and only had them hit once or twice.  Much better that way.

RATING: 6
It's an okay family game, with a Chance deck. That's enough to tip the scales against it for me. Bit too fiddly, but it is a neat sim of Fogg's journey and I liked the inverse scoring track. The fewer days you take, the better. Play before you buy.

RATING: 4
Played 1 time, with 5 players. I admit, my expectations for this game were fairly high. I liked the artwork, and the game has been described elsewhere as the child of "Papa" Cartagena and "Mama" Marco Polo's Expedition. I like Cartagena, but I do not enjoy MPE, and sadly, this little baby looks more like mama than papa. The progression was fairly linear (most of us moved at about the same rate, one space per turn), and the decisions never seemed all that interesting. I do think we had an unusually starightforward game, and hope my next playing will be much better. Off my "To Buy" list.

Family-style hand-management racing game with some light action selection thrown in.  Event cards add some luck and excitement. There's some interesting tension caused by wanting to use as few days as possible to travel, but also not wanting to arrive last in London, as the game is over when the 2nd last person arrives in London.  This is better than I thought it would be.

On the light/introduction style, this game is very good. There are at least two opposite strategies that both may work (completing it as [b]fast[/b] as possible vs. completing it as [i]fast[/i] as possible... anyway), which makes this one intriguing to new gamers. Still, I fear it might not live up to repeated play, so this rating may change.

RATING: 7
Firstly I am a fan of the thematic tie-in here. With that said, however, I still find 80 Days to offer that great balance between weight and game time.  80 Days is a unique racing game in which you are in a sense simultaneously running two races, albeit only one really matters for scoring.  The goal of the game is to circumnavigate the globe in less time than your competitors, this is done by drafting cards intermixed with performing various actions.  The two aforementioned races are in game turns, and also in days (numbers on the cards played).  Although it is the days that ultimately matter, getting to London ahead in game turns puts pressure on people to hurry up or consistently recieve penalties.  This lowers their ability to try and create the best possible scenarios for them to travel.  The game forces you to react, and play tactically to the card draws but offers enough decisions forcing you to balance between risk and reward.  An exceptional gateway.

A fairly light family game that is easy to introduce to non-gamers. My 7 year old grasped it very fast. The card driven mechanic makes it enjoyable and the actions associated with which card you choose can make for some interesting strategizing. We really enjoy this one when it hits the table!

RATING: 8.5
I like this relatively light game.  To me it hits a kind of sweet spot -- it's heavier than a "filler" game, but on the light end of things.

The choices are rarely agonizing, but there are enough of them to keep the game interesting.

Nice tension, nice theme.

There is a serious king maker problem that effects about a third of the games, but if you're game group has good meta-game ethics (i.e., people generally play to maximize their score in such bald king maker situations) it's a minor problem.

Not exactly a gateway (there are a few fiddly bits to this) but instead a family game with some nice tension between speed (traveling city to city) and accuracy (not spending too many "days" to accomplish that). Most games have a close finish, which is a plus.

[Original comment] This game is great! I have won, and I have failed to finish. I do not yet have it mastered (if that is possible). There is enough randomness to make it impossible to devise a definite winning strategy, and in a 5-player game, the situation changes significantly every turn. But, there are ways to overcome the setbacks in many cases. I think it is extremely well-designed and the artwork on the board is candy for the eyes.

(December 2006) We are now playing this with 7 players, with one modification we made {see: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/147840}. It is an excellent game for 7, and I like to play it as often as possible.

May 2009 -- This continues to be one of my favorite games.

October 2011 -- This is still one of my favorite games. I could play it every week and not tire of it.

November 2012 -- I can play this game at any time, and I often select it for our family game days, when it's my turn to pick games.

2013-November: This is still one of my favorite games. I love the theme, the mechanics, the artwork on the board, and virtually everything about this game.

RATING: 5.5
Fun little "chase" game as player's try to be the first to get back to London. Reminds me a bit of the Ticket To Ride series as you have to sufficient cards to make it from one spot to another on the board.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This game didn't do too much for me, as there are not that many different strategy choices, and you seem basically totally at the mercy of the bonus cards you draw.
(Draw an elephant when in the right place or draw a card that let's you travel two places in one turn and you have huge advantage, for example.  Other cards are worth little)

As a light game or family game, it actually could work very well if you like the theme/time period, but I'd prefer to play other games like Ticket to Ride with family instead of this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Excellent family game, too light and fluffy for hard-core gamers because of the high amount of luck (e.g. Storm/Delay cards) even though a lot of choice is possible. The other half seems uncannily good at this; maybe there's not as much luck as I think.

Sold in my March 2014 geeklist auction.

Components: good quality
Complex: easy to learn and teach
Weight: family game
Players: 4 or 5
Length: around 60 mins
Mechanics: racing
Decisions: which card to select, which action, should I travel now...
Opinion: finally played it, long time wishing to do so, and the game is worth it. It is a simple family game, pick up cards and select when to travel.
With this simplicity you have a nice family game. You have to make the travel around the world, and you have the time mechanic to keep track of that. So you have to pick up cards (train or ship) and use them to cover the different steps of your journey. But there is the detective that can ruin part of your journey.
The game is really simple, but really funny. You only have to choice which card, from the ones available, you need, and if you are going to travel this turn or not. But could have some nasty elements. The detective played by a nasty guy could make lot of hurt, but in a delicious way.
The time track is funny, you have to do the travel in less than 80 days, but you can keep control on what others are doing, so you can finish the journey in more than 80 days if this could lead you to victory.
Summary, is a game with really simply rules that can be played by almost everybody, and have fun during an hour

RATING: 9
After my first couple of plays, I wrote: "Not bad, but it's probably too light for gamers and may be too fussy for others.  I would happily play again, but wouldn't want to play it often." *Update* My evaluation of the game has improved markedly after a few more plays.  The game is skillfully designed to create drama and tactical decisions all the way to the finish line.  There are reasons to zoom out ahead of the pack, there are reasons to hang with the pack, and there are reasons to lag behind slightly.  Until the end, it's hard to tell who is truly winning, and this allows the excitement to build and build all the way through the game.  Around the World in 80 Days is in many ways a simple game, yet it forces you to struggle against it on many levels at once: getting the right special action, finding low-numbered cards, finding matching cards, finding the right train/boat mix, managing your hand, rationing your gold, attempting to be the first or last into a city, avoiding the detective, avoiding being the last to finish, and making sure to beat the ticking 80-day clock.  It's not astrophysics, but it's surprisingly multi-faceted for such a light game.  I've played with every configuration from 3 to 6 players, and the game scales well through that entire range.

The type of family game Hasbro should make! While seasoned strategy gamers won't stretch their little grey cells, do the game provide enough decisions to make it interesting to play with your family or non-gaming friends. 

The luck of the draw is reduced by letting the players pick their cards from a an open display of cards where each card is attatched to a specific action, which often gives you some interesting choices: good card or good action? Very nice game!

Really nice family game - imho not as much luck in it, and offers enough but not 'too much' tactics. I see also interaction in that way, that you can't do it the 'cheap' way when the other players start to rush. Finally I was in front of London - more then perfect in time... but last in game. Was good fun!

This is yet another set collection game for the family, a bit like Marco Polo which I dislike.  However, I really dig the theme and strategy might be a minor factor but is present nevertheless.

For some reason this grew on me for the second play. Up from a 4 to a 6. Maybe I was just in a better mood? Who knows. Anyway Thebes is still better and uses the similar time spending concept. But the time spending thing is pretty clever.

This one is OK. It's not bad, it's just not that great either. It's good for folks new to designer games I guess. For me I just race to the end without too much concern for accrued days. I've won 75% I've done it like this. Maybe my card draws were just really lucky (the most recent time this was the case).

Update: 7.5 from a 6.5 This one is really growing on me. It really works pretty well and it's a challenge to work with bad card draws. Plus the last 1 or 2 in the race losing automatically is a great incentive to not hold back and wait for better cards.

This game irks me in its randomness.  Taken alone, I wouldn't mind the travel cards, or the event cards, or the die.  Put all together, and played with enough people and this game becomes kind of not a game, but rather an activity.  Still, it's an ok activity.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.99
It is a "race" where you are trying to get around the board in the "fastest" amount of time. The "time" you have spent is recorded along the edge of the board. This is more important than how many turns you spend accomplishing this (though doing it in the fewest turns is helpful too).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A relatively simple game, but enjoyable and plays quite well with 5 or 6 people.  The fly in the ointment are the bad special event cards which make everyone throw away any other special event cards they hold.  :-(

1st played 12/27/07. Taught in <10min played ~1hr w/ 6 players. Good luck/strategy balance. Players race around globe in least action time. Players dealt starting hand of cards, a coin & starts in London. Deck consists of ship (#'ed 4-8) & train (2-6) cards. The # on cards = # of days required to move. Each round cards are placed face up at the bottom of the board next to a special action. The # of cards placed is 1 more than the # of players (max 6) in play. Special actions are: get a coin, balloon option this round (roll dice instead of a card #), draw a special card, move detective, be start player next round, & discard 0-3 cards for = # from draw pile. 1 coin= re-roll, or 2 coins= 1 draw deck card. Players ending turn in same location as detective is questioned & takes 2 extra days. Players move around the board # of spaces= days used. To move, a player places required ship/train cards & moves. If 2ship/2train are required/used & are the same #, the move takes the # of days of 1 card instead of both. Special cards include mostly good & some bad cards. One is elephant which can be used to get to Caletto. If bad card is drawn, all cards are shuffled. Strongly recommended gameplay (borrowed/know someone) & purchase consideration.

After only 1 game, I'm not sure there would be a compelling reason to play again. Nice game but nothing stands out and it's not particularly interesting or fun. It's not long, so perhaps not a bad choice for 4-6 players, but seems like not a very good choice either.

Interesting mechanics ideas but the execution leads to choices that aren't very compelling.

First play with 5 was outstanding, but I'm a bit concerned that if you get a great hand to start, you might have a big advantage, especially if you are the first player.

RATING: 7
A really fine game.  I think the frequent use of "family game" in describing it may be turning off the spielfreaks.  But, I think there is more going on here than in a lot of other well received designs.  Best yet, its closer to around the world in 80 seconds, even with 5.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A game based on the book of the same title which involved seeing who could be the first to race around the world in under 80 days. Coming in first however does not mean that you have scored the fewest days for the trip ... so the day track is quite a novel mechanism that adds some strategy to the game. If you are the last player to London however you automatically lose. Quite a well balanced game that usually provides a tight and exciting ending. Best with a minimum of three or four players and highly recommended for an hour long enjoyable ride.

Quite possibly the most beautiful game I play, and an excellent gateway game.  About the same weight as Ticket to Ride.  I enjoy the unique race mechanic (where the winner is determined not by game time but by "days" in the game), and my children didn't have trouble grasping it.  
Be sure to play it with Nick Fisk's thematically brilliant variant of picking up a day when a player crosses the international date line.  No added complexity, but fits perfectly.

A nice light-medium game that plays fairly quick.  A 6 player game shouldn't take more than 60 minutes.

Not a lot of hard decisions to make and the luck element is high, but the game is just plain fun to play.

My only complaint is that because of the high luck element, there is a distinct 'kingmaker' element in the endgame, so it's probably best played with four.

Decent game, hard to keep your trip under 80 days.  We have usually had to determine winner by first to London.

Around the World in 80 Days is a pretty unique and quite enjoyable racing game.  I like that there's a couple of things going on.  You don't necessarily want to be the first to get back to London, you just want to take the least amount of days.  On that same note though, you don't want to be last to London, because you can lose (unless you can get into London on the last turn).  It's definitely best for more players (at least 5), but it still works well at lower player counts.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The casual gamers I've played this with have enjoyed it - a little bit more than me, unfortunately. Players draft cards in order to construct efficient sets for traveling to destinations in a trip around the world. While the first player to return to London gets advantages, it is ultimately the player who makes the journey in the fewest days (read, "lowest valued cards") that wins. That double view of time - pawns moving from city to city and a separate track that equates to days spent (consisting of the total value of cards played + penalties) is an interesting aspect to the game. Events can mix things up a bit. You can also slowly collect money and use it to buy cards or make re-rolls on a balloon ride. It's not a bad game at all, I just think there are gateway games out there that a little more involving - such as Ticket to Ride and Catan. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Pleasant, Light game with rich theme.
Not a hard-core gamers game, but good for non-gamers and older kids.  The logic of the mechanics will grate with some, your move on a score track represents the time it takes to travel round the world, yet people in the same location (even though by the logic of the game they are there at different times) get caught and delayed by the detective when their pieces are in the same location on the board.  Its not worth worrying about - just take the game for what it is - light and entertaining.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A pleasant light game. Players race around the map, with some small incentives to be out front and hang back. There's also a "detective" that can be used to pull back a leader, though the impact is mild. 

I wouldn't want to play this that often but it's well put together and has enough character to put it above many other light games.

A light family game that has enough dimensions to weigh against each other to still be interesting for gamers as well. If you enjoy games like Ticket to Ride, Transamerica or the 10 days-series, this one should be fine for you as well. There's a medium luck factor and sometimes there's absolutely nothing you can do to gain an advantage. But for the length of less than an hour that's ok. Another big plus is its true scalability from 3-6 players.

Played it three and five player now.  This is not as light as it first would seem.

This has a little bit same taste than the games I played when I was a kid.

I appreciate this nifty unique racing game a little bit more each time, the more I play it.  Nice little multi-player unorthodox racing game where players traverse the world.  Reaching the final destination doesn't guarantee victory.  The race is measured by days, so fewest days usually wins.  Card management and board tactics is important in finishing early.  What makes 80 Days "unusual" compared with other racing games (besides the fact that taking an elephant trip is faster) is that you aren't guaranteed victory just because you arrive at London first.  To qualify, you must be one of the first 4 to finish (all other laggards are ineligilbe).  The winner is whoever makes the global trip in the "fewest days" before the game ends (when the 4th player reaches London).  Box for this game should have been halved and is a bit oversized for the low quantity of components in the game (there's more air in the box than game bits).

RATING: 6
Just because you get to the finish line first does NOT mean you will win.  One seeks to combine different train and ship cards, preferably low matching numbers, to get around the world in the least amount of days.  Rewards are available for the first person to reach a city and the last person to leave each city (catchup mechanism?).  One adds the number on the cards together to represent how many days it takes to move to the next city (different cities require different combinations of trains and/or ship cards).  If two cards match in type and number, then you just have to count one of the cards as days travelled (i.e. two ship cards each valued at 6 days means instead of 12 days you only move your counter 6 spaces...a 7 ship card and 5 ship card means a 12 day journey).  Great family game which is learned rather easily.

Wow, what an awful game. I think Michael Rieneck hates us for making this one. It took SO LONG for such a basic luck driven title, I was pratically begging to stop and play Hare & Tortise. Also found it very annoying that they have this big box for absolutely nothing. A tiny deck of cards, a few counters and a board that should have fit in something half it's size. $37.95 MSRP? This would have left me furious at $19.95 let alone almost double. Rar!

Un juego basado en una obra de Verne solo puede provocar en mí amor. Si además es una más que trepidante carrera por dar la vuelta al mundo inspirada en una de sus novelas más apasionantes, en mi grupo de juego (mis sobrinos) funciona a la perfección. Lo hemos agotado un poco, cierto, pero le tenemos mucho cariño.

Quick fun game. Theme is VERY present and well integrated. The cleverness of mechanism is awesome: 
- bonus chips for first AND last

Easy to learn, easy to understand, lots of little cardboard bits. The size of them is annoying, but they don't hurt the game play any since they tend to stay put until revealed, and that is a minor part of the game anyway.
I wish that they could have incorporated the "betting slip" that they give you into the game; more than just being a player color indicator. Why not add a form of betting?

Handling six players is an elusive quality for Eurogames as is, and actually being enjoyable with that number is even rarer. The fresh approach to Jenseits von Theben’s time track is also well done, especially since it integrates very well with the theme.

As with other Rieneck games, a lot of independently simple mechanisms add up to a whole that may not be elegant, but very intriguing. This game feels less scripted than his other efforts, however, possibly because the players can set the pace themselves and there are no global, game-changing events. Highly recommended for six players, and probably not a bad choice with less.

3 Plays - This is a great family game. It's light...but it has some nice tension. It's about the same weight as Ticket to Ride. Replay value may not be there...but I can see this hitting the table a number of times. Last played 3/14/2008.

This is an oddball game. It's low on interaction, but the limited level of screwage available (via the detective) is enjoyable. I love the fact that getting to the finish line first doesn't necessarily correlate to winning the game -- it's a neat concept. Great components and a fun role selection aspect round out an enjoyable package.

I suck hard at this game, but have a good time whenever we play.

After a couple of years with little to no interest in seeing this hit the table, though, I sold it.

Played 10-15 times. Nice, light game with good evocative graphics. The game has a very friendly feeling as there is not much you can do to hinder other players. Competetion is still fierce towards the end of the game. Estimated playing time is correct, about 60 mins with four players. A versatile game to have in your collection. It accomodates 2-6, is easy to teach and learn, is not too light and has some atmosphere with a good and not overused theme.

Played 3 player several times, 5 player once. Plays well with experienced and with new gamers, as well as with younger players (We played with our 6yo). Good as a gateway game; although new players may be scared by the number of rules and unfamiliar system, they will settle in after the first round or two. I especially like the two timelines (order in game versus days on track).
Updated - well this has really fallen off the radar; I don't think we've played it in the last 2 years or so. Biggie still asks for it occasionally, though. Rating left for now.

It's a bit hard to work out who to hit in this game as just because someone is closer to finishing the game doesn't mean they're actually leading the game. So who do you hit? No one really, minimal interaction being just the card draft & moving the Fat Controller about, otherwise just churn your cards looking for the lower ones or pairs. Yet another "take it or leave it" game.

RATING: 9
Very good. It combines some nice mechanics (card drafting, action selection, standard race game) with a clever twist (two different "race" goals) and is well executed. The clever part I especially like: each player is completing both to get back to London first (fewest number of game turns) as well as first (fewest number of "days" spent by playing cards). The game mechanics work out nicely such that these goals are somewhat in conflict; by delaying an extra game turn or two, you can likely finish the race in a fewer number of days. The way the win conditions are set up (must finish in under 80 days and must not finish last in game turns), it works rather well. This isn't a "big hit" kind of game, but it's fun. Especially if you enjoy unusual race games. It has a slightly similar feel to Marco Polo Expedition.

Racing game with a twist - winner isn't the first player in London, but the one who does the trip best. Good, light fun. Would be a great family game, gamers with an interest for lighter games shouldn't avoid this one either.

Mechanics are clever and there's certainly some tactical depth. Should I stay or should I go? One can't fall too far behind, but gathering strenght is often better than rushing ahead. Two-player game isn't much, though; I'd rate that as 5 or 6.

Looks like a decent game. Won't win awards, but very nice art.

You draw cards which you play down to move around the board. Cards of the transportation types (train, boat, etc) have different numbers. You add them and that is the travel time. The person to use the fewest days around the board wins.

I played this as a three-player game and enjoyed it quite a bit.  I understand it plays six (and is still enjoyable with that many), which would be a very good feature.  I didn't find  it innovative or particularly different, but it was a tight game, good for families and non-gamers.

Excellent family-weight racing game! I wasn't expecting much going in, but this was a lot of fun. It has a similar vibe to Ticket to Ride, with a pinch of Snow Tales added in with the card play. While the game is pretty on-rails in terms of how you progress, there's a surprising amount of variation between the event cards, the investigator token, and trying to time your travels when they'll be most effective. You either want to be first to each location, or last. Also, if you lag too far behind the group, you risk losing automatically for being the last to arrive in London. This is just a very fun and simple Euro that is way more than the sum of its parts. I'm very surprised that this continues to be out of print.

The scoring is very clever, recreating the feel of a race and rewarding those who, in game turns, finish first, not just those that actually finish first.

Juego muy aburrido, lento y con muy pocas posibilidades de generar estrategia. Dependes mucho de las cartas que robas y da mucho espacio para AP haciendo lento y tedioso para el resto de los jugadores.
El arte y los componentes del juego son lo mejor que éste tiene, sin duda se invirtió mucho más en estos detalles que en la jugabilidad del mismo. Una pena.
----------
Boring game, slow and with limited possibilities to generate strategies. You depend mainly on card drawing, and it gives a lot of room to AP (Analysis Paralysis) making it way too slow and tedious for the rest of the players.
The art and components of the game are the best it has, no doubt most of the time was invested in this matter rather than the game playability. A pity.

RATING: 8
I agree with others that this is an excellent family game, particularly for families that are composed largely of 'non-gamers.' It's pretty easy to learn and play. 

The rules are well written and the game board is beautiful. I like the wooden meeples, and the cards, though small, have nice artwork. I like the tension of the game, the number and variety of choices, and that the feel of the theme comes through in play. 

Although the routine of game play doesn't change much from game to game, there is the constant challenge of figuring out how to shorten one's trip to somehow come in at 80 days or less. On that note, experienced players teaching newbies should give them some strategy tips for how to save time, as the only caveats for younger players is that without the right cards, one can potentially get stuck in one location for quite a few turns and hence might get frustrated, or, either certain cards or 'the detective' can get placed on them to cost them a day or two delay. 

The only reason I don't rate it higher than "8" is because game play is basically the same each time out, so it's not the kind of game that lends itself to playing many times successively. At the same time, it presents the challenge of figuring out how to play cards and make moves to reach London in fewer than 80 days, while trying to add days to one's competition. 

I really feel that games such as "Around the World in 80 Days," "Scotland Yard," "Ticket to Ride," "Settlers of Catan," "Carcassonne," Mission: Red Planet" and "Pandemic" should be the new staples at family game tables. 

Increased rating from 7.5 to 8 in January 2014.

RATING: 7.5
This is a really nice medium weight game. It gives you the feeling of traveling around the world but trying to beat the 80 days record. The game play is simple and a bit challenging. Use your train and/or boat cards to travel from city to city. Each card costs you a number of days travel...so its best to use the lowest valued cards possible.

I really like this as a nice light game for 5 or 6 players that has decent decision making throughout. The game is about obtaining low valued cards (which represent days travelling) in the types of sets that are required for your next few turns to move from location to location around the world. Each card you take will be aligned with an action (become new start player, swap cards, etc) so it's all good when a useful card appears under the action you want, but usually there's a decent decision to make on whether to take the action you really want with a not-so-good card or take the good card over there. It's also a race game where the player coming into London last can't win unless they come in on the same turn as the second last player, so you may need to play non-best cards in order to advance so as not to fall too far behind. And there's the pressure of the detective - if you stay in the same city you'll be punished with an extra 2 days, so there's pressure to take the action to move him out of the way, or play sub-optimal cards to move on. There's a lot of luck in the cards, but turns are fast, there's lots of good decisions to make, and the theme is fabulous. It fills a niche for 6 players that doesn't have a lot of coverage.

This game is really nice! It looks stunning, very elegant visual design. The game play is just a perfect balance between luck and planning. Simply can't say no to a game of this. Probably the most outstanding family game in my collection. It's an instant hit for non-gamers. Brilliant!

I had it rated an 8 in July 2008, now, 23rd of July 2011, I just upped it a notch to 8.5! Stood the test of time, and just improved a bit! Just beautiful this game!

Preliminary rating based on 1 play.  While I enjoyed the game, I'm not sure about this one.  Seemed like going first was important as the later pickers had very few choices.  Didn't help that we kept getting the blue event cards.  I think only half a dozen regular event cards got played in the whole game.

RATING: 7
The first several games we played -- all were with our (now) 10, 8, and 6 year old boys -- were difficult:  longer than expected, tedious, plodding.  However, everything came together in the most recent playing...the game was quick, tense, lively, and ended up with me winning by one point over my wife and by four points over my 8-year-old.  The 7 rating reflects the sum of all our plays; if the game continues to play like it did recently, the rating will climb to 8, but if it reverts to the long, painful mess, the rating will drop to 5 or 6.

This was a nice surprise.  I'm not crazy about Ticket to Ride, so I expected not to enjoy this, but I liked Around the World more.  The luck element isn't too off-putting, as you generally choose your own path, and the hosing that goes on is also pretty fair, rarely ruins the game, and is generally avoidable at a small cost.  Has more decisions to make than vanilla Ticket to Ride, too.  I'm concerned, though, about re-play value.

RATING: 6
I'm often a big advocate of scoring tracks which tunes you to your status and amplifies tense/hopeless feelings in a session. Interestingly, in 80 days you need to be furthest behind to win and sometimes your score is illusionary, as you need to take into consideration where you are on the map to determine how well/bad your status is. So this element subtracts from the racing tension alittle from the experience. However, this has gameplay that I like where basically you play the odds, and you think sequentially the order of play which will favour you, be it an associated action from the drafting area (which is novel) or using your coins when you feel the time is right. The drafting, the event cards, detective and die rolls add tension and humour. Sadly, the end game for competitors can be anticlimatic when it becomes obvious who will win. My rating has dropped a notch because text card reading holds up the pace (I still don't know the event deck), there is nothing to maintain your interest out of turn (except watch pick ups) and I'm also finding the linear feel of the play becoming monotonous. Some players perceive the detective as a mean option, and some get frustrated with the grey event cards forcing discards. Rating falls with more than 4 players are involved.

Neat theme and a couple of good ideas in this light game, but the game play can be very frustrating. Luck of the drwan cards dominate the game and determine the game play and the little decision making there is. Will play this again reluctantly if nothing better is available.

I very nice game that is a good intro to role selection.  Though it can be difficult for some to grasp the differences between speed and efficiency on this one.  One place I think it really excels is with a larger group and is great with the max of 6 players because the turns are fast and it opens up the roles for selection, and in general make the game tighter and tenser.  I think it an under appreciated gem, and a pretty decent gateway game especially if you are wanting to later move into games involving role selection.

RATING: 7
A nice race game. You collect sets to complete each leg of the journey. Reasonably true to its theme, and a good introductory game,

I like how there is two time dimensions. The victory time where you want to use low travel cards to move and game time where the first and last player to a spot gets a bonus. The order that you finish is not as important as not being last or too far behind the first player to finish.

The mechanic of how selecting the travel cards is meshed with other things - moving the detective to interfere with others, the balloon to allow for different travel time, event cards, starting player... adds a nice decision element.

Around the World in 80 days is a great easy/fun game that I like to use as an intro game for people who may be unfamiliar to the world of game playing. The rules are uncomplicated and easy to pick up, and while a previous knowledge of the game will help, those playing for the first time are not necessarily fated to loose. Despite the simplicity of the game, it is still enjoyable and challenging to play for the experienced game player.

A somewhat light game of trying to play the lowest cards you can so you can make it across the world in the smallest amount of days. It has an amazing theme I wish I saw more games use, but I'm not a huge fan of the incentive to hang back and be the slowest person to get to each place, and also the Storm cards that reset all the event cards, including those in people's hands, is pretty brutal and really took some players by surprise in a bad way, almost to a rage quit. But overall I enjoyed it and would recommend it.

Kind of race game, but with some particularities, based in the famous novel by Jules Verne. The winner is not necesary the firts to arrive to the finish line, located in London, but the player that uses less days in doing so, which is not the same. Besides that, the game is mostly about getting card combos to optimize your trip. Good to play with the family, but avoid it when playing with gamers. It just wouldn't pass the test in this case.

I've only been able to play this game a single time, but I did very much enjoy it.  I look forward to getting a couple of more games in and will likely purchase it in the future.  I ended up losing because I forgot about the balloon and the double card uses.  I'm also not sure I think that the reward for getting to London first is worth the trouble.  We shall see.

I like this, more than others I believe. It is a game that can be played with the family as long as they can think in Euro game terms. Like the fact it can be strategic to stay in last and collect small rewards. Nicely balaced and I can see it lasting many plays.

Around the World in 80 Days -- Played once, four-player.

The initial card deal and turn order can be devastating.  (It was for Rich and me — Rich had high numbers, and I had only train cards.)  While choosing a card from the display can help ameliorate this, players can add only one card per turn, and only from the cards remaining at the time of their turn.  (Exception:  Coins allow the occasional purchase of additional face-down cards.)  By the time I had managed to achieve some balance in my hand, the other players were well ahead of me.

Nevertheless, I like the game. While I don't feel the need to purchase it, I do feel that the game is well-designed.  It moves along at a fair pace, and holds players' interest.  The event cards introduce an element of chance which offers both hope and jeopardy.

While it doesn't "wow" me, it certainly offers enough interesting elements — particularly the balancing act created by trying to reach London in the fewest travel days while not taking too many turns to so do.  The second-to-last arrival in London triggers game-end, so while a player may want to take some turns to collect cards which reduce his travel days, he can't afford to fall too far behind the pack.  And players can't conspire to take their time holding off that second-to-last arrival because once even one player arrives in London, all others begin accruing travel days each round.

With 5 or 6 players, all of the actions become available, and the game is said to become more interesting.  I won't be asking to play it (not with all the other games we have), but I'd be willing to give it another shot with more than 4 players.

RATING: 7
[2 plays] Some parts of this game are clever, others don't intrigue me as much. I like the (Thebes) type of scoring track that is a time tracker. I thought the card selection routine was pretty good. I'm just not sure that my fate is as strongly dictated by my actions as it is by my good or bad fortune.

Although I see this as a good potential family game, the rules explanation is a bit more complex than the payoff compared to other games of the same weight.

All of that said, I will happily play this again. I also think my 6 player experiences don't keep it moving rapidly enough to show the game in its most favorable light.

Most recent play July '16.

RATING: 6
Players travel round the world by playing travel cards (boat or train) of different values. Event cards along the way help or hinder travellers.

A nice touch is the detective (that can be moved by players) and delays anyone who ends a turn in that same spot.

Player who comes into London in the least number of days (not first) wins.

The punishing 12 day calcutta route is a killer. I don't like the luck of the elephant die roll. There are a fair amount of luck rolls that detract from the game.

 A solid entry level game that emphasizes hand management and set collection in a travel themed game. The mechanic of placing randomly drawn cards to a specific action infuses strategy into the hand management process. Streamlined with simple rules and steps making it great for non-gamers, and a medium-light filler that will satisfy most  seasoned gamers.

RATING: 7
An attractive-looking game that does a nice job of capturing the theme and feeling of the race. There is plenty of tension, a fair amount of luck (as there should be), and some strategy. I think this would make a good family game, not to mention a light geography lesson for the kids. It's not a brain burner, but it's certainly a cut above something like Pirate's Cove.

RATING: 9
The holy grail for me... finally got hold of a 2nd hand copy at a reasonable price via Amazon... And it doesn't let me down.

Excellent racing game, where the first one back to London is not necessarily the winner. All depends on how you play your travel/bonus cards to limit the amount of days you spend traveling to each destination.

Fairly simple to explain and wifey a fan. Shame the 2 player version is not great as really needs 4+

Only minor niggles are the last turns can be a little anti-climatic (especially if you're lagging behind), and the Storm/Delay cards can be brutal. But then again it stops you hanging on to bonus cards for too long... so use them or weep :)

An attractive enough game, with nice bits and a pretty board.  Has a "Ticket to Ride" feeling, but the gameplay seems rather prescribed and linear.

There are a lot of great games out there, this sadly is only good enough.  The theme has its appeal, but there isn't a whole lot of fun here.  The mechanics feel systematic and repetative. 

All in all this is just a numbers requirement game.  Do I have the right card combos? Yes/No : Progress/Don't Progress.  I don't find anything wrong with this kind of system, I like Marco Polo (although MP is superior as the cards are dual purpose), I just feel like it isn't covering any new ground.  

Regardless, there is actually a worthwhile enjoyable game here, that makes this a great intro to newbies.  The roles with the drafting give a nice twist.  Sadly, not enough to make me overly excited to play this again.

UPDATE: Well, years later I played it again.  Still feel the same way.  Pretty dull and random.  The art is great though...

A relatively simple and straightforward game. We played it with three players, and it takes about half an hour -- it is nice, because otherwise it might even get boring, as there is rather little action (or rather strategizing and thinking) involved. With a game as simple as this, there should be a winning strategy, but we need to play it more to find out!

RATING: 8
A very fun game with a nice mix of luck and strategy, good endgame conditions, and a tight thematic connection to the mechanics. My two complaints are a) the HUGE box relative to the components and b) the two blue cards in the event deck seem to disrupt the game too much. I will play with just the one from now on. EDIT: Stripping one blue card out just made hoarding too easy. I've upped my rating by 1 after more playings. It plays equally well with 3,4, or 5. EDIT: After a friend got totally hosed on the blue cards, I decided to implement the following - if a blue card is drawn, everyone advances one space and in addition, there is a two card hand limit so there is no hoarding. I think that solves all of our problems.

On first appearances, its a light family game, but there's plenty to deal with - hand management, role selection (& blocking other players from taking a role), timing of event card acquisition and the risk of the disaster cards, the detective, and the lovely clock which pressures you into maintaining a reasonable average for travel costs if you want to get to London in under 80 days.

You do have to pay attention to card planning if you don't want to spend weeks in Yokohama!

29-Nov-08: The concept sounds simple and great. Similar to TtR, players pick cards from a selection of 6, but alongside each card is also an associated Action which you can take. These range from discarding and drawing more cards, to Hot-air ballooning, to moving the Detective which delays other players. Then, players play cards to move their pawn around the world. The Time Track is a novel idea, similar to Thebes. 

However, the game simply plays too long with 6 players. Being a tactical game, there's little you can do outside of your turn apart from wait. And the decisions you make on your turn are fairly light. I think I'd prefer to play this with 3-4 players in the future to keep it as it is - a light, filler-type game that should end in 45 mins instead of 1.5 hours.

A beautiful blend of the traditional roll and move mechanic with Euro role selection.  I've had the most success introducing non-gamers to modern boardgaming with this title.  I'm often surprised that there aren't more games similar to this one (let me know if you can think of any).

The components are top-notch.  The board is a work of art.  The theme works well with the race aspect of the scoring track.  Whenever we play, there is always a misperception that the player in the lead is winning the game.  Around the World is a truly enjoyable experience.  I highly recommend it to those who have never played.

At the End I comments this great family game.

I have special affection to this game. I believe that the run's games are my favorite, since in them each action conditions your following action, you have had that to think the strategy and in the third or four round already realize the errors that have committed. A lot of tension breathes this game.  

I do not believe that the factor luck of this play be high, this in its just balanced. And always it is very entertained to see as your opponent remains with the card that you needed or like this making a mistake that benefits you without being given account... before these things are commented and they serve us to learn more and laughing a while.  

And clearly it is fun, fast, a very pretty design and the board...

#----0----# 

Al final he puesto los comentarios de este gran juego familiar.

Tengo especial cariño a este juego. Creo que los juegos de carreras son mis favoritos, ya que en ellos cada acción condiciona tu siguiente acción, has tenido que pensar la estrategia y en el tercer o cuatro turno ya te das cuenta de los errores que has cometido. Mucha tensión respira este juego.

Yo no creo que el factor suerte de este juego sea alto, esta en su justa medida. Y siempre es muy divertiro ver como tu oponente se queda con la carta que necesitabas o como esta cometiendo un error que te beneficia sin darse cuenta... despues de la partida, estas cosas se comentan y nos sirven para aprender más y reirnos un rato.

Y claro es divertido, rápido, un diseño muy bonito y el tablero...

Around the World in 80 Days is a well-executed family adventure game, but it constantly reminds you how much luck is involved.  Travel card picks, dice rolls, random chip flips, and event card draws give the player a constant stream of randomized things to react to.  Yes, the better player will ride the wave to success, but any sense of control and tension is lost.  It's a fantastic interpretation of the book, however.

My favorite gateway game.

Scales well from 3-7 (yes, the box says 6, but works well with 7 if you use a variant in the files section where the last choice is two cards), beautiful components, fun for ages 10 and up.

Fun race game with two interesting ways to win.

Two complaints:  (1) It can play slightly long for a game this light.  It takes over an hour with more than 5 if there are a couple newbies.  Even the rules suggest playing with less than 6 if it is a learning game.  (2) If the Storm and Delay events pop up unusually often this can be a bit of a bummer as people do not get many opportunities to use the event cards. Not sure if this is a valid complaint - use those cards dammit.

I love the theme and components and the ability to play with such a large range of players makes this one of my favorite games.

Update: Knocked rating down from 8.5 to 8. Nothing really wrong, I have just played it so many times.  I have also actually played with a group that didn't particularly enjoy it. 

It is still a very good game and I still enjoy playing, especially with 5-7 people.

Update:  Back to an 8.5.  I have been playing a lot recently and still love it.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 2
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 4
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4


Overall - 2

By reading the "far from perfect" rules, you may think the game is harder and worse than it really is.

For a 'family' game, not without some interesting decisions each round. Would like to play again, and try some other strategies.

This is a twist on your typical roll and move travel game in that you leverage a card drafting mechanic to collect the appropriate resources for travel. It's a race game, but it's not just the first to the finish. The game does a great job of employing a time element which must be carefully weighed against the actual piece order so tht neither can be allowed to fall too far beind. 

Overall I think it is very well put together. It does a great job of recalling the movie (though there is no feel of Jackie Chan in the game) and is accessible to a wide array of potential players. We often bring this out for non-gamer friends.

Had a lot of fun with this light strategy hand management race game. Wish this version wasn't out of print. Interested to see the new game with the same title and see if it scratches the same itch or is completely different.

RATING: 6
Pretty simple, with a nice theme overall.  Suffers a bit from randomness and/or chaos, but I guess that does work within the theme.  Decent choices offered, and usually the quickest players out of the gate do not win.

RATING: 7.6
I suppose people are rating this game low because of the Event Deck, which can wreak havoc on plans and strategies. I could almost see playing without it. But still, it's a fantastic gateway game which plays fast and introduces the concept of role-selection very nicely. I will never turn down a game of this.

This is a great family game - OK gamers will find it simple but for families or as a gateway game is very very good.

The game looks very good, has a good theme which works well,  componants are good, rules very simple and it plays very quickly with very little down time even with six players.

(2 plays) Nice, though I continue to think the decisions aren't so difficult for a gamer. One of the better racing games I've played -- with both the race in turns and the race in days happening simultaneously, it increases the tension. It is definitely an SdJ possibility, although the rules are more fiddly than (say) TtR.

RATING: 6.7
A nice blend between hand management, risk-taking, card drafting, set collection, racing, in one game. The association of special turn functions with simple travel card is the smart core, delivers strategies. The racing element keeps the game away from being a total optimization game. The detective placement generates direct player confrontation. Simple game but subtly tactical. Very very good gateway game, or when you dont want to play a heavy game.

Once upon a time, there were three games.  Cartagena: the papa game, Marco Polo: the mama game, and Around the World: the baby game.

Cartagena, the papa game, was a wise and elegant old game.  It knew that excess mechanics do not make for a better game, and it was simple, fast, and deep.

Marco Polo, the mama game, was also a fine game, but it had not learned this lesson.  It had bonus treasure, sneaky little tricks, and more card play.  The extra bits were interesting, but in the end it could not compare to or stand apart from the papa game.

The baby game, Around the world, wanted to find its own place in the world.  It did not wish to copy the papa game, so instead it tried to out-game the mama game.  It added the element of chance with die rolling and event cards, but it also helped mitigate that chance with variable actions and spending gold to re-roll.  It was unexpected and had lots of variety.  It did not fear the shadow of the mama game, and while it still could not match the wily old papa game, it could stand proudly on it's own.

P.S.  I just played a game where so many blue event cards came up that no-one could finish in 80 days.  The game does have a special condition for this, but we had one person who, with nearly perfect cards could have still made it, so after the first guy got back to london, the rest of us were playing a few turns with no chance of victory.  It was no fun at all, and I dropped the game rating a point as a result.

Played:  Once  This game falls under the catagory of "experience games."  If you like the story, then you may enjoy the game.  However, do not look towards this for a game with any choices, cause there aren't any.  When it is your turn, you either get lucky and move forward, or unlucky and don't.  Boring!

RATING: 10
Great 1hr game.  Fun, fast, everyone I've played it with likes it.  Light, with some strategy and trash talking.  Card taking/management and with the odd bit of dice rolling (minimal). Can be frustrating at times if the cards don't go your way, but still fun as a challenge to best your opponents scores.  You are always trying to beat your own record from earlier games.  Good for up to 6 players.  The more players, the greater the random and difficulty factor becomes.  Good game for newcomers to gaming also.

What a terrific gateway game.  I couldn't help but keep repeating, "what a great little game!"  I have a feeling that it will suffer some replayability, because the plot will be the same, with few differences.  This has jumped to the front of my favorite gateway games list.

RATING: 6
Light and fluffy, like the novel on which its based.  So fast that you'll be almost at the end before you know it.  I have a sneaking suspicion that your choices are more limited than it seems, and that sometimes it just isn't feasible to take, say, the action card, because the transportation card there doesn't fit with your hand.  Lots of tactical maneuvering in this game, between the detective and the bonuses for coming first and last players in a city.  The time dilation is a weird effect.  Hold on, so I'm further on in the journey, but I've spent fewer days than you, but we're still choosing from the same cards during the same turn?  It's like Einstein's theory of relativity in a board game, where time is different for all players, but still self consistent for every one of them. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Pick up cards, and play the cards as specified on the board to travel from one destination to another (two ships to move here, a ship and a train to move there, etc). Perfect pairs give you time savings over the printed values on the cards.

Not as fun as I had hoped, but we only played 2 player. It would be a decent choice for a non-gamer 6 player night.

Hm.  There are some interesting things going on in this game that fit quite well with the theme.  There's a +1 to its staying power right off the bat.  The turn order and cards can become a little frustrating, though, so that's a -1 to its skill check.  It plays quickly, though (+1), and there are some nice tensions as you try to plan through a move or two.  The time element adds a little something as well, especially since the person who's behind has a chance to sit tight and plan for a nice move, so long as he isn't left stranded at a location.  It's not a hardcore game by any means, but it allows for some nice choices, and is easily played with family.

RATING: 8
The 8 rating holds only with 5 or 6 players. With 3 or 4, I'd downgrade the rating to a 6 as you lose the interaction and crowd behavior that make the game enjoyable, not to mention the limitation in card/action choices; with 3 or 4 the choices seem less important because you have fewer players competing with you. Playing with 5 or 6 increases the playing time a bit, but the game can still move quickly if you poke everyone now and then.

To me, just not that interesting.  Decisions feel obvious, a lot of luck on what cards you get.  No real catch up mechanism, since you can get hosed if you try for special power cards if the reshuffle cards come up.

Overall, a who cares kind of game for me.

Played several times (with 3 to 6 players). An enjoyable racing game with a twist. The gameplay is easy, but there are still some decisions to make, and it runs pretty fast. There is some randomness in the cards (especially the blue event cards), but that only means that you should not base your strategy on them. Unfortunately, there is some text on hidden cards, which makes it a bit unsuitable for initiation purposes (it's quite surprising - and disappointing - no French publisher translated this one in 2005).

RATING: 6
Light, somewhat quick, and interestingly wasn't as shallow as I originally thought it to be.  Honestly, my first impression after looking at the board was a resounding "that's it?"  The design was mediocre, with only a handful of cities to traverse.  However, after playing it, I have to say I enjoy having to make the difficult decision between the card you want vs. the action you would like to choose, as well as denying your opponent(s) the choice that would most benefit him.  What I didn't care for was the gang-up-on-the-leader effect that will invariably happen, which would meant either the person closest to finishing the trek or the one with the least number of days traveled.  I'd rate the game as a decent and will occasionally play again type of title.

EDIT: I think if there was a way to screw the other player's traveling card(s) may make the experience more fun and chaotic, because as the game is right now, you have no way of delaying those that managed to get a jump ahead unless they were unlucky in drawing the right set of train/ship cards.

RATING: 3
Rating after one two-player game.  I don't know what to make of this.  It's light, but there's not a whole lot of game here.  I like the theme, but even that seems pretty pasted on.  Would like to try with more players to see if the tension rises.  Update: Well, played with 5 and I don't care for it very much.  Not enough angst in the decision-making.  Not very many meaningful decisions to be made, for that matter.  I can do without ever playing this again, though if someone really wanted to, I would.
